        <p>Background &amp; Aims: Outcomes of liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are determined by cancer-related and non-related events. Treatments for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have reduced non-cancer events among patients receiving liver transplants, so reducing HCC-related death might be an actionable endpoint. We performed a competing risk analysis to evaluate factors associated with survival of patients with HCC, and developed a prognostic model based on features of HCC patients before liver transplantation. Methods: We performed multivariable competing risk regression analysis to identify factors associated with HCC-specific death of patients who underwent liver transplantation. The training set comprised 1018 patients who underwent liver transplantation for HCC from January 2000 through December 2013 at 3 tertiary centers in Italy. The validation set comprised 341 consecutive patients who underwent liver transplantation for HCC during the same period at the Liver Cancer Institute in Shanghai, China. We collected pre-transplant data on etiology of liver disease, number and size of tumors, patient level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), model for end-stage liver disease score, tumor stage, numbers and types of treatment, response to treatments, tumor grade, microvascular invasion, dates and causes of death. Death was defined as HCC-specific when related to HCC recurrence after transplant, disseminated extra-and/or intra-hepatic tumor relapse and worsened liver function in presence of tumor spread. The cumulative incidence of death was segregated for HCV status.Background &amp; Aims: Outcomes of liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are determined by cancer-related and non-related events.

        <p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has become a leading indication to liver transplantation (LT), even if LT for HCC remains an unfinished product searching for perfectibility. 1 The recent introduction of effective anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) agents 2 together with the practice to downstage tumors originally thought to be ineligible for transplantation 3 could increase the number of HCC within the transplant waiting-lists [4][5][6][7] and lead to contrasts between cancer and non-cancer indications in the current scenario of persistent organ shortage.Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has become a leading indication to liver transplantation (LT), even if LT for HCC remains an unfinished product searching for perfectibility. 1 The recent introduction of effective anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) agents 2 together with the practice to downstage tumors originally thought to be ineligible for transplantation 3 could increase the number of HCC within the transplant waiting-lists [4][5][6][7] and lead to contrasts between cancer and non-cancer indications in the current scenario of persistent organ shortage.</p>

In fact, in case of HCC unadjusted survival, analysis may not fully discriminate among competing cancer and non-cancer events, hiding the observation of the events of interest during follow-up, particularly those cancer-specific 8 -as, for example, when death for causes other than tumor precedes the recurrence of the tumor itself.Cancer vs. non-cancer conditions are known to affect post-transplant outcome of individual patients, as well as liver function at the time of surgery, etiology of liver disease, co-morbidities, quality of the implanted graft and peri-operative management.

        <p>HCC have produced significantly longer survival expectations in case of tumor recurrence: that is, HCC diagnosis after transplantation, albeit a dreaded event, often do not represent a diagnosis of imminent death. 13 All these considerations underline the need for an appropriate analysis of competing events that occur in the natural history of LT for HCC. In competing-risk survival analysis the risks of death due to various causes can be discriminated so to produce a more reliable estimate of cancer and non-cancer related outcomes in respect to conventional survival analyses. To date, prognostication tools based on tumor parameters detectable pre-operatively and applicable to competing-risk analysis, are lacking.HCC have produced significantly longer survival expectations in case of tumor recurrence: that is, HCC diagnosis after transplantation, albeit a dreaded event, often do not represent a diagnosis of imminent death. 13 All these considerations underline the need for an appropriate analysis of competing events that occur in the natural history of LT for HCC.

        <p>In this study we sought at investigating the endpoint of cancer-specific survival in the setting of liver transplantation for HCC -namely considering as events of interest only those deaths caused by tumor recurrence. By means of competitive-risk analysis the independent oncologic determinants of cancer-specific survival were investigated with a prognostic model based on pre-transplant HCC features. This model and the related calculator may upgrade the current prognostic endpoints in this setting 14,15 and refine selection criteria for liver transplantation in patients with HCC.In this study we sought at investigating the endpoint of cancer-specific survival in the setting of liver transplantation for HCC -namely considering as events of interest only those deaths caused by tumor recurrence.

        <p>To produce a robust tool to predict post-transplant "HCC-specific survival" considering competing events, two parallel populations of patients were collected: a Western cohort (with HCV-prevailing chronic liver disease) for the training/internal validation set and an Eastern cohort (with HBV-prevailing background) for the external/independent validation set.To produce a robust tool to predict post-transplant "HCC-specific survival" considering competing events, two parallel populations of patients were collected: a Western cohort (with HCV-prevailing chronic liver disease) for the training/internal validation set and an Eastern cohort (with HBV-prevailing background) for the external/independent validation set.</p>

Incidental HCC found on the explanted liver and patients younger than 18 were excluded, as well as any kind of pre-operative portal vein thrombosis (PVT), in order to avoid misdiagnoses of non-neoplastic PVT, lack of shared protocols for PVT and any bias in evolution of diagnostic tools.

At whichever pre-transplant time-point, only nodules with a maximum diameter ≥1 cm counted as HCC nodules if meeting the EASL/AASLD criteria. 16,17 In particular, after neo-adjuvant treatments a tumor nodule was defined as active if showing at dynamic radiological imaging (contrast enhanced CT-scan or MRI) an enhancement in the arterial phase with venous washout even in the context of a necrotic nodule. In each nodule the maximum diameter was measured, including any concomitant necrotic areas. Response to neo-adjuvant treatments was assessed according RECIST 1.1 criteria, [19][20][21] also deciding to include in the definition of complete response the absence of contrast (pathological) enhancement in any of the treated nodules. Response to treatments were assessed locally but controversial cases were discussed and agreed collectively.In the training/internal validation cohort, data collection and analysis focused on different time-points during tumor and treatment history of each patient, as follows: For the validation set, demographic data, etiology of liver disease, last radiological staging before transplantation and follow-up data were collected.

        <p>To overcome the exclusive reliance on explant pathology of the Metroticket model, 11 the number of tumor nodules and size of the largest tumor were replaced by parameters measured on any vital HCC at pre-transplant radiology (see previous paragraph). Similarly, microscopic vascular invasion (mVI) -an exclusive pathology variable -was replaced by the last alpha-fetoprotein value available prior to LT. Since all these variables are known to have prognostic impact after LT for HCC, no additional analyses were performed in this regards. In addition, response to bridge therapies as prognostic parameter was captured by measuring tumor features of only vital tumors. Consequently, patients with complete response after neo-adjuvant treatments were considered as carrying zero nodules with zero diameter at pre-transplant assessment. As in the Up-to-7 criteria, the sum of number and size of the largest tumor, was considered as a whole. 11 Thus, three tumoral parameters combined into two variables (Number + Diameter and AFP levels) were included in the competing-risk regression. Considering that 81 deaths occurred as a consequence of HCC recurrence in the collected population the "ten events per variable" rule was satisfied, implying sufficient accuracy of regression estimates.To overcome the exclusive reliance on explant pathology of the Metroticket model, 11 the number of tumor nodules and size of the largest tumor were replaced by parameters measured on any vital HCC at pre-transplant radiology (see previous paragraph).

        <p>The competing-risk analysis 22 was planned by including these two variables into a multivariable model, performed on the training/internal validation cohort, through a 10-fold cross validation approach 23 . The failure event was represented by "HCC-related death" whereas "death for other than HCC" represented the competing event and was aimed at obtaining coefficients for the prediction of the risk of death due to HCC recurrence.

        <p>In this observational study conducted on 1058 Western patients transplanted for HCC, individual prediction of cancer-specific events in comparison with the non-cancer counterparts has been taken as main endpoint (Figure 1). Of note, outcome prediction was conducted using preoperative determinants of prognosis easily determinable in current practice (Figure 2), such as tumor morphology at conventional CT/MRI scan and the biomarker AFP, frequently associated with higher risk of pre-transplant tumor progression and poorer post-transplant survival. 25,27 Loading those variables in a web-based calculator freely accessible at www.hcc-olt-metroticket.org cancer-specific outcome in any individual patient can be objectivized. This facilitates decision on transplant eligibility at various time-points during patient history and particularly after completion of neo-adjuvant tumor treatments. This represents an improvement with respect to most prognostication tools based on post-transplant tumor pathology assessment and generate an applicable score for Centers that perform various forms of neo-adjuvant treatments.In this observational study conducted on 1058 Western patients transplanted for HCC, individual prediction of cancer-specific events in comparison with the non-cancer counterparts has been taken as main endpoint (Figure 1).

        <p>Detailed assessment of pre-transplant HCC treatment on post-transplant outcome was beyond the scope of the present analysis, being treatment protocols too heterogeneous among Centres to draw solid conclusions. As expected, efficacy of neo-adjuvant treatments was significantly correlated with HCC features and AFP (Table 2) and that excluded radiologic response as a covariate in the competing-risk analysis. This did not impede the resulting model prediction to be well applicable to the pre-transplant condition of individual patients with different presentation of HCC (Spearman correlation &gt;0.5). Lack of central review and adherence to the non-HCC specific response criteria are another bias of this study. However, the presented outcome data concurred in defining as active and measurable any HCC that after neo-adjuvant treatment is still showing at CT/MRI scan an enhancement in the arterial phase with venous washout, even in the context of a necrotic nodule. 20,21 Another potential limitation of the study is the variability of pre-LT imaging and techniques across the study period and among Centers. The impact of that on the presented results was not assessed, as it depends on several variables (i.e. comparative sensitivity and specificity of CT and MRI, inter-observer fluctuation in tumor assessment etc.) whose collection and analysis were beyond the scope of the study.Detailed assessment of pre-transplant HCC treatment on post-transplant outcome was beyond the scope of the present analysis, being treatment protocols too heterogeneous among Centres to draw solid conclusions.
