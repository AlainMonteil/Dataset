        <p>12. For patients with AF of greater than 48 hours or unknown duration undergoing elective electrical or pharmacological cardioversion, we recommend therapeutic anticoagulation with well-managed VKA (INR 2-3) or a NOAC using dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban or apixaban for at least 3 weeks before cardioversion or a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-guided approach with abbreviated anticoagulation before cardioversion rather than no anticoagulation (Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence).</p>
        <p>Remark: With NOACs adherence and persistence should be strongly emphasized 13. For patients with AF of greater than 48 hours or unknown duration undergoing elective electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion, we recommend therapeutic anticoagulation (with VKA or NOAC) for at least 4 weeks after succesful cardioversion to sinus rhythm rather than no anticoagulation, regardless of the baseline risk of stroke (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence) Remark: Decisions about anticoagulation beyond 4 weeks should be made in accordance with our risk-based recommendations for long-term antithrombotic therapy in recommednations 1 and 2, and not on the basis of successful cardioversion 14. In patients in which LAA thrombus is detected on TEE, cardioversion postponed, and OAC continued for another 4-12 weeks, to allow thrombus resolution or endothelisation, we suggest that a decision on whether a repeat TEE is performed should be individualized (ungraded consensus-based statement). 15. For patients with AF of documented duration of 48 hours or less undergoing elective cardioversion (electrical or pharmacologic), we suggest starting anticoagulation at presentation (low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin at full venous thromboembolism treatment doses) and proceeding to cardioversion rather than delaying cardioversion for 3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation or a TEE-guided approach (weak recommendation, low quality evidence). 16. For patients with AF and hemodynamic instability undergoing urgent cardioversion (electrical or pharmacologic), after successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm, we suggest therapeutic anticoagulation (with VKA or full adherence to NOAC therapy) for at least 4 weeks rather than no anticoagulation, regardless of baseline stroke risk (weak recommendation, low quality evidence).</p>
        <p>Remark: Decisions about long-term anticoagulation after cardioversion should be made in accordance with our risk-based recommendations for long-term antithrombotic therapy in recommendations 1 and 2 17. For patients with AF and hemodynamic instability undergoing urgent cardioversion (electrical or pharmacologic), we suggest that therapeutic-dose parenteral anticoagulation be started before cardioversion, if possible, but that initiation of anticoagulation must not delay any emergency intervention (weak recommendation, low quality evidence). 18. For patients with AF and hemodynamic instability undergoing urgent cardioversion (electrical or pharmacologic), After successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm, we suggest therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks after successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm rather than no anticoagulation, regardless of baseline stroke risk (weak recommendation, low quality evidence).</p>
        <p>Remark: Decisions about anticoagulation beyond 4 weeks should be made in accordance with our risk-based recommendations for long-term antithrombotic therapy in recommendations 1 and 2. 19. For patients with atrial flutter undergoing elective or urgent pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion, we suggest that the same approach to thromboprophylaxis be used as for patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing cardioversion (ungraded consensus-based statement). 20. In AF patients presenting with an ACS and/or undergoing PCI/stenting, we recommend assessment of stroke risk using the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score (Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence) Remark: All such patients are not 'low risk' and should be considered for concomitant OAC. 21. In AF patients presenting with an ACS and/or undergoing PCI/stenting, we suggest attention to modifiable bleeding risk factors at every patient contact, and assessment of bleeding risk using the HAS-BLED score (weak recommendation, low quality evidence).</p>
        <p>Remark: Where bleeding risk is high (HAS-BLED ≥3), there should be more regular review and follow-up. 22. In AF patients requiring OAC undergoing elective PCI/stenting, where bleeding risk is low (HAS-BLED 0-2) relative to risk for recurrent ACS and/or stent thrombosis, we suggest triple therapy for 1-3 months, followed by dual therapy with OAC plus single antiplatelet (preferably clopidogrel) until 12 months, following which OAC monotherapy can be used (weak recommendation, low quality evidence). 23. In AF patients requiring OAC undergoing elective PCI/stenting, where bleeding risk is high (HAS-BLED ≥3), we suggest triple therapy for one month, followed by dual therapy with OAC plus single antiplatelet (preferably clopidogrel) for 6 months, following which OAC monotherapy can be used (weak recommendation, low quality evidence) 24. In AF patients requiring OAC undergoing elective PCI/stenting , where bleeding risk is unusually high and thrombotic risk relatively low, we suggest use of OAC plus single antiplatelet (preferably clopidogrel) for 6 months, following which OAC monotherapy can be used (weak recommendation, low quality evidence) Remark: Patients at unusually high bleeding risk may include patients with HAS-BLED ≥3 and recent acute bleeding event. High thrombotic risk may include those with left main stent, multivessel PCI/stenting, etc. 25. In AF patients requiring OAC presenting with an ACS, undergoing PCI/stenting, where bleeding risk is low (HAS-BLED 0-2) relative to risk for ACS or stent thrombosis, we suggest triple therapy for 6 months, followed by dual therapy with OAC plus single antiplatelet (preferably clopidogrel) until 12 months, following which OAC monotherapy can be used (weak recommendation, low quality evidence) 26. In AF patients requiring OAC presenting with an ACS, undergoing PCI/stenting, where bleeding risk is high (HAS-BLED ≥3), we suggest triple therapy for 1-3 months, followed by dual therapy with OAC plus single antiplatelet (preferably clopidogrel) up to 12 months, following which OAC monotherapy can be used (weak recommendation, low quality evidence).</p>
        <p>ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 9 27. In AF patients requiring OAC presenting with an ACS, undergoing PCI/stenting where bleeding risk is unusually high and thrombotic risk low, we suggest OAC plus single antiplatelet (preferably clopidogrel) for 6-9 months, following which OAC monotherapy can be used. (weak recommendation, low quality evidence). Remark: Patients at unusually high bleeding risk may include patients with HAS-BLED ≥3 and recent acute bleeding event. High thrombotic risk may include those with left main stent, multivessel PCI/stenting, etc. 28. In AF patients with ACS or undergoing PCI in whom OAC is recommended, we suggest using VKA with TTR&gt;65-70% (INR range 2.0-3.0), or to use a NOAC at a dose licensed for stroke prevention in AF (weak recommendation, low quality evidence).</p>
        <p>Remark: Only Dabigatran 150mg bid or (not licensed in USA) 110mg bid or Rivaroxaban 15mg qd are currently supported by clinical trial evidence. A NOAC based strategy has lower bleeding risk compared to a VKA-based strategy. 29. In AF patients in which aspirin is concomitantly used with OAC, we suggest a dose of 75-100mg qd with concomitant use of PPI to minimize gastrointestinal bleeding (Weak recommendation, low quality evidence) 30. In AF Patients in which a P2Y12 inhibitor is concomitantly used with OAC, we suggest the use of clopidogrel (Weak recommendation, low quality evidence) Remark: Newer agents (eg. Ticagrelor) can be considered where bleeding risk is low. Data on the combination of ticagrelor with either dabigatran 110mg bid or 150 bid (without concomitant aspirin use) are available from the RE-DUAL PCI trial. 31. For patients with AF and stable coronary artery disease (eg, no acute coronary syndrome within the previous year) and who choose oral anticoagulation, we suggest OAC with either a NOAC or adjusted-dose VKA therapy alone (target international normalized ratio [INR] range, 2.0-3.0) rather than the combination of OAC and aspirin (Weak recommendation, low quality evidence) 32. In patients with AF in whom catheter ablation of AF or implantation of cardiac electronic implantable devices is planned, we suggest performing the procedure on uninterrupted VKA in the INR therapeutic range, dabigatran or rivaroxaban (weak recommendation, low quality evidence).</p>
        <p>ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 11 41. For patients that present with a clinically documented episode of AF (12-lead ECG or other means, eg. external devices with validated rhythm detection), we suggest that the presence or absence of symptoms must not influence the process of decision making with regard to the need for anticoagulation based on risk stratification (ungraded consensus-based statement). 42. In cases of AHRE (atrial high rate episodes) detected by a CIED of at least 5 min duration, we suggest that direct analysis of electrograms corresponding to AHRE is clinically indicated to exclude artifacts or other causes of inappropriate detection of atrial tachyarrhythmias or AF (ungraded consensus-based statement).</p>
        <p>Remark: In patients with CIED detected AHRE a complete cardiological evaluation is indicated, with 12-lead ECG, general assessment of clinical conditions and clinical risk stratification for stroke using CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score.</p>
        <p>Remark: There is no evidence in support or against prescription of oral anticoagulants in patients at risk of stroke (intermediate to high risk according to CHA 2 DS 2 VASc) who present with AHREs, corresponding to atrial tachyarrhythmias/AF at electrograms assessment of less than 24 hours duration. 43. In patients with AF, we suggest prescription of oral anticoagulants as a result of an individualized clinical assessment taking into account overall AHRE burden (in the range of hours rather than minutes) and specifically, the presence of AHRE &gt; 24 hours, individual stroke risk (using CHA 2 DS 2 VASc), predicted risk benefit of oral anticoagulation and informed patient preferences (ungraded consensus-based statement).</p>
        <p>Remark: In patients with CIED detected AHRE continued patient follow-up is recommended, preferentially combining clinical follow up with remote monitoring of the CIED or else more frequent device interrogation than standard for CIED follow-up, to detect the development of clinical AF (symptomatic or asymptomatic), to monitor the evolution of AHRE or AF burden and specifically the transition to AHRE lasting more than 24 hours,onset or worsening of heart failure, or any clinical change that might suggest a change in clinical profile or clinical conditions. 44. For patients with atrial flutter, we suggest that antithrombotic therapy decisions follow the same risk-based recommendations as for AF. (ungraded consensus-based statement). 45. For women receiving OAC for prevention of stroke/TE in AF who become pregnant, we suggest discontinuation of OAC with a VKA between weeks 6 and 12 and replacement by LMWH twice daily (with dose adjustment according to weight and target anti-Xa level 4-6 hours post-dose 0.8-1.2 U/mL), especially in patients with a warfarin dose required of &gt;5 mg/day (or phenprocoumon &gt;3 mg/day or acenocoumarol &gt;2mg/day). OAC should then be discontinued and replaced by adjusted-dose LMWH (target anti-Xa level 4-6 hours post-dose 0.8-1.2 U/mL) in the 36th week of gestation (ungraded consensus-based statement). 46. For women on treatment with long-term vitamin K antagonists who are attempting pregnancy and are candidates for LMWH substitution, we suggest performing frequent pregnancy tests and use LMWH instead of VKA when pregnancy is achieved rather than switching to LMWH while attempting pregnancy (ungraded consensus-based statement). 47. For pregnant women, we suggest avoiding the use of NOACs (ungraded consensus-based statement) .</p>
        <p>Remark: For women on treatment with a NOAC we suggest switching to vitamin K antagonists, rather than switching to LMWH while attempting pregnancy</p>
        <p>ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 12 48. For lactating women using warfarin, acenocoumarol, or UFH who wish to breastfeed, we suggest continuing the use of warfarin, acenocoumarol, LMWH or UFH (ungraded consensusbased statement) 49. For breast-feeding women, we suggest alternative anticoagulants rather than NOACs (ungraded consensus-based statement). 50. For mild CKD (Stage II, CrCl 60-89 ml/min), we suggest that oral anticoagulation clinical decision making and treatment recommendations match that of patients without CKD (weak recommendation, very low quality evidence). 51. For moderate CKD (Stage III, CrCl 30-59 ml/min), we suggest oral anticoagulation in patients with a CHA 2 DS 2 VASc ≥2 with label-adjusted NOACs or dose adjusted vitamin K antagonists (Weak recommendation, very low quality evidence).</p>
        <p>Remark: With VKA, good quality anticoagulation control (TTR&gt;65-70%) is recommended. 52. In severe non-dialysis CKD (Stage IV CrCl 15-30), we suggest using VKAs and selected NOACs (rivaroxaban 15mg QD, apixaban 2.5mg bid, edoxaban 30mg QD and (in USA only) dabigatran 75mg bid) with caution, based on pharmacokinetic data (ungraded consensus-based statement). 53. In end-stage renal disease (CrCl &lt; 15 or dialysis-dependent), we suggest that individualized decision-making is appropriate (ungraded consensus-based statement). 54. In end-stage renal disease (CrCl &lt; 15 or dialysis-dependent , we suggest using well managed VKA with TTR&gt;65-70% (ungraded consensus-based statement).</p>
        <p>Remark: NOACs should generally not be used, although in USA, apixaban 5mg bid is approved for use in AF patients receiving hemodialysis Remark: In patients with CKD who initiate OAC, concomitant antiplatelet therapy including lowdose aspirin is likely to substantially elevate bleeding risk and should be used very judiciously. 55. In patients with AF at high risk of ischaemic stroke who have absolute contraindications for OAC, we suggest using LAA occlusion (Weak recommendation, low quality evidence).</p>
        <p>Remark: When taking into account LAAO as a potential option, the risk of bleeding related to antiplatelets agents that need to be prescribed in the first months has to be considered and the possibility to use NOACs. 56. In AF patients at risk of ischaemic stroke undergoing cardiac surgery, we suggest surgical exclusion of the LAA for stroke prevention, but the need for long term OAC is unchanged (Weak recommendation, low quality evidence). 57. In AF patients taking warfarin without high risk of thromboembolism or who do not have a mechanical valve, we suggest pre-operative management without bridging (Weak recommendation, low quality evidence). 58. In AF patients on antithrombotic prophylaxis with warfarin with a high risk of thromboembolism or with a mechanical valve, we suggest pre-operative management with bridging (Weak recommendation, low quality evidence).</p>
        <p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, with an increasing prevalence and incidence with age. In adults aged &gt;40 years, there is a 1 in 4 lifetime risk of developing AF, with incident AF commonly related to various associated cardiovascular and noncardiovascular risk factors. AF without associated valvular heart disease (so-called 'non-valvular AF') is associated with a five-fold increase in stroke risk (approximately 5%/year), but this risk is dependent on the presence of various stoke risk factors 1 . Many of the risk factors leading to incident AF are also risk factors for ischemic stroke, and the promotion of an integrated or holistic approach to AF management is needed, incorporating stroke prevention, addressing symptoms and risk factor management 2 .</p>
        <p>Stroke prevention is the principal priority in the holistic approach to AF management 1 . Even since the last edition of the ACCP guidelines published in 2012 3 , there have been substantial developments in AF thromboproprophylaxis, whether with regard to risk assessment, antithrombotic drugs or non-drug approaches.</p>
        <p>It is clear that AF should not be considered in isolation, at the stage of detection, prevention or treatment. For example, the majority of deaths in individuals with AF are from cardiac causes, including HF, whereas stroke and bleeding represent a small subset of deaths, yet most interventions focus on stroke prevention 4 . Thus, a more holistic approach is needed to take comorbidities and cross-disease sequelae of AF, bridging primary and secondary care 2 .</p>
        <p>Aside from stroke prevention ('Avoid Stroke, use Anticoagulants), AF management requires patient centered and symptom directed decisions on rate or rhythm control ('Better symptom management') as well as 'Cardiovascular and other risk factor, and lifestyle management' 2 . The latter includes addressing risk factors (cardiac ischemia, heart failure, hypertension, sleep apnea, diabetes, etc.) and lifestyle (obesity, alcohol excess, stimulants etc.). This simple ABC approach (Atrial fibrillation Better Care approach) would simplify an integrated approach to AF management in a holistic manner. (Figure 1) 2</p>
        <p>This guideline focuses on stroke prevention and begins with a brief discussion of the methods used to develop these guidelines and the recommendations for antithrombotic therapy in patients with AF. Next, we provide our treatment recommendations, divided into the following sections:</p>
        <p>• Stroke and bleeding risk assessment The article ends with a discussion of practical and patient-centered issues as well as suggestions for future research.</p>
        <p>The chair of the panel (G.Y.H.L.) was appointed and subsequently reviewed and approved by CHEST's Professional Standards Committee (PSC). Panelists were nominated by the chair based on their expertise relative to potential guideline questions.</p>
        <p>All panel nominees were reviewed for their potential conflicts of interest (COI) by CHEST's PSC. After review, nominees who were found to have no substantial COIs were approved, whereas nominees with potential intellectual and financial COIs that were manageable were "approved with management". Panelists approved with management were prohibited from participating in discussions or voting on recommendations in which they had substantial COIs. A grid was created listing panelists' COIs for each recommendation for use during voting. Of note, the chair (G.Y.H.L.) recused himself from any voting on recommendations. The COI grid can be found in e-Table 1.</p>
        <p>Table 1 specifies the clinical questions being addressed in this article (in PICO [population, intervention, comparator, outcomes] format) and the types of studies included.</p>
        <p>studies. 6 In cases in which existing systematic reviews were available, we used the Documentation and Appraisal Review Tool to assess methodological quality. 7</p>
        <p>When individual studies were available or an existing meta-analysis needed to be updated, we used the 
            <rs type="creator">Cochrane Collaboration</rs>
            <rs type="software">Review Manager</rs>, version 
            <rs type="version">5.2 8</rs> to pool the results across individual studies. We used a random-effects model and the method of DerSimonian and Laird to pool the individual estimates. 9 Relative risk (RR) was used to report the results for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with accompanying 95% confidence intervals (CI). Statistical heterogeneity of the pooled results was assessed using the Higgins' I 2 and the Chisquare tests. A Higgins'I 2 value of ≥50% or Chi-square p&lt;0.05 was considered to represent significant heterogeneity.
        </p>
        <p>The overall certainty (quality) of the evidence was assessed for each critical or important outcome of interest using the GRADE approach. 10 Evidence profiles were created using the Guideline Development Tool (GDT), which categorized the overall quality of the body of evidence into one of four levels: high, moderate, low, or very low.</p>
        <p>The panel drafted and graded recommendations based on the results of the meta-analyses and evidence profiles. Recommendations were graded according to CHEST's grading system which uses the GRADE approach (Table 2). 11,12 The recommendations were either "strong" or "weak" according to this approach. Strong recommendations use the wording "we recommend" and weak recommendations use the wording "we suggest". The implications of the strength of recommendation are summarized in e-Table 2.</p>
        <p>In instances in which there was insufficient evidence, but a clinically relevant area was felt to require a guiding comment, a weak suggestion was developed and "Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement" replaced the grade. 13 In developing our treatment recommendations, we attempted to account for patient values and preferences regarding these outcomes, and had two patient advocates (MTH and DAL) who participated in the panel discussion, and specifically addressed patient-centered issues.</p>
        <p>All drafted recommendations and suggestions were presented to the panel in an anonymous online voting survey to reach consensus and gather feedback. Panelists were requested to indicate their level of agreement on each statement based on a five-point Likert scale derived from the GRADE grid. 14 Panelists with COIs related to the individual recommendations recused themselves from voting on those statements). Of note, the chair (G.Y.H.L.) recused himself from any voting on recommendations. According to CHEST policy, each recommendation and statement required a 75%</p>
        <p>A comparison of features included in various published stroke risk stratification schemes in AF is shown in e-Table 6. A summary of studies comparing the various stroke risk stratification schema is available in e-Table 7. The risk stratification scheme commonly used in many guidelines is the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years [doubled], diabetes, stroke/transient ischemic attack/thromboembolism [doubled], vascular disease [prior myocardial infarction (MI), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), or aortic plaque], age 65-74 years, sex category [female]) score 1 .</p>
        <p>All risk schemes based on clinical risk factors have broadly similar predictive value for 'high risk' patients who sustain stroke and TE events (all c-indexes approx. 0.60-0.65). Adding more and more clinical variables and complexity (i.e., simple versus more complex clinical risk scores) would only modestly increase the c-index to approximately 0.65-0.70. Many score comparisons focus on identification of 'high risk' and do not focus on 'low risk end of the spectrum' and so are not helpful for decision-making on whether to anticoagulate or not. Event rates per score point varies according to study setting, ethnicity, cohort, and community vs. hospitalized population etc (as might be expected) 61 . Also, reported events depends on use of highly selected clinical trial cohort vs. 'real world' unselected, and anticoagulated vs. non-anticoagulated patients 62 . Mortality rates from observational cohorts may also include fatal strokes as postmortems are not mandated, outcomes are non-adjudicated (as in clinical trials) and cerebral imaging is not performed. Analytical methodology matters and outcomes depend on thresholds for treatment, varying risk profile during the study (which this does not remain static) and statistical analysis methods 63 . Some analyses which exclude patients on anticoagulants are flawed by 'conditioning on the future' methodology, and follow-up can be dependent on continuation in a (US) healthcare plan. Ethnic differences are also evident in stroke risk related to AF. In a Taiwanese cohort, the risk of stroke was 1.78%/year in patients aged 50-64 years and a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc 0. 64 The risk exceeds the threshold for OAC use for stroke prevention. A modified CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc (mCHA 2 DS 2 -VASc) score has been proposed, assigning one point for patients aged 50 to 74 years. 65 The mCHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score performed better than CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score in predicting ischemic stroke assessed by C indexes and net reclassification index. For patients having an mCHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of 1 (males) or 2 (females) because of the resetting of the age threshold, use of warfarin was associated with a 30% lower risk of ischemic stroke and a similar risk of ICH compared with no-treatment. Net clinical benefit analyses also favored the use of warfarin in different weighted models. These findings suggest that the agebased treatment threshold for stroke prevention may need to be reset in East Asians. 65 Adding biomarkers would (statistically) improve prediction but c-indexes are still approximately 0.65-0.70. Recent studies in real world cohorts do not support the clinical usefulness of biomarkerbased scores over clinical risk scores such as the CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score. The use of biomarkers have to balance the assay availability, lab variability, costs and added complexity and lower practicality for everyday use. Also, many biomarker studies are based on anticoagulated highly selected clinical</p>
        <p>21 trial cohorts, with all included subjects already in the high risk group (CHA 2 DS 2 VASc or CHADS 2 score of 2 or greater). There are few/no studies on non-anticoagulated AF patients, to ascertain the true impact of biomarkers on (non-anticoagulation treated) stroke rates. Current studies do not inform whether the biomarkers will discriminate/identify low risk in lower/intermediate risk patients who are not anticoagulated. Rather than focus on identifying 'high risk', the focus should be on initially identifying 'low risk' patients. A 'low risk' categorization by the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc (0 in males and 1 in females) consistently identifies low risk patients, with event rates around 1%/year or under, notwithstanding the possible need to re-categorize the age 65-74 criterion in Asians 65 .</p>
        <p>The majority of published studies and systematic reviews suggest that the CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score is generally better than CHADS 2 , ATRIA and CHADS65 in identifying 'low risk' patients, although the proportion of the population assigned as low risk is small. However, there are conflicting data in different cohorts for performance of the ATRIA score (UK CPRD and Swedish cohorts vs Danish and Taiwan cohorts). Differences between the ATRIA and CHA 2 DS 2 VASc disappear when cut-points are optimized for stroke risk of the cohort. There are discrepancies between individual studies on the relative performance of ATRIA and CHA 2 DS 2 VASc scores in identifying low risk patients, but the CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score is easier to calculate. Rather than using risk scores in a categorical manner -recognizing the various limitations of scores to predict 'high risk' patients that sustain events -and given that for each risk strata or given risk score point, we recognized there is wide variation in reported event rates based on reported study clinical setting, patient population, ethnicity etc. Notwithstanding that the default should be stroke prevention for all AF patients unless deemed to be 'low risk', the focus should be to use scores to initially identify 'low risk' patients who do not need antithrombotic therapy, rather than focus on identification of 'high risk' patients. Prior guidelines have also opted for the CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score to define a low risk group. The 'C' in CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc refers to recent decompensated heart failure, irrespective of the ejection fraction (thus including heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) or preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)) or the presence of moderate-severe LV systolic impairment on cardiac imaging, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic. The 'H' refers to history of hypertension or uncontrolled blood pressure, while 'S' refers to stroke, systemic embolism or a confirmed diagnosis of transient ischemic attack (TIA). 'V' refers to complicated vascular disease, including myocardial infarction or peripheral artery disease, or if performed, the presence of complex aortic plaque on TEE. Female sex (Sc criterion) is only relevant as a risk modifier if age&gt;65 or additional associated risk factors are present, given that at females age &lt;65 with no other risk factors are not at excess stroke risk 66 . Stroke risk is also dynamic, and risk should be re-assessed at every patient contact. This was seen in a study where the 'delta CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score', representing the change in stroke risk between between baseline and followup) was the best predictor for ischaemic stroke 67 .</p>
        <p>A stepwise approach to thromboprophylaxis would allow initial identification of low risk using CHA 2 DS 2 VASc (Step 1), following which stroke prevention can be offered to all others (Step 2)</p>
        <p>irrespective of stroke point score or biomarkers used. This would approach uses stroke risk scores in a reductionist manner to aid decision-making, and balances simplicity and practicality (and costs).</p>
        <p>The rates of major bleeding on VKA among observational cohorts are shown in e-Table 8 and demonstrate highly variable rates, ranging from 1.4%/year 68,69 to 10.4%/year. 70 Nevertheless, there is significant heterogeneity between the study population characteristics, the inclusion of inception versus 'experienced' OAC cohorts, significant disparity in the exposure period (follow-up) and differences in the definitions of major bleeding employed. In addition, information on the specific risks of bleeding of the individual cohorts, using a validated bleeding risk score are lacking, the definitions of major bleeding were often not provided and the quality of anticoagulation, such as TTR, is generally lacking. Therefore, direct comparison of the rates of major bleeding on VKA between observational cohorts and with RCTs is problematic.</p>
        <p>The definitions of major bleeding are available in most clinical trials, especially in the NOACs trials where ISTH definitions were used. 71 Before the NOAC era, the rates of major bleeding due to VKA were generally in the range of 1% to 3% per year (e-Table 9). In the 5 NOAC trials, [72][73][74][75][76] the annual</p>
        <p>rates of major bleeding of warfarin were between 3% to 4% (Table 2). Data from NOACs trials are more reliable, because patients were randomized to treatment, the majority were double-blinded and the quality of anticoagulation (such as TTR) was generally better than observational studies. The risk of major bleeding on NOACs, especially the low-dose regimen (dabigatran 110 mg and edoxaban 30 mg), was generally lower than that on warfarin, except in the ROCKET AF trial. 73 Risk factors for bleeding with NOAC, VKA and antiplatelet therapy Numerous risk factors for bleeding among AF patients receiving antithrombotic therapy have been identified and incorporated into bleeding risk scores (see Section on Bleeding Risk Score). Bleeding risk varies from person to person depending on their pre-existing comorbidities, current antithrombotic regimen and adherence, concomitant medication, and lifestyle choices. Many of these factors cannot be altered but some are modifiable or potentially modifiable (see Figure 2). In order to reduce antithrombotic-treatment associated bleeding it is important to recognize that bleeding risk is also dynamic and should be reassessed at every patient review. While modifiable bleeding risk factors that can be changed or managed should clearly be addressed as part of a holistic approach to AF patient assessment and management, non-modifiable bleeding risks are important drivers of bleeding events when occurring synergistically with modifiable ones 77 . An approach to bleeding risk assessment soley based only on modifiable bleeding risk factors is an inferior assessment strategy compared to use of a formal bleeding risk score [78][79][80] .</p>
        <p>Good control of blood pressure is vital to reduce the risk of stroke and is essential to decrease the risk of bleeding on antithrombotic therapy; adherence to current guidelines on the management of hypertension should be followed.</p>
        <p>Among patients receiving VKA, maintenance of an INR in the therapeutic range (2.0-3.0) is essential. The proportion of time spent in this range (TTR) should be at least 65% but the ultimate aim/target should be 100% (see Optimal INR target range section). The risk of bleeding increases when the INR exceeds 3.0, particularly for ICH risk when INR &gt;3.5. [81][82][83][84][85][86] .</p>
        <p>INR control can potentially be improved by more frequent monitoring and review of factors influencing INR control (diet-, alcohol-, and drug-interactions). There is evidence that improving patient education about INR control, 87 INR management by dedicated anticoagulation clinics with experienced personnel, [88][89][90] and self-monitoring/self-management in selected patients 91 can increase TTR. Increasing patient's awareness of the importance of OAC medication adherence and the potential bleeding risks associated with over-dose are also essential to minimize bleeding complications.</p>
        <p>Non-essential use of concomitant anti-platelet drugs and NSAIDs should be avoided since these medications increase the risk of bleeding in patients receiving OAC. Where concomitant antiplatelet therapy is necessary (i.e. post-coronary stent implantation), the duration of combination OAC and anti-platelet drugs should be kept to the minimum. 92 Since anti-platelet drugs/NSAIDs are</p>
        <p>widely available over-the-counter, patients need to be made aware of the bleeding risk associated with their use in combination with OAC.</p>
        <p>Excessive alcohol intake (chronic or binge-drinking) increases the risk of bleeding predominantly due to the risk of trauma, but in chronic alcohol abuse through poor medication adherence, hepatic and variceal disease. OAC should not initiated among patients consuming alcohol in excess &gt;14U/week. There is no clear definite threshold where bleeding risk is increased. Patients also need to be made aware of the potential dangers associated with excessive alcohol consumption in combination with OAC/antithrombotic therapy.</p>
        <p>Avoidance of work and/or leisure activities that have the potential to cause serious trauma (e.g. contact sports, rock-climbing, occupations working at height or operating heavy machinery) should be advised.</p>
        <p>Interruption of OAC should be avoided to reduce stroke risk since the majority of cardiovascular procedures (e.g., pacemaker implantation or percutaneous coronary intervention) can be safely performed on OAC. Bridging (that is, stopping OAC and providing anticoagulation cover with heparin) should be used in patients with mechanical heart valves but does not appear to be otherwise advantageous. 93,94 .</p>
        <p>Choice of OAC should be made on an individual basis after stroke and bleeding risk assessment and discussion with the patient. Before a NOAC is initiated, the patient's age, body weight and renal function should be considered to allow for appropriate dose adaptation where necessary.</p>
        <p>In frail patients and those at high risk of falls an individual risk assessment needs to be undertaken prior to OAC initiation. In cases where the risk is that of mechanical falls, strategies to improve walking/reduce risk of tripping should be explored (i.e. walking aids, appropriate footwear, home review to remove trip hazards), whereas neurological assessment is warranted if falls are unexplained. The benefits of ischaemic stroke reduction generally outweigh the risk of harm from serious bleeding with OAC use; one estimate was that the patient would need to fall 295 times per year for the risk from falls to outweigh the benefits of stroke reduction 95 . In patients with cognitive impairment or dementia, OAC should only be withheld if there is no available caregiver who can guarantee medication adherence.</p>
        <p>Patients with anemia or reduced platelet count or function should be treated where possible to improve their Hb or platelet count. Causes of renal impairment should be investigated and where possible reversed.</p>
        <p>Patients with liver function abnormalities were generally excluded from the randomised trials, and especially where there is abnormal clotting tests, such patients may be at higher risk of bleeding on VKA, possibly less so on NOACs; in cirrhotic patients, ischaemic stroke reduction may outweigh bleeding risk 96,97 .</p>
        <p>Since 2006, six risk scores have been developed and validated for the assessment of bleeding risk in AF populations. [98][99][100][101][102][103] The number of risk factors included in the bleeding risk schemas varies considerably, from three 101 to 12 103 and the score or weighting associated with each risk factor also differs (see Table 2).</p>
        <p>Age and prior bleeding are included as risk factors in all six bleeding risk scores but different age cutoffs are utilized, with three scores employing age 75 years or older 99,100,102 to indicate greater bleeding risk. Following age and prior bleeding, the most prevalent bleeding risk factors included in the scores are anemia, [99][100][101][102][103] renal disease, [98][99][100]102 hypertension 99,103 or uncontrolled systolic blood pressure, 98 concomitant anti-platelets, 98,102,103 and alcohol excess, 98,100,103 and prior stroke 98,100 or hepatic disease. 98,100 A variety of other risk factors including cancer, 103 labile INR, 98 genetic factors, 100 falls risks, 100 female sex, 103 diabetes mellitus, 103 and biomarkers 101 are included only in one bleeding risk score. For a comprehensive review of bleeding risk factors in AF patients see Zulkifly et al. 104 The bleeding risk scores range in the simplicity of calculation and the cut-offs employed to indicate low, intermediate and high-risk of bleeding, and the prevalence of bleeding events reported in the validation cohorts (see Table 2).</p>
        <p>As seen in Table 2 above, there are multiple bleeding risk scores that have been proposed for bleeding risk stratification, with the HEMORR 2 HAGES, HAS-BLED, ATRIA, ORBIT and ABC-bleeding derived and validated in AF populations 104 . The risk factors included vary by scores [Table 2], and their derivation from selected clinical trial cohorts or 'real world' populations 104 . Various validation studies have been summarized in e-Table 10.</p>
        <p>Unsurprisingly, stroke risk scores are also associated with bleeding, as stroke and bleeding risks correlate with each other. For example, higher CHADS 2 and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scores are also associated with greater bleeding risk, but the HAS-BLED score outperforms the CHADS 2 and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scores for predicting serious bleeding 105,106 , which was also evident in the systematic review by Zhu et al 107 . Composite risk scores that include stroke and bleeding endpoints have also been proposed but have not been shown to perform incrementally better over the individual scores 108,109 . The bleeding risk scores in AF are also predictive of bleeding in non-AF populations, for example, in patients with ACS undergoing PCI-stenting 110 .</p>
        <p>Adding more clinical variables marginally improves the predictive value (at least statistically) but the c-indexes still remain approx. 0.6. The addition of biomarkers would all improve the c-indexes (to approx. 0.65) over scores based on clinical risk factors alone. Many of these risk scores have been derived from highly selected clinical trial cohorts, and biomarkers measured at baseline (or within a few months of study entry) then endpoints determined many years later. Biomarkers are also expensive, and may be subject to laboratory variability, inter-assay differences, diurnal variation and may change in individual patients depending on how risk factors and drug treatments change over time. Many biomarkers (e.g. troponin, natriuretic peptides, inflammatory markers, coagulation markers, etc.) are also predictive of stroke, bleeding, death, heart failure, hospitalization 111 and even non-cardiovascular conditions such as (for example, as in the case of GDF-15 used in the ABC-bleed score) glaucoma progression 112 . The performance of biomarker-based scores in real world clinical practice (outside highly selected trial cohorts) has also been disappointing 113,114 , given that baseline (or near-baseline) determination of biomarkers to predict bleeding risks after many years is bedeviled by the changing clinical risk profile of patient's risks as well as modification of risk factors.</p>
        <p>Given that modifiable bleeding risk factors should be addressed in all patients, the appropriate and responsible way to use a clinical risk score is to identify those patients at particularly high risk, for appropriate early review and follow-up (e.g. in 4 weeks, rather than 4-6 months) -and depending on the outcome of interest, to address the associated modifiable risk factors accordingly [Figure 2]. A high bleeding risk score is not a reason to withhold OAC, as the net clinical benefit is even greater in those patients with high bleeding risk.</p>
        <p>While bleeding risk is highly dynamic and depends on many potentially modifiable bleeding risk factors 115 , simply focusing on bleeding risk assessment using modifiable bleeding risk factors alone is an inferior strategy compared to using a validated bleeding risk score which has been designed to formally assess bleeding score [78][79][80] .</p>
        <p>A comparison of the different bleeding risk scores has been addressed in 2 systematic reviews and the studies are summarized in e-Table 10. As with stroke risk scores, most bleeding risk scores based on simple clinical risk factors only have modest predictive value for identifying the high risk patients that sustain events (c-indexes approx. 0.6).</p>
        <p>The systematic review by Caldera et al 116 reported that the sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were respectively 0. 11). Zhu et al 107 concluded that the HAS-BLED score performed better than the HEMORR 2 HAGES and ATRIA bleeding scores, but was superior to the CHADS 2 and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke scores for bleeding prediction. In a real world AF cohort, there was no long term advantage of the ABC-bleeding score over the HAS-BLED score, for predicting bleeding; in contrast, HAS-BLED was better in identifying those patients at low risk of bleeding 114 .</p>
        <p>Given that the patient pathway may include AF patients initially on no antithrombotic therapy, aspirin or anticoagulants, and the latter can include VKA or NOACs, a bleeding risk score needs to be applicable throughout the patient pathway. The HAS-BLED score has been validated in AF patients from clinical trial and non-trial cohorts, whether on no antithrombotic therapy, aspirin or anticoagulants, VKA or non-VKA anticoagulants, and is predictive of bleeding in AF and non-AF cohorts, and in different ethnic groups 115,117,118 . It is also the only bleeding score predictive of intracranial bleeding 119 .</p>
        <p>The HAS-BLED score has also been shown to be similar or out-perform older bleeding scores, as well as more simple bleeding scores that include less clinical parameters. Amongst VKA-treated patients, the non-consideration of TTR would also mean that the HEMORR 2 HAGES, ORBIT and ATRIA scores would all perform sub-optimally in VKA-treated patients 120,121 . Finally, bleeding risk assessment is dynamic, and should be formally reassessed and recorded at every patient contact. Indeed, followup HAS-BLED or 'delta HAS-BLED score' was more predictive of major bleeding compared with baseline HAS-BLED or the simple determination of 'modifiable bleeding risk factors 77 .</p>
        <p>The principal goal of OAC in AF is to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism, while minimizing the incremental bleeding risk associated with OAC. Although these outcomes may be in part mechanistically related to lower risk of bleeding and ischemic stroke compared to therapies in the control arms, cardiovascular composite or survival outcomes presently do not reflect the primary rationale for therapy.</p>
        <p>In a meta-analysis of 2900 subjects from six randomized trials, adjusted-dose warfarin was associated with a 64% relative risk reduction in stroke (95% CI, 49%-74%) (e-Table 12). The absolute risk reduction was 2.7%/year (from 4.5%/year in controls) in primary prevention subjects and 8.4%/year (from 12%/year in controls) in secondary prevention subjects. 122 Aspirin and antiplatelet therapy compared to placebo or control</p>
        <p>In a meta-analysis of 8 trials of 4876 subjects, antiplatelet therapy compared to control or placebo was associated with a 22% (95% CI 6-35%) relative risk reduction in stroke (e-Table 13). 122 The Stroke Prevention in AF (SPAF-I) study demonstrated decrease in risk of stroke from 6.3%/year in placebo subjects to 3.6%/year (95% CI 9-63%) 123 , but a meta-analysis of 7 trials of 3990 subjects found no significant benefit. SPAF-I was the only trial suggestive of a benefit for aspirin compared to placebo, but there was internal heterogeneity between the anticoagulation-eligible and</p>
        <p>anticoagulation-ineligible subgroups, and given the trial was stopped early, the effect size could have been exaggerated. Aspirin also showed no benefit in the elderly, or in preventing severe strokes. All these trials had significant heterogeneity in study design, variability in aspirin dose tested, short follow-up, and predated contemporary use of oral anticoagulation in AF. The ACTIVE-A trial, which also predated the investigation of NOACs, compared aspirin plus clopidogrel versus aspirin monotherapy among patients in whom VKA was unsuitable. 124 The study found a decrease in risk of stroke with dual antiplatelet therapy, but the major bleeding rates with aspirin-clopidogrel were comparable to rates seen with warfarin (approx. 2%/year).</p>
        <p>Of 12 studies comparing warfarin to antiplatelet therapy, warfarin was associated with a 39% relative risk reduction (95% CI, 22%-52%) in strokes (e-Table 14). 122 In ACTIVE-W, the largest of these studies, warfarin was superior to dual antiplatelet therapy to warfarin for stroke and a cardiovascular composite outcome, with similar rates of major bleeding. 125 Non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs) compared to vitamin K antagonists Several NOACs that directly inhibit thrombin (factor IIa) or activated factor X (factor Xa) have been approved as alternatives to VKAs for stroke prevention in AF. They differ from VKAs in that they have a rapid onset/offset of action, absence of an effect of dietary vitamin K intake on their activity and fewer drug interactions. The predictable anticoagulant effects of the NOACs enable their administration in fixed doses without the need for routine coagulation monitoring, thereby simplifying therapy. Individually in their respective phase 3 trials (Table 3), dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban have been shown to be at least as safe and effective as warfarin for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in patients with AF. 73,74,76,126 A meta-analysis of the four phase 3 trials compared patients taking NOACs (higher-dose) (n=42,411) with warfarin (n=29,272) (e-Table 15). 127 NOACs significantly reduced stroke or systemic embolic events by 19% compared with warfarin (RR 0. Apixaban is the only NOAC that has been compared with aspirin in AF patients. The Apixaban vs. Acetylsalicyclic Acid to Prevent Strokes (AVERROES) trial compared apixaban 5 mg twice daily with aspirin in AF patients who were not candidates for VKA therapy. 128 The trial was stopped early for benefit as apixaban significantly reduced the risk of stroke or systemic embolism compared with aspirin (hazard ratio 0.45, 95% CI 0.32-0.62; p&lt;0.001) (e-Table 16). There was no significant difference in major bleeding (hazard ratio 1.13, 95% CI 0.74-1.75; p=0.57) between apixaban and aspirin.</p>
        <p>With the availability of large health care system administrative data and the advent of quality improvement and post-marketing anticoagulation registries, the number of observational outcome studies on OAC in AF far outnumber randomized trials. Although these data have helped to successfully identify treatment variation and gaps in care, the use of these data for comparative effectiveness and safety studies of OACs must be interpreted with prudence. Despite the use of sophisticated, high-quality methods to minimize confounding and bias and improve causal inference, even very small amounts of residual confounding by treatment selection or measurement error can attenuate or amplify the small absolute risk differences observed in the randomized trials. Similarly, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn from indirect comparisons such as network metaanalysess of NOACs to each other due to small absolute risk differences. Real-world or observational data are generally insufficient to guide selection of individual anticoagulant drugs. Therefore, observational data are best used to reaffirm that real-world effectiveness is in concordance with clinical trial efficacy, based on both quality of care and generalizability. 129 2016 A meta-analysis of real-world observational studies of dabigatran was consistent with findings from RE-LY. Compared to VKA, risk of stroke with dabigatran versus warfarin was 1.65 vs. 2.85 per 100 patients-years (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.74-0.99). 130 Dabigatran was also associated with a lower risk of intracranial bleeding (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.38-0.52) and lower risk of death (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61-0.87). Risk of gastrointestinal bleeding was higher. One systematic review and meta-analysis provided comparative effectiveness and safety data for rivaroxaban vs. dabigatran (n=3 trials), rivaroxaban vs. warfarin (n=11 trials) or both (n=3 trials) for stroke prevention in AF 131 . Overall, the risk of stroke/systemic thromboembolism (TE) with rivaroxaban were similar compared with dabigatran, but were significantly reduced when compared to warfarin (HR 0.75, 0.64-0.85). Major bleeding risk was significantly higher with rivaroxaban vs. dabigatran (HR 1.38, 1.27-1.49), but similar to warfarin (HR 0.99, 0.91-1.07). Rivaroxaban was associated with increased all-cause mortality and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), but similar risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) compared with dabigatran. When compared with warfarin, rivaroxaban was associated with similar risk of any bleeding, mortality and AMI, but a higher risk of GIB and lower risk of ICH.</p>
        <p>35 Another large analysis of three Danish nationwide databases of 61,678 patients found that NOACs were at least as safe and effective as warfarin, with small but significant differences in risk of stroke, death, and bleeding across rivaroxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran. 132 However, a new-user FDA Medicare analysis of 118,891 patients found that rivaroxaban compared to dabigatran had a statistical trend towards a decreased risk of stroke (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.65-1.01) and significantly increased risk of intracranial (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.32-1.67) and major non-intracranial bleeding (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.32-1.67). 133 Absolute risk differences were small (2.0-2.1 per 1000 person-years) and well within a range vulnerable to confounding. Different Ethnic Groups Asian AF patients have a higher risk of intracranial hemorrhage compared with Caucasians when VKAs are used. 134 The higher risk of bleeding on VKA in Asians vs. non-Asians has also been observed in major clinical trials of NOACs, 135 even though Asians received a lower intensity of anticoagulation with VKA. 136 In a recent meta-analysis comprising 5 NOAC trials (RE-LY, ROCKET AF, J-ROCKET AF, ARISTOTLE, and ENGAGE AF), the effects of NOACs versus warfarin in Asians vs non-Asians were compared. 137 For standard-dose NOACs (dabigatran 150 mg, rivaroxaban 20 mg, apixaban 5 mg, and edoxaban 60 mg), the effect sizes of the primary efficacy endpoint (stroke and SE) and the primary safety endpoint (major bleeding) were greater in Asians versus non-Asians. The risk reduction in hemorrhagic stroke and GI bleeding was also greater in Asians vs. non-Asians. These data suggest that standard-dose NOACs, when compared with warfarin, were more effective and safer in Asians than in non-Asians. The efficacy and safety of low-dose NOACs (dabigatran 110 mg, rivaroxaban 15 mg, and edoxaban 30 mg), when compared with warfarin, appears similar among Asians and non-Asians. There are several real-world studies from Asia comparing NOACs with warfarin 138,139 . Despite lowdose NOACs, such as dabigatran 110 mg or rivaroxaban 15 mg/10 mg being more commonly used than standard-dose NOACs (dabigatran 150 mg or rivaroxaban 20 mg), the use of NOACs were associated with reduced risk of ischemic stroke or systemic embolization, major bleeding, ICH, and total mortality compared with warfarin. Published data suggest that NOACs are preferentially indicated for stroke prevention in Asians. 37</p>
        <p>Although NOACs are safer than VKAs, serious bleeding still occurs. The potential for bleeding often discourages initiation of anticoagulant therapy in patients deemed to be at high risk of bleeding and patients who experience a bleed frequently have permanent or prolonged discontinuation of their anticoagulant. Therefore, continued interest remains in developing even safer anticoagulants than thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors. Current investigation has focused on the upstream targets factor XI and factor XII in the contact pathway as emerging research has elucidated their critical role in thrombosis with minimal or no role in hemostasis. [140][141][142] Strategies to target FXII or FXI include antisense oligonucleotides that reduce hepatic synthesis of the clotting proteins, monoclonal antibodies that block activation or activity, aptamers, small molecules that block the active site or</p>
        <p>induce allosteric modulation, and polyanion antagonists that attenuate contact activation by nullifying stimulators of the pathway. 7 Human data are limited. The factor XI-directed antisense oligonucleotide IONIS-416858 was compared with enoxaparin in 300 patients undergoing elective knee arthroplasty. Patients were randomized to IONIS-416858 at doses of 200 or 300 mg starting 35 days prior to surgery, or enoxaparin at a dose of 40 mg starting after the surgery. The 200 mg IONIS-416858 regimen was non-inferior and the 300 mg IONIS-416858 regimen was superior compared with enoxaparin in preventing the composite endpoint of asymptomatic deep venous thrombosis (DVT), symptomatic DVT or pulmonary embolism, or venous thromboembolism related mortality. 143 The rates of major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding were 3% in both IONIS-416858 groups and 8% in the enoxaparin group. With respect to patients with AF, potential unmet needs addressed by these agents include patients at high risk for bleeding, such as those with end stage renal disease who are on hemodialysis (phase 2 study ongoing https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02553889. Another area of interest is in patients with mechanical heart valves. Data from a phase II trial of dabigatran in patients with mechanical heart valves (RE-ALIGN) demonstrated inferior efficacy and more bleeding, compared to warfarin. 144</p>
        <p>The vitamin K antagonists (VKA) are a class of oral anticoagulants; the most commonly used are the 4-hydroxycoumarins, and include warfarin, phenprocoumon and acenocoumarol. 145 Less commonly used VKAs are phenindione and fluindione which are 1,3-indandione derivatives. Geographical variation in VKA popularity is evident, with warfarin commonly used worldwide, but acenocoumarol being popular in Spain and phenprocoumon in Germany. In randomized clinical trials, most have used warfarin.</p>
        <p>For stroke prevention in patients with AF receiving a VKA the optimal INR target range is 2.0 to 3.0, 146 aiming for an INR value of 2.5 to maximize the proportion of time spent in the therapeutic INR range. Numerous observational studies of AF patients have demonstrated that the risk of thromboembolism/ischemic stroke is greater when INR is &lt;2.0 81,83,85,[147][148][149] whereas INR levels &gt;3.0 are associated with a greater incidence of major bleeding, especially intracranial hemorrhage when the INR rises above 3.5. [81][82][83][84][85][86] All the phase III NOAC trials employed an INR target of 2.0-3.0 among patients receiving warfarin; 73,76,126,128 154,155 they are not equivalent and should not be used interchangeably. TTR is a widely accepted and validated measure of anticoagulation control and predicts adverse events in patients receiving VKA [155][156][157] and is the quality and performance measure of choice for specialized anticoagulation clinics. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the risk of thromboembolism, major bleeding, and death is lower when the proportion of TTR is higher, at least ≥65%. 127,[155][156][157] Indeed, random 'one off' INR values give little insight into the degree of anticoagulation control, and many adverse outcomes (e.g., bleeding) occur even within the therapeutic INR range of 2.0-3.0. 158 Thus, when VKAs are used attention should be focused on the average individual TTR as a measure of the quality of anticoagulation control. Clinical guidelines on the management of AF advocate an individual TTR of at least ≥65% 159,160 to maximize efficacy and safety and this should be the treatment target, although in clinical practice this may be more difficult to achieve. [155][156][157][158]161 90,163,164 distant to OAC clinic, 163,164 self-monitoring/selfmanagement, 91 frequency of INR monitoring etc. 158 It is also important to note that site level variation in VKA management has also been demonstrated in RCTs [165][166][167][168][169] and for NOACs. 170 The value of dietary measures to improve anticoagulation control is debatable, and it is perhaps more relevant to maintain a stable dietary habit, avoiding wide changes in the intake of vitamin K 171 . Amongst patients initiating VKA, the 'Time to achieve Therapeutic Range' (TtTR) has also been related to the likelihood of achieving a subsequently good Time in Therapeutic Range (TTR) 172,173 .</p>
        <p>The more common clinical factors influencing TTR have been used to formulate the SAMe-TT 2 R 2 score 174,175 (Table 5). The SAMe-TT 2 R 2 score has been assessed in 15 exclusively AF cohorts, [176][177][178][179][180][181][182][183][184][185][186][187] with six 177,179,181,182,185,188 reporting its predictive ability to forecast good or poor anticoagulation control, with c-statistics ranging from 0.56 182 to 0.72. 174 However, these cohorts were predominantly elderly, Western (white) populations and its predictive ability in non-Western populations has relatively limited data as only three studies have assessed it, 176,177 , with only one reporting c-statistics (c-statistic 0.54, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.57). 177 In the multi-ethnic non-Caucasian Singaporean population by Bernaitis et al 176 the SAMe-TT 2 R 2 score was able to dichotomize the patients likely to do well on VKA, compared to those (score &gt;2) more likely to achieve poor TTR. In the Loire Valley AF project, the SAMe-TT 2 R 2 score was predictive of labile INR in AF patients who were VKA users, and was significantly associated with the adverse consequences of labile INR, including stroke, serious bleeding and death; the score was non-predictive in non-VKA users 189 . The score has also been tested in some VTE populations, where it similarly identifies patients likely to achieve a good TTR. 190,191 Acronym</p>
        <p>Patients with AF who require OAC should not have to fail with a VKA before they are offered a NOAC; the most appropriate OAC based on the patient's individual risk profile and patient preference, should be offered from the beginning of OAC therapy. However, in some healthcare systems where the patient has to have a period on VKA and their TTR determined, before a decision to use a NOAC is approved, the SAMe-TT 2 R 2 score could be used to aid decision-making 175</p>
        <p>There is an increasing demand for oral anticoagulation among AF patients 192 and not all patients are suitable for NOACs, therefore a large proportion requires VKA which necessitates INR monitoring. Point-of-care (POC) testing using a coagulometer (INR monitor) is more convenient and timeefficient, particularly where patient's self-monitor and/or self-manage. Home or clinic POC monitoring is an increasingly standard method of INR monitoring associated with an appropriate degree of precision and accuracy for clinical practice, 193 however routine calibration is warranted and quality control systems should adhere with the FDA Medical devices regulation guidance 194 .</p>
        <p>A recent Cochrane review 91 evaluating the effect of self-monitoring or self-management of OAC therapy compared to standard OAC monitoring on thromboembolic events, major bleeding and death revealed a significant decrease in thromboembolic events overall (RR 0. The advantages of self-monitoring and self-management include convenience and freedom for the patient, patient empowerment/control over their condition and treatment, increased patient satisfaction, all of which may improve quality of life. However, this approach may not be a viable option for all patients requiring VKA therapy as it is initially expensive, requires mastery of the point-</p>
        <p>of-care device and for those self-managing, the knowledge and ability to dose-adjust, plus the appropriate healthcare system infrastructure and patient support which may not be feasible globally. For many AF patients, a NOAC might be a more suitable alternative.</p>
        <p>The approach to stroke prevention in patients with AF can be simplified into a simple 3-step algorithm (Figure 4). The initial step is to determine the risk of stroke. As noted in the Stroke Risk section, risk scores for stroke in patients with AF lack specificity, and are therefore not clinically useful in identifying and categorizing high-risk patients. As noted in the stroke risk section, we recommend the use of the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score given its superior sensitivity and ability to accurately and safely identify patients at low risk of stroke. Patients that are low risk (a score of 0 in males, 1 in females) do not require antithrombotic treatment.</p>
        <p>All AF patients with ≥ 1 stroke risk factors are candidates for stroke prevention with oral anticoagulation. At this point it is important to assess the bleeding risk. Although the benefit of stroke prevention outweighs the risk of bleeding in almost all patients, calculation of the bleeding risk allows the practitioner to identify potentially modifiable factors that elevate the bleeding risk (uncontrolled hypertension, concomitant use of antiplatelet or nonsteroidal agents, excessive alcohol intake; poor INR control (TTR&lt;65%) in VKA patients). In addition, patients identified as high risk for bleeding should be scheduled for more frequent follow-up and monitoring. As noted in the bleeding risk section, we make a consensus suggestion that the HAS-BLED score be used for this purpose, so those with a HAS-BLED score ≥3 can be flagged up for this reason.</p>
        <p>The final decision point is to decide which oral anticoagulant to use for stroke prevention. As noted in AT therapy and other approaches to stroke prevention, we recommend one of the NOACs (dabigatran, apixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban) as first line in patients with AF. These agents have not been compared head to head, and we therefore do not recommend one over the other. Local availability, cost, and patient co-morbidities might be considerations in choosing an agent (see Table 6) for comparative information. The vitamin K antagonists are still widely used and are an acceptable alternative with target TTR≥70%. As outlined in the section 'Factors affecting INR control', we recommend that the SAMe-TT 2 R 2 score be used to help identify patients likely to do well on VKA therapy.</p>
        <p>Bleeding on VKA Management of active bleeding on a VKA depends on the severity (Figure 6). For all bleed events, the site of bleeding should be assessed, with mechanical compression where appropriate, the time-point of the last dose of VKA should be obtained, with factors affecting bleeding risk documented (other medications, kidney function, alcohol abuse, other comorbidities) and hemodynamic status assessed (blood pressure, pulse etc.). Assessment of INR, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time is essential; other laboratory tests should include renal function, hemoglobin, hematocrit and platelet count. For minor bleeding, VKA administration should be withheld until INR&lt;2.0. Management of moderate bleeding requires prompt identification and intervention to treat the cause and may also necessitate fluid replacement and/or blood transfusion. Where bleeding is severe or life-threatening, immediate reversal of the anticoagulant effect is required and administration of IV vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma and prothrombin complex concentrates should be considered to restore coagulation. PCCs are preferred over FFP for reversal due to a higher concentration of clotting factors and less volume.</p>
        <p>Many physicians and patients have been reluctant to embrace NOACs due to their perception that they are not able to effectively manage patients who present with bleeding, particularly without a specific reversal agent or antidote. 205 A helpful framework to consider when managing NOAC related bleeding includes: (1) prevention of bleeding, (2) general principles and supportive measures, (3) non-specific hemostatic agents, and (4) NOAC-specific reversal agents. 206</p>
        <p>Selecting the right dose of the NOAC is the most important step to minimize bleeding risk. Prescribing information for all NOACS includes dose reduction criteria to avoid increased drug exposure (primarily due to impaired renal function). Concomitant administration of antiplatelet drugs and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided when possible as concomitant administration substantially increases bleeding risk. Blood pressure should be well-controlled.</p>
        <p>Given the short half-lives of these medications, minor bleeds may only require temporary discontinuation of anticoagulation for several doses. More significant bleeds may require additional supportive measures that include: local management (mechanical/surgical); volume resuscitation; and consideration of red blood cell and platelet transfusion, if appropriate. [207][208][209] In cases of overdose or in</p>
        <p>45 patients who took their last NOAC dose within 2 to 4 hours, oral activated charcoal may attenuate absorption of drug. [210][211][212][213]</p>
        <p>With respect to common coagulation tests, a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) indicates an anticoagulant effect of dabigatran, and a prolonged prothromin time (PT) indicates an anticoagulant effect of the FXa inhibitors. 208 However, the clinical utility of these common tests is limited due to the fact that a normal aPTT or PT does not exclude clinically relevant plasma levels of dabigatran and FXa inhibitors, respectively. The thrombin time (TT) is the most sensitive test for dabigatran; even low levels of dabigatran will prolong the TT so a normal TT excludes clinically relevant dabigatran concentrations. The dilute thrombin time (dTT) can be used to quantify dabigatran drug levels as it has good correlation across a wide range of dabigatran concentrations. 214 Chromogenic anti-FXa assays are recommended for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban with calibration for the specific agent. 208 However, validation of these specialized coagulation tests is required, they are not universally available, and often have delayed turn-around time which diminishes their usefulness in emergent situations. Asking patients when they took their last dose of NOAC is often the most practical method for quickly assessing residual anticoagulant activity.</p>
        <p>Hemostatic factors that have been studied as potential non-specific NOAC reversal agents including prothrombic complex concentrates (PCC), activated PCC (aPCC), recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa), and fresh-frozen plasma (FFP). PCCs are the preferred non-specific hemostatic agent for NOAC reversal. PCCs are plasma-derived products that contain 3 (factors II, IX, and X) or 4 (addition of factor VII) clotting factors in addition to variable amounts of heparin and the natural coagulation inhibitors protein C and protein S. Animal studies have demonstrated that PCC have variable ability to normalize anticoagulation parameters and prevent or attenuate bleeding across the NOACs. 209,[215][216][217][218][219][220][221] The limited data in humans are restricted to healthy volunteers. In three small (12-93 patients) randomized, placebo-controlled studies, PCC reversed the anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban and edoxaban but not dabigatran. 210,[222][223][224] There was a dose-dependent relationship with complete reversal with 50 U/kg and partial reversal with 25 U/kg. It is unclear whether normalizing coagulation parameters in healthy volunteers translates to improved outcomes in patients who are actively bleeding. Furthermore, the use of these agents in managing bleeding caused by VKA or in hemophiliac patients has been associated with an increased risk of thrombotic complications, especially when activated factors are used. [225][226][227]</p>
        <p>Idarucizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody fragment developed as a specific reversal agent for dabigatran (Table 7). It binds with high affinity (350 times higher than thrombin) to free and thrombinbound dabigatran 228 and binding is effectively irreversible. 229 The Reversal Effects of Idarucizumab on Active Dabigatran (RE-VERSE AD) study was a phase 3, global, prospective, cohort study investigating the</p>
        <p>46 safety and efficacy of 5g idarucizumab (administered as two rapid 2.5g intravenous boluses) in dabigatran-treated patients who present with uncontrolled or life-threatening bleeding (Group A) or non-bleeding patients who require emergent surgery or intervention (Group B). 230 Idarucizumab resulted in immediate, complete, and sustained reversal of dabigatran. Median time to cessation of bleeding in Group A was between 2.5 hours after reversal and in Group B, median time to surgery after reversal was 1.6 hours with intraoperative hemostasis deemed "normal" by investigators in 93.4% of patients. Idarucizumab has worldwide approval and availability.</p>
        <p>Andexanet alfa (andexanet) is a specific reversal agent for direct (apixaban, rivaroxaban and edoxaban) and indirect (low molecular weight heparins and fondaparinux) FXa inhibitors that act through antithrombin. It is a modified human recombinant FXa decoy protein that is catalytically inactive due to replacement of an active-site serine with alanine and with deletion of the membrane binding domain, which eliminates the ability to assemble the prothrombinase complex. Andexanet retains the ability to bind to NOACs with high affinity and a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio and by sequestering FXa inhibitors within the vascular space, endogenous FXa activity is restored. 231 Due to its pharmacodynamic half-life of 1hour, andexanet is administered as a bolus followed by an infusion. The ongoing ANNEXA-4 phase 3b-4 study (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02329327) is evaluating the efficacy and safety of andexanet in patients taking FXa inhibitors with acute major bleeding. Unlike RE-VERSE AD, this study does not include patients without bleeding but who require emergency or urgent procedures. A preliminary interim analysis of 67 patients demonstrated that an initial bolus and subsequent 2-hour infusion of andexanet substantially reduced anti-factor Xa activity with clinically adjudicated effective hemostasis occuring in 79% of patients. 232 Andexanet is in late stage review by regulatory authorities.</p>
        <p>Ciraparantag is a small synthetic water-soluble molecule developed as a reversal agent for unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparins, fondaparinux, and the oral direct Xa and IIa inhibitors. It binds to targets through non-covalent hydrogen bonding and charge-charge interactions thereby preventing the anticoagulants from binding to their endogenous targets. 233 Ciraparantag is earlier in it development program as compared with other specific reversal agents.</p>
        <p>The vast majority of bleeds can be managed conservatively with temporary discontinuation of NOACs and supportive measures. Reversal agents should be used sparingly in the cases of severe and lifethreatening bleeding which includes bleeding causing hemodynamic compromise, intracranial hemorrhage, bleeding into a critical organ or closed space, persistent bleeding despite general supportive measures and local hemostatic support, or risk of recurrent bleeding due to excess NOAC drug exposure due to delayed clearance of NOAC (e.g., acute renal failure) or overdose.</p>
        <p>In a patient with serious bleeding, a specific reversal agent (where available) should be used instead. General hemostatic agents as non-specific agents are less effective in reversing coagulation abnormalities, have not been shown to improve outcomes, and are potentially prothrombotic. Although coagulation testing will identify those patients with therapeutic levels of anticoagulation who will likely benefit from specific reversal agents, and helps physicians to monitor the response to reversal, it is reasonable to administer specific reversal agents immediately without waiting for a laboratory test confirming therapeutic levels of anticoagulation in patients who present with life-threatening bleeding presumed to be on a NOAC. Room temperature * For the indirect factor Xa inhibitors, andexanet alfa likely to completely reverse fondaparinux which only inhibits factor Xa but not low-molecular weight heparins which also inhibit factor IIa. # Lower dose to reverse apixaban, higher dose to reverse rivaroxaban</p>
        <p>In AF of documented short duration (i.e.≤48 h), urgent cardioversion commonly occurs without prolonged pre-cardioversion anticoagulation. In the context of elective cardioversion, whether electrical or chemical, therapeutic anticoagulation either with adjusted-dose VKAs, or NOACs is currently recommended for a minimum of 3 weeks before, and for a minimum of 4 weeks after the procedure. In AF of &gt;48 h duration or unknown duration, a TEE-guided approach provides an alternative strategy to guide anticoagulation management before cardioversion. In this section, we appraise and summarize the evidence and give recommendations for the use of antithrombotic therapy in patients undergoing electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion for AF (or atrial flutter). In particular, the option of NOACs in the setting of cardioversion is reviewed.</p>
        <p>Observational data support the use of VKA in the context of elective cardioversion, whether electrical or pharmacologic. A systematic review of 18 observational studies provides moderate-quality evidence for a lower risk of stroke or thromboembolism (TE) with peri-cardioversion anticoagulation (with VKA) versus no anticoagulation (0.3% vs 2.0%; relative risk, RR, 0.16, 95% CI, 0.05-0.48), but did not report major bleeding events 234 . The recommended duration of a minimum of 3 weeks' therapeutic anticoagulation with VKA before cardioversion and a minimum 4 weeks subsequently is arbitrary and has no trial basis, being based on indirect pathophysiologic and observational data. The rationale for maintenance of a therapeutic INR in the peri-cardioversion period is from observational data, showing that thromboembolism is significantly more common at INR of 1.5-2.4 before cardioversion than INR of 2.5 (0.93% vs 0%, P 0.012) 235 . Retrospective observational studies suggest that, after cardioversion, the highest risk of stroke and thromboembolism is in the first 72 hours. In addition, most thromboembolic complications are within 10 days of cardioversion 236 . However, even if sinus rhythm is restored on ECG, transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) studies have shown that atrial mechanical dysfunction can persist for several weeks following cardioversion 237 . Recent Finnish registry data suggest that most post-cardioversion strokes are associated with not using anticoagulation 238 . Although data relating to the impact of long-term anticoagulation postcardioversion are lacking, relevant Swedish observational data suggest that discontinuation of warfarin after catheter ablation is not safe in high-risk patients, especially those individuals with history of ischemic stroke 239 . It is also worth noting that although the risk of ischemic stroke/TE is higher with non-paroxysmal vs. paroxysmal AF (multivariable adjusted hazard ratio 1.38, 95% CI: 1.19-1.61, p&lt;0.001), pattern of AF does not affect the decision regarding long-term OAC.</p>
        <p>Evidence is available for all four currently available NOACs: dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban and edoxaban. An existing systematic review from Renda et al. compared the use of NOAC versus VKA in the setting of cardioversion in six studies. 240 Reported pooled risk ratios (RRR) were 0.82 (0.38-1.75) for stroke/systemic embolism, 0.72 (0.27-1.90) for mortality and 0.72 (0.19-2.71) for MI respectively, suggesting at least comparable efficacy of NOACs with VKA in the setting of cardioversion (e-Table 17). It should be noted that despite these reassuring data, the included trials were under-powered for safety and efficacy, and judged to be of poor quality. The need for consensus guidance is illustrated by the current wide variation in VKA and NOAC use in the setting of elective cardioversion 241,242 . Available data support use of rivaroxaban 243 244 , dabigatran 245 , apixaban 246 and edoxaban 247 in patients to be continued on these NOACs if scheduled for cardioversion. Similar observations were found in a randomized trial of apixaban vs. warfarin (EMANATE) 248 . A TEE-guided approach with abbreviated anticoagulation before cardioversion has been recommended as an alternative to the conventional approach of using a minimum of 3 weeks therapeutic pre-cardioversion anticoagulation as outlined above 249 . In the TEE--guided strategy, patients receive VKA and once therapeutic, undergo a screening TEE. If the TEE identifies thrombus in either the atrial appendage or atrium, cardioversion is postponed, given the presumed high risk of thromboembolism. In the absence of thrombus, cardioversion is immediately performed. Given the need for accurate visualization of thrombus, the TEE-guided strategy requires an experienced echocardiographer. The best data for the use of VKA in the TEE-guided approach is from the Assessment of Cardioversion Using Transesophageal Echocardiography (ACUTE) RCT, which compared a TEE-guided strategy of abbreviated therapeutic anticoagulation with IV unfractionated heparin (started 24 h before cardioversion) or warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0) (started 5 days before cardioversion) to a strategy of therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 3 weeks before cardioversion 250 . Overall, the evidence is of low quality, and therefore the results are not conclusive with respect to either a benefit or harm with the TEE-guided strategy versus the conventional approach of 3 weeks of anticoagulation pre-cardioversion. For NOACs vs. warfarin in the TEE-guided approach, our review found an existing systematic review and meta-analysis. 251 An updated search of this systematic review identified one additional study. Pooled results found the relative risk ratio for stroke/TE was 0.33 (0.06-1.68) for NOACs versus warfarin (e-Figure 3, e-table 18). Although these data indicate safety and probable equivalence of NOACs in the TEE-guided approach versus VKA, the trials were under-powered to show efficacy, and therefore the evidence is of low quality (e-Table 18). The advantage of NOACs is that their mode of action is quicker than VKA and therefore there is no delay in waiting for a therapeutic INR. However, the need for strict adherence to the NOAC therapy must be emphasized to patients, particularly in the post-cardioversion period. Individuals who are very symptomatic due to AF may gain greatest benefit from the TEE-guided approach since cardioversion can be expedited by a thrombus-negative TEE. In addition, a TEE-guided approach can be used to avoid prolonged VKA before cardioversion, which is a particular consideration in patients at increased risk for bleeding. The NOACs now offer an alternative to prolonged anticoagulation before</p>
        <p>ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 51 cardioversion. However, a "risk-based approach" to anticoagulation should be used, and avoiding anticoagulation with a TEE-guided strategy should only be considered in the absence of stroke risk factors and a low risk of recurrent AF. For patients undergoing a TEE-guided approach, low-molecular-weight heparin at full VTE treatment doses or IV unfractionated heparin (to maintain an activated partial thromboplastin time prolongation that corresponds to plasma heparin levels of 0.3-0.7 International Units/mL anti-factor Xa activity) should be started at the time of TEE and cardioversion performed within 24 hours of the TEE if no thrombus is seen. Observational data and one RCT show that low-molecular-weight heparin has similar efficacy compared with heparin or warfarin for immediate anticoagulation before TEE [252][253][254][255][256] . In the outpatient setting, a TEEguided approach should involve initiation of VKA (INR 2.5; range, 2.0-3.0) followed by the TEE and subsequent cardioversion scheduled 5 days later (if the INR is in therapeutic range at that time). The NOACs again offer an alternative in outpatient treatment before TEE-guided cardioversion, with no bridging therapy necessary. Among AF patients undergoing TEE, 10% have left atrial appendage thrombus with a 3.5-fold increased risk of stroke/TE 257 , but no specific data are available in the context of cardioversion. If atrial thrombus is seen on TEE, then there is heterogeneity in current clinical practice regarding both when or whether to perform the TEE again, as well as subsequent management of anticoagulation. There is no evidence to support reimaging, although it is a reasonable strategy. Although, current practice favors not performing cardioversion if re-imaging shows thrombus due to the presumed high risk of TE, there is a lack of direct data about the safety of cardioversion in the presence of thrombus. Taken together, a risk-based approach to anticoagulation can be recommended and with respect to TEE, individualization of therapy on a case-bycase basis is proposed. It should be noted that in a multicenter registry of AF patients undergoing catheter ablation, TEE-guided cardioversion did not show a benefit compared with uninterrupted NOAC therapy 258 . Although there is no direct evidence to guide decision-making about long-term management of anticoagulation in patients who appear to be in sinus rhythm at 4 weeks after cardioversion, but indirect evidence suggests strongly that long-term anticoagulation should be based on the risk of stroke rather than the apparent success of the cardioversion procedure. First, recurrence of AF at 1 year after cardioversion occurs in approximately one-half of patients and therefore long-term stroke risk is significant [259][260][261][262] . Second, the AFFIRM study, in which many patients stopped anticoagulation after initial (apparently) successful restoration of sinus rhythm, demonstrated similar rates of thromboembolism with a rhythm control strategy compared with a rate control strategy 263 . Thirdly, patients with paroxysmal AF are often asymptomatic during episodes of AF recurrence, with one series suggesting that only one in every 12 paroxysms are symptomatic 264 .</p>
        <p>The duration of AF necessary for development of thrombus is not clear. Therefore, the threshold of AF duration below which pre-cardioversion anticoagulation can be safely avoided is not known. It is common practice to cardiovert without TEE or prolonged pre-cardioversion anticoagulation if AF is of short duration (&lt;48 hours). The problem with this approach is the presence of left atrial thrombus on TEE in up to 14% of patients with AF of short duration in observational studies 265,266 . In addition, the high prevalence of asymptomatic AF makes determining the exact duration of AF difficult 267 . If there is uncertainty about precise time of AF onset, then such patients should be managed as if AF &gt;48 hours.</p>
        <p>A recent Finnish observational study of 5,116 successful cardioversions in 2,481 patients with acute (&lt;48 h) AF showed low incidence of stroke/TE during the 30 days following cardioversion, even without perioperative anticoagulation (0.7%) 268 . These results concur with low rates of stroke/TE in observational studies (Table 8). However, there is lower incidence of stroke/TE with cardioversions performed during anticoagulation (0.1% vs 0.7%, p=0.001), and with anticoagulation versus no anticoagulation in patients with a CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score of ≥2 (0.2% vs 1.1%, p=0.001). It should also be noted that there is a high risk of recurrence of the composite of cardioversion failure and recurrence of AF within 30 days (40%) in acute AF 269 . Overall, the evidence suggests that peri-cardioversion anticoagulation is beneficial and that the decision regarding peri-and post-cardioversion anticoagulation should be based on risk of stroke/TE 268 , even if an individual is presenting for the first time with AF.</p>
        <p>Remark: Decisions about long-term anticoagulation after cardioversion should be made in accordance with our risk-based recommendations for long-term antithrombotic therapy in recommendations 1 and 2</p>
        <p>Our systematic review of anticoagulation versus no anticoagulation in patients with AF undergoing urgent found no published data regarding the optimal anticoagulation strategy to use before or during urgent cardioversion for patients with AF and hemodynamic instability. On the basis of the above evidence for anticoagulation in elective cardioversion, initiation of anticoagulation immediately before urgent cardioversion (e.g., with IV unfractionated heparin or low-molecular weight heparin) would be expected to reduce the risk of stroke/TE based on studies of elective cardioversion. Initiation of anticoagulation therapy should not delay any emergency interventions required in order to stabilize the patient.</p>
        <p>pharmacologic), after successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm, we suggest therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks after successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm rather than no anticoagulation, regardless of baseline stroke risk (weak recommendation, low quality evidence).</p>
        <p>Remark: Decisions about anticoagulation beyond 4 weeks should be made in accordance with our riskbased recommendations for long-term antithrombotic therapy in recommendations 1 and 2.</p>
        <p>There are no specific trials which have considered electrical cardioversion in the context of atrial flutter and associated anticoagulation. Despite the low risk of TE after cardioversion for atrial flutter, which has been suggested by some observational studies, even in absence of anticoagulation, other studies have shown a similar risk of TE in patients after cardioversion for atrial flutter and AF 235,275,276 , perhaps due to co-existence of AF and atrial flutter. Adults with congenital heart disease represent a growing, important population with atrial flutter where long-term studies of outcomes with anticoagulation are required.</p>
        <p>19. For patients with atrial flutter undergoing elective or urgent pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion, we suggest that the same approach to thromboprophylaxis be used as for patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing cardioversion. (ungraded consensus-based statement).</p>
        <p>ACS and/or PCI AF commonly coexists with vascular disease, whether coronary, carotid or peripheral artery disease 277,278 . Some AF patients with coronary disease may present with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Whether stable or acute, such patients may undergo percutaneous intervention with stent deployment. This section deals with the antithrombotic therapy management of this group of patients. There are 4 considerations when managing these patients, as follows 277,279 :</p>
        <p>• Stroke prevention, necessitating OAC, whether with VKA or NOAC • Prevention of stent thrombosis, necessitating antiplatelet therapy (APT). There is evidence for using DAPT for up to 12 months in non-AF patients. • Prevention of recurrent cardiac ischemia in an ACS patient, necessitating APT. There is some evidence for using DAPT for beyond 12 months in non-AF patients from the DAPT and PEGASUS</p>
        <p>trials, to reduce non-stent related ischemic and stroke events, but at the risk of more bleeding events 280 . • Serious bleeding risks (e.g., ICH) with the combination of OAC and one or more antiplatelet drug Additional considerations are the duration of treatment, acute or stable setting, type of APT, stent type, OAC type, bleeding risks, etc. Bleeding risk can be assessed by various bleeding risk scores, with the focus on modifiable bleeding risk factors; however, the HAS-BLED score is predictive of bleeding in the setting of ACS and/or PCI-stenting 110 . Coronary stent technology has also evolved, with small strut sizes necessitating shorter duration of dual APT (DAPT, i.e. aspirin plus P2Y12 inhibitor such as clopidogrel). We are also in the era of NOACs, which may offer a better safety profile compared to VKA based therapy. Nonetheless the latter may be relatively safe in the presence of well managed anticoagulation control with high TTR 281 . AF patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention Various case series and cohort studies of AF patients undergoing PCI/stenting have been reported. These have been systematically reviewed as part of the 2014 and 2018 joint European consensus documents, endorsed by HRS and APHRS, which provides consensus recommendations on optimal management of such patients 277,279 . A similar North American expert consensus document has been published 282 . In a systematic review and meta-analysis (18 studies with 20,456 patients with AF; 7,203 patients received DAPT + VKA and 13,253 patients received DAPT after PCI-S) Chaudhary et al 283 , showed that DAPT and VKA was associated with significantly lower risk of stroke, stent thrombosis, and all-cause mortality, but the risk of major bleeding was significantly higher in the DAPT and VKA group.</p>
        <p>Broadly similar conclusions were drawn from the systematic review and meta-analysis (17 studies, 104,639 patients) by Zhu et al 284 where triple therapy (DAPT+OAC) was associated with an increased risk of bleeding compared with DAPT alone, with no differences observed between triple therapy and the dual therapy for all-cause death, cardiovascular death, or thrombotic complications (i.e., acute coronary syndrome, stent thrombosis, thromboembolism/stroke, and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events). In both systematic reviews, there was marked heterogeneity in study size, patient population, intervention types, stent use, etc. Bennaghmouch et al 285 reported a meta-analysis restricted to the subgroups of patients on aspirin therapy (n=21,722) from the four RCTs comparing VKA and NOACs (N=71,681) in AF patients. NOACs were more effective (outcome stroke or systemic embolism HR: 0.78 [95% CI, 0.67-0.91] and vascular death HR 0.85 [0.76-0.93]) and as safe as VKA with respect to major bleeding (HR: 0.83 [95% CI, 0.69-1.01]). NOACs were safer with respect to the reduction of intracranial hemorrhage (HR: 0.38 [0.26-0.56]). Thus, it may be both safer and more effective to use NOACs as compared with VKA to treat patients with non-valvular AF and concomitant aspirin therapy. The largest observational cohort was reported by Lamberts et al 286 , which included a total of 12,165 AF patients (60.7% male; mean age 75.6 years) hospitalized with MI and/or undergoing PCI between 2001 and 2009. Relative to triple therapy (OAC plus DAPT, i.e. aspirin plus clopidogrel), no increased risk of recurrent coronary events was seen for OAC plus clopidogrel (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.48 to 1.00), OAC plus</p>
        <p>56 aspirin (HR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.77 to 1.19), or aspirin plus clopidogrel (HR: 1.17, 95% CI: 0.96 to 1.42), but aspirin plus clopidogrel was associated with a higher risk of ischemic stroke (HR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.03 to 2.20). OAC plus aspirin and aspirin plus clopidogrel were associated with a significant increased risk of all-cause death (HR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.17 to 1.99 and HR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.25 to 2.05, respectively). When compared to triple therapy, bleeding risk was non-significantly lower for OAC plus clopidogrel (HR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.55 to 1.12) and significantly lower for OAC plus aspirin and aspirin plus clopidogrel. Thus, OAC and clopidogrel was equal or better for both benefit and safety outcomes compared to triple therapy. However, this analysis provides limited information on the duration of therapies, quality of INR control, stent type, underlying bleeding risk profile, etc.</p>
        <p>Prospective RCTs in AF patients presenting with ACS and/or undergoing PCI/stenting are limited. The first trial was the WOEST trial 287 , which randomized 573 adults receiving oral anticoagulants (65% with AF) and undergoing PCI to clopidogrel alone (double therapy) or clopidogrel plus aspirin (triple therapy). The primary endpoint of 'any bleeding' was seen in 19•4% receiving double therapy and 44•4% receiving triple therapy (HR 0•36, 95% CI 0•26-0•50, p&lt;0•0001). Of the secondary endpoints, there was no increase in the rate of thrombotic events, but all-cause mortality was higher in the triple therapy arm. This trial was underpowered for efficacy and safety endpoints, and the primary endpoint of 'any bleeding' was driven by minor bleeds given that triple therapy was mandated for 12 months. The duration of triple therapy was also addressed by the ISAR-TRIPLE trial 288 , a RCT in 614 patients receiving OAC plus aspirin, randomized to either 6-weeks of clopidogrel therapy (n=307) or 6-months of clopidogrel therapy (n=307). The primary endpoint (composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI), definite stent thrombosis, stroke, or Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) major bleeding at 9 months) occurred in 30 patients (9.8%) in the 6-week group compared with 27 patients (8.8%) in the 6-month group (HR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.68 to 1.91; p=0.63). There were no significant differences for the secondary combined ischemic endpoint of cardiac death, MI, definite stent thrombosis, and ischemic stroke (12 [4.0%] vs. 13 [4.3%]; HR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.43 to 2.05; p=0.87) or the secondary bleeding endpoint of TIMI major bleeding (16 [5.3%] vs. 12 [4.0%]; HR: 1.35; 95% CI: 0.64 to 2.84; p=0.44). Thus, 6 weeks of triple therapy was not superior to 6 months of therapy with respect to net clinical outcomes, suggesting that physicians should weigh the trade-off between ischemic and bleeding risk when choosing a shorter or longer duration of triple therapy. In the PIONEER AF-PCI trial 289 , 2,124 patients with AF undergoing PCI with stenting were randomized to low-dose rivaroxaban (15 mg once daily, reduced to 10mg with moderate renal impairment) plus a P2Y12 inhibitor for 12 months (group 1), very-low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) plus DAPT for 1, 6, or 12 months (group 2), or standard VKA (once daily) plus DAPT for 1, 6, or 12 months (group 3). The rates of clinically significant bleeding were lower in the two groups receiving rivaroxaban than in the VKA group (16.8% in group 1, 18.0% in group 2, and 26.7% in group 3; hazard ratio for group 1 vs. group 3, 0.59; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.76; P&lt;0.001; hazard ratio for group 2 vs. group 3, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.80; P&lt;0.001). The rates of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke were similar in the three groups but the trial was underpowered for efficacy endpoints. There was only a minority of newer P2Y12 inhibitors used</p>
        <p>There was an associated reduction in hospitalizations in the 2 rivaroxaban arms, compared to VKA 290 . In the RE-DUAL PCI trial 291 , randomized 2,725 patients with AF who had undergone PCI to triple therapy with warfarin plus a P2Y 12 inhibitor (clopidogrel or ticagrelor) and aspirin (for 1 to 3 months) (triple-therapy group) or dual therapy with dabigatran (110 mg or 150 mg twice daily) plus a P2Y 12 inhibitor (clopidogrel or ticagrelor) and no aspirin (110-mg and 150-mg dual-therapy groups). Outside the United States, elderly patients (≥80 years of age; ≥70 years of age in Japan) were randomly assigned to the 110-mg dual-therapy group or the triple-therapy group. The incidence of the primary end point (major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding) was 15.4% in the 110-mg dual-therapy group compared with 26.9% in the triple-therapy group (HR 0.52; 95%CI 0.42 to 0.63; P&lt;0.001 for non-inferiority; P&lt;0.001 for superiority) and 20.2% in the 150-mg dual-therapy group as compared with 25.7% in the corresponding triple-therapy group, which did not include elderly patients outside the United States (HR 0.72; 95%CI 0.58 to 0.88; P&lt;0.001 for noninferiority). The incidence of the composite efficacy end point of thromboembolic events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or systemic embolism), death, or unplanned revascularization was 13.7% in the two dualtherapy groups combined as compared with 13.4% in the triple-therapy group (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.29; P=0.005 for non-inferiority). Thus, the risk of bleeding was lower among those who received dual therapy with dabigatran and a P2Y12 inhibitor than among those who received triple therapy with warfarin, a P2Y12 inhibitor, and aspirin. Dual therapy was non-inferior to triple therapy with respect to the risk of thromboembolic events. In contrast to the PIONEER-AF trial, the REDUAL PCI trial tested dabigatran doses (110mg and 150mg bid) which are licensed for stroke prevention in AF. There are limited data on use of the newer P2Y12 inhibitors (ticagrelor, prasugrel) with OAC. Observational cohorts in AF patients report a higher bleeding rate where these newer APT agents are used as part of a triple therapy regime, compared to when clopidogrel is used as part of the triple therapy regime 292 . Only a minority of patients in PIONEER AF-PCI had newer P2Y12 agents, whereas the largest experience in AF patients was in the RE-DUAL PCI trial, which allowed ticagrelor in combination with dabigatran 110mg or 150mg bid. In the GEMINI-ACS-1 trial 293 , 3037 patients with ACS (i.e. essentially a non-AF population) were randomly assigned to either aspirin 100mg or rivaroxaban 2.5mg bid, and the subsequent choice of clopidogrel (44%) or ticagrelor (in 56%) during trial conduct was non-randomized. Low-dose rivaroxaban with a P2Y12 inhibitor for the treatment of ACS patients had similar risks of clinically significant bleeding (5%) as aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor</p>
        <p>The presence of vascular disease adds to stroke risk in patients with AF. In the Danish registries, AF patients with vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction, prior peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque) as a single risk factor have a high stroke rate of 4.85 per 100 person-years 294 . This corresponds to CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc=1 for males and a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc=2 for females, with rates of 4.53 and 5.69, respectively. Contrasting low risk CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc (that is, score 0 (male) or 1 (female)) as a reference population vs. those with ≥1 additional stroke risk factors (i.e. CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score =1 (male) or =2 (females)), the risk attributable to</p>
        <p>58 vascular disease had a crude HR of 2.7 (95%CI 1.7-4.2). In Asian countries 295 , PAD may confer an ischemic stroke risk that is much higher than that seen in Western populations 296 . In AF patients with stable CAD there is no evidence that adding APT to OAC reduces stroke/SE, death, or MI. However, the risk of major bleeding and ICH is substantially increased with the addition of APT to OAC. The largest cohort was reported by Lamberts et al 297 where 8700 AF patients (mean age, 74.2 years; 38% women) with stable CAD (defined as 12 months from an acute coronary event) followed-up for a mean 3.3 years, found the risk of myocardial infarction/coronary death was similar for VKA plus aspirin (HR 1.12; 95% CI 0.94-1.34]) and VKA plus clopidogrel (HR 1.53; 95% CI 0.93-2.52]), relative to VKA monotherapy, However, the risk of bleeding increased &gt;50% when aspirin (HR 1.50; 95% CI 1.23-1.82]) or clopidogrel (HR 1.84; 95% CI 1.11-3.06]) was added to VKA. In the RCTs of NOACs compared to warfarin, aspirin at &lt;100mg daily was allowed. Ancillary analyses show no added benefit of adding aspirin on stroke or mortality rates; however, absolute bleeding rates were higher with combination therapy, but the relative efficacy and safety with NOAC vs. warfarin use was maintained irrespective of aspirin use 298 . Only the RELY trial showed data for combination of dabigatran with aspirin and/or clopidogrel, and as expected, major bleeding risks were increased with a single APT and further increased where 2 APTs were used 299 .</p>
        <p>Less data are evident for OAC use in AF patients with stable isolated PAD or carotid disease, in relation to OAC use. However, it is reasonable to assume that data for CAD would be generally applicable to PAD or carotid disease. One post-hoc ancillary analysis 300 from the ROCKET-AF trial reported that the efficacy of rivaroxaban when compared with warfarin for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism was similar in patients with PAD (HR: 1.19, 95% CI: 0.63-2.22) and without PAD (HR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.73-1.02; interaction P = 0.34). However, there was a higher risk of major bleeding or NMCR bleeding with rivaroxaban when compared with warfarin in AF patients with PAD (HR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.06-1.86) compared with those without PAD (HR: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.95-1.11; interaction P = 0.037).</p>
        <p>Randomized trials have shown that uninterrupted warfarin is safe and superior to warfarin interruption for implantation of cardiac implantable electronic devices. 7 For catheter ablation, anticoagulation guidelines pertinent to cardioversion generally apply to periprocedural anticoagulation and are detailed in a recent professional society expert consensus statement 301 . In a randomized trial of 1584 patients, uninterrupted warfarin, compared to interruption with heparin bridging, has been shown to have a lower risk of periprocedural stroke and bleeding 302 . A randomized trial of uninterrupted rivaroxaban vs. uninterrupted VKA in AF ablation demonstrated similar event rates in both arms 303 . A similar randomized trial of uninterrupted dabigatran found that dabigatran was associated with fewer bleeding complications than uninterrupted warfarin 304 . Although these studies were open-label, they strongly support the use of uninterrupted anticoagulation for electrophysiology procedures (Table 9). Two recent systematic reviews with meta-analyses that include these studies found consistent with results 305,306 .</p>
        <p>Clinical observations indicate that AF and stroke are often temporally discordant, with stroke occurring during periods of sinus rhythm in the majority of patients with paroxysmal AF 307,308 .</p>
        <p>After catheter ablation, discontinuation of OAC is associated with an increased risk of stroke 301 . Similarly, post-operative AF may confer a long-term risk of stroke. In a U.S. claims analysis of 1.7 million patients hospitalized for surgery, perioperative atrial fibrillation was associated with an increased long-term risk of ischemic stroke, especially following non-cardiac surgery 309 . It is not known to what extent the risk was mediated by AF recurrence (often asymptomatic) or was independent of rhythm. Thus, patients should be anticoagulated according to their thromboembolic risk profile based on CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc, regardless of whether sinus rhythm has been restored via ablation, cardioversion, or other means. In AF-associated acute ischemic stroke, the risk of early recurrence is high: for example, the International Stroke Trial reported a 4.8% risk of recurrent stroke in those with AF within the first 2 days 311 , while other studies suggest a recurrence risk of between 0.4% and 1.3% per day in the first 7-14 days [311][312][313][314][315] . AF-related ischemic strokes are more often disabling or fatal than other types, with longer hospital stays and higher costs 316 , so preventing early recurrence is a key clinical challenge.</p>
        <p>The safety and benefit of OAC in acute stroke have not been established. Early anticoagulation (i.e. in the first few days) might increase the risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, including hemorrhagic transformation of the infarct (estimated at ~1% per day 317 ), leading to clinical uncertainty about when to start anticoagulation. Recent studies reported an 8-10% risk of recurrent ischemic stroke and a 2-4% risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 90 days of AF-related ischemic stroke 318,319 .</p>
        <p>Current uncertainty regarding optimal timing of anticoagulation Current guidelines do not provide clear recommendations on the timing of OAC after acute AFrelated stroke. US guidelines suggest that commencing OAC within 14 days is reasonable 320 A recent observational study (n=1029) suggested that anticoagulation at 4-14 days after cardioembolic stroke had the best outcome, but did not have statistical power to determine benefit of earlier anticoagulation 322 . Increasing cerebral infarct size is associated with increased risk of both symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation and early recurrent ischemia 317 A systematic review and meta-analysis of 7 randomized trials of unfractionated heparin (UFH), lowmolecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or heparinoids (n=4624) started &lt;48 hours, vs. aspirin or placebo, found that early anticoagulation was associated with non-significantly reduced recurrent ischemic stroke, but with increased intracranial bleeding, and no reduction in death or disability (e-Table 19). 314 In contrast, other small studies suggested fewer ischemic strokes without an increase in intracranial bleeding, as well as reduced mortality and disability with early initiation of vitamin K antagonists (to achieve therapeutic levels by day 7) 319,[323][324][325] . Observational data suggest that the use of low molecular weight heparin (as a "bridging" strategy) together with oral anticoagulation is associated with a higher risk of symptomatic hemorrhage. 318,[326][327][328] Observational studies suggest early (&lt;14 days) anticoagulation with NOACs might be safe 318 319,322 329 . One study reported improved outcomes and no early ICH with NOAC started at a median of 4 330,331 . The Pre-TIMING observational study of 249 patients with AFassociated acute ischemic stroke treated with OAC (&lt;5 days) reported in-hospital recurrent ischemic stroke in 4.4%, and symptomatic ICH in 3.1% 332 .</p>
        <p>There are no large trials of NOACs including patients within 7-14 days of a stroke, but one small study (Triple AXEL) randomized 195 patients with AF-related acute ischemic stroke to rivaroxaban or warfarin &lt;5 days and found similar rates of symptomatic/asymptomatic MRI-defined recurrent ischemia (~30%) or intracranial bleeding (~30%) at 4 weeks, with reduced hospital stay for rivaroxaban 333 .</p>
        <p>Remark: Heparinoids should not be used as bridging therapy in the acute phase of ischaemic stroke because they appear to increase the risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage without net benefit. The optimal timing of anticoagulation after acute ischaemic stroke is unknown.</p>
        <p>Remark: The optimal timing of anticoagulation early after acute ischaemic stroke is unknown. Early use of NOACs shows promise but requires testing in randomised controlled trials. 36. In AF patients with acute ischaemic stroke, We suggest that oral anticoagulation should usually be started within 2 weeks of acute ischaemic stroke, but the optimal timing within this period is not known (ungraded consensus-based statement).</p>
        <p>Remark: Although infarct size is clinically used to guide timing of anticoagulation, it is predictive of a higher risk of early recurrent ischaemia, haemorrhagic transformation of the infarct, and poor outcome, so might not be helpful in determining the net benefit of early treatment. Remark: Anticoagulation with NOACs soon after stroke (earlier than 1 week) has not been tested in randomised trials, but shows promise in observational studies.</p>
        <p>Spontaneous (non-traumatic) intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) causes about 1 in 10 strokes, and is caused by the rupture of a cerebral artery or arteriole, most often a small vessel affected by either hypertensive arteriopathy or cerebral amyloid angiopathy. ICH is the most feared, often lethal, complication of antithrombotic (anticoagulant and antiplatelet) therapy. Recent data indicate that about 50% of people with ICH are taking an antithrombotic agent at the time of ICH. 334 In a recent hospital ICH cohort study, 25% of patients had AF 335 Risk of ischemic stroke Survivors of ICH with AF are at risk of further brain ischemia but also recurrent ICH. The use of antithrombotic therapy (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants) following ICH thus presents a major clinical dilemma. The risk of ischemic stroke with and without antithrombotic treatment must be</p>
        <p>weighed carefully against the possible increase in ICH risk associated with antithrombotic therapy. The risk of ischemic stroke in people with AF is typically estimated using instruments such as the CHA 2 DS 2 VASC score and it seems reasonable to use this score in populations of ICH survivors 336 .</p>
        <p>The future risk of ICH is highly variable; the annual recurrence risk was between 1.8% and 7.4% in one recent systematic review of observational studies 337 . Computed tomography is a highly sensitive test for ICH and can classify the location as "lobar" (originating in the lobes of the brain) or "deep" (originating in the basal ganglia or brainstem). 338 The risk of recurrence has been reported to be higher for lobar ICH than after deep ICH, 337 a finding which is probably related to different underlying small vessel diseases that cause ICH in the different locations. Although CT can define ICH location, it cannot reliably identify the underlying type of causal small vessel disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can identify biomarkers of small vessel disease including cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), whose distribution can be used to diagnose cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) with high specificity in ICH cohorts 339 . In a recent pooled analysis of observational studies, patients with ICH classified using CMBs as due to CAA had a ~7% annual recurrence risk, compared with ~1% for those not fulfilling criteria for CAA 340 .</p>
        <p>Since oral anticoagulants increase the risk of ICH, some experts have recommended avoiding them in patients with ICH attributed to CAA. In survivors of ischemic stroke and TIA, CMBs are also associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke, although as the number of CMBs increases, the risk of future ICH increases more steeply than that of ischemic stroke. 341 In ICH survivors the number of CMBs is also associated with the risk of recurrent ICH. 342 Balancing the risks of ischemic stroke and recurrent ICH A decision analysis which modelled warfarin for AF in an ICH survivor suggested that in lobar ICH avoiding warfarin increased quality-adjusted life (QOL) years by 1.9, compared with 0.3 for deep ICH; the authors concluded that anticoagulation for AF should not be offered to patients with lobar ICH and only to survivors of deep ICH if the risk of ischemic events was high (&gt;7% per year) 343 . However, CMBs were not considered in this analysis. In contrast, recent "real-world" observational studies(including some very large registry datasets) from ICH survivors with AF suggest that anticoagulation might reduce mortality and ischemic complications, without an unacceptable increase in ICH.</p>
        <p>A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies suggested that restarting anticoagulation was associated with a significantly lower risk of thromboembolic complications (pooled RR 0.34; 95% CI 0.25-0.45; Q=5.12, P for heterogeneity=0.28) with no increased risk of recurrent ICH (pooled RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.58-1.77; Q=24.68, P for heterogeneity &lt;0.001). 344 However, none of the real world studies stratified ICH by location, nor by CMB burden or distribution. Two small randomized studies of early anticoagulation after ICH were not able to confirm benefit or harm. 345,346 There are no reliable randomized trial data to guide the timing of anticoagulation after ICH. In acute ICH, hematoma expansion is common, and is aggravated by anticoagulation. Anticoagulants should therefore be reversed and avoided in acute ICH (&lt;24-48 hours).</p>
        <p>A survival model based on observational data indicated that the total stroke risk (both ischemic and ICH) was lowest when anticoagulation was restarted after about 10 weeks, and a delay of at least 4 weeks after ICH was suggested. 347 There are no large scale randomized controlled trials to answer the question of whether long-term anticoagulation has net benefit in ICH survivors with AF. NOACs have a ~50% lower ICH risk than VKA 127 , and are therefore preferred in most ICH survivors, except where warfarin is indicated (e.g. in those with metallic mechanical heart valves). Observational data suggest that ICH occurring on OAC are of similar size and with similar clinical outcome in patients taking VKA or NOACs. 348 There are two ongoing randomized trials of antithrombotic use after ICH: APACHE-AF (http://apache-af.nl -aspirin vs. apixaban vs. no antithrombotics for the treatment of AF in patients after ICH) and RESTART (www.restarttrial.org -antiplatlets vs, no antiplatelets in patients with ICH with an indication for antiplatelets).</p>
        <p>Randomized trials indicate that left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) has similar efficacy to oral anticoagulation in patients with AF; thus, in ICH survivors with AF and high ischemic stroke risk, LAAO is a potentially attractive option to reduce ischemic stroke and systemic embolism from AF without the need to expose patients to a long-term risk of oral anticoagulation. 349 Observational data from 1025 patients suggest that LAAO might be safe and effective in patients with a contraindication to long term oral anticoagulation, but only a minority of patients (15%) in this study had suffered ICH. 350 Small studies of ICH survivors suggest that LAAO, using antiplatelet treatment as periprocedural antithrombotic treatment, is safe and effective in this population, including those with CAA 351,352</p>
        <p>Remark: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy should be diagnosed using validated clinico-radiological criteria.</p>
        <p>Carotid stenosis is present in about 8% of people over the age of 60. 353 A recent multicenter retrospective study found &gt;50% carotid stenosis in 18.3% of patients with AF, which was associated with a doubling of stroke risk. 354 Thus in patients with both carotid stenosis and AF there are indications for both anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy, yet this combination, at least in the long term, is associated with high bleeding risk and is thus generally not recommended. Randomized trials show superiority for carotid endarterectomy over stenting in patients with symptomatic stenosis (&gt;50%) of the internal carotid artery. 355 This could reduce the need for combination therapy with OAC and antiplatelet drugs in those with AF. Current practice is to treat all potential stroke risk factors including AF and carotid stenosis. Those who have had successful carotid revascularization are typically managed with OAC alone. In patients with carotid stenosis not treated by revascularization (including those with asymptomatic disease) as well as AF, the optimal management is not known and requires further randomized data; meanwhile, decisions need to be tailored to the individual patient.</p>
        <p>In patients with AF and symptomatic carotid stenosis (&gt;50%), we suggest carotid revascularisation with endarterectomy or stenting in addition to OAC as indicated (Weak recommendation, moderate quality evidence).</p>
        <p>Remark: There is limited evidence to guide the optimal treatment of patients with AF and carotid stenosis not requiring revascularisation. Remark: Short-term concomitant antiplatelet therapy (dual or mono) is generally used in the immediate post-revascularisation period (e.g. 1-3 months)</p>
        <p>In North America and Europe, about 1 in 4 ischemic strokes remain of uncertain etiology (i.e. not attributable to definite cardiac embolism, large artery atherosclerosis, or small artery disease), despite adequate investigation, and are termed "cryptogenic". 320,356 Because most cryptogenic strokes are embolic, a more recent concept of embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) has been developed, defined as ischemic stroke detected by CT or MRI that, after a standardized and adequate diagnostic pathway including brain imaging, echocardiography, cardiac rhythm monitoring for at least 24 hours, and imaging of the intracranial and extracranial arteries supplying the affected brain area: is not lacunar (subcortical, less than 15mm diameter); where there is absence of extracranial or intracranial atherosclerosis causing ≥50% 357 . Thus, ESUS is a sub-category of cryptogenic stroke, accounting for about 1 in 6 ischemic strokes. 358 A careful and systematic diagnostic work up in patients with ESUS is needed as there might be important management differences between underlying embolic sources if detected, such as aortic arch atheroma, patent foramen ovale, and paroxysmal AF. This brief section only refers to the latter.</p>
        <p>As a general principle, AF can be detected in a high proportion of ESUS patients, if we 'look harder, look longer and look with more sophisticated monitoring' (Table 10). Screening consecutive patients with ischemic stroke with routine Holter or event loop recorder monitoring will identify new AF/atrial flutter in approximately 1 in 20 patients 359 . Two randomized controlled trials clearly showed that prolonged cardiac monitoring increases the detection of occult AF in patients with TIA or acute ischemic stroke presenting in sinus rhythm. In CRYSTAL AF, 441 patients randomly assigned to prolonged ambulatory cardiac monitoring with a subcutaneous implantable loop recorder or to a control group with conventional follow-up, detected more AF in the monitored group (8.9% vs. 1.4% in the control group; HR 6.4, 95% CI 1.9-21.7); 360 while in EMBRACE, 572 patients randomly assigned to additional ambulatory monitoring with a 30day external loop recorder (intervention group) or a 24-hour Holter monitor (control group) found more AF in the intervention group (16.1% vs. 3.2% in the control group; absolute difference, 12.9 % 95% CI 8.0-17.6). 361 In a systematic review and meta-analysis, Sposato et al 362 described a much higher rate of AF detection after multi-phase sequential cardiac monitoring, at 23.7% (Table 10). Despite this, one recent analysis only found that 2.6% and 9.7% of stroke patients had ambulatory ECG monitoring in the 7 days and 12 months post-stroke leading to underdiagnosis. 363</p>
        <p>Unsurprisingly, AF is more likely to be detected in elderly patients with more prolonged monitoring, especially if there is evidence of prior embolic cortical or cerebellar infarction 364,365 .</p>
        <p>In a retrospective analysis, newly detected atrial tachycardia (AT) or AF (NDAF; AT/AF &gt;5 minutes on any day) was identified in 30% patients with implantable cardiac rhythm devices and ≥1 stroke risk factors during a follow-up of 1.1 years 366 . The presence of AT/AF &gt;6 hours on ≥1 day increased significantly with increased CHADS 2 scores. Similarly, the ASSERT-II study reported that subclinical AF lasting ≥5 minutes was present in 34.4% per year, in a prospective cohort of elderly patients with risk factors but no prior stroke 367 . Of note, data from the Athens Stroke Registry show that the CHADS 2 and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scores are independently associated with the risk of ischemic stroke/TIA recurrence and death in ESUS patients, with the risk of stroke recurrence and death in patients with a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score ≥2 being approximately 3-fold and 15-fold higher compared with that in patients with a score of 0, respectively 368 . If ESUS is phenotypically different from AF-associated stroke, we should see differences in stroke severity and outcomes; however, no difference in NIHSS score was evident in ESUS where AF was detected on follow-up, compared to where no AF was evident 369 . Nevertheless, it remains possible that within ESUS there is a spectrum of underlying proximal embolic sources, suggested by the strong effect of age on recurrence risk and mortality 370 . Current guidelines recommend use of antiplatelet agents including aspirin in ESUS patients 320 unless AF is detected (often requiring prolonged work up, as above), when such patients would be managed with oral anticoagulation. The available data (mainly from retrospective observational studies) suggest a sizeable rate of stroke recurrence (more than 4% per year) despite the frequent use of antiplatelet agents in clinical practice. 358 Thus, there is an important clinical need for more effective antithrombotic therapy for ESUS. Since a large proportion of ESUS are likely to be due to undetected AF, oral anticoagulation is a theoretically attractive option. Ongoing randomized trials comparing NOACs to aspirin in ESUS patients are in progress. Prior to data from these trials, physicians might, in the meantime, consider the use of anticoagulation in parallel with continued cardiac evaluation (e.g. prolonged rhythm monitoring) after discussion and consideration of patient preference.</p>
        <p>Cardiac implanted electrical devices (CIEDs) with an atrial lead or with capability of rhythm discrimination (i.e. implantable cardiac monitors) allow continuous monitoring of the cardiac rhythm and appropriate detection of atrial tachyarrhythmias, including AF, as atrial high-rate episodes (AHREs) as well as storing arrhythmia electrograms in the device's memory for review and specific diagnosis. AHREs, currently defined as episodes of at least 5 min of atrial tachyarrhythmias/AF with an atrial rate &gt;180 bpm, are usually asymptomatic, discovered during routine device follow-up and</p>
        <p>70 classified in terms of duration of the single episode or time spent in atrial tachyarrhythmias during a day (from minutes to hours) [371][372][373][374][375][376][377] . Although temporal cut-offs for detection and storage of AHRE data as short as 30-60 seconds have been used, the diagnostic accuracy is reliable when episodes ≥5 minutes in duration are considered, since, using this cut-off, the appropriateness in AF detection is 95%, minimizing the risk of oversensing due to detection of artefacts caused by myopotentials or other sources of electrical interference 378,379 . Individual patient analysis of electrograms corresponding to AHREs is clinically indicated to exclude artifacts or other causes of inappropriate detection of atrial tachyarrhythmias or AF. Electrograms of AHREs correspond to intracardiac electrograms recorded from right atrial appendage or right atrium so a diagnosis of tachyarrhythmias can be easily made through analysis of tracings recorded in the device's memory 159 . After detection of AHREs by CIEDs, conventional Holter or other ECG long-term recordings (i.e., patient operated devices) can be considered in specific cases (e.g. unavailable electrograms or unclear diagnosis at device electrograms analysis). The possibility of continuous monitoring of AF through implanted devices has led to new terms, such as "AF burden", defined as the overall time spent in AF during a specified period of time 372,380 381 382 ), and "subclinical AF", corresponding to episodes of atrial tachyarrhythmias with duration between 5 min and 24 h, detected by a CIED in patients without clinical history or clinical symptoms of AF 371,375,376,383,384 . The prevalence of AHRE, often reported as AF burden, among patients implanted with CIEDs varies, depending on underlying heart disease, periods of observation, and above all previous history of clinically overt atrial tachyarrhythmias, including AF. In the ASSERT study, subclinical atrial tachyarrhythmias with at least 6 min duration were detected within 3 months in around 10% of patients implanted with a CIED 375 . During a follow-up period of 2.5 years, additional subclinical atrial tachyarrhythmias occurred in approximately 25% of patients, and around 16% of those who had subclinical atrial tachyarrhythmias developed symptomatic AF 375 . Considering these findings, as well as data from the literature reported in e-Table 20, there is evidence that AHREs with a duration &gt;5-6 min are common in patients implanted with CIEDs. In patients implanted with CIEDs for conventional indications, AHREs, with a short duration, ranging from three atrial premature complexes to 15-20 s, are currently considered of no specific clinical significance since this type of AHRE was found not to be significantly associated with episodes of longer duration, or with an increased risk of stroke or systemic thromboembolism 385 . For this reason most of the interest is patient with CIEDs is focused on AHRE with a duration ≥5-6 min, a finding associated with a substantial risk of subsequently presenting clinical AF (HR 5.5-6.0), initially reported by the ancillary MOST analysis 386 and then by the ASSERT study 375 , where a CIEDdetected AHREs &gt;6 min were followed by clinical AF detected by a surface ECG in approximately 16% of patients at 2.5 years of follow-up (e-Table 21). The association between CIED-detected atrial tachyarrhythmias of variable durations and stroke or systemic thromboembolism has been evaluated by several studies that overall collected data on &gt;22,000 patients, taking into account the maximum duration of AHRE episode, or the maximum daily AF burden (that is, the maximum time spent in adjudicated AF in one day of the follow-up 375,[385][386][387][388][389][390][391][392][393] . The studies show that AHRE burden with a duration ≥5-6 min are significantly associated with an increase in the risk of stroke or systemic thromboembolism (HR 2-9). In a reanalysis of the ASSERT study 394 , the increase in the risk of stroke occurred only when the longest duration of the various episodes of detected AHREs was &gt;24 h. The largest dataset of patients with CIED-detected AHREs was analysed in the SOS AF project, with a pooling of three prospective studies (PANORAMA, Italian Clinical Services Project, and TRENDS) resulting in 10,016 patients 391 . During a median follow-up of 24 months, 43% of an unselected cohort of patients with implanted devices experienced ≥1 day with ≥5 min of AHRE burden and a 1-h threshold of AHRE burden was associated with a hazard ratio for ischemic stroke of 2.11 (95% CI 1.22-3.64, P = 0.008), although the absolute risk of ischemic stroke in patients with AHREs was low (0.39% annual rate in the whole cohort). Similarly, the TRENDS study 389 found that an AHRE burden of 5.5 h in a day, in a 30-day period, was associated with a two-fold increase in the adjusted risk of stroke (absolute risk of thromboembolism around 1.8% per year) 389 . Integration of AHRE presence, duration, or burden (≥5 min or ≥24 h) into risk scores for thromboembolism may modestly improve c-statistics of both the CHADS 2 and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scores for predicting stroke 395 . The clinical significance of AHRE is presumably different from that of clinically identified AF since the latter, detected using conventional surface ECG methods corresponds to a much higher AF burden as compared to patients with AHRE detected by continuous monitoring via a CIED 374,376 . The actual rates of stroke or systemic embolic events reported in studies evaluating CIED-detected AHREs are often lower than what would be predicted by CHADS 2 and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scores and this may be related to concurrent treatment with oral anticoagulants in each study, risk of under-reporting and confounding. Also, the temporal relationship between ischemic stroke and AF is less strict than expected, since stroke may occur without the concurrent presence of atrial tachyarrhythmias or AF at the time of stroke or in the days before. These findings suggest that the relationship between AF and stroke can be complex, with AF involved but not always in a causative role (mediated by a left atrial thrombus), but also simply representing a marker of increased vascular risk 372,376 . Two randomized controlled trials are ongoing evaluating the efficacy and risk-benefit ratio of oral anticoagulation to no oral anticoagulation (aspirin only) in patients with CIED-detected AHRE (ARTESiA (NCT01938248) 396 and NOAH -AFNET 6 (NCT02618577). 397 In the absence of the results of these on-going trials, management of patients with CIEDs-detected AHREs requires cardiological clinical evaluation, clinical decision making and follow up (Figure 7). Oral anticoagulants could be considered as a result of an individualized clinical assessment taking into account overall AHRE burden (in the range of multiple hours rather than few minutes) and specifically presence of AHRE &gt; 24 hours, individual stroke risk (CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc), predicted risk benefit of oral anticoagulation (specifically risk of major bleeding) and informed patient preferences.</p>
        <p>The risk of thromboembolism and stroke in patients with atrial flutter has been evaluated in relatively few studies compared to AF. However, patients with atrial flutter frequently present phases of AF alternated with phases of classical flutter or regular atrial rhythm [398][399][400] . A systematic review on the thromboembolic risk associated with atrial flutter, including 52 articles, found that thromboembolic event rates after cardioversion, varied from 0% to 6% with a follow-up from 1 week to 6 years. 235,273,275,276,[401][402][403][404][405][406][407][408][409][410][411] Echocardiographic studies reported prevalence of intra-atrial thrombi from 0% to 38% and a prevalence of spontaneous echo contrast up to 28%. 398,399,409,[412][413][414][415][416][417][418][419][420][421] One ablation study in non-anticoagulated patients with atrial flutter reported thromboembolic events in 13.9% of cases. 422 The differences in patient selection, type of study and, importantly, use of oral anticoagulation explain the heterogeneity of reported data with regard to echo findings and thromboembolic complications. Observational studies demonstrated an increased risk of stroke (risk ratio 1.4, 95% CI 1.35 to 1.46) and death (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2 to 3. ). 401 The role of anticoagulant therapy for patients with atrial flutter has not been evaluated in large randomized clinical trials, but because these patients often have concomitant AF or are at increased risk of developing AF, it is reasonable to base decisions regarding antithrombotic therapy on the same risk stratification schemes and scores used for AF. 423 Recommendation.</p>
        <p>For patients with atrial flutter, we suggest that antithrombotic therapy decisions follow the same risk-based recommendations as for AF. (ungraded consensus-based statement).</p>
        <p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter are very rare during pregnancy, unless when there is an underlying structural heart disease or hyperthyroidism. 424 Lone AF is uncommon in pregnancy and is associated with older age and late pregnancy. 425 In countries where the prevalence of rheumatic heart disease is still high or among immigrants from these areas to Western countries the prevalence of AF in pregnancy may be commonly related to rheumatic heart disease. 425 Peri-partum cardiomyopathy AF is common, with a prevalence that may reach 10%, and may severely impair hemodynamic status. 426 In a registry of &gt;250, 000 pregnancies in Southern California 427 AF was evident in 0.6 per 1000, more frequently in white women (1,1 per 1000 pregnancies), and was associated with more advanced age, higher BMI, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. Decision-making on antithrombotic therapy during pregnancy has been reviewed in detail in the 9 th Edition of the Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention Guidelines; here we provide an update with recommendations focused on AF. 428 The use of anticoagulant therapy during pregnancy is challenging because of the potential for both fetal and maternal complications. Pregnancy-induced changes in hemostasis lead to a state of hypercoagulability, so in a women with AF at risk of stroke/thromboembolism in the non-pregnant state, pregnancy will increase this risk 3-to 4-fold. 428,429 Vitamin K antagonists cross the placenta and have the potential to cause fetal wastage, bleeding in the fetus, and teratogenicity. The most common fetal anomaly developing as a consequence of fetal exposure to warfarin consists of midfacial hypoplasia and stippled epiphyses and typically occurs after in utero exposure to vitamin K antagonists during the first trimester of pregnancy 428 . Vitamin K antagonists have also been associated with central nervous system abnormalities after exposure during any trimester, but these complications are uncommon. 428 There is general consensus that in order to minimize the risk of warfarin embryopathy it is reasonable to avoid warfarin between weeks 6 and 12 of gestation because of the high risk of fetal defects, especially if the dose of warfarin is higher than 5 mg per day. 424</p>
        <p>LMWH does not cross the placenta and there is no evidence that LMWH causes teratogenicity or increases fetal bleeding. Because of accelerated clearance, LMWH has a shorter half-life and lower peak plasma concentration during pregnancy thus potentially requiring higher doses. For this reason, use of LMWH (such as between weeks 6 and 12) has to be managed with dose adjustment according to weight and target anti-Xa level (4-6 hours post-dose 0.8-1.2 U/mL). Unfractionated heparin (UFH) does not cross the placenta and therefore can be safely used in pregnancy. However, it carries some risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and osteopenia, which may lead to symptomatic vertebral fracture in approximately 2% of women 428 . Moreover, the pharmacokinetic changes of pregnancy result in a shorter half-life and lower peak plasma concentration of heparin compounds, with the need to titrate doses in order to keep the midinterval aPTT (6 hours post dose ≥ twice control values. Since both the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and the risk of osteoporosis are lower with LMWH than with UFH, the former is preferred as subcutaneous treatment during pregnancy. Pregnant women were excluded from participating in clinical trials evaluating NOACs. Given the rather low molecular weight of NOACs and data on placental transfer in rats, all NOACs are expected to cross the placenta. 430 Hence, use of NOACs in pregnancy should be avoided. Limited data are available on the consequences of exposure to NOACs but women inadvertently exposed to a NOAC in early pregnancy before diagnosis of pregnancy) can be reassured, since the risk of embryopathy seems low. In case of planned pregnancy, avoidance of NOACs should be considered (with switching to LMWH). With regard to breast-feeding, warfarin, in view of its characteristics (polar, non-lipophilic, and highly protein bound) can be considered safe since two reports showed that warfarin is not detected in breast milk and does not induce an anticoagulant effect in the breast-fed infant when nursing mothers consume the drug. 431,432 Acenocoumarol, which is commonly used in Europe, has similar properties. 433,434 Use of UFH and LMWH in breast-feeding women appears safe. No clinical data on the effect of NOACs on breast-fed infants are available and therefore the recommendation is against use these medications in breast-feeding women.</p>
        <p>A flow chart on how to manage women with AF during pregnancy is shown in Remark: For women on treatment with a NOAC we suggest switching to vitamin K antagonists, rather than switching to LMWH while aƩempƟng pregnancy.¬ † 48. For lactating women using warfarin, acenocoumarol, or UFH who wish to breastfeed, we suggest continuing the use of warfarin, acenocoumarol, LMWH or UFH (ungraded consensusbased statement) 49. For breast-feeding women, we suggest alternative anticoagulants rather than NOACs (ungraded consensus-based statement).</p>
        <p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is frequently present in patients with AF and has significant implications on the trajectory of AF, risk of stroke, and bleeding risk of anticoagulation. The presence of CKD or AF bi-directionally affects the incident risk of the other. Among patients with CKD, the prevalence of AF is substantially higher than in the general population, ranging from 16-21% in nondialysis dependent CKD and 15-40% in patients on dialysis 435 . Among patients with AF, CKD is present in one-third of patients at the time of AF diagnosis 51 436 although this may be substantially higher among cohorts of prevalent AF subjects. The impact of AF is illustrated in the systematic review by Odutayo et al 51 435 . The pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for stroke and systemic embolism in these patients are multifactorial. The precise attributable risk of AF as a causal agent of cardioembolic stroke is therefore unclear, particularly where patients have substantially higher risk of atherothrombotic ischemic stroke due to hypertension, intracranial and carotid atherosclerosis, heart failure, and CAD.</p>
        <p>Second, CKD increases the competing risk of death from causes unrelated to AF-associated stroke and may attenuate expected benefit of stroke prevention therapy. In a recent analysis of seven risk stratification scores, all had substantially poorer discrimination in CKD patients than those without CKD (c-statistics 0.50-59 vs. 0.69-0.70, respectively), and inclusion of CKD stage did not improve calibration or discrimination 437 . One study from Taiwan showed that the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score could adequately risk stratify for ischemic stroke amongst a haemodialysis population (c-index 0.682, superior to CHADS 2 ) 438 . Third, moderate to severe CKD increases the risk of major and intracranial bleeding through a number of mechanisms, and the risk may be further increased by the use of oral anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy. The clinical bleeding risk scores (e.g., HAS-BLED, ORBIT, ATRIA) all include CKD measures as part of their score calculation 104 . Therefore, CKD is both a marker of risk of disease and of its therapy, and there is significant controversy as to the net clinical benefit of oral anticoagulation in severe CKD despite encouraging observational studies 439 . Fourth, there are virtually no randomized trial data of oral anticoagulation in severe CKD (creatinine clearance &lt; 25-30 ml/min). Some observational data suggest that warfarin may be harmful in end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on haemodialysis, with no reduction (or an increase) in stroke and an excess of major bleeding; however, many of these studies (largely from North America) do not report quality of anticoagulation control, as reflected by time in therapeutic range (TTR) [440][441][442] .. In contrast, European data suggest that there is a beneficial reduction in ischemic stroke which outweighs the increase in severe bleeding, where TTR is good &gt;65-70% [440][441][442] . The latest systematic review and meta-analysis by Harel et al 443 23). They concluded that warfarin was not associated with a clear benefit or harm among patients who have AF and receive dialysis. However, there was marked study heterogeneity including the inability to account for major confounders such as the quality of anticoagulation control (TTR). One study reported that in AF patients on peritoneal dialysis, warfarin reduced stroke and thromboembolism compared to aspirin or no antithrombotic therapy, with no excess in serious bleeds (ICH) 247 .</p>
        <p>The lack of clinical trial data in severe CKD is a major evidence gap with the NOACs, even though some regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration have approved reduced-dosed NOACs for severe CKD and dialysis on the basis of pharmacokinetic data 444 . Fortunately, the pivotal NOAC randomized trials have demonstrated non-inferiority of NOACs to warfarin among patients with creatinine clearance of 30-50 ml/min (and for apixaban 25-50 ml/min) 246 .</p>
        <p>All the NOACs have some degree of renal elimination, Cmax, and half-life, with the greatest renal dependency for excretion with dabigatran (80%) and the least with renal dependency for apixaban (27%). However, there are no head-to-head NOAC trials and therefore insufficient evidence to recommend one agent over another. Given these limitations, treatment should be individualized and the dose adapted on the basis of creatine-clearance according to licensed indications [see Figure 9].</p>
        <p>A recent physician survey 445 reported marked heterogeneity in the definition of valvular and nonvalvular AF and variable management strategies, including NOACs in patients with valvular heart disease (VHD) other than prosthetic heart valves or hemodynamically significant mitral stenosis. Whilst hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is sometimes discussed in association with valvular AF, this will not be addressed in this section; specific guidelines on this condition are available 446 . The use of the term non-valvular AF is unfortunate and misleading as patients with a wide range of valvular pathology and severity were enrolled in all of the phase 3 NOAC trials. The only VHD uniformly excluded from all the NOAC trials were significant (moderate or severe) mitral stenosis and mechanical heart valves.</p>
        <p>A meta-analysis of the four phase 3 AF trials comparing NOAC with warfarin found that although patients with VHD at higher risk compared with those without valvular disease, the efficacy and safety of NOACs versus warfarin is consistent in regardless of the presence or absence of VHD 240 . AF patients with mechanical heart valves should only be prescribed VKAs. Data from the only phase II trial of a NOAC, dabigatran, in patients with mechanical heart valves (RE-ALIGN trial) demonstrated inferior efficacy and more bleeding 447 . However,patients with bioprosthetic valves were included in the ARISTOTLE trial 448 (apixban) the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial 449 (edoxaban) and the relative efficacy and safety of NOACs compared with warfarin was consistent in these patients, although the number of patients with bioprosthetic valves was limited (&lt;300).</p>
        <p>In keeping with a recent European consensus document, with endorsement by international learned societies, we propose that the term 'valvular AF' is outdated. Given that any definition ultimately relates to the evaluated practical use of oral</p>
        <p>Approximately 90% of the thrombi found in patients with non-valvular AF and 57% of the thrombi found in valvular AF are located in the LAA 452 .</p>
        <p>Left atrial appendage occlusion using specific percutaneous devices (WATCHMAN, Amplatzer Cardiac Plug, or WaveCrest device or the Lariat endocardial and epicardial ligation technique) or occlusion during a cardiac surgery procedure with either LAA amputation and closure or a stapler device have been proposed and tested for patients with AF at high risk of stroke in the presence of an high risk of bleeding or in the presence of contraindications to OACs. Two randomized studies evaluated the WATCHMAN (Atritech, Inc) device versus warfarin, the PROTECT-AF and the PREVAIL AF trials [453][454][455][456][457][458][459] . In the PROTECT AF trial the efficacy of LAA closure with the device met the pre-specified criteria for non-inferiority vs. warfarin, but the rate of adverse safety events in the intervention group was 4.4% with evidence of harmful periprocedural complications (pericardial effusion and procedure-related ischemic stroke). For acute complications a "learning curve" appeared to be present, with serious pericardial effusions (requiring drainage) in 7.1% of the first 3 implant patients at each site compared with 4.4% of subsequent patients 460 . The serious complication rate of around 7%, has been reported also for first or second generation Amplatzer occluders 461,462 . A recent systematic review network meta-analysis on the use of oral anticoagulants and Watchman device showed that the use of VKA, NOAC and the Watchman device significantly reduce the risk of any stroke and systemic embolism as compared to placebo/control (Watchman Device OR, 95% CI: 0.35, 0.16-0.80). 463 Data on the use of the WATCHMAN device in patients with contraindications to anticoagulation are very limited and DAPT is needed for at least 6 weeks after the procedure, potentially exposing the patient to increased risk of bleeding, 460 . The Lariat device is based on an epicardial snare that requires positioning using a percutaneous approach to the epicardium through a pericardial access and in combination a percutaneous endocardial approach. In inexperienced operators incomplete occlusion of the LAA after LARIAT ligation was relatively common (20% of cases) and was associated with risk of thromboembolic events 464 . No randomized controlled study comparing this device with oral anticoagulation is currently available. In addition, the role of LAAO devices in AF patients has also to consider that no trials are available comparing these devices with NOACs. Thrombus formation on LAAO devices is also not uncommon (as high as 7.2%/year) and are associated with a risk of ischemic stroke during follow-up 465,466 . Different surgical techniques have been applied for surgical exclusion of LAA (simple suture ligation, over-sewing of the LAA base without excision, appendage excision or amputation, surgical stapling) but data on TEE during follow-up suggest incomplete occlusion in up to 60% of subjects 467,468 . These observations and the lack of a clear benefit on stroke prevention evident from a RCT indicate that in patients with AF these surgical techniques do not currently allow avoidance or interruption of oral anticoagulation in patients at risk of stroke 469,470 .</p>
        <p>Remark: When taking into account LAAO as a potential option, the risk of bleeding related to antiplatelets agents that need to be prescribed in the first months has to be considered and the possibility to use NOACs. 56. In AF patients at risk of ischaemic stroke undergoing cardiac surgery, we suggest considering surgical exclusion of the LAA for stroke prevention, but the need for long term OAC is unchanged (Weak recommendation, low quality evidence).</p>
        <p>Patients with AF on long-term prophylaxis with oral anticoagulants may need surgical or interventional procedures that require appropriate management. Since bleeding risk may obviously be increased by the anticoagulant effect, interrupting anticoagulation for an intervention or a procedure transiently exposes the patient to increased risk of thromboembolism. Appropriate management requires balancing reducing the risk of thromboembolism and preventing excessive procedure-related bleeding.</p>
        <p>In the NOAC RCTs surgical or other invasive procedures were required during a follow up of around 2 years in one-quarter of patients in RE-LY and one-third of patients in ROCKET AF and ARISTOTLE 471- 473 . General principles of management can be considered, to be combined with individual clinical judgment, but they are derived from consensus of experts, since no data from RCTs are available to guide clinical decision making. The following steps are important for appropriate management:</p>
        <p>-Estimation of the bleeding risk associated with a specific intervention/procedure. The risk of bleeding can be predicted by the type of intervention and by its need, urgent or elective. e-Table 23 classifies surgical and interventional procedures according to bleeding risk as well as thromboembolic risk [474][475][476] . The direct consequence of this evaluation is that interventions or procedure at very low bleeding risk, such as simple dental extractions or minor skin excision can be planned and performed without interruption of oral anticoagulation.</p>
        <p>If the bleeding risk is substantial then interruption of anticoagulation prior to the procedure intervention is needed to minimize the hemorrhagic risk, both in the intra-operative and immediate post-operative phase. -Estimation of patient thromboembolic risk. Calculate the CHA 2 DS 2-VASc score (low risk if 0 or 1) but an additional transient increase in risk has to be considered in case of recent stroke or recent pulmonary embolism.</p>
        <p>81 -Planning of the timing of anticoagulation interruption. The timing of interruption is strictly dependent on the specific anticoagulant the patients is receiving and creatinine clearance. Important differences exist between the management of patients treated with VKA or NOACs 476,477 . The effect of warfarin can be monitored through INR, however, no standard laboratory test exists to measure the effect of NOACs. Discontinuation of warfarin is usually instituted 5 days before an elective surgical intervention, with INR checked the day before surgery, with the usual indication that surgery can be regularly planned if the INR is ≤1.4 -1.5 the day before surgery or the same day of surgery 475 . For NOACs the planning of interruption and resumption of therapy for surgical interventions/procedures is dependent on the type of procedure/intervention, the specific agent used and renal function, estimated by Creatine Clearance (using the Cockroft-Gault equation). In case of urgent surgery reversal of anticoagulation or specific measures may be required 476,477 . -Evaluation of the need for bridging. Pre-operative bridging can be considered in patients receiving VKA who are particularly high risk of TE (e.g., recent stroke, mechanical heart valve) 475 . In these cases, LMWH at therapeutic doses is usually prescribed starting 3 days before the procedure/intervention. Post-operative bridging includes administration of a LMWH when VKA is resumed in the post-operative period, with administration of both agents until achievement of a therapeutic INR. The role of bridging has been tested in a randomized trial, the BRIDGE trial (Bridging Anticoagulation in Patients who Require Temporary Interruption of Warfarin Therapy for an Elective Invasive Procedure or Surgery) performed in patients on warfarin who were candidate to an invasive procedure (patients with mechanical valves were excluded) 478 . The risk of TE after the procedure was similar in patients with and without bridging, but the risk of major bleeding was higher in those who were bridged. Thus, we suggest that preoperative bridging is not required in AF patients treated with warfarin who do not have a particularly high risk of thromboembolism and who do not have a mechanical valve. -In patients receiving NOACs, bridging is not required but bridging could be considered in the post-operative phase if the patient cannot take oral medications for a prolonged period.</p>
        <p>59. In AF patients on antithrombotic prophylaxis with a NOAC, we suggest pre-operative management without bridging (Weak recommendation, low quality evidence).</p>
        <p>Patient knowledge and understanding of the stroke risk associated with AF and the benefit of OAC to prevent stroke is crucial to patient acceptance of anticoagulants, as well as adherence, and life-long persistence (in most cases), to OAC. However, research demonstrates that AF patients generally have poor awareness and knowledge about their condition, [479][480][481][482][483][484] medications used to treat AF, particularly OAC, and do not clearly comprehend the benefit/risk associated with stroke prevention regimens. [480][481][482][483][485][486][487][488][489][490][491] Although there is increasing advocacy from clinical guidelines 159,160 and expert consensus 488,492,493 to incorporate patient preferences for treatment into the decision-making process, a patient's ability to make an informed decision may be hindered by their lack of understanding about the relationship between AF and stroke and the efficacy/safety of OAC for stroke prevention, particularly at diagnosis, when these decisions are invariably addressed. Assessment of patient's knowledge (using the AF Knowledge questionnaire 494 or Jessa Atrial Fibrillation Knowledge questionnaire 495 ), as well as their values and preferences, could be undertaken to ascertain gaps to be filled; this may lead to better decision-making and improved adherence and persistence.</p>
        <p>Patient education is essential to provide patients with sufficient information to enable them to make an informed decision about whether or not they wish to take OAC, and if they do, which OAC they would prefer. 488,489,496 Education needs to be tailored to the person's desire for information and their level of health literacy to promote patient understanding. Recently a prospective survey of 499 AF patients (with and without previous stroke) in the US found that most (87%) desired more information about AF and how to reduce their risk of AF-related stroke. 485 AF patients perceive greater satisfaction with treatment if they are engaged in treatment decisions and provided with relevant information (verbal, visual, written, electronic/on-line resources, as appropriate , chosen by the patient), which is well-communicated by their healthcare providers, 479,485,497 and updated over time. Full details on shared decision-making, patient preferences and patient education/counseling are provided in the Online Supplement (e-Tables 242526). Recommendation can apply to most patients in many circumstances. Higher quality research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may well change the estimate.</p>

        <p>1. For patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, stroke risk should be assessed using a risk factor based approach, rather than an categorisation into low, moderate/high risk strata. We recommend use of the CHA2DS2VASc as a simple clinical based stroke risk score to initially identify 'low stroke risk' patients that should not be offered antithrombotic therapy to prevent stroke and reduce mortality (Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence).</p>
        <p>Remark: Low risk patients are generally those age&lt;65 and 'lone AF' irrespective of sex (this includes those with a CHA2DS2VASc score=0 in males, or 1 in females).</p>
        <p>2. Subsequent to this initial step, for patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, stroke prevention should be offered to those AF patients with one or more non-sex CHA2DS2VASc stroke risk factors (score of ≥1 in a male or ≥2 in a female) (Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence).</p>
        <p>Remark: Consideration of other less established clinical stroke risk factors, imaging (cardiac or cerebral) or biomarkers (urine, blood or genetics) may refine risk stratification based on simple clinical factors. A complex risk schema using a variety of such data that could accurately place more patients in the low risk stratum not requiring anticoagulants than current simple clinically-based scores (personalised medicine) should be the goal of future research, but it will be very difficult to find non-anticoagulated patient cohorts for prospective validation. 12. For patients with AF of greater than 48 hours or unknown duration undergoing elective electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion, we recommend therapeutic anticoagulation with well-managed VKA (INR 2-3) or a NOAC using dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban or apixaban for at least 3 weeks before cardioversion or a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-guided approach with abbreviated anticoagulation before cardioversion rather than no anticoagulation (Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence).</p>
        <p>Remark: With NOACs adherence and persistence should be strongly emphasized 13. In patients in which LAA thrombus is detected on TEE, cardioversion postponed, and OAC continued for another 4-12 weeks, to allow thrombus resolution or endothelisation, we suggest that a decision on whether a repeat TEE is performed should be individualized (ungraded consensus-based statement)</p>
        <p>14. In AF patients presenting with an ACS and/or undergoing PCI/stenting, we recommend assessment of stroke risk using the CHA2DS2-VASc score (Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence)</p>
        <p>Remark: All such patients are not 'low risk' and should be considered for concomitant OAC.</p>
        <p>15. In AF patients presenting with an ACS and/or undergoing PCI/stenting, we recommend attention to modifiable bleeding risk factors, and assessment of bleeding risk using the HAS-BLED score is recommended (weak recommendation, low quality evidence).Remark: Where bleeding risk is high (HAS-BLED ‚â•3), there should be regular review and follow-up. 16. In AF patients presenting with an ACS and/or undergoing PCI/stenting, we suggest attention to modifiable bleeding risk factors at every patient contact, and assessment of bleeding risk using the HAS-BLED score is recommended (weak recommendation, low quality evidence).</p>
        <p>Remark: Where bleeding risk is high (HAS-BLED ≥3), there should be more regular review and follow-up. 17. In AF patients requiring OAC undergoing elective PCI/stenting, where bleeding risk is high (HAS-BLED ≥3), we suggest triple therapy for one month, followed by dual therapy with OAC plus single antiplatelet (preferably clopidogrel) for 6 months, following which OAC monotherapy can be used (weak recommendation, low quality evidence) 18. In AF patients requiring OAC undergoing elective PCI/stenting , where bleeding risk is unusually high and thrombotic risk low, we suggest considering OAC plus single antiplatelet (preferably clopidogrel) for 6 months, following which OAC monotherapy can be used (weak recommendation, low quality evidence) 19. In AF patients requiring OAC presenting with an ACS, undergoing PCI/stenting, where bleeding risk is low (HAS-BLED 0-2) relative to risk for ACS or stent thrombosis, we suggest triple therapy for 6 months, followed by dual therapy with OAC plus single antiplatelet (preferably clopidogrel) until 12 months, following which OAC monotherapy can be used (weak recommendation, low quality evidence) 20. In AF patients requiring OAC presenting with an ACS, undergoing PCI/stenting, where bleeding risk is high (HAS-BLED ≥3), we suggest triple therapy for 1-3 months, followed by dual therapy with OAC plus single antiplatelet (preferably clopidogrel) up to 12 months, following which OAC monotherapy can be used (weak recommendation, low quality evidence).</p>
        <p>21. In AF patients requiring OAC presenting with an ACS, undergoing PCI/stenting where bleeding risk is unusually high and thrombotic risk low, we suggest OAC plus single antiplatelet (preferably clopidogrel) for 6-9 months may be considered, following which OAC monotherapy can be used.</p>
        <p>(weak recommendation, low quality evidence). 25. In patients in whom sinus rhythm has been restored, we suggest that long-term anticoagulation should be based on the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc thromboembolic risk profile, regardless of whether sinus rhythm has been restored via ablation, cardioversion (even spontaneous), or other means (Weak recommendation, low quality evidence).</p>
        <p>26. In AF patients with acute ischaemic stroke, we suggest that very early anticoagulation (&lt;48h) using heparinoids or VKA should not be used (ungraded consensus-based statement).</p>
        <p>Remark: Heparinoids should not be used as bridging therapy in the acute phase of ischaemic stroke because they appear to increase the risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage without net benefit. The optimal timing of anticoagulation after acute ischaemic stroke is unknown.</p>
        <p>27. In AF patients with acute stroke without contraindications, we suggest that long term oral anticoagulation is indicated (Strong recommendation, high quality evidence). Remark: The optimal timing of anticoagulation early after acute ischaemic stroke is unknown. Early use of NOACs shows promise but requires testing in randomised controlled trials.</p>
        <p>28. In AF patients with acute ischaemic stroke, We suggest that anticoagulation should usually be started within 2 weeks of acute ischaemic stroke, but the optimal timing within this period is not known (ungraded consensus-based statement).</p>
        <p>Remark: Although infarct size is clinically used to guide timing of anticoagulation, it is predictive of a higher risk of early recurrent ischaemia, haemorrhagic transformation of the infarct, and poor outcome, so might not be helpful in determining the net benefit of early treatment. Remark: Anticoagulation with NOACs soon after stroke (earlier than 1 week) has not been tested in randomised trials, but shows promise in observational studies. Remark: When taking into account LAAO as a potential option, the risk of bleeding related to antiplatelets agents that need to be prescribed in the first months has to be considered and the possibility to use NOACs has to be considered.</p>
        <p>In AF patients at high risk of ischaemic stroke undergoing cardiac surgery, we suggest considering surgical exclusion of the LAA for stroke prevention, but the need for long term OAC is unchanged (Weak recommendation, low quality evidence).</p>
        <p>48. In AF patients taking warfarin without high risk of thromboembolism and who do not have a mechanical valve, we suggest considering preoperative management without bridging (Weak recommendation, low quality evidence).</p>
        <p>49. In AF patients on antithrombotic prophylaxis with warfarin with a high risk of thromboembolism or with a mechanical valve, we suggest pre-operative management with bridging (Weak recommendation, low quality evidence).</p>

        <p>Epidemiology and contemporary burden of ischemic stroke in AF Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the commonest arrhythmia worldwide 1 . Health systems face increasing prevalence, incidence and lifetime risk of AF, which is as high as 1 in 4 in contemporary studies in high-income settings 2 .</p>
        <p>Age is an important risk factor for both AF and stroke and increasing age and demographic change are projected to drive future increases in AF and stroke 3 . Epidemiologic studies largely represent Western countries and Caucasian populations 4 . However, reported prevalence varies substantially by world region: India (0.1%) 5 , Europe 6 and North America (1-2%) 7 and Australia (4%) 8 , with pooled age-and sex-adjusted prevalence estimated as 2.8% (95% CI: 2.3-3.4%) 9 . Figure 1 illustrates the prevalence of AF in reported studies outside North America and Europe 4 . Recent data from rural India using the approved single-lead electrocardiography device, Alivecor, for 2 minutes on 5 consecutive days found a higher prevalence of AF (~5%) than prior studies 10 . As well as regional variation, reported prevalence is therefore higher with more rigorous screening methods to detect AF, and the low prevalence reported in certain world regions may well be an underestimate of true AF burden.</p>

        <p>e-Figure 1. Prevalence of atrial fibrillation reported in community-based studies from countries outside North America and Europe. The overall prevalence is presented where available; otherwise, the prevalence in men and women is presented separately. (from Lip et al 2012) 4 Individuals with AF have increased risk of serious complications, including stroke (4-5 fold increase) 11 , heart failure (2-3 fold increase) 12 and mortality (2-fold increase) 12,13 . The Global Burden of Disease Study has shown that burden of disease in terms of age-adjusted disability-adjusted life years has increased by 19% between 1990 and 2010 1 . Patients with AF also experience higher rates of morbidity, hospital admissions, as well as 'premature' dementia 2,14 . Recent data from population-based studies and stroke registries demonstrate a high AF-attributable risk of stroke, especially in the elderly. At least one in 3 to 4 individuals with an ischemic stroke and over 80% of those with ischemic stroke of cardioembolic subtype, also has AF 15 .</p>
        <p>A systematic review of the associations of 23 cardiovascular risk factors and incident AF was recently conducted, including both consented and electronic health record cohorts of 20,420,175 participants and 576,602 AF events respectively. It showed significant heterogeneity in AF definition, quality of reporting, and adjustment for other risk factors 16 . Hypertension, obesity, taller height and coronary heart disease showed consistent, direct associations with incident AF. Higher cholesterol (0.76 [0.59-0.98] to 0.94 [0.90-0.97]) and higher diastolic blood pressure (0.87 [0.78-0.96] to 0.92 [0.85-0.99]) showed some evidence of being associated with lower risk of incident AF. Evidence for the widely-held clinical opinion that alcohol use is associated with incident AF in the primary preventative setting was minimal. Several of the risk factors for incident AF are also risk factors for stroke in AF 16 .</p>

        <p>Overall, non-white ethnicity shows evidence of association with lower risk of incident AF in a recent systematic review of electronic health record studies of AF. For African American, Asian, Chinese, Hispanic and Non-Hispanic Black (compared to White) ethnicities, significant inverse associations (from 0.35 [NR-NR] to 0.84 [0.82-0.85]). Only 1 country (USA) reported estimates for the association of ethnicity and incidence of AF 17 .</p>
        <p>There is likely to be considerable variation in prevalence, incidence and outcome by ethnicity and geographic region, but the number of studies to-date is limited. For example, incidence and long-term mortality following hospitalised AF is higher in Aboriginal versus non-Aboriginal individuals in Australia 18 . Variations which have been observed need to be validated. For example, the low reported prevalence rates of AF in India may represent under-diagnosis rather than true low rates 10 .</p>
        <p>The racial differences in co-morbidities in AF patients have been reported recently. 19,20 The mean age, sex, and prevalence of several stroke-related cardiovascular co-morbidities among different races in major surveys and cohorts are shown in e-Table 3. [21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37] The mean ages were The annual risk of AF-associated stroke in Asians is higher than that in Caucasians. 20 In the recent AF cohorts from Taiwan 29 , Hong Kong, 30 and Sweden 38 , the annual stroke risk in antithrombotic-naïve patients who had a CHA2DS2-VASc score 0 was 1.1%, 2.4% and 0.2%, respectively. The similar trends were shown for CHA2DS2-VASc 1 (1.7%, 6.6%, and 0.6% respectively), CHA2DS2-VASc 2 (3.2%, 7.8%, and 2.2% respectively), CHA2DS2-VASc 3 (4.2%, 9.6%, and 3.2% respectively), and CHA2DS2-VASc 4 (5.8%, 11.6%, and 4.8% respectively). It has been suggested that the risk of stroke starts to increases at a younger age in Asians. 20 In a Taiwanese cohort, the risk of stroke was 1.78%/year in patients who had an age of 50-64 years and a CHA2DS2-VASc 0. 39 The risk exceeds the threshold for OAC use for stroke prevention. A modified CHA2DS2-VASc (mCHA2DS2-VASc) score has been proposed assigning one point for patients aged 50 to 74 years. 40 The mCHA2DS2-VASc score performed better than CHA2DS2-VASc score in predicting ischemic stroke assessed by C indexes and net reclassification index. For patients having an mCHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 (males) or 2 (females) because of the resetting of the age threshold, use of warfarin was associated with a 30% lower risk of ischemic stroke and a similar risk of ICH compared with non-treatment. Net clinical benefit analyses also favored the use of warfarin in different weighted models. These findings suggest that the age threshold may need to be reset in East Asians. 40</p>

        <p>e- Pathophysiology -a brief overview AF is characterised by rapid, uncoordinated atrial activity, caused by: (a) a rapidly discharging atrial focus, (b) a primary re-entrant rotor, or (c) multiple functional re-entry circuits 4 (figure w3).</p>
        <p>The initiation and perpetuation of AF needs both "triggers" for its onset and a "vulnerable substrate" for its maintenance. "Triggers" of focal spontaneous firing typically arise from the pulmonary veins 41 , but can also emanate from other foci 42 . The 'vulnerable substrate' maintains the arrhythmia, dependent on cardiac and non-cardiac risk factors, including genetic predisposition, cardiac remodelling due to underlying heart disease, autonomic imbalance and thyroid dysfunction. Although the micro-pathophysiology has been relatively well-established, the epidemiology of how risk factors individually or in combination, create the "vulnerable substrate", is relatively unknown.</p>
        <p>Until the interplay of these risk factors is better understood, primary prevention strategies for AF are likely to be restricted, despite development of risk prediction tools for AF. Although currently primary prevention strategies for AF have not been conclusively proven in randomized trials, opportunistic screening is the recommended strategy to detect AF at population-level 43 .</p>
        <p>Underlying heart disease, whether as a result of hypertension, coronary artery disease or heart failure, is important in the aetiology and prognosis of AF. Therefore, it is not surprising that echocardiographic characteristics have been associated with risk of ischemic stroke in AF. There may also be a role in evaluating thromboembolic risk stratification to select appropriate antithrombotic therapy. e-Table 4 summarizes major studies which have shown association between transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) parameters and ischemic stroke.</p>
        <p>In summary, there are small-scale studies to suggest a role for various measures (LA and LV size, volume and strain) on TTE. However, there are very limited data to suggest that there would be any incremental benefit in risk prediction, and moreover there is no evidence that management (in terms of OAC) would be changed 44 . In the recent ENGAGE AF-TIMI trial, larger LV size and higher filling pressures (measured by E/e' ratio) were significantly associated with increased risk for death, but neither left atrial nor LV measures were associated with thromboembolic risk 45 . In patients undergoing transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), LA appendage thrombi 46 and LA spontaneous echo contrast 47 are both associated with increased thromboembolism, but the same limitations as for TTE parameters apply 44 . In terms of risk stratification, the role of echocardiography is currently restricted to the inclusion of heart failure (left ventricular systolic dysfunction) in the CHA2DS2-VASc score 48 .</p>

        <p>e-</p>
        <p>The role of biomarkers in stroke/thromboembolism in AF has been extensively investigated. e-Table 5 summarizes important studies involving biomarkers. Although several biomarkers of prothrombotic state and of endothelial dysfunction have shown associations with stroke and thrombosis, both study design and scale of the studies limit possible conclusions.</p>
        <p>Caveats with the use of biomarkers include inter-and intra-patient and assay variability, some have a diurnal variation and can be highly influenced by associated comorbidities and drug therapies. Many biomarkers are non-specific for a particular endpoint, and can be equally predictive not only of stroke but bleeding, death, hospitalization, heart failure etc., as well as noncardiac conditions e.g., glaucoma.</p>
        <p>The importance of biomarkers probably lies in the CHA2DS2VASc=0-2 group (currently without anticoagulation) where they may influence the decision to anticoagulate, yet there is a paucity of data available in these patients. There are several other hurdles including variations in availability in healthcare systems, biomarker assays, access to laboratories, biomarker diurnally, by comorbidities and by anticoagulation and other therapies. For these reasons, the clinical application of biomarkers in management of AF is unlikely to be significant.</p>
        <p>The disease burden-oriented school of thought states, "Research resources should not be allocated disproportionately to emerging novel risk factors that may account for up to only 20% of all strokes at the expense of researching the determinants of the relatively few established causal factors that account for up to 80% of all strokes." 55 Any biomarker, whether blood, urine or imaging (cardiac, cerebral or otherwise) will always improve on risk prediction based on clinica l factors, but this needs to be balanced against the practical usefulness, cost and daily applicability for everyday clinical practice.</p>

        <p>More recently there have been calls for a more co-ordinated approach to the management of AF, 'integrated AF care'. [179][180][181][182][183] Physicians are encouraged to adopt a shared-decision making approach 184- 186 to empower the patient to contribute to treatment decisions and participate in the management of their AF.</p>
        <p>It is imperative to elicit from each patient what outcomes of treatment are important for them rather than assume that all patients have the same treatment goals, 184 and to be aware that patients and physicians treatment objectives often differ significantly. Research has overwhelmingly demonstrated that patients with AF wish to avoid a stroke and are often willing to accept major bleeding to achieve this, [187][188][189][190] as many patients view a major disabling stroke as a consequence worse than death. 189 Bleeds, although feared, are considered by many patients to be preferable to a stroke. In contrast, some physicians are more concerned with reducing the risk of death 187 and decreasing the chance of bleeding rather than the prevention of stroke. 188,191 Physicians should note that in addition to reducing the risk of stroke, OAC also significantly reduces the risk of death. 192 However, it is important to note that preferences for avoidance of stroke do not always translate into actions/decisions to take OAC; in a study of elderly AF patients, 12% would not take OAC even if was 100% effective for stroke prevention. 189 External factors, such as negative media coverage (TV adverts, particularly in the US) can create fear among patients on OAC about severe or fatal bleeding, which may translate into patients stopping OAC or failing to initiate.</p>
        <p>Since the introduction of NOACs, 7 studies [193][194][195][196][197][198][199] have investigated which factor patients perceive as the important attribute when choosing OAC. In 4 studies [195][196][197][198] patients rated stroke prevention as the most important characteristic for OAC, while in others, the lack of interactions with food/drugs, 193 availability of an antidote, 199 or ease of administration 194 were of greatest importance. However, methodological differences between studies may explain the inconsistency in outcomes, particularly where efficacy and safety were not included in the attributes presented. 194 None of the studies asked patients to actively generate the attributes they felt were most important; all used pre-defined lists generated by researchers for patients to rank, which might have led to exclusion of certain responses of importance to patients. Further, most of these studies [193][194][195][196][197][198][199] did not examine patient perceptions of AF and stroke, or knowledge about stroke, which may determine these preferences.</p>
        <p>Only a few studies have compared patient preferences for vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and NOACs. 193,194,[197][198][199][200][201] Generally NOACs were preferred to VKAs due to convenience factors mainly related to absence of INR monitoring 194,[198][199][200][201] and a lower risk of bleeding. 201 Cost of OAC, particularly NOACs, is problematic in countries where healthcare is not free or fully reimbursed, particularly in the US, and consequently affordability can drive patient (and physician) OAC preferences. Only three OAC preference studies in AF patients [195][196][197] have examined the impact of cost/affordability on factors that were important in choosing an OAC; all reported stroke prevention to be the most important factor. One 197 found that NOACs were preferred over warfarin as their cost decreased. In two North American studies, one found that cost was the fifth most important attribute of OAC, 195 while in a larger US study of AF patients with and without stroke, 196 cost was the least important attribute. Consequently, patient preferences are likely to vary considerably based on the healthcare system in which they operate as well as their health expectations and previous experiences.</p>
        <p>Communication with patients is crucial as physicians may deliberately or inadvertently persuade patients to concur with their treatment decision by creating fear (either fear of stroke or fear of bleeding to death). Therefore, explaining risk of stroke and benefit/risks of treatment in terms the patient can understand is paramount in enabling the patient to choose whether or not they wish to take OAC. Many patient decision aids have been created to assist physicians in these discussions with patients (see e-Table 26). Eliciting the barriers patients perceive they may have with NOACs/OAC allows HCPs to give clear explanations/offer strategies to overcome these barriers and improve OAC uptake, adherence, and persistence. In addition, it is important to dispel myths patients may hold about alternatives to OAC for stroke prevention. Adherence and persistence with OAC is paramount to treatment efficacy and safety. 202 Educating patients on why adherence and persistence is so important, discussions on how to be adherent (timing of medication, frequency, with/without food, interacting medications to avoid, what to do if dose missed/overdose etc.) requires specific instructions from the HCP prescribing the medication; this could be facilitated by the use of patient education checklist (e-Table 26) and enhanced by devising and sharing strategies to increase adherence and persistence (reminders, medication tracking etc.).</p>
        <p>Understanding the necessity of OAC therapy and the potential adverse complications of non-adherence (stroke or bleeding) increases patient adherence and persistence. 203 Physician education is also important to ensure that they are familiar with the latest guidelines and current preferred AF management strategies, implementing them in order to prevent under-treatment (choice of drug and dose should be decided on the basis of patient characteristics, and to use their knowledge to inform patients about the specifics of the OAC to improve shared-decision making and adherence and persistence. Comprehensive reviews of 'best practice' for patient education for AF and OAC are available. [204][205][206][207]</p>

        <p>Remark: Consideration of other less established clinical stroke risk factors, imaging (cardiac or cerebral) or biomarkers (urine, blood or genetics) may refine risk stratification based on simple clinical factors. A complex risk schema using a variety of such data that could accurately place more patients in the low risk stratum not requiring anticoagulants than current simple clinicallybased scores (personalised medicine) should be the goal of future research, but it will be very difficult to find non-anticoagulated patient cohorts for prospective validation.</p>
