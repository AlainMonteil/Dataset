        <p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can have viral or non-viral causes [1][2][3][4][5] . Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an important driver of HCC. Immunotherapy has been approved for treating HCC, but biomarker-based stratification of patients for optimal response to therapy is an unmet need 6,7 . Here we report the progressive accumulation of exhausted, unconventionally activated CD8 + PD1 + T cells in NASH-affected livers. In preclinical models of NASH-induced HCC, therapeutic immunotherapy targeted at programmed death-1 (PD1) expanded activated CD8 + PD1 + T cells within tumours but did not lead to tumour regression, which indicates that tumour immune surveillance was impaired. When given prophylactically, anti-PD1 treatment led to an increase in the incidence of NASH-HCC and in the number and size of tumour nodules, which correlated with increased hepatic CD8 + PD1 + CXCR6 + , TOX + , and TNF + T cells. The increase in HCC triggered by anti-PD1 treatment was prevented by depletion of CD8 + T cells or TNF neutralization, suggesting that CD8 + T cells help to induce NASH-HCC, rather than invigorating or executing immune surveillance. We found similar phenotypic and functional profiles in hepatic CD8 + PD1 + T cells from humans with NAFLD or NASH. A meta-analysis of three randomized phase III clinical trials that tested inhibitors of PDL1 (programmed death-ligand 1) or PD1 in more than 1,600 patients with advanced HCC revealed that immune therapy did not improve survival in patients with non-viral HCC. In two additional cohorts, patients with NASH-driven HCC who received anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 treatment showed reduced overall survival compared to patients with other aetiologies. Collectively, these data show that non-viral HCC, and particularly NASH-HCC, might be less responsive to immunotherapy, probably owing to NASH-related aberrant T cell activation causing tissue damage that leads to impaired immune surveillance. Our data provide a rationale for stratification of patients with HCC according to underlying aetiology in studies of immunotherapy as a primary or adjuvant treatment.Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can have viral or non-viral causes [1][2][3][4][5] .

        <p>Potentially curative treatments for HCC, such as liver transplantation, tumour resection, or ablation, are limited to early-stage tumours 1,2 . Multikinase inhibitors and anti-VEGF-R2 antibodies have been approved for use in advanced HCC 1,2 .

        <p>We fed mice with diets that cause progressive liver damage and NASH over 3-12 months (Extended Data Fig. 1a-c), accompanied by an increase in the frequency of activated CD8 + T cells expressing CD69, CD44 and PD1 (Extended Data Fig. 1d-g). Single-cell mapping of leukocytes showed altered immune-cell compositions in mice with NASH (Extended Data Fig. 1h,i) with strongly increased numbers of CD8 + PD1 + cells (Fig. 1a, b, Extended Data Fig. 1j-m, o).

Mass spectrometric characterization of CD8 + PD1 + T cells from NASH-affected livers indicated enrichment in pathways involved in ongoing T cell activation and differentiation, TNF signalling, and natural killer (NK) cell-like cytotoxicity (Fig. 1c). Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of cells expressing T cell receptor β-chains (TCRβ) from the livers of mice with NASH showed that CD8 + T cells had gene expression profiles related to cytotoxicity and effector-function (for example, Gzmk and Gzmm) and inflammation markers (for example, Ccl3) with elevated exhaustion traits (for example, Pdcd1 and Tox) (Fig. 1d,e). RNA-velocity analyses demonstrated enhanced transcriptional activity and differentiation from Sell-expressing CD8 + to CD8 + PD1 + T cells (Extended Data Fig. 1q), indicating local differentiation.

        <p>The high numbers of T cells in NASH suggest that anti-PD1-targeted immunotherapy may serve as an efficient therapy for NASH-HCC. Thirty per cent of C57BL/6 mice fed a choline-deficient high-fat diet (CD-HFD) for 13 months developed liver tumours with a similar load of genetic alterations to human NAFLD-HCC or NASH-HCC (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). NASH mice bearing HCC (identified using MRI) were allocated to anti-PD1 immunotherapy or control arms (Fig. 1f). None of the pre-existing liver tumours regressed in response to anti-PD1 therapy (Fig. 1g,h, Extended Data Fig. 2c). Rather, we observed increased fibrosis, unchanged liver damage, slightly increased incidence of liver cancer and unaltered tumour loads and sizes after anti-PD1 treatment (Extended Data Fig. 2 d-h). In anti-PD1-treated mice, liver tumour tissue contained increased numbers of CD8 + /PD1 + T cells and high levels of cells expressing Cxcr6 or Tnf mRNA (Extended Data Fig. 2i-n). We found no regression of NASH-induced liver tumours upon anti-PDL1 immunotherapy (Extended Data Fig. 3a-f). By contrast, other (non-NASH) mouse models of liver cancer (with or without concomitant damage) reacted to PD1 immunotherapy with tumour regression 25 , suggesting that lack of response to immunotherapy was associated specifically with NASH-HCC (Extended Data Fig. 3g-i). Thus, NASH precluded efficient anti-tumour surveillance in the context of HCC immunotherapy. Similarly, impaired immunotherapy has been described in mouse models with NASH and secondary liver cancer 25,26 .The high numbers of T cells in NASH suggest that anti-PD1-targeted immunotherapy may serve as an efficient therapy for NASH-HCC.

        <p>As CD8 + PD1 + T cells failed to execute effective immune surveillance, but rather showed tissue-damaging potential, we reasoned that CD8 + T cells might be involved in promoting NASH-HCC. We depleted CD8 + T cells in a preventive setting in mice with NASH but without liver cancer (CD-HFD fed for 10 months). CD8 + T cell depletion significantly decreased liver damage and the incidence of HCC in these mice (Fig. 2i, Extended Data Fig. 4a-j, n). Similar results were obtained after co-depletion of CD8 + and NK1.1 + cells (Fig. 2i, Extended Data Fig. 4a-f, n). This suggests that as well as lacking immune surveillance functions, liver CD8 + T cells also promote HCC in mice with NASH. Next, we investigated the effect of anti-PD1 therapy on HCC development in mice with NASH. Anti-PD1 immunotherapy aggravated liver damage (Fig. 2g, Extended Data Fig. 7c) and increased hepatic CD8 + PD1 + T cells, with only minor changes in liver CD4 + PD1 + T cells or other immune-cell populations (Extended Data Fig. 4a-o). Anti-PD1 immunotherapy also caused a marked increase in liver-cancer incidence, independent of changes in liver fibrosis (Fig. 2i). Mice lacking PD1 (Pdcd1 -/-) showed an increase in incidence of, and earlier onset of, liver cancer, along with increased liver damage and elevated numbers of activated hepatic CD8 + T cells with increased cytokine expression (IFNγ, TNF) (Extended Data Fig. 5a-g). In summary, CD8 + PD1 + T cells triggered the transition to HCC in mice with NASH, probably owing to impaired tumour surveillance and enhanced T cell-mediated tissue damage 27 . Despite a strong increase in CD8 + PD1 + T cells within tumours, therapeutic PD1-or PDL1-related immunotherapy failed to cause tumour regression in NASH-HCC.As CD8 + PD1 + T cells failed to execute effective immune surveillance, but rather showed tissue-damaging potential, we reasoned that CD8 + T cells might be involved in promoting NASH-HCC.

        <p>We used an immune-mediated cancer field (ICF) gene-expression signature associated with the development of human HCC 28 to understand the tumour-driving mechanisms of anti-PD1 immunotherapy. Preventive anti-PD1 treatment was strongly associated with the pro-tumorigenic immunosuppressive ICF signature (for example, Ifng, Tnf, Stat3, Tgfb1), capturing the traits of T cell exhaustion, pro-carcinogenic signalling, and mediators of immune tolerance and inhibition. Depletion of CD8 + T cells led to significant downregulation of the high-infiltrate ICF signature and diminished TNF in non-parenchymal cells (Extended Data Fig. 5h,i). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), mRNA in situ hybridization, and histology of tumours developed in NASH mice that were treated prophylactically with anti-PD1 corroborated these data, showing increased CD8 + T cell abundance and enrichment for genes involved in inflammation-related signalling, apoptosis, and TGFβ signalling (Extended Data Fig. 5j-l). Anti-PD1 treatment triggered the expression of p62 (Extended Data Fig. 5m), which has been shown to drive hepatocarcinogenesis 29 . Array comparative genomic hybridization identified no significant differences in chromosomal deletions or amplifications between tumours from anti-PD1-treated mice or control mice (Extended Data Fig. 5n). In summary, hepatic CD8 + PD1 + T cells did not cause tumour regression during NASH, but rather were linked to HCC development, which was enhanced by anti-PD1 immunotherapy.We used an immune-mediated cancer field (ICF) gene-expression signature associated with the development of human HCC 28 to understand the tumour-driving mechanisms of anti-PD1 immunotherapy.

        <p>We next analysed the hepatic T cell compartment for correlations with inflammation and hepatocarcinogenesis. Comparison of CD8 + PD1 + T cells with CD8 + T cells by scRNA-seq showed that the former showed higher expression of genes associated with effector function (for example, increased Gzma, Gzmb, Gzmk, Prf1; reduced Sell, Klf2), exhaustion (for example, increased Pdcd1, Tox; reduced Il7r, Tcf7) and tissue residency (for example, increased Cxcr6, low levels of Ki-67) (Extended Data Fig. 6a-c). Notably, there was no difference in the transcriptome profiles of CD8 + PD1 + T cells in NASH mice after anti-PD1 immunotherapy (Extended Data Fig. 6c), indicating that the number of T cells rather than their functional properties were changed. RNA-velocity blot analyses corroborated these data (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 6d-f). Similar patterns of markers (for example, IL7r, Sell, Tcf7, Ccl5, Pdcd1, Cxcr6, and Rgs1) correlated with latent time and overall transcriptional activity in NASH mice that received either treatment (Fig. 2a, b, Extended Data Fig. 6e,f). Mass spectrometry-based analyses of CD8 + or CD8 + PD1 + T cells isolated from NASH mouse livers confirmed these findings (Fig. 2c, Extended Data Fig. 6g).We next analysed the hepatic T cell compartment for correlations with inflammation and hepatocarcinogenesis.

Mass spectrometry-based analyses of CD8 + or CD8 + PD1 + T cells isolated from NASH mouse livers confirmed these findings (Fig. 2c, Extended Data Fig. 6g).</p>
        <p>We characterized the transcriptome profiles of PD1 + CD8 + T cells by uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) analysis of high-parametric flow-cytometry data, dissecting the CD8 + PD1 + and CD8 + PD1 -subsets (Fig. 2d). This revealed that CD8 + PD1 + cells expressed high levels of effector (for example, Gzmb, Ifng, Tnf) and exhaustion markers (for example, Eomes, Pdcd1, Ki-67 low ). In particular, CD8 + PD1 + TNF + cells were more abundant upon anti-PD1 treatment (Fig. 2e). Convolutional neural network analysis and manual gating validated this result (Fig. 2f, Extended Data Fig. 6j,k). CD8 + PD1 + T cells were non-proliferative in anti-PD1-treated NASH mice; this result was supported by in vitro experiments, in which anti-PD1 treatment led to increased T cell numbers in the absence of proliferation (Extended Data Fig. 6l,m). Notably, CD8 + PD1 + T cells from NASH mice showed reduced levels of FOXO1, which indicates an enhanced tissue-residency phenotype 30 , potentially combined with boosted effector function, as indicated by higher calcium levels in CD8 + PD1 + T cells (Extended Data Fig. 6n,o). Single-cell RNA-seq analysis also showed that CD8 + PD1 + T cells from NASH mice had a tissue residency signature (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Thus, upon anti-PD1 immunotherapy in NASH mice, CD8 + PD1 + T cells accumulated to high numbers in the liver, revealing a resident-like T cell character with increased expression of CD44, CXCR6, EOMES and TOX and low levels of CD244 Article expression, but lacking expression of TCF1/TCF7, CD62L, TBET, and CD127 (Extended Data Fig. 6p-u). In summary, anti-PD1 immunotherapy increased the abundance of CD8 + PD1 + T cells with a residency signature in the liver.We characterized the transcriptome profiles of PD1 + CD8 + T cells by uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) analysis of high-parametric flow-cytometry data, dissecting the CD8 + PD1 + and CD8 + PD1 -subsets (Fig. 2d).

        <p>To investigate the mechanisms that drive the increased NASH-HCC transition in the preventive anti-PD1 treatment-setting, we treated NASH-affected mice with combinations of treatments. Both anti-CD8anti-PD1 and anti-TNF-anti-PD1 antibody treatments ameliorated liver damage, liver pathology and liver inflammation (Fig. 2g, Extended Data Fig. 7), and decreased the incidence of liver cancer compared to anti-PD1 treatment alone (Fig. 2i). By contrast, anti-CD4-anti-PD1 treatment did not reduce the incidence of liver cancer, the NAFLD activity score (NAS), or the number of TNF-expressing hepatic CD8 + or CD8 + PD1 + CXCR6 + T cells (Fig. 2g-i, Extended Data Fig. 7). However, both the number of tumours per liver and tumour size were reduced, suggesting that depletion of CD4 + T cells or regulatory T cells might contribute to tumour control (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b). The incidence of tumours was directly correlated with anti-PD1 treatment, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), NAS, number of hepatic CD8 + PD1 + T cells, and TNF expression (Extended Data Fig. 8c-e). These data suggested that CD8 + PD1 + T cells lacked immune-surveillance and had tissue-damaging functions 27 , which were increased by anti-PD1 treatment, possibly contributing to the unfavourable effects of anti-PD1 treatment on HCC development in NASH.To investigate the mechanisms that drive the increased NASH-HCC transition in the preventive anti-PD1 treatment-setting, we treated NASH-affected mice with combinations of treatments.

        <p>We next investigated CD8 + T cells from healthy or NAFLD/NASH-affected livers. In two independent cohorts of patients with NASH, we found enrichment of hepatic CD8 + PD1 + T cells with a residency phenotype (by flow cytometry and mass cytometry) (Fig. 3a, b, Extended Data Fig. 9a-j, Supplementary Tables 1,2). The number of hepatic CD8 + PD1 + T cells directly correlated with body-mass index and liver damage (Extended Data Fig. 9b). To investigate similarities between mouse and human T cells from livers with NASH, we analysed liver CD8 + PD1 + T cells from patients with NAFLD or NASH by scRNA-seq. This identified a gene expression signature that was also found in liver T cells from NASH mice (for example, PDCD1, GZMB, TOX, CXCR6, RGS1, SELL) (Fig. 3c,d, Extended Data Fig. 9k,l). Differentially expressed genes were directly correlated between patient-and mouse-derived hepatic CD8 + PD1 + T cells (Fig. 3d). Velocity-blot analyses identified CD8 + T cells expressing TCF7, SELL and IL7R as root cells, and CD8 + PD1 + T cells as their endpoints (Fig. 3e,f), indicating a local developmental trajectory of CD8 + T cells into CD8 + PD1 + T cells. The amount of gene expression and velocity magnitude, which indicate transcriptional activity, were increased in CD8 + PD1 + T cells from mice and humans with NASH (Fig. 3e). The expression of specific marker genes (for example, IL7R, SELL, TCF7, CCL5, CCL3, PDCD1, CXCR6, RGS1 and KLF2) along the latent time in patients with NAFLD or NASH differed from that seen in control participants (Fig. 3g), and correlated with the expression patterns seen in CD8 + T cells from NASH mice (Fig. 3h). Thus, scRNA-seq analysis demonstrated a resident-like liver CD8 + PD1 + T cell population in patients with NAFLD or NASH that shared gene expression patterns with hepatic CD8 + PD1 + T cells from NASH mice. Different stages of NASH severity are considered to herald the development of liver cancer 31 . Indeed, different fibrosis stages (F0-F4) in patients with NASH correlated directly with the expression of PDCD1, CCL2, IP10 and TNF, and the degree of fibrosis correlated with the numbers of CD4 + , PD1 + , and CD8 + T cells (Extended Data Fig. 10a-d, Supplementary Table 3). Moreover, PD1 + cells were absent from healthy livers but present in the livers of patients with NASH or NASH-HCC, but the number of these cells did not differ with the underlying fibrosis level (Extended Data Fig. 10e, Supplementary Tables 456). Species-specific effects, such as the absence in mice of cirrhosis or burnt-out NASH (a condition found in some patients with NASH-HCC 32 ), and their possible influence on immunotherapy may make it difficult to translate findings from preclinical models of NASH to human NASH. However, in tumour tissue from patients with NASH-induced HCC-treated with anti-PD1 therapy-we found increased numbers of intra-tumoral PD1 + cells compared to patients with HCC and viral hepatitis (Extended Data Fig. 10f). Thus, we found a shared gene-expression profile and increased abundance of unconventionally activated hepatic CD8 + PD1 + T cells in human NASH tissue.We next investigated CD8 + T cells from healthy or NAFLD/NASH-affected livers. In two independent cohorts of patients with NASH, we found enrichment of hepatic CD8 + PD1 + T cells with a residency phenotype (by flow cytometry and mass cytometry) (Fig. 3a, b, Extended Data Fig. 9a-j, Supplementary Tables 1,2). The number of hepatic CD8 + PD1 + T cells directly correlated with body-mass index and liver damage (Extended Data Fig. 9b). To investigate similarities between mouse and human T cells from livers with NASH, we analysed liver CD8 + PD1 + T cells from patients with NAFLD or NASH by scRNA-seq. This identified a gene expression signature that was also found in liver T cells from NASH mice (for example, PDCD1, GZMB, TOX, CXCR6, RGS1, SELL) (Fig. 3c,d, Extended Data Fig. 9k,l). Differentially expressed genes were directly correlated between patient-and mouse-derived hepatic CD8 + PD1 + T cells (Fig. 3d). Velocity-blot analyses identified CD8 + T cells expressing TCF7, SELL and IL7R as root cells, and CD8 + PD1 + T cells as their endpoints (Fig. 3e,f), indicating a local developmental trajectory of CD8 + T cells into CD8 + PD1 + T cells. The amount of gene expression and velocity magnitude, which indicate transcriptional activity, were increased in CD8 + PD1 + T cells from mice and humans with NASH (Fig. 3e). The expression of specific marker genes (for example, IL7R, SELL, TCF7, CCL5, CCL3, PDCD1, CXCR6, RGS1 and KLF2) along the latent time in patients with NAFLD or NASH differed from that seen in control participants (Fig. 3g), and correlated with the expression patterns seen in CD8 + T cells from NASH mice (Fig. 3h).

        <p>To specifically characterize the effect of anti-PD(L)1 immunotherapy with respect to underlying liver disease, we investigated a cohort of 130 patients with HCC (patients with NAFLD n = 13; patients with other aetiologies n = 117) (Supplementary Table 8). NAFLD was associated with shortened median overall survival after immunotherapy (5.4 months (95% CI 1.8-9.0 months) versus 11.0 months (95% CI 7.5-14.5 months); P = 0.023), even though patients with NAFLD had less frequent macrovascular tumour invasion (23% versus 49%), and immunotherapy was more often used as a first-line therapy in these patients (46% versus 23%; Fig. 4b). After correction for potentially confounding factors that are relevant for prognosis, including severity of liver damage, macrovascular tumour invasion, extrahepatic metastases, performance status, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), NAFLD remained independently associated with shortened survival of patients with HCC after anti-PD1-treatment (HR 2.6; 95% CI 1.2-5.6; P = 0.017, Supplementary Table 9). This finding was validated in a further cohort of 118 patients with HCC who were treated with PD(L)1-targeted immunotherapy (patients with NAFLD n = 11; patients with other aetiologies n = 107) (Supplementary Table 10). NAFLD was again associated with reduced survival of patients with HCC (median overall survival 8.8 months, 95% CI 3.6-12.4 months) compared to other aetiologies of liver damage (median overall survival 17.7 months, 95% CI 8.8-26.5 months; P = 0.034) (Fig. 4c). Given the relatively small number of patients with NAFLD in both cohorts, these data need prospective validation. However, collectively these results indicate that patients with underlying NASH did not benefit from checkpoint-inhibition therapy. Liver cancer develops primarily on the basis of chronic inflammation. The latter can be activated by immunotherapy to induce tumour regression in a subset of patients with liver cancer. However, the identification of patients who will respond to immunotherapy for HCC remains difficult. Our data identify a non-viral aetiology of liver damage and cancer (that is, NASH) as a predictor of unfavourable outcome in patients treated with immune-checkpoint inhibitors. The better response to immunotherapy in patients with virus-induced HCC than in patients with non-viral HCC might be due to the amount or quality of viral antigens or to a different liver micro-environment, possibly one that does not impair immune surveillance. These results might also have implications for patients with obesity and NALFD or NASH who have cancer at other organ sites (for example, melanoma, colon carcinoma, or breast cancer) and are at risk for liver damage and the development of liver cancer in response to systemically applied immunotherapy. Overall, our results provide comprehensive mechanistic insight and a rational basis for the stratification of patients with HCC according to their aetiology of liver damage and cancer for the design of future trials of personalized cancer therapy. 8). c, Validation cohort of patients with HCC treated with PD(L)1-targeted immunotherapy.

        <p>The literature search was done through MEDLINE on PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and clinicaltrials.gov, using the following searches: 'checkpoint inhibitors', 'HCC', 'phase III', between January 2010 and January 2020, and complemented by manual searches of conference abstracts and presentations. Single-centre, non-controlled trials, studies with insufficient data to extract HRs or 95% confidence intervals, and trials including disease entities other than HCC were excluded. As conference abstracts were not excluded, quality assessment of the included studies was not performed. Three studies 5,10,11 fulfilled the criteria and were included in the quantitative synthesis (Extended Data Fig. 10). The primary outcome of the meta-analysis was overall survival, defined as the time from randomization to death. HRs and CIs related to overall survival were extracted from the papers or conference presentations 5,10,11 . Pooled HRs were calculated using the random-effects model and we used the DerSimonian-Laird method to estimate τ 2 , and the generic inverse variance was used for calculating weights 65 . To evaluate heterogeneity among studies, Cochran's Q test and I 2 index were used. P &lt; 0.10 in the Q-test was considered to indicate substantial heterogeneity. I 2 was interpreted as suggested in the literature: 0% to 40% might not represent significant heterogeneity; 30% to 60% may represent moderate heterogeneity; 50% to 90% may represent substantial heterogeneity; 75% to 100% represents considerable heterogeneity.

Velocity and correlation analyses of scRNA-seq data: Velocyto (0.6) was used to estimate the spliced/unspliced counts from the prealigned bam files49. RNA velocity, latent time, root, and terminal states were calculated using the dynamical velocity model from scvelo (0.2.2)50. Kendall's rank correlation coefficient was used to correlate the expression patterns of biologically significant genes with latent time. Mass spectrometry: Analyses was performed using

T-test was for determining differentially (p-value below 0.05) regulated genes between all possible experimental groups. Gene set enrichment analysis was conducted with the pre-ranked GSEA method53 within the MSigDB Reactome, KEGG, and Hallmark databases (broadinstitute.org/msigdb). Raw sequencing data are available under the accession number PRJEB36747. Mass cytometry: The sample was acquired on a Helios mass cytometer and raw data were EQ-Bead-normalized using Helios mass cytometer and Helios instrument software (version 6.7). Compensation was performed in CATALYST (v1.86)70 and FlowCore (1.50.0). Debarcoding and gating of single, live CD45+ cells were performed using FlowJo (v10.6.2). Then, data of CD45+ cells were imported into Cytosplore 2.3.1 and transformed using the arcsinh(5) function. Major immune cell lineages were identified at the first level of a 2-level hierarchical stochastic neighbor embedding (HSNE) analysis with default perplexity and iteration settings. HSNE with the same parameters was run on CD3+ cells to identify T-cell phenotypes. Gaussian mean shift clustering was performed in Cytosplore and a heatmap of arcsinh(5)-transformed expression values of all antibody targets was generated. Cell type identification was based on the transformed expression values and clusters showing high similarity were merged manually. Search strategy, selection criteria, and meta-analysis of phase III clinical trials: The literature search was done through MEDLINE on PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and clinicaltrials.gov, using the following searches: "checkpoint inhibitors", "HCC", "phase III", between January 2010 and January 2020, and complemented by hand searches of conference abstracts/presentations. Single-center, non-controlled trials, studies with insufficient data to extract hazard ratios (HR), 95% confidence intervals, or trials including disease entities other than HCC were excluded. As conference abstracts were not excluded, quality assessment of the included studies was not performed. Three studies5,13,14 fulfilled the criteria and were included in the quantitative synthesis (Extended Data 10). The primary outcome of the meta-analysis was OS, defined as the time from randomization to death. HRs and CIs related to OS were extracted from the papers/conference presentations5,13,14. Pooled HRs were calculated using the random-effects model (Der Simonian and Laird), and the generic inverse variance was used for calculating weights72. To evaluate heterogeneity among studies, Cochran's Q test and I2 index were used. A p-value &lt; 0.10 in the Q-test was considered to indicate substantial heterogeneity. I2 was interpreted as suggested in the literature: 0% to 40% might not represent significant heterogeneity; 30% to 60% may represent moderate heterogeneity, 50% to 90% may represent substantial heterogeneity, 75% to 100% represents considerable heterogeneity. All statistical pooled analyses were performed using the RevMan 5.3 software. Statistical analyses: Data was collected in Microsoft Excel. Mouse data are presented as the mean±SEM. Pilot experiments and previously published results were used to estimate the sample size, such that appropriate statistical tests could yield significant results. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software version 7.03 (GraphPad Software). Exact p-values lower than p&lt; 0.1 are reported and specific tests are indicated in the legends. Survival analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 25 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).

ICPI, immune checkpoint inhibitor. A total of 1,243 patients were included in two first-line trials comparing PD1-or PDL1-targeted immunotherapy to sorafenib. In these trials, 707 patients received an immune checkpoint inhibitor (either anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1). h-j, HCV and HBV were pooled into a separate category, termed 'viral', and a subsequent meta-analysis comparing viral (n = 754) and non-viral HCC (n = 489; mostly NASH and alcohol intake) was performed (h).

        <p>Flowcytometry: Cells were analyzed using BD FACSFortessa or BD FACSSymphony and data were analyzed using FlowJo (v
            <rs type="version">10.6.2</rs>). For sorting, FACS Aria II and FACSAria FUSION in collaboration with the DKFZ FACS core facility were used. For UMAP/FlowSOM plots, BD FACSymphony data (mouse and human) were exported from FlowJo (v
            <rs type="version">10</rs>). Analyses was performed as described elsewhere46. scRNA-seq (mouse): Single-cell capturing for scRNA-seq and library preparation was described previously47. Libraries (pooled at equimolar concentration) were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 at a median sequencing depth of ~40,000 reads/cell. Sequences were mapped to the mouse (mm10), using HISAT (version 0.1.6); reads with multiple mapping positions were excluded. Reads were associated with genes if they were mapped to an exon, using the 
            <rs type="software">Ensembl</rs> gene annotation database (Embl release 90). Exons of different genes that shared a genomic position on the same strand were considered as a single gene with a concatenated gene symbol. The level of spurious UMIs in the data was estimated by using statistics on empty MARS-seq wells and excluded rare cases with estimated noise &gt; 5% (median estimated noise overall experiments was 2%). Removal of specific mitochondrial genes, immunoglobulin genes, genes linked with poorly supported transcriptional models (annotated with the prefix "Rp-"), and cells with less than 400UMIs. Gene features were selected using Tvm=0.3 and a minimum total UMI count &gt; 50. Hierarchical clustering of the correlation matrix between those genes (filtering genes with low coverage and computing correlation using a down-sampled UMI matrix) and selected the gene clusters that contained anchor genes. We used K=50, 750 bootstrap iterations, and otherwise standard parameters. Subsets of T-cells were obtained by hierarchical clustering of the confusion matrix and supervised analysis of enriched genes in homogeneous groups of metacells48. scRNA-seq (human): De-multiplexing and barcode processing was performed using the 
            <rs type="software">Cell Ranger</rs> Software 
            <rs type="software">Suite</rs> (Version 
            <rs type="version">4.0.0</rs>) and were aligned to human GRCh3863. Gene-barcode matrix containing cell barcodes and gene expression counts was generated by counting the single-cell 3' UMIs, imported into 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> (v
            <rs type="version">4.0</rs>.2) where quality control and normalization were executed using Seurat v364. Cells with more than 10% mitochondrial genes, fewer than 200 genes per cell, or more than 6000 genes per cell were excluded. Matrices from 10 samples were integrated with Seurat v3 to remove batch effects across samples. PCA analysis of filtered gene-barcode matrices of all CD3+ cells, visualized by UMAP (top 50 principal components) and identification of major cell types using the highly variable features and indicative markers was performed. Besides, pairwise combinations of CD4+ T-cells vs CD4+PD-1+ T-cells and CD8+ T-cells vs CD8+PD-1+ T-cells were performed using the results of differential expression analysis by DESeq2 (v1.28.1)65, setting CD4+/CD8+ T-cells as controls.
