        <p>Recommendations are categorized as either (1) basic practices that should be adopted by all acute care hospitals or (2) special approaches that can be considered for use in locations and/or populations within hospitals when CLABSIs are not controlled by use of basic practices. Basic practices include recommendations where the potential to impact CLABSI risk clearly outweighs the potential for undesirable effects. Special approaches include recommendations where the intervention is likely to reduce CLABSI risk but where there is concern about the risks for undesirable outcomes, where the quality of evidence is low, or where evidence supports the impact of the intervention in select settings (eg, during outbreaks) or for select patient populations. Hospitals can prioritize their efforts by initially focusing on implementing the prevention approaches listed as basic practices. If CLABSI surveillance or other risk assessments suggest that there are ongoing opportunities for improvement, hospitals should then consider adopting some or all of the prevention approaches listed as special approaches. These can be implemented in specific locations or patient populations or can be implemented hospital-wide, depending on outcome data, risk assessment, and/or local requirements. Each infection prevention recommendation is given a quality-of-evidence grade (see Table 1). Note that some of the following measures have been combined into a "prevention bundle" that focuses on catheter insertion (eg, measures B.2, B.3, B.6, B.7, and C.3). [44][45][46] Numerous studies have documented that use of such bundles is effective, sustainable, and cost-effective in both adults and children. [47][48][49][50] Bundles are most likely to be successful if implemented in a previously established patient safety culture, and their success depends on adherence to individual mea-strategies to prevent clabsi: 2014 update 755 table 1. Grading of the Quality of Evidence Grade Definition I. High Highly confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimated size and direction of the effect. Evidence is rated as high quality when there is a wide range of studies with no major limitations, there is little variation between studies, and the summary estimate has a narrow confidence interval. II. Moderate The true effect is likely to be close to the estimated size and direction of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Evidence is rated as moderate quality when there are only a few studies and some have limitations but not major flaws, there is some variation between studies, or the confidence interval of the summary estimate is wide.Recommendations are categorized as either (1) basic practices that should be adopted by all acute care hospitals or (2) special approaches that can be considered for use in locations and/or populations within hospitals when CLABSIs are not controlled by use of basic practices.

Basic practices for preventing and monitoring CLABSI: recommended for all acute care hospitals A. Before insertion 1. Provide easy access to an evidence-based list of indications for CVC use to minimize unnecessary CVC placement (quality of evidence: III). 2. Require education of healthcare personnel involved in insertion, care, and maintenance of CVCs about CLABSI prevention (quality of evidence: II). [56][57][58][59][60] a. Include the indications for catheter use, appropriate insertion and maintenance, the risk of CLABSI, and general infection prevention strategies. b. Ensure that all healthcare personnel involved in catheter insertion and maintenance complete an educational program regarding basic practices to prevent CLABSI before performing these duties. 61,62 Periodic retraining with a competency assessment may be of benefit. 63 c. Ensure that any healthcare professional who inserts a CVC undergoes a credentialing process (as established by the individual healthcare institution) to ensure their competency before independently inserting a CVC. d. Reeducate when an institution changes components of the infusion system that requires a change in practice (eg, when an institution's change of the needleless connector requires a change in nursing practice). e. Consider using simulation training for proper catheter insertion technique. 64-66 3. Bathe ICU patients over 2 months of age with a chlor-hexidine preparation on a daily basis (quality of evidence: I). [67][68][69][70] a. In long-term acute care hospitals, daily chlorhexidine bathing may also be considered as a preventive measure. 71 b. The role of chlorhexidine bathing in non-ICU patients remains to be determined. 72 c. The optimal choice of antiseptic agents is unresolved for children under 2 months of age. However, chlorhexidine is widely used in children under 2 months of age. 73 A US survey found that in the majority of neonatal ICUs (NICUs) chlorhexidine products are used for catheter insertion in this age group. 74 For chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG)-based topical antiseptic products, the Food and Drug Administration recommends "use with care in premature infants or infants under 2 months of age; these products may cause irritation or chemical burns." The American Pediatric Surgical Association recommends CHG use but states that "care should be taken in using chlorhexidine in neonates and premature infants because of increased risk of skin irritation and risk of systemic absorption." 40 Concerns in children under 2 months have been noted elsewhere. 75 Cutaneous reactions to CHG have also been reported in extremely-low-birthweight neonates under 48 hours of age; 76 however, in a small pilot trial of neonates under 1,000 g and at least 7 days of age, severe contact dermatitis did not occur, although CHG was cutaneously absorbed. 77 These findings have not been replicated in a recent trial in neonates weighing more than or equal to 1,500 g. ii. The patient is to be covered with a large ("fullbody") sterile drape during catheter insertion. b. These measures must also be followed when exchanging a catheter over a guidewire. c. A prospective randomized study in surgical patients showed no additional benefit for maximal sterile barrier precautions; 105 nevertheless, most available evidence suggests risk reduction with this intervention. 7. Use an alcoholic chlorhexidine antiseptic for skin preparation (quality of evidence: I). [108][109][110][111] a. Before catheter insertion, apply an alcoholic chlorhexidine solution containing more than 0.5% CHG to the insertion site. 112 i. The antiseptic solution must be allowed to dry before making the skin puncture. C. After insertion 1. Ensure appropriate nurse-to-patient ratio and limit the use of float nurses in ICUs (quality of evidence: I). 26,27,113,114 a. Observational studies suggest that there should be a nurse-to-patient ratio of at least 1 to 2 in ICUs where nurses are managing patients with CVCs and that the number of float nurses working in the ICU environment should be minimized. 2. Disinfect catheter hubs, needleless connectors, and injection ports before accessing the catheter (quality of evidence: II). [115][116][117][118][119] a. Before accessing catheter hubs, needleless connectors, or injection ports, vigorously apply mechanical friction with an alcoholic chlorhexidine preparation, 70% alcohol, or povidone-iodine. Alcoholic chlorhexidine may have additional residual activity compared with alcohol for this purpose. 120 b. Apply mechanical friction for no less than 5 seconds to reduce contamination. 121,122 It is unclear whether this duration of disinfection can be generalized to needleless connectors not tested in these studies. 132,133 a. The optimal replacement intervals of intermittently used administration sets are currently unresolved. 6. Use antimicrobial ointments for hemodialysis catheter-insertion sites (quality of evidence: I). [134][135][136][137][138][139][140] a. Polysporin "triple" (where available) or povidoneiodine ointment should be applied to hemodialysis catheter insertion if compatible with the catheter material.note.

        <p>A number of special approaches are currently available for use. Perform a CLABSI risk assessment before considering implementing any of these approaches, and take potential adverse events and cost into consideration. Although it is reasonable to evaluate the utility of technology-based interventions when CLABSI rates are above the institutional or unit-based threshold, this is also an opportunity to review practices and consider behavioral changes that may be instituted to reduce CLABSI risk. These special approaches are recommended for use in locations and/or populations within the hospital with unacceptably high CLABSI rates despite implementation of the basic CLABSI prevention strategies listed above. These measures may not be indicated if institutional goals have been consistently achieved. 1. Use antiseptic-or antimicrobial-impregnated CVCs in adult patients (quality of evidence: I). a. Studies have shown that an intravenous therapy team responsible for insertion and maintenance of peripheral intravenous catheters reduces the risk of bloodstream infections. 196 However, few studies have been performed regarding the impact of intravenous therapy teams on CLABSI rates. 3. Surveillance of other types of catheters (eg, peripheral arterial or venous catheters). 3,4 a. Peripheral arterial catheters and peripheral venous catheters are not included in most surveillance systems, although they are associated with risk of bloodstream infection independent of CVCs. 197,198 Future surveillance systems may need to include bloodstream infections associated with these types of catheters. 4. Estimating catheter-days for determining incidence density of CLABSI. a. Surveillance can be facilitated in settings with a limited workforce by estimating the number of catheterdays. 199-201 5. Use of silver-coated catheter connectors are associated with reduced intraluminal contamination in ex vivo catheters. 202 a. There is a paucity of clinical evidence regarding the risk reduction with their routine use or use of other antimicrobial catheter connectors. 6. Standard, nonantimicrobial transparent dressings and CLABSI risk. a. A recent meta-analysis reported an association between CLABSI and transparent dressing use. However, the source studies for the meta-analysis reporting this association were of low quality. 203 7. Impact of the use of chlorhexidine-based products on bacterial resistance to chlorhexidine. a. Widespread use of chlorhexidine-based products (eg, use of chlorhexidine bathing, antisepsis, and dressings) may promote reduced chlorhexidine susceptibility in bacterial strains. 204 However, testing for chlorhexidine susceptibility is not standardized. The clinical impact of reduced chlorhexidine susceptibility in gram-negative bacteria is unknown.A number of special approaches are currently available for use.

        <p>There are many challenges in providing useful information to consumers and other stakeholders while preventing unintended consequences of public reporting of HAIs. 210,211 Recommendations for public reporting of HAIs have been provided by HICPAC, 212 the Healthcare-Associated Infection Working Group of the Joint Public Policy Committee, 213 and the National Quality Forum. 214 Accountability is an essential principle for preventing HAIs. It provides the necessary translational link between science and implementation. Without clear accountability, scientifically based implementation strategies will be used in an inconsistent and fragmented way, decreasing their effectiveness in preventing HAIs. Accountability begins with the chief executive officer and other senior leaders who provide the imperative for HAI prevention, thereby making HAI prevention an organizational priority. Senior leadership is accountable for providing adequate resources needed for effective implementation of an HAI prevention program. These resources include necessary personnel (clinical and nonclinical), education, and equipment (Table 2). Insertion of CVCs is one of the most common procedures performed at the patient's bedside. The insertion procedure represents only one aspect of the risk for CLABSI, with the risk extending to all aspects of nursing care and maintenance during the CVC dwell time. CLABSI prevention strategies have expanded as new studies are published. Additionally, experience with implementing these strategies is increasing. This discussion will focus on strategies for engagement, education, execution, and evaluation of CLABSI prevention efforts. Published literature and expert opinion form the basis for the following recommendations.There are many challenges in providing useful information to consumers and other stakeholders while preventing unintended consequences of public reporting of HAIs. 210,211 Recommendations for public reporting of HAIs have been provided by HICPAC, 212 the Healthcare-Associated Infection Working Group of the Joint Public Policy Committee, 213 and the National Quality Forum. 214 Accountability is an essential principle for preventing HAIs.

        <p>The first step toward successful reduction of CLABSIs is to engage both frontline and senior leadership champions in the process and outcome improvement plan. 215 A. Develop a multidisciplinary team that sets goals, defines the steps in the implementation process, and monitors Senior management is responsible for ensuring that the healthcare system supports an infection prevention and control (IPC) program that effectively prevents healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and the transmission of epidemiologically important pathogens Senior management is accountable for ensuring that an adequate number of trained personnel are assigned to the IPC program and adequate staffing of other departments that play a key role in HAI prevention (eg, environmental services) Senior management is accountable for ensuring that healthcare personnel, including licensed and nonlicensed personnel, are adequately trained and competent to perform their job responsibilities Direct healthcare providers (such as physicians, nurses, aides, and therapists) and ancillary personnel (such as environmental service and equipment processing personnel) are responsible for ensuring that appropriate IPC practices are used at all times (including hand hygiene, standard and isolation precautions, and cleaning and disinfection of equipment and the environment) Senior and unit leaders are responsible for holding personnel accountable for their actions IPC leadership is responsible for ensuring that an active program to identify HAIs is implemented, that HAI data are analyzed and regularly provided to those who can use the information to improve the quality of care (eg, unit staff, clinicians, and hospital administrators), and that evidence-based practices are incorporated into the program Senior and unit leaders are accountable for ensuring that appropriate training and educational programs to prevent HAIs are developed and provided to personnel, patients, and families Personnel from the IPC program, the laboratory, and information technology departments are responsible for ensuring that systems are in place to support the surveillance program progress in achieving the goals. Regular team meetings should be held. 216 B. Focus on a culture of safety, which includes teamwork, technical processes, and promotion of accountability for prevention of CLABSI. C. Make the problem real to all of those involved to increase buy-in. One strategy to accomplish this is to identify a patient in the unit who has suffered harm as a result of developing a CLABSI 217 and then share that story with the team. D. Identify and involve local champions. Engage infusion nurses or vascular access specialists as team members. Include formal (eg, medical or nursing directors, charge nurses) and informal (eg, frontline) leaders. 218 Local champions increase the chance for success by engaging and educating peers, thereby increasing buy-in and ownership by all involved. 215 These champions can influence the development of strategies that are a good match with the unit culture. Frequent communication between champions and frontline staff is imperative if concerns are to be resolved and improvement sustained. 215 E. Share the outcome data regularly with each unit. Data can be represented as the monthly CLABSI rate and/or the number of days since last infection. 217 Consider reporting CLABSI rates as the standardized infection ratio (SIR). Displaying a trend line is also useful. F. Utilize peer networks. Voluntary peer networking between hospitals can promote and ensure compliance with evidence-based practices. It also facilitates collaboration, performance evaluation, and accountability. All can benefit from best practices being shared, and brainstorming can be done to solve shared problems. 219The first step toward successful reduction of CLABSIs is to engage both frontline and senior leadership champions in the process and outcome improvement plan. 215 A.

One strategy to accomplish this is to identify a patient in the unit who has suffered harm as a result of developing a CLABSI 217 and then share that story with the team. D. Identify and involve local champions. Engage infusion nurses or vascular access specialists as team members. Include formal (eg, medical or nursing directors, charge nurses) and informal (eg, frontline) leaders. 218 Local champions increase the chance for success by engaging and educating peers, thereby increasing buy-in and ownership by all involved. 215 These champions can influence the development of strategies that are a good match with the unit culture. Frequent communication between champions and frontline staff is imperative if concerns are to be resolved and improvement sustained. 215 E. Share the outcome data regularly with each unit. Data can be represented as the monthly CLABSI rate and/or the number of days since last infection. 217 Consider reporting CLABSI rates as the standardized infection ratio (SIR). Displaying a trend line is also useful. F. Utilize peer networks. Voluntary peer networking between hospitals can promote and ensure compliance with evidence-based practices. It also facilitates collaboration, performance evaluation, and accountability. All can benefit from best practices being shared, and brainstorming can be done to solve shared problems. 219</p>

        <p>Various educational methods and strategies have been studied to reduce CLABSI. In general, these educational interventions showed improvements in CLABSI rates; however, more study is needed to clearly understand the most effective teaching strategies, content taught, length of presentation, and frequency for repeating the program. 220,221 Both extraluminal and intraluminal avenues for CVC infection should be addressed in the educational plan. B. Educational programs for all healthcare personnel involved with the insertion and care of all types of CVCs should address knowledge, critical thinking, behavior and psychomotor skills, and attitudes and beliefs. Identifying and analyzing gaps in these areas leads to the selection of measureable learning objectives, course content, and corresponding appropriate teaching strategies. The value of infection prevention should be emphasized through all education efforts. 221,222 C. Adult learners employ multiple ways to learn; therefore, multiple teaching strategies should be used. This includes self-directed study guides, instructor-led courses, and small-and large-group discussions. The planning group for the educational offering should have representatives from multiple professions, including physicians, nurse managers, staff nurses, infusion nurse specialists, and infection preventionists. [223][224][225] The learner should be actively involved with the teaching methods, as lecture alone has been shown to be less effective with retention of information and changes in behavior. 226,227 Delivery methods should be chosen on the basis of the learners' needs and availability, along with the technical capabilities of the facility. This includes printed learning packages; audiovisual formats, such as slide presentations and videos; skills labs; journal clubs and nursing grand rounds; and computer-, Internet-, or DVD-based packages of learning materials. 58,224,[228][229][230][231] Multiple delivery methods tailored to specific problems or issues and given intermittently over time produce greater reduction in CLABSI than a single structured offering or lecture. 61,232 D. Other educational job aides should be readily accessible in the clinical setting for quick reminders and reinforcement of the appropriate procedures. This includes but is not limited to facility policies and procedures, posters, fact sheets, small pocket cards, e-mail messages, and messages via computer screen savers. 233,234 E. To enhance patient safety, learning CVC insertion techniques requires a structured educational program focusing on knowledge acquisition and performance of insertions in a simulated environment, followed by supervised performance on patients. 43,[235][236][237] A meta-analysis of 20 studies using simulation for CVC insertion showed benefits in learner performance, knowledge, and confidence. 66 Simulation for CVC insertion includes use of anatomical models and computer-based virtual reality. 238 Other approaches have tried to simulate the "feel" of tissue puncture. 239 F. All healthcare professionals should documented competency with CVC insertion, care, and maintenance before being allowed to practice without direct supervision. A standardized competency assessment checklist should be used to assess and document competency of each individual performing CVC insertion and procedures related to care and maintenance (eg, dressing changes). Competency assessment checklists should be evaluated for interrater reliability and validity. The professional performing competency assessment of the learner should be competent with the procedure being assessed. 217 Empower staff to report process defects or barriers to implementation encountered to appropriate leadership. This can facilitate rapid intervention and process improvement. Assign accountability for adherence to specific departments or functions. C. Create redundancy. Build redundancy or independent checks into the care delivery process to increase staff compliance. This can be done by incorporating visual cues as reminders for proper procedures. Implement a line insertion and line maintenance checklist both inside and outside ICUs. Consider the use of screen-saver messages, posters, banners, fact sheets, preprinted order sets, pocket cards, and the like to educate and serve as reminders for staff. 217,218 D. Consider participating in a CLABSI reduction collaborative. Collaboratives provide an organization with the opportunity to discover and share best practices and utilize comparative outcome data. IV. Evaluate A. Multidisciplinary teams should be used to form quality improvement collaboratives to set goals and identify the key factors to be measured. This team should have representatives from administration, all professions, and clinical nursing units. 246,247 These teams may represent one hospital or many different hospitals. 54,248,249 B. Evaluation involves both process and outcome measurement. 246 Differences between age groups should also be considered (eg, neonates, pediatrics, and adults). 54,249,250 C. Process measurement includes but is not limited to compliance with insertion bundles, CVC utilization by insertion site or type (eg, femoral catheters vs other CVC sites; PICCs vs centrally inserted lines), the condition of CVC dressing and timely dressing changes, and integrity and appropriate management of needleless connectors, other add-on devices, and intravenous administration sets. 43,251,252 Device utilization is defined as the number of catheter-days divided by the number of patient-days. Numerous factors affect CLABSI surveillance, including CVC type, CLABSI definition, blood culturing practices and written policies, laboratory practices, and staff attitudes and beliefs. Standardization of these factors facilitates benchmarking within and between organizations. Additionally, variations in these determinants could impact publicly reported CLABSI rates and influence reimbursement for hospital-acquired conditions. 32,247 H. Surveillance for CLABSI outside the ICU is becoming more prevalent, especially with increasing use of electronic methods for data collection. 253,254 I. Feedback to all healthcare staff is critical for the success of any evaluation program. Unit-based recognition of achievement of low CLABSI rates or the length of time between CLABSI events is a useful method to encourage staff involvement. The goals for improvement should be clearly and frequently articulated. Audit compliance with completion of insertion checklists and share this data with the staff. Other forms of feedback include periodic (eg, monthly, quarterly) communication (eg, e-mail messages, written reports) of process measurement data: posters, reports, or other forms of communication with graphs showing cumulative compliance with process measures. 245,250,255,256 acknowledgmentsVarious educational methods and strategies have been studied to reduce CLABSI.
