        <p>The worldwide burden of kidney disease is rising, but public awareness remains limited, underscoring the need for more effective communication by stakeholders in the kidney health community. Despite this need for clarity, the nomenclature for describing kidney function and disease lacks uniformity. In June 2019, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) convened a Consensus Conference with the goal of standardizing and refining the nomenclature used in the English language to describe kidney function and disease, and of developing a glossary that could be used in scientific publications. Guiding principles of the conference were that the revised nomenclature should be patient-centered, precise, and consistent with nomenclature used in the KDIGO guidelines. Conference attendees reached general consensus on the following recommendations: (i) to use "kidney" rather than "renal" or "nephro-" when referring to kidney disease and kidney function; (ii) to use "kidney failure" with appropriate descriptions of presence or absence of symptoms, signs, and treatment, rather than "end-stage kidney disease"; (iii) to use the KDIGO definition and classification of acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD) and acute kidney injury (AKI), rather than alternative descriptions, to define and classify severity of AKD and AKI; (iv) to use the KDIGO definition and classification of chronic kidney disease (CKD) rather than alternative descriptions to define and classify severity of CKD; and (v) to use specific kidney measures, such as albuminuria or decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), rather than "abnormal" or "reduced" kidney function to describe alterations in kidney structure and function. A proposed 5-part glossary contains specific items for which there was general agreement. Conference attendees acknowledged limitations of the recommendations and glossary, but they considered standardization of scientific nomenclature to be essential for improving communication.The worldwide burden of kidney disease is rising, but public awareness remains limited, underscoring the need for more effective communication by stakeholders in the kidney health community.

        <p>T he worldwide burden of kidney disease is rising, but public awareness remains limited, underscoring the need for effective communication by stakeholders in the kidney health community. [1][2][3][4] Despite this need for clarity, the nomenclature for describing kidney function and disease lacks uniformity. Two decades ago, a survey of hundreds of published articles and meeting abstracts reported a broad array of overlapping, confusing terms for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and advocated adoption of unambiguous terminology. 5 Nevertheless, terms flagged by that analysis as problematic, such as "chronic renal failure" and "pre-dialysis," still appear in current-day publications. A coherent, shared nomenclature could influence communication at all levels, including not only greater appreciation of the burden of disease, but also improved understanding about how patients feel about their disease, more effective communication between kidney disease specialists and other clinicians, more straightforward comparison and integration of datasets, better recognition of gaps in knowledge for future research, and more comprehensive public health policies for acute and chronic kidney disease.T he worldwide burden of kidney disease is rising, but public awareness remains limited, underscoring the need for effective communication by stakeholders in the kidney health community.

        <p>The international organization Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) has developed guidelines promulgating definitions and classifications for acute kidney injury (AKI), acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD), and CKD, and guidelines for their evaluation and management. 6,7 Developing consistent, patient-centered, and precise descriptions of kidney function and disease in the scientific literature is an important objective that KDIGO is now pursuing to align communication in clinical practice, research, and public health. Although some terms have been in use for decades, the increased exchange of information among stakeholders makes it timely to revisit nomenclature in order to ensure consistency. The goal is to facilitate communication within and across disciplines and between practitioner and patient communities, to ultimately improve outcomes through clarity and precision.The international organization Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) has developed guidelines promulgating definitions and classifications for acute kidney injury (AKI), acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD), and CKD, and guidelines for their evaluation and management. 6,7 Developing consistent, patient-centered, and precise descriptions of kidney function and disease in the scientific literature is an important objective that KDIGO is now pursuing to align communication in clinical practice, research, and public health.

Prior to the conference, KDIGO posted an announcement of the conference on its website, including the Scope of Work and requested public comment. 8 Attendees at the conference included editors of kidney subspecialty journals, kidney subspecialty editors at general medical journals and journals from other subspecialties, experienced authors of clinical kidney health research, and patients. Guiding principles of the conference were that the revised nomenclature should be patient-centered, precise, and consistent with nomenclature used in the KDIGO guidelines (Table 1). The discussion focused on general description of acute and chronic kidney disease and kidney measures, rather than specific kidney diseases and particular measures of function and structure. The Scope of Work developed prior to the conference contained a series of proposals for consideration (Supplementary Box S1). Classifications of causes of kidney disease and procedures, performance measures, and outcome metrics for dialysis and transplantation were considered beyond the planned scope of discussion.In June 2019, KDIGO convened a Consensus Conference with the goal of standardizing and refining the nomenclature used in English-language scientific articles to describe kidney function and disease, and developing a glossary that could be used by journals.

        <p>Prior KDIGO conferences have been evidence based, but little is known about the impact of terms commonly used to describe kidney function and disease on people who have kidney disease. Thus, KDIGO commissioned a series of patient and caregiver focus groups on the topic prior to the conference of which the results are summarized here, and the details are reported separately. 9 Also, KDIGO commissioned a survey of attendees prior to the conference, of which and their replies are summarized here.Prior KDIGO conferences have been evidence based, but little is known about the impact of terms commonly used to describe kidney function and disease on people who have kidney disease.

        <p>Nomenclature is defined as "systematically formulated names for specific entities" and in the biomedical sciences has required the ongoing work of international groups. 10 The development of nomenclature requires the convergence of multiple names into an accepted set of terms, meaning some users must be willing to relinquish traditional words that may be more familiar or memorable. Nomenclature must be consistent with current knowledge and stable enough to remain relevant for the foreseeable future, but sufficiently flexible to accommodate new vocabulary arising with advances in the field. 10 The KDIGO guidelines define kidney disease as structural or functional abnormalities of the kidneys that have implications for health, and classify kidney disease according to duration, cause, severity of structural and functional abnormalities, and prognosis (Figure 1). 11,12 A few other publications have proposed kidney-related nomenclature, [13][14][15][16] but these have been focused on specific diseases or treatments. Other standardization efforts have had a physiologic or ontologic focus. 17,18 The American Medical Association (AMA) Manual of Style, perhaps the most authoritative and widely used guide for medical writing in English, contained no recommendations regarding nomenclature for kidney disease and function in the edition (10th) available at the time of the conference. 19 Several kidney subspecialty journals have style guides listing nomenclature preferences, but these are not generally comprehensive, nor are they shared among journals. Conference attendees agreed that the KDIGO guideline criteria for definitions and classifications of acute and chronic kidney disease can provide the basis for nomenclature standardization (Supplementary Table S1). 6,7 Patient-centeredness and precision Patient-centeredness. The Health and Medicine Division of the US National Academies of Sciences defines patientcentered care as "Providing care that is respectful of, and responsive to, individual patient preferences, needs and values, and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions." 20 One of the 10 general principles recommended for redesign of the health system is that "Knowledge is shared and information flows freely. Patients should have unfettered access to their own medical information and to clinical knowledge. Clinicians and patients should communicate effectively and share information." There is some evidence that patient-centeredness is being emphasized in medical journals. 21 In principle, the terms used to describe kidney function and disease should be understandable to all, with acknowledgement of variation in the level of health literacy. Use of multiple terms with similar meaning can lead to confusion, as can use of terms that forecast the future (such as "pre-dialysis") rather than describe the present.Nomenclature is defined as "systematically formulated names for specific entities" and in the biomedical sciences has required the ongoing work of international groups. 10 The development of nomenclature requires the convergence of multiple names into an accepted set of terms, meaning some users must be willing to relinquish traditional words that may be more familiar or memorable.

        <p>Precision. A general definition of precision is "the fact, condition or quality of being precise: exactness, accuracy." 22 How medicine is defined and understood is changing rapidly from a descriptive, disease-based categorization in which multiple pathogenetic pathways may be conflated to a mechanism-based categorization that will promote more precise management of clinical problems. The latter approach, in which a molecular profile is added to the clinical and morphologic profile, has already revolutionized diagnosis and treatment in oncology. In nephrology, the ongoing Kidney Precision Medicine Project, funded by the US National Institutes of Health, seeks to ethically obtain and evaluate kidney biopsies from participants with AKI or CKD; create a kidney tissue atlas; define disease subgroups; and identify cells, pathways, and targets that are critical for novel therapies. 23 As has occurred in oncology, it is anticipated that refinements that result in more-precise disease descriptions will be incorporated into current nomenclature for kidney function and disease, rather than replace it altogether.Precision.

        <p>Evidence gathered before the conference Patient and caregiver focus groups. A total of 54 adults with CKD and 13 caregivers from the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia participated in 10 focus groups, initiated and funded by KDIGO, to discuss terms and concepts used for kidney health. The qualitative synthesis of thematic analysis from the focus groups revealed numerous shortcomings and concerns related to current nomenclature for CKD (Table 2). 9 Of direct relevance to the conference, focus group participants indicated a preference for use of the term "kidney" rather than "renal," because it is more familiar, and discontinuation of use of the term "end-stage," because it causes fear of the unknown, provokes undue trauma, implies impending death, and is obsolete. The term "kidney failure" appeared to be less objectionable, although it still prompted concerns. Participants wanted more clarity about the severity of disease and prognosis, including quantitative descriptions, with the understanding that they would need to learn the meaning of the descriptions. For future discussions, it is important to include people living in low-and middleincome countries, racial and ethnic minorities, children living with kidney disease and their parents, and patients with experience with acute kidney diseases.Evidence gathered before the conference Patient and caregiver focus groups.

        <p>Public comments and attendee survey. A review of the responses to the Scope of the Work and a survey of attendees prior to the conference revealed general agreement with the goal of standardizing nomenclature, acknowledging some challenges (Box 1). Most of the participating editors agreed that having a standardized nomenclature for kidney function and disease would help their journals, and that the language employed in scholarly journals should match that used when communicating with patients. However, important barriers to implementation were identified; in particular, several editors were concerned that they lacked the resources necessary to standardize nomenclature in accepted manuscripts owing to the time constraints of journal personnel.Public comments and attendee survey.

        <p>Conference attendees reached general consensus for each of the 5 main questions posed (Table 1). Accordingly, a proposed glossary contains 5 corresponding sections and comprises specific items on which there was general agreement among conference participants (Table 3). For each section, the glossary includes preferred terms, abbreviations, descriptions, and terms to avoid, with acknowledgement that journals may choose which of the recommendations to implement, and that journal style will dictate when and how to abbreviate terms to be consistent with nomenclature for other diseases. Examples of the use of glossary terms are given in Supplementary Box S2. For each section, we briefly summarize the discussion at the conference and highlight areas of remaining uncertainty.Conference attendees reached general consensus for each of the 5 main questions posed (Table 1).

        <p>Kidney function and disease. Attendees agreed that it would be preferable to use the term "kidney" rather than either "renal" or the prefix "nephro-" for general descriptions of kidney disease and function (Table 3,Part 1). This practice would be in alignment with patient preferences obtained in the focus groups. The rationale is that for English-language readers, especially lay people, "kidney" is more familiar Judged consistency between terms used in scholarly and patient communities to be an important goal, but not one overriding the need for precision and efficiencyKidney function and disease.

        <p>Recognition of the need for ongoing attention to nomenclature issues Noted that standardization of nomenclature is dependent on uptake of consensus definitions B where definitions are in flux or are more contentious, standardization of that nomenclature set may be premature than "renal" and "nephro-," which tend to be used in more technical contexts. In addition, it is simpler, and using a single term rather than multiple, redundant terms is less likely to cause confusion. For specific kidney functions, diseases, or syndromes, the established terms derived from Latin ("renal") or Greek ("nephro-") would continue to be used. Attendees acknowledged that English is not the native language for many authors of publications in the English-language literature; thus, editors should anticipate that discussion with authors may be necessary in implementing this recommendation, rather than simply substituting one word for another within a manuscript.Recognition of the need for ongoing attention to nomenclature issues Noted that standardization of nomenclature is dependent on uptake of consensus definitions B where definitions are in flux or are more contentious, standardization of that nomenclature set may be premature than "renal" and "nephro-," which tend to be used in more technical contexts.

        <p>Although classification of cause of kidney disease was not considered, attendees agreed that the cause of AKI, AKD, and CKD should be indicated whenever possible, either as known, presumed, or unknown, and that the method for ascertainment and attribution of cause should be specified. Cause should not be inferred only from the presence of comorbid conditions; for example, it should not be inferred that CKD in people with diabetes is always due to diabetes. Kidney failure. Attendees were nearly unanimous in their agreement that use of the term "end-stage" should be avoided for describing a defined stage of kidney disease or people in that stage (Table 3, Part 2). The rationale is that the term is not well defined or consistently used, except for administrative purposes. For example, in the United States, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is specified in federal statute as ". . . a medical condition in which a person's kidneys cease functioning on a permanent basis leading to the need for a regular course of long-term dialysis or a kidney transplant to maintain life. Beneficiaries may become entitled to Medicare based on ESRD. Benefits on the basis of ESRD are for all covered services, not only those related to the kidney failure condition." 24 In these circumstances, it refers to an entitlement to treatment for a condition, rather than the condition itself. Similarly, the term is frequently used to describe patients with CKD treated by dialysis or transplantation, and so does not apply to people with the same condition who do not receive treatment, whether by choice, lack of recognition of the disease, or unavailability of the treatment. Furthermore, as expressed in the patient and caregiver focus groups, it does not accurately define a group of people who can survive for years with treatment; it misleadingly implies that the end of life is near and it may be associated with a stigma even in people who are not at the end of life.Although classification of cause of kidney disease was not considered, attendees agreed that the cause of AKI, AKD, and CKD should be indicated whenever possible, either as known, presumed, or unknown, and that the method for ascertainment and attribution of cause should be specified.

        <p>In the chronic setting, the term "kidney failure" was recommended, as defined in the KDIGO CKD guideline (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] &lt;15 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 or treatment by dialysis), with further specification required based upon duration, symptoms, and treatment. 6,7 In the acute setting, conference attendees agreed with characterizing disease severity by stage and treatment, but they did not reach consensus on use of the term "kidney failure" rather than AKI stage 3 or use of "kidney replacement therapy (KRT)" for all modalities of treatment; it would be appropriate for these topics to be reconsidered in conjunction with the planned update of the KDIGO AKI guideline. 25 Conference attendees noted that symptoms and signs of kidney failure (collectively termed uremia or the uremic syndrome) may be mild and nonspecific, and there are no generally accepted clinician-administered or patient-reported instruments to assess them. This topic was viewed as fruitful for research, with the idea that it may be possible in the future to classify kidney failure by the presence (and severity) or absence of symptoms and signs. The 2013 KDIGO Controversies Conference Supportive Care in Chronic Kidney Disease recommended use of the term "comprehensive conservative care" for people who elect not to undergo KRT but to receive treatment for symptoms of kidney failure. 26 Attendees also discussed an abbreviation that could be used instead of ESRD; KFRT (kidney failure with replacement therapy) was considered to be most consistent with the preferred nomenclature. Finally, attendees emphasized the importance that implementation of this change in nomenclature not jeopardize the long-standing entitlement to covered services in the United States and elsewhere (i.e., ESRD).In the chronic setting, the term "kidney failure" was recommended, as defined in the KDIGO CKD guideline (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] &lt;15 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 or treatment by dialysis), with further specification required based upon duration, symptoms, and treatment. 6,7 In the acute setting, conference attendees agreed with characterizing disease severity by stage and treatment, but they did not reach consensus on use of the term "kidney failure" rather than AKI stage 3 or use of "kidney replacement therapy (KRT)" for all modalities of treatment; it would be appropriate for these topics to be reconsidered in conjunction with the planned update of the KDIGO AKI guideline. 25 Conference attendees noted that symptoms and signs of kidney failure (collectively termed uremia or the uremic syndrome) may be mild and nonspecific, and there are no generally accepted clinician-administered or patient-reported instruments to assess them.

        <p>Acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD) and acute kidney injury (AKI). Attendees agreed that the KDIGO definition and classification for AKI should be used rather than the previous definitions according to the Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, Endstage (RIFLE) classification and the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) classification, which were harmonized by the 2012 KDIGO guideline (Table 3, Part 3). 6 Criteria for AKI include a sudden decrease in GFR manifested by an increase in serum creatinine or oliguria within 48 hours to 7 days, with the severity (stage) of AKI determined by the severity of increase in serum creatinine or oliguria. There are no criteria for markers of kidney damage for AKI, as defined for CKD (see below). It is generally accepted that the urine output criteria for AKI are applicable only in intensive-care settings, and ascertainment of AKI and its severity from the timing of changes in serum creatinine level alone is generally acceptable in other settings. Criteria for AKD were first proposed in the 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline; they include markers of kidney damage or GFR &lt;60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 for #3 months, without classification by severity. By definition, AKD includes AKI, but it also includes disorders characterized by markers of kidney damage, such as hematuria, pyuria, and urinary tract obstruction, in which the rate of decline in GFR is not as rapid as in AKI. It appears that AKD without AKI is more common than AKI. 27 Alternative definitions of AKI and AKD were proposed by the 16th Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative Conference in 2015. 28 Attendees agreed that harmonizing the AKD definition to be consistent with the definitions of AKI and CKD is a high priority, and this will be the topic for a future KDIGO Consensus Conference.Acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD) and acute kidney injury (AKI). Attendees agreed that the KDIGO definition and classification for AKI should be used rather than the previous definitions according to the Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, Endstage (RIFLE) classification and the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) classification, which were harmonized by the 2012 KDIGO guideline (Table 3, Part 3). 6 Criteria for AKI include a sudden decrease in GFR manifested by an increase in serum creatinine or oliguria within 48 hours to 7 days, with the severity (stage) of AKI determined by the severity of increase in serum creatinine or oliguria. There are no criteria for markers of kidney damage for AKI, as defined for CKD (see below). It is generally accepted that the urine output criteria for AKI are applicable only in intensive-care settings, and ascertainment of AKI and its severity from the timing of changes in serum creatinine level alone is generally acceptable in other settings.

        <p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD). Attendees agreed that the KDIGO definition and classification for CKD should be used rather than other definitions (Table 3, Part 4). The criteria for CKD-markers of kidney damage or GFR &lt;60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 for &gt;3 months, are unchanged since the 2002 KDOQI CKD guideline. 29 The classification of CKD was updated by the 2012 KDIGO CKD guideline to include Very high risk Refers to G3aA3, G3bA2, G3bA3, G4A1, G4A2, G4A3, G5A1, G5A2, G5A3 (red)Chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Ascertainment of CKD, its severity, and prognosis from GFR alone, without albuminuria, is generally not acceptable. The terms "progression" and "remission," although frequently used, are not well defined, and their use is not standardized; thus, they should be specifically defined in the context of each study.Rationale/explanation cause of disease, level of GFR (6 categories), and level of albuminuria (3 categories), collectively known as the CGA classification, rather than GFR alone (5 stages used in the KDOQI guideline). 7,29 The albuminuria and GFR categories have been grouped into 4 risk categories according to their associations with risks for various outcomes (all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, kidney failure requiring replacement therapy, AKI and CKD progression), usually portrayed as a heat map (Supplementary Figure S1). 7 The guideline suggests specific terms for description of albuminuria, GFR, and risk categories.

        <p>Normal to increased GFR G1 GFR $90 ml/min per Kidney measures. Attendees agreed that specific kidney measures (such as albuminuria or proteinuria and decreased GFR), rather than "abnormal" or "reduced" kidney function, should be used to describe alterations in kidney structure and function (Table 3,Part 5). For all measures, it is important to consider strengths and weaknesses of measurement methods and their variability; the 2012 CKD guideline describes preferred methods. 7 Measurement of albumin is often preferred to that of total urine protein because it can be standardized and is more accurate in the lower range, but both are in widespread use. For both albuminuria and proteinuria, it is important to describe the methods of urine collection (timed collections for albumin and protein excretion rates [AER and PER] vs. non-timed "spot" collections for albumin-creatinine ratio [ACR] and protein-creatinine ratio [PCR]), as well as assay methods. The terms "GFR" and "clearance" should not be used as synonyms. For measured GFR (mGFR), it is important to specify the exogenous filtration marker, assay method, and clearance procedure. For estimated GFR (eGFR), it is important to specify the endogenous filtration marker, assay method, and estimating equation. Both mGFR and eGFR should generally be indexed to body surface area of 1.73 m 2 . Assays for creatinine and cystatin C should be traceable to reference methods. Other excretory functions, such as tubular reabsorption and tubular secretion, and the determination of filtration fraction can be assessed by urinary clearances. The albuminuria and GFR categories described in the 2012 CKD guideline can be applied to people with or without CKD, but it is necessary to be explicit as to whether or not people with albuminuria category A1 or GFR categories G1 and G2 have CKD. Attendees agreed that the designation of nephrotic-range albuminuria or proteinuria is important, but further specification is required based on presence or absence of the nephrotic syndrome. The ongoing update of the 2012 KDIGO glomerulonephritis guideline update may recommend an alternative term for "nephrotic-range." 30 Application to children. The 2012 AKI and CKD KDIGO guidelines contained commentary about application of the definitions and classifications to children. 6,7 For example, duration &gt;3 months does not apply to infants with CKD due to hypoplastic or dysplastic kidneys, and thresholds for albuminuria, proteinuria, and GFR differ in infants compared to adults.

        <p>Conference attendees agreed with the goal of standardizing and refining the nomenclature used in English to describe kidney function and disease, and of developing a glossary that could be used by journals for publication of scientific articles. Attendees reached general consensus on the 5 major recommendations (Table 1) and on a glossary (Table 3) that reflects the recommendations to be disseminated and implemented by medical journals. Strengths and limitations. A central strength of the proposed glossary is that it was based on existing KDIGO definitions, classifications, and nomenclature for acute and chronic kidney disease. In addition, it was developed using a systematic process, including articulation of a clear and transparent rationale (patient-centeredness and precision); capture of stakeholder viewpoints via focus groups, a survey, and a period of public comment; and attainment of consensus among attendees at the conference. Although the recommendations are not likely to answer all concerns, the consensus among conference attendees was that standardizing scientific nomenclature is a necessary first step to improving communications among clinicians and allied health professionals, researchers, and public health officials, and with patients, their families and caregivers, and the public.Conference attendees agreed with the goal of standardizing and refining the nomenclature used in English to describe kidney function and disease, and of developing a glossary that could be used by journals for publication of scientific articles.

        <p>Limitations of the proposed glossary are that it is restricted to English and that nuances may be difficult to translate; only a limited number of stakeholders could participate due to practical reasons; it is not comprehensive (it does not include disease classification, dialysis, transplantation); and further specification may be required for studies in children. For these and other reasons, we consider the current recommendations for a glossary to be an important starting point, and they will require future expansion and updating.Limitations of the proposed glossary are that it is restricted to English and that nuances may be difficult to translate; only a limited number of stakeholders could participate due to practical reasons; it is not comprehensive (it does not include disease classification, dialysis, transplantation); and further specification may be required for studies in children.

        <p>Implementation. Achieving consensus among conference attendees and publication of the conference report and glossary are only the first steps in implementation of a revised nomenclature. The glossary will be freely available on the KDIGO website (https://kdigo.org/conferences/ nomenclature/). To foster awareness, an Executive Summary highlighting the conference and its outputs will be simultaneously published in many journals represented at the meeting. In addition, elements of the glossary will be included in online updates to the newly released edition (11th) of the AMA Manual of Style. 31 Medical journals adopting the recommendations will need to determine how to implement them; this process will require education of editorial staff as well as proactive communication with authors, generally and with regard to specific manuscripts. If successful, further implementation in clinical practice, research, and public health will require more widespread dissemination and professional education. Improving communication with patients and the public will require efforts to improve patient education and health literacy for the public and guides to communication with patients. Professional societies, industry, and patient advocacy organizations will be critical to these efforts.Implementation.

        <p>Advances in research, particularly in precision medicine, will introduce myriad new terms and novel concepts, requiring incorporation into disease definitions and classifications. Although the recommendations are intended for clinical research, we anticipate that greater precision is also preferable for reporting of experimental studies. In addition, the increasing prominence and participation of patient and caregiver communities in defining research objectives and best practices in clinical care will further elucidate the characteristics of patient-centered terminology. Expanding and updating the KDIGO glossary on a continual basis can be accomplished as part of the activities of future KDIGO guideline Work Groups and conferences.Advances in research, particularly in precision medicine, will introduce myriad new terms and novel concepts, requiring incorporation into disease definitions and classifications.
