        <p>Curative treatment of stage IV rectal cancer is challenging and up to 80 per cent of patients have unresectable liver metastases at diagnosis 1 . Previous studies 2,3 have shown that systemic therapy can downsize the metastases with subsequent conversion to resectable or ablatable disease. Nevertheless, radical resection of multiple tumour sites remains challenging in patients with metastatic disease 4 . In the setting of synchronous metastases, the rectal tumour is often locally advanced. Traditionally, the preferred treatment is long-course chemoradiotherapy including 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine as radiation sensitizer, with limited effect on distant metastases 5,6 . Consequently, the metastatic disease is left untreated for a significant period of time.Curative treatment of stage IV rectal cancer is challenging and up to 80 per cent of patients have unresectable liver metastases at diagnosis 1 .

        <p>To minimize treatment delay, a new treatment schedule was introduced that combined radiotherapy of the primary tumour with a timely and adequate dose of systemic therapy to address the distant disease. This schedule consisted of preoperative short-course radiotherapy (5 × 5 Gy), followed by six cycles of capecitabine-oxaliplatinbevacizumab (CAPOX-B), with the intention of subsequent surgical resection or ablation of all tumour sites 7 . In a phase II single-arm study 7 , 50 patients with rectal cancer and resectable or ablatable liver and/or lung metastases underwent this treatment schedule. Eventually, 36 patients (72 per cent) underwent radical surgical treatment with 2-year recurrence-free and overall survival rates of 64 and 80 per cent respectively.To minimize treatment delay, a new treatment schedule was introduced that combined radiotherapy of the primary tumour with a timely and adequate dose of systemic therapy to address the distant disease.

        <p>After completion of this so-called M1 study, multiple centres in the Netherlands implemented this treatment schedule in routine daily practice, as it effectively combines local control of the rectal tumour with a timely start of systemic therapy. Although the original study 7 only included patients with treatable and limited metastatic disease, less strict eligibility criteria are used in daily practice. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of this treatment schedule in stage IV rectal cancer patients in daily practice.After completion of this so-called M1 study, multiple centres in the Netherlands implemented this treatment schedule in routine daily practice, as it effectively combines local control of the rectal tumour with a timely start of systemic therapy.

        <p>Patients were eligible if rectal cancer with (potentially) curable liver ± extrahepatic metastases was confirmed histologically and they were scheduled for the multimodality treatment, consisting of 5 × 5 Gy pelvic radiotherapy followed by systemic therapy and subsequent surgery, with or without other local treatment modalities. Simultaneous lung or distant lymph node metastases were accepted as long as treatment with curative intent was deemed possible after systemic therapy. Standard diagnostic investigation consisted of pelvic MRI for local staging of the rectal tumour and CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis to detect distant metastases. All patients were discussed in a multidisciplinary meeting with (intervention) radiologists, and medical, radiation and surgical oncologists. Clinical data of eligible patients were collected from medical records and anonymized.Patients were eligible if rectal cancer with (potentially) curable liver ± extrahepatic metastases was confirmed histologically and they were scheduled for the multimodality treatment, consisting of 5 × 5 Gy pelvic radiotherapy followed by systemic therapy and subsequent surgery, with or without other local treatment modalities.

        <p>Patients with significant signs of obstruction at diagnosis received a diverting stoma. Neoadjuvant short-course radiotherapy (5 × 5 Gy) was given to the primary tumour, mesorectum and regional lymph nodes. Systemic therapy started approximately 2 weeks after the last fraction of radiation. The choice of systemic therapy regimen was at the discretion of the local team. After three cycles of systemic therapy, radiological evaluation of response was performed using CT and MRI. In each participating centre a multidisciplinary team decided on the next optimal treatment step: continuation of systemic treatment, staged or simultaneous local treatment of primary tumour and/or distant metastases, or palliative treatment.Patients with significant signs of obstruction at diagnosis received a diverting stoma.

        <p>After completion of neoadjuvant treatment, the multidisciplinary team reviewed the resectability of the primary tumour and metastases. The optimal sequence of surgical treatment and type of surgical procedure with or without other local treatment modalities were tailored to the individual patient. Other local treatment modalities included radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and stereotactic radiotherapy. Primary tumour resection was performed by partial or total mesorectal excision 8 . The choice of surgical procedure and the use of a diverting stoma were at the discretion of the local surgeon. Treatment of extrahepatic metastases included pulmonary metastasectomy, pulmonary RFA, stereotactic radiotherapy of the lung and lymph node resection. In patients with complete response of the primary tumour and/or the metastases to neoadjuvant treatment, a watch-and-wait approach was sometimes chosen 9 . After surgical resection of all tumour sites, no adjuvant therapy was given. Histopathological evaluation of the specimen was performed by the local pathologist. Downstaging of the primary tumour was evaluated, comparing the baseline cT status with the (y)pT status.After completion of neoadjuvant treatment, the multidisciplinary team reviewed the resectability of the primary tumour and metastases.

        <p>The main outcomes were completion of the entire treatment schedule, pathological response and overall survival (OS). Ancillary outcomes were treatment-related toxicity, surgical complications, symptom control of the primary tumour and progression-free survival (PFS). Completion of the treatment schedule was defined as neoadjuvant short-course radiotherapy, at least two cycles of systemic therapy and subsequent local treatment of all tumour sites. Treatment-related toxicity was registered using the US National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 10 . Radiotherapy-related toxicity was classified as acute and late toxicity, defined as toxicities within or after 3 months. Surgical complications for both liver and rectal surgery were graded using the Dindo-Clavien classification 11 . Tumour response evaluation was assessed using the RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours) criteria version 1.0 12 . PFS was calculated from the first day of radiotherapy to the first evidence of recurrence (local, regional or metastatic) or until death. OS was calculated from the first day of radiotherapy until death or last documented follow-up.The main outcomes were completion of the entire treatment schedule, pathological response and overall survival (OS).

Patients and treatment characteristics are presented as percentages, medians with ranges or medians with 95 per cent confidence intervals. Categorical variables were compared using the χ 2 test, and continuous variables with the Mann-Whitney U test. OS and PFS were calculated using Kaplan-Meier curves. The association of completing the treatment schedule with OS was analysed using an extended Cox proportional hazards model, in which treatment completion was used as the time-dependent co-variable to avoid immortal time bias. The log rank test was used to compare survival probabilities between subgroups. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of survival. A binary logistic regression model was used to identify prognostic factors of treatment completion. All variables with significance of P ≤ 0⋅200 in univariable analysis were entered in the multivariable analysis. P &lt; 0⋅050 (two-sided) was regarded as statistically significant.

        <p>This evaluation of clinical practice shows that subsequent local treatment of all tumour sites after multimodal neoadjuvant therapy was achieved in the majority of patients, with tolerable morbidity and mortality. The number of liver metastases at diagnosis appeared to be the only predictor of treatment completion and survival. In the initial prospective M1 study 7,13 , 80 per cent of patients received local treatment at all tumour sites, with a 5-year OS rate of 38 per cent, whereas in the present study these numbers were lower. In the initial trial, only patients with limited metastatic disease, who were considered treatable with curative intent at baseline, were included. In the present study, less than half of the patients had resectable metastases at baseline and the resectability of the metastases in most patients was highly dependent on the response of the systemic treatment.This evaluation of clinical practice shows that subsequent local treatment of all tumour sites after multimodal neoadjuvant therapy was achieved in the majority of patients, with tolerable morbidity and mortality.

        <p>In locally advanced rectal cancer, short-course radiotherapy with subsequent systemic therapy can be an alternative for long-course chemoradiotherapy. A large randomized study 14 compared short-course radiotherapy combined with three cycles of FOLFOX4 with long-course chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (cT4 or fixed cT3). No significant difference was observed in local efficacy between the treatments. A different study 15 with a similar design found improved pathological tumour downstaging and better disease-free and metastasis-free survival in patients treated with short-course radiotherapy plus chemotherapy. In the present study, complete pathological response of the primary tumour was observed in 12.5 per cent, omitting surgical treatment in six patients, and a partial response in 49.1 per cent.In locally advanced rectal cancer, short-course radiotherapy with subsequent systemic therapy can be an alternative for long-course chemoradiotherapy.

        <p>Symptom control is important in patients with rectal cancer. Short-course pelvic radiotherapy has been shown to be an effective palliative treatment modality in patients with symptomatic rectal cancer 16,17 . Many clinicians, however, are hesitant to use short-course radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced disease because of the perceived risk of providing less optimal local control compared with that obtained with chemoradiotherapy. In the present study, adequate symptomatic local control of the primary tumour was achieved in the majority of the patients. This confirms that short-course radiotherapy followed by systemic chemotherapy is an effective and safe treatment in stage IV rectal cancer, in both the curative and palliative setting. Systemic chemotherapy plays a significant role in downstaging liver metastases and eradication of microscopic disease. Earlier studies 18,19 showed that induction chemotherapy can convert initially unresectable liver metastases to resectable disease. In the present study, 99 patients (58⋅6 per cent) had potentially or borderline resectable/ablatable liver metastases at the time of diagnosis. Of these patients, 60⋅1 per cent had a partial response after systemic treatment, enabling curative liver treatment. This confirms that systemic treatment can downsize metastases to resectable disease, yet the optimal regimen has not been defined. Currently, a Dutch multicentre randomized phase 3 trial (CAIRO5) is underway that compares multiple systemic treatment regimens in patients with colorectal cancer and initially unresectable liver-only metastases (NCT02162563) 20 . The estimated study completion date is the end of 2020.Symptom control is important in patients with rectal cancer.

Currently, a Dutch multicentre randomized phase 3 trial (CAIRO5) is underway that compares multiple systemic treatment regimens in patients with colorectal cancer and initially unresectable liver-only metastases (NCT02162563) 20 . The estimated study completion date is the end of 2020.</p>
        <p>An alternative treatment for stage IV rectal cancer has been published previously 21 -23 . Patients received chemotherapy followed by a liver-first approach. After liver surgery, (chemo)radiotherapy was administered with subsequent primary tumour resection. Ninety of the 129 patients (69⋅8 per cent) completed the protocol, of whom ten had a (near) complete response of the primary tumour. A disadvantage of this approach is that the duration of treatment is longer compared with the schedule in the present study. Moreover, with this approach a simultaneous resection is not feasible because of the treatment sequence.An alternative treatment for stage IV rectal cancer has been published previously 21 -23 .
