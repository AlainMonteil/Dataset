        <p>Objectives: This study aims to analyze the incidence of Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) and its components, and to evaluate the acute infection phase associated risk factors. Methods: A prospective cohort study of adult patients who had recovered from COVID-19 (27th February to 29th April 2020) confirmed by PCR or subsequent seroconversion, with a systematic assessment 10-14 weeks after disease onset. PCS was defined as the persistence of at least one clinically relevant symptom, or abnormalities in spirometry or chest radiology. Outcome predictors were analyzed by multiple logistic regression (OR; 95%CI). Results: Two hundred seventy seven patients recovered from mild (34.3%) or severe (65.7%) forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated 77 days (IQR 72-85) after disease onset. PCS was detected in 141 patients (50.9%; 95%CI 45.0-56.7%). Symptoms were mostly mild. Alterations in spirometry were noted in 25/269 (9.3%), while in radiographs in 51/277 (18.9%). No baseline clinical features behaved as independent predictors of PCS development. Conclusions: A Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome was detected in a half of COVID19 survivors. Radiological and spirometric changes were mild and observed in less than 25% of patients. No baseline clinical features behaved as independent predictors of Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome development.Objectives: This study aims to analyze the incidence of Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) and its components, and to evaluate the acute infection phase associated risk factors.

        <p>The battle against COVID-19 does not seem to end with screening and management of acute disease. The medium and long-term health consequences experienced by survivors of COVID-19, if any, are currently unknown. 1 Series have reported the incidence of persistent symptoms ranging from 40 to 90% of patients, but the interpretation of results is hampered by non-systematic and short-term evaluations, with high heterogeneity in relation to age, severity of infection, follow-up and characteristics of the clinical evaluation. [2][3][4][5] The so-called "Post-COVID Syndrome" includes persistent symptoms that could be related to residual inflammation (convalescent phase), organ damage, non-specific effects from the hospitalization or prolonged ventilation (post-intensive care syndrome), social isolation 6 or impact on pre-existing health conditions.The battle against COVID-19 does not seem to end with screening and management of acute disease.

        <p>The cumulative incidence of PCS (95%CI) and its components were determined both in the global cohort and in the severe pneumonia subpopulation. Associations between disease severity, other explanatory variables and PCS or its components were evaluated by chi-2 test. Multiple logistic regression models were built to explore which risk factors present at COVID-19 diagnosis were associated with a higher incidence of PCS; odds ratios (OR) with (95%CI) were estimated. Variables were included as covariates if they showed significant associations in simple models.

Wang et al. evaluated 131 COVID-19 patients (median age 49, 52.6% severe pneumonia) weekly up to 4 weeks. At discharge, 40.4% had symptoms (mainly cough 29.0%, fatigue 7.6%, expectoration 6.1%) [5]. These symptoms progressively declined in the 4 weeks after discharge, with only 9.1% symptomatic patients, without differences depending on the severity of the initial condition. Townsend et al. 10 reported the persistence of fatigue in 52.3% (67/128) a median of 10 weeks after initial COVID-19, irrespective of severity of initial illness (44.5% managed as outpatients), highlighting the importance of following all patients diagnosed with COVID, not merely those who required hospitalization.Carfi et al. 4 and Wang et al. 5 , reported the results of face-toface evaluation after hospital discharge.

        <p>Regarding pulmonary dysfunction, Zhao et al. 11 reported that in 55 patients, 3 months after discharge, 64% had persistent symptoms and 71% radiologic abnormalities and 25% decreased diffusion lung capacity. In another study, Huang et al. 12 , of 57 patients evaluated 30 days after discharge, found decreased lung diffusion capacity (53%) and diminished respiratory muscle strength (49%). Finally, van den Borst et al. 13 showed that the lung diffusion capacity was below normal range in 42% (40/97) of discharged patients, 13 weeks after onset of SARS-CoV-2 symptoms; but only 57% of the invited patients attended to aftercare facility.Regarding pulmonary dysfunction, Zhao et al. 11 reported that in 55 patients, 3 months after discharge, 64% had persistent symptoms and 71% radiologic abnormalities and 25% decreased diffusion lung capacity.

        <p>Our initial assessment did not include the diffusion capacity. The evaluation was designed for a general assessment of respiratory function, through clinical features (symptoms, oxygen saturation), chest radiography and spirometry, as a screening test. We plan more specific tests such as diffusion capacity and highresolution computed tomography, in a subsequent evaluation of patients with positive screening (persistence of respiratory symptoms, changes in chest radiography or spirometry). This approach is in accordance with a recent published guidance of respiratory follow-up of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, 14 looking for a rational use of resources. It is important to highlight that most of the patients with spirometry alterations in our series had a mild involvement, without clear clinical impact.Our initial assessment did not include the diffusion capacity.

        <p>The extent of emotional and behavioral concerns and general distress of those affected by COVID-19 has yet to be determined. In this sense, the reported series have shown that PCS leads to a deterioration in the quality of life in 2/3 of the patients.The extent of emotional and behavioral concerns and general distress of those affected by COVID-19 has yet to be determined.

        <p>In summary, the full range of the duration and severity of postacute COVID-19 is currently unknown. A consensus is needed re-garding when and how to classify manifestations in the post-acute period, considering many of these features can resolve with time and their prevalence therefore depends on the time of evaluation. In an attempt to standardize our current understanding of postacute COVID-19, Amenta et al. 15 propose that the post-acute period for COVID-19 starts 3 weeks after symptom onset. Also, they propose classifying post-acute manifestations into 3 categories: (1) residual symptoms that persist after recovery from acute infection; (2) organ dysfunction that persists after initial recovery; and (3) new symptoms or syndromes that develop after initial asymptomatic or mild infection. The homogenization of the nomenclature, would facilitate the comparison between future series.In summary, the full range of the duration and severity of postacute COVID-19 is currently unknown.

        <p>The strength of our study is based on four main points, which in turn are the main criticisms to the series published [6] : 1. The representativeness of the sample (wide clinical spectrum of severity and representative of comorbidity in western countries); 2. The re-evaluation time, longer than any published series; 3. Structured face-to-face assessment intervention, including blood test, chest radiographs, pulmonary function tests, and quality of life evaluation, allowing a systematic search for residual objective abnormalities after COVID-19, beyond those perceived by patients; 4. Analysis of the characteristics of acute infection associated with persistent symptoms.The strength of our study is based on four main points, which in turn are the main criticisms to the series published [6] : 1.

        <p>Limitations include possible pre-COVID abnormalities in the patients, the exclusion of some patients with severe comorbidity, the absence of imaging to evaluate myocardial involvement, the lack of study of the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), the relatively small sample size to detect minor associations, some identified statistical associations with changes in spirometry may not be explained by biological plausibility and the single-center design, as well as the need for long-term follow-up.Limitations include possible pre-COVID abnormalities in the patients, the exclusion of some patients with severe comorbidity, the absence of imaging to evaluate myocardial involvement, the lack of study of the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), the relatively small sample size to detect minor associations, some identified statistical associations with changes in spirometry may not be explained by biological plausibility and the single-center design, as well as the need for long-term follow-up.</p>
        <p>These findings support the need for a multidisciplinary approach to the care of this vulnerable population, to help better define this new "Post-COVID syndrome" and lay the groundwork to efficiently conducting therapeutic intervention studies and designing future follow-up plans. Longer longitudinal observational studies will be critical to elucidate the health consequences attributable to COVID-19.These findings support the need for a multidisciplinary approach to the care of this vulnerable population, to help better define this new "Post-COVID syndrome" and lay the groundwork to efficiently conducting therapeutic intervention studies and designing future follow-up plans.
