        <p>The advent and use of highly sensitive molecular biology techniques to explore the microbiota and microbiome in environmental and tissue samples have detected the presence of contaminating microbial DNA within reagents. These microbial DNA contaminants may distort taxonomic distributions and relative frequencies in microbial datasets, as well as contribute to erroneous interpretations and identifications.The advent and use of highly sensitive molecular biology techniques to explore the microbiota and microbiome in environmental and tissue samples have detected the presence of contaminating microbial DNA within reagents.

        <p>We herein report on the occurrence of bacterial DNA contamination within commonly used DNA extraction kits and PCR reagents and the effect of these contaminates on data interpretation. When compared to previous reports, we identified an additional 88 bacterial genera as potential contaminants of molecular biology grade reagents, bringing the total number of known contaminating microbes to 181 genera. Many of the contaminants detected are considered normal inhabitants of the human gastrointestinal tract and the environment and are often indistinguishable from those genuinely present in the sample.We herein report on the occurrence of bacterial DNA contamination within commonly used DNA extraction kits and PCR reagents and the effect of these contaminates on data interpretation.

        <p>Conclusions: Laboratories working on bacterial populations need to define contaminants present in all extraction kits and reagents used in the processing of DNA.

        <p>Microbes are the predominant life form on earth and probably have been the since prokaryotic life began on earth some 3.5 billion years ago [1,2]. Since DNA may persist for thousands of years, it is not surprising that evidence of bacterial existence (bacterial DNA) can be found in almost all ecosystems. This has become more evident with the advent of highly sensitive molecular techniques, such as PCR, 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic shotgun sequencing methods, capable of identifying hosts of cultivable and uncultivable microorganisms. By the use of these methods, it has long been realized that molecular biology grade (MBG) reagents, DNA isolation kits, PCR master mixes, and several other laboratory supplies used in processing and analyses of DNA are contaminated with bacterial DNA [3][4][5][6][7]. Although microbial contamination from exogenous and endogenous sources is a constant worry of microbiologists, it is often less of a concern for molecular biologists who erroneously assume that MBG reagents are free of microbial DNA. As such, the potential impact of microbial contamination by MBG products that can distort taxonomic distributions and the relative frequencies observed in sequencing datasets is frequently overlooked.Microbes are the predominant life form on earth and probably have been the since prokaryotic life began on earth some 3.5 billion years ago [1,2].

        <p>We recently developed and reported on methods to effectively separate mucosal and submucosal intestinal tissues and compare the microbial populations of the mucosa to that of the subjacent submucosa [8]. Since bacterial translocation across the mucosal barrier is a prominent feature in Crohn's disease [9], we sought to enumerate the bacterial load within submucosal tissues of resected tissues from patients with Crohn's disease. However, the amount of contamination in negative notemplate controls and in standards made quantitative determinations unachievable in submucosal samples, presumably a combination of low bacterial biomass and large amounts of competitive human DNA in the samples.We recently developed and reported on methods to effectively separate mucosal and submucosal intestinal tissues and compare the microbial populations of the mucosa to that of the subjacent submucosa [8].

        <p>Although largely unappreciated, the scientific literature documents widespread microbial DNA contamination of PCR reagents and several methods had been proposed to eliminate and/or reduce background impurities and noise including UV irradiation, restriction endonuclease and DNAse digestion, and treatment with ethidium monoazide (EMA) [7,10,11], but none of the proposed methods has proved capable of reliably reducing DNA reagent contamination.Although largely unappreciated, the scientific literature documents widespread microbial DNA contamination of PCR reagents and several methods had been proposed to eliminate and/or reduce background impurities and noise including UV irradiation, restriction endonuclease and DNAse digestion, and treatment with ethidium monoazide (EMA) [7,10,11], but none of the proposed methods has proved capable of reliably reducing DNA reagent contamination.</p>
        <p>Despite reports and alleged common knowledge, reagent contamination apparently remains underappreciated in the microbiota research community. Most DNA sequence-based publications describing the microbial communities of low-biomass environments do not carry out sequencing of negative controls, or do not describe their contaminant removal or identification procedures [12]. A number of microbiota studies report taxa, often statistically noteworthy, that overlap with those reported for negative control reagents and water [12][13][14].Despite reports and alleged common knowledge, reagent contamination apparently remains underappreciated in the microbiota research community.

        <p>Previous reports dealing with issues of contamination used hypothetical situations and spiked samples to determine the effects of contamination.

        <p>Institutional Review Board approval was obtained at all cooperating Institutions prior to study initiation. Patients with Crohn's disease and non-inflammatory bowel disease (non-IBD) controls scheduled for surgical resections were recruited from the University of Louisville, Kentucky, and Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, El Paso, and affiliated Hospitals. A 1 cm 2 full-thickness section of diseased and/or normal intestinal tissue was obtained under sterile conditions at the time of surgery. Peripheral blood was collected under aseptic conditions in PreAnalytiX PAXgene Blood DNA Tubes (Qiagen, USA) from each patient either at the time of informed consent, during surgical prep, or during surgery.

        <p>Because our laboratory uses many of these kits on a continuous basis, multiple kits are ordered simultaneously (as many as 10 at a time) and often represent several lot numbers. Since each component within each kit lot has an individual lot number and the individual lot numbers often vary within kits of the same lot, and because several entire kits were often used in a single day and henceforth mixed, no efforts were made to keep track of all the various individual lot numbers. DNA was extracted from blood collected in PreAnalytiX PAXgene Blood DNA Tubes with the PreAnalytiX PAXgene ™ Blood DNA Kit (Qiagen, USA). As with the MoBio Kits, the Blood DNA Kits contained kit lot numbers as well as different lot numbers for all the individual kit components.Because our laboratory uses many of these kits on a continuous basis, multiple kits are ordered simultaneously (as many as 10 at a time) and often represent several lot numbers.

        <p>Methods employed for the processing of tissues, separation of mucosal and submucosal tissues, and extraction of DNA have previously been described [8]. Briefly, after intestinal mucosal and submucosal layers were excised and separated, DNA was extracted from mucosal digests and submucosal tissue using the MoBio PowerMax Soil DNA Isolation Kit employing 100 µm molecular biology grade (MBG) Zirconium beads rather than the supplied garnet beads, followed by digestion with proteinase K, and the use of a high-energy cell disrupter as previously described [8].Methods employed for the processing of tissues, separation of mucosal and submucosal tissues, and extraction of DNA have previously been described [8].

        <p>DNA was extracted from blood using the PreAnalytiX PAXgene ™ Blood DNA Kit following the manufacturer's protocol. Indigenous DNA contamination was monitored by replacing tissue with 1 ml of MBG water and 100 µl 1 M DL-dithiothreitol, and blood with 5 ml of MBG water and processed as above for the respective tissue type. All tissue and DNA processing were performed under aseptic conditions.DNA was extracted from blood using the PreAnalytiX PAXgene ™ Blood DNA Kit following the manufacturer's protocol.

        <p>Bacterial species and microbial ecology within tissue samples and reagents were detected and identified using the 16S universal Eubacterial primers 27Fmod and 519Rmod in the Illumina MiSeq platform with methods based upon the bTEFAP ® process [8]. The Q25 sequence data derived from the sequencing were processed using a standardized analysis pipeline [8]. Operational taxonomic units (OTU's) were defined after removal of singleton sequences, clustering at 3 % divergence (97 % similarity). Final OTUs were taxonomically classified using

OTU's that failed to match any bacterial sequence at 77 % or above, were then blasted against non-bacterial databases to produce alignments and identities within the Metazoa, Bacteria, Fungi, and Viridiplantae Kingdoms as well as sequences classified as Unclassified (less than 77 % match with any database sequence).OTU's were assigned taxonomic classification based on standard algorithms using the following taxonomic designation: &gt;97 % identity was classified at the species level; between 97 and 95 % identity was designated as an unclassified species; between 95 and 90 % identity was designated as an unclassified genus; between 90 and 85 % identity was designated as an unclassified family; between 85 and 80 % identity was designated as an unclassified order; between 80 and 77 % identity was designated as an unclassified phylum.

        <p>We attempted to quantify the total bacterial load within samples (both tissue and reagent) using several rRNA gene universal primer sets and probes previously described [7,10,15,16]. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using the Applied BioSystems Taqman Universal Master Mix in an Applied BioSystems Viia-7 Real-Time PCR System using 20 µl total reaction mixture in 384-well plates according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR conditions were 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, and then 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The Qiagen QuantiFast Pathogen PCR + IC Kit was also evaluated according to the manufacturer's instructions. All plates were inoculated with an EpMotions 7075 robotic liquid handling system in 384 well plates. Tissue DNA was normalized to 50 ng/µl, based on optical density in a Nanodrop spectrophotometer, previously determined to be an appropriate concentration in most qPCR applications [17].We attempted to quantify the total bacterial load within samples (both tissue and reagent) using several rRNA gene universal primer sets and probes previously described [7,10,15,16].

A strain of enteroaggregative (EAEC) Escherichia coli (strain 042) was used as a positive control and as a quantitative standard in all assays. No template controls with only MBG water and no template were used to detect bacterial DNA in the qPCR protocol and reagents.

        <p>We first sought to estimate the amount of human and bacterial DNA in each of the samples by comparing the alignment of OTU's to the Bacteria and Metazoan kingdoms. Since it requires 1000 bacterial genomes to equal a single human genome [19], a sample containing an abundance of human DNA would be considered to have a low microbial biomass. Although only semi-quantitative [12], the number of read counts (fasta hits) and the alignment of OTU's can be indicative of the overall relative abundance of bacteria DNA as well as the amount of competing human DNA.We first sought to estimate the amount of human and bacterial DNA in each of the samples by comparing the alignment of OTU's to the Bacteria and Metazoan kingdoms.

        <p>Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA gene sequencing of blood generally produced an average of only ~2000 sequences per sample (as opposed to concurrently processed mucosal tissues which yielded on average ~116,000 sequences). Furthermore, only about 25 % of the generated OTU's in blood aligned to the Kingdom Bacteria, with the remainder 75 % aligning with Metazoa, suggested a low microbial biomass and high metazoan (human) DNA. Similar observations were noted with submucosal tissues. Where mucosal tissues averaged 116,248 sequences per sample, the subjacent submucosal samples (run concurrently) averaged only 15,461 sequences. There was also a significant difference in the number of sequences aligning to the human genome (p ≤ 0.001) between the mucosa and submucosa confirming that submucosal samples, similarly to blood, had a high human DNA relative content and a low microbial biomass.Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA gene sequencing of blood generally produced an average of only ~2000 sequences per sample (as opposed to concurrently processed mucosal tissues which yielded on average ~116,000 sequences).

        <p>In an effort to determine the total bacterial load present within peripheral blood and submucosal tissues of patients with Crohn's disease, we evaluated the use of qPCR using universal rRNA gene primers and Taqman probes. Quantitation, however, generally proved unsuccessful in DNA from blood, submucosal tissues, and other low bacterial biomass samples because C T values were often equal to or greater than those produced in no template controls. No template controls, using irradiated MBG water instead of template, typically produced C T values averaging 29 (range [26][27][28][29][30][31].In an effort to determine the total bacterial load present within peripheral blood and submucosal tissues of patients with Crohn's disease, we evaluated the use of qPCR using universal rRNA gene primers and Taqman probes.

        <p>Samples containing large amounts of human DNA and small amounts of microbial DNA as estimated by fasta counts and OTU alignments, such as submucosal tissues and blood, produced C T values greater than no template controls suggesting that there was less bacteria in the tissue samples than in negative controls (Fig. 1). As such, this background precluded bacterial quantitation with qPCR using universal primers. This inhibition (C T value greater than no template controls) was presumed to be the result of competitive inhibition created by the large amount of human DNA in the sample [20]. Bacterial quantitation could only be achieved in mucosal samples which consistently produced C T values less than negative template controls allowing the amount of bacterial DNA present in the sample to be estimated based on internal bacterial standards.Samples containing large amounts of human DNA and small amounts of microbial DNA as estimated by fasta counts and OTU alignments, such as submucosal tissues and blood, produced C T values greater than no template controls suggesting that there was less bacteria in the tissue samples than in negative controls (Fig. 1).

        <p>Since background contamination precluded bacterial quantitation, we sought to remove the background bacterial DNA in anticipation that such would allow quantitation of submucosal and blood bacterial DNA levels. Pre-treatment of master mixes, primers and probes, and MBG water (for NTC controls) with pre-optimized concentrations of EMA, eliminated or greatly reduced background contaminating microbial DNA but caused a 3-4 cycle downward shift in C T values which adversely affected detection, quantitation, as well as reproducibility and uniformity (standard deviation) of samples. Thus, pre-treatment of reagents with EMA was found to be ineffective in blood and submucosal samples making efforts to eliminate background DNA technically difficult and unproductive.Since background contamination precluded bacterial quantitation, we sought to remove the background bacterial DNA in anticipation that such would allow quantitation of submucosal and blood bacterial DNA levels.

        <p>Spectrophotometric analysis of the PreAnalytiX PAXgene ™ Blood DNA Kit using MBG water instead of blood failed to yield any detectable DNA or the amount of DNA detected was negligible (&lt;1 ng/µl). The processing of MBG water through the MoBio PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit typically yielded an optical density (OD) reading at 260 nm suggesting 19-25 ng DNA per µl. The 260/280 OD ratio was, however, always &gt;2.0 and produced a flattened spectral peak suggesting the presence of contaminants affecting the absorbance at 260 nm. These findings suggest that OD readings obtained following extraction with the MoBio PowerSoil DNA kit may not be accurate and may over estimate the amount of DNA in low biomass samples.Spectrophotometric analysis of the PreAnalytiX PAXgene ™ Blood DNA Kit using MBG water instead of blood failed to yield any detectable DNA or the amount of DNA detected was negligible (&lt;1 ng/µl).

        <p>To more accurately determine the amount of DNA present after processing MBG water through the DNA extraction kits, we performed quantitative qPCR using serial dilutions of pure microbial DNA derived from E. coli. Assuming the complete absence of contamination, the copy number of 16S rRNA genes should correlate with the dilutions of E. coli and reduce or increase in a linear fashion as a standard curve. C T values remained stable and did not reduce further at dilutions below 5 bacterial genomes per µl, indicating the presence of background DNA at approximately 28-35 rRNA copies per µl (4-5 E. coli genomes) in both the Applied Biosystems and the Qiagen Master Mixes (Fig. 2). This contamination estimate was based on the assumption that there was a complete absence of contamination and that the C T values of standards were not influenced or altered by background contaminating DNA levels. Thus, the true level of DNA contamination would be 28-35 rRNA copies per µl + unknown contaminating genomes in the qPCR master mix.To more accurately determine the amount of DNA present after processing MBG water through the DNA extraction kits, we performed quantitative qPCR using serial dilutions of pure microbial DNA derived from E. coli.

        <p>The amount of contaminating DNA calculated above (Fig. 2) was based on the addition of pure E. coli bacterial DNA in MBG-irradiated water and does not consider the effects of human or other DNA as a competitive inhibitor of the PCR reaction, as would be present in most clinical samples [20]. To determine the effect of human DNA on sensitivity (competitive inhibition) and obtain more accurate bacterial quantitation, we added 250 ng of human peripheral blood DNA (50 ng/µl in 5 µl) and increasing amounts of E. coli genomic DNA to ascertain the amount of bacterial DNA required to exceed background in the presence of an excess amount of human DNA. As done previously, assuming a complete absence of contamination, the C T value corresponding to the number of 16S rRNA gene copies present in the sample should correlate with dilutions of E. coli and reduce in a linear manner as a standard curve.The amount of contaminating DNA calculated above (Fig. 2) was based on the addition of pure E. coli bacterial DNA in MBG-irradiated water and does not consider the effects of human or other DNA as a competitive inhibitor of the PCR reaction, as would be present in most clinical samples [20].

        <p>At 125 E. coli genomes, equivalent to 875 rRNA gene copies, the copy number (C T value) remained stable and did not reduce further, indicating that approximately 875 rRNA gene copies (as opposed to 35 rRNA gene copies in water) were required to overcome the inhibitory effects of peripheral blood DNA. These findings support the notion that the true amount of contaminating bacterial DNA is far greater than the 4-5 genomes calculated based on pure bacterial DNA above. Because the peripheral blood DNA did not display any inhibitory effects with primers/probes directed against the human genome, including the human telomerase reverse transcriptase used in DNA quantitation, the inhibition observed is presumed to result from competitive inhibition created by the excess amount of human DNA in the samples.At 125 E. coli genomes, equivalent to 875 rRNA gene copies, the copy number (C T value) remained stable and did not reduce further, indicating that approximately 875 rRNA gene copies (as opposed to 35 rRNA gene copies in water) were required to overcome the inhibitory effects of peripheral blood DNA.

These findings support the notion that DNA extracted from submucosal tissues contains a high human DNA content and a low microbial biomass. The total number of sequences generated, i.e., depth of coverage, was not a reliable indicator of bacterial content.

However, each reagent(s) lot needed to be sequenced in addition to being sequenced concurrently with each sample run to compensate for differences in sequencing depth/ coverage.Identification at the species level based on rRNA gene sequences can only be considered tentative due to overlapping rRNA genes between species and the everchanging bacterial classification at the species level.

        <p>As demonstrated herein, inherent contamination prevented the determination of bacterial load within samples containing low microbial content such as in human intestinal submucosal and peripheral blood samples.

Detection levels were significantly affected by the presence of competing human DNA, increasing to 125 E. coli genomes or 875 rRNA gene copies per µl to overcome background contamination.As demonstrated herein, inherent contamination prevented the determination of bacterial load within samples containing low microbial content such as in human intestinal submucosal and peripheral blood samples.

        <p>The issue of endogenous bacterial DNA contamination is not limited to rRNA microbiota sequencing, but applies equally to PCR and other genetic determinations. We show that a commonly used DNA extraction kit and master mix would contribute 200-275 E. coli equivalent bacterial genomes (2100-2800 rRNA gene copies) in a typical 50 µl qPCR reaction. This level of contamination with endogenous bacterial DNA could greatly influence results, particularly if the target of a PCR reaction was present within the contaminating DNA mixture. As such, it is inappropriate to use MBG water as a negative (NTC) control in PCR reactions as false positive reactions could occur due to microbial contamination from the extraction kit and/or PCR master mixes. DNA extraction blanks using the same extraction kit lots and processing reagents need to be used as NTC controls to monitor for target sequences within DNA contamination. The use of MBG water, the typical control, rather than DNA extraction blanks could account for the irreproducibility of results within and between laboratories [25].The issue of endogenous bacterial DNA contamination is not limited to rRNA microbiota sequencing, but applies equally to PCR and other genetic determinations.

        <p>Although workflow for post-sequencing processing of data has been suggested and is generally the recommended method used to deal with inherent contamination in samples with low bacterial content [26], these methods rely on discounting low prevalence organisms. Discounting low prevalence organisms, however, may be erroneous. Microbial community profiling based on 16S rRNA genes is fraught with bias created by DNA extraction methods, competitive DNA (human or otherwise), primers used during PCR amplification, the sequencing platform used, depth of coverage, and bioinformatics [20,27], to name just a few. Depending on the bias, organisms identified as low prevalence could actually be of high relative frequency or be the most significant microbe in the sample and should not be arbitrarily discarded. It is undisputed that Mycobacterium leprae is the causative agent of human leprosy, but organisms of the genus Mycobacterium appear within the leprous lesion at a relative frequency of 0.0007 % as determined by 16S rRNA microbiota sequencing of leprosy skin lesions [28]. The relative frequency of M. leprae in paucibacillary (tuberculoid) leprosy would be substantially less. Under recommendations to discount low prevalence organisms, mycobacteria in general (including M. leprae) would be erroneously discounted as insignificant. Thus, arbitrarily discarding low prevalence microbes as a means of compensating for contamination issues may be seriously flawed and prevent the detection of pertinent microbes within environmental and tissue samples.Although workflow for post-sequencing processing of data has been suggested and is generally the recommended method used to deal with inherent contamination in samples with low bacterial content [26], these methods rely on discounting low prevalence organisms.

        <p>We routinely perform blank DNA extractions (using irradiated-MBG water rather than tissue) during each tissue extraction to monitor for both endogenous and exogenous contamination. These extraction blanks and water blanks are sequenced side by side with samples so that contamination can be ruled out as the source of unique or unusual findings. However, as noted in Tables 1, 2 and supplemental data, most of the contaminating bacteria are common environmental organisms and/or associated with the gastrointestinal tract or skin. For environmental or tissue samples the problem of identifying contaminants requires special attention as the contaminants may be taxa that are indistinguishable from those genuinely present in the samples.

Absent consideration and descriptions of methods used to monitor and deal with contamination issues, data from tissue and other low microbial biomass studies, such as the tissue microbiota [29,30], must be questioned. As noted herein, DNA extraction kits themselves may generate more than 20,000 sequences on the Illumina MiSeq platform representing more than 81 bacterial genera.Laboratories working on bacterial populations need to define contaminants present in all extraction kits and reagents used in the processing of DNA and make such determinations with each lot and with each processing of samples.

        <p>counts (~1000) and OTU's that corresponded to bacteria were generally equal to or less than blank controls, presumably the result of competitive inhibition by large excesses of human DNA. The OTU's that misaligned with human DNA represented on average 76 % of all generated OTU's. Although 176 discrete bacterial genera were identified within blood samples from patients with Crohn's disease and controls in total, many genera were unique to one or more individuals.counts (~1000) and OTU's that corresponded to bacteria were generally equal to or less than blank controls, presumably the result of competitive inhibition by large excesses of human DNA.
