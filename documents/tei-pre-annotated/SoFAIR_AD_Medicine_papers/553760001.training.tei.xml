        <p>Background: Literature searches underlie the foundations of systematic reviews and related review types. Yet, the literature searching component of systematic reviews and related review types is often poorly reported. Guidance for literature search reporting has been diverse, and, in many cases, does not offer enough detail to authors who need more specific information about reporting search methods and information sources in a clear, reproducible way. This document presents the PRISMA-S (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses literature search extension) checklist, and explanation and elaboration. Methods: The checklist was developed using a 3-stage Delphi survey process, followed by a consensus conference and public review process. Results: The final checklist includes 16 reporting items, each of which is detailed with exemplar reporting and rationale.Background: Literature searches underlie the foundations of systematic reviews and related review types.

        <p>One crucial component of a systematic review is the literature search. The literature search, or information retrieval process, not only informs the results of a systematic review; it is the underlying process that establishes the data available for analysis. Additional components of the systematic review process such as screening, data extraction, and qualitative or quantitative synthesis procedures are dependent on the identification of eligible studies. As such, the literature search must be designed to be both robust and reproducible to ensure the minimization of bias.One crucial component of a systematic review is the literature search.

        <p>Guidelines exist for both the conduct of literature searches (Table 2) for systematic reviews and their reporting [2][3][4][5][6][7]. Problematically, however, the many guidelines for reporting systematic review searches share few common reporting elements. In fact, Sampson et al. discovered that of the eleven instruments designed to help authors report literature searches well, only one item appeared in all eleven instruments [8]. Though Sampson et al.'s study was conducted in 2007, the problem has only been compounded as new checklists and tools have continued to be developed. The most commonly used reporting guidance for systematic reviews, which covers the literature search component, is the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement, or PRISMA Statement [9]. The 2009 PRISMA Statement checklist included three items related to literature search reporting, items 7, 8, and 17:Guidelines exist for both the conduct of literature searches (Table 2) for systematic reviews and their reporting [2][3][4][5][6][7].

        <p>Item 7: Describe all information sources (e.g., databases with dates of coverage, contact with study authors to identify additional studies) in the search and date last searched.

        <p>Despite wide usage of the PRISMA Statement [10], compliance with its items regarding literature search reporting is low [11][12][13][14]. Even for those studies which explicitly reference PRISMA, there is only slight, statistically non-significant evidence of improved reporting, as found by Page et al. [15]. Part of the challenge may be the multifactorial nature of each of the PRISMA items relating to searches; authors may feel if they completed one of the components of the item that they can check off that item altogether. Another part of the challenge may be that many systematic reviews do not include librarians or information specialists as members of the systematic review team or as authors on the final manuscript [11,[16][17][18]. Preliminary research suggests that librarian or information specialist involvement is correlated with reproducibility of searches [16][17][18], likely due to their expertise surrounding search development and documentation. However, reviews where librarians are authors still include reproducible searches only 64% of the time [17].Despite wide usage of the PRISMA Statement [10], compliance with its items regarding literature search reporting is low [11][12][13][14].

        <p>A larger issue may be that, even amongst librarians and information specialists, debate exists as to what constitutes a reproducible search and how best to report the details of the search. Researchers assessing the reproducibility of the search have used varying methods to determine what constitutes a reproducible search [11,17,19,20]. Post-publication peer review of search methods, even amongst Cochrane reviews, which generally have superior reporting compared to non-Cochrane reviews [15], has shown that reporting that appears complete may still pose challenges for those wishing to reproduce searches [20][21][22][23][24]. Furthermore, little guidance on how to report searches using information sources or methods other than literature databases, such as searching web sites or study registries, exists [25,26].A larger issue may be that, even amongst librarians and information specialists, debate exists as to what constitutes a reproducible search and how best to report the details of the search.

        <p>Incomplete reporting of the literature search methods can introduce doubt and diminish trust in the final systematic review conclusions. If researchers are unable to understand or reproduce how information was gathered for a systematic review, they may suspect the authors of having introduced bias into their review by not conducting a thorough or pre-specified literature search. After observing the high number of systematic reviews with poorly reported literature searches, we sought to create an extension to the PRISMA statement.

To create a checklist that could be used by authors, editors, and peer reviewers to verify that each component of a search was completely reported and therefore reproducible. 3.

        <p>Because we intend the checklist to be used in all fields and disciplines, we use "systematic reviews" throughout this document as a representative name for the entire family of evidence syntheses [27]. This includes, but is not limited to, scoping reviews, rapid reviews, realist reviews, metanarrative reviews, mixed methods reviews, umbrella reviews, and evidence maps [28]. We use the term "literature search" or "search" throughout to encompass the full range of possible search methods and information sources.Because we intend the checklist to be used in all fields and disciplines, we use "systematic reviews" throughout this document as a representative name for the entire family of evidence syntheses [27].

        <p>After consultation with members of the PRISMA Statement steering group (D.M. and D.G.A.), we formed an executive committee (M.L.R, J.K., S.K.) and developed a protocol [29] according to the steps outlined in the "Guidance for Developers of Health Research Reporting Guidelines [30]." The protocol was registered on the EQUATOR Network [29]. We identified 405 potential items relevant to reporting searches in systematic reviews from 61 sources (see Additional file 1) located through a search of MEDLINE via Ovid, Embase via Embase.com, and LISTA via EBSCOhost, in addition to reviewing all of the sources identified by the EQUATOR Network relating to systematic reviews. We also searched our personal files and examined references of included documents for additional sources. Details of the search are available in Additional file 1. Sources included both explicit reporting guidelines and studies assessing reproducibility of search strategies. The 405 items were reviewed for overlap and consolidated into 123 remaining items for potential inclusion in a checklist.After consultation with members of the PRISMA Statement steering group (D.M. and D.G.A.), we formed an executive committee (M.L.R, J.K., S.K.) and developed a protocol [29] according to the steps outlined in the "Guidance for Developers of Health Research Reporting Guidelines [30]."

        <p>To narrow the list into a usable checklist, we then used a three-step Delphi survey process [31]. The first survey included the initially identified 123 items and asked respondents to rate each item on a 4-point Likerttype scale. Items that 70% of experts rated as 3 or 4 (4 being "essential" and 1 "not important") and that received a mean score of at least 3.25 were retained for rating in the second round of the Delphi process. Respondents to the first survey were invited to participate in the second and third rounds. The second round asked respondents to pick the 25 most essential items out of the remaining 53 potential items; the third round was identical, except respondents also selected the most appropriate location for reporting their selected items (e.g., in the main text, or a supplementary file). The items were ranked and categorized by general theme for discussion at an in-person consensus conference.To narrow the list into a usable checklist, we then used a three-step Delphi survey process [31].

        <p>We created a list of one hundred and sixty-three international experts, including librarian and information specialists with expertise in systematic reviews, researchers who had written about systematic review reporting, journal editors, and systematic review methodologists, to whom we sent our initial Delphi survey. The list of experts was created using a combination of publications, mailing lists, conference proceedings, and knowledge of the authors to represent research groups and experts in 23 countries. We received 52 responses (32% response rate) to the first survey, and of these, 35 (67% response rate) completed both surveys two and three. This study was declared exempt by the University of Utah Institutional Review Board (IRB_00088425).We created a list of one hundred and sixty-three international experts, including librarian and information specialists with expertise in systematic reviews, researchers who had written about systematic review reporting, journal editors, and systematic review methodologists, to whom we sent our initial Delphi survey.

        <p>The results of the Delphi process were reported at a consensus conference meeting that took place in May 2016 concurrently with Mosaic '16, the joint meeting of the Medical Library Association, Canadian Health Libraries Association/Association des bibliothèques de la santé du Canada, and the International Clinical Librarian Conference (ICLC). 38 individuals attended the consensus conference, 14 (37%) of whom had participated in the Delphi surveys. At the consensus conference, the grouped and ranked remaining items were distributed to small groups who were asked to discuss, consolidate, remove, or add missing critical items under the guidance of a group leader. After two rounds of discussion, the group leaders presented the discussion and proposed list items from their small groups for consideration by the whole group of experts.The results of the Delphi process were reported at a consensus conference meeting that took place in May 2016 concurrently with Mosaic '16, the joint meeting of the Medical Library Association, Canadian Health Libraries Association/Association des bibliothèques de la santé du Canada, and the International Clinical Librarian Conference (ICLC). 38 individuals attended the consensus conference, 14 (37%) of whom had participated in the Delphi surveys.

        <p>Upon completion of the consensus conference, 30 items remained from those identified during the Delphi process, with an additional three items that had been excluded during the Delphi process added back to the draft checklist because meeting attendees considered them critical to the guideline. The list was then consolidated and reviewed by executive committee members, including two new information specialist members (S.W. and A.P.A). The draft checklist and explanation and elaboration document was released to the public on March 20, 2019, along with all data and study materials [32]. All participants in the Delphi process and/or consensus conference were contacted via email with instructions on how to provide feedback on the draft checklist items and/or elaboration and explanation document by commenting directly on the explanation and elaboration draft using a private commenting system, Hypothesis [33], or if preferred, via email. Comments from other interested individuals were solicited via Twitter, conference presentations, and personal contacts. Comments were collected from the private Hypothesis group, the public Hypothesis comments, and via email. All comments were combined into a single document. Executive committee members reviewed each comment in duplicate to indicate what type of feedback was received (i.e., linguistic, major substantive, minor substantive, or unclear) and, for substantive comments, whether change was recommended or required further discussion.Upon completion of the consensus conference, 30 items remained from those identified during the Delphi process, with an additional three items that had been excluded during the Delphi process added back to the draft checklist because meeting attendees considered them critical to the guideline.

Additional feedback from this release was incorporated into the final checklist. Throughout the draft and revision process, several teleconferences were held with the lead of the PRISMA 2020 statement (M.J.P), as an update of the 2009 PRISMA statement was in development, to ensure that the content on search methods was consistent between the PRISMA 2020 and PRISMA-S guidelines [34,35].During the draft and revision process (March 20-June 15, 2019), 358 separate comments were received from 22 individuals and organizations.

        <p>Databases are the most commonly used tool to locate studies to include in systematic reviews and metaanalyses [6,39]. There is no single database that is able to provide a complete and accurate list of all studies that meet systematic review criteria due to the differences in the articles included and the indexing methods used between databases (Table 2). These differences have led to recommendations that systematic review teams search multiple databases to maximize the likelihood of finding relevant studies [6,39,40]. This may include using broad disciplinary databases (e.g., MEDLINE [41], Embase [42], Scopus [43]), specialized databases (e.g., PsycINFO [44] or EconLit [45]), or regional databases (e.g., LILACS [46] or African Index Medicus [47]). Many of these literature databases are available through multiple different search platforms (Table 2). For example, the MEDLINE database is available through at least 10 different platforms, including Ovid, EBSCOhost, Web of Science, and PubMed. Each platform offers different ways of searching the databases, such as platform-specific field codes (Table 2), phrase searching, truncation, or searching full-text versus abstract and keyword only [48]. Different platforms may contain additional data that are not available in the original database, such as times cited, social media impact, or additional keywords. These differences between the platforms can have a meaningful impact on the results provided [48][49][50].Databases are the most commonly used tool to locate studies to include in systematic reviews and metaanalyses [6,39].

        <p>Authors should identify which specific literature databases were searched to locate studies included in the systematic review. It is important that authors indicate not only the database, but the platform through which the database was searched. This helps readers to evaluate the quality and comprehensiveness of the search and supports reproducibility and updating (Table 2) in the future by allowing the strategy to be copied and pasted as recommended in Item 8,below. The distinctions between database and platform may not always be clear to authors, especially when the database is the only one available through a platform (e.g., Scopus [43]). In these cases, authors may choose to include the web address of the database in the text or the bibliography to provide clarity for their readers.Authors should identify which specific literature databases were searched to locate studies included in the systematic review.

Along with the name of the platform, it is necessary to list the names of each of the individual databases included as part of the search. Including information about using this approach in the text of the manuscript helps readers immediately understand how the search was constructed and executed. This helps readers determine how effective the search strategy (Table 2) will be for each database [1].</p>

[62] Explanation Systematic reviews were developed to remove as much bias as possible from the literature review process. One of the most important ways they achieve this reduction in bias is by searching beyond literature databases, which are skewed towards English-language publications with positive results [63,64]. To achieve a fuller picture of what the research on a specific topic looks like, systematic reviewers could seek out research that may be in progress and research that was never published [6]. Using other methods of finding research also helps identify research that may have been indexed in literature databases, but went undiscovered when searching those sources [40]. Seeking out this research often involves a complex strategy, drawing on a wealth of online and print resources as well as personal contacts.Examples "We also searched the grey literature using the search string: "public attitudes" AND "sharing" AND "health data" on Google (in June 2017).

        <p>Studies show that large percentages of research presented as papers and posters at conferences never make their way into the published literature, particularly if the study's results were statistically negative [63,69]. Conference proceedings are often the only way to locate these studies. Including conference proceedings in a systematic review search helps minimize bias [70]. The introduction of online conference proceedings has been a boon to researchers and reduced the need to review printed abstract books. Additionally, some databases either include conference proceedings along with journal articles (i.e., Embase [42]) or contain only conference proceedings (i.e., ProceedingsFirst [71] or Directory of Published Papers [72]). Some conferences have made their abstracts available in a single database (i.e., International AIDS Society's Abstract Archive [73]).

Contacting authors or manufacturers may also be necessary when publications, conference proceedings, or clinical trials registry records do not provide the complete information needed [63,81]. Contacting manufacturers or regulating agencies might be required to acquire complete trial data from the clinical study reports [82,83]. More broad calls for evidence may also be conducted when no specific groups or individuals are targeted."We contacted representatives from the manufacturers of erythropoietin-receptor agonists (Amgen, Ortho-Biotech, Roche), corresponding or first authors of all included trials and subject-area experts for information about ongoing studies." [79] "We also sought data via expert requests. We requested data on the epidemiology of injecting drug use and blood-borne viruses in October, 2016, via an email distribution process and social media. This process consisted of initial emails sent to more than 2000 key experts and organisations, including contacts in the global, regional, and country offices of WHO, UNAIDS, Global Fund, and UNODC (appendix p 61). Staff in those agencies also forwarded the request to their colleagues and other relevant contacts.

        <p>Systematic reviews and related review types rely on thorough and complex search strategies to identify literature on a given topic. The search strategies used to conduct this data gathering are essential to the transparency and reproducibility of any systematic review.

        <p>When space was at a premium in publications, complete reporting of search strategies was a challenge. Because it was necessary to balance the need for transparency with publication restrictions, previous PRISMA guidelines recommended including the complete search strategy from a minimum of one database searched [9]. Many systematic reviews therefore reported only the minimum necessary. However, reporting only selected search strategies can contribute to the observed irreproducibility of many systematic reviews [11,17].When space was at a premium in publications, complete reporting of search strategies was a challenge.

        <p>The prior versions of PRISMA did not elaborate on methods for reporting search strategies outside of literature databases. Subsequent to its publication, many groups have begun identifying the challenges of fully documenting other types of search methods [90,91]. Now recommended is the explicit documentation of all of the details of all search strategies undertaken [91,92]. These should be reported to ensure transparency and maximum reproducibility, including searches and purposeful browsing activities undertaken in web search engines, websites, conference proceeding databases, electronic journals, and study registries.The prior versions of PRISMA did not elaborate on methods for reporting search strategies outside of literature databases.

All languages were included in the search result; non-English results were removed during the review process…. specificity, the updated search was limited to human participants." [99] Explanation Many databases have features that allow searchers to quickly restrict a search using limits. What limits are available in a database are unique to both the database and the platform used to search it. Limits are dependent on the accuracy of the indexer, the timeliness of indexing, and the quality of any publisher-supplied data. For instance, using database limits to restrict searches to randomized controlled trials will only find records identified by the indexer as randomized controlled trials. Since the indexing may take 6 months or more to complete for any given article, searchers risk missing new articles when using database limits.
        </p>
        <p>Using database-provided limit features should not be confused with using filters (see Item 10; Table 2) or inclusion criteria for the systematic review. For example, systematic review teams may choose to only include Englishlanguage randomized controlled trials. This can be done using limits, a combination of a filter (see Item 10) and screening, or screening alone. It should be clear to the reader which approach is used. For instance, in the "Limits described, with one justification" example above, the authors used database limits to restrict their search by publication type, but they did not use database limits to restrict by language, even though that was a component of their eligibility criteria. They also used database limits to restrict to human participants in their search update.Using database-provided limit features should not be confused with using filters (see Item 10; Table 2) or inclusion criteria for the systematic review.

        <p>It is important for transparency and reproducibility that any database limits applied when running the search are reported accurately, as their use has high potential for introducing bias into a search [1,64,100,101]. Database limits are not recommended for use in systematic reviews, due to their fallibility [39,100]. If used, review teams should include a statement of justification for each use of a database limit in the methods section, the limitations section, or both [102,103]. In the examples above, only the last two examples provide some justification in the methods section ("to improve specificity" [99] and "contemporary studies included patient cohorts that are most reflective of current co-morbidities and patient characteristics as a result of the evolving obesity epidemic" [98]).It is important for transparency and reproducibility that any database limits applied when running the search are reported accurately, as their use has high potential for introducing bias into a search [1,64,100,101].

For Embase we used the filter for randomised trials proposed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network [104]." [105] Explanation Filters are a predefined combination of search terms developed to identify references with a specific content, such as a particular type of study design (e.g., randomized controlled trials) [106], populations (e.g., the elderly), or a topic (e.g., heart failure) [107]. They often consist of a combination of subject headings, free-text terms, and publication types [107]. For systematic reviews, filters are generally recommended for use instead of limits built into databases, as discussed in Item 9, because they provide the much higher sensitivity (Table 2) required for a comprehensive search [108].Example "For our MEDLINE search we added a highly sensitive filter for identifying randomised trials developed by the Cochrane Collaboration [38].

Filters, on the other hand, are developed with the express purpose of reuse.

        <p>The literature search is usually conducted at the initial stage of the production of a systematic review. As a consequence, the results of a search may be outdated before the review is published [124][125][126]. The last search in a review should be conducted ideally less than 6 months before publication [90,92,125]. For this reason, authors often update searches by rerunning (Table 2) the same search(es) or otherwise updating searches before the planned publication date.

        <p>When reporting search updates, the extent of reporting depends on methods used and any changes that were made while updating the searches. If there are no changes in information sources and/or search syntax (Table 2), it is sufficient to indicate the date the last search was run in the methods section and in the supplementary materials. If there are any changes in information sources and/or search syntax, the changes should be indicated (e.g., different set of databases, changes in search syntax, date restrictions) in the methods section. Authors should explain why these changes were made. When there were changes in the search strategy syntax, the original and the updated searches should both be reported as described in Item 8.When reporting search updates, the extent of reporting depends on methods used and any changes that were made while updating the searches.

        <p>If authors use email alerts or other methods to update searches, these methods can be briefly described by indicating the method used, the frequency of any updates, the name of the database(s) used, or other relevant information that will help readers understand how the authors conducted search updates.

        <p>Example "A comprehensive literature search was initially on 26 February 2017 and then rerun on 5 February 2018…." [127] Explanation Most literature databases are regularly updated new citations as articles are published. Citations already the database may also be updated once new information (such as indexing terms or citing articles) is available. As an example, MEDLINE added over 900,000 indexed citations (Table 2) in fiscal year 2018 [41]. In addition, the information gathered by databases (such as author affiliations in MEDLINE) can change over time. Because new citations are regularly being added, systematic review guidelines recommend updating searches throughout the writing process to ensure that all relevant articles are retrieved [6,92].Example "A comprehensive literature search was initially on 26 February 2017 and then rerun on 5 February 2018…."

        <p>It is necessary for authors to document the date when searches were executed, either the date the initial search was conducted, if only searched once, or the most recent date the search was rerun. This allows readers to evaluate the currency of each search and understand what literature the search could have potentially identified [125]. In addition, it supports reproducibility and updating by allowing other researchers to use date limits to view the same "slice" of the database that the original authors used or to update a systematic review by searching from the last time point searched.It is necessary for authors to document the date when searches were executed, either the date the initial search was conducted, if only searched once, or the most recent date the search was rerun.

        <p>Example "The strategies were peer reviewed by another senior information specialist prior to execution using the PRESS Checklist [1]." [129] Explanation Peer reviewing search strategies is an increasingly valued component of search strategy development for systematic reviews. Expert guidance recommends taking this step to help increase the robustness of the search strategy [6,74]. Peer reviewing (Table 2) searches is useful to help to guide and improve electronic search strategies. One of peer review's main benefits is the reduction of errors [23,130]. Peer review may also increase the number of relevant records found for inclusion in reviews, thus improving the overall quality of the systematic review [131].Example "The strategies were peer reviewed by another senior information specialist prior to execution using the PRESS Checklist [1]."

        <p>Authors should consider using the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) Guideline statement, a practice guideline for literature search peer review outlining the major components important to review and the benefits of peer reviewing searches [1]. Authors should strongly consider having the search strategy peer reviewed by an experienced searcher, information specialist, or librarian [1,131]. Though peer review may be conducted generally with publication of a protocol, for example, this item is designed to document search-specific peer review.Authors should consider using the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) Guideline statement, a practice guideline for literature search peer review outlining the major components important to review and the benefits of peer reviewing searches [1].

        <p>Recording the flow of citations through the systematic review process is a key component of the PRISMA Statement [9,35]. It is helpful to identify how many records (Table 2) were identified within each database and additional source. Readers can use this information to see whether databases or expert contacts constituted the majority of the records reviewed, for example. Knowing the number of records from each source also helps with reproducibility. If a reader tries to duplicate a search from a systematic review, one would expect to retrieve nearly the same results when limiting to the timeframe in the original review. If instead, the searcher locates a drastically different number of results than reported in the original review, this can be indicative of errors in the published search [23] or major changes to a database, both of which might be reasons to update a systematic review or view the systematic review's results with skepticism.Recording the flow of citations through the systematic review process is a key component of the PRISMA Statement [9,35].

        <p>Example "Duplicates were removed by the librarians (LP, PJE), using 
            <rs type="software">EndNote</rs>'s duplicate identification strategy and then manually." [134] Explanation Databases contain significant overlap in content. When searching in multiple databases and additional information sources, as is necessary for a systematic review, authors often employ a variety of techniques to reduce the number of duplicates within their results prior to screening [135][136][137][138]. Techniques vary in their efficacy, sensitivity, and specificity (Table 2) [136,138]. Knowing which method is used enables readers to evaluate the process and understand to what extent these techniques may have removed false positive duplicates [138]. Authors should describe and cite any software or technique used, when applicable. If duplicates were removed manually, authors should include a description.

        <p>The PRISMA-S extension is designed to be used in conjunction with PRISMA 2020 [35] and PRISMA extensions including PRISMA-P for protocols [36], PRISMA-ScR for scoping reviews [139], the PRISMA Network Meta-analyses statement [140], and PRISMA-IPD for systematic reviews using individual patient data [141]. It may also be used with other reporting guidelines that relate to systematic reviews and related review types, such as RepOrting standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses (ROSES) [142]. It provides additional guidance for systematic review teams, information specialists, librarians, and other researchers whose work contains a literature search as a component of the research methods. Though its origins are in the biomedical fields, PRIS MA-S is flexible enough to be applied in all disciplines that use method-driven literature searching. Ultimately, PRISMA-S attempts to give systematic review teams a framework that helps ensure transparency and maximum reproducibility of the search component of their review.The PRISMA-S extension is designed to be used in conjunction with PRISMA 2020 [35] and PRISMA extensions including PRISMA-P for protocols [36], PRISMA-ScR for scoping reviews [139], the PRISMA Network Meta-analyses statement [140], and PRISMA-IPD for systematic reviews using individual patient data [141].

        <p>PRISMA-S is intended to capture and provide specific guidance for reporting the most common methods used in systematic reviews today. As new methods and information sources are adopted, authors may need to adjust their reporting methods to accommodate new processes. Currently, PRISMA-S does not address using text mining or text analysis methods to create the search, for example, though this is an increasingly common way for information specialists to develop robust and objective search strategies [143][144][145]. Likewise, PRISMA-S does not require that decisions about the rationale behind choices in search terms and search construction be recorded, though this provides readers a great deal of insight. In the future, methods and rationales used to create search strategies may become more important for reproducibility.PRISMA-S is intended to capture and provide specific guidance for reporting the most common methods used in systematic reviews today.

        <p>PRISMA-S offers extensive guidance for many different types of information source and methods, many of them not described in detail in other reporting guidelines relating to literature searching. This cludes detailed information on reporting study registry web searches, multi-database searches, and updates. PRISMA-S can help authors report all components of their search, hopefully reporting process easier. As a note, PRISMA-S provides guidance on transparent reporting to authors and is not intended as a tool to either guide conduct of a systematic review or to evaluate the quality of a search or a systematic review.PRISMA-S offers extensive guidance for many different types of information source and methods, many of them not described in detail in other reporting guidelines relating to literature searching.
