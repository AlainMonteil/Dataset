        <p>Background: This position statement provides clinical recommendations for the assessment of pain, level of sedation, iatrogenic withdrawal syndrome and delirium in critically ill infants and children. Admission to a neonatal or paediatric intensive care unit (NICU, PICU) exposes a child to a series of painful and stressful events. Accurate assessment of the presence of pain and non-pain-related distress (adequacy of sedation, iatrogenic withdrawal syndrome and delirium) is essential to good clinical management and to monitoring the effectiveness of interventions to relieve or prevent pain and distress in the individual patient.Background: This position statement provides clinical recommendations for the assessment of pain, level of sedation, iatrogenic withdrawal syndrome and delirium in critically ill infants and children.

        <p>This position statement provides clinical recommendations for the assessment of pain, level of sedation, iatrogenic withdrawal syndrome (IWS) and delirium in critically ill infants and children. Admission to a neonatal or paediatric intensive care unit (NICU, PICU) exposes a child to a series of painful and stressful events. The effects of these events are commonly resolved by the administration of analgesics (e.g. morphine, fentanyl) and/or sedatives (e.g. benzodiazepines, α2-selective adrenergic agonists) [1]. However, sedation with benzodiazepines in neonates is advised against in view of the unfavourable patient outcomes [2]. A recent survey showed wide variety in both the dosages and choices of drugs administered to neonates [3]. While adequate analgesia and sedation help reduce the stress response and improve the clinical and psychological outcomes [4], inadequate analgesia and sedation will lead to pain, pain-induced agitation or undersedation and possibly to accidental extubation or removal of vascular access devices. Overuse of analgesic and sedative agents, on the other hand, can lead to oversedation, prolonged ICU stay, longer ventilation times, drug tolerance and dependence. Furthermore, IWS and delirium could be identified as side effects of prolonged analgesia and sedation [5,6]. Both are considered as concepts of non-pain-related distress in critically ill children. The current clinical guidelines on analgesic and sedative drugs use in adult and paediatric ICU populations [7,8] are based on evidence of highly variable level.This position statement provides clinical recommendations for the assessment of pain, level of sedation, iatrogenic withdrawal syndrome (IWS) and delirium in critically ill infants and children.

        <p>Accurate and regular measurement of pain and nonpain-related distress is essential, not only to establish their presence [9] but also to monitor the effectiveness of interventions. The effectiveness of pharmacological interventions should be monitored because this may be affected by the specific pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in the individual critically ill child [10]. The gold standard of assessing patient comfort is self-reporting. Self-report is impossible, however, in preverbal and nonverbal children who are often sedated or when a tracheal tube is in place. In these cases, healthcare professionals must resort to observing the child's physiological and behavioural responses. Still, healthcare professionals' observations and assessments of pain and non-painrelated distress will depend on their ideas and beliefs on discomfort, pain, best drugs and treatment, and on their knowledge. On the other hand, as we know from adults [11], it may be difficult to discriminate between pain, distress, IWS and delirium in critically ill children, because the behavioural cues will overlap in part (Fig. 1). Therefore, standardized assessment tools have been proposed and validated so as to limit avoidable variability in assessment [12]. In practice, a patient's individual analgesia and sedation requirements will be assessed by different nurses, with varying degrees of expertise, which may lead to inconsistent dosing of sedatives and analgesics [13]. Use of a standard tool may counteract this effect and promote continuity of care [14].Accurate and regular measurement of pain and nonpain-related distress is essential, not only to establish their presence [9] but also to monitor the effectiveness of interventions.

        <p>A multidisciplinary group of expert clinicians and researchers in the fields of pain, sedation, withdrawal syndrome and delirium were recruited from the membership of the European Society of Paediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care (ESPNIC) to develop the position statement. The process of formulating the clinical recommendation comprised the following steps. First, questions were formulated regarding the clinical practice of assessment of pain-related and non-pain-related distress (e.g. adequacy of sedation, IWS and delirium) in critically ill and nonverbal children. Second, an extensive search of the literature on assessment tools was performed to find evidence for recommendations. For this reason, the PubMed/Medline, CINAHL and Embase databases were searched using the following MeSH and all fields search terms: (pain measurement, distress, sedation, iatrogenic withdrawal syndrome, delirium) AND (paediatric critical care OR neonatal intensive care) (see supplementary material for search strategy). The search scope was limited to studies in the English or French language published between August 2005 and August 2015, so as to provided the most up to date relevant research, which included paediatric or neonatal critical care nonverbal inpatients, with the age limits set from birth to 18 years. Neonates were included, as they can be admitted to PICUs in some European settings. In the past few decades more than 40 neonatal pain assessment tools have been developed and validated. From two recent systematic reviews we derived the most recent evidence of the psychometric properties of neonatal pain (e.g. acute, prolonged pain) assessment instruments [15,16]. On the basis on this, we described the psychometric properties of the most commonly used neonatal instruments. Additional search terms, such as pain questionnaires, pain scales, pain tools, pain instruments and search of authors known in the field served to verify completeness of the search results. Cross-referencing of key articles and recently published systematic reviews describing psychometric properties of assessment instruments [17,18] served as a final check. Prior to full-text retrieval, studies describing the psychometric properties of instruments to assess physiological and behavioural cues of pain-related and/ or non-pain-related distress were selected on the basis of the title and abstract. Studies that did not report on psychometric properties of the tools and those that only reported on neonatal abstinence syndrome were excluded.A multidisciplinary group of expert clinicians and researchers in the fields of pain, sedation, withdrawal syndrome and delirium were recruited from the membership of the European Society of Paediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care (ESPNIC) to develop the position statement.

        <p>In the third phase, each of the articles selected was subjected to an independent grade of evidence review by at least two of the authors and differences in grading were resolved through discussion. The level of the evidence was assigned a grade using the definitions provided in a supplementary table and based on reference test, specific research design and methodology [19]. Subsequently, recommendations for assessment of pain-related and non-pain-related distress in children were formulated and discussed by the group during a meeting. The recommendations were assigned according to the level of evidence. Lastly, to achieve consensus the draft position statement was reviewed by independent members of the ESPNIC Nursing Science section (Pain &amp; Sedation study group) and the Pharmacology section; they graded the importance of the statements related to the topic area. This process did not lead to any fundamental changes. The final version was endorsed by the Executive Board of ESPNIC.In the third phase, each of the articles selected was subjected to an independent grade of evidence review by at least two of the authors and differences in grading were resolved through discussion.

        <p>Pain assessment in hospitalised infants and children is notoriously difficult because of the different emotional and cognitive development stages of this patient group. Moreover, they are often ventilated and sedated, which complicates assessment of behaviours, and interpreting pain-related behaviours is often subjective, relying on the clinicians' interpretation.Pain assessment in hospitalised infants and children is notoriously difficult because of the different emotional and cognitive development stages of this patient group.

        <p>For intensive care settings, we can distinguish two relevant types of pain: (1) acute pain, including procedural and postoperative pain (e.g. pain caused by heelstick, suctioning, venepuncture, thoracic drainage) and postoperative pain; and (2) prolonged pain (see Table 1 for definitions). For clinical reasons it is important to explore the underlying pathogenesis and the context of pain (Fig. 2).

        <p>Children and neonates in the intensive care setting undergo numerous procedures which potentially cause pain, e.g. intravenous cannulation, chest drain insertion, intubation or discomfort, e.g. from invasive monitoring lines. Nurses and physicians should be aware, however, that daily care (e.g. turning) can be painful as well, and that what is considered painful in older children and adults [20] should also be considered painful for children and neonates. Neonates are particularly at risk of pain exposure with a reported mean of 10.0-22.9 procedures per day [21,22]. Prolonged pain is poorly understood, but is characterised by a lack of clear stimulus, a variable duration and slow recovery [23]. Furthermore it is present after several days of hospitalisation and when no obvious cause for pain is present [24].Children and neonates in the intensive care setting undergo numerous procedures which potentially cause pain, e.g. intravenous cannulation, chest drain insertion, intubation or discomfort, e.g. from invasive monitoring lines.

        <p>There is limited literature on pain assessment in the PICU; the available studies concern the validation of instruments such as the COMFORT scale [25,26], the COMFORT-B scale1 [27][28][29][30][31][32][33], the FLACC scale [32,34,35] and the Multidimensional Assessment Pain Scale (MAPS) [36,37]. The COMFORT-B scale has also been validated for patients with burns [38]. In contrast, more than 40 pain assessment instruments for neonates have been developed in the last few decades, but not all meet the minimum psychometric requirements for application in clinical practice [16]. The well-established, validated COMFORT-B scale and the FLACC scale (for infants and children) [39] and the promising PIPP-R (for neonates) [40,41] are recommended (see Tables 2, 3 and supplementary material for their psychometric properties).There is limited literature on pain assessment in the PICU; the available studies concern the validation of instruments such as the COMFORT scale [25,26], the COMFORT-B scale1 [27][28][29][30][31][32][33], the FLACC scale [32,34,35] and the Multidimensional Assessment Pain Scale (MAPS) [36,37].

        <p>Although clinical judgement of trained ICU professionals is important, the use of a sedation assessment tool is needed to determine the efficacy of sedatives and related interventions, to facilitate inter-institutional comparisons and to facilitate targeted sedation. Several behavioural sedation scoring scales (e.g. COMFORT scale [25,45], COMFORT behaviour scale [14,42], State Behaviour Scale [46]) have been described and validated for children (Tables 2,4, supplementary material). Also, these tools are the most commonly used instruments in daily practice [47].

Although the frequency of assessment will depend on whether symptoms have been controlled or not and on the goal of therapeutic treatment (e.g. weaning of ventilation), we recommend regular assessment at least once per shift and accurate documentation of the sedation score.Although clinical judgement of trained ICU professionals is important, the use of a sedation assessment tool is needed to determine the efficacy of sedatives and related interventions, to facilitate inter-institutional comparisons and to facilitate targeted sedation.

        <p>Delirium is a neurocognitive disorder due to a somatic illness or its treatment. According to DSM-5 the core diagnostic criteria for delirium are (Table 1) (a) a disturbance of attention or awareness; (b) this disturbance is accompanied by changes in cognition that cannot be better accounted for by another pre-existing neurocognitive disorder (e.g. mental retardation, dementia); (c) the condition develops within hours or days, and often fluctuates during the day, typically worsening in the evening ('sundowning') and (d) there are indications from the patient's history, examination or laboratory results that the disturbance is probably the result of a medical condition or its treatment [61]. The pathogenesis of delirium is largely unknown. The sufferers may be hyperactive, hypoactive or show signs of both states. Typical for the hypoactive delirium are slowed or sparse speech, hypoactive or slowed motor activity as well as lethargy, also described as reduced awareness or apathy. Adults and children largely show the same symptoms although hallucinations and hypoactive delirium are hard to observe in the very young children [62]. However, delirium has been described in infants below 1 year of age [63]. Delirium has not been described in neonates to date. Increasing evidence suggests there is a positive association between illness severity and paediatric delirium [64]. Many risk factors for delirium have been identified. These can be classified as patient-related, iatrogenic and environmental. Patient factors (e.g. infections, metabolic disorders, withdrawal from medications, restraints and sleep disturbance) and environmental factors may contribute to developing delirium [56].Delirium is a neurocognitive disorder due to a somatic illness or its treatment.

        <p>The reported prevalence of paediatric delirium (PD) in PICU patients is 4-29 % [56,65,66]. Colville et al. found that 3 months after discharge one-third of PICU patients reported memories of psychotic features, including delusions and disturbing hallucinations, suggestive of delirium during PICU admission [67]. Adult delirium has been associated with higher mortality and morbidity and longer length of hospital stay [68]. PD, too, is associated with longer length of stay [69] and-as we suspect-increased morbidity. Thus, early recognition of this serious neuropsychiatric disorder is essential, and PICU nurses could facilitate this task.The reported prevalence of paediatric delirium (PD) in PICU patients is 4-29 % [56,65,66].

        <p>According to the literature, PD is underdiagnosed especially in young critically ill children [56]. A likely reason is that nurses and ICU physicians do not specifically focus on the symptoms of PD; and moreover, it is difficult to assess the symptoms in preverbal patients. Looking at behaviours has been suggested as an alternative [56,63]. Taking into account the child's developmental stages makes it possible to reliably and accurately interpret alterations in behaviour, communication and emotion in the critically ill child of any age [70]. A number of delirium symptoms overlap with those observed in other conditions, such as pain, distress and withdrawal syndrome [6]. Thus it would seem essential to use a reliable, validated and clinically useful bedside tool to screen delirium and guide treatment. This is an area of development but assessment instruments are already available. These are (1) the paediatric Confusion Assessment Method for ICU (pCAM-ICU) for children of 5 years or older [66]; (2) the Cornell Assessment Paediatric Delirium tool (CAP-D) for children of 0 up to 18 years of age [65,71] and (3) the Sophia Observation withdrawal Symptoms-Paediatric Delirium scale [72,73] (Table 5; supplementary material).

        <p>Effective pain and sedation management depends on the effectiveness of analgesics and sedatives as well as the use of assessment instruments to measure the effects and target of the administered drugs. A number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have provided evidence for the use of individual drugs such as morphine, midazolam, paracetamol, clonidine and dexmedetomidine [74][75][76][77]. The combined use of drugs in infants has also been evaluated, like fentanyl versus remifentanil combined with midazolam [78] or remifentanil versus midazolam [79]. The use of fentanyl or morphine is common practice around the world for postoperative analgesia in term newborns, infants and children, with recommended continuous infusions and dosages of 1-5 mcg/kg/h (fentanyl) and 10-40 mcg/kg/h (morphine), respectively [8].Effective pain and sedation management depends on the effectiveness of analgesics and sedatives as well as the use of assessment instruments to measure the effects and target of the administered drugs.

Still, daily interruption of sedatives significantly improved short-and long-term outcomes in adults. All evidence indicates that the use of sedatives should be reduced. In children, daily interruption of sedation seems feasible and safe [81,82].

        <p>Following the evaluation of the level of evidence of analgesic and sedative drugs by Playfor [8], increased attention is being paid to optimal dosing of many of the drugs used routinely in the PICUs around the world. Studies have demonstrated that reassessment after an intervention is often neglected, although it is crucial in evaluating whether an intervention is effective or not [84,85]. In summary, the overall aim of assessment of pain and nonpain-related distress in relation to treatment is to find the most appropriate dose for the individual patient to eliminate or reduce pain and discomfort to an acceptable level without side effects of therapy. Therefore, we recommend that the effect of a drug (e.g. increasing or decreasing of a pump, bolus) is re-evaluated depending on the drug's half-life. One value outside the normal range of the score should not immediately result into a change in drug dosages. Strategies to reduce the incidence of IWS should begin by making efforts to reduce doses of benzodiazepines and/or opioids, and thereby preventing oversedation [44,86].Following the evaluation of the level of evidence of analgesic and sedative drugs by Playfor [8], increased attention is being paid to optimal dosing of many of the drugs used routinely in the PICUs around the world.

        <p>Providing comfort and minimizing anxiety, fear and distress in critically ill infants and children are an important part of the daily activities of intensive care nurses. These patients, who are unable to communicate their pain, discomfort, anxiety and fear, are at great risk of inadequate analgesia, sedation or delayed recognition of withdrawal syndrome and/or delirium. Just like all infants and children, this special population deserves consistent, on-going assessment and reassessment of interventions to confirm the best possible treatment for pain, distress, inadequate sedation, withdrawal syndrome and delirium. This position paper offers recommendations to this aim. To achieve the best possible outcome, interdisciplinary collaboration of nurses, physicians and hospital pharmacists/clinical pharmacologists is therefore warranted. Distress can be reduced by creating an optimal environment with little noise (&lt;45 dB), favourable conditions for day-night (sleep) rhythm in combination with daylight, and family presence [87]. However, more research is needed to establish the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions in critically ill children. Furthermore, the nursing role includes providing information to parents, asking them about the nature and intensity of pain and distress of their infant or child and consequently listening to parents. This requires a particular awareness, knowledge of and insight into these phenomena. It may be difficult to discriminate between pain, distress, IWS and delirium in critically ill children, because the behavioural cues will overlap in part (Fig. 1). Pain frequently results in distress, but distress may have other causes than pain. Despite their close association, distinguishing between these concepts is clinically important as they are treated differently. A behavioural tool that is able to discriminate pain, sedation, IWS and delirium in all circumstances is not available. It could be challenging for clinicians to deal with all these different instruments.Providing comfort and minimizing anxiety, fear and distress in critically ill infants and children are an important part of the daily activities of intensive care nurses.
