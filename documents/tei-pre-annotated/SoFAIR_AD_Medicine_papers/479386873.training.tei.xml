        <p>SARS-CoV, including SARS-CoV-2, are known to enter human host cells primarily by binding to the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and by the action of the serine protease TMPRSS2 for spike (S) protein priming 13 . Supporting evidence comes from animal studies demonstrating that SARS-CoV is capable of entering the brain upon intranasal infection of mice expressing human ACE2 (refs. 12,14 ). In the lung, bronchial transient secretory cells express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (ref. 15 ). Similarly, there is evidence for ACE2 expression in neuronal and glial cells in the human CNS 16 .

        <p>We analyzed the cellular mucosal-nervous micromilieu as a first site of viral infection and replication, followed by thorough regional mapping of the consecutive olfactory nervous tracts and defined CNS regions, in autopsy material from 33 individuals with COVID-19 (n = 22 male and n = 11 female) examined between March and August of 2020 (Supplementary Tables 1 and2). The median age at death was 71.6 years (interquartile range, 67-79 years; range, 30 to 98 years), and the time from onset of COVID-19 symptoms to death ranged from 4 to 79 days, with a median of 31 days. Cases were not preselected with regard to clinical and/or neurological symptoms, which, owing to the pandemic situation, in some instances were not fully documented or not possible to retrieve. Clinically documented COVID-19-associated neurological alterations included impaired consciousness (n = 5), intraventricular hemorrhage (n = 2), headache (n = 2) and behavioral changes (n = 2); acute cerebral ischemia was reported for 2 individuals, while neuropathological postmortem workup revealed acute infarcts in 6 individuals (Supplementary Table 2). Coexisting conditions included diabetes mellitus (n = 4), hypertension (n = 21), cardiovascular disease (n = 9), hyperlipidemia (n = 2), chronic kidney disease (n = 2), prior stroke (n = 6) and dementia (n = 5) (Supplementary Table 1). Although all 33 individuals required mechanical ventilation and at the time of autopsy were found to have suffered from COVID-19-associated lung disease, 9 did not receive mechanical ventilation according to the will of the respective individual. Additional clinical information on comorbidities is provided in Supplementary Table 1. Thirty-one individuals were proven to be positive by quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT-qPCR) for SARS-CoV-2 before death (n = 31 of 33), while 2 individuals showed a clinical presentation highly suggestive of COVID-19 (n = 2 of 33). Correspondingly, ACE2 was detectable in olfactory mucosa by means of immunohistochemistry, while we found no reliable ACE2 immunoreactivity in the parenchyma of the CNS, namely, in the olfactory bulb and medulla oblongata (Supplementary Fig. 1).We analyzed the cellular mucosal-nervous micromilieu as a first site of viral infection and replication, followed by thorough regional mapping of the consecutive olfactory nervous tracts and defined CNS regions, in autopsy material from 33 individuals with COVID-19 (n = 22 male and n = 11 female) examined between March and August of 2020 (Supplementary Tables 1 and2).

        <p>Regional mapping of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in olfactory mucosa, its nervous projections and distinct CNS regions. Assessment of viral load by means of RT-qPCR in regionally defined tissue samples including the olfactory mucosa (R1), olfactory bulb (R2), olfactory tubercle (R3), oral mucosa (uvula; R4), trigeminal ganglion (R5), medulla oblongata (R6) and cerebellum (R7) demonstrated the highest levels of viral RNA for SARS-CoV-2 within the olfactory mucosa sampled directly beneath the cribriform plate (n = 20 of 30; Fig. 1a). Lower levels of viral RNA were found in the cornea, conjunctiva and oral mucosa, highlighting the oral and ophthalmic routes as additional potential sites of SARS-CoV-2 CNS entry (Fig. 1b-d). In only a few COVID-19 autopsy cases, the cerebellum (n = 3 of 24) was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by means of RT-qPCR. The carotid artery wall served as a control tissue for excluding or proving systemic (vascular) entry routes to the CNS and was found to be negative in 12 of the 13 samples analyzed; the one positive result was derived from the carotid artery of an individual with acute COVID-19 disease. Subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) is used as a surrogate for active viral replication. We obtained a positive result in 4 of 20 olfactory mucosa samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and 1 of 6 uvula samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but in none of the other tissues analyzed in this study (Fig. 1b-d and Supplementary Table 2). Disease duration inversely correlated with the amount of detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the CNS, with high SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels found in individuals with COVID-19 who had relatively short disease duration, whereas individuals with prolonged COVID-19 disease typically had low RNA load (correlation coefficient r = -0.5, **P = 0.006 from n = 29 individuals; Fig. 1e).Regional mapping of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in olfactory mucosa, its nervous projections and distinct CNS regions.

        <p>The olfactory mucosal-nervous milieu as a SARS-CoV-2 CNS entry-prone interface. Anatomical proximity of neurons, nerve fibers and mucosa within the oro-and nasopharynx (Fig. 2a-f) and the reported clinical-neurological signs related to alterations in smell and taste perception suggest that SARS-CoV-2 exploits this neural-mucosal interface as a port of entry into the CNS. The olfactory epithelium is organized as a pseudostratified epithelial structure mainly composed of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), apical sustentacular cells, Bowman's gland (BG), microvillous cells and neural stem cells 19 . Horizontal basal cells (HBCs) and globose basal cells (GBCs) complete the spectrum of immature and mature neural/neuronal cells 20,21 . On the apical side of the olfactory mucosa, the dendrites of OSNs project into the nasal cavity, while on the basal side the axons of OSNs merge into fila, which protrude through the cribriform plate directly into the olfactory bulb (Fig. 2), thereby also having contact with CSF 22 . OSNs are bipolar cells, and somatic (including dendritic and axonal) expression of olfactory membrane protein (OMP) indicates their mature state (Fig. 2g), while expression of class III β-tubulin (TuJ1) corresponds to both immature and mature neuronal cells within the olfactory mucosa 20 (Fig. 2h). The neuronal cells coalesce with the other cells to the epithelial layer. SARS-CoV-2 tropism within the olfactory mucosa. When assessing the local distribution of SARS-CoV-2 within SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive tissue at the cellular level, we found that SARS-CoV S protein was most prevalent in the olfactory mucosa. Using immunohistochemistry, distinct immunoreactivity for SARS-CoV S protein, including a characteristic granular, partly perinuclear pattern, was found in morphologically distinct cell types indicative of neuronal/ neural origin (Fig. 3a).

On the ultrastructural level, we were able to detect intact CoV particles in an individual with high viral RNA load and presence of sgRNA (Fig. 3c-f). Re-embedding of FFPE olfactory mucosa for electron microscopy (EM) allowed selective assessment of a tissue region with a strong SARS-CoV-2 RNA ISH signal (Fig. 3b). Characteristic CoV substructures within the respective cellular compartments were found as expected, including surface projections (spikes) and partially visible membrane envelope as well as a heterogeneous and partly granular electron-dense interior due to the presence of ribonucleoprotein (RNP). Only subtle ultrastructural differences as compared to CoV-infected cell cultures were noted. These were clearly discernible from intrinsic cellular structures or artifacts and can be entirely explained by the FFPE re-embedding procedure [23][24][25][26][27][28] (Supplementary Fig. 2).NATuRe NeuROSCIeNCe (FFPE) samples (Fig. 3b).

        <p>The SARS-CoV-2-mediated neuroinflammatory response. As an indirect sign of local infection and ongoing inflammation, we looked for small cell clusters of early activated macrophages expressing myeloid-related protein 14 (MRP14), which were detected in the olfactory epithelium (Supplementary Fig. 1). These cells can initiate and regulate an immune cascade that, upon influenza virus infection, has been shown to act as an endogenous damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), ultimately initiating a virus-associated inflammatory response via TLR4-MyD88 signaling 29 . In the CNS, we found strong upregulation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR on microglia/macrophages, which were often arranged in so-called microglial nodules, in 13 of 25 individuals analyzed (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 4b-f). There was no evidence of MRP14 + cells nor of infiltrating lymphomonocytic cells within the CNS.

        <p>Presence of intact CoV particles together with SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the olfactory mucosa, as well as in neuroanatomical areas receiving olfactory tract projections (Fig. 1b), may suggest SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion occurring via axonal transport. However, morphological detection of single viral particles in axons is (if possible at all) very difficult owing to the very low number of viral particles that are expected, given that the viral reproduction apparatus is thought to be located in the neuronal somata. This difficulty in visualizing SARS-CoV-2 within the CNS on a cellular level is further aggravated by the fact that the olfactory bulb is a relatively small CNS region with a limited number of neurons, which is evidenced by the small amount of viral RNA that was obtained in COVID-19 cases harboring SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive olfactory bulbs. In addition, the ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 may also be affected by the duration of COVID-19 infection, as the duration determines the viral load at a given time point and location, and we cannot exclude the possibility that virus-infected (neuronal) cells might die and thus evade detection.Presence of intact CoV particles together with SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the olfactory mucosa, as well as in neuroanatomical areas receiving olfactory tract projections (Fig. 1b), may suggest SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion occurring via axonal transport.

        <p>As we were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in some individuals in CNS regions that have no direct connection to the olfactory mucosa, such as the cerebellum, there may be other mechanisms or routes of viral entry into the CNS, possibly in addition to or in combination with axonal transport. For instance, migration of SARS-CoV-2-carrying leukocytes across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) or viral entry along CNS endothelia cannot be excluded. The latter is a valid possibility, at least in addition to a presumably axonal route, as we found immunoreactivity to SARS-CoV S protein in cerebral and leptomeningeal endothelial cells (Fig. 6b,c and Supplementary Fig. 5).As we were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in some individuals in CNS regions that have no direct connection to the olfactory mucosa, such as the cerebellum, there may be other mechanisms or routes of viral entry into the CNS, possibly in addition to or in combination with axonal transport.

Taking our findings together, we provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion can occur at the neural-mucosal interface by transmucosal entry via regional nervous structures. This may be followed by transport along the olfactory tract of the CNS, thus explaining some of the well-documented neurological symptoms in COVID-19, including alterations of smell and taste perception. One caveat to note with the COVID-19 cases reported here is the relatively long postmortem interval, an almost insurmountable obstacle in autopsy studies, especially when performed under the emergency-like conditions encountered during a pandemic situation. Analysis of these samples is limited by well-known restrictions resulting from autolysis of cells and tissues, ultimately complicating the interpretation of morphological and molecular analyses. In spite of these limitations, we were able to retrieve numerous valuable insights. These included the detection of well-preserved CoV particles at the ultrastructural level in an individual with an 82-hour postmortem interval (P15) and important pathogenetic insights, thus enabling further, more detailed and mechanistic investigations while encouraging further autopsy studies including broad sampling to allow multiple complementary analyses and the application of state-of-the-art methodologies. Such studies will allow identification of the precise cellular and molecular SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanism as well as receptors on OSNs, where non-neuronal pathways may also have a role 17 .NATuRe NeuROSCIeNCe vascular damage and allow the virus to spread more widely to other brain regions over time, thus eventually contributing to a more severe or even chronic disease course, depending on various factors such as the duration of viral persistence, viral load and immune status, among others.

        <p>Histological and immunohistochemical techniques. FFPE tissue blocks were taken at the day of autopsy when the postmortem interval was shorter than 24 h and fixed for 24 h in 4% paraformaldehyde. Otherwise, brain tissue was fixed for 14 d in 4% paraformaldehyde before cutting. Routine histological staining (H&amp;E, Masson-Goldner, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reaction and toluidine blue) was performed according to standard procedures. Immunohistochemical staining was performed either on a Benchmark XT autostainer (Ventana Medical Systems) with standard antigen retrieval methods (CC1 buffer, pH 8.0, Ventana Medical Systems) or manually using 1-μm-or 4-μm-thick FFPE tissue sections. The following primary antibodies were used: polyclonal rabbit anti-S100 (Dako, Z0311; 1:3,000), monoclonal mouse anti-AE1/AE3 (Dako, M3515; 1:200), monoclonal mouse anti-MRP14 (Acris, BM4026B; 1:500, pretreatment protease), monoclonal mouse anti-CD56 (Serotec, ERIC-1; 1:200), mouse monoclonal anti-SARS spike glycoprotein (Abcam, ab272420; 1:100), goat anti-OMP (Wako, 019-22291; 1:1,000), rabbit monoclonal anti-βIII tubulin (Abcam, ab215037; 1:2,000), rabbit polyclonal anti-NF200 (Sigma, N4142; 1:100), rabbit polyclonal anti-ACE2 (Proteintech, 21115-1-AP; 1:3,000) and rabbit polyclonal anti-OLIG2 (IBL, 18953; 1:150, pretreatment Tris-EDTA + microwave). Briefly, primary antibodies were applied and developed by using either the iVIEW DAB Detection kit (Ventana Medical Systems) and the ultraView Universal Alkaline Phosphatase Red Detection kit (Ventana Medical Systems) or manual application of biotinylated secondary antibodies (biotinylated donkey anti-sheep-goat (1:200; Amersham, RPN 1025), biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit (1:200), biotinylated sheep anti-mouse (1:200; Amersham, RPN 1001), rabbit immunoglobulin (RPN1004), peroxidase-conjugated avidin and diaminobenzidine (DAB; Sigma, D5637) or 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazol (AEC). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated in a graded alcohol and xylene series, mounted and coverslipped. Immunohistochemistry sections were evaluated by at least two board-certified neuropathologists with concurrence.

        <p>To biologically validate all immunohistological stainings, control tissues with known expression pattern harboring or lacking the expected antigens were used (Supplemantary Figure 3). Immunohistochemical staining for S100 protein within normal (nondiseased) autopsy brain tissue depicts glial cells such as astrocytes and neurons, while endothelial cells are spared. The positive control tissue for Olig2, which is known to show nuclear immunoreactivity in glioma tumor cells, while endothelial cells are not reactive to Olig2. HLA-DR immunoreactivity in the brain even under non-pathologic conditions is typically found on CNS-intrinsic myeloid cells, namely microglia, while e.g. neural/neuronal cells show no positivity for HLA-DR. All neuroepithelial cells in the CNS demonstrate a strong immunoreactivity for CD56, which cannot be found on endothelial cells. Tonsils were used to serve as positive control tissue for the general leukocyte marker CD45, while connective tissue of the capsula is not stained. The epithelium in a nondiseased skin sample shows strong immunoreactivity for the pan-cytokeratin marker AE1/3 in contrast to the surrounding connective tissue.

        <p>The median age at death was 71.6 years (IQR: 67 -79, range: 30 to 98 years), and the time from onset of COVID-19 symptoms to death ranged from 4 to 79 days, with a median of 31 days. Cases were not preselected with regard to clinical and/or neurological symptoms, which due to the pandemic situation in some instances were not fully documented or not possible to retrieve. Clinically documented COVID-19-associated neurologic alterations were impaired consciousness (N=5 patients), intraventricular hemorrhage (N=2), headache (N=2) and behavioral changes (N=2); acute cerebral ischemia was reported for 2 patients, while neuropathological postmortem workup revealed acute infarcts in 6 patients (Supplementary Table 2). Coexisting conditions included diabetes mellitus (N=4), hypertension (N=21), cardiovascular disease (N=9), hyperlipidemia (N=2), chronic kidney disease (N=2), prior stroke (N=6), and dementia (N=5) (Supplementary Table 1). Although all 33 patients required mechanical ventilation and at time of autopsy suffered from COVID-19-associated lung disease, nine did not receive mechanical ventilation due to the respective patients' will. a Recruitment not applicable/see aboveThe median age at death was 71.6 years (IQR: 67 -79, range: 30 to 98 years), and the time from onset of COVID-19 symptoms to death ranged from 4 to 79 days, with a median of 31 days.
