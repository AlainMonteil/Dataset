        <p>Light is an attractive tool that has a profound impact on modern medicine. Particularly, light-based photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) show great application prospects in the prevention of wound infection and promoting wound healing. In addition, hydrogels have shown attractive advantages in the field of wound dressings due to their excellent biochemical effects. Therefore, multifunctional photoresponsive hydrogels (MPRHs) that integrate the advantages of light and hydrogels are increasingly used in biomedicine, especially in the field of wound repair. However, a comprehensive review of MPRHs for wound regeneration is still lacking. This review first focuses on various types of MPRHs prepared by diverse photosensitizers, photothermal agents (PHTAs) including transition metal sulfide/oxides nanomaterials, metal nanostructure-based PHTAs, carbon-based PHTAs, conjugated polymer or complex-based PHTAs, and/or photodynamic agents (PHDAs) such as ZnO-based, black-phosphorus-based, TiO 2 -based, and small organic molecule-based PHDAs. We also then discuss how PTT, PDT, and photothermal/photodynamic synergistic therapy can modulate the microenvironments of bacteria to inhibit infection. Overall, multifunctional hydrogels with both therapeutic and tissue regeneration capabilities have been discussed and existing challenges, as well as future research directions in the field of MPRHs and their application in wound management are argued.Light is an attractive tool that has a profound impact on modern medicine.

        <p>Skin, the largest organ in the human body, plays an imperative role in the maintenance of biological homeostasis and protecting the body from harmful materials and microbial invasion. 1,2 Once the skin is damaged or destroyed, the wound will undergo four overlapping stages that include hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling to heal. 3 Hemorrhage occurs immediately after tissue injury because of the rupture of blood vessels. 4 Within a few minutes after the trauma, the aggregation of platelets and the formation of fibrin clots will produce hemostasis, and the wound healing process will quickly turn into the inflammation stage. The cellular response in the inflammatory phase is mainly characterized by the flow of leukocytes into the wound area. Neutrophils (a kind of leukocyte) and monocytes are recruited by chemokines released in the process of hemostasis and by mast cells shortly after injury and emigrate from capillaries to the wounded tissue. 5 Monocytes migrate to the tissue space and transform into macrophages and in the later stage of inflammation, after the white blood cells leave, continue to remove debris and release chemokines (such as fibronectin), attracting fibroblasts to the wound area to guide the healing process into the proliferation phase. The proliferative phase usually starts 2 days after injury. 4 Re-epithelialization, angiogenesis, granulation tissue formation, and collagen deposition are the main steps that constitute this phase. The remodeling phase usually starts on the eighth day after the trauma. 6 In fact, remodeling is also a clinically important stage. The production and decomposition of collagen gradually tends to balance, gradually changing from type III collagen to type I collagen, and deposits in an organized and well-mannered network on this stage, thereby increasing the strength of the regenerated tissue. In addition, the number of capillaries is also reduced and a few are transformed into small arteries and veins. Some skin appendages, such as hair, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands regenerate at this stage. 4 Upon the creation of a defect or wound on the skin, a proper dressing would be needed to achieve rapid closure and healing of the injury. Although most of the skin defects can be healed within 1 or 2 weeks, 7 infected skin wounds, especially fullthickness ones, usually result in severe pain, amputation, and even death. 8 In fact, bacterial infection is one of the most critical challenges in the wound healing process 1,9,10 since serious tissue damage can occur by microorganisms, resulting in severe inflammatory reactions and delayed wound repair. 9,[11][12][13][14] To prevent wound infections, antibiotics have been broadly used in the clinic. However, their overuse/misuse has led to the emergence of multiple drug-resistant (MDR) strains, resulting in the generation of recalcitrant biofilms and chronic wounds. The formed biofilms can protect resident bacteria from external attacks and increase their resistance to antibiotics. 13,15,16 This challenge needs an urgent attempt to develop technologies to accelerate the healing of bacteria-infected wounds. 15,[17][18][19][20][21][22] Compared to the traditional approaches, nanoparticles (NPs) have found tremendous application in wound healing and preventing wound infections. 17 This is mainly due to the tunable physiochemical properties of NPs and the targeting ability of the nanosystems toward bacterial infective sites. 23 For example, NPs are featured by a high surface-to-volume ratio; therefore, the property can enhance their contact and interaction with microorganisms, thus leading to the activation of a broad range of antimicrobial mechanisms and improving their antimicrobial efficacy. 24 Further, the antimicrobial activity of NPs can be influenced by other chemical-physical parameters, including shape and surface modification. 25 Among the NPbased therapeutics, photoresponsive NPs have received considerable attention due to their high bactericidal efficiency through local heating or controlled ROS productions in the infected wound. 26 Light is a particularly appealing tool that has made a profound impact on modern medicine, 27 including drug delivery, photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT), and tissue engineering. 28 This is due to its ease of application, noninvasive nature, and spatiotemporal control. 18,29 Many studies have shown that local hyperthermia generated by PHTAs under light illumination at a specific wavelength could induce the destruction of the bacterial integrity and provide ondemand drug release. 30 This has extensively been used in the treatment of bacteria-accompanied wounds. 9,10,14,[31][32][33] Under PTT, oxygenation can be promoted through increased blood flow, which, in turn, boosts the healing process. 28 In addition, in the PDT, photosensitizers (PSs) combined with light and oxygen can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), 9,14,34 resulting in wound repair by combating infectious microorganisms within the wound environment. Although great achievements have been realized by NP-based systems in the treatment of infected wounds, the risk of unintended toxicity of the nanosystems and their negative effect on the healing process still remains a big challenge; therefore, further investigation should be devoted to addressing this ignored limitation. In that sense, it is highly desirable to develop safe dressings in wound healing while they carry a light-responsive property.Skin, the largest organ in the human body, plays an imperative role in the maintenance of biological homeostasis and protecting the body from harmful materials and microbial invasion. 1,2 Once the skin is damaged or destroyed, the wound will undergo four overlapping stages that include hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling to heal. 3 Hemorrhage occurs immediately after tissue injury because of the rupture of blood vessels. 4 Within a few minutes after the trauma, the aggregation of platelets and the formation of fibrin clots will produce hemostasis, and the wound healing process will quickly turn into the inflammation stage.

        <p>Hydrogels are cross-linked three-dimensional polymer networks that can absorb large amounts of water. 19,21 This type of porous structure is commonly prepared by electrostatic interactions/hydrogen bonding or covalent bonding between their constituent polymer chains. Their degree of porosity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical strength, and stability are tunable, 35 providing excellent regenerative 3D networks to mimic native tissues. Moreover, injectable hydrogels with adhesive properties have the potential to attach and bond the defected tissues together, thus prompting the wound to heal properly. Such dressings can also act as hemostatic agents and prevent the leakage of fluids and gases from the wound area and serve as a sealant to maintain the wound from environmental bacterial infections. 33 Moreover, various therapeutic agents, dyes, PHTAs, and PHDAs can be incorporated inside them to create outstanding candidates in diverse biomedical applications, including cancer therapy, [36][37][38] drug delivery, 39,40 and wound healing. 22,39,41,42 By combining the advantages of hydrogels and PDT/PTT, multifunctional photoresponsive hydrogels (MPRHs) are increasingly used in wound dressing to enhance wound healing.

        <p>In this review, we summarize an overview of the main recent achievements related to multifunctional MPRHs to treat wounds/infected wounds using PHTAs (e.g., Cu NPs), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), CuS, polydopamine (PDA), graphene), and/or PHDA (e.g., Ce6, porphyrins, ZnO NPs, and black phosphorus nanosheets)-incorporated hydrogels under appropriate light irradiation (Figure 1). We will focus on the MPRHs derived from diverse PHTAs and/or PHDAs and discuss how photoactive agents can modulate bacteria-infected microenvironments to kill the microorganisms. The impact of different components of MPRH on four phases of the wound healing process, i.e., hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling, will also be addressed. In addition, we will highlight theragenerative hydrogels with both therapeutic and tissue regeneration capabilities. Finally, a brief perspective on challenges and future research directions in this field will be provided.In this review, we summarize an overview of the main recent achievements related to multifunctional MPRHs to treat wounds/infected wounds using PHTAs (e.g., Cu NPs), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), CuS, polydopamine (PDA), graphene), and/or PHDA (e.g., Ce6, porphyrins, ZnO NPs, and black phosphorus nanosheets)-incorporated hydrogels under appropriate light irradiation (Figure 1).

        <p>PTT is a kind of artificial increasing of tissue temperature with the contribution of PHTAs that can absorb light and convert it into heat to cause the denaturation of protein, the cavitation and rupture of cells, the formation of bubbles, and the fragmentation of DNA, leading to the thermal ablation of the undesired cells at the target site to achieve a good therapeutic effect. [43][44][45] Based on high inherent specificity and low invasive burden, PTT is an attractive and promising local heating approach 46 which can accelerate the blood flow in the wound area, while stimulating the proliferation of fibroblasts and reducing inflammation, thereby accelerating the wound healing process. [47][48][49] As a type of wound dressing, hydrogels, with a microstructure similar to the extracellular matrix, have an active role in wound healing and provide a strategy for wound healing management The optimized molar ratio of Nisopropylacrylamide/acrylamide (95:5) was added to form the hydrogel with N,N′-methylenebis(acrylamide) used as cross-linker, and CuS/ mSiO 2 -MPS NPs were dispersed in deionized water at the required concentration (CH1: 0 mg mL -1 , CH2: 0.5 mg mL -1 , CH3: 1 mg mL -1 , and CH4: 1.5 mg mL -1 ). The polymerization was carried out at room temperature in the presence of ammonium persulfate (APS)/N,N,N′,N′tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) system for 4 h. when combined with PHTAs for PTT. [50][51][52] The main existing PHTAs for the preparation of NIR-responsive hydrogels include transition metal sulfide/oxide nanomaterials (e.g., CuS, 53,54 TiO 2 , 55 and MnO 2 56 ), metal nanostructures (e.g., Cu NPs, Ag NPs, and Au NPs), carbon-based PHTAs (e.g., CNTs and graphene and graphene oxide (GO)), conjugated polymer or complex-based PHTAs, iron(III)-catechol complex, 57 and Prussian blue NPs (PB NPs)). 10 This section has a focus on the PHTA-loaded hydrogels as NIR-responsive platforms with advanced multifunctional properties for wound repair.PTT is a kind of artificial increasing of tissue temperature with the contribution of PHTAs that can absorb light and convert it into heat to cause the denaturation of protein, the cavitation and rupture of cells, the formation of bubbles, and the fragmentation of DNA, leading to the thermal ablation of the undesired cells at the target site to achieve a good therapeutic effect.

        <p>Photothermally Active Hydrogels Based on the Transition Metal Sulfide/Oxide Nanomaterials. Wound healing is an interactive and complex process that requires the participation of a variety of cells, as well as the interaction between the extracellular matrix, cells, and other components such as growth factors and chemokines. 53,54 For example, in the early stage of wound healing, substances such as cytokines, fibrin, and coagulated blood mixture are required to cooperate to stabilize the wound. In addition, the immune cells recruited in the wound area can secrete chemokines and growth factors, which help attract a variety of cells including fibroblasts and keratinocytes to migrate to the wound area, thereby guiding the healing process to the proliferation phase. 2 Moreover, angiogenesis plays an important role in the wound healing process because newly formed blood vessels can provide the transportation of nutrients and oxygen to the tissue. 56 Therefore, the promotion of angiogenesis is one of the most important strategies to promote the healing process. 58 Existing studies have shown that Cu 2+ can stabilize the expression of hypoxia-inducible factors and activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) to enhance angiogenesis. 54,59 Cu 2+ -loaded wound dressings have accelerated skin wound closure by the remodeling of extracellular matrix and upregulated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the wound area. Furthermore, the inherent antibacterial activity of Cu 2+ reduces the risk of wound infection. Therefore, combining Cu 2+ and PTT synergistically endow the dressings with good antibacterial and tissue regeneration capabilities.Photothermally Active Hydrogels Based on the Transition Metal Sulfide/Oxide Nanomaterials.

        <p>Studies have shown that CuS NP-loaded hydrogels have obvious killing effects on Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and the released Cu 2+ could effectively stimulate angiogenesis and the proliferation of fibroblast proliferation. 54,60 Zhou et al. 61 reported a CuSincorporated hyaluronic acid (HA)-based hydrogel (CuS/HA). The hydrogel was formed by the cross-linking of disulfide bonds initiated by hydrogen peroxide oxidizing thiolated groups on the backbone of HA. Based on the good biological activity of the CuS and HA, as well as the desirable NIR-responsive performance of the CuS, in vivo studies showed that animals that received CuS/HA hydrogel under NIR irradiation could create smaller scars with less pigmentation and better recovery compared to the other groups. Completely covered epithelium, more formation of new blood vessels, and enhanced collagen deposition in the group were confirmed through histology and immunohistochemistry staining.Studies have shown that CuS NP-loaded hydrogels have obvious killing effects on Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and the released Cu 2+ could effectively stimulate angiogenesis and the proliferation of fibroblast proliferation. 54,60 Zhou et al. 61 reported a CuSincorporated hyaluronic acid (HA)-based hydrogel (CuS/HA).

        <p>However, incorporation of CuS NPs into hydrogels through simple physical mixing makes it difficult to achieve controllable release of Cu 2+ , and excessive local Cu 2+ accumulation may have a negative impact on wound healing, eventually leading to a delayed healing process. 62 Therefore, further surface functionalization of CuS NPs is expected to improve the stability of Cu 2+ in hydrogels, thereby achieving a controlled release of Cu 2+ to exert a desired biological activity. For example, a NIR-responsive hydrogel composed of mesoporous silica (mSiO 2 ) modified CuS NPs and 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (MPS) was prepared by acrylamide-based polymerization for the controlled release of Cu 2+ (Figure 2A). 63 As shown in Figure 2B, CuS-loaded hydrogels possess small pores with circular morphology. After polymerization, the polymer solution was completely converted into a hydrogel, confirming the radical polymerization mechanism in the hydrogel formation catalyzed by APS/TEMED system (Figure 2C). The NIR-induced photothermal properties of the hydrogels were related to the concentration of the CuS nanocomposites. In addition, repeated NIR irradiation did not significantly affect the photothermal behavior of the hydrogels. The nanocomposite hydrogel showed a triggered faster release rate of Cu 2+ under NIR light irradiation because of the produced local heat under NIR irradiation. 63 Moreover, the N-isopropylacrylamide-based hydrogel with the rapid thermal responsiveness could undergo volume conformation changes by temperature alteration, thus leading to the accelerated release of Cu 2+ from the hydrogel, as well. Figure 2D showed the antibacterial activity of the CuS-loaded hydrogels with or without NIR illumination, and the results revealed that the enhanced antibacterial efficacy was observed in NIRirradiated groups. In addition, the antibacterial efficacy of the corresponding hydrogels boosted significantly with the content of CuS increasing. In general, the same antibacterial trend was observed against E. coli. Such results highlighted the importance of concurrent ROS generation and hyperthermia stemmed from the CuS NPs responsible for the hydrogel's antibacterial properties. The wound treated with CH4 (the hydrogel containing 1.5 mg mL -1 CuS NPs) dressing hydrogels healed after treatment for 2 weeks, but clear defects persisted in the other groups (Figure 2E). In addition, the minimum amount of bacteria was observed in the CH4 group in vivo, as confirmed by Giemsa-stained images. The photoresponsive hydrogel could stimulate angiogenesis and the proliferation of cells to accelerate the process of wound healing. 63 Nevertheless, the hydrogel prepared based on this strategy had poor injectability and required further treatment (such as dialysis) to remove unreacted monomers, which undoubtedly increased the complexity, thus limiting its facile bench to bedside transition. Therefore, the development of NIR-responsive CuS-based hydrogels with good stability, taking into account good injectable behavior, can have great application prospects.However, incorporation of CuS NPs into hydrogels through simple physical mixing makes it difficult to achieve controllable release of Cu 2+ , and excessive local Cu 2+ accumulation may have a negative impact on wound healing, eventually leading to a delayed healing process. 62 Therefore, further surface functionalization of CuS NPs is expected to improve the stability of Cu 2+ in hydrogels, thereby achieving a controlled release of Cu 2+ to exert a desired biological activity.

        <p>In addition to the CuS as PHTAs for the preparation of NIRresponsive wound dressings, other transition metal oxides nanomaterials, including TiO 2 55 and MnO 2 , 56 have been reported for the fabrication of this type of dressing hydrogels. For example, a black titania (B-TiO 2 ) NP-incorporated chitosan (CTS) matrix was prepared as a thermosensitive injectable system (abbreviated as BT-CTS thermogel). 55 Based on B-TiO 2 's crystalline/amorphous core-shell structure, the light absorption of the nanocrystals can be effectively extended to the region of visible and NIR, indicating that the B-TiO 2 -loaded hydrogel can convert light into heat under NIR irradiation. In addition, TiO 2 has been used as a PHDA to induce the generation of ROS under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. In addition, the B-TiO 2 NPs also had the ability to generate ROS when exposed to 808 nm irradiation. Such potential capabilities conferred the B-TiO 2 NPs to simultaneously use in the treatment of skin-tumor-induced therapy and healing, which will be discussed in the next sections in detail. In another study, a light-responsive injectable bioinspired MnO 2 hybrid hydrogel was reported. 56 The photoactive hydrogel was prepared by adding MnO 2 nanosheets to induce the covalent oxidative polymerization of caffeic-acid-functionalized CTS. The MnO 2 nanosheets with broad absorption in the NIR region ensured the good photothermal behavior of the hydrogel and could synergistically catalyze the decomposition of endogenous H 2 O 2 into O 2 to alleviate the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Moreover, various intermolecular interactions between the MnO 2 nanosheets and catechol, e.g., static electricity, π-π, and polar-π interactions, endowed the hydrogel with good mechanical behaviors, such as self-healing and injectability, which further broadened the application prospects of the transition-metal-oxide-based hydrogels.In addition to the CuS as PHTAs for the preparation of NIRresponsive wound dressings, other transition metal oxides nanomaterials, including TiO 2 55 and MnO 2 , 56 have been reported for the fabrication of this type of dressing hydrogels.

In addition, TiO 2 has been used as a PHDA to induce the generation of ROS under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. In addition, the B-TiO 2 NPs also had the ability to generate ROS when exposed to 808 nm irradiation. Such potential capabilities conferred the B-TiO 2 NPs to simultaneously use in the treatment of skin-tumor-induced therapy and healing, which will be discussed in the next sections in detail. In another study, a light-responsive injectable bioinspired MnO 2 hybrid hydrogel was reported. 56 The photoactive hydrogel was prepared by adding MnO 2 nanosheets to induce the covalent oxidative polymerization of caffeic-acid-functionalized CTS. The MnO 2 nanosheets with broad absorption in the NIR region ensured the good photothermal behavior of the hydrogel and could synergistically catalyze the decomposition of endogenous H 2 O 2 into O 2 to alleviate the hypoxic tumor microenvironment.

        <p>Metal Nanostructure-Based Photothermal Agents. Hydrogels containing Cu NPs show photothermal behavior because of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect of the particles, which can turn NIR light into heat. 64 For example, Tao et al. 65 reported Cu NPs contained NIR-active hydrogel. CuSO 4 •5H 2 O was used to synthesize Cu NPs with sodium citrate served as the reducing agent, and disulfidecontaining N,N-bis(acryloyl)cystamine (BACA) was added to obtain the double-bond-modified Cu NPs through the Cu-S bonds. The hydrogel was formed by the free radical polymerization of Cu NPs (double-bond-modified) and methacrylated gelatin-containing double bonds. The combined use of Cu NPembedded composite hydrogels and PTT had broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against Gram-positive/negative bacteria, which could be attributed to the synergistic effect of photothermal antibacterial properties of the hydrogels and the enhanced release of Cu 2+ under the NIR laser irradiation (Figure 2F). 65 First, the local temperature increased through the exposure of Cu NP-loaded hydrogel under 808 nm laser irradiation, thereby inducing physical damage to bacteria. The released Cu 2+ could increase the ROS generation and disturb the integrity of the bacterial membrane. The NIR-irradiated hydrogels showed effective wound closure, and the number of bacteria in the wound area was significantly reduced. Histological analysis also revealed the suppression of inflammatory responses and enhanced angiogenesis in the group that received the Cu NP-embedded hydrogel with NIR irradiation (Figure 2G,H). 65 Ag and Au NPs exhibit strong NIR absorbance due to the LSPR effect similar to Cu NPs. 65 Therefore, the hydrogel wound dressings developed based on Ag and Au NPs show good photothermal behavior and exhibit great potential for treating bacteria-infected wounds. To avoid wound infection caused by bacteria, the most common way is to incorporate antibiotics into the dressings. Although various antibiotics are used, bacterial infection is still one of the many problems that seriously affect human health in the world and it is still challenging, and the widespread application and abuse of antibiotics have further exacerbated the epidemic of antibiotic resistance. 67 Therefore, the development of antibiotic-independent antibacterial wound dressings for the treatment of infected wounds is imminent.Metal Nanostructure-Based Photothermal Agents.

        <p>Among the existing antibacterial agents, Ag NP-based nanomaterials are the most common and well-studied types of antibacterial agents because of their wide antibacterial spectrum that can be effective against a variety of Gram-positive/negative bacteria, fungi, and viruses. [68][69][70][71] Ag NPs have been widely used clinically as antibacterial agents against a variety of microorganisms, especially for burn wound management, which is due to the good antibiotic-independent antibacterial properties of Ag NPs. However, the aggregation properties and easy oxidation of Ag NPs hinder its further antibacterial applications, and therefore, the necessity of improving the stability of Ag NP has increased. 72 A Ag NP-embedded hydrogel was reported for treating bacteria-infected wounds. 66 Gallic acid (GA) served as a green reducing agent to synthesize GA-Ag NPs that exhibited photothermal conversion efficiency (48.7%). In this system, GA-Ag NPs could act as PHTAs with the assistance of NIR radiation, causing thermal damage to bacteria to achieve good antibacterial properties. The synergistic antibacterial hydrogels were further successfully constructed by cross-linking GA-Ag NPs with carrageenan (Figure 2I). 66 Based on the good photothermal behavior of GA-Ag NPs, the prepared hydrogel exhibited excellent light-to-heat conversion behavior. After 10 min of NIR irradiation (power density: 1.5 W cm -2 ), the maximum temperature of the core area of the hydrogel containing 200 μg/mL GA-Ag NPs increased from 17.2 to 49.9 °C. Benefiting from the excellent photothermal properties of GA-Ag NPs and the inherent bactericidal properties of Ag + that released from GA-Ag NPs, the bacteria-killing ratios against S. aureus and E. coli were both higher than 94%. The morphological evaluation of S. aureus and E. coli confirmed that, with the assistance of NIR irradiation, the severe cell membrane was severely damaged and intracellular contents leaked after treatment with GA-Ag NP hydrogel. The GA-Ag NP hydrogels were placed on the back wound of the mouse, and after 2 min of NIR irradiation, it was found that the temperature of the wound area increased sharply from 36.4 to 50.6 °C, which indicated that GA-Ag NP hydrogel had shown great application prospects as a PTT platform for wound healing applications. 66 Further, by implementing S. aureus-infected wounds in a mouse full-thickness infected wound model and continuously monitoring the wound area, it was found that the wound closure rate of GA-Ag NP hydrogel was significantly faster than that of other treatment groups. Hematoxylin/eosin (H&amp;E) staining of skin wound sections showed weakened infiltration of inflammatory cells around the wound after GA-Ag NP hydrogel combined with NIR irradiation treatment. This might be attributed to the enhanced bactericidal activity of the GA-Ag NP hydrogel under the combined treatment to inhibit the inflammatory response, thereby accelerating the wound healing process. In general, the hydrogel prepared based on the above formula exhibited high antibacterial efficiency via the release of Ag + , and the GA-Ag NP could serve as a PHTA to synergistically improve the antibacterial properties of the dressing. 66 Au NPs are also widely used in the field of biomedicine because of their chemical stability, biocompatibility, and high photothermal conversion efficiency. [73][74][75] A multifunctional dopamine-coated Au nanorod (Au@PDA NR)-loaded antibacterial photothermal hydrogel was developed with toughness and high strength (Figure 3A). 76 Au@PDA NRs were obtained through in situ polymerization of dopamine around the Au NRs in an alkaline solution. The core-shell structure of the NRs was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Figure 3B). Furthermore, the Au NR-loaded hydrogel with a relatively smooth surface and a porous structure was developed by thermally induced radical polymerization of N-acryloyl glycinamide (NAGA) solution containing Au NRs (termed as PNAGA-Au@PDA hydrogel).Among the existing antibacterial agents, Ag NP-based nanomaterials are the most common and well-studied types of antibacterial agents because of their wide antibacterial spectrum that can be effective against a variety of Gram-positive/negative bacteria, fungi, and viruses.

        <p>The prepared hydrogels coated with S. aureus or E. colipretreated macrophage membrane (named as S/EMMPNAGA-Au@PDA), where S and E represent the membranes of macrophages by treated S. aureus and E. coli and MM represents for macrophage membrane without any treatment. In vitro studies showed that the hydrogel coated with a pretreated macrophage membrane could specifically recognize the source bacteria, and the bacteria-killing ratio reached 98% within 5 min of NIR irradiation. 76 The bactericidal property was significantly higher than that of the hydrogels which did not coat with the macrophage membrane. Such behavior was attributed to the hydrogel coated with a pretreated macrophage membrane that can specifically bind to the original bacteria and also the high photothermal effect of the NIR-responsive hydrogels. The in vivo photothermal behavior of the Au@PDA-loaded hydrogel was evaluated by implanting the hydrogel into the subcutaneous area on the rat dorsal area followed by the infrared thermal imaging under NIR irradiation. The area where the hydrogel was implanted had a color change and became brighter over time. In contrast, no significant color change was observed in the SMM-PNAGA, indicating that the hydrogel of this formula does not have PHTA that can convert light into heat (Figure 3C).The prepared hydrogels coated with S. aureus or E. colipretreated macrophage membrane (named as S/EMMPNAGA-Au@PDA), where S and E represent the membranes of macrophages by treated S. aureus and E. coli and MM represents for macrophage membrane without any treatment.

SMM-PNAG-Au@PDA hydrogel showed a positive therapeutic effect on bacteria-infected wounds because of its targeted photothermal antibacterial ability, leading to a faster wound closure rate and lower levels of neutrophils and white blood cells.

When the dressing was exposed to NIR irradiation (808 nm), they exhibited good photothermal behavior, stemming mainly from loaded palladium NPs that acted as PHTA to convert the light to heat. 78 In another study, multifunctional neodymium-calcium-silicon bioglass composite hydrogels were prepared using simple mixing of the composites and alginic acid sodium salt. 79 The obtained hydrogel exhibited photothermal properties under NIR irradiation, and it can also emit fluorescence at the same time, and the intensity of fluorescence had a linear correlation with the in situ temperature. 79 These properties were attributed to the neodymium cations, which could generate thermal energy and emit infrared fluorescence under the NIR irradiation. This promising finding allows one to determine the optimal temperature in situ to completely kill the tumor without damaging the surrounding normal tissue during a PTT.

        <p>Carbon-Based Photothermal Agents. The NIR-responsive hydrogel wound dressings developed based on the good photothermal conversion ability of carbon-based nanostructures to treat bacteria-infected wounds have been widely reported. [80][81][82][83] For example, a NIR-responsive hydrogel was reported for on-demand and local delivery of CO 2 by combining the thermally responsive block copolymer of Pluronic F127 and carbon NP-modified with amino groups. 84 The carbon nanostructures could convert light into heat to trigger the decomposition of bicarbonate to produce CO 2 under NIR irradiation when the hydrogels were loaded with bicarbonate as a precursor for releasing CO 2 . Therefore, such photoresponsive hydrogels could release CO 2 locally over the wound bed to accelerate wound healing by improving local microcirculation obstacles and increasing the concentration of tissue oxygen. In addition, N-doped sponge-like carbon spheres were synthesized by the pyrolysis of SiO 2 /polyaniline, and it was shown that they exhibited a variety of enzyme mimicry activity, including peroxidase, oxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activity. Therefore, the sponge-like carbon spheres could not only generate heat after NIR irradiation but also generate a more active surface on the spheres, thereby improving its peroxidaselike activity, thereby generating more ROS to treat the bacteriainfected wound. Overall, the development of the abovementioned carbon-based NIR active hydrogels show good therapeutic effects on wound healing.Carbon-Based Photothermal Agents.

        <p>CNTs with high electronic conductivity, small size, and large surface area can interact with biomolecules, cells, and even natural tissues, thereby significantly enhancing the wound dressing's biological activity. 85 The strong NIR radiation absorbance of CNTs can also endow the dressing with great potential as a photothermal platform for the treatment of wounds. 86,87 For example, He et al. reported a photoresponsive CNT-based hydrogel wound dressing based on the stable photothermal and electronic properties of CNTs. 88 To avoid the integration of individual CNTs in water caused by the strong hydrophobic interaction, benzaldehyde-terminated Pluronic F127 (PF127-CHO) was used to well-disperse individual CNTs under ultrasound. The NIR-responsive hydrogels formed through a Schiff base bond between the -NH 2 groups of Ncarboxyethyl CTS and the -CHO groups of the PF127-CHO, as well as the PF127 micelle physically cross-linked in a single system (Figure 4A). It was shown that, with the addition of CNTs, the photothermal property of the hydrogels improved significantly. The bacteria-killing ratio of the hydrogels containing 2 mg/mL of CNTs was 100% against both S. aureus and E. coli after 10 min of 808 nm laser irradiation. 88 In the in vivo wound healing evaluation in a mouse full-thickness skin wound-infected model, enhanced wound closure healing, angiogenesis, and collagen deposition were observed.

        <p>Cryogels, a kind of hydrogels, undergo controlled polymerization at subzero temperatures to introduce the interconnected macropores into the network of cryogels, which allows cells to grow into them easily, [89][90][91] and cryogels with interconnected macroporous structures allow water molecules to freely flow out/in of the network, which indicates that the free water in the cryogel can be extruded by physical pressing to obtain a shapefixed cryogel, and the fixed cryogel could quickly restore its original shape by absorbing water, thereby showing watertriggered shape memory capability. 92 Based on this characteristic, Zhao et al. developed an injectable conductive and antibacterial cryogel based on CNT-reinforced glycidyl methacrylate functionalized quaternized CTS (QCSG) with excellent NIR stimuli responsivity, robust mechanical property, high blood absorption ability, rapid blood-triggered shape memory capability, and good blood-clotting ability, thereby showing great potential in the field of incompressible hemorrhage (Figure 4B). 93 The presence of CNTs within the hydrogels endowed them with good light-to-heat conversion capability (Figure 4C). It was shown that the bacteria-killing ratio of the hydrogels against E. coli and S. aureus was about 95% after 1 min of NIR light irradiation. A 100% bacteria-killing ratio on the bacteria was obtained by extending the irradiation time to 10 min (Figure 4D,E). Moreover, benefiting from the excellent water-triggered shape memory capability, it could be injected into the bleeding site in a fixed shape and then restored to its original shape in an expanded geometry after contact with the blood. 93 These properties exhibited the great potential of the cryogels as incompressible hemorrhage hemostasis dressing, which was further verified in the mouse-liver injury model, mouse tail amputation model, and in rabbit liver defect lethal noncompressible hemorrhage model. The wound healing performance of the conductive cryogels was studied as well by implementing a full-thickness skin defect model. A faster wound closure rate was observed by the cryogels compared with the cryogels without CNTs (Figure 4F). The histomorphological evaluation confirmed that the wound in QCSG/CNT4 groups showed the least inflammatory infiltration among the treated groups on day 10. In addition, the vascularization in both CNTfree QCSG/CNT0 and QCSG/CNT4 (4 represents the concentration of CNT as mg/mL) groups was higher than the Tegaderm group on day 5 (Figure 4G). The improved wound healing performance of QCSG/CNT4 dressing over CNT-free QCSG/CNT0 dressing may be attributed to the transfer of electrosignals from the cryogel with conductivity to the wound site, thereby increasing the level of growth factors involved in the wound area to accelerate the healing process effectively. 94,95 The above results revealed that the wound healing process could be improved by cryogel through promoting vascularization. Further, the conductive QCSG/CNT4 was likely to further accelerate the healing process by balancing inflammation infiltration. 96 The development of these hemostatic and NIR-responsive cryogels can serve as advanced and multifunctional materials for the emergency treatment of massive bleeding and the development of effective wound dressings.Cryogels, a kind of hydrogels, undergo controlled polymerization at subzero temperatures to introduce the interconnected macropores into the network of cryogels, which allows cells to grow into them easily, [89][90][91] and cryogels with interconnected macroporous structures allow water molecules to freely flow out/in of the network, which indicates that the free water in the cryogel can be extruded by physical pressing to obtain a shapefixed cryogel, and the fixed cryogel could quickly restore its original shape by absorbing water, thereby showing watertriggered shape memory capability. 92 Based on this characteristic, Zhao et al. developed an injectable conductive and antibacterial cryogel based on CNT-reinforced glycidyl methacrylate functionalized quaternized CTS (QCSG) with excellent NIR stimuli responsivity, robust mechanical property, high blood absorption ability, rapid blood-triggered shape memory capability, and good blood-clotting ability, thereby showing great potential in the field of incompressible hemorrhage (Figure 4B). 93 The presence of CNTs within the hydrogels endowed them with good light-to-heat conversion capability (Figure 4C).

In the study, double-bond-modified QCSG (Figure 5A) and methacrylated gelatin (GM) were first synthesized (Figure 5B). 101 Next, the hydrogel was prepared through the radical polymerization of GM and QCSG (named as QCSG/ GM). Furthermore, the QCSG/GM/GO hydrogel was harvested with the incorporation of GO through electrostatic interaction. The excellent properties of each matrix could synergistically impart multiple functions to the hydrogels, such as photothermal and antibacterial properties by the GO and QCSG, respectively (Figure 5C). Furthermore, the actual therapeutic effect of QCSG/GM/GO sample was successfully verified by implementing the methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)-infected wounds in a mouse full-thickness skin woundinfected model. 101 Although GO with hydrophilic groups (e.g., hydroxyl, epoxy, and carboxyl groups) exhibits a better water dispersibility, its conductivity is much lower than that of graphene. 98 To address this issue, rGO-based hydrogel with enhanced conductivity was developed. 33 In the study, first, hyaluronic acid-graf t-dopamine (HA-DA) polymer was prepared through an amidation reaction (Figure 5D). In addition, dopamine was used as a reducing agent to prepare rGO with enhanced conductivity. Dopamine was selfpolymerized at the same time to form a hydrophilic PDA coating on the surface of rGO to improve rGO's dispersion (Figure 5E). Subsequently, rGO loaded into the HA-DA and H 2 O 2 /HPR (horseradish peroxidase) were used as a catalytic system to induce gelation mediated by the oxidized catechol groups of PDA. Such gelation produced adhesive hemostatic, conductive, and injectable composite hydrogels for wound healing applications (Figure 5F). 33 Compared to rGO@PDA-free hydrogels, the conductivity of dry HA-DA/rGO hydrogels greatly increased from 1.2 × 10 -4 to 2.5 × 10 -4 S m -1 after incorporation of rGO@PDA. It was shown that the enhanced conductivity of the hydrogel scaffolds was beneficial for the transmission of electrical signals from living biological tissues and promoted the wound healing process. When the hydrogels were exposed to NIR irradiation, ΔT increased from 11.3 to 14.5 and 17 °C, as the content of rGO@PDA increased from 0.1 to 0.3 and 0.5 mg/mL, thus confirming that the good photothermal performance of the hydrogel originated from rGO@PDA. Subsequently, the NIR-responsive antibacterial properties in the group of rGO@PDA-loaded hydrogels significantly increased under 808 nm irradiation for 1 min. The results showed that the bacterial survival ratio of E. coli was 64.1% and S. aureus was 65.4%, and the killing ratio could almost reach 100% for the above two bacteria when the irradiation time was extended to 10 min. 33 After a mouse full-thickness skin wound model was created, the histology and immunohistochemistry studies confirmed that the multifunctional hydrogels containing 3 wt % of the rGO@PDA exhibited better promotion effect in the healing process by enhancing the thickness of granulation tissue, the deposition of collagen, and simultaneously upregulating production of CD31 and reducing the expression of TNF-α, thus accelerating the rate of wound closure effectively. 33 Conjugated Polymer or Complex-Based Photothermal Agents. Some conjugated polymers with the large πconjugated system such as polypyrrole, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), PDA, and polyaniline endow the dressing with good photothermal properties. [102][103][104] Among the aboveconjugated polymers, PDA with biocompatibility and biodegradability is widely used to develop NIR-responsive hydrogels. Recently, a series of antioxidant, photoactive, antibacterial, and degradable cryogels were prepared. 105 In the study, NaIO 4 was used as an oxidant to initiate the polymerization of dopamine in a precooled CTS polymer solution. The oxidized dopamine could react with the amino group of CTS or itself, and then the network of the dressing was constructed by the physical assembly of dopamine oligomers and covalent bonds (Figure 6A 1 ,A 2 ). 105 The resulting macroporous cryogels showed adjustable and high volume expansion ratio, fast blood-sucking expansion, excellent photothermal behavior, and tunable mechanical strength, thereby endowing the hydrogels a great application prospect in hemostasis and wound healing application. 105 In addition, when the cryogels were exposed to NIR irradiation, the CTS sponge (the cryogels with 0 mg/mL PDA) showed a slight temperature increase after 10 min of NIR irradiation (1.4 W/cm 2 ). For the cryogels with PDA content increased from 1.5 to 7.5 mg/mL, the equilibrium ΔT gradually increased from 10 to 19 °C. In addition, the cryogels possessed good antibacterial properties under NIR light irradiation, causing denaturation of enzymes and destruction of lipids and proteins on cell membranes. The bacteria-killing ratio increased considerably from 30.2 to 89.2% and 30.4 to 87.0% for the S. aureus and E. coli, respectively, only 1 min of NIR irradiation. By further extending the irradiation time to 10 min, both E. coli and S. aureus were completely killed. 105 In addition, the incorporated PDA inside the framework endowed the cryogels with adhesive property and positive binding sites, thus inducing the aggregation of blood cells and the adhesion and activation of platelets. The in vivo wound healing results revealed the cryogels could induce balanced inflammatory infiltration in the early stage of wound healing, promoted vascularization and recruiting cells, thereby accelerating the wound healing process and showing great application prospects in wound healing management. 105 PB NPs, as a kind of complex-based PHTAs, possess excellent surface activity, tunable band gap, high extinction coefficient, desirable photothermal conversion efficiency, excellent biocompatibility, and good biodegradation, thus making the nanostructures promising candidates in biomedicine and biosensing. 106,107 It is also widely used to prepare photoactive nanostructures for cancer therapy. [108][109][110] However, there is relatively few NIR-responsive wound dressing hydrogels developed based on PB NPs. In 2020, a series of glycidyl methacrylate functionalized quaternized CTS-based hydrogels with photothermal properties were prepared as wound dressings by the polymerization of the quaternized CTS solution containing PB NPs (Figure 6B 1 ,B 2 ). 10 A large number of amines and hydroxyl groups in the quaternized CTS copolymer and also the presence of PB NPs in the hydrogel framework improved the mechanical strength of these hydrogels through the electrostatic attractions and the abundant hydrogen bonds. It was shown that the PB-loaded hydrogels exhibited excellent photothermal performance under NIR light irradiation, and the antibacterial ratio of the hydrogels against both S. aureus and E. coli was more than 99% after 20 min of NIR irradiation (0.3 W/cm 2 ). This performance was related to the hyperthermia produced during the antibacterial tests, which destroyed the bacterial membrane and subsequently denatured the proteins on the cell membranes of bacteria, thereby effectively killing the bacteria. 10 Iron(III)-catechol complexes or iron(III)-tannic acid complexes with good biocompatibility, biodegradability, and efficient photothermal conversion properties have shown great potential to develop NIR-responsive dressing hydrogels. 57,[111][112][113][114] In a recently published study, an iron(III)catechol complex-based hydrogel was used for infected wound healing and postwound closure. 115 Preparation of the hydrogel wound dressings based on a Schiff base reaction between the amino group of the QCS and the aldehyde group of the protocatechualdehyde (PA) as well as the coordination of Fe and the aldehyde group are shown in Figure 7A 1 ,A 2 . It is worth mentioning that hydrogels avoid complex synthesis or modification during the synthesis process, so the preparation process was simple, and the hydrogel exhibited a variety of biological functions, such as adhesive, antibacterial, and antioxidant properties (Figure 7A 3 ). When the hydrogels were irradiated by NIR, the temperature of the hydrogels reached ∼45 °C. There was almost no temperature increase in pure QCS, as well (Figure 7B), thus such hyperthermia stemmed from the iron(III)-catechol complex cross-linked QCS. The hydrogels with good photothermal properties showed effective in vivo antibacterial properties. 115 As shown in Figure 7C, no obvious bacterial reduction was shown in the control group with or without NIR intervention and in the hydrogel treatment group without NIR irradiation. In contrast, the number of bacteria in the hydrogel with the NIR irradiation treatment group was significantly reduced. Subsequent wound healing results showed that although the wounds of the experimental groups were almost completely healed after 3 weeks, the actual treatment effect of the hydrogel with NIR irradiation group was significantly better than that of the other groups (Figure 7D). Such a finding was specifically manifested by H&amp;E staining as more fibroblast migration and less inflammatory cell infiltration, more blood vessels, and hair follicle regeneration (Figure 7E). The good wound healing ability of the hydrogel was mainly attributed to the inherent antibacterial activity of QCS and protocatechualdehyde, The near-infrared-assisted photothermal therapy can synergistically enhance the antibacterial ability of the dressing. 115 In another study, a physical double network removable hydrogel with high healing efficiency and NIRresponsive antibacterial properties was reported. 57 The hydrogel was prepared based on quadruple hydrogen bonding crosslinked ureido-pyrimidinone-modified gelatin and catechol-Fe 3+ coordination cross-linked poly(glycerol sebacate)-co-poly-(ethylene glycol)-g-catechol. The heat maps after 10 min of NIR irradiation confirmed that the temperature of the hydrogel group containing the catechol-Fe 3+ complex increased significantly. The achievement confirmed that the hydrogels had good photothermal properties based on the efficient NIR absorption and thermal conversion effect of coordinated catechol-Fe 3+ . It is worth mentioning that the fluidity of the hydrogel network gradually increased after NIR irradiation, thus showing NIR irradiation-assisted removability, which undoubtedly simplified the noninvasive replacement of the dressings in wound healing applications. This feature was mainly attributed to the temperature sensitivity of the coordination and hydrogen bonding in the hydrogel network. In fact, when the hydrogel was exposed to NIR irradiation, the degree of cross-linking of coordination and hydrogen bonding weakened because of the temperature increase, thus resulting in a weakening in the stiffness of the hydrogels.Recently, Liang et al. reported a type of GO-incorporated hydrogel. In the study, double-bond-modified QCSG (Figure 5A) and methacrylated gelatin (GM) were first synthesized (Figure 5B). 101 Next, the hydrogel was prepared through the radical polymerization of GM and QCSG (named as QCSG/ GM). Furthermore, the QCSG/GM/GO hydrogel was harvested with the incorporation of GO through electrostatic interaction. The excellent properties of each matrix could synergistically impart multiple functions to the hydrogels, such as photothermal and antibacterial properties by the GO and QCSG, respectively (Figure 5C). Furthermore, the actual therapeutic effect of QCSG/GM/GO sample was successfully verified by implementing the methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)-infected wounds in a mouse full-thickness skin woundinfected model. 101 Although GO with hydrophilic groups (e.g., hydroxyl, epoxy, and carboxyl groups) exhibits a better water dispersibility, its conductivity is much lower than that of graphene. 98 To address this issue, rGO-based hydrogel with enhanced conductivity was developed. 33 In the study, first, hyaluronic acid-graf t-dopamine (HA-DA) polymer was prepared through an amidation reaction (Figure 5D).

Such gelation produced adhesive hemostatic, conductive, and injectable composite hydrogels for wound healing applications (Figure 5F). 33 Compared to rGO@PDA-free hydrogels, the conductivity of dry HA-DA/rGO hydrogels greatly increased from 1.2 × 10 -4 to 2.5 × 10 -4 S m -1 after incorporation of rGO@PDA. It was shown that the enhanced conductivity of the hydrogel scaffolds was beneficial for the transmission of electrical signals from living biological tissues and promoted the wound healing process.

        <p>PDT is a minimally invasive strategy that utilizes lightresponsive PSs with appropriate excitation sources to generate ROS. The produced ROS can damage surrounding biomolecules, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids through an oxidation process, thus killing pathogenic microorganisms. 15,116 Depending on the ROS formed, PDT is classified into two mechanisms, i.e., type I and type II (Figure 8). The PSs utilized in PDT are normally in a ground electronic singlet state ( 1 PS 0 ) and become excited to a short-lived singlet state ( 1 PS*) after irradiation with a certain wavelength of light. The electron first reaches the long-lived (∼10 -2 ) triplet state ( 3 PS*) through a well-known process called intersystem crossing. 28 The 3 PS* directly transfers one electron to the adjacent substrates including the cell membrane, lipid, protein, or even other PS molecules to generate free radicals or radical ions, such as • O 2 and • OH (type I mechanism). In the type II mechanism, molecular oxygen can be directly converted into singlet oxygen 1 O 2 by 3 PS* through energy transfer to effectively kill bacteria (Figure 8). 15 Commonly, PSs are classified into two categories, i.e., organic and inorganic PSs. Organic PSs mainly include macrocyclic compounds, e.g., porphyrins, phthalocyanines, indocyanine dyes, phenothiazines, and the PSs with aggregation-induced luminescence properties. ZnO, TiO 2 , and graphene quantum dots (GQDs) include in the inorganicbased PSs. 15 For example, it has been shown that GQDs boosted the acceleration of the wound healing process by promoting angiogenesis and eliminating microbial infection. [117][118][119][120][121] GQDs possess higher peroxidase-like activity due to their excellent electron transportation property, thus improving the antibacterial performance. 119 Significant increase in angiogenesis, collagen synthesis, and thickness of skin layers has been reported in accelerated burn wound healing in Wistar rats using GQDs. 120 With the development of PSs and their formulations, they are considered as one of the most promising approaches to eliminate bacterial infections, particularly those induced by MDR bacteria. 15 In addition, ROS can also effectively eradicate biofilms through oxidative damages to excretive products, such as proteins and nucleic acids. 23,122,123 However, due to the low stability of PSs under physiological conditions, poor water solubility, and photostability, most of the PSs cannot remain in the defect site for repeated photodynamic stimulation. 34 In order to overcome this limitation, PSs are incorporated within various carriers like hydrogels. Taking the excellent advantages of hydrogels in wound healing applications, the development of effective PS-loaded hydrogels with potent bactericidal and healing properties is of paramount importance especially the wounds after surgical intervention. [124][125][126][127][128][129] In addition, severe tissue damage can occur after wound infection by microorganisms especially S. aureus bacteria followed by inflammatory reactions. Therefore, accelerated wound treatment using effective antimicrobial wound dressings to minimize bacterial infections has recently gained much attention. 9,11,14,96 In the following section, we will focus on the recent developments of PS-loaded hydrogels based on the type of PS-incorporated hydrogels for the healing of infected wounds.PDT is a minimally invasive strategy that utilizes lightresponsive PSs with appropriate excitation sources to generate ROS.

        <p>ZnO-Based Photodynamic Hydrogels. Due to the production of ROS by ZnO nanomaterials, they have been widely used as excellent antimicrobial agents. [130][131][132] In addition, Zn 2+ released from such nanosystems can stimulate the production of fibroblasts and immune cells, which play a crucial role during skin regeneration. 133,134 Given the rapid recombination of charge carriers and the low charge separation efficiency, pure ZnO NPs usually show relatively low light to energy conversion efficiency. To circumvent this deficiency, Ag/ Ag@AgCl/ZnO hybrid nanostructures embedded within carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) hydrogels were used to prompt the wound healing process. 14 In fact, the Ag/Ag@AgCl nanosystem improved the antibacterial and photocatalytic activity of ZnO NPs through elevating ROS production efficiency (Figure 9A). The Ag NP-coated Ag@AgCl (indicated as Ag/Ag@AgCl) had cube-like morphology, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. It was shown that one-dimensional ZnO nanorods were detectable on the Ag/ Ag@AgCl nanostructures after ZnO doping (named as Ag/Ag@ AgCl/ZnO). The swelling-shrinking performance of the multifunctional hydrogels showed that hydrogels were pHsensitive and had a diameter in the neutral condition that was larger than that in the acidic environment. This behavior is related to the protonation of the carboxylate groups of CMC at the pH ∼2. Zn 2+ release from the nanocomposite hydrogels was also pH-dependent with a much larger release in the acidic environment. The same trend of Ag + release was observed from the Ag-containing hydrogels. 14 Antibacterial activity of the photoactive hydrogels against E. coli and S. aureus was assessed by TEM analysis. Different degrees of cell wall damage and loss of intracellular substrates were detected due to the penetration of Zn 2+ and Ag + into the bacteria. After irradiation for 5 min with simulated sunlight, electron spin resonance (ESR) studies showed that the generation of singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) and hydroxyl radicals by the photodynamically active Ag/Ag@AgCl/ZnO hydrogel were significantly higher than that of the pure ZnO hydrogel. This indicated that the deposition of Ag/Ag@AgCl on ZnO nanostructures could boost the photoactivity of ZnO, thus increasing the production of ROS (Figure 9B). As shown in Figure 9C,D, the Ag/Ag@AgCl nanocomposite enhanced the antibacterial activity of ZnO against both E. coli and S. aureus upon exposure to simulated visible light. ROS generation is proposed to be the dominant antibacterial mechanism, as confirmed by the ESR results. 14 In vivo assessments on a wound model showed significant healing in a 14-day period when Ag/ Ag@AgCl/ZnO and ZnO hydrogels were used as wound dressings, while poor healing was observed for the CMC and Ag/Ag@AgCl hydrogel groups. The immunohistological imaging of the skin showed many neutrophils (red arrows) accumulated in the defect site of the all groups after 2 day treatment, indicating stimulation of the immune system to produce immune cells to fight against the infection caused by S. aureus bacteria (Figure 9E). The loss of connective tissues (red rectangles) and abundant dead cell debris (black arrows) were observed in the control, Ag/Ag@AgCl, and group with ZnO (Figure 9E). In contrast, an enhanced number of newborn blood vessels (blue arrows) and dermal fibroblasts (green arrows) were observed in the Ag/Ag@AgCl/ZnO treated group on day 4 (Figure 9E). The observation was related to Zn 2+ release, which stimulated the production of fibroblasts. Compared to other groups, significant increased connective tissue (black rectangles) was detected in the Ag/Ag@AgCl/ZnO group on day 8 (Figure 9E). The appearance of infected necrotic foci (cyan rectangles) in groups H1 and H2 on day 14 (Figure 9E) demonstrated the excellent therapeutic ability of the Ag/Ag@AgCl/ZnOembedded hydrogel in wound healing. 14 This study clearly showed how photodynamic therapy and synergistic antibacterial effects stemming from the release of Ag + and Zn 2+ , and consequently, stimulation of the immune system can help to design and fabricate advanced hydrogels to treat infected wounds.ZnO-Based Photodynamic Hydrogels.

Compared to other groups, significant increased connective tissue (black rectangles) was detected in the Ag/Ag@AgCl/ZnO group on day 8 (Figure 9E). The appearance of infected necrotic foci (cyan rectangles) in groups H1 and H2 on day 14 (Figure 9E) demonstrated the excellent therapeutic ability of the Ag/Ag@AgCl/ZnOembedded hydrogel in wound healing. 14 This study clearly showed how photodynamic therapy and synergistic antibacterial effects stemming from the release of Ag + and Zn 2+ , and consequently, stimulation of the immune system can help to design and fabricate advanced hydrogels to treat infected wounds.</p>
        <p>Black Phosphorus-Based Photodynamic Hydrogels. Recently, two-dimensional nanosheets, including transition metal dichalcogenides, 135 graphene, 69 hexagonal boron nitride, 136 graphitic C 3 N 4 , 137 2D clay materials, 138 and MXenes, 139 exhibiting optical, electrical, and thermal properties has gained huge attention in biomedical applications. [140][141][142][143][144][145] Among them, black phosphorus (BP) exhibits tunable band gap and excellent biocompatibility. 107 In addition, BP, as a semiconductor, possesses a thickness-dependent band gap ranging from about 0.3 eV for bulk to 2.0 eV for a single layer, allowing them to absorb a broad range of light in the visible region. Therefore, this property enabled the few-layer BPs to produce 1 O 2 , acting as a photosensitizer in PDT applications. Recently, the use of BP-embedded chitosan hydrogels (BP@ CS) for PDT of infected wounds via accelerating regenerative activities of the skin cells and eradicating of bacteria through the 1 O 2 generation under visible light irradiation was introduced. 9 Using ESR analysis, 1 O 2 generation by BP@CS hydrogel during visible light illumination was confirmed by a three-linesspectrum containing relative intensities of 1:1:1 (Figure 10A). This property endowed the hydrogels with significant antibacterial efficacy (99.51% against S. aureus and 98.90% against E. coli), attributed to the rapid ROS production from the BPs under the light irradiation (Figure 10B). In vitro cytotoxicity of BP@CS hydrogel on NIH-3T3 cells showed that the cells could proliferate after 3 and 7 days of coculture, demonstrating excellent biocompatibility of the hydrogels. Increased expression of α-actin was observed in the cells exposed to BP@CS hydrogel, thus enhancing fibroblast proliferation and differentiation into myofibroblasts. In addition, the hydrogels enhanced the expression of collagen type III in the growth of the NIH-3T3 cell, which is crucial for basement membrane regeneration and granulation tissue reorganization during wound healing process. 9 After treatment for 14 days, the CS-BP group was significantly healed under the light illumination. This fact demonstrated rapid sterilization created by 1 O 2 generation stemming from BPs in the presence of light during the wound healing process. In addition, abundant inflammatory cells were observed in all groups after 2 and 4 days of treatment by H&amp;E studies at both dark and light (Figure 10C). After the 14 days of treatment, cell vacuolization of each skin layer was observed in the control, CS, and 3M wound dressing groups (at both dark and light). In contrast, under light irradiation, the CS-BP group exhibited normal tissues without any inflammatory cells, cell vacuolization, and monolayer keratinocytes (Figure 10C). As demonstrated by Giemsa staining, significant bacteria appeared in the control group, 3M wound dressing (both dark and light), and CS-BP group (at dark) after 2 days of treatment (green arrows) (Figure 10C). Interestingly, infection or bacteria completely disappeared in the CS-BP + light treatment group. Using Western blot analysis, it demonstrated that CS-BP treatments could trigger signaling pathways of phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and ERK, thus resulting in boosted fibroblast proliferation and differentiation (Figure 10D,E). 146 In addition, as confirmed by immunohistochemical staining, CS-BP treatments significantly enhanced the fibrinogen formation compared to the other groups; thus, the synergistic effects accelerated wound healing and enhanced skin regeneration. 111 TiO 2 -Based Photodynamic Hydrogels. TiO 2 has extensively been used as a PDT agent with excellent killing activity against pathogens in the ultraviolet wavelength range. 17,147 However, it suffers from a weak antibacterial effect in the visible area, which can be improved by doping small amounts of Ag in TiO 2 via the improvement of ROS generation in the visible area as well as decreasing the toxicity through the reduced release of Ag ions by TiO 2 . 148,149 In a study, Ag/TiO 2 NP-incorporated poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel was used for the promotion of infected wound healing through light-irradiated ROS generation. 150 First, Ag/TiO 2 NPs were synthesized via a chemical reduction process, and then the photoresponsive hydrogel was prepared by dispersion of the TiO 2 nanocomposites in PVA followed by freeze-thaw cycles five times (Figure 11A). Figure 11B represents the electron microscopy images of the uniform Ag/TiO 2 NPs with an average diameter of less than 100 nm and Ag and Ag 2 O doping on TiO 2 . Ag/TiO 2incorporated hydrogels showed interconnected porous structures with 1 to 3 μm pore size, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy mapping confirmed the homogeneous distribution of the Ag on the surface of TiO 2 . As an important criterion for wound healing acceleration, the Ag/TiO 2 -incorporated PVA hydrogel exhibited favorable water adsorption capacity. The hybrid hydrogel (HD) showed no antibacterial activity with and without light irradiation within 5 min. In addition, the release of Ag + from Ag/TiO 2 -incorporated was not enough to reach the minimum threshold of antibacterial effect within 5 min under visible light (VL). In contrast, the antibacterial activity of HD under 606 VL irradiation was Ag concentration-dependent and significantly killed bacteria in a short time (Figure 11C). The bacterial killing of the 0.5% Ag/TiO 2 HD was due to the induction of cell wall damage of bacteria due to the generation of 1 O 2 and • OH, while pure hydrogel and TiO 2 HD did not show such impact. The Ag/TiO 2 -incorporated hydrogel exhibited good cytocompatibility; however, with increasing the amount of Ag up to 1%, slight cytotoxicity was observed. 150 In addition, the histomorphological assay showed a significantly lower amount of lymphocyte accumulation (red arrow) in the wound area of animals treated with 0.5% HD as compared with control, 3M wound dressing, and TiO 2 HD groups (Figure 11D). H&amp;E staining of the soft tissues surrounding the wounds showed that numerous lymphocytes (indicated by red arrow) could be observed in the control, 3M, and TiO 2 HD groups after 2 days of treatment, which is the characteristics of tissue infection (Figure 11E). In addition, Giemsa staining confirmed this type of infection within the infected tissue. In contrast, the number of lymphocytes in the tissues treated by Ag/TiO 2 -incorporated hydrogel was decreased obviously compared to that of the other groups. After 14 days of the treatment, there were few lymphocytes in all groups because of the eradication of all bacteria by the immune system. In addition, compared to other groups, a low number of necrotic areas (indicated by the orange arrow) was observed in the tissues treated by Ag/TiO 2decorated hydrogel. This fact confirmed the photoactive hydrogel could rapidly kill bacteria to maintain the tissue from destruction by bacteria.Black Phosphorus-Based Photodynamic Hydrogels.

        <p>Small Organic Molecule-Based Photodynamic Hydrogels. Sinoporphyrin sodium (DVDMS) is an organic PS, exhibiting high singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) yield, antibacterial property, and fluorescence imaging ability. Like most organic PSs, it is not sufficiently stable under physiological conditions, thus limiting its photodynamic activity. [151][152][153] In 2020, the DVDMS-incorporated carboxymethyl CTS (CMCS)-sodium alginate (CS) hydrogel was used to increase the photoactivity of DVDMS. Such incorporation boosted the photodynamic antibacterial effect of the PS under mild illumination (30 J/ cm 2 , 5 min). 34 In addition, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-encapsulated basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) nanospheres were loaded within the hydrogels to improve reepithelization, angiogenesis, and collagen synthesis during burn infections healing. The DVDMS and bFGF-loaded hydrogel (CSDP hydrogel) was prepared by the reaction of CS and SA under the catalysis of 1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl) carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide (Figure 12A). It was found that the catalytic system decreased the gelation time, improved rheological properties, and increased the tensile strength of the hydrogel through amide bond formation between CMCS units. Similar to CS hydrogel, SEM images showed that the CSDP hydrogel had an interconnected porous structure. The release of DVDMS from the hydrogels at pH 6.8 was much higher than pH 7.4. pH value in wound areas (∼6.8) is lower than the physiological environment of the adjacent tissues (∼7.4). The pH-controlled release property enhanced the accumulation of DVDMS in the infected wound and prompted the photodynamic antibacterial property of the hydrogel (Figure 12B). Such bactericidal behavior was obtained through ROS production under mild irradiation (5 min, 30 J/cm 2 ) against S. aureus and MDR-S. aureus in vitro. 34 The CSDP showed excellent hemostatic performance in a hemorrhaging mouseliver model (Figure 12C). This performance is attributed to the CTS chains, which could bind to the negatively charged membranes of platelets and erythrocytes. 154 SEM images demonstrated that S. aureus and MDR-S. aureus treated with CS, DVDMS, and CSDP in the absence of 30 J/cm 2 light were largely unaffected (Figure 12D). In contrast, under photodynamic conditions and exposure to light, the biofilm network was highly weakened and single bacterial colonies appeared. These results confirmed the antibiofilm property of the photoresponsive hydrogels. Furthermore, these results were also confirmed by SYTO 9/PI staining, showing an increased relative proportion of dead cells in the CSDP plus light group (Figure 12E). 34 In vivo wound healing studies proved that compared with 57.37, 79.55, and 83.37% wound closure in free DVDMS, DVDMS-hydrogel (CSD), and the control group, respectively, quantitative wound closure in the group of CSDP under the light irradiation was 100%. Such excellent performance of the hydrogel was related to antimicrobial effects, high water content, as well as bFGF release from the hydrogels to regulate re-epithelization, angiogenesis, and collagen synthesis during wound healing process. Hierarchical structures of dermis and epidermis were also observed in the CSD and CSDP groups under the light illumination (indicated as blue and red arrows) and confirmed by H&amp;E staining of the excised skin tissues 21 days post-treatments (Figure 12F). In contrast, the other groups did not exhibit any clear epidermal layer (indicated as a yellow arrow) and refuged abundant neutrophils (indicated as a green arrow) in the dermis. Widespread collagen was observed in the wounds treated with CSDP under the photodynamic condition, confirmed by Masson trichome staining (Figure 13G). Furthermore, the number of hair follicles (indicated as black circles) and the proliferation of fibroblasts in the wound area was significantly increased in the CSDP group irradiated by 30 J/cm 2 light. 34 This light-responsive multifunctional CSDP hydrogel with antibacterial and theranostic properties can treat burnassociated skin infections.Small Organic Molecule-Based Photodynamic Hydrogels.

        <p>In 2020, CMC with fucoidan/alginates, gellan gum-loaded hydrogel incorporated chlorin e6 (Ce6) as PHDA was used to fabricate a photodriven hydrogel for accelerated wound healing. 155 The photomediated treatment promoted cell migration confirmed by increased cell proliferation in selected skin cell lines. Faster-wound healing by enhancing fibroblast and collagen content was proved by staining methods. In addition, Western blot proved higher protein expression levels in the selected protein for the wound-healing effects. In fact, in the presence of laser irradiation (4 J/cm 2 , power = 100 mW), the hydrogel inhibited inflammation, as well as induced cell proliferation and differentiation could improve the wound healing process. Using immunohistochemistry studies, it was clearly found that the laser-treated group boosted EGFR and TGF-β1 markers, which were a good indication of fibroblast cells in the dermis layer and collagen deposition, respectively. Although promising, antimicrobial investigations of the hydrogel were lacking, which are indispensable studies in the healing process.In 2020, CMC with fucoidan/alginates, gellan gum-loaded hydrogel incorporated chlorin e6 (Ce6) as PHDA was used to fabricate a photodriven hydrogel for accelerated wound healing. 155 The photomediated treatment promoted cell migration confirmed by increased cell proliferation in selected skin cell lines.

        <p>As known, most of the organic PSs are not stable in physiological conditions, thus limiting their effect as PHDA in biomedical applications. 156,157 In comparison with traditional PSs, organic luminogens with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics showed aggregation boosted ROS generation property, thus confirming their potential applications in PDT. [157][158][159] Luminogens with AIE characteristics (AIEgens) usually exhibit bright fluorescence in the aggregate or solid state. 160 In fact, AIEgens (e.g., tetraphenylsilole 161 or tetraphenylethane 162 ) in the molecular state exhibited negligible fluorescence due to quenching of the excited state via motions of rotatable or vibratile moieties of the AIEgens. In contrast, in the aggregate state, all of the motions are restricted due to short intermolecular distance among the twisted structures, thus protecting excitons from nonradiative decay, endowing the specific structures with enhanced fluorescence. 163 It should be added that molecules with AIE characteristics often have a propeller-like configuration. 160,161 Therefore, the restriction of intramolecular motions is the main mechanism of AIE property. 163,164 In addition, it is promising to develop AIE PSs which can be used to produce ROS effectively from the aggregate state. 165,166 One important strategy to produce aggregated state is to incorporate electron-accepting and electron-donating moieties into two compounds of AIEgens. 160 Berberine chloride (BBR) exhibited AIE characteristics generating ROS under white light irradiation. 167 In a study, a hybrid hydrogel with AIE performance was constructed through the self-assembly of commercial N-(9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)-L-phenylalanine (Fmoc-F) and BBR. BBR self-assembled into NPs, which dispersed throughout the photodynamically active hydrogel prepared by the self-assembly of Fmoc-F amino acid, endowing the BBR NP-incorporated hydrogel with ROS generation capability for PDT of infected wound (Figure 13A). 168 TEM images of the Fmoc-F/BBR hydrogel showed intertwined nanofibers containing BBR-decorated NPs with diameters of ∼10.9 ± 2.3 nm in size (Figure 13B). Due to AIE behavior and 1 O 2 generation of the hydrogels under white light irradiation, promising antibacterial and antibiofilm activity against both S. aureus and E. coli bacteria were realized by the PDT pathway. In addition, excellent healing was observed by the photoresponsive Fmoc-F/BBR hydrogels on infected wounds in vivo (Figure 13C). In vivo antibacterial activity of Fmoc-F/BBR and Fmoc-F/BBR+NIR in the skin wound showed that the number of bacteria in Fmoc-F/BBR+NIR group was significantly lower than those of in other groups. Compared to the rats treated by the hydrogels the group receiving white light, the number of bacterial colonies was less than the group treated under dark condition, confirming the important role of the light illumination on the killing of S. aureus. In addition, after 1 day, there was almost no colony in the spleen and liver of the group treated by PDT, suggesting phototherapy as potent therapy to inhibit internal bacterial infections (Figure 13D). 168 H&amp;Estained images on day 7 exhibited some congestion in the control group, while the other groups showed new fibroblast proliferation and collagen formation in the wound area (Figure 13E). In addition, similar to normal skin tissue, newly generated vessels were observed in the Fmoc-F/BBR+NIR group, confirming that the Fmoc-F/BBR hydrogel had efficient photodynamic antibacterial property to eliminate bacteria in the infected wounds under white light irradiation.As known, most of the organic PSs are not stable in physiological conditions, thus limiting their effect as PHDA in biomedical applications. 156,157 In comparison with traditional PSs, organic luminogens with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics showed aggregation boosted ROS generation property, thus confirming their potential applications in PDT.

        <p>PHOTOTHERMAL/PHOTODYNAMIC SYNERGISTIC THERAPY Phototherapy systems, including PDT and PTT, have attracted wide attention for tissue disinfection due to their controllability, penetrability, and excellent antibacterial activities. 14,[169][170][171] However, through a single PTT, a higher temperature is required to achieve effective antibacterial killing, thus may cause serious side effects to normal tissues. 172,173 On the other hand, for PDT, abundant ROS is needed to kill most bacteria through a single PDT. Therefore, excessive ROS may be dangerous to normal tissues during PDT, including inflammation, fibrosis, and even necrosis. 132,[174][175][176][177][178] Therefore, it is highly essential to develop alternative strategies to employ photothermal/photodynamic synergistic therapy (PTDT) for rapid disinfection, i.e., moderate PDT with limited ROS and PTT with lower temperature during the infected wound healing process. In fact, the PTDT improves the bacterial membrane permeability via increased local heat, then the generated ROS through PDT route can easily permeate the bacteria cell wall to oxidize intracellular proteins and disrupt bacterial homeostasis. 135,179 In the following section, we describe recent studies of PTDT, fabricated by a combination of diverse PHTA and PHDA as platforms for wound healing applications under appropriate light illumination. Classification of the PTDT will be based on the type of PHTA used.PHOTOTHERMAL/PHOTODYNAMIC SYNERGISTIC THERAPY Phototherapy systems, including PDT and PTT, have attracted wide attention for tissue disinfection due to their controllability, penetrability, and excellent antibacterial activities. 14,[169][170][171] However, through a single PTT, a higher temperature is required to achieve effective antibacterial killing, thus may cause serious side effects to normal tissues. 172,173 On the other hand, for PDT, abundant ROS is needed to kill most bacteria through a single PDT.

In fact, the PTDT improves the bacterial membrane permeability via increased local heat, then the generated ROS through PDT route can easily permeate the bacteria cell wall to oxidize intracellular proteins and disrupt bacterial homeostasis. 135,179 In the following section, we describe recent studies of PTDT, fabricated by a combination of diverse PHTA and PHDA as platforms for wound healing applications under appropriate light illumination. Classification of the PTDT will be based on the type of PHTA used.</p>
        <p>Polydopamine-Based Photothermal/Photodynamic Synergistic Therapy. Because of its broad absorption from the visible to NIR wavelengths (300-1000 nm), PDA exhibits an excellent photothermal property. 180 In a study, synergistic effects of both PDT and PTT using carbon quantum dotdecorated ZnO (C/ZnO) nanocomposites embedded within PDA-folic acid (FA)-Zn hydrogel (named as DFT-C/ZnOhydrogel) in bacteria-infected wound healing was investigated. 181 DFT-hydrogel was prepared by gelation of PDA and FA through their cross-linking by Zn 2+ ions (Figure 14A). The porous structure of DFT-hydrogel with a diameter of 50-60 μm is shown by SEM (Figure 14B). Rheological analysis of the hydrogels showed that storage modulus was uniformly higher than loss modulus, revealing that the hydrogels were stable and exhibited good mechanical properties. Due to the presence of PDA and C/ZnO quantum dots within acting as PHTAs, the final temperature of the DFT-C/ZnO-hydrogel could increase to 55 °C upon irradiation with both 808 and 660 nm light, which was higher than the DFT-hydrogel containing single PHTA (Figure 14C). 181 Under the coirradiations, the DFT-hydrogel was unable to generate ROS, while DFT-C/ZnO-hydrogel could produce a large amount of ROS, demonstrating that C/ ZnO served as a strong photocatalyst in the hydrogels (Figure 14D). Mechanistically, the CQDs are able to convert light with a long wavelength (≥600 nm) to short-wavelength light (&lt;400 nm), leading to the photoexcitation of ZnO and the generation of electron-hole pairs, thus producing ROS (Figure 14E). It was shown that antibacterial efficacy of the DFT-C/ZnO-hydrogel under dual-light irradiation against both E. coli and S. aureus was 99.9%, revealing that C/ZnO could endow the DFT-hydrogel with high photothermal and photodynamic performance upon the 808 and 660 nm irradiation (Figures 14F andG). In contrast, without light, there was no significant bacteria-killing effect compared to the control group. This was mainly stemmed from synergistic effects of the generated ROS, increased local heat as well as the release of Zn 2+ . Such effects caused the destruction of the bacteria cellular membrane, and thus disruption of bacterial metabolism and damage of intracellular proteins, consequently fulfilling a bacteria-killing property efficiently. 181 The quantitative wound closure rates in the in vivo wound healing for the DFT-C/ZnO-hydrogel, DFT-hydrogel, 3M wound dressing, and control groups were 59.8, 50.7, 48.2, and 35.8%, respectively. This evidence indicated the excellent performance of the DFT-C/ZnO-hydrogel as a wound dressing (Figure 14H). As shown in H&amp;E images, a large number of inflammatory cells (red arrows) could be found in the control and 3M wound dressing groups (Figure 14I). Compared to other groups, the DFT-C/ZnO-hydrogel group with dual light irradiation exhibited a few erythrocytes in the 2 day and 5 day groups and complete epidermal structure (indicated as yellow arrows). In addition, after 10 days, intact skin (indicated by a blue arrow) and normal subcutaneous tissue structure (indicated as green arrows) could be observed in the group. 181 Collectively, such excellent property of the all-in-one photoresponsive hydrogel shows a positive effect in the design and fabrication of advanced photodriven hydrogels in accelerated wound healing and tissue reconstruction.Polydopamine-Based Photothermal/Photodynamic Synergistic Therapy.

        <p>The effective and rapid antibacterial performance was realized by the combination of PDA and Ag@AgCl NPs as PTT and PDA, respectively, to generate mild conditions, i.e., lower temperature (50 °C) and limited ROS under single visible light irradiation through the PTDT. 173 Polyacrylamide as polymer was used to prepare PDA and Ag@AgCl-embedded hydrogels. Investigation on the bacterially infected wounds in vitro and in vivo showed that severe leakage of protein from the bacteria (i.e., S. aureus and E. coli), which was responsible for the antibacterial activity, occurred under the PTDT. It demonstrated that the interruption of the outer and inner membrane bacterial by heat and ROS could disrupt bacteria hemostasis. The phenomenon facilitated the entering of ROS into the bacteria, ultimately, leading to a bacteria-killing effect. This study highlighted how the understanding of the antibacterial mechanism, particularly through bacterial membrane permeation, and creating a balance between PDT and PTT for the design and fabrication of advanced photodriven antibacterial hydrogel dressings to treat infected wounds.The effective and rapid antibacterial performance was realized by the combination of PDA and Ag@AgCl NPs as PTT and PDA, respectively, to generate mild conditions, i.e., lower temperature (50 °C) and limited ROS under single visible light irradiation through the PTDT. 173 Polyacrylamide as polymer was used to prepare PDA and Ag@AgCl-embedded hydrogels.

        <p>MoS 2 -Based Photothermal/Photodynamic Synergistic Therapy. MoS 2 nanosheets, as one of the most representative and explored 2D transition metal dichalcogenides with an abundant precursor in nature, have gained a lot of interest in biomedicine applications. 182 The nanosheets are extensively used in PTT of cancer and infection. 20,[183][184][185][186] Ag 3 PO 4 as a potent photocatalyst could produce a large amount of ROS, thus killing bacteria during light irradiation. 177,187,188 Due to the promotion of the charge separation and the transfer of photongenerated electrons of Ag 3 PO 4 to MoS 2 , the combination of such nanostructures (i.e., Ag 3 PO 4 /MoS 2 ) could act as a stronger photocatalyst, thus endowing it with enhanced photochemical ROS generation capability for improving the antibacterial activity. In addition, the toxicity of the Ag + could be reduced by adsorption Ag + on the surface of MoS 2 nanosheets. In 2019, Ag 3 PO 4 /MoS 2 incorporated PVA hydrogel (named as Ag 3 PO 4 / MoS 2 HD) constructed for efficient wound healing based on the combination of PDT and PTT under dual light irradiation (660 and 808 nm) (Figure 15A). 31 In vitro studies showed that, compared to 660 nm visible light or 808 nm NIR light irradiation alone, the hydrogel exhibited more ROS production due to better electrical conductivity and heat generation under the dual light irradiation. 31 The behavior displayed in antibacterial property of the photoresponsive hydrogels against S. aureus bacteria, by SEM morphology of viable bacteria and colonyforming unit images (Figure 15B). As shown, the hydrogel exhibited excellent antibacterial efficiency within 5 min under coirradiation rather than single irradiation. Glutathione (GSH), an antioxidant, is oxidized into glutathione disulfide by ROS, therefore acting as a critical player in the bacterial defense system. 189,190 Consistent with the antibacterial results, the loss of GSH was much more under the dual light irradiation than 808 or 660 nm single light illumination (Figure 15C). Investigation on the infected mouse model showed that bacterial infection with ichor was observed in different groups after 2 days. However, under the illumination of the dual light, pus was reduced in the Ag 3 PO 4 /MoS 2 HD group compared with the other groups (Figure 15D). In vivo antibacterial activity studies showed a substantial reduction in the live bacteria in the Ag 3 PO 4 /MoS 2 group than the groups. In addition, compared with other groups, the outer skin layer treated with Ag 3 PO 4 / MoS 2 HD was more complete (Figure 15E). 31 A similar study was carried out by rGO/MoS 2 /Ag 3 PO 4embedded PVA hydrogel as antibacterial wound healing dressing in the treatment of infected wounds in vivo (Figure 16A). 191 It was shown that, compared with rGO and rGO/ MoS 2 -embedded hydrogels, higher temperature and more ROS were produced in rGO/MoS 2 /Ag 3 PO 4 -incorporated hydrogel under dual light illumination (808 + 660 nm). The enhanced PTDT was related to a collaborative behavior of the embedded PHTA and PHDA. Under the coirradiation, the photoinduced electrons will be transferred to the conduction band (CB) of Ag 3 PO 4 and MoS 2 . Subsequently, through the mediating of rGO, the electrons on CB of Ag 3 PO 4 will be transferred to the valence band (VB) of MoS 2 , thus consuming the holes collected on the VB of MoS 2 . As a result, • OH and 1 O 2 as ROS could be generated by holes on the VB of Ag 3 PO 4 , thereby decreasing electron fill on the CB of MoS 2 . Through this electron transformation, the photocatalytic activity of the hydrogels significantly improved and more heat was generated. 191 In another study, outstanding antibacterial activities were achieved using CuS@MoS 2 -incorporated PVA-based hydrogel, and 99.5% of S. aureus and 99.3% of E. coli were killed due to the PTDT under coillumination of 808 and 660 nm light (Figure 16B). 135 In fact, during the light irradiation, hyperthermia and ROS generated by the MoS 2 and CuS NPs, respectively, improved the bacterial membrane permeability. Therefore, it led to destroying bacterial membrane and proteins by the penetrated ROS and, thus, resulting in the accelerated eradicating of bacteria in vitro and in vivo. In addition, prompted wound healing related to the VEGF and hypoxia-inducible factor expression at the wound site.MoS 2 -Based Photothermal/Photodynamic Synergistic Therapy.

        <p>Graphene-Oxide-Based Photothermal/Photodynamic Synergistic Therapy. In 2019, a simultaneous PDT and PTT strategy was used by GO and ZnO-embedded CTS hydrogels (ZnO@GO-CT hydrogel) for accelerated wound healing applications (Figure 17A). 192 In the MPRHs, GO nanosheets acted as a photothermal agent that could increase the bacteriakilling efficiency of the hydrogels. 33,193 In addition, ZnO quantum dots (QDs) possessing a large number of conduction band electrons (e -) and/or valence band holes (h + ) enabled the MPRHs to produce ROS even in the absence of UV light to eliminate bacterial infection during the wound treatment. 194 They were dissolved under an acidic environment 195 to release Zn 2+ , thus boosting antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties of the hydrogels as well. As shown in Figure 17B, SEM images confirmed that ZnO@GO nanocomposite was uniformly loaded within the hydrogel. The photothermal performance of the hydrogels was power-dependent which power laser of 2.0 W/cm 2 was selected for further studies (Figure 17C). Decreasing of the water contact angle by increasing the concentration of ZnO@GO nanocomposite showed that the hydrogelʼs potential to maintain a moist environment around the wound area and detached from the wound hardly. The ability of ROS generation of the hydrogels, stemming from the ZnO NPs, was confirmed by decreasing the absorption intensity of 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) a ROS indicator. In vitro antibacterial activity of the ZnO@GO-CT hydrogels against S. aureus bacteria indicated that the photothermal effects under 808 nm light irradiation were better than those of the CTS and ZnO@GO nanocomposite alone (Figure 17D). The same results were observed with Gramnegative bacteria of E. coli. In vivo wound healing studies exhibited that the hybrid hydrogel could kill bacteria while accelerating wound healing without side effects to major organs of the treated mice. 192 Such behavior was related to the favorable antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects of the hydrogels upon single irradiation using 808 nm light.Graphene-Oxide-Based Photothermal/Photodynamic Synergistic Therapy.

        <p>Other Photothermal/Photodynamic Synergistic Therapy. Nowadays, the design and fabrication of multifunctional hydrogels with both disease-therapeutic and tissue regeneration capabilities referred to as regenerative hydrogels, which have a positive impact to treat diseases alongside tissue/organ regeneration. 196 Surgical excision is a general method for the treatment of cutaneous tumors, but complete eradicating of cancer cells and restoring of normal skin function after the surgeries remains a major challenge in the treatment of this type of tumor. 197 Therefore, the development of effective and innovative methods to simultaneously heal the wounds which are produced by surgical removal of large tumor tissues is highly imperative. 196,[198][199][200][201][202] To address this issue, Mg-containing black-titania-incorporated hydrogel, in which black titania NPs (B-TiO 2-x , ∼50 nm) were embedded within a CTS matrix, was developed for the healing of skin-tumor-induced wounds (Figure 18A). 55 Due to existence of B-TiO 2-x with abundant oxygen vacancies as PSs, simultaneous PDT and PTT under single laser irradiation (808 nm) was realized by the thermosensitive hydrogel. Moreover, the Mg 2+ ions released from the hydrogels could boost the proliferation, adhesion, and migration of skin cells, thus leading to accelerating wound closure significantly. 55 The real-time temperature changes of the hydrogels with different content of B-TiO 2-x NPs are shown in Figure 18B, which was concentration-dependent. As shown, negligible temperature elevation was observed in the thermogels without B-TiO 2-x NPs. In addition, ROS generation ( 1 O 2 ) of the thermogels under NIR irradiation at 808 nm was proved by DPBF degradation, demonstrating the potential of the lightdriven hydrogels in PDT (Figure 18C). Excellent in vitro and in vivo anticancer effect was observed by the BT-CTS thermogels because of simultaneous PTT/PDT effects. Interestingly, in vivo studies on skin tumor-induced wound healing showed that the skin wounds in tumor-bearing mice were gradually healed without significant tumor recurrence by photoactive thermogels as wound dressing, hence, confirming the theragenerative capacity of the hydrogels in vivo (Figure 18D). Using photoresponsive thermogels as a wound dressing to treat tumor-induced wounds, normal skin with regular capillaries along with newly formed tissue was observed in the H&amp;E images (Figure 18E). In contrast, irregular tumor vascularization under the incomplete epidermis was observable in other treated groups. The regenerative property was also related to the Mg 2+ ions released from hydrogels which had the potential to stimulate the proliferation, adhesion, and migration of normal skin cells to promote the wound healing process. 55 Therefore, the theragenerative property of thermogels has a positive impact in simultaneous cancer therapy and wound healing after the surgical resection of skin tumors.Other Photothermal/Photodynamic Synergistic Therapy.

        <p>As mentioned, it is indispensable to develop multifunctional hydrogels that can simultaneously act as a wound dressing, antibacterial and antitumor agent. It has been reported that CuS NPs not only could serve as PHTA but also for PDT due to the ROS generation under the NIR light illumination. 63,203 Therefore, CuS NP-loaded hydrogels can consider as a kind of promising theragenerative hydrogels with both diseasetherapeutic and tissue regeneration capabilities. In 2021, injectable CuS NP-loaded hydrogels were fabricated by incorporating CuS NPs within polyethylene glycol (PEG)functionalized with amino and thiol groups. In the presence of aldehyde-functionalized dextran polymer the hydrogels (named as G-CuS x , where x displayed the concentration of CuS NPs) formed via imine bond formation between the amino end groups of the PEG chain and the aldehyde functional groups of oxidized dextran. 204 The study showed that the G-CuS x hydrogel was self-healable, injectable, and biocompatible, as well as exhibited outstanding PDT and PDT performance on the eradication of cancer and bacteria both in vitro and in vivo (Figure 19A). As shown in Figure 19B, the photothermal behavior of the hydrogels depended on the CuS concentration.

        <p>Antibacterial activity of the hydrogels against S. aureus and E. coli was enhanced when the concentration of CuS NPs in the hydrogels increased and was further boosted under NIR irradiation. Such results proved more ROS generation under the condition, therefore causing the destruction of proteins and DNA of the bacteria and leading to more bactericidal properties. 204 In vivo antitumor studies of the hydrogels showed that the average weight of the excised tumors of the group treated with G-CuS1 and illuminated with NIR light (i.e., G-CuS1(+) in Figure 19D) was obviously reduced than the other groups, proving the promising antitumor effect of the photoresponsive hydrogel in vivo. Studies on the treatment of full-skininfected wounds on SD rats revealed that remaining wound areas of G-CuS0.5 groups under NIR irradiation were smaller in appearance than the other groups (Figure 19E). These results were also confirmed by H&amp;E staining images where quantitative statistical data showed that there were increased blood capillaries and collagen deposition in the G-CuS0.5-treated group (Figure 19F,G). These positive events in the wound healing process were related to the Cu 2+ released from the Cu NP-incorporated hydrogels that boosted the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells and fibroblast cells. 204Antibacterial activity of the hydrogels against S. aureus and E. coli was enhanced when the concentration of CuS NPs in the hydrogels increased and was further boosted under NIR irradiation.

These results were also confirmed by H&amp;E staining images where quantitative statistical data showed that there were increased blood capillaries and collagen deposition in the G-CuS0.5-treated group (Figure 19F,G). These positive events in the wound healing process were related to the Cu 2+ released from the Cu NP-incorporated hydrogels that boosted the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells and fibroblast cells. 204</p>

        <p>MPRHs represent a generation of advanced functional biomaterials for diverse applications, including wound healing. Such photoactive and multifunctional hydrogels can be prepared by the incorporation of PHTAs and PHDAs within the porous polymeric hydrogel networks. Each constituent of the MPRHs can alter one or more wound-healing phases, i.e., hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. In addition, the incorporation of PHTAs and PHDAs into hydrogel networks can improve the mechanical strength of the hydrogels via coordination bonds or other toughening interactions. The incorporation can also boost conductivity, photoresponsiveness, C/ZnO rapid assembly of DA and FA cross-linked by Zn 2+ followed by decoration of C/ZnO NPs small number of inflammatory cells in the wounds, complete epidermal structure as well as few erythrocytes in 2 and 5 days, intact skin plus normal subcutaneous tissue structure, and more collagen fibers in alignment similar to normal skin tissue 181 PDA/Ag@AgCl-PAM PDA Ag@AgCl cross-linking of PDA chains with the PAM via noncovalent interaction followed by embedding of Ag@AgCl nanostructures normal tissues after treatment for 12 days, almost no detectable sign of bacteria, and increased number of WBC, lymphocyte, and neutrophils at the midstage of the treatment attributing to promoted immune function by the release of Ag + and bioactivity of the final MPRHs, thus leading to the design and fabrication of ideal hybrid hydrogels to meet the prerequisites needed in wound healing.MPRHs represent a generation of advanced functional biomaterials for diverse applications, including wound healing.

        <p>In this review, we discussed the design, construction, and underlying healing performance of MPRHs for wound repair applications, with the main focus on their therapeutic and regenerative functionalities (Figure 20). We have also discussed how different compositions of MPRHs, type of light and PHTAs and PHDAs could control antibacterial activity and cellular behaviors, such as cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of the MPRHs. Meanwhile, we have provided state-of-art examples that can overcome the drawbacks of single therapy modes by combining PTT and PDT to achieve a complementary multi-therapeutic efficacy. In addition to providing many examples of the in vitro cellular studies, we also discussed how the optimized and engineered MPRHs could be exploited in animal models to acquire a satisfactory healing performance (Table 1).In this review, we discussed the design, construction, and underlying healing performance of MPRHs for wound repair applications, with the main focus on their therapeutic and regenerative functionalities (Figure 20).

        <p>Despite the recent achievements in this arena it should be emphasized that still many challenges and critical issues have remained to be addressed in the future by fundamental and transitional studies (Figure 20). These include (1) complete evaluation of toxicity of the MPRHs to surrounding tissues and other organs after the degradation of the hydrogel matrix, (2) development of the diverse forms of MPRHs for the easy and suitable route of administration, including patches and implants, for specific practical applications including the regenerative internal/external surgical closure, (3) deep understanding on the mechanism between phototherapy and injured vessels and immune responses, 205 (4) development of other antibacterial agents including the use of gas-releasing bactericidal molecules 206,207 not only against planktonic bacteria but also on the biofilms protecting resident bacteria from external attacks and increase their resistance to antibiotics, (5) development of combination of phototherapy with other modalities, including chemodynamic therapy, immunotherapy, and sonodynamic therapy to realize more efficient MPRHs, 208 (6) development of theragenerative hydrogels with both disease-therapeutic and tissue regeneration capabilities for simultaneous cancer therapy and wound healing after the surgical resection of skin tumors, 208,204 and (7) controlling the biodegradation of MPRHs, especially metal ion doping ones for further preclinical studies and clinical translation. This review will attract great attention from groups working on interdisciplinary research in tissue engineering science, chemistry, microbiology, and polymer science. In addition, more and more collaborations among fundamental, translational, and industrial entities are the indispensable part of moving MPRHs to the clinic. It is our hope that more collaborative efforts will be devoted to the development of advanced MPRHs to address all challenges discussed in this review and alleviate hurdles of treating difficult-to-treat wounds.Despite the recent achievements in this arena it should be emphasized that still many challenges and critical issues have remained to be addressed in the future by fundamental and transitional studies (Figure 20).
