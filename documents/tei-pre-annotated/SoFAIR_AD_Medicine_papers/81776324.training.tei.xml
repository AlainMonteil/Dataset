        <p>Background: This study aims to review the literature regarding the barriers to sampling, recruitment, participation, and retention of members of socioeconomically disadvantaged groups in health research and strategies for increasing the amount of health research conducted with socially disadvantaged groups. Methods: A systematic review with narrative synthesis was conducted. Searches of electronic databases Medline, PsychInfo, EMBASE, Social Science Index via Web of Knowledge and CINHAL were conducted for English language articles published up to May 2013. Qualitative and quantitative studies as well as literature reviews were included. Articles were included if they reported attempts to increase disadvantaged group participation in research, or the barriers to research with disadvantaged groups. Groups of interest were those described as socially, culturally or financially disadvantaged compared to the majority of society. Eligible articles were categorised according to five phases of research: 1) sampling, 2) recruitment and gaining consent, 3) data collection and measurement, 4) intervention delivery and uptake, and 5) retention and attrition. Results: In total, 116 papers from 115 studies met inclusion criteria and 31 previous literature reviews were included. A comprehensive summation of the major barriers to working with various disadvantaged groups is provided, along with proposed strategies for addressing each of the identified types of barriers. Most studies of strategies to address the barriers were of a descriptive nature and only nine studies reported the results of randomised trials.Background: This study aims to review the literature regarding the barriers to sampling, recruitment, participation, and retention of members of socioeconomically disadvantaged groups in health research and strategies for increasing the amount of health research conducted with socially disadvantaged groups.

        <p>Conclusions: To tackle the challenges of research with socially disadvantaged groups, and increase their representation in health and medical research, researchers and research institutions need to acknowledge extended timeframes, plan for higher resourcing costs and operate via community partnerships.Conclusions: To tackle the challenges of research with socially disadvantaged groups, and increase their representation in health and medical research, researchers and research institutions need to acknowledge extended timeframes, plan for higher resourcing costs and operate via community partnerships.</p>
        <p>The omission of groups of lower socioeconomic status from public health and medical research has been observed for some time regardless of type of research study [1]. In most Western developed countries white, middle class, highly educated males tend to be overrepresented in health and medical research and people from socially disadvantaged groups under-represented [1,2].The omission of groups of lower socioeconomic status from public health and medical research has been observed for some time regardless of type of research study [1].

        <p>Failure to obtain medical research data which accurately reflects the breadth of the whole population poses a number of drawbacks including threats to external validity and ability to generalise [3], denying excluded groups from any health benefits of trial participation [4], inability to check the safety of health innovations with sub-groups in the population [5], and failing to identify groups that have the highest burden of illness and developing an understanding of why differences exist [6].Failure to obtain medical research data which accurately reflects the breadth of the whole population poses a number of drawbacks including threats to external validity and ability to generalise [3], denying excluded groups from any health benefits of trial participation [4], inability to check the safety of health innovations with sub-groups in the population [5], and failing to identify groups that have the highest burden of illness and developing an understanding of why differences exist [6].</p>
        <p>Researchers continue to struggle to access, engage and retain participants from socially disadvantaged groups [7], resulting in labels such as "hard-to-reach" or "hidden". According to Sydor's [8] definition that "hard to reach populations are difficult for researchers to access", and Lambert and Wiebel's [9] definition of hidden populations as "those who are disadvantaged and disenfranchised: the homeless and transient, chronically mentally ill, high school drop-outs, criminal offenders, prostitutes, juvenile delinquents, gang members, runaways and other street people", socially disadvantaged groups are difficult for researchers to access cost-efficiently in large numbers necessary for statistically powerful study designs. There are many reasons why socially disadvantaged groups are not included in health and medical research. Understanding these factors is necessary for developing strategies to increase the level of involvement and participation in health and medical research for disadvantaged groups. This study aims to review the literature regarding the barriers to sampling, recruitment, participation, and retention of members of socially disadvantaged groups in health research and the strategies for overcoming the barriers that may help increase the amount of health research conducted with socially disadvantaged groups.Researchers continue to struggle to access, engage and retain participants from socially disadvantaged groups [7], resulting in labels such as "hard-to-reach" or "hidden".

        <p>Searches of electronic databases Medline, PsychInfo, EMBASE, Social Science Index via Web of Knowledge and CINHAL were conducted for English language articles published up to May 2013. A wide-net search strategy involving combinations of the following keywords was initially conducted to capture as broad a sample of studies as possible: "difficult to reach" or "hard to reach" or "social disadvantage" and "health research". An iterative process was used where more general searches were conducted initially, with papers identified informing subsequent targeted searches. A general internet search with 
            <rs type="software">Google Scholar</rs> also assisted in the search for grey literature. Free text searching was implemented using the following key words: 'hard-to-reach', 'difficult-to-reach', and 'disadvantaged' with 'health' and 'health research'. In addition, manual checks of the reference lists of retrieved articles and citation searches were conducted.

        <p>Articles were included if they reported attempts to increase socially disadvantaged group participation in research, or barriers to conducting research with socially disadvantaged groups. Socially disadvantaged groups were defined as socially, culturally or financially disadvantaged compared to the majority of society, implying individual, environmental or social restrictions to their opportunities to participate in health research [8][9][10]. In order to capture a broad representation of evidence, qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods, case studies and literature reviews were included. Only studies that focused on health-related research were included.Articles were included if they reported attempts to increase socially disadvantaged group participation in research, or barriers to conducting research with socially disadvantaged groups.

        <p>Sampling through community organisations One option for creating a sampling frame for specific socially disadvantaged groups is to collaborate with community organisations with access to those groups and to draw a convenience sample through that organisation [44,47,54,[60][61][62]67,74,103,116,118,122,128,136]. Benoit et al. [122] variously defined community group as any group with high access to the target population and partnerships have taken three main forms: a) the community group helping researchers gain access to an otherwise hard-to-reach group; b) a reciprocal relationship in which community members and researchers have knowledge and learn from the other; and c) community-initiated research projects that seek academic partnerships and use the outcomes to direct policy and program delivery.

        <p>Reasons provided for low response rates in research with socially disadvantaged groups included: mistrust in research or researchers, particularly amongst African Americans and Indigenous populations who had a history of being mistreated in medical research; fear of authority; and perceptions that participation presented no personal benefit to them or their community and may cause potential harm, stigma, mistreatment or exploitation. Similarly members of some groups may fail to participate in research out of fear of being publically exposed, particularly if they engaged in illegal behaviours such as prostitution, gambling or illicit drug use or are socially stigmatised, such as people with HIV or AIDS or people who are GLBT.

This may be particularly effective for communities that have hierarchical structures such as Australian Aboriginal communities who look to their elders to provide leadership. Some reports have suggested that engagement of local peer or known community members as 'recruiters' will increase trust and response rates [21,40,55,82,96,105,121,123,124]. Similarly, the use of community advisory groups is likely to be beneficial and increase the perception that the research is community-driven and responsive [28,47,100,113,118,135]. Germino et al.

        <p>Strategies to encourage gatekeeper support Strategies for addressing the barrier of gatekeepers include employing gatekeepers as project recruitment officers and involving them in the research [22,93,100,113,118]; ensuring that community authorities are informed about the research and adequately consulted [113,114]; and paying health professionals through financial incentives to assist with recruitment [125,143]. Loftin et al. [71] reported slow recruitment and low response rates in a study using primary health care provider identification and recruitment of African Americans into diabetes research. One review suggested developing patient materials that can be distributed directly to potential participants of clinical trials thus overcoming the barriers of clinicians being too busy to recruit or having poor communication skills [143]. Mathy et al. [51] compared an internet derived sample with a Gallup poll sample of the US general population. They found the samples equivalent in educational distribution and geographical location (rural and urban), and the internet sample reached more representatives of lower income and ethnic diversity.Strategies to encourage gatekeeper support Strategies for addressing the barrier of gatekeepers include employing gatekeepers as project recruitment officers and involving them in the research [22,93,100,113,118]; ensuring that community authorities are informed about the research and adequately consulted [113,114]; and paying health professionals through financial incentives to assist with recruitment [125,143].

        <p>Comparison studies Four of the nine RCTs examined the effectiveness of recruitment strategies [36,42,43,106], as did three non-RCT comparison studies [41,75,83]. In a RCT by Satia et al. [43], potential African American participants were randomly assigned to receive either generic or culturally sensitive invitation letters. Within each letter group participants were randomly assigned to receive a small incentive (a telephone card worth USD $3.60). While the overall response rate was low (17.5%), it was significantly higher for those receiving the incentive (23.9%) compared with those not receiving an incentive (15.8%). There was no difference in response rates between those receiving the generic invitation letter and the 'culturally sensitive' letter [43]. Maxwell et al. [42] trialled three incentive conditions (no incentive, USD $5 cash or $20 promise upon completion) to increase response rates to a baseline survey amongst racially diverse groups (Latino, Asian and African American). No differences were found and response rates were low (28%-37%). Another RCT assessed whether an advance letter mailed out two weeks prior to a mailed survey would enhance response rates among African American participants compared with White American participants [36]. Statistically significant differences were found for white American participants only illustrating how a strategy can potentially contribute to disparities. In a RCT of hand-written envelopes compared with printed envelopes to increase survey response rates in a socioeconomically disadvantaged area, Choudhury et al. [106] found that the hand-written envelopes resulted in slightly but not significantly higher response rate (17% vs. 14%). Using 'debriefing questionnaires' to glean interviewer experiences of recruiting subjects using three different methods, McLean &amp; Campbell [109] found that local advertisements and use of media recruited the highest number of white English participants, interpersonal contacts increased recruitment of Pakistani-Kashmiri subjects and organisational contacts recruited the most African-Caribbean subjects. All approaches included financial incentives for participation. Oakley et al. [112] compared the cost of using interpreters to increase recruitment of non-English speaking women. Costs per person recruited were higher for women who needed an interpreter (average of £135) compared with for those who did not (£80).Comparison studies Four of the nine RCTs examined the effectiveness of recruitment strategies [36,42,43,106], as did three non-RCT comparison studies [41,75,83].

[42] trialled three incentive conditions (no incentive, USD $5 cash or $20 promise upon completion) to increase response rates to a baseline survey amongst racially diverse groups (Latino, Asian and African American). No differences were found and response rates were low (28%-37%). Another RCT assessed whether an advance letter mailed out two weeks prior to a mailed survey would enhance response rates among African American participants compared with White American participants [36]. Statistically significant differences were found for white American participants only illustrating how a strategy can potentially contribute to disparities. In a RCT of hand-written envelopes compared with printed envelopes to increase survey response rates in a socioeconomically disadvantaged area, Choudhury et al. [106] found that the hand-written envelopes resulted in slightly but not significantly higher response rate (17% vs. 14%). Using 'debriefing questionnaires' to glean interviewer experiences of recruiting subjects using three different methods, McLean &amp; Campbell [109] found that local advertisements and use of media recruited the highest number of white English participants, interpersonal contacts increased recruitment of Pakistani-Kashmiri subjects and organisational contacts recruited the most African-Caribbean subjects. All approaches included financial incentives for participation. Oakley et al. [112] compared the cost of using interpreters to increase recruitment of non-English speaking women. Costs per person recruited were higher for women who needed an interpreter (average of £135) compared with for those who did not (£80).</p>
        <p>One unique study [25] sought to develop an African American 'health research registry' for easier future recruitment and engagement with research. The study compared direct recruitment methods (using existing study sample databases; public databases; community outreach) with indirect methods (radio, internet and email). The study concluded that all strategies were needed to recruit a representative sample into the registry because some strategies were more successful with sub-groups (e.g., email and internet methods recruited younger participants).One unique study [25] sought to develop an African American 'health research registry' for easier future recruitment and engagement with research.

        <p>The need for complete and representative data from health research studies is common across study types but is particularly important in surveys. Language, lack of education and low literacy barriers may prohibit the collection of certain types of data such as selfadministered survey data. Similarly, a barrier which is specific to telephone-based data collection is the lack of landline telephones amongst disadvantaged groups, limiting their inclusion in epidemiological and populationbased research. Shebl et al. [49], for example found significant differences between those with or without landline telephones in race/ethnicity, health care access, insurance coverage and several types of health behaviours including smoking status and cancer screening behaviours. The resulting bias suggests that population-wide surveys utilising only landline telephone surveying techniques are not providing accurate estimates of health behaviours. Finally suspicion regarding the use of the data collected and mistrust of researchers were identified as barriers.The need for complete and representative data from health research studies is common across study types but is particularly important in surveys.

        <p>Inclusive language and methods One of the most common strategies to improve inclusion of linguistically diverse or low literacy groups in health research is to simplify the reading age of the study materials or to translate materials into other more common languages [45,63,96,113] and use bilingual research assistants [45,85,90,100,111]. A number of studies highlighted the need for culturally trained and skilled field-workers [56,111,140] or employing locals or peers to conduct field work [55,74,96,98,105,115,118]. Use of "insiders" (peer or local researchers) offers the added advantage of addressing any researcher mistrust or suspicion [105] as well as building the capacity of the community or organisation in conducting research. One method of data collection called Photovoice allows participants to use photos and pictures to respond to spoken questions or scenarios and to tell a 'story' [133]. Photovoice has been used with Australian Aboriginal communities where the telling of stories is often through paintings and art. Its use is limited as an exploratory qualitative tool and does not provide large-scale quantitative data.Inclusive language and methods One of the most common strategies to improve inclusion of linguistically diverse or low literacy groups in health research is to simplify the reading age of the study materials or to translate materials into other more common languages [45,63,96,113] and use bilingual research assistants [45,85,90,100,111].

        <p>In order to address barriers to socially disadvantaged groups participating in telephone surveys, a number of studies have outlined the need for flexibility and tailoring of data collection methods to participant circumstances [60,113,114]. If participants cannot be reached by telephone data collection, telephone surveys could be supplemented by face-to-face door knock interviews [49] or online surveys [52]. Allison et al. [110] caution that supplementing postal questionnaires with face to face interviews may not produce responses with equivalence as comparisons of these two modes of survey delivery resulted in very low kappa agreement scores for some items. Working with Australian Aboriginal communities Couzos et al. [114] proposed a 'community-controlled' research process including data collection and management which was flexible and involved locals employed to administer the research protocol.In order to address barriers to socially disadvantaged groups participating in telephone surveys, a number of studies have outlined the need for flexibility and tailoring of data collection methods to participant circumstances [60,113,114].

        <p>Thomas et al.

These authors give the example of tobacco and alcohol sales data from Australian Aboriginal communities. This measure is only a proxy to behavioural measures and provides limited data about how the tobacco or alcohol might have been used and by whom. However, in some cases the objective data could be supplemented with smaller targeted qualitative research using methods such as Photovoice ( [133]: see above) to gain a more complete set of information about a health concern or health behaviour.

        <p>Comparison studies Two RCTs of intervention strategies tailored for disadvantaged groups were included in the review. In a blinded randomised trial, Nicholson et al. [37] compared emotional and behavioural responses to four versions of an information intervention provided to Africa-American communities regarding colorectal cancer screening (1. Emphasising impact on African-Americans, 2. "Blacks are doing worse than whites", 3. "Blacks are improving but less than whites", and 4. Progress -"Blacks are improving over time"). Participants exposed to the two versions highlighting disparities framed in a negative way (2 and 3 above), reported more negative emotional reactions. In contrast the progress framing (4 above), elicited more positive responses and potential participants were more likely to agree to be screened. The results of this trial suggest that the way in which health information is presented can influence attitudes and intentions, with reports about progress yielding a more positive effect on intention. The authors note that this is especially important among those with high levels of medical mistrust. Befort et al.

        <p>Twenty six studies [16][17][18]20,[22][23][24]30,35,39,40,54,65,66,[70][71][72][73][74][75][76]80,81,85,96,123] and six reviews [135,139,145,147,148,158] examined barriers to retaining participants in research and strategies for maximising retention rates. The most common barrier reported related to follow-up data collection was difficulty maintaining participant contact. Challenges to maintaining contact included the transient nature of the lives of those in many socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, with phone numbers and addresses changing frequently. Practical barriers often related to their socially disadvantaged status such as transport difficulties, inability to take time away from work to participate, lack of child-care or simply forgetting about the research which is competing with other priorities of daily living [73].Twenty six studies [16][17][18]20,[22][23][24]30,35,39,40,54,65,66,[70][71][72][73][74][75][76]80,81,85,96,123] and six reviews [135,139,145,147,148,158] examined barriers to retaining participants in research and strategies for maximising retention rates.

        <p>Incentives and gifts The most commonly trialled strategy for maintaining involvement of participants throughout a research project was the use of incentives and gifts [18,[22][23][24]30,39,40,[71][72][73]76,80,81,123,158]. Cash incentives have been found to be more effective than non-cash incentives [23], however the use of study branding or logos on non-cash gifts has been reported to be effective in case studies at keeping participants involved [74]. In a study with young Latino women, Lindenberg et al. [80] found that financial cash incentives were considered unacceptable and that vouchers for grocery or department stores were preferred.Incentives and gifts The most commonly trialled strategy for maintaining involvement of participants throughout a research project was the use of incentives and gifts [18,[22][23][24]30,39,40,[71][72][73]76,80,81,123,158].

        <p>Multiple tracking, reminders and contact procedures Keeping in regular contact with participants has been reported as an effective method of lowering attrition. Ensuring that researchers have multiple forms of contact for each participant (e.g., phone, mail, email, address and other contact persons), has been reported to be essential for maintaining contact with participants from vulnerable groups who may be highly mobile [17,20,22,30,39,40,54,75,81,85] as well as having contact details of significant others [20,66,76]. Using a 'participant-centred approach' during these multiple contacts, such as personalised telephone calls rather than generic reminder letters enhances retention [18,20,73,123]. In a small pilot study with 48 methamphetamine injectors, Maher et al. [65] found mobile phone text messaging was a successful method of reaching participants (73% contacted) throughout the study. Participants reported that the text messaging was acceptable and there were no differences in the demographics between those who were retained and those who dropped out. Meyers et al. [66] provide a detailed analysis of the tracking strategies they used to obtain extremely high retention rates with substanceabusing youth. The authors described enhanced tracking efforts such as obtaining various contact details during their substance abuse treatment and post treatment, use of a locator form which recorded the contact details of family members, agencies they use and community locations they frequent. Small participant incentives were offered for follow-up (USD5) and approximately 40% of participants required six or more contacts in order to achieve follow-up interview completion. Most (60%) follow-up interviews were conducted in community settings preferred by participants such as fast food outlets. The strategies achieved 94% retention at one month follow-up and 92% retention at six month follow-up. The authors estimated that the additional tracking and retention strategies cost approximately USD85 per participant per follow-up wave.Multiple tracking, reminders and contact procedures Keeping in regular contact with participants has been reported as an effective method of lowering attrition.

        <p>Building relationships and trust Flexibility in scheduling follow-up appointments, responding to messages positively, providing a caring environment, being courteous and frequent contact were all strategies designed to build relationships with participants and reduce attrition [16,30,35,66,[70][71][72]74,76,158]. Flexibility in scheduling appointments addresses practical barriers as well such as difficulties with child care or time from work. Brown et al. [72] reported that participants were more likely to remain in clinical trial research if their doctor helped them feel comfortable. Similarly McMillan et al. [96] credit high retention rates (78% at 6 weeks) of low-income pregnant women on the participants' midwives involvement.Building relationships and trust Flexibility in scheduling follow-up appointments, responding to messages positively, providing a caring environment, being courteous and frequent contact were all strategies designed to build relationships with participants and reduce attrition [16,30,35,66,[70][71][72]74,76,158].

        <p>This is the first literature review to consider all of the research process where representativeness of socially disadvantaged groups may be compromised; sampling, recruitment, data collection, intervention delivery and retention. While previous reviews exist, most are now dated and focussed on one point in the research process, mainly the recruitment or retention of socially disadvantaged groups, and do not consider issues of engagement such as compliance with measurement and intervention. Previous reviews are also limited in scope focusing either on one target group of interest, one type of research study design or one type of intervention. The current review is greater in scope and comprehensiveness providing the reader with a complete picture of strategies for improving socially disadvantaged group participation in research for any given group, within any given research study type and using any given type of intervention strategy. Based on the outcomes of the 116 primary studies included in the current review and 31 literature reviews, a considerable number of barriers to the inclusion of socially disadvantaged groups in health and medical research were identified.This is the first literature review to consider all of the research process where representativeness of socially disadvantaged groups may be compromised; sampling, recruitment, data collection, intervention delivery and retention.

        <p>Synthesising the literature was made complex by the amount of methodological variation between included studies and the decision to combine a review of both barriers and strategies. Differences in study design and procedures, the nature of the health issue under investigation, settings and the target population groups limited comparisons across studies. A crude 'levels of evidence' hierarchy was used (as shown in Table 1), and it must be acknowledged that the usefulness of this approach in examining the research quality is limited. For example, while the RCT presents high level evidence of strategy effectiveness and qualitative research is considered low level evidence of strategy effectiveness, qualitative research, if conducted well, is appropriate research design for gaining an understanding of the barriers to research participation. However, when considering the studies included in the review which examined intervention effectiveness there were too few RCTs to pool data. As a result, this review does not provide conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of the discussed strategies. Some papers report case-studies or other descriptions of research which were not hypothesis-driven testing of strategies and not high level evidence of effectiveness. We included these studies as it is not possible to conduct RCTs of some multi-factorial strategies. Instead, these case studies provide valuable insights for researchers endeavouring to include socially disadvantaged groups, so long as the limitation in the quality of evidence is acknowledged. The strength of evidence for many of the strategies reported in this review is largely unknown and further robust experimental trials of those strategies which can be tested are required.Synthesising the literature was made complex by the amount of methodological variation between included studies and the decision to combine a review of both barriers and strategies.

        <p>It is imperative that all types of health and medical research employ strategies to increase the representation of socially disadvantaged groups. Strategies will need to be designed and tailored according to different study types and research questions. In some cases, it is more appropriate to target the disadvantaged group of interest in the research. In other examples, like clinical trials of new medicines, it is important that various groups are represented in the overall study sample. It is clear from this review that the barriers to research with socially disadvantaged group are numerous and no one single solution to addressing the barriers exists. To address multiple barriers and challenges, a comprehensive, coordinated, multipronged approach involving many strategies across all stages of research needs to be adopted. This has significant time, cost and data ownership implications. Firstly, a long-term view to conducting research with socially disadvantaged groups is necessary. Developing relationships with communities and community groups, including their involvement in the development of procedures and study resources, and extensive formative research and pilot testing, require a considerable amount of time. Providing collaborating communities and groups with adequate feedback following the conclusion of the study, and in some cases, interventions or treatments, further extends project timelines. These activities ought to be reflected in project timelines and acknowledged by academic institutions employing researchers who conduct studies with socially disadvantaged groups. This long-term view should also be extended to publication of research with socially disadvantaged groups.It is imperative that all types of health and medical research employ strategies to increase the representation of socially disadvantaged groups.

        <p>Secondly, many of the strategies are resource intensive and entail costs which may be additional to the usual costs of managing a research project. The addition of translation services or bilingual research staff, flexibility regarding data collection locations or times, gifts and incentives, culturally tailored resources and materials, extensive participant tracking procedures and additional staff training require consideration of costs. Some strategies such as including all family members in a study to avoid random selection [113], or offering those randomised to control conditions other types of interventions or treatments [148], may increase study costs significantly. These costs can be justified in funding applications and need to be recognised by funding organisations. Finally, in some cases of community collaborative research, data ownership may need to be negotiated and joint authorship with non-academic collaborators included. Academic researchers need to be supported by their academic institutions and scientific journals for publishing collaborative research which may take longer to produce due to authorship negotiations.Secondly, many of the strategies are resource intensive and entail costs which may be additional to the usual costs of managing a research project.

        <p>The establishment of research centres or research collaborations dedicated to high quality health and medical research with socially disadvantaged groups is one model for addressing many of the issues raised in this review in a coordinated manner [160,161]. Numerous benefits would flow-on from these research centres including pooling of funding and resourcing, drawing on multidisciplinary expertise, promoting a high-level research culture in the field, expansion in the development of partnership links and networks with community organisations and groups which would increase access and recruitment, and training and building the capacity of future leaders in health research with socially disadvantaged groups.The establishment of research centres or research collaborations dedicated to high quality health and medical research with socially disadvantaged groups is one model for addressing many of the issues raised in this review in a coordinated manner [160,161].

        <p>This review found a number of strategies and methodologies that may have a negative impact on health inequities. For example, the use of incentives, which have considerable evidence for improving recruitment and retention in the general literature [162], have negative connotations in some cultures [80]. Also, some commentators have raised ethical concerns regarding the use of incentives with research participants who may be financially compromised [163]. Festinger et al. [23,24] however, provided compelling evidence in their trials of cash incentives with people in substance abuse treatment; participants in these trials did not use the cash incentive to purchase illicit substances and did not perceive the incentives as coercive highlighting the need to test strategies with target groups for both positive and negative effects. Similarly, the way language is used and information framed [37] can have a negative impact on the reactions of some groups to health research. It is difficult to generalise results from one disadvantaged group to another as different cultural factors may be influencing reactions and outcomes.This review found a number of strategies and methodologies that may have a negative impact on health inequities.

[23,24] however, provided compelling evidence in their trials of cash incentives with people in substance abuse treatment; participants in these trials did not use the cash incentive to purchase illicit substances and did not perceive the incentives as coercive highlighting the need to test strategies with target groups for both positive and negative effects. Similarly, the way language is used and information framed [37] can have a negative impact on the reactions of some groups to health research. It is difficult to generalise results from one disadvantaged group to another as different cultural factors may be influencing reactions and outcomes.</p>
        <p>Knowledge gained from health research, particularly health services research, is used to inform the development or improvement of health policy and health care. If a diversity of the population of health service users is not included, service delivery is likely to be inequitable. Doherty et al. [164] have identified three main hard-to-reach groups within service involvement: 1) the under-represented; 2) the invisible/overlooked; and 3) the service resistant. Reports suggest that the same types of barriers that result in underrepresentation in health research also lead to under-representation in health service usedistrust of authorities, health literacy and communication difficulties and pragmatic financial, transport or employment related barriers [165]. An improvement in the representation of vulnerable groups in health research, particularly health services research, is likely to yield benefits through more equitable service delivery and engagement.Knowledge gained from health research, particularly health services research, is used to inform the development or improvement of health policy and health care.

        <p>Tudor-Hart first showed that the individual requiring the greatest effort to attend a health service is also the one with the greatest need [166]. While involving socially disadvantaged groups in activities may be resourceintensive and challenging, it has been argued that where sufficient funds allow the development of more creative approaches, it should be possible to engage with all members of society [167]. The strategies described in this review as potentially effective at increasing involvement in health research, may be generalizable to improving access and use of health services.Tudor-Hart first showed that the individual requiring the greatest effort to attend a health service is also the one with the greatest need [166].

        <p>The main limitation of the study is the extent of methodological variation in the studies included in the review. The extent of heterogeneity between studies prohibited combining the results statistically in a metaanalysis. The inclusion of low level evidence also prohibits conclusive comments regarding the effectiveness of many of the strategies discussed in this review. However, this could also be considered a study strength as well; few RCTs were identified to provide a complete assessment of the effectiveness of strategies and inclusion of descriptive studies and case-studies provides valuable insights into ways to increase research with socially disadvantaged groups worth further testing. Finally, the majority of studies included in the review were conducted in developed countries and may not be generalizable to other countries.The main limitation of the study is the extent of methodological variation in the studies included in the review.

        <p>Representativeness can be threatened at various stages of the research process, and researchers must remain mindful of whom they may be excluding in the design and implementation of research studies, and employ strategies to avoid this happening.Representativeness can be threatened at various stages of the research process, and researchers must remain mindful of whom they may be excluding in the design and implementation of research studies, and employ strategies to avoid this happening.</p>
        <p>Researchers are in a powerful position to influence inequities in health outcomes. Generation of research findings that are representative of all social groups will allow development of an evidence base that can be used by service providers and policy makers to deliver programs and policies that reduce health inequities. Research funding agencies also play a role in ensuring that they fund research that demonstrates consideration of representativeness in its design, budget and timelines given this type of research is likely to be more complex, costly and time-consuming. However as the World Health Organisation's Commission on the Social Determinants of Health notes the increased investment is highly worthwhile as addressing health inequities will result in health, social and economic benefits for all of society [10].Researchers are in a powerful position to influence inequities in health outcomes.
