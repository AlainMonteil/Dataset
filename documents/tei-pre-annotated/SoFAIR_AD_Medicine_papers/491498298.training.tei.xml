        <p>Background: Transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) is the treatment of choice for intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Doxorubicin-loaded drug-eluting beads (DEB)-TACE is expected to improve the performance of conventional TACE (cTACE). The aim of this study was to compare DEB-TACE with cTACE in terms of time-to-tumour progression (TTP), adverse events (AEs), and 2-year survival.Background: Transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) is the treatment of choice for intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

        <p>Results: We enrolled 177 patients: 89 underwent DEB-TACE and 88 cTACE. The median number of procedures was 2 in each arm, and the in-hospital stay was 3 and 4 days, respectively (P ¼ 0.323). No differences were found in local and overall tumour response. The median TTP was 9 months in both arms. The AE incidence and severity did not differ between the arms, except for postprocedural pain, more frequent and severe after cTACE (Po0.001). The 1-and 2-year survival rates were 86.2% and 56.8% after DEB-TACE and 83.5% and 55.4% after cTACE (P ¼ 0.949). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), serum albumin, and tumour number independently predicted survival (Po0.05).Results: We enrolled 177 patients: 89 underwent DEB-TACE and 88 cTACE.

        <p>According to Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) tumour staging and management (Bruix and Llovet, 2002), endorsed by the American (AASLD) and European (EASL-EORTC) guidelines for HCC management (Bruix and Sherman, 2005;Llovet et al, 2012), transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) is recommended as first-line therapy for unresectable intermediate-stage HCC (stage B). This evidence-based position reflects the results of three studies showing that TACE significantly improves patient survival as compared with best supportive care (Llovet et al, 2002;Lo et al, 2002;Llovet and Bruix, 2003). Despite the widespread use of screening programmes, 60-70% of HCCs are detected when curative treatments (surgery or ablation) are precluded by the cancer burden or contraindications (Bruix and Llovet, 2002;Takayasu et al, 2012). In fact, TACE is the most common treatment modality used in HCC patients, and almost half of TACEs are carried out for early tumours unsuitable for curative treatment (Varela et al, 2010).According to Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) tumour staging and management (Bruix and Llovet, 2002), endorsed by the American (AASLD) and European (EASL-EORTC) guidelines for HCC management (Bruix and Sherman, 2005;Llovet et al, 2012), transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) is recommended as first-line therapy for unresectable intermediate-stage HCC (stage B).

        <p>Transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation with calibrated doxorubicin-carrying microspheres, DC-Beads (DEB-TACE), have been introduced as a novel device capable of ensuring more sustained and tumour-selective drug delivery and permanent embolisation (Varela et al, 2007), which could satisfy the requirement for standardising treatment regimens. A multicentre international randomised trial (Lammer et al, 2010) comparing the short-term outcomes of DEB-TACE and conventional TACE (cTACE) in terms of toxicity and radiologic tumour response indicated some advantages of the first technique, particularly in 'fragile' subgroups, such as Child-Pugh B and performance status (PS) 40 patients, and in those with bilobar or recurrent tumours. Despite these appealing premises, the superiority of DEB-TACE over cTACE in terms of patient survival has yet to be demonstrated. Two retrospective studies (Dhanasekaran et al, 2010;Song et al, 2012), affected by several biases, have suggested the superiority of DEB-TACE whereas a small randomised controlled trial has not confirmed this superiority (Sacco et al, 2011).Transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation with calibrated doxorubicin-carrying microspheres, DC-Beads (DEB-TACE), have been introduced as a novel device capable of ensuring more sustained and tumour-selective drug delivery and permanent embolisation (Varela et al, 2007), which could satisfy the requirement for standardising treatment regimens.

Patients 418 years of age, with HCC unsuitable for curative treatment or had failed/recurred after resection/ablation and diagnosed by biopsy or according to the AASLD criteria (Bruix and Sherman, 2005), were eligible for the study. Causes of non-qualification for curative treatments were contraindications to liver transplant; poor liver function (Child-Pugh class B or MELD score 410), severe comorbidities and patient refusal for resection; critical location or non-visibility at ultrasonography of nodules and not permissive clotting/platelet count for ablation. The inclusion criteria were patients belonging to class Child-Pugh A or B (score 7) and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS p1, no previous treatment on target lesions (prior treatments on non-target lesions were accepted). The exclusion criteria were infiltrative HCC, portal vein thrombosis, ascites, F3 oesophageal varices, advanced liver disease (bilirubin levels X2.5 mg dl À 1 , albumin p30 g l À 1 , platelets p50 Â 10 9 per litre, INR 41.5), other tumours in the previous 5 years, and contraindications to arteriography or TACE. Previous locoregional treatment (including resection) of non-target lesions did not preclude enrolment.Study population.

        <p>Study aims and hypothesis. The primary aim of the study was to compare 2-year survival between the two study arms. The secondary end points were radiological tumour response, timeto-tumour progression (TTP: interval between randomisation and radiological tumour progression), impact on PS and liver function, number of treatments, duration of in-hospital stay and need for other types of treatment of residual/recurrent tumours. For obvious ethical reasons and since our investigation aimed at achieving results similar to those achievable with the HCC therapies usually adopted in our country (pragmatic trial), the study design allowed referral physicians to treat tumour persistence/progression after at least two TACEs with alternative treatments (ablation, surgery or sorafenib administration). According to the rules of the Italian Drug Regulatory Agency (AIFA), sorafenib was dispensed to patients who were in Child-Pugh class A at the time of tumour progression.Study aims and hypothesis.

        <p>Two formal interim analyses, planned after B50% and 75% of enrolment, were conducted by an external statistician to assess survival at 24 months post treatment. The first interim analysis, involving 116 patients (57 cTACE and 59 DEB-TACE cases; 54% of the planned sample size), showed no difference between the two arms (Mantel-Haenszel, P ¼ 0.853). Similarly, the second interim analysis, involving 177 patients (88 cTACE and 89 DEB-TACE), showed no difference between arms (Mantel-Haenszel, P ¼ 0.949). A reviewer committee, formed by two experts external to the study, and an external statistician, was thus consulted on the utility of continuing enrolment. Since it was highly unlikely that extended enrolment would reveal the superiority of DEB-TACE, the committee recommended stopping the trial for futility (Pocock, 1992). The results presented here are therefore derived from a population of 177 patients, representing 83% of the original planned sample size (Figure 1).Two formal interim analyses, planned after B50% and 75% of enrolment, were conducted by an external statistician to assess survival at 24 months post treatment.

        <p>Tumour response. At 30 days, radiological evaluation of the tumour response was available in all but one patient who had died after the first cTACE from septic shock. A local CR (of the target lesions) was observed in 101 patients (57.1%), overall CR in 91 (51.4%), PR in 66 (37.3%), SD in 6 (3.4%), and progressive disease (PD) in 13 (7.3%). Thus, OR was obtained in 157 patients (88.7%) and DC in 163 (92.1%). No significant differences were found in the rates of local (CR, OR, and DC) (Figure 2) and overall tumour responses during the follow-up period (P40.05 in all cases), except for a more frequent overall CR at 1 month after cTACE than after DEB-TACE (59.8% vs 43.8%; P ¼ 0.036) (Figure 3). Conversely, a trend towards a higher rate of local CR after DEB-TACE was observed at 6 months (68.7% vs 63.5%). This trend, however, conflicted with a tendency to a higher rate of overall CR after cTACE at the same time point (58.1% vs 52.2%), due to the lower occurrence of new nodules in cTACE (5 out of 20, 25%) than in DEB-TACE patients (9 out of 23, 39%) at the time of progression, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (P ¼ 0.353).Tumour response.

        <p>Transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation is considered as the standard treatment for patients with HCC in the BCLC intermediate stage (Bruix and Llovet, 2002;Llovet et al, 2012) but it is also used in early-stage HCC patients excluded from potentially curative treatment. In fact, as in other studies (Varela et al, 2010;Burrel et al, 2012;Takayasu et al, 2012), early HCC patients represented a notable proportion of our cases. Conventional TACE suffers from several technical problems, such as lack of standardisation of the procedure and escape of the chemotherapeutic agent from the treated portion of liver. These limitations are theoretically reduced by DEB-TACE.

        <p>Our study did not demonstrate any difference in local and overall response and DC between cTACE and DEB-TACE, except at 1 month when cTACE achieved a higher rate of overall CR. As this superiority disappeared thereafter, when lipiodol staining decreased, it probably represents a spurious benefit due to the 'masking effect' of lipiodol at the first post-TACE evaluation with MDCT. This potential inaccuracy in the initial tumour response was accepted at the time we designed the study for two reasons; first, in clinical practice MDCT is more easily available than MR, and is one of tools recommended to control TACE results (Bruix and Sherman, 2005); second, the primary objective of the study was to compare the survival of patient undergoing the two procedures.Our study did not demonstrate any difference in local and overall response and DC between cTACE and DEB-TACE, except at 1 month when cTACE achieved a higher rate of overall CR.

        <p>The 3-month OR rate (about 74%), seen in both treatment arms, is in line with what was reported in our previous study (Golfieri et al, 2013) using cTACE, and by Song et al (2012) with DEB-TACE. In the Korean series, the OR achieved with cTACE was much lower (49.4%) than ours, possibly due to a defectively standardised procedure. These authors also reported a better response with DEB-TACE in intermediate-stage but not in earlystage tumours, suggesting that this technique could facilitate treatment of larger lesions. Such a stage-dependent difference in the efficacy between the two types of TACE was not confirmed by our study, which did not detect any differences in the CR rates between treatment arms according to BCLC stage, lobar/bilobar tumoural extension or Child-Pugh class.The 3-month OR rate (about 74%), seen in both treatment arms, is in line with what was reported in our previous study (Golfieri et al, 2013) using cTACE, and by Song et al (2012) with DEB-TACE.

        <p>Our results also conflict with the first multicentric randomised European trial (Lammer et 6 months with DEB-TACE in more compromised patients (Child-Pugh B, ECOG-1, bilobar, or recurrent disease). However, in this trial the SAE incidence was B20% in both cTACE and DEB-TACE patients, leading to treatment discontinuation in 13% of cases. This trial also reported significantly reduced side effects after DEB-TACE. These figures are much higher than ours (6.2%), regardless of the type of TACE we employed. Such different findings could be related both to the TACE reiteration at 2-month intervals regardless of tumour response (82% of patients received a second TACE and B60% a third TACE), and to the high amount of Doxorubicin (up to 150 mg per course) utilised in the European study.Our results also conflict with the first multicentric randomised European trial (Lammer et 6 months with DEB-TACE in more compromised patients (Child-Pugh B, ECOG-1, bilobar, or recurrent disease).

        <p>In this respect, it is important to note that we injected the microspheres (as well as the mixture of epirubicin and Lipiodol) through microcatheters (2.7-2.8 French) and until full saturation of the tumour feeding arteries was obtained. This allowed us reaching the maximal administrable dose in a superselective modality using the smallest microspheres (100-300 mm), and hence avoiding the risk of under-treating target lesions, as indirectly confirmed by the high rate of CR we obtained. Therefore, the higher drug dose utilised in the European trial was probably due to a less selective approach and/or a greater median size of the lesions allowing the injection of larger spheres (300-700 mm). Finally, a recent meta-analysis based on seven studies (693 patients) demonstrated that the two procedures had equivalent results, strongly supporting our findings regarding the lack of difference in tumour response between the two procedures (Gao et al, 2013).In this respect, it is important to note that we injected the microspheres (as well as the mixture of epirubicin and Lipiodol) through microcatheters (2.7-2.8 French) and until full saturation of the tumour feeding arteries was obtained.

        <p>As expected, in our study, moderate and severe periprocedural pain was less frequent after DEB-TACE and a lower rate of liver function impairment or SAEs was observed as compared with previous studies (Malagari et al, 2008;Lammer et al, 2010), probably due to the lower doses of anticancer drugs administered. Systemic AEs, such as mucositis, alopecia, and bone marrow toxicity, were not observed in either treatment group. This safe systemic profile of cTACE could be attributed to the superselective technique we used, allowing the infusion of relatively small doses of anticancer agents to fully soak target lesion(s), and the 'on demand' treatment repetition, which reduces the likelihood of AE occurrence with respect to a pre-determined fixed schedule (Ernst et al, 1999;Jang et al, 2004).As expected, in our study, moderate and severe periprocedural pain was less frequent after DEB-TACE and a lower rate of liver function impairment or SAEs was observed as compared with previous studies (Malagari et al, 2008;Lammer et al, 2010), probably due to the lower doses of anticancer drugs administered.

        <p>Previous comparisons between DEB-TACE and cTACE concerning patient survival demonstrated conflicting data. The superiority of DEB-TACE is suggested by two retrospective studies (Dhanasekaran et al, 2010;Song et al, 2012). However, the first one dealt with small and differently sized groups enrolled in different periods (Dhanasekaran et al, 2010). In the second study, the 18month survival rates were 88% in DEB-TACE patients and 61% in cTACE patients, but the achievement of CR with cTACE was surprisingly rare (as already mentioned above) and the survival analysis after the first year of follow-up was based on a very low number of cases at risk (Song et al, 2012). Conversely, a small randomised, single-centre study failed to demonstrate differences between the two techniques in terms of TTP and tumour recurrence and overall survival (Sacco et al, 2011). Finally, statistically significant better overall survival after cTACE with respect to DEB-TACE has emerged from another small retrospective study (Scartozzi et al, 2010).Previous comparisons between DEB-TACE and cTACE concerning patient survival demonstrated conflicting data.

        <p>The principal result of our study was that the type of TACE did not affect 2-year survival, which was instead adversely conditioned by PS 1, low serum albumin, and the presence of multiple tumours. Considering the strong prognostic role of PS, a more favourable PS scenario may explain the higher 2-year survival rates reported by other studies (Burrel et al, 2012;Malagari et al, 2012). The prognostic role of liver function has been already observed in patients undergoing DEB-TACE, with a 2-year survival rate of 88% in Child-Pugh class A and 75% in class B (Malagari et al, 2012). This suggests that the preservation of the extra-tumoural liver is essential for achieving good results with TACE. Therefore, between-arms equivalent liver toxicity was an important determinant of our results regarding survival. Concerning multinodularity, our study confirmed that multifocal hepatocarcinogenesis could decrease the efficacy of TACE, regardless of the technique utilised.The principal result of our study was that the type of TACE did not affect 2-year survival, which was instead adversely conditioned by PS 1, low serum albumin, and the presence of multiple tumours.

        <p>Limitations of the study. The first limitation may derive from the enrolment interruption before reaching the planned sample size. However, it can be pointed out that an accepted reason for stopping a trial is its 'futility', suggested by interim analyses indicating that it is highly unlikely that the study will show any benefit from the experimental treatment (in our case DEB-TACE) as compared with the control treatment (cTACE) if the trial is continued (Casazza and Casella, 2012). Stopping trials for futility makes it possible to save time and research funds for other issues.Limitations of the study.

        <p>Another possible limitation originates from the sample size, which was calculated considering: (1) a 2-year survival rate of 40% in the cTACE group which was a value in between those (31% and 63%) reported by the two randomised studies available at the time we planned the trial (Llovet et al, 2002;Lo et al, 2002), and (2) a 20% superiority of DEB-TACE, an optimistic view suggested by the theoretically superior advantages of the new procedure (Varela et al, 2007).Another possible limitation originates from the sample size, which was calculated considering: (1) a 2-year survival rate of 40% in the cTACE group which was a value in between those (31% and 63%) reported by the two randomised studies available at the time we planned the trial (Llovet et al, 2002;Lo et al, 2002), and (2) a 20% superiority of DEB-TACE, an optimistic view suggested by the theoretically superior advantages of the new procedure (Varela et al, 2007).</p>
        <p>The third limitation is associated with the 'pragmatic design' of our trial, which allowed clinicians to utilise additional treatments at the time of TACE failure (or after a successful downstaging). We chose this approach not only for ethical reasons, but also to compare the two TACE techniques in a setting mimicking what actually happens in clinical practice. As a result, 26 out of 177 patients underwent complementary or sequential treatment. However, the distribution of additional treatments did not differ between the two TACE arms, and the great impact of liver transplant on survival was limited by censoring patients at the time of surgery. It is therefore likely that additional therapy had a similar, if any, weight in the two TACE arms.The third limitation is associated with the 'pragmatic design' of our trial, which allowed clinicians to utilise additional treatments at the time of TACE failure (or after a successful downstaging).

        <p>Finally, our study included BCLC C patients, in whom the use of TACE may be debatable. However, this presence was due to the fact that we did not consider this stage as a contraindication to TACE, if the shift from B to C stage was only caused by PS-1 which, in the ECOG definition, indicated patients 'unable to carry out a strenuous exercise but able to perform the usual activities of normal life'. As a matter of fact, many centres do not consider PS 1 an excluding factor for intra-arterial treatments (Lammer et al, 2010;Malagari et al, 2012), and such a position has been recently endorsed by the Italian guidelines for HCC managements (Bolondi et al, 2013). Nevertheless, this point can be considered in comparing our results with those of other studies using the BCLC B stage and PS1 as thresholds for TACE treatment.Finally, our study included BCLC C patients, in whom the use of TACE may be debatable.

        <p>In conclusion, the present study failed to demonstrate a superiority of DEB-TACE over cTACE in terms of efficacy, safety and, more importantly, 2-year survival. The only benefit of DEB-TACE was a lower incidence and intensity of postprocedural abdominal pain. However, since this did not affect the length of in-hospital stay and patient acceptance of additional TACEs, this marginal advantage is offset, in our opinion, by the higher cost of the new technique. Hence, the routine use of DEB-TACE in clinical practice is debatable, unless further studies can identify patient subgroups in which its use is more beneficial for outcome.In conclusion, the present study failed to demonstrate a superiority of DEB-TACE over cTACE in terms of efficacy, safety and, more importantly, 2-year survival.

However, since this did not affect the length of in-hospital stay and patient acceptance of additional TACEs, this marginal advantage is offset, in our opinion, by the higher cost of the new technique. Hence, the routine use of DEB-TACE in clinical practice is debatable, unless further studies can identify patient subgroups in which its use is more beneficial for outcome.</p>
