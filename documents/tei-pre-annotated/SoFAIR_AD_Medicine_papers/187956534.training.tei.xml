        <p>Background &amp; Aims: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide. The global HCC BRIDGE study was a multiregional, large-scale, longitudinal cohort study undertaken to improve understanding of real-life management of patients with HCC, from diagnosis to death. Methods: Data were collected retrospectively from January 2005 to September 2012 by chart reviews of eligible patients newly diagnosed with HCC at participating institutions. Results: Forty-two sites in 14 countries contributed final data for 18 031 patients. Asia accounted for 67% of patients, Europe for 20% and North America for 13%. As expected, the most common risk factor was hepatitis C virus in North America, Europe and Japan, and hepatitis B virus in China, South Korea and Taiwan. The most common Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage at diagnosis was C in North America, Europe, China and South Korea, and A in Taiwan and Japan. Across all stages, first HCC treatment was most frequently transarterial chemoembolization in North America, Europe, China and South Korea, percutaneous ethanol injection or radiofrequency ablation in Japan and resection in Taiwan. Survival from first HCC treatment varied significantly by region, with median overall survival not reached for Taiwan and 60, 33, 31, 24 and 23 months for Japan, North America, South Korea, Europe and China respectively (P &lt; 0.0001). Conclusions: Initial results from the BRIDGE study confirm previously reported regional trends in patient demographic characteristics and HCC risk factors, document the heterogeneity of treatment approaches across regions/countries and underscore the need for earlier HCC diagnosis worldwide.Background &amp; Aims: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide.

        <p>Worldwide, liver cancer is the fifth most common cancer in men and ninth most common in women (1), with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounting for &gt;90% of primary liver cancer cases (2). In 2012, there were approximately 782 000 new cases and 746 000 deaths from liver cancer worldwide, making it the second most common cause of cancer deaths (after lung cancer) (1). The greatest burden of HCC is in the developing world, with cases in eastern and southeastern Asia, and central and western Africa accounting for more than 80% of the total; 50% of all cases occur in China alone (1).Worldwide, liver cancer is the fifth most common cancer in men and ninth most common in women (1), with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounting for &gt;90% of primary liver cancer cases (2).

        <p>In most cases, HCC develops in cirrhotic livers, and cirrhosis is the strongest risk factor for the disease (3). The variation in incidence and prevalence of HCC by geographical region is primarily a result of regional differences in exposure to causal factors for cirrhosis, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the West and Japan (2)(3)(4). Dietary ingestion of fungal aflatoxins has also been recognized as a major risk factor in southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa (5). Although the incidence of HCC has historically been low in North America and Europe, there is evidence for a significant upward trend in the United States in recent years (6,7), which has been attributed to an increased prevalence of HCV infection (8). The rise in obesity and diabetes worldwide, particularly in North America and Europe, is also leading to recognition of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease as a significant contributor to the aetiology of HCC (8).In most cases, HCC develops in cirrhotic livers, and cirrhosis is the strongest risk factor for the disease (3).

        <p>Potentially curative treatments for HCC include surgery (resection or transplant), radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI); approximately 30-40% of HCC patients globally who are diagnosed with very early (Stage 0) or early (Stage A) disease are eligible for these procedures (2,(9)(10)(11).Potentially curative treatments for HCC include surgery (resection or transplant), radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI); approximately 30-40% of HCC patients globally who are diagnosed with very early (Stage 0) or early (Stage A) disease are eligible for these procedures (2,(9)(10)(11).</p>

        <p>Approximately 25-70% of patients with HCC are diagnosed with advanced-stage disease, which is regarded as incurable (6,7,(12)(13)(14). Patients with advanced HCC have limited treatment options, and chemotherapy provides minimal clinical benefit (14). Sorafenib, a multitargeted kinase inhibitor, is the only systemic agent shown to extend overall survival (OS) compared with placebo in patients with advanced HCC (15). However, the survival benefit with sorafenib is modest (a 2-to 3-month extension in median OS compared with placebo in two phase III trials) (16,17), and there is a pressing need for more effective therapies for patients with advanced HCC.Approximately 25-70% of patients with HCC are diagnosed with advanced-stage disease, which is regarded as incurable (6,7,(12)(13)(14).

        <p>The outcome for patients with HCC treated in randomized clinical trials is unlikely to fully reflect outcomes in daily clinical practice, as the patient populations in each setting are likely to differ considerably (18). Clinical trials employ strict eligibility criteria and, in the case of HCC, are often limited to patients with good liver function to avoid confounding results. Because patients treated in clinical practice may have less thorough follow-up and patient counselling, compliance may be reduced compared with that in clinical trials. Real-world observational studies are needed to gain better insight into the management of patients with HCC (19).The outcome for patients with HCC treated in randomized clinical trials is unlikely to fully reflect outcomes in daily clinical practice, as the patient populations in each setting are likely to differ considerably (18).

        <p>The global HCC BRIDGE ('Bridge to Better Outcomes in HCC') study was the first multiregional, largescale, longitudinal cohort study to document the HCC patient experience from diagnosis to death, and aimed to include all patients, regardless of treatment received (20). The objective was to provide an improved understanding of global patterns of HCC therapy and associated outcomes across real-world clinical practice, with data collected retrospectively from patient charts. Patients were recruited from Asia, Europe and North America, and data were captured for both systemic and non-systemic treatments with the intent to assess HCC management in the real-world setting and compare it with that recommended by therapeutic guidelines, for example the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) guidelines recommended by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) (9) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) (2).The global HCC BRIDGE ('Bridge to Better Outcomes in HCC') study was the first multiregional, largescale, longitudinal cohort study to document the HCC patient experience from diagnosis to death, and aimed to include all patients, regardless of treatment received (20).

        <p>Sites were instructed to enrol all eligible patients on a sequential basis, with data to be extracted on a rolling basis from patient charts by personnel at the study site. A selection scheme was employed to cap enrolment at specific sites when the number of eligible patients exceeded the number allowed by power calculation. Seasonality was avoided by distributing the number of patients entered in a given cohort year based on month of diagnosis (e.g. if 120 patients were entered as part of a cohort, the first 10 eligible patients diagnosed each month would be entered). Study data were entered into a web-based, electronic data-capture system developed by Outcome Sciences, Inc. (Cambridge, MA, USA), and subject to rigorous monthly monitoring and cleaning. Key data collected included patient demographics; HCC risk factors; selected laboratory values required to stage patients; tumour characteristics; HCC-directed therapy; and outcomes. Data on resource use in addition to treatment (e.g. physician visits, type and date of assessments) were also collected.Sites were instructed to enrol all eligible patients on a sequential basis, with data to be extracted on a rolling basis from patient charts by personnel at the study site.

        <p>The results reported here were based on the final data set, including all available data as of September 30, 2012. All eligible patients enrolled in the study were included in the analysis population, with information from patients who did not complete follow-up included in the analyses, unless the patient requested otherwise. The primary measure of treatment outcome was OS, as measured from date of first HCC treatment to death (to be consistent with clinical trial data). Secondary measures of treatment outcome included evidence of disease progression (yes/no), systemic treatment-limiting adverse event and systemic treatment failure, as well as the time to each of these events (also measured from date of starting treatment). Patient follow-up was defined as date of HCC diagnosis or first date on record at the site where the patient was seen for HCC, whichever was earlier, until death or end of study, whichever came first. An ongoing effort to limit the amount of missing data was made by alerting sites to missing data identified during monthly monitoring and cleaning. No missing value imputation technique was applied in the present analysis.The results reported here were based on the final data set, including all available data as of September 30, 2012.

        <p>This report describes the first global and largest-todate observational study in patients with HCC, providing a valuable opportunity to learn from realworld practice in managing this disease. The study data also allow some assessment of the merit of treat- ment guidelines based on the results of rigorously conducted clinical trials. Demographic characteristics and HCC risk factors at diagnosis in the BRIDGE study appeared to confirm well-known trends. The high prevalence of male patients in this study support previous findings that HCC is up to four times more commonly diagnosed in males than in females (1,25,26)]. Similarly, the predominant risk factors identified in the BRIDGE study are consistent with those previously reported (25,27), comprising HBV infection in Asian countries (excluding Japan) and HCV infection in Europe, North America and Japan. The younger mean age at diagnosis in China (and, to some extent, also in South Korea) may reflect vertical transmission of HBV from mother to infant (4). Although HBV was also the most common risk factor in Taiwan, the proportion of affected patients (63%) was lower than in China and South Korea (77 and 75%, respectively), and the mean age at diagnosis in Taiwan was older and similar to that in North America. These observations suggest that the universal HBV vaccination program in Taiwan, which has led to a significant decline in HBsAg carrier rates in the Taiwanese population, may also be influencing the epidemiology of HCC in this country (28,29). The BCLC staging system, which incorporates patient performance status, number and size of nodules, cancer symptoms and liver function, has been proposed as a standard method to determine prognosis and guide treatment selection among patients with HCC by the AASLD and EASL clinical practice guidelines (2,9). In the BRIDGE study, the predominant BCLC stage at diagnosis was stage C in all regions or countries apart from Japan and Taiwan. The high rate of advanced-stage disease at diagnosis underscores the need for earlier diagnosis of HCC, and suggests that surveillance efforts for HCC could be improved in many countries. Although Japan, Taiwan and South Korea have all introduced surveillance programs (30)(31)(32)(33), governmentfunded or national surveillance programs have yet to be established in China (32,33), or in countries in Europe or North America.This report describes the first global and largest-todate observational study in patients with HCC, providing a valuable opportunity to learn from realworld practice in managing this disease. The study data also allow some assessment of the merit of treat- ment guidelines based on the results of rigorously conducted clinical trials. Demographic characteristics and HCC risk factors at diagnosis in the BRIDGE study appeared to confirm well-known trends. The high prevalence of male patients in this study support previous findings that HCC is up to four times more commonly diagnosed in males than in females (1,25,26)]. Similarly, the predominant risk factors identified in the BRIDGE study are consistent with those previously reported (25,27), comprising HBV infection in Asian countries (excluding Japan) and HCV infection in Europe, North America and Japan. The younger mean age at diagnosis in China (and, to some extent, also in South Korea) may reflect vertical transmission of HBV from mother to infant (4). Although HBV was also the most common risk factor in Taiwan, the proportion of affected patients (63%) was lower than in China and South Korea (77 and 75%, respectively), and the mean age at diagnosis in Taiwan was older and similar to that in North America. These observations suggest that the universal HBV vaccination program in Taiwan, which has led to a significant decline in HBsAg carrier rates in the Taiwanese population, may also be influencing the epidemiology of HCC in this country (28,29).

        <p>The observed differences in disease stage at diagnosis (later in South Korea compared with Taiwan and Japan) and median OS (31 months for South Korea compared with not reached in Taiwan and 60 months in Japan) suggest that surveillance programs in Japan and Taiwan may have been more effective than the program in South Korea, although data from the single site in South Korea may not well reflect the general outcome for the country-wide program. These results could also reflect differences in surveillance program design (with respect to screening tools used, frequency of testing and target population), in implementation and uptake (affected by the proportion of population funded by the government and commitment of clinicians) or a mixture of these factors. Whether patients were diagnosed during surveillance was a data point captured for each patient in this study. However, the way this question was understood by personnel entering data appears to have differed across the participating sites, precluding our ability to clearly assess the influence of surveillance on the overall study results. Evidence from one of the participating sites in the United States does suggest that surveillance can have a positive effect on patient outcomes. In a retrospective analysis of all patients diagnosed with HCC from 2007-2009 (n = 460) at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, patients diagnosed during surveillance had less advanced disease, were more likely to be eligible for potentially curative treatments and had increased survival times (after 40 months of follow up, median OS not reached in patients diagnosed during surveillance vs. 12.5 months in patients not diagnosed during surveillance, P &lt; 0.001) (34).The observed differences in disease stage at diagnosis (later in South Korea compared with Taiwan and Japan) and median OS (31 months for South Korea compared with not reached in Taiwan and 60 months in Japan) suggest that surveillance programs in Japan and Taiwan may have been more effective than the program in South Korea, although data from the single site in South Korea may not well reflect the general outcome for the country-wide program.

        <p>While widely recognized to be essential for the effective treatment of patients with the disease, surveillancesupported early diagnosis of HCC also results in lead-time bias that increases OS (35). This is consistent with our finding of superior OS (not adjusted for leadtime bias) for patients in Taiwan and Japan when compared with China, Europe, South Korea and North America (see Fig. 4B). However, there were also differences in survival between regions or countries where the distribution of stage at diagnosis was similar; for example, median OS in North America and South Korea was better than that observed in Europe or China. This may reflect variation in data collection, patient populations (other than stage at diagnosis) or variation in management including treatment patterns. As expected, median OS decreased with progressing BCLC stage (see Fig. 4A), supporting the prognostic utility of the BCLC staging system. Our estimates of 27, 15 and 4 months for median OS for BCLC stages B, C and D, respectively, are somewhat higher than those reported for clinical trials in the literature: ~20 months for BCLC stage B (36), ~10 months for BCLC stage C treated with sorafenib in the SHARP trial ( 16) and 3 months for BCLC stage D (36). The BRIDGE study showed differences in choice of first treatment by region and stage at diagnosis. In earlystage disease (stage 0 or stage A), for which resection, liver transplant or RFA/PEI are recommended by the AASLD/EASL guidelines as potentially curative treatments (2, 9), PEI/RFA, resection and TACE were the most frequently used first treatments. The use of TACE in these patients is inconsistent with the AASLD/EASL guidelines. However, some of these cases may be explained by the use of TACE as neoadjuvant therapy, highlighting a possible limitation in the way the data were collected. Indeed, pre-operative TACE has been used extensively in patients with resectable HCC, although a systematic review of the literature has concluded that TACE in this setting does not improve disease-free survival (37). TACE is also frequently used prior to liver transplantation, and approximately 30% of patients receiving TACE in North America subsequently underwent liver transplantation (see Fig. 3). An additional explanation for TACE in BCLC stage A is that these patients are either unfit or partial responders to curative therapies. In North America, a fair number of patients who were candidates for transplantation instead received TACE or RFA as first treatment, which may have also resulted in down-staging. Although combination therapy with TACE or RFA plus transplantation was the actual intention, TACE/RFA and transplantation were counted separately given the observational nature of the BRIDGE study.While widely recognized to be essential for the effective treatment of patients with the disease, surveillancesupported early diagnosis of HCC also results in lead-time bias that increases OS (35).

        <p>Despite the known efficacy of liver transplantation, only a minority of patients received this procedure. Possible reasons include ineffective or non-existent identification and surveillance of transplant-suitable candidates, as well as limited availability of organ donors. However, data on whether patients were placed on a transplant registry were not collected as part of the BRIDGE study, limiting its ability to further inform on this issue. It should also be recognized that the treatment patterns observed were also likely influenced by substantial regional differences in practice related to access and cost. While all participating centres likely reflect the best care that can be delivered in each country, what constitutes best care in a resource-rich country (e.g. the United States) will differ from best care offered in less resource-rich countries (e.g. China). Given this difference, it is perhaps not surprising that transplant and systemic therapy with sorafenib, two resourceintensive treatments, were used more frequently in North America and Europe than elsewhere. In addition, in countries with nationalized healthcare and limited resources, the use of transplant and high-cost/low-benefit treatments like sorafenib are likely to be constrained by public policies aimed at delivering benefits broadly across the population in need.Despite the known efficacy of liver transplantation, only a minority of patients received this procedure.

        <p>The BCLC treatment algorithm, adopted by AASLD/ EASL guidelines, recommends the use of sorafenib for stage C disease (2). However, in the real-world BRIDGE study, use of sorafenib as first recorded treatment was low, despite the high number of patients diagnosed with BCLC stage C disease. Since sorafenib efficacy is considered modest, many physicians may have tried to reduce the tumour burden directly by locoregional therapies, which could be expected to result in survival gain. Alternatively, the use of first-line sorafenib may have been affected by intercountry variations in access, as noted above. Rather than sorafenib, TACE and resection were the most frequent first recorded treatments for patients with stage C disease. This finding underscores the unmet need for evaluating the outcome of surgical resection vs. locoregional therapy vs. systemic therapy in advanced stage HCC (14,38). In patients with BCLC stage D disease, the proportion who received palliative care was surprisingly low across these real-world settings, and the proportion who received liver transplant was surprisingly high. This may have reflected liver transplantation of patients with Child-Pugh class C or ECOG/WHO performance status greater than 2 who otherwise have liver disease meeting Milan criteria. It is unclear, however, what proportion of stage D patients received best supportive care [as recommended by the BCLC treatment algorithm and by the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL) consensus guidelines (2,35)], which may not always have been captured in our data collection under 'palliative care'. In our analysis, any patient who did not receive a definitive therapy was assumed to have received best supportive care only.The BCLC treatment algorithm, adopted by AASLD/ EASL guidelines, recommends the use of sorafenib for stage C disease (2).

        <p>Analysis of first recorded treatment by region shows that sorafenib was used more frequently in North America, Europe and South Korea, compared with China, Taiwan and Japan, possibly reflecting later regulatory approval as well as reduced access to sorafenib in Asia. Additionally, resection and TACE were the most frequently recorded first treatments in China, Taiwan and South Korea, compared with TACE and PEI/RFA in Europe and Japan, and TACE, PEI/RFA and resection in North America. This variation in first recorded treatment by region may be because of real differences in the accepted management strategies in Western countries, where the BCLC treatment algorithm is most widely used, compared with Asian countries, where other guidelines predominate. The latter include Japanese guidelines for HCC first compiled in 2005 (21,39), South Korean guidelines initially published in 2003 and updated in 2009 (22), and the APASL consensus guideline for treatment of HCC (35). Further analysis of how such regional guidelines might have influenced the practice patterns reported here, particularly in China, is ongoing.Analysis of first recorded treatment by region shows that sorafenib was used more frequently in North America, Europe and South Korea, compared with China, Taiwan and Japan, possibly reflecting later regulatory approval as well as reduced access to sorafenib in Asia.

        <p>The primary strengths of the BRIDGE study are the large patient population, wide geographical spread and the capture of real-world clinical practice data from patient charts. However, as with all observational cohort studies, the BRIDGE study also has many limitations. Because it is a medical chart-review study, the robustness of the data depends on the thoroughness of each site's understanding and documentation of medical history, treatment and response. Missing data and loss of patients to follow-up are additional limitations of observational studies and may affect the results and their interpretation. Although substantial effort was made to encourage complete collection of all requested data at the participating sites, there are some results reported here (as noted in Table 1) for which the proportion of missing data was &gt;30%. In addition, it is possible that the results are not generalizable because the study was performed at tertiary referral centres, which might be expected to provide the best care available in each country. In an attempt to maximize generalization of results across a particular country, study sites were selected where patient populations had HCC etiologist consistent with previously reported national patterns. In the case of single sites within one country (Taiwan, South Korea and Japan), sites were additionally chosen to be representative of the practice of other centres in the country. However, it is possible that more treatable patients with better liver function and good performance status may have been enrolled, thereby introducing a selection bias. In particular, the lack of enrolled BCLC stage D patients in China (2%), as well as the low proportion with Child-Pugh stage B and C (12 and 1%, respectively), suggest that such patients were not seen at the participating sites and may therefore not have been included in the study. Similarly, the relatively low rates of patients reporting alcohol abuse in China, Taiwan and Japan suggest that such patients also may not have been treated at the participating sites for some reason (for example, such patients might be expected to be less likely to seek and receive care at a tertiary centre, and less likely to be supported in doing so). These low rates could also, however, reflect under-reporting because of the possible stigma associated with admitting such abuse in some countries. WHO estimates of per capita alcohol consumption (litres of pure alcohol) for 2011 were 9.4 for the United States, 12.2 for Europe, 5.9 for China, 14.8 for South Korea and 8.0 for Japan (40). Given these figures and the known strong interaction between alcohol abuse and other risk factors for HCC, the reported rates of alcohol abuse for China (24%), Taiwan (18%) and especially Japan (2%) seem unexpectedly low. These conjectures regarding potentially 'missing' advancedstage patients may help to explain the possibly higherthan-expected median OS reported here for China. They could also contribute to the superior OS seen here for Taiwan and Japan, but this more likely can be attributed to the aforementioned lead-time bias, as well as, particularly in the case of Taiwan, artificial inflation because of the effects of censoring, which makes the OS reported here increasingly less reliable with time. Finally, interactions between variables in such a large sample size as the population in this study are hard to control, and our results must accordingly be interpreted with caution.The primary strengths of the BRIDGE study are the large patient population, wide geographical spread and the capture of real-world clinical practice data from patient charts.

        <p>In conclusion, these real-world findings from the BRIDGE study provide a broad overview of the current state of HCC treatment and document the heterogeneity of treatment approaches across regions and in different countries. Results from the study confirm previously reported regional trends in patient demographic characteristics and HCC risk factors, underscore the need for earlier diagnosis of HCC worldwide, and also suggest that treatment guidelines may benefit from re-evaluation. The data from Taiwan and Japan, in particular, suggest it may be possible to improve outcomes by focusing on identifying high-risk individuals and then following them with surveillance to achieve early detection. It is hoped that information obtained from the BRIDGE study will help identify unmet clinical needs and contribute to the development of new treatment paradigms that ultimately improve outcomes in patients with HCC. The study has generated a very large dataset which could potentially be used to address unanswered research hypotheses and is available for further analysis by interested investigators. Additional analyses of potential value could include the aforementioned survival by treatment type, including systemic vs. non-systemic therapy, assessment of regional practice vs. regional guidelines, as well as exploratory identification of possible predictors of survival, such as changes in tumour size or AFP levels over time. accommodations/meeting expenses to international symposiums Bayer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Gilead Sciences.
