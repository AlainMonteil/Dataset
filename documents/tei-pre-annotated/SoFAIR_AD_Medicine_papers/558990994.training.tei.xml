        <p>Although in patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure and hypoxemia are the primary causes of admission to intensive care units, kidney involvement is also common. While any specific pathophysiology of underlying COVID-related acute kidney injury (AKI) remains largely unknown, in keeping with most AKI seen in critical care, the cause is likely multifactorial although recent findings have highlighted potential pathophysiological pathways. Here, we will discuss the currently available evidence behind the different proposed mechanisms of AKI complicating COVID-19 infection, including the histopathological findings highlighting the similarities and contrast with that known from the pathophysiology of AKI in non-COVIDrelated sepsis. Where performed, histopathological studies commonly demonstrate acute tubular injury, although as observed in patients with sepsis associated AKI this is often mild despite significantly deranged function. Systemic hemodynamics instability very likely contributes to tubular injury. Furthermore, although the cytokine storm syndrome has been much lauded, evidence shows lower levels of circulating cytokines (including Interleukin-6, TNF-a, etc.) compared to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to causes other than COVID-19, septic shock or other cytokine release syndromes. Tissue inflammation and local immune cell infiltration (including macrophages and dendritic cells) have been repeatedly observed and may play a critical role, as may endothelial injury and microvascular thrombi. Decreased viral clearance and an impaired type 1 interferon response have been reported in severe COVID-19 patients. Findings of higher RNA load of SARS-CoV2 in patients who died with AKI compared to those without AKI suggest a contribution of viral invasion in the kidneys even though this issue remains controversial. In light of these observations, the potential pathophysiological mechanisms of COVID-19-related AKI may provide insights into therapeutic strategies.Although in patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure and hypoxemia are the primary causes of admission to intensive care units, kidney involvement is also common.

        <p>The severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first described in December 2019 and is responsible for the disease coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) which has led to the global pandemic. The pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 are well described but it is increasingly recognized that AKI is a common complication of the disease, often presenting at hospital admission. Whilst initial reports from China suggested relatively low rates of kidney involvement [1][2][3][4] , subsequent reports from the United States and Europe indicate much higher rates of AKI particularly in the intensive care setting (ICU) with up to 45% requiring kidney replacement therapy (KRT) [5][6][7][8] . It is known that mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and AKI is higher than those without renal involvement 8,9 . As with all AKI in the context of multi-organ failure requiring ICU admission, mortality in patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 associated AKI requiring KRT is especially high 10 . Anecdotal reports of lack of renal recovery in those who survive compared to other forms of AKI is of particular concern 9,7,10 but long-term patient outcomes are not yet fully understood as this is complicated by prolonged hospital admissions as well as a lack of reported follow-up. Ascertaining the true epidemiology of COVID-19 associated AKI is difficult due to differences in underlying co-morbidities of the populations examined as well as possible variations in practice and methods of AKI measurement. Age, past medical history of hypertension, diabetes have repeatedly been associated with a higher risk of AKI in this setting. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a well identified risk factor for AKI in hospitalized patients, and was indicated as the most relevant risk factor for AKI requiring KRT in 3099 critically ill patients with COVID-19 9 . Indeed, several epidemiologic studies worldwide clearly demonstrated that CKD represents a relevant and independent risk factor for a worse outcome in COVID- 19. In a recent case-control study comparing COVID-19 patients with the Danish general population matched for age, gender and comorbidities, lower eGFR levels were associated with an increased rate of hospital-diagnosed COVID-19 and death 10 . OpenSAFELY project from ERA-EDTA analyzed variables associated with COVID-19 death in about 17 millions of patients: of note, CKD (HR 2.52 for patients with eGFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m2) was one of the most prevalent comorbidities associated with a worse outcome 11 . Moreover, CKD is often associated with other comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity linked to an increased mortality rate 3 . In this clinical scenario, the high mortality observed in comorbid and elderly patients may be related to a reduced renal functional reserve (RFR), the capacity of the kidney to increase GFR in response to stress and strongly dependent on functioning nephron mass 12 decreased GFR and RFR levels may support the development of AKI as assessed by epidemiologic studies. In 4020 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan (China), 285 (7.09%) of them were identified as AKI. Both early and late forms of AKI were characterized by an increased risk of in-hospital mortality: moreover, CKD, older age and levels of inflammatory biomarkers were associated with increased risk of late AKI 13 . In 1603 consecutive patients admitted to a University Reference Hospital in Spain, 43.5% of patients elevated serum creatinine at admission had previous CKD and 11.4% developed AKI 14 . In 777 patients hospitalized in Genoa (Italy), AKI developed in 176 (22.6%): of these, 79 (45%) showed an acute worsening of a preexisting CKD, and 21 (12%) required kidney replacement therapy. Independent variables for AKI development were the presence of CKD, C-reactive protein (CRP) and ventilatory support 15 . Nevertheless, it is clear that the pathophysiology is multifactorial and different sub-phenotypes of COVID-associated AKI exist. In this review, we will discuss the current understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 associated AKI examining potential mechanisms as well as non-specific factors related to critical illness (Figure 1).The severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first described in December 2019 and is responsible for the disease coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) which has led to the global pandemic.

        <p>The incidence and severity of AKI in the setting of COVID-19 infection depends on the clinical setting. Most studies utilize the KDIGO (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes) consensus definition of AKI and several studies have reported that upwards of 30-50% of all patients hospitalized with COVID-19 related illnesses develop some form of AKI with the proportion increasing in those requiring intensive care 11,9,12,3,13,7. In a meta-analysis, among hospitalized COVID-19 patients the pooled incidence of AKI was 28.6% [(95% CI 19.8-39.5]) in the USA and Europe and 5.5% (95% CI 4.1-7.4) in China 16 . Among patients admitted to the ICU, 46% were reported to have AKI, with up to 78% in those requiring intubation 17 .The incidence and severity of AKI in the setting of COVID-19 infection depends on the clinical setting.

        <p>Additionally, amongst those in the ICU, kidney replacement therapy (KRT) was reported to be up to 20% [18][19][20]21,22 . In a large-scale retrospective observational cohort of a New York City Health Care System, 46% of 3,993 inpatients developed AKI with 39%, 19% and 42% having KDIGO Stage 1, 2 and 3 AKI respectively 19 . These data are mirrored in a separate and distinct New York based cohort of 3,854 patients with inpatient COVID-19 AKI (39.9% of the larger cohort) with 1644 (42.7%) having stage 1, 840 (21.8%) having stage 2 and 1370 (35.5%) having Stage 3 AKI 8 . In this second cohort which also included both ward and ICU patients, 638 of the 1,370 with Stage 3 AKI (46.5%, or 16.6% of total) received KRT. Importantly both of these studies are limited in that they only used the serum creatinine criteria of the KDIGO consensus definitions to identify those with AKI. Of note, wide geographic disparities in the incidence of AKI among US veteran patients hospitalized with COVID-19 have been reported ranging from 10% to 56%. Of note, rates of AKI declined over time (from 40% in March to 27% in July). This suggests that changes in patients management impacted the incidence rate of AKI 23 .Additionally, amongst those in the ICU, kidney replacement therapy (KRT) was reported to be up to 20% [18][19][20]21,22 .

        <p>Early reports of COVID-19 AKI noted the presence of hematuria and/or proteinuria 1,18 with one cohort study (n=701) noting that 44% of patients presented with proteinuria and 26% presented with hematuria 2 where greater amounts of hematuria or proteinuria (2-3+) had a stronger association with risk of hospital mortality in a "step wise dose effect" 2,18 . More recent cohort studies have demonstrated much higher rates of proteinuria (defined as a protein-creatinine ratio of &gt; 0.5, 1+ or high on dipstick or &gt;30 mg/dl on urinalysis) and hematuria (defined as 1+ or higher on dipstick / urinalysis) with 80% in patients with AKI 19 . Furthermore over 50% of those without AKI defined by KDIGO serum creatinine criteria had hematuria and over 70% presented with proteinuria. This presence of urinalysis abnormalities in those not meeting the definition of AKI suggests that kidney injury is occurring without significant functional change acutely. Fanconi syndrome (proteinuria, renal phosphate leak, hyperuricosuria and normoglycaemic glycosuria) were reported to precede episodes of AKI 24 (Figure 2). This presentation is in keeping with Stage 1S of a newly released AKI staging, when there is evidence of kidney injury that is not detected by creatinine and urine output criteria 25 .Early reports of COVID-19 AKI noted the presence of hematuria and/or proteinuria 1,18 with one cohort study (n=701) noting that 44% of patients presented with proteinuria and 26% presented with hematuria 2 where greater amounts of hematuria or proteinuria (2-3+) had a stronger association with risk of hospital mortality in a "step wise dose effect" 2,18 .

        <p>The proteinuria detected is of low molecular weight rather than albuminuria suggesting tubular origin rather than a reflection of glomerular injury and can identify patients in the early stage of AKI 26 . The contribution of underlying CKD is unknown, but the proportion of COVID-19 patients with proteinuria far exceeds the prevalence of stage 1 and 2 CKD in the general population 27 . Future studies are required to examine the role of other biomarkers of glomerular and tubular function to determine their association with serum creatinine-based AKI.The proteinuria detected is of low molecular weight rather than albuminuria suggesting tubular origin rather than a reflection of glomerular injury and can identify patients in the early stage of AKI 26 .

        <p>Additionally, these data should be used in combination with the growing body of literature describing the myriad of pathologic findings that have been seen on COVID-19 AKI kidney biopsies (e.g. collapsing glomerulosclerosis, thrombotic microangiopathy, direct viral tropism and classic tubular injury) [28][29][30][31][32] (Figure 2). Integration of these pathologic findings with clinical data can potentially further inform the pathophysiology of COVID-associated AKI and recent evidence from France on biopsy data from 47 patients demonstrated that predominantly tubular damage is seen in cases with the most severe respiratory disease on ICU (66.7%) whereas collapsing glomerulopathy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was not seen in critically ill patients but in 70.6% of cases not in the ICU 33 . More than 2 co-existing comorbidities were seen in over 60% of cases and the occurrence of collapsing glomerulopathy was highly correlated with the expression of high-risk APOL1 genotypes.Additionally, these data should be used in combination with the growing body of literature describing the myriad of pathologic findings that have been seen on COVID-19 AKI kidney biopsies (e.g. collapsing glomerulosclerosis, thrombotic microangiopathy, direct viral tropism and classic tubular injury) [28][29][30][31][32] (Figure 2).

        <p>The pathophysiology of COVID-19-associated AKI involves local and systemic inflammation and immune responses, endothelial injury and coagulation activation as well as activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system 30,34 . Direct viral infection with renal tropism of the virus has also been proposed but remains controversial 35 . Non-specific factors common in critical illness such as mechanical ventilation, hypoxia, hypotension, low cardiac output or nephrotoxic agents may also be responsible in the most severely affects patients (Table 2).The pathophysiology of COVID-19-associated AKI involves local and systemic inflammation and immune responses, endothelial injury and coagulation activation as well as activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system 30,34 .

        <p>Renal biopsies among 17 patients with AKI (n=15) or proteinuria but mild COVID-19 symptoms for most, revealed acute tubular injury (n=14, 82%), collapsing glomerulopathy (n=7, 41%) and endothelial injury/thrombotic microangiopathy (n=6, 35%) were the most common histologic findings 40 (Table 1). One case showed acute glomerulonephritis with no evidence of direct infection of the kidney by SARS-CoV-2. A recent series from France demonstrated tubular injury in the sickest cohort whereas glomerular pathology was restricted to the non-ICU patients 33 . Of note, most biopsies were performed several weeks after onset of COVID-19 symptoms. This is in line with most biopsy studies failing to show significant SARS-CoV-2 infection of the kidney. Previous studies reported direct viral tropism but concerns have been raised regarding the methods used and the possibility of virus-like images such as normal vesicles from intracellular organelles and multivesicular bodies leading to false positive results 35,41,42,43 . However, Braun et al reported infective virus in an autopsied kidney that could replicate in vitro in non-human primate kidney tubular epithelial cells 44 . In this autopsy series, the authors further identified that 23 of 32 patients with AKI (72%) showed viral RNA in the renal tissue while only 3 of 7 (43%) were found in patients without AKI. In another autopsy study among 6 COVID-19 patients using microdissection, SARS-CoV-2 was found in different kidney compartments, particularly in the glomerulus 42 . Viral RNA and protein were also detected using in situ hybridization with confocal microscopy. The presence of SARS-CoV2 particles have been sporadically observed in the urine too 32,45,46 . This suggest concomitant release by damage tubular cells or filtration of fragments of the virus since the high molecular weight of SARS-CoV2 ( 600-kDa) should not allow it to be filtered the glomerular membrane 47 .Renal biopsies among 17 patients with AKI (n=15) or proteinuria but mild COVID-19 symptoms for most, revealed acute tubular injury (n=14, 82%), collapsing glomerulopathy (n=7, 41%) and endothelial injury/thrombotic microangiopathy (n=6, 35%) were the most common histologic findings 40 (Table 1).

        <p>Collapsing glomerulopathy was reported in several patients with COVID-19 (Table 1), described initially as COVID-19 associated nephropathy (COVAN) mostly in patients with non-severe respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 and isolated AKI or presenting with glomerular proteinuria 29,31,33 . Collapsing glomerulopathy has previously been described in various conditions including HIV and other viral infection infections (e.g. parvovirus B19, cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus). Collapsing glomerulopathy is associated with highrisk APOL1 genotypes, mostly in black patients. The true incidence of collapsing glomerulopathy and its contribution versus other underlying conditions (e.g. hypertension, CKD) toward the risk of COVID-associated nephropathy is unknown. Although the exact pathophysiology in COVAN remains unknown, it may share common mechanisms with HIVinfected patients with podocyte injury through disruption of autophagy and mitochondrial homeostasis 30 .Collapsing glomerulopathy was reported in several patients with COVID-19 (Table 1), described initially as COVID-19 associated nephropathy (COVAN) mostly in patients with non-severe respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 and isolated AKI or presenting with glomerular proteinuria 29,31,33 .

        <p>Biomarkers of coagulation and fibrinolysis activation (e.g. fibrinogen, D-dimer) have been repeatedly associated with an increased risk of death in COVID-19 patients. Autopsy studies report a 9-fold higher incidence of observed micro-and macrovascular thrombosis in lungs from COVID-19 patients compared to influenza pneumonia 48 and systemic micro-and macrovascular thrombosis have been repeatedly reported in COVID-19 in other organs, including the kidneys 49- 51 . Many critical illnesses are associated with microvascular and endothelial injury but SARS-CoV2 is believed to have a specific impact on the endothelial activation. Post-mortem studies report vascular endothelialitis in COVID-19 48,52 and suspicion of viral infection of renal endothelial cells 52 , but the use of electronic microscopy lacks specificity to confirm endothelial infection and evidence of direct viral infection of renal endothelial cells is lacking. Increase in plasma biomarkers of endothelial injury (sE-selectin, sP-selectin, Ang-2, sICAM-1, VWF antigen) and platelets (soluble thrombomodulin ) and activation has been associated with poor prognosis 53,54,55 . Microvascular inflammation is known to trigger endothelial activation, leading to vasodilation, increased vascular permeability and pro-thrombotic conditions in other conditions [56][57][58] . Complement activation, as suggested by increased circulating levels of soluble C5b9 and C5a and by tissue deposition of C5b9 and C4d in lung and kidney tissues 5960,61 , has been proposed to contribute to further promote inflammation and coagulation pathways in COVID-19. Release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from necrotic cell death may further contribute to endothelial injury in COVID-19 62 . SARS-CoV2 was furthermore shown to bind to platelets ACE2, activate platelets and promote immunothrombosis [63][64][65] , making platelet activation a potential player in the pathophysiology of COVID-associated AKI 66,67 .Biomarkers of coagulation and fibrinolysis activation (e.g. fibrinogen, D-dimer) have been repeatedly associated with an increased risk of death in COVID-19 patients. Autopsy studies report a 9-fold higher incidence of observed micro-and macrovascular thrombosis in lungs from COVID-19 patients compared to influenza pneumonia 48 and systemic micro-and macrovascular thrombosis have been repeatedly reported in COVID-19 in other organs, including the kidneys 49- 51 . Many critical illnesses are associated with microvascular and endothelial injury but SARS-CoV2 is believed to have a specific impact on the endothelial activation. Post-mortem studies report vascular endothelialitis in COVID-19 48,52 and suspicion of viral infection of renal endothelial cells 52 , but the use of electronic microscopy lacks specificity to confirm endothelial infection and evidence of direct viral infection of renal endothelial cells is lacking. Increase in plasma biomarkers of endothelial injury (sE-selectin, sP-selectin, Ang-2, sICAM-1, VWF antigen) and platelets (soluble thrombomodulin ) and activation has been associated with poor prognosis 53,54,55 . Microvascular inflammation is known to trigger endothelial activation, leading to vasodilation, increased vascular permeability and pro-thrombotic conditions in other conditions [56][57][58] . Complement activation, as suggested by increased circulating levels of soluble C5b9 and C5a and by tissue deposition of C5b9 and C4d in lung and kidney tissues 5960,61 , has been proposed to contribute to further promote inflammation and coagulation pathways in COVID-19.

        <p>Several alterations of both innate and adaptive immune response following SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported. Immunosenescence, a term used to define innate and adaptive immunological alterations occurring with aging, is characterized by inflamm-aging, a low-grade inflammatory state that may play a key role in the determination of organ dysfunction, and by ineffective T cell response and antibody production. These features have been reported in COVID-19 and may explain partially the increased mortality in the elderly and comorbid population due to an inefficient viral clearance, enhanced cytokine/chemokine release, endothelial damage and activation of the coagulation and complement cascades 74 .Several alterations of both innate and adaptive immune response following SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported.

        <p>However, a note of caution should be emphasized on the role of IFN in COVID-19-associated kidney damage: from one side, IFN blockade may limit the systemic inflammatory reaction due to SARS-CoV-2 replication; on the other hand, IFNs are well known mediators of glomerular injury. Indeed, IFN-α and IFN-β exert differential effects on podocytes and parietal epithelial cells, enhancing podocyte loss and promoting glomerulosclerosis 81 . Moreover, different inflammatory stimuli can lead to the development of proteinuric diseases that may be ascribed to podocyte injury following cytokine release and activation of type 1 IFN signalling 82 .

        <p>A relevant piece of the puzzle in innate immune response to viral infections is represented by the activation of the complement cascade although persistent and uncontrolled activation of the complement system may promote an inflammatory process finally leading to tissue injury. It has been shown that plasma levels of the soluble form of C5b9 and of the anaphylatoxin C5a were significantly higher in patients with COVID-19, particularly in the most severe forms of disease 84 .

        <p>Macor and coworkers confirmed multi-organ complement activation, in particular complement deposits were observed in tubular epithelial cells and vessels with only mild C5b-9 staining in glomeruli 61 . Complement activation seems to have a predominant role in COVID-19-associated endothelial dysfunction: C5a fraction can directly bind to C5aR located on endothelial cells inducing the upregulation of Tissue Factor (TF) and loss of thrombomodulin, thus inducing activation of coagulation, exocytosis of P-selectin and ultra-large multimers of von Willebrand factor leading to increased platelet adhesion and aggregation. C5b-9 also contributes to endothelial dysfunction, increased vascular permeability, triggering of inflammation and coagulation 59,85,86 . Moreover, the binding of C5a on specific receptor present on tubular epithelial cells leads to DNA methylation of genes involved in cellular senescence, thus potentially promoting AKI persistence and progression toward CKD due to early fibrosis processes 87 . Taken together, these findings suggest that COVID-19 can be considered a thrombo-inflammatory disease and that the blockade of the complement cascade seems to be one of the potential therapeutic options to limit AKI, multiple organ failure and disease severity 88 . In a small cohort of hemodialysis patients, levels of plasma C3a and C5a were elevated prior to clinical deterioration in patients who developed severe disease suggesting that complement activation preceded severe symptoms 89 . Several studies also addressed the presence of an inadequate adaptive immune response: CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphopenia represent typical features of the most severe forms of COVID-19 90 . Other alterations of immune cells found in severe COVID-19 are the depletion of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, a major source of IFN-alpha, and of eosinophils 91 . A significant decrease of NK cell count was also noticed 91 . An intriguing hypothesis is the potential therapeutic approach represented by the increased expression of the antioxidant and anti-senescent transcription factor Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) -like 2 (Nrf2). Nrf2 is maintained in an inactive state in the cytosol by association with its inhibitor protein KEAP1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1): in response to oxidative stress such as that observed in viral infections, KEAP1 is inactivated and Nrf2 is released to induce Nrf2responsive genes able to protect against stress-induced cell death. On this basis, Nrf2 has been suggested as the master regulator of tissue damage during infection. These pathways have been shown to be suppressed in biopsies from COVID-19 patients and Nrf2 agonist drugs can induce a distinct IFN-independent antiviral activity 92 : randomized clinical trials based on the administration of senolytic drugs in COVID-19 patients are currently ongoing 93 . Up to now, the protective role of Nrf2 activation in COVID-19-associated AKI is merely speculative: however, recent data from experimental AKI in other settings generated this hypothesis.

        <p>demonstrated that increased T cell expression of Nrf2 induced renal functional and histologic protection associated with significant lower levels of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL-17 94 . In addition, in ischemic and nephrotoxic models of AKI, Nrf2-deficiency has been shown to enhance susceptibility to tissue injury, confirming the role of this transcription factor as a potential therapeutic target 95 . Evaluating humoral immunity, some groups of COVID-19 patients exhibited a decreased B cell percentage and a concomitant increase of circulating plasmablasts 96 . As already underlined, a specific antibody response with a significant IgG component is essential to control viral infection: however, the above-mentioned mechanisms of immune senescence may lead to T cell exhaustion as well as to the aberrant production of tissue-specific autoantibodies. As reported for the formation of anti-IFN autoantibodies, immunosenescence may be responsible for a theory of autoimmune response directed to the soluble form of ACE2 that acts as a dummy receptor: the soluble form of ACE2 (sACE2) present in the blood and in extracellular fluids may act as an inactivator molecule for SARS-CoV-2 as described for other types of pathogenic viruses 97 . However, the high affinity of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for ACE2 may lead to the formation of SARS-CoV-2-sACE2 complexes and to the consequent development of anti-ACE2 autoantibodies that can target tissue ACE2 creating vasculitis-like lesions after the early infective phase of the virus 98,99 . More recent studies reinforced the fact that COVID-19 can be characterized by the presence of a robust autoimmune response with IgM directed to ACE2, the receptor allowing viral entry into the cells: purified anti-ACE2 IgM are able to activate complement in endothelial cells as observed in autopsy lung histology studies, thus confirming the angiocentric pathology of the most severe cases of disease 100 . Of note, anti-ACE2 IgM production has been associated with a robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein IgG response, suggesting the possible presence of an anti-idiotype IgM response cross-reacting with ACE2 98 . Considering the wide expression of ACE2 in different organs including the kidney, a role of anti-ACE2 autoantibodies cannot be excluded, leading to ACE1/ACE2 ratio modulation with the consequent worsening of tissue edema, inflammation and damage 101 . However, this theory remains to be validated. Furthermore, the relevant homology between ACE and ACE2 proteins may lead to the cross-reactivity with ACE receptor 102 .

        <p>Cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) is viewed as a life threatening condition with organs failure characterized by rapid proliferation and hyperactivation of all components of the immune system including T cells, macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells and the increased production and release of over 150 chemical mediators and inflammatory cytokines 105 . The inflammatory response of COVID-19 bears similarities to other conditions that are also referred to as exhibiting the CSS, including primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) 106 . In severe COVID-19 infection, a CSS has been proposed as part of the "hyperinflammatory state" observed with marked elevations of acute phase reactants, lymphopenia, coagulation defects and in some cases of SARS-CoV2. Elevated levels of cytokines have been documented in patients with COVID-19 suggesting hyperactivation of the humoral immune response, including interleukin (IL)-6, as a critical mediator particularly for multiorgan dysfunction, including AKI 107,108 . A recent meta-analysis has reported that IL-6 levels are elevated and significantly associated with adverse clinical outcomes, including ICU admission, ARDS and death 109 . In these severe cases nearly three-fold higher serum IL-6 levels were observed within a range of 7.9-283 pg/ml although variable timing of IL-6 measurement, the type of assay as well as differences in the adjuvant immunomodulatory medications received, such as corticosteroids, may have affected both IL-6 response and patient outcomes. However, the levels observed are much higher in sepsis and non-COVID ARDS than that in COVID-19, approaching 10,000 pg/ml in CRS and over 20,000 pg/ml in sepsis 110 . A recent meta-analysis revealed that IL-6 levels in severe COVID-19 were lower than patients with sepsis, septic shock or hyperinflammatory ARDS 125 . A study from the Netherlands further compared proinflammatory cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-8 and TNF) in critically ill patients with COVID-19 vs other critically ill individuals 111 . The concentrations of circulating cytokines were lower in patients with COVID-19 than in patients with bacterial sepsis and similar to other critically ill patients, even though patients with COVID-related ARDS had lower APACHE2 score, suggesting a lower severity of critical illness. These findings suggest, despite the initial enthusiasm, that COVID-19 may not be characterized by CSS and its role in the development of COVID-associated AKI therefore questionable. This has important implications for the rationale of using extracorporeal blood purification techniques as discussed further.

Angiotensin(1-7) generally opposes the actions of angiotensin-II.

        <p>Importantly, while in the kidney angiotensin(1-7) formation from angiotensin-II appears predominantly mediated by ACE2, both plasma angiotensin(1-7) and angiotensin(1-7) formation in the lungs have been reported to be largely independent of ACE2.

        <p>Altogether, these data suggest a specific interaction between ACE2 and angiotensin II in COVID-19. The interaction with the renin-angiotensin system may, however, depend on the severity of the disease where it represents an adaptative system to shock. Low levels of angiotensin-II may be associated with poorer outcome in critically ill patients. One small single center study among critically ill COVID-19 patients did show that AKI was associated with an increase in plasma renin levels 125 . This association between plasma renin levels and AKI was observed in other critical care settings such as distributive shock or cardiac surgery as the consequence a relative deficit of an angiotensin-II (inducing a loop positive feedback on renin release) 125,126 . This is suggested by lower angiotensin-II levels observed in COVID-19 patients with ARDS 127 .Altogether, these data suggest a specific interaction between ACE2 and angiotensin II in COVID-19.

        <p>The crosstalk between the cardiovascular system and kidneys is also likely to be a contributing to COVID-19 associated AKI. Rare cases of acute myocarditis 137,138 and myocardial injury 139 have been described in COVID-19 potentially resulting in impairment of cardiac function thereby potentially compromising kidney perfusion through decrease of cardiac output or renal vein congestion 140,141 . As in other forms of acute respiratory distress syndromes, use of high PEEP and/or tidal volumes leads to elevated intrathoracic pressure, increased right atrial pressure, increased right ventricular afterload and can decrease cardiac output 136 . Right heart dysfunction and increased venous pressures can result in increased interstitial and tubular hydrostatic pressure within the encapsulated kidney, which decreases net glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and oxygen delivery 142 .

        <p>There are uncertainties regarding the safety of antivirals used to treat COVID-19 in patients with AKI. Remdesivir is a nucleotide analog that inhibits viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and is predominantly renally excreted. Both efficacy and potential renal toxicity, through mitochondrial injury in renal tubular epithelial cells, have been proposed. Renal toxicity is most likely to occur after prolonged exposure or at high doses. A shorter recovery time from COVID-19 symptoms was reported in a randomized controlled trial of 1062 patients, a benefit mostly observed among patients treated early after onset of symptoms and not critically ill patients 148 . A decline in glomerular filtration rate was observed in 14% in the placebo group and 10% in the treated group, but patients with an eGFR of less than 30 ml/min were excluded thereby largely excluding patients with AKI. Of note, a more recently published randomized controlled trial failed to show a benefit of remdesivir on patient outcome 149 . Again, baseline eGFR was respectively 99 and 110 ml/min in the short (5 days) and extended duration (10 days) groups excluding patients with altered renal function at inclusion. A decline of creatinine clearance was seen in 30% of the control groups, 15%, in the short duration dose group and 26% in the extended duration dose group. Outside of clinical trials, some evidence of renal toxicity has however been identified. An analysis of the international pharmacovigilance post marketing databases of the World Health Organization revealed a statistically significant disproportionality signal of renal toxicity, with a 20-fold higher risk of AKI compared to other drugs frequently used in COVD-19 ( (hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, and lopinavir/ritonavir) 150 . Cases of AKI associated with lopinavir and low-dose ritonavir therapy in the course of COVID-19 management were also reported 151 . Finally, a potential nephrotoxic mechanism identified for other forms of AKI associated with viral infections is rhabdomyolysis, as described during the SARS-CoV2 pandemic 152,153 .There are uncertainties regarding the safety of antivirals used to treat COVID-19 in patients with AKI.

        <p>The question arises whether sepsis associated AKI and COVID-19 associated AKI share similarities. Sepsis associated AKI is characterized by a drop in GFR whereas renal blood flow might range from reduced to increased blood flow 156 . Contributing factors to sepsis-associated AKI include regional inflammation, microvascular alterations and hemodynamic alteration (including periglomerular shunting, activation of tubuloglomerular feedback, increased interstitial and, thus, intratubular pressure) 157,158 . Filtered DAMPs and PAMPs are considered triggers of interstitial inflammation by activating TLR2 and TLR4 receptors located on the brush border membrane of epithelial cells in the proximal tubule 159,160 . Additionally, glomerular leucocyte infiltration and intraglomerular thrombus formation are found indicating endothelial damage leading to increased permeability of the glomerulus (at least in animals) and albuminuria 161,162 . Inflammatory cytokines also have been shown to promote the release of ultralarge von Willebrand factor (ULVWF) multimers from endothelial cells and inhibit the cleavage and clearance of these pro-thrombotic agents by the metalloproteinase, ADAMTS13 162 . This, together with endothelial injury and shedding of the glycocalyx by inflammatory mediators may increase susceptibility to microthrombi formation, occlusion of glomerular and peritubular capillaries and prolonged exposure of tubular epithelial cells to inflammation and hypoxia.The question arises whether sepsis associated AKI and COVID-19 associated AKI share similarities.
