        <p>Increased intake of dietary carbohydrate that is fermented in the colon by the microbiota has been reported to decrease body weight, although the mechanism remains unclear. Here we use in vivo 11 C-acetate and PET-CT scanning to show that colonic acetate crosses the blood-brain barrier and is taken up by the brain. Intraperitoneal acetate results in appetite suppression and hypothalamic neuronal activation patterning. We also show that acetate administration is associated with activation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and changes in the expression profiles of regulatory neuropeptides that favour appetite suppression. Furthermore, we demonstrate through 13 C high-resolution magic-angle-spinning that 13 C acetate from fermentation of 13 C-labelled carbohydrate in the colon increases hypothalamic 13 C acetate above baseline levels. Hypothalamic 13 C acetate regionally increases the 13 C labelling of the glutamate-glutamine and GABA neuroglial cycles, with hypothalamic 13 C lactate reaching higher levels than the 'remaining brain'. These observations suggest that acetate has a direct role in central appetite regulation.Increased intake of dietary carbohydrate that is fermented in the colon by the microbiota has been reported to decrease body weight, although the mechanism remains unclear.

        <p>O besity has reached epidemic proportions worldwide, with incidence rates above 20% in most western countries now representing a major public health burden 1 . This rise in obesity is fuelled by the mismatch between an inherited genetic predisposition for survival in environments where food supply is limited and the current obesogenic environment where reduced physical activity and excess energy intake prevails 2 . Modern food processing has resulted in the mass production of cheap, energy-dense foods that are generally high in refined sugars and fats but low in fibre 3 . It has been estimated that the Palaeolithic diet delivered 4100 g per day of fibre, whereas current western intakes are only between 10 and 20 g per day 4 . Much of the fibre consumed in the Palaeolithic diet, unlike current fibre intake, would have been highly fermentable. There is a growing body of evidence that links fermentation of dietary carbohydrate (including fibre) by the colonic microbiota to positive effects on metabolism 5 . Observations by Cani et al. 6 demonstrated that rats exposed to a high-fat diet (HFD) with an increased fermentable carbohydrate (FC) component for 4 weeks had lower dietary energy intake, body weight and adiposity, suggesting that increased dietary FC leads to improved appetite and body weight regulation. FCs are thought to promote the release of the anorectic gut hormones peptide YY (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) (ref. 7). However, FC-associated weight loss in human and rodent models have failed to consistently show increases in these anorectic hormones 8 .O besity has reached epidemic proportions worldwide, with incidence rates above 20% in most western countries now representing a major public health burden 1 .

        <p>We have recently shown in mice that dietary FC supplementation is associated with reduced energy intake, body weight, adiposity and changes in hypothalamic neuronal activation patterns, all of which were independent of changes in circulating concentrations of GLP-1 (ref. 9). To better understand the mechanism behind the anorectic action of FC supplementation, we investigated the direct effects of the most abundant end product of colonic FC fermentation, the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) acetate, on the control of appetite.We have recently shown in mice that dietary FC supplementation is associated with reduced energy intake, body weight, adiposity and changes in hypothalamic neuronal activation patterns, all of which were independent of changes in circulating concentrations of GLP-1 (ref. 9).

        <p>We present herein that acetate derived from the colonic fermentation of FC acts to directly supress appetite through central hypothalamic mechanisms involving changes in transcellular neurotransmitter cycles.

        <p>The effect of FCs on body weight. We fed C57BL/6 mice with HFD supplemented with either the FC inulin (HF-I) or the poorly fermentable fibre cellulose (HF-C). After 8 weeks, mice fed the HF-I diet gained significantly less weight than those fed HF-C (Fig. 1a) and consumed significantly less food (Fig. 1b). SCFA analysis of the colonic content of the former animals demonstrated a significant increase in total SCFA concentrations and especially the most abundant SCFA, acetate (Fig. 1c). Although others have reported that FC supplementation leads to an increase in the anorectic hormones GLP-1 and PYY 6 , our group has recently reported that FC-rich diets increase manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) signal in the hypothalamus, a proxy of neuronal activation, via a mechanism that appears to be independent of changes in GLP-1 (ref. 9). In support of this, infusion of anorectic gut hormones have previously been shown to suppress hypothalamic MEMRI signal 10 , thereby suggesting that any increase in signal seen following FC supplementation is not PYY or GLP-1 dependent. We therefore hypothesized that there was a direct effect of SCFAs on appetite regulation, namely by acetate, given it is the most abundant SCFA produced in the colon, and that it partially avoids hepatic clearance to reach micromolar concentrations in the peripheral circulation.The effect of FCs on body weight.

        <p>The biodistribution of acetate and uptake in the brain. SCFA have traditionally been thought to be almost entirely metabolized by colonocytes and the liver 11 . However, acetate is present in the peripheral circulation, in human cerebrospinal fluid 12 as well as in the brain where it provides an important energy source for glial cells 13 . To our knowledge, there has been no previous publication investigating acetate as a potential appetite-regulating agent. We therefore sought to investigate the biodistribution of acetate administered peripherally or by administering it colonically to mimic the endogenous production from FC. To do this, we used in vivo intravenous (i.v.) and colonic infusions of 11 C-acetate and PET-CT in mice. A representative PET-CT image of a fasted mouse following i.v. 11 C-acetate infusion is shown in Fig. 1d. The liver and heart demonstrated the greatest proportion of initial 11 C-acetate dose uptake (Fig. 1f,g), but our data also show that up to 3% of the initial acetate tracer was taken up by the brain following i.v. infusions in both the fed and fasted states (Fig. 1e). Brain uptake following colonic infusion was more gradual, but it reached an equivalent level after B20 min.The biodistribution of acetate and uptake in the brain.

        <p>Acetate reduces acute food intake. We went on to test whether acetate was itself an anorectic signal using acute peripheral administration in C57BL/6 mice. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of acetate (500 mg kg À 1 ) produced an increase in serum acetate (Fig. 2a), similar to those that have been associated with suppression of free fatty acids 14 , which was associated with a significant reduction in acute food intake at both 1 and 2 h post injection (Fig. 2b). An acetate tolerance test demonstrated that there was no impact of i.p. acetate at 500 mg kg À 1 body weight on blood glucose concentrations (Fig. 2e). Acute behavioural observations post injection showed that this was also not associated with aversive behaviour (Fig. 2d). Furthermore, at 60 min post injection, there were no significant differences in circulating concentrations of plasma PYY and GLP-1 (Fig. 2g,h). We encapsulated acetate into liposomes 15 . Using this method of peripheral administration of liposome-encapsulated acetate over a 4-h period, we did not detect liposomes in the hypothalamus or changes in food intake (Fig. 2f). We therefore hypothesized that the anorectic effects of acetate may result from a direct effect on the central nervous system. We tested this hypothesis by administering 2.5 mmol of sodium acetate directly into the third ventricle of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) cannulated male Wistar rats. In accordance with the anorectic effects of peripherally administered acetate, central administration of acetate into the third ventricle suppressed food intake primarily at 1-2 h post injection, resulting in reduced cumulative food intake at both at 2 and 4 h (Fig. 2c), although this effect was not as potent as the suppression observed after i.p. administration of acetate in mice. The short-term suppressions of feeding were as expected given the rapid hepatic metabolism and short half-life of acetate.Acetate reduces acute food intake.

        <p>Having confirmed that acetate was an anorectic agent and was indeed taken up by the brain following colonic or i.v. administration, we next sought to confirm whether changes in hypothalamic neuronal activation that we had previously observed following dietary supplementation of FC 9 could be replicated following an acute administration of acetate. To achieve this, we again used the in vivo functional imaging technique MEMRI 9,10,16 . The regions of interest examined were as shown in Fig. 3a. Mice given an i.p. injection of an anorectic dose of acetate had a significant increase in signal intensity in the arcuate nucleus (ARC), indicative of increased neuronal activation, whereas no significant differences were observed in the ventral medial hypothalamus (VMH), the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) (Fig. 3b-d) or the brain stem (Fig. 3e). These data show an identical pattern to those seen when we fed mice a HFD supplemented with FC inulin 9 . We went on to investigate specific changes in hypothalamic neuropeptide expression following i.p. acetate administration. There was a four-fold rise in the expression of the melanocortin precursor pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and a potent suppression of agouti-related peptide (AgRP) expression 30 min after acetate administration (Fig. 3f). At 60 min, this suppression of AgRP remained. This disparate change in the expression patterns of anorectic and orexigenic neuropeptides favour a reduction in appetite and body weight, and have been previously reported by others feeding rodents FC-rich diets 17 .Having confirmed that acetate was an anorectic agent and was indeed taken up by the brain following colonic or i.v. administration, we next sought to confirm whether changes in hypothalamic neuronal activation that we had previously observed following dietary supplementation of FC 9 could be replicated following an acute administration of acetate.

        <p>Acetate reduces hypothalamic AMPK catalytic activity. Mammalian neuronal tissue is thought to rapidly convert acetate to acetyl-CoA, which then enters the Krebs cycle 13 . Accumulating evidence suggests that hypothalamic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has an important role in energy and nutrient sensing 18 . Phosphorylation of threonine 172 (T172) within the alpha subunit of AMPK directly activates the kinase, which in turn phosphorylates and inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), leading to decreased levels of malonyl-CoA. Studies have shown that increased hypothalamic malonyl-CoA concentrations are associated with an increase in the expression of POMC 19 and suppression of Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and AgRP with a subsequent reduction in rodent food intake. Thus, we hypothesized that acetate administration may mediate the changes in appetite we had observed and also more specifically changes in POMC and AgRP expression.

No significant differences, when compared by GEE and Mann-Whitney U-test, were observed between i.v. administrations in the fed or fasted state, but there is a slower increase when the 11 C-acetate was colonically infused (Po0.001; n ¼ 3-4 per group).Acetate reduces hypothalamic AMPK catalytic activity.

        <p>surrogate of their activities. We found a significant reduction in levels of pT172 of AMPK and pS79 of ACC (Fig. 3g-i), suggesting that acute acetate administration inactivated AMPK, thereby leading to increased ACC activity. Increased ACC activity has been shown to elevate malonyl-CoA that can stimulate expression of POMC and cocaine-and amphetamine-regulated transcript and decrease NPY and AgRP leading to a reduction in food intake 19 . This therefore suggests that the anorectic effects of acetate administration are mediated through a change in hypothalamic ACC and AMPK activities and downstream changes in neuropeptide expression. A schematic illustration of this relationship is shown in Fig. 3j. There was no significant effect on either peptide as determined by two-sided, unpaired, Student's t-test. 13 C acetate preferentially accumulates in the hypothalamus.surrogate of their activities.

        <p>Given the aforementioned changes in neuronal activation and neuropeptides expression, we sought to determine the hypothalamic metabolism of acetate using 13 C high-resolution magicangle-spinning (HR-MAS). Figure 4 summarizes the results on hypothalamic metabolism of i.p. (2-13 C) acetate or 13 C 2 acetate derived from colonic fermentation of (U-13 C) inulin administered by gavage. 1 H-decoupled 13 C HR-MAS spectra of cerebral biopsies provide information on the operation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and the transcellular glutamate-glutamine and g-amino butyric acid (GABA) cycles 20,21 . Here we implemented the 13 C HR-MAS approach to investigate the metabolism of labelled [2- 13 C] acetate or 13 C 2 acetate in the hypothalamus of fasted mice as well as in biopsies from the 'remaining brain' obtained for comparison. To this end, brain metabolism was arrested with focused microwaves immediately after (0 min) or 15 and 30 min later, following the i.p. administration of (2-13 C) acetate or 180 min after intragastric (U-13 C) inulin administrations, and a biopsy of the hypothalamus surgically separated from the remaining brain, investigating 13 C labelling in both samples. Figure 4a 13 C incorporation from these substrates in acetate C2, glutamate and glutamine C4, GABA C2 and lactate C3 carbons in the hypothalamus biopsy (light grey), as well as in the remaining brain biopsy (dark grey).

        <p>In addition, the 13 C resonances of Glu C4, Gln C4 and GABA C2 also increased significantly with time both in intra-and extrahypothalamic structures, supporting substantial metabolism of accumulated 13 C acetate in the cerebral TCA cycle and neuroglial glutamate-glutamine or GABA transcellular cycles (Fig. 4c). To investigate whether the concentrations of acetate derived from fermentation in the colon would be sufficiently high to unambiguously label these metabolites in the hypothalamus (and trigger the anorectic responses described), we used (U-13 C) inulin. Interestingly, 13 C accumulation in these metabolites from intragastric (U-13 C) inulin was often higher than from i.p. (2-13 C) acetate, revealing an efficient fermentation of the inulin in the mouse colon at a level that directly influences hypothalamic metabolism. 13 C 2 acetate from U- 13 C inulin labelled faster Glu C4, Gln C4 and GABA C2 in the hypothalamus than in the rest of the brain. In fact, no detectable 13 C incorporations in GABA C2 or Gln C4 could be found in the remaining brain biopsies, even when 13 C incorporation into the common Glu C4 precursor was similar in both regions. We believe that this is the result of the preferential incorporation of 13 C 2 acetate and its metabolism in the hypothalamus as compared with the remaining brain, suggesting that Gln C4 and GABA C2 labelling in non-hypothalamic structures would occur at later times.In addition, the 13 C resonances of Glu C4, Gln C4 and GABA C2 also increased significantly with time both in intra-and extrahypothalamic structures, supporting substantial metabolism of accumulated 13 C acetate in the cerebral TCA cycle and neuroglial glutamate-glutamine or GABA transcellular cycles (Fig. 4c).

        <p>Notably, 13 C GABA and 13 C lactate remained at a similar level until 30 min when both 13 C GABA and 13 C lactate were higher in the hypothalamus than in the remaining brain biopsies, indicating a relative increase in gabaergic neurotransmission and oxidative 13 C lactate production from the pyruvate recycling pathway in the mouse hypothalamus under appetite stimulation 22 . (2-13 C) or 13 C 2 acetate are also oxidatively recycled in the neuronal cycle, originating the Lac C3 resonance. The glutamate-glutamine and GABA cycles support glutamatergic and gabaergic neurotransmissions, the two fundamental synaptic events triggering increased Ca 2 þ uptake and competitive Mn 2 þ uptake (MEMRI) that determine the appetite impulse.Notably, 13 C GABA and 13 C lactate remained at a similar level until 30 min when both 13 C GABA and 13 C lactate were higher in the hypothalamus than in the remaining brain biopsies, indicating a relative increase in gabaergic neurotransmission and oxidative 13 C lactate production from the pyruvate recycling pathway in the mouse hypothalamus under appetite stimulation 22 .

        <p>In order to evaluate the contribution of potential variations in total metabolite content to the 13 C incorporation profiles, we acquired 1 H HR-MAS spectra for the same biopsies we used for the 13 C HR-MAS acquisitions, as the resonances detected by 1 H HR-MAS are known to reveal the total metabolite content. Figure 5a, shows a representative 1 H HR-MAS spectrum from a biopsy obtained from the hypothalamus, 180 min after (U-13 C) inulin administration (black trace), with some of the most relevant metabolite resonances highlighted and the corresponding LCModel fitting superimposed (red trace). We calculated the metabolite ratios for acetate, GABA, glutamate, glutamine and lactate using the total myo-inositol or the total creatine (Cr þ PCr) resonances as internal references. Our results revealed that the significantly higher 13 C incorporations in hypothalamic acetate C2, GABA C2, glutamate and glutamine C4 and Lac C3 are primarily derived from the 13 C-labelled substrates administered rather than from relative changes in total metabolite content (Fig. 5b-f). Notably, similar levels of total glutamine and total GABA were found in the hypothalamus and remaining brain biopsies 180 min after (U-13 C) inulin administration (Fig. 5c,d). confirming that the higher 13 C incorporations detected in hypothalamic Gln C4 and GABA C2, are not derived from relative changes in the total metabolite levels between these two regions. Similar conclusions were obtained when using the total creatine (Cr þ PCr) resonance as internal reference for the total metabolite content. This normalization allowed, however, for the comparison between the myo-inositol content in the hypothalamus and the remaining brain. No significant differences in Ino/(Cr þ PCr) ratios were found between both regions, 15 or 30 min after (2-13 C) acetate, or 180 min after (U-13 C) inulin administrations. These results suggest that previously reported differences in myo-inositol content between the untreated mouse hypothalamus and hipoccampus 23 do not contribute appreciably to the present comparisons between the hypothalamus and remaining brain biopsies after (2-13 C) acetate or (U-13 C) inulin administrations.In order to evaluate the contribution of potential variations in total metabolite content to the 13 C incorporation profiles, we acquired 1 H HR-MAS spectra for the same biopsies we used for the 13 C HR-MAS acquisitions, as the resonances detected by 1 H HR-MAS are known to reveal the total metabolite content. Figure 5a, shows a representative 1 H HR-MAS spectrum from a biopsy obtained from the hypothalamus, 180 min after (U-13 C) inulin administration (black trace), with some of the most relevant metabolite resonances highlighted and the corresponding LCModel fitting superimposed (red trace). We calculated the metabolite ratios for acetate, GABA, glutamate, glutamine and lactate using the total myo-inositol or the total creatine (Cr þ PCr) resonances as internal references. Our results revealed that the significantly higher 13 C incorporations in hypothalamic acetate C2, GABA C2, glutamate and glutamine C4 and Lac C3 are primarily derived from the 13 C-labelled substrates administered rather than from relative changes in total metabolite content (Fig. 5b-f). Notably, similar levels of total glutamine and total GABA were found in the hypothalamus and remaining brain biopsies 180 min after (U-13 C) inulin administration (Fig. 5c,d). confirming that the higher 13 C incorporations detected in hypothalamic Gln C4 and GABA C2, are not derived from relative changes in the total metabolite levels between these two regions.

        <p>Summarizing, we conclude then that the neuronal activation in the ARC observed in Fig. 3b using MEMRI occurs because of a relative increase in acetate and glutamatergic or gabaergic neurotransmissions in the hypothalamus that would result in divalent ion uptake, in this case Mn 2 þ , and therefore an increase in MEMRI signal intensity as shown in our summary schematic (Fig. 4c).Summarizing, we conclude then that the neuronal activation in the ARC observed in Fig. 3b using MEMRI occurs because of a relative increase in acetate and glutamatergic or gabaergic neurotransmissions in the hypothalamus that would result in divalent ion uptake, in this case Mn 2 þ , and therefore an increase in MEMRI signal intensity as shown in our summary schematic (Fig. 4c).</p>
        <p>In this paper, we provide a novel insight into the mechanism behind the well-established observation that animals fed a HFD supplemented with FC have decreased energy intake and weight gain 24,25 . Most of the work in this area investigating the mechanism underlying these observations has previously focused on the potential effect of FC to promote the release of the anorectic gut hormones PYY and GLP-1 (ref. 6). However, increased concentrations of these hormones have been difficult to reproduce in humans 26 . In previous studies from our group, we have observed that decreased food intake and diminished body weight can occur independently of change in gut hormones in mice 9,24 . We also observed an increase in MEMRI signal in the hypothalamic ARC, with no associated increase in signal intensity in the brain stem, the opposite to that observed following administration of the anorectic gut hormones GLP-1 and PYY 27 .In this paper, we provide a novel insight into the mechanism behind the well-established observation that animals fed a HFD supplemented with FC have decreased energy intake and weight gain 24,25 .

        <p>Here we have demonstrated that the decrease in body weight observed in FC supplementation studies appears to be mediated, at least in part, by the SCFA acetate. Acute i.p. injection of acetate decreased energy intake over 2 h without effecting behaviour and occurred independently of changes in the peripheral concentrations of GLP-1 and PYY. It is of interest that encapsulation of acetate into liposomes, which specifically allows for peripheral delivery, abolishes the anorectic effect of acetate in mice, whereas i.c.v. administration of acetate in rats, although still anorectic, shows a milder and more delayed suppression of food intake. The lack of brain-stem-induced changes in signal intensity following i.p. acetate do not suggest a vagally mediated effect of acetate, and thus the difference in potency may be because of species variation. We also demonstrate that appetite changes are unlikely to be because of change in the availability of glucose to the hypothalamus, as acetate did not affect circulating glucose concentrations. We have also shown that acetate administered through both i.v. and colonic routes is taken up by the brain and for the first time that acetate derived from fermentation of carbohydrate in the colon is taken up by the hypothalamus in greater amounts than other brain tissue. MEMRI signal intensity patterning following acetate infusion also directly reflects that of animals fed with FC 9 . Furthermore, we have shown that peripheral acetate administration leads to increased POMC and reduced AgRP expression in the hypothalamus, suggesting that acetate has a direct effect on the hypothalamic control of appetite. Similar observations have been made when animals are fed with FC 17 . Changes in the phosphorylation of key residues of AMPK and ACC in mouse hypothalamic lysates following peripheral acetate administration also provides evidence of a potential mechanism through which the changes in neuropeptide expression might occur. Given that acetate is taken up by the hypothalamus, where it is preferentially metabolized by astrocytes because of the higher activity of their monocarboxylate transporters compared with neurons 28,29 , a non-neuronal mechanism may also be implicated in the observed increase in ARC activation. Using 13 C HR-MAS in whole hypothalamic tissue, we were able to demonstrate that 13 C acetate from both i.p. injections and derived from colonic fermentation incorporates into the glutamate-glutamine transcellular cycle, increasing lactate and GABA labelling, thus supporting hypothalamic glutamatergic or gabaergic neurotransmissions. The same model has been proposed to occur in acetate metabolism following alcohol ingestion 30 . The operation of the glutamine cycle involves imperative signalling through ionotropic and metabotropic postsynaptic glutamate receptors, resulting in increased intracellular Ca 2 þ accumulation 22 and a concomitant MEMRI effect 31 (Fig. 4c). It has recently been demonstrated that leptin modulates glutamate transporter expression in hypothalamic astrocytes with an associated increase in POMC neuron excitability 32 . A similar mechanism could take place following acetate administration, potentially explaining the increase in MEMRI signal observed in ARC of animals supplemented with FC or given acetate alone. We hypothesize that the increase in hypothalamic 13 C acetate over time, as compared with rest of the brain, results in increased hypothalamic gabaergic neurotransmission and oxidative lactate production from the pyruvate recycling pathway 22 . Increased oxidative metabolism results in increased ATP production, decreasing the AMP:ATP ratio, and thereby decreasing AMPK activity and consequently reducing the inhibition of ACC. This produces an increase in malonyl-CoA, stimulates POMC neurons and predominantly gabaergic neurotransmission, thus decreasing the appetite impulse 33 .Here we have demonstrated that the decrease in body weight observed in FC supplementation studies appears to be mediated, at least in part, by the SCFA acetate.

        <p>Dietary intakes of fibre in excess of 100 g per day consumed by Palaeolithic man and in some hunter gather tribes 4 suggest the human colon is adapted to large intakes of fermentable material that would lead to high-peripheral circulating acetate 34 . The fall in fibre intakes or, more specifically, a decline in the intake of carbohydrates that can be readily fermented in the colon are one such factor that seems to be an inverse correlate of obesity prevalence. Although studies have suggested that the inclusion of highly FC diets may be beneficial in terms of regulation of both appetite and body weight, in free-living individuals, compliance to such eating regimens is often low due to gastrointestinal side effects or unpalatability of FC-rich foodstuffs. The work highlighted within the paper suggests that the SCFA acetate may at least in part mediate some of the obesity-protective effects of FC-rich diets directly in the central nervous system, thus suggesting that acetate may be useful as a potential anti-obesity therapeutic. This hypothesis does not rule out that there are other non-specific effects.Dietary intakes of fibre in excess of 100 g per day consumed by Palaeolithic man and in some hunter gather tribes 4 suggest the human colon is adapted to large intakes of fermentable material that would lead to high-peripheral circulating acetate 34 .

        <p>In conclusion, here we provide novel insight into a mechanism through which FC may mediate appetite suppression. By exploring the role of the SCFA acetate, a product of fermentation of carbohydrate in the colon, our evidence suggests that acetate derived from the colon induces an anorectic signal in the hypothalamic ARC by supporting the glutamate-glutamine transcellular cycle and leading to an increase in lactate and GABA production. These data demonstrate a previously unexplored central mechanism through which the fermentation products of FC and dietary fibre may aid in the control of body weight beyond that of energy dilution and gut hormone release. Moreover, it opens up important new possibilities for weight management as the supply of fermentable substrate to the colon (and therefore acetate production) can be modified.In conclusion, here we provide novel insight into a mechanism through which FC may mediate appetite suppression.

        <p>Determination of acetate concentrations in serum and faeces. SCFAs were determined by gas chromatography in the colonic contents and serum of mice that where freshly culled. The method used was adapted from Richardson et al. 35 Briefly, caecal contents were weighed (20-220 mg) and combined with 550 ml of PBS. Samples were vortex mixed for 1 min, centrifuged at 3,000 g for 10 min and the supernatant was collected. To 500 ml supernatant, 25 ml of internal standard and 2-ethylbutyric acid was added to give a final concentration of 5 mmol l À 1 . Acids were extracted by the addition of 250 ml concentrated hydrochloric acid and 1 ml diethyl ether followed by vortex mixing for 1 min. Samples were centri- fuged for 10 min at 3,000 g and the ether layer was removed and transferred to a separate capped vial. N-methyl-N-t-butyldimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA; Sigma) was added (100 ml) before heating at 80 °C for 20 min. Gas chromatography was performed on a Hewlett Packard 5890 Series II instrument equipped with a flame ionization detector, split/splitless injector and a 10-m, 0.18 mm ID and 0.20 mm df Rtx-1 (Crossbond 100% dimethyl polysiloxane, Thames Restek UK, Ltd) capillary column. Injector and detector temperatures were 275 o C with the column temperature programmed from 63 °C for 3 min to 190 o C at 10 °C per min. Helium served as the carrier gas (head pressure 135 kPa) and injections (1 ml) were made in the split mode (50:1 split). Peak areas were recorded and all subsequent data manipulation was completed using

        <p>Serum SCFA measurement. A 100-500-ml aliquot of serum was filtered through a 30-kDa micropartition system (Vivaspin RC VS02H22 filters, Sartorius Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada) by centrifugation at 14,000 g at 4 °C for 90 min. An internal standard solution (25 ml) consisting of 100 mM ethylbutyrate and 100 mM formic acid was added to 225 ml of the protein-free filtrate supernatant in a 2-ml Hichrom vial (Agilent Technologies, South Queensferry, UK). To measure SCFA, 1 ml of each sample was injected into a 5,890 Series II GC system (HP, Crawley, UK) fitted with a NukolTM Capilllary Column (30 m Â 0.53 mm Â 1.0 mm, SUPELCOTM Analytical, UK) and flame ionization detector. The carrier gas, helium, was delivered at a flow rate of 14 ml min À 1 . The head pressure was set at 10 p.s.i. with split injection. Run conditions were: initial temperature 60 °C, 1 min; þ 20 °C min À 1 to 145 °C; þ 4 °C min À 1 to 200 °C, hold 25 min. Peaks were integrated using

The CT scan was used for anatomical data and attenuation correction purposes. The PET system consisted of 64 lutetium oxyothosilicate based detectors blocks arranged in four contiguous rings, with a crystal ring diameter of 16.1 cm and an axial extent of 12.7 cm. Each detector block was composed of a 20 Â 20 array of lutetium oxyothosilicate crystals coupled to a position sensitive photomultiplier tube via a light guide.

        <p>The effect of acetate on hypothalamic metabolism. [2-13 C] acetate (500 mg kg À 1 ) or [U- 13 C] inulin (100 mg) were administrated to 8-10-week-old C57BL/6J male mice (Charles River, Spain) after an overnight fasting (16 h) either with i.p. (n ¼ 18) or by gavage (n ¼ 4), respectively. All mice were anaesthetized with 4% isoflurane (3 l per min, 99% oxygen), and cerebral metabolism was arrested within 1.5 s using a high-power (5 kW) microwave fixation system (TMW-6402C, Muromachi Kikai Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) immediately (0 min), 15 and 30 min after acetate, or 180 min after inulin, administrations. Fixed brains were dissected and hypothalamus and remaining brain biopsies were obtained and maintained frozen ( À 80 °C) until HR-MAS analyses. 13 C (125,03 MHz) and 1 H HR-MAS (500,13 MHz) spectra were acquired at 11.7 T (4 °C, 4,000 Hz rotation) with a Bruker AVANCE wide bore spectrometer equipped with a MAS accessory (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany). 1 H-decoupled 13 C HR-MAS spectra were acquired using a pulse-acquire sequence, with WALTZ-16 1 H decoupling applied during the acquisition and relaxation delay periods. Conditions were p/4 pulses, 8,192 or 16,384 scans (for [2-13 C] acetate or [U- 13 C] inulin measurements, respectively), 64 k data points, 5 s recycle delay. The 13 C spectra were processed with

            <rs type="url">http://mestrelab.com/)</rs>. Chemical shifts of the 13 C resonances were referred to the acetate C2 resonance (24.5 p.p.m.), and the 13 C incorporation was normalized to the myo-inositol C1 þ C3 resonance (73.2 p.p.m.), which provides a useful internal reference from which all 13 C resonances can be normalized independently of the amount of tissue 20,47 , introducing appropriate corrections for nuclear Overhausser enhancement and saturation.

Non-normally distributed data was log transformed to normalize the distribution. Comparison between groups was carried out by two-sided unpaired Student's t-test for two groups and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc Tukey or Bonferroni correction if there were more than two groups. I.c.v. cross-over acetate injection studies were compared using a two-sided paired Student's t-test. Given the cumulative nature of both MEMRI and PET signal intensity data, differences in signal intensity profile between the regions of interest in all experimental groups were analysed using GEE and the Mann-Whitney U-test with commercial statistical software (
