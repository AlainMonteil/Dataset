        <p>Inflammation is a comprehensive array of physiological response to a foreign organism, including human pathogens, dust particles, and viruses. Inflammations are mainly divided into acute and chronic inflammation depending on various inflammatory processes and cellular mechanisms. Recent investigations have clarified that inflammation is a major factor for the progression of various chronic diseases/disorders, including diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, eye disorders, arthritis, obesity, autoimmune diseases, and inflammatory bowel disease. Free radical productions from different biological and environmental sources are due to an imbalance of natural antioxidants which further leads to various inflammatory associated diseases. In this review article, we have outlined the inflammatory process and its cellular mechanisms involved in the progression of various chronic modern human diseases. In addition, we have discussed the role of free radicals-induced tissue damage, antioxidant defence, and molecular mechanisms in chronic inflammatory diseases/disorders. The systematic knowledge regarding the role of inflammation and its associated adverse effects can provide a clear understanding in the development of innovative therapeutic targets from natural sources that are intended for suppression of various chronic inflammations associated diseases.Inflammation is a comprehensive array of physiological response to a foreign organism, including human pathogens, dust particles, and viruses.

        <p>In the early nineteenth century, inflammation has become one of the most serious and interesting investigation research areas among biomedical researchers. The microcirculation is the main playground where the process of inflammatory cascade was evaluated and analyzed [1]. Inflammation includes a long chain of molecular reactions and cellular activity, which are designed to restore a tissue from simple skin cut or to repair tissue after giving birth or to cure several burn injuries. An inflammatory process in cellular and tissue levels includes a series of occasions with dilation of venules and arterioles, enhanced blood vessel permeability, and blood flow with percolation of leukocytes into the tissues [2]. Moreover, a dysfunction of tissue via proteolytic activity and regeneration of new humoral production for cell growth and reformation of novel functional and connective tissue are observed through a typical inflammatory response [1]. An inflammation cascade, which does not reach to resolution state, contributes to organ disorder and death. The inflammatory cascade is preprogrammed and stereotyped, and it is the only identified mechanism for restoration of tissue after injury. In the recent years, inflammation is one of the major target research areas among biomedical researchers, which includes various cellular processes (e.g., phagocytosis, chemotaxis, mitosis, and cell differentiation) [1]. There are several studies described on how the immune system (cellular immunity and antibodies) leads to an inflammatory response, and there is an additional huge clinical literature about individual steps in inflammation [1,3].In the early nineteenth century, inflammation has become one of the most serious and interesting investigation research areas among biomedical researchers.

        <p>Stages of inflammation depend on the duration of the process as well as various immune factors and inflammation has been classified into two different classes which are acute and chronic processes (Figure 1).Stages of inflammation depend on the duration of the process as well as various immune factors and inflammation has been classified into two different classes which are acute and chronic processes (Figure 1).</p>
        <p>Acute inflammation is a short procedure, lasting from minutes to a few days, and its major features are leakage of plasma proteins or fluid and movement of leukocytes into an extravascular area [3]. These cellular and vascular reactions are intermediated by chemical factors produced from cells or plasma and are responsible for the classic clinical symptoms of inflammation such as swelling, redness, pain, warmth, and loss of function. Even though an inflammatory response can happen in any injurious stimulus, the characteristic of this process is the reaction of vascularized connective tissue [3]. There are three main steps in acute inflammatory responses which include enhanced blood flow to inflame area, followed by vasodilatation and enhanced vascular permeability with leakage of plasma from the microcirculation, and phagocytic leukocyte migration to the surrounding tissue [1,3,4] (Figure 2).Acute inflammation is a short procedure, lasting from minutes to a few days, and its major features are leakage of plasma proteins or fluid and movement of leukocytes into an extravascular area [3].

        <p>The first alterations noticed during inflammation are changes in the vascular flow and alterations in the caliber of small blood vessels. Newly generated capillary vessels and larger arterioles enhance the blood flow to this region. Progressive alterations in the endothelium boost the vascular permeability of the microvasculature, causing an escape of the fluid into an extravascular area which acquires the process to the next step [3]. The reduced volume of fluid in the lumen of blood vessels improves the viscosity of the blood and decreases the flow rate. Finally, after these changes in blood circulation, the margination of leukocytes begins and leukocytes adhere to the endothelium, at first, by rolling and then adhesion. Subsequently, they move through the vascular wall (transmigration) into the interstitial tissue. At this stage, the crucial purpose of acute inflammation, which is supplying leukocytes and plasma mediators to the injured area, is obtained [3,4].The first alterations noticed during inflammation are changes in the vascular flow and alterations in the caliber of small blood vessels.

        <p>Based on the type of infection (bacteria, virus, parasite, etc.) the sensors, mediators, and target tissues are differed during inflammatory response [5]. For example, bacterial pathogens are recognized via receptors of the innate immune system like Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that are expressed in tissue-resident macrophages and stimulate the generation of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-𝛼, IL-1𝛽, and IL-6), chemokines (e.g., chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 and chemokine CXC motif ligand 8), and PGE2 [6]. These inflammatory productions then react on target tissues which include local blood vessels to stimulate vasodilation, extravasation of neutrophils, and leakage of plasma into the infected site (acute inflammation). Then, neutrophils tissue-resident macrophages and mast cells find the pathogens to eliminate them. This process is assisted by components of plasma and initiated by antibodies and its components. Classical pathway of complement is initiated by producing antibodies by natural antibodies, C-reactive protein, or serum amyloid protein [5]. Basically, microbes activate the classical pathway of complement through binding to C1q or mannose-binding lectin. Then, for the generation of the C3 convertase in classical pathway C2 and C4 components are required. C3 convertases cleave C3 to C3a and C3b and C3b then leads to the formation of the C5 convertase which generates C5a and C5b. Following that, C5b suppressed the production of C5b-9 terminal complement complex and then incorporated into bacterial cell walls and lysed them [3,6].Based on the type of infection (bacteria, virus, parasite, etc.) the sensors, mediators, and target tissues are differed during inflammatory response [5].

        <p>These extremely powerful mediators and effectors do not discriminate among microbial and host targets; thus, harm to host tissues is inescapable [7,8]. An effective acute inflammatory reaction results in the removal of infectious factors followed by a repair and resolution stage that is mediated via tissue-resident macrophages [9]. The shift in lipid markers from proinflammatory prostaglandins to lipoxins, which have anti-inflammatory effects, is vital for the changes from inflammation to resolution. In this stage, lipoxins decrease the role of neutrophils and, alternatively, activate the role of monocytes, which eliminate dead cells and trigger tissue remodeling. Protectins and resolvins which constitute another class of lipid marker in addition to TGF-𝛽 and other growth factors generated from macrophages also have a vital role in the resolution of inflammation including the foundation of tissue repair [9,10].These extremely powerful mediators and effectors do not discriminate among microbial and host targets; thus, harm to host tissues is inescapable [7,8].

        <p>Inflammation is a vital response of human immune system. Nevertheless, the state of chronic inflammation can have several secondary consequences in biological response associated with enhanced risk of chronic diseases and disorders. Chronic inflammation in tissue usually happens when inflammatory responses are in the absence of an actual stimulus. It usually occurs through infections that are not resolved either within endogenous protection mechanisms or via some other resistance mechanism from host defences [11]. They can also happen from physical or chemical agents, which cannot be broken down, as well as from some kind of genetic susceptibility. Persistence of foreign bodies, continuous chemical exposures, recurrent acute inflammation, or specific pathogens are all crucial reasons for chronic inflammation [12] (Figure 3).Inflammation is a vital response of human immune system.

        <p>Molecular and cellular process of chronic inflammation is varied and depends on the type of inflamed cells and organ [13]. For example, in Western countries, chronic liver disease (CLD) mainly is related to chronic hepatitis B, hepatitis C infection, metabolic disease, alcohol consumption, drug/toxin-induced liver injury, and/or autoimmune causes, which include immune-mediated biliary disease. Hence, CLD is an important public health burden and is a main cause of worldwide morbidity and mortality [14]. Hepatic inflammation is one of the common types of liver illnesses and is known as the major driver of hepatic tissue damage contributing to fibrogenesis and hepatocellular carcinoma [15]. The inflammatory response throughout CLD can lead to innate immune system, which is the initial step of the body immune system toward invading pathogens and is vital for the overall survival of the host body. Liver innate immune cells include Kupffer cells, neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, natural killer T cells, and natural killer cells and initiate and maintain hepatic inflammation through cytokine generation [16]. An unregulated cytokine production balance after liver injury can lead to hepatocytes cell death, which is a key discovery in several acute and chronic liver illnesses [17]. Inflammatory process which is too strong or fails to reach to resolution stage will become chronic and it will lead to the loss of the large amount of hepatocytes, leading to liver parenchyma damage [18]. Since myofibroblast can regenerate from hepatic stem cells, which can be replaced by dead hepatocytes, this can lead to an unresolved inflammatory response that can stimulate fibrotic/cirrhotic which can be distinguished through an irreversible decrease in liver function test [19]. A usual molecular feature of hepatitis is presence of damage of liver tissue and inflammatory cells.Molecular and cellular process of chronic inflammation is varied and depends on the type of inflamed cells and organ [13].

        <p>Inflammation exists in patients with infections, environmental diseases (asbestos exposure and smoke inhalation, etc.), immune diseases, and chronic diseases like diabetes, gout, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, and so forth. Nowadays, it has also been evident that a variety of illnesses have shown inflammatory response such as venous and chronic arterial diseases [20][21][22], myocardial ischemia [23,24], Alzheimer's disease, acute cerebral stroke [22], cancer, and arterial hypertension [25]. Since many decades ago, there are also a diversity of clinical observations and molecular data for inflammation in osteoarthritis [26,27]. In addition, there are some indicators of inflammation in highly depressed patients [28]. to obesity [29,30] and insufficient typical physical exercise [31]. Currently, inflammation has become a vital topic for the study of human illness. Anti-inflammatory compounds, which have proven to be useful in one particular disease, could possibly turn out to be useful in another disease. Interestingly, it could open a huge range of possibilities for intervention in utilizing anti-inflammatory compounds [1] (Figure 4).Inflammation exists in patients with infections, environmental diseases (asbestos exposure and smoke inhalation, etc.), immune diseases, and chronic diseases like diabetes, gout, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, and so forth.

        <p>4.1. Free Radicals. A free radical is a molecule or atom that carries one or more unpaired electrons and is able to exist independently [32]. Meanwhile, free radicals have an odd number of electrons; this makes them short lived, highly reactive, and unstable. Consequently, it can react quickly with other substances trying to catch the required electron to obtain stability. Free radical can become balanced by attacking the closest stable molecule and "stealing" its electron. Meanwhile the attacked molecule can become a free radical by losing its electron and start a chain reaction cascade causing damage to the living cell [33]. Examples of free radicals are hydroxyl free radical, superoxide free radical anion, lipid peroxyl, lipid peroxide, and lipid alkoxyl.4.1. Free Radicals.

        <p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are radical derivatives such as singlet oxygen and hydrogen peroxide [32,33] (Table 1). Normal cellular metabolism produces ROS and these play crucial roles in activation of signaling pathways in animal and plant cells which alter the intra-and extracellular metabolism. Almost most of the ROS are produced in cells through the mitochondrial respiratory chain [32,33]. During endogenous metabolic reactions, aerobic cells generate ROS (e.g., superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), and hydroxyl radical and organic peroxides) as the usual products of biological diminution of molecular oxygen. Within hypoxic situation, the mitochondrial respiratory chain also generates nitric oxide (NO), which can produce other reactive nitrogen species (RNS) [32]. RNS can produce other additional reactive species, for example, reactive aldehydes-malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal, by inducing excessive lipid peroxidation. Lipids and proteins are important targets for oxidative attack and alteration of these molecules can enhance the mutagenesis process [34,35].Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are radical derivatives such as singlet oxygen and hydrogen peroxide [32,33] (Table 1).

        <p>In inflammatory response, leukocytes and mast cells are present in the damage regions which direct to a "respiratory burst" as a result of an enhanced uptake of oxygen and therefore enhance the production and release of ROS at the damaged area [34,35]. However, inflammatory cells generate more soluble inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, arachidonic acid, and chemokines, which act through active inflammatory cells in the area of infection and release more reactive species. These essential markers can stimulate signal transduction cascades in addition to alterations in transcription factors, like nuclear factor kappa B (NF-𝜅B), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, activator protein-1, NF-E2 related factor-2, nuclear factor of activated T cells, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1𝛼 (HIF1-𝛼), which mediate vital cellular stress reactions. Initiation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducibility of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and high expression of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-𝛼 (TNF-𝛼), interleukin-1𝛽 (IL-1𝛽), IL-6, and chemokines (CXC chemokine receptor 4), in addition to changes in the expression of specific microRNAs, have also been exhibited to have a role in oxidative stress-induced inflammation [36,37]. This inflammatory/oxidative environment triggers an unhealthy circle, which can harm healthy stromal cells and neighboring epithelial cells, which after a long period of time may trigger carcinogenesis [33,36].In inflammatory response, leukocytes and mast cells are present in the damage regions which direct to a "respiratory burst" as a result of an enhanced uptake of oxygen and therefore enhance the production and release of ROS at the damaged area [34,35].

        <p>In normal and healthy body condition, there is a balance between reactive oxygen species formation/free radical and endogenous antioxidant defence mechanisms. However, if this equilibrium is disturbed, it can lead to oxidative stress and associated damage. This oxidative stress condition can cause injury to all vital cellular components such as DNA, proteins, and membrane lipids and it may lead to cell death [38]. As a result, it can cause numerous diseases which include diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, inflammation, cancer, degenerative diseases, ischemia, and anemia [39] (Figure 5).In normal and healthy body condition, there is a balance between reactive oxygen species formation/free radical and endogenous antioxidant defence mechanisms.

        <p>Anti-Inflammatory Agents. The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that 80% of the world inhabitants utilized traditional medicine for their primary health care needs and the majority of this therapy requires the use of herbal extracts and their active components. Various medicinal plant bioactive extracts and their identified/isolated active constituents have shown a variety of medicinal pharmacological properties against various acute and chronic diseases/disorders [40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48][49]. Currently, the impact of oxidative stress and its associated factors has become an important issue of human health [50]. When the body is under a lot of stress, the production of ROS (e.g., hydroxyl radicals, superoxide anion radicals, and hydrogen peroxide) is amplified [51]. Endogenous enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant substance are not able to handle the overload of ROS and lead to imbalances of the process, cell damage [52], and health problems [53]. Lack of antioxidant compounds in daily diet can lead to the development of degenerative diseases [50] such as cancers, cardiovascular diseases [51], Alzheimer's disease, neurodegenerative diseases [54], and various inflammatory illnesses. Incorporation of antioxidant compounds by consuming natural plant sources in the daily diet can be a suitable solution to solve human health issues. These natural antioxidant sources can be used as a preventive medicine. Recent investigation suggested that there is an inverse link between the dietary consumption of antioxidantrich foods and prevalence of human illness [50].Anti-Inflammatory Agents.

        <p>Numerous studies exhibited that flavonoids and phenolic content have contributed to the antioxidant activities of natural compounds. In addition, other studies also reported that trace metals such as Cu, Zn, Mg, Mn, and Se perform a significant function in antioxidant system [39]. Moreover, dietary antioxidants including tocopherols, carotenoids, and ascorbic acid have been investigated [50]. Several synthetic antioxidant supplements have been produced to remediate oxidative stress. Nevertheless, the factors such as lack of availability, high cost, and side effects remain as the main challenge in dealing with oxidative stress. For example, butylated hydroxyanisole and butylated hydroxytoluene have been widely used as a synthetic antioxidant in food industry and could possibly cause side effects like carcinogenesis and liver damage [50]. However, natural antioxidants are abundant in several plant sources, free from side effects, and less expensive. The natural compound based antioxidant substances perform a preventive role in protecting against the generation of free radicals and therefore natural based antioxidants are one of the more valuable therapeutic agents to reduce the illnesses triggered by oxidative stress [39].Numerous studies exhibited that flavonoids and phenolic content have contributed to the antioxidant activities of natural compounds.

The anti-inflammatory activities of natural compounds have been reported in several studies and have been observed in numerous preclinical studies [39]. The findings from anti-inflammatory researches have proven that bioactive extracts and their natural compounds exert their biological properties by blocking two major signaling pathways such as NF-𝜅B and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) which have the main role in the production of various proinflammatory mediators.

        <p>Development of effective and economical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with minimal or no gastrointestinal (GI) side effects is an area of importance in drug discovery pharmaceutical industry. The use of the most frequently recommended drugs of analgesics such as aspirin currently is restricted because of their possible side effects such as severe gastric disorders and other GI side effects. Anti-inflammatory drugs include "biologicals" like anticytokine therapies which block the activity of various kinases and show a significant decrease in host defence toward infections. Due to these side effects and health problems of existing anti-inflammatory therapies, natural anti-inflammatory supplements are becoming more popular and many scientific investigations have been concentrated on this area. In recent years, enormous deal of effort has focused on using available experimental techniques to verify natural antioxidant and anti-inflammatory drugs from natural product resources. This review article will provide scientific knowledge toward anti-inflammatory drug development for various chronic inflammatory associated diseases/disorders from natural products (Figure 15).Development of effective and economical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with minimal or no gastrointestinal (GI) side effects is an area of importance in drug discovery pharmaceutical industry. The use of the most frequently recommended drugs of analgesics such as aspirin currently is restricted because of their possible side effects such as severe gastric disorders and other GI side effects.
