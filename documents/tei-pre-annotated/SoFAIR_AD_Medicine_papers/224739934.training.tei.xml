        <p>Physical inactivity, defined as engaging in insufficient levels of physical activity and not meeting the current physical activity recommendations, 1 has been identified as the fourth leading risk factor of premature mortality in adulthood. 2 In contrast, accumulating sufficient moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is recognised as a key determinant of physical, mental, social and environmental health. 3,4 Among children and youth (5-17 years), several systematic reviews have reported physical activity benefits on physical, physiological, developmental, mental, cognitive, and social health as well as academic achievement. [5][6][7][8][9][10] Despite these benefits, it has been estimated that 80% of youth (11-17 years old) worldwide do not reach the minimum recommendation of 60 minutes of MVPA per day. 11 This is alarming given that physical inactivity among school-aged children and youth has been found to be associated with adverse physical, mental, social and cognitive health outcomes 5,8,12,13 , lower physical fitness, 14 and lower physical activity levels in later life. 15 To achieve a better understanding of the global variation in child and youth physical activity and its correlates, the Global Matrix of Report Card grades on physical activity was launched for the first time in 2014. 16 Physical activity Report Cards were developed based on the Canadian Report Card model, 17 using a harmonized process for data gathering, assessing, and assigning grades to indicators. For over a decade, the Canadian Report Card has been successful in raising awareness and influencing policies for childhood physical activity promotion. However these efforts have not yet translated into improving the physical activity levels of Canadian children and youth. 18 Fifteen countries in 2014 (Global Matrix 1.0), and 38 countries in 2016 (Global Matrix 2.0), developed and launched Report Cards presenting grades for nine physical activity indicators, allowing for international comparisons and offering insights from global data. 16,19 The first two Global Matrices enabled the identification of several gaps in surveillance and research practice. Also, a paradox of higher physical activity and lower sedentary behavior in countries reporting poorer infrastructure, and lower physical activity and higher sedentary behavior in countries reporting better infrastructure was highlighted. 16,19 While participation in the Global Matrices 1.0 and 2.0 facilitated capacity building, professional networking, research collaborations, and international comparisons, the Global Matrix framework still needs to be continuously expanded, improved, replicated and widely disseminated. 19 The Global Matrix initiative is led by the Active Healthy Kids Global Alliance (AHKGA), which is an incorporated not-for-profit organization consisting of researchers, health professionals and stakeholders who collaborate to advance physical activity in children and youth from around the world. 20 In 2017, the AHKGA invited previous participating countries and called for new countries to register for the Global Matrix 3.0. As a result, work groups from 49 countries completed the full registration process and followed the harmonized procedures to develop their Report Cards by grading 10 common indicators (Overall Physical Activity, Organized Sport and Physical Activity, Active Play, Active Transportation, Sedentary Behaviors, Physical Fitness, Family and Peers, School, Community and Environment, and Government) using the best available data.Physical inactivity, defined as engaging in insufficient levels of physical activity and not meeting the current physical activity recommendations, 1 has been identified as the fourth leading risk factor of premature mortality in adulthood. 2 In contrast, accumulating sufficient moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is recognised as a key determinant of physical, mental, social and environmental health. 3,4 Among children and youth (5-17 years), several systematic reviews have reported physical activity benefits on physical, physiological, developmental, mental, cognitive, and social health as well as academic achievement.

        <p>Countries in different development stages may have different challenges and priorities to inform strategies to improve physical activity among children and youth. Countries involved in the Global Matrix 3.0 were classified within three categories using the Human Development Index (HDI): low and medium HDI (&lt;0.70), high HDI (≥0.70 to &lt;0.80), and very high HDI (≥0.80). The HDI, ranging from zero to one, is a composite index calculated using data on education, life expectancy, and income per capita, 21 and was created by the United Nations Development Programme to rank countries on a scale of human development conceptualized in terms of capabilities of humans within the countries to function. 22 Nine of the participating countries were classified as low or medium HDI (Bangladesh, Botswana, Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa, and Zimbabwe), 10 as high HDI (Brazil, Bulgaria, China, Colombia, Ecuador, Lebanon, Mexico, Thailand, Uruguay, and Venezuela), and 30 countries and territories as very high HDI (Australia, Belgium [Flanders], Canada, Chile, Chinese Taipei [Taiwan], Czech Republic, Denmark, England, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Guernsey, Hong Kong, Japan, Jersey, Lithuania, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Scotland, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, United Arab Emirates, United States, and Wales).Countries in different development stages may have different challenges and priorities to inform strategies to improve physical activity among children and youth.

        <p>In April 2017, the AHKGA invited interested countries to participate in, and register for the Global Matrix 3.0 through an open call that was distributed via established networks. Between April 2017 and January 2018, 49 countries from six different continents (Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, and South America) registered and paid a registration fee based on their HDI classification to cover costs associated with the Global Matrix 3.0 initiative. Three different tiers of registration fees ($500 USD for the low HDI countries, $750 USD for the medium HDI countries, $1,000 USD for the high HDI countries, and $1,500 USD for the very high HDI countries) were offered to encourage equitable participation from around the world. Individuals who registered on behalf of their country were responsible for leading the effort to form a multidisciplinary Report Card work group of national physical activity experts and stakeholders. Furthermore, one to three Report Card leaders/co-leaders per country were designated officially to manage the national Report Card development, and to ensure effective communication between the AHKGA Executive Committee and the Report Card work group.In April 2017, the AHKGA invited interested countries to participate in, and register for the Global Matrix 3.0 through an open call that was distributed via established networks.

        <p>An updated list of indicators (to which grades would be assigned) and corresponding benchmarks were created based on the previous Global Matrix methods, 19 and feedback received during a workshop after the Global Matrix 2.0 launch in Bangkok, Thailand (November, 2016). A new indicator, Physical Fitness, and its corresponding benchmarks were added to the list. The benchmark for Overall Physical Activity was modified in accordance with the new Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for Children and Youth, 27 where "at least 60 minutes of MVPA per day" was changed to "at least 60 minutes of MVPA per day on average". Further modifications to the benchmarks were made during the development of the Global Matrix 3.0 to address several issues that were reported by Report Card leaders to the AHKGA Executive Committee. The final version of the benchmarks for the 10 indicators is presented in Table 1. A more detailed grading scheme using positive (+) and negative (-) mathematical symbols, was also developed (Table 2). In some countries, because of the modifications of the benchmarks from previous Global Matrices, grades for some indicators have changed while in fact, the situation was relatively the same. Consequently, while the Report Card work groups reported grades based on the revised benchmarks for the Global Matrix 3.0, some countries reported different grades in their national Report Grades (i.e., to be consistent with their previous methods). For example, in Colombia, with the new benchmark, a "D+" was assigned to Overall Physical Activity for the Global Matrix 3.0, while a "D-" is reported in the Colombian country Report Card, based on the previous benchmark. 28 Each country work group identified and complemented the list of indicators to be graded (i.e., the 10 common indicators and potentially additional ones that would be included in their national Report Card but not in the Global Matrix 3.0) and gathered the highest quality of published and unpublished evidence, or in some cases collected data prospectively. Due to the lack of data concerning physical activity among children in the early years (0 -4 years) observed in the previous Global Matrices, consensus was reached among the AHKGA Executive Committee that the 10 indicator grades should only be informed by data from school-aged children and youth (~5-17 years-old) for the Global Matrix 3.0 to ensure consistency across countries. Where possible, countries were also advised to consider and synthesize the best available evidence from approximately the past five years for each indicator. Through a harmonized and transparent Report Card development process, each country's work group collected and collated the best available evidence from local, national or international studies, national surveys, official reports, and normative documents, and then synthesized findings and reached consensus for the grading of each indicator. A draft of each country Report Card grades were submitted along with their rationale by Report Card leaders and were audited by members of the AHKGA Executive Committee to ensure that the grades were consistent with the harmonized benchmarks and grading scheme. This audit process led to minor changes of the grades or rationale for most of the countries.An updated list of indicators (to which grades would be assigned) and corresponding benchmarks were created based on the previous Global Matrix methods, 19 and feedback received during a workshop after the Global Matrix 2.0 launch in Bangkok, Thailand (November, 2016).

        <p>Sociodemographic data that are available online were compiled to identify the characteristics of the participating countries. Descriptive statistics (average grade and standard deviation) were calculated after converting categorical variables (letter grades) to interval variables (see corresponding numbers in Table 2), and the incomplete grades (INC) were converted into "No Grade" which was treated as a missing value. Averages were calculated by country, indicator, and category of HDI from the interval values and the floor (the number rounded down) was converted back to a letter grade. Three scores were generated for the analysis: 1) Overall score computed as the sum of interval values for all indicators, 2) Behavioral score (the sum of Overall Physical Activity, Organized Sport and Physical Activity, Active Play, Active Transportation, and Sedentary Behaviors interval values), and 3) Sources of influence score (the sum of Family and Peers, School, Community and Environment, and Government interval values). "INC" grades were removed, and the scores were re-weighted accordingly (i.e., the missing grade was replaced by the sum of the interval values divided by the number of letter grades included in the score). Categorical variables (letter grades) were grouped into four ("A-B", "C", "D-F", and "No Grade") based on the overall score. These categories were then used to rank countries by the letter grade/score and category level in scatter plots. Correlational analyses between the 10 common indicators and sociodemographic indicators were performed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. Only significant moderate to strong correlations were considered for the discussion in this analysis (r ≥0.30 or r ≤-0.30, p&lt;0.05). 29 Pairwise deletion was used to treat missing data (INC grades) in order to minimize the number of cases excluded from the analysis. All statistical analyses were performed, and maps were created in

        <p>The physical activity grades for the 10 common indicators are organized by country in alphabetical order (Table 4). A total of 490 grades, including 369 letter grades and 121 "INC" grades, were assigned by the 49 Report Card work groups. A "Not Applicable" grade was assigned to Active Transportation by Qatar's Report Card work group because of unsafe road conditions and a hot climate during most of the year. 34 The grade count, number of "INC" grades, mean number grade, standard deviation, and mean letter grade by indicator and group of indicators are presented in Table 5. The indicators with the lowest number of "INC" grades were Overall Physical Activity and Active Transportation (n = 2), while the indicator with the highest number of "INC" grades was Active Play (n = 29), followed by Physical Fitness (n = 27), and Family and Peers (n = 22). The mean letter grades ranged from "D" for Overall Physical Activity to "C" for Organized Sport and Physical Activity, Active Transportation, School, Community and Environment, and Government. An average grade of "C-" was obtained for the behavioral indicators combined, "C" for the sources of influence indicators combined, and "C-" was the overall average grade for the 369 letter grades. The average letter grades by indicator and group of indicators for the low and medium, high, and very high HDI countries are presented in Table 6. For the low and medium HDI countries, an average of "C" was obtained for the behavioral indicators combined and "D+" for the source of influence indicators combined, while for the very high HDI countries, an average of "D+" was obtained for the behavioral indicators combined and "C+" for the sources of influence indicators combined. For the high HDI countries, an average of "D+" was obtained for the behavioral indicators combined and for the sources of influence indicators combined.

Slovenia ranked first while China ranked 49 th for the overall score (full rankings are shown in Figure 1); Nepal ranked first, and Estonia ranked last for the behavioral score (complete rankings are shown in Figure 2); and Slovenia ranked first while Venezuela ranked last for the source of influence score (see all country rankings in Figure 3). The Online Supplementary File S1 presents the correlation coefficients and their associated p-values between and within the 10 core physical activity indicators and the sociodemographic indicators. It showed that there were no statistically significant relationships between the Overall Physical Activity grade and the other core indicator grades with the exception of Sedentary Behaviors for which a statistically significant positive weak correlation was observed (r = 0.39, p&lt;0.05). Finally, presented in the Online Supplementary File S2 is the distribution of the grades ("A-B", "C", "D-F", or "INC" grades) for the 10 common indicators and the average grades per country. Slovenia was the only country out of 49 with a very high grade for Overall Physical Activity ("A-") while most of the other countries had "D-F" (n = 38). A greater variability in grades was observed for Sedentary Behaviors, but poor grades ("D-F") were observed in most of the very high HDI countries.A plot for the estimated overall score of each country from the 10 indicators is presented in Figure 1 and the behavioral and sources of influence scores are shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively.

        <p>As a result of the efforts of the Report Card work groups, the Global Matrix 3.0 allowed us to present physical activity-related indicators for children and youth assembled across 49 countries with varying levels of human development (nine low and medium HDI, ten high HDI, and 30 very high HDI countries). While the average grades calculated for the indicators were all between "D" and "C" (Table 5), a great variety of grades was observed within and across the countries (Table 4), showing that every country is facing unique challenges and can learn from the successes or difficulties experienced by others.As a result of the efforts of the Report Card work groups, the Global Matrix 3.0 allowed us to present physical activity-related indicators for children and youth assembled across 49 countries with varying levels of human development (nine low and medium HDI, ten high HDI, and 30 very high HDI countries).

        <p>Slovenia obtained the best grade on average ("B"), followed by two other very high HDI countries (Japan and Denmark) that both obtained an average grade of "B-". The specifics of childhood physical activity in these three countries has already been discussed in the paper presenting the findings from the very high HDI countries. 26 These three countries were also leading the ranking based on the sources of influence score (Figure 3). The ranking of the behavioral score was dominated by two low HDI countries (Nepal and Zimbabwe) and Japan (Figure 2).

        <p>Nepal lacked data to inform five of the 10 indicators that were assigned an "INC" grade (Organized Sport and Physical Activity, Active Play, Physical Fitness, School, and Government). A "D+" was assigned to Overall Physical Activity based on a study that found that only 39.8% of children and youth accumulated at least 60 minutes of MVPA per day. Nevertheless, Nepal shared the best grade for Active Transportation with Japan and Zimbabwe ("A-"), obtained a high grade for Sedentary Behaviors ("B+") and also scored highest for the Family and Peers indicator ("A"). These grades were all informed by local studies focusing on adolescents. 35 Nepal's good grades in many of the indicators including Active Transportation and Sedentary Behavior may be associated with low automobile dependency (e.g., 7.12 vehicles for 1,000 people in 2011), 36 and minimal opportunities and access to screen-based recreational sedentary pursuits such as television-and computer-time, and time spent using the internet. Nepal had 5.30 televisions per 1,000 people (as of 2003); 4.37 computer (as of 2004), and 4.51 internet subscribers (as of 2012) for 1,000 people. 37 Due to the concurrent economic development in recent years in Nepal, the number of motorized vehicles is increasing rapidly with the expansion of road networks in rural areas, 38 and potentially more people have access to screen devices. These findings should be interpreted with caution, but they do suggest that the situation can potentially be positive in Nepal in terms of child and youth's active transportation and sedentary behaviors at present. Yet, these favorable behaviors might be threatened by the economic growth and development and these physical activity behaviors may be more a function of poor economic development than a freely chosen physical activity. Nonetheless, more good quality research with nationally representative data is needed to obtain more reliable estimates of the physical activity of children and youth and to inform the grades with "INC" grades.Nepal lacked data to inform five of the 10 indicators that were assigned an "INC" grade (Organized Sport and Physical Activity, Active Play, Physical Fitness, School, and Government).

        <p>Zimbabwe had the second-best grade for Overall Physical Activity ("C+") after Slovenia, with high grades for most of the behavioral indicators ("B" for Organized Sport and Physical Activity, "A-" for Active Transportation, and "B" for Sedentary Behaviors); however, its sources of influence indicators were assigned grades between "D" and "C". In comparison with the previous Report Card in Zimbabwe, the grades for School, Community and Environment, and Government, have improved due to recent policy implementations and commitments made by the government to promote physical activity and nutritional status among Zimbabwean children and youth. 39 However, there is need for caution in interpreting these grades as they were informed by limited and mostly unpublished data and expert opinion. Thus, more research is needed to obtain a reliable picture of the context of the physical activity level of children and youth in Zimbabwe.Zimbabwe had the second-best grade for Overall Physical Activity ("C+") after Slovenia, with high grades for most of the behavioral indicators ("B" for Organized Sport and Physical Activity, "A-" for Active Transportation, and "B" for Sedentary Behaviors); however, its sources of influence indicators were assigned grades between "D" and "C".

        <p>Overall Physical Activity was the indicator with the lowest average grade: "D". A distinction was observed between the low and medium HDI countries and the two other HDI groupings. The average grade for the low and medium HDI countries was "C-", whereas both the high and very high HDI countries obtained an average of "D-", which could represent a difference of 14-26% in physical activity guidelines adherence ("D-" = 20-26% vs. "C-" 40-46%). In accordance with this difference of grades, a significant low negative correlation was observed between the Overall Physical Activity indicator and several sociodemographic indicators including the HDI (r = -0.3, p&lt;0.05) and the growth national income per capita (r = -0.33, p&lt;0.05) (see Online Supplementary File, S1). The present study provides new evidence showing that the situation regarding the physical activity of children and youth is a universal concern worldwide. This finding is consistent with the results from the previous Global Matrices 16,19 and recent global estimates. 11 Efforts should be made globally and collectively to develop standardized physical activity surveillance systems adapted to the national context of each country. Furthermore, developing effective strategies to increase physical activity opportunities for all should be a national public health priority in all countries regardless of the HDI background.Overall Physical Activity was the indicator with the lowest average grade: "D".

        <p>An "INC" grade was assigned for this indicator in seven countries: Bangladesh, Botswana, Ecuador, India, Jersey, Nepal, and United Arab Emirates. The Organized Sport and Physical Activity grades ranged from "F" (Lebanon and Uruguay) to "A-" (Denmark), with an average of "C". The benchmark recommended for this indicator was the "percentage of children and youth who participate in organized sport and/or physical activity programs" (Table 1), meaning that this indicator did not provide any information on the dose (i.e., duration, frequency, intensity) of physical activity while participating in sport and organized physical activities, because few countries have such data. The grade for this indicator depends on the availability of organized sport opportunities and the availability of data reporting the prevalence of children and youth who have taken advantage of these opportunities. This grade was mostly informed by official reports from governmental and/or public institutions as well as self-reported surveys.An "INC" grade was assigned for this indicator in seven countries: Bangladesh, Botswana, Ecuador, India, Jersey, Nepal, and United Arab Emirates.

        <p>Organized Sport and Physical Activity was graded "C", "D+", and "C+" on average for the low and medium HDI countries, the high HDI countries, and the very high HDI countries, respectively. Among the nine low and medium HDI countries, five assigned a letter grade to this indicator, which ranged from "D" to "B", with an average of "C". In these countries, the organized sport opportunities corresponded mostly to school-based sports or sport teams and recreational sports organized by non-governmental organizations and communities. Among the high HDI countries, the grades ranged from "F" to "C+" with an average of "D+". However, it is not possible to discern from the available data if these low grades correspond to the limited availability of organized sport opportunities (i.e., distal correlates) or if there are barriers (e.g., proximal correlates such as motivation, interest, time, or parental support) hindering children from participating while organized physical activities are readily available to them. In the very high HDI countries, with an average grade of "C+", Organized Sport and Physical Activity was the highest graded behavioral indicator. In these countries, organized sport opportunities are available to children and youth in various settings: sport club and federations, school-based sport teams and organized sport sessions, municipal sport programs, and sport programs offered by private businesses. In addition, significant low to moderate positive associations were observed between Organized Sport and Physical Activity and several sociodemographic indicators including HDI, life expectancy at birth, mean years of schooling, growth national income per capita, public health expenditure (% of GDP), Global Food Security index, improved drinking water coverage, and summer Olympic medal count; while significant low negative associations between this indicator and the two inequality indices (Gini index and Gender inequality index) (see Online Supplementary File, S1) were observed.Organized Sport and Physical Activity was graded "C", "D+", and "C+" on average for the low and medium HDI countries, the high HDI countries, and the very high HDI countries, respectively.

        <p>More research is needed to examine if affordable and appealing organized physical activity and sport opportunities are offered to all children and youth equally and equitably-across different age, gender, socioeconomic, ethnic, and special population groups-and to isolate the missing components of organized sports opportunities in each country. In addition, it would be interesting to add the measurement of the dose of physical activity associated with organized sports and physical activities in national physical activity surveillance systems. Filling these research and surveillance gaps is a necessary step towards the development of effective strategies to promote physical activity by increasing organized sport opportunities at the national level.More research is needed to examine if affordable and appealing organized physical activity and sport opportunities are offered to all children and youth equally and equitably-across different age, gender, socioeconomic, ethnic, and special population groups-and to isolate the missing components of organized sports opportunities in each country.

        <p>Given the amount of "INC" grades and the variability of the data used to inform the grades for the Active Play indicator, a valid comparison between the three HDI groupings was difficult. The low grades that were reported for this indicator aligned with the previous Global Matrices findings. 16,19 Such low level of engagement in active play can potentially be explained by the low detection capacity of instruments utilized for its measurement. Active play during free time may be slowly disappearing in favour of screen time in developed countries or is replaced with chores or work in developing countries. Perception of the environment as unsafe can also be a potential barrier to this behavior. However, no relation was found between Active Play and the Community and Environment indicators (Online Supplementary File, S1).Given the amount of "INC" grades and the variability of the data used to inform the grades for the Active Play indicator, a valid comparison between the three HDI groupings was difficult.

Active play during free time may be slowly disappearing in favour of screen time in developed countries or is replaced with chores or work in developing countries. Perception of the environment as unsafe can also be a potential barrier to this behavior. However, no relation was found between Active Play and the Community and Environment indicators (Online Supplementary File, S1).</p>

        <p>Active Transportation was the indicator with the highest average grade for the low and medium HDI countries ("C+") and for the high HDI countries ("C").

In three of the four very high HDI countries from Eastern Asia, very high grades were assigned to this indicator: Japan ("A-"), Hong Kong ("B+"), and South Korea ("B+"). These three countries share similar characteristics historically, culturally, and developmentally, 65 and have shown a high percentage of urban population (83.3% to 100%, Table 3). A specific policy in Japan (limiting the distance between the children and youth homes and the public elementary and junior high schools), 66 and the high density of Hong Kong, and Japanese and South Korean cities, allow children and youth to live a short trip away from their school, which can minimize the use of car or other forms of motorized vehicles, and promote active travel. 26,67,68 High to very high grades for this indicator were also reported in several developing countries: Colombia ("B"), Nepal ("A-"), Nigeria ("B"), Venezuela ("B-"), and Zimbabwe ("A-"), while poor grades were reported for 16 of the 30 very high HDI countries (with grades between "F" and "C-"). However, no statistically significant relation was found between Active Transportation and Community and Environment indicators or the HDI in the correlational analysis. These findings suggest that, for developing countries, active transportation may be driven by a necessity (i.e., no access to public or family/personal motorized transportation) instead of a choice, 69 notwithstanding the safety of the environment or the long distance to commute. The measurement of the dose and the characteristics of children's and youth's active transportation internationally are necessary to identify the contribution of active transport to overall physical activity levels, as well as the facilitators and obstacles for this behavior in order to develop contextually adapted, effective ways to promote it.

For example, in the United States, the percentage of schools delivering mandatory physical education classes, in each grade, decrease from 97% in 6th grade to 42% in 12th grade. 82 In the United Arab Emirates, only 26% of adolescents aged 13-17 years reported participating in physical education class on three or more days each week. 83 In South Africa, 32% of children do not participate in school physical education classes, and no evidence of progress in the prioritization of physical education in the schools was found by the Report Card work group. 84 Similarly, two consecutive Report Cards from South Korea highlighted that the emphasis on important subjects (e.g., math, science) for university admission overrides the importance of physical activity in the Korean education system. 85,86 Though the new 2018 Korean national curriculum requires schools to provide mandatory physical education, it is regarded as a minor subject and, with progressing school grades, it is devalued and neglected. 87 Evidence showed that adding more time to academic or curricular subjects by taking time away from physical education programs was found not to enhance academic achievement in the corresponding academic subjects and to be potentially detrimental to health. 88 Conversely, allocating more time to physical activity from other subjects can improve the time children spend engaging in MVPA without the risk of "hindering students' academic achievement". 88 The measure of the dose of physical activity occurring in school should also be added to the national surveillance systems globally to identify the needs in terms of policies and interventions aimed at promoting physical activity at school.

With an average of "C-", Government was the source of influence indicator with the highest average in low and medium HDI countries. The high HDI countries obtained an average of "D+", and the very high HDI countries a "C+". The highest grades for this indicator were reported in high and very high HDI countries. The correlation analysis found significant low associations between the Government indicator and the growth national income per capita (r = 0.48, p&lt;0.005), public health expenditure (r = 0.48, p&lt;0.005), Gini index (r = -0.45, p&lt;0.005), Gender Inequality Index (r = -0.45, p&lt;0.005), improved water coverage (r = 0.44, p&lt;0.005), and distance to the equator (r = 0.31, p&lt;0.005).The average grade for the Government grade was "C", and an "INC" grade was assigned in eight countries.

        <p>Similar to the Community and Environment indicator, a government can potentially influence the physical activity level of children and youth in multiple ways. As there is no official standardized method to evaluate this influence, the recommended benchmark for this indicator focused on evidence of leadership and commitment, allocated funds and resources, and demonstrated progress for the promotion of physical activity opportunities for all children and youth (Table 1). As a result, the grades were informed by very different types of data across countries, and the Report Card work groups did not always have access to relevant quantitative data, and therefore graded this indicator mostly based on expert opinion when required.Similar to the Community and Environment indicator, a government can potentially influence the physical activity level of children and youth in multiple ways.

        <p>The low behavioral grades that were reported broadly in the Global Matrix 3.0 suggest that the government's efforts and physical activity policies are not reflected in an increase in the prevalence of MVPA among children and youth, and/or that there is an implementation gap between the strategy level (source of influence indicators) and individual level (behavioral indicators). More research is needed globally to identify the potential barriers for the engagement of children at the country and community level, in different contexts and settings.The low behavioral grades that were reported broadly in the Global Matrix 3.0 suggest that the government's efforts and physical activity policies are not reflected in an increase in the prevalence of MVPA among children and youth, and/or that there is an implementation gap between the strategy level (source of influence indicators) and individual level (behavioral indicators).

        <p>Overall, the average grades obtained for each indicator were low, and a small variation was observed within the 10 indicators ("D" to "C"). More diversity was observed between the three HDI groupings, between the countries, and within each country. Higher behavioral grades and lower source of influence grades were generally observed in the low and medium HDI countries, while the opposite was observed for the very high HDI countries, and generally low average grades were reported for each indicator in the high HDI countries. It is important to highlight that the overall concerning levels of physical activity and sedentary behavior among children and youth may be indicative of a global crisis. Moreover, this phenomenon may get worse with the economic growth and development of low, medium and high HDI countries, and very high rates of non-communicable diseases can be anticipated when the current generation of children and youth reaches adulthood unless a major shift to a more active lifestyle happens soon. Strategies to mitigate the projected reduction in habitual physical activity in developing countries should learn from countries who have already navigated the physical activity transition. 92Overall, the average grades obtained for each indicator were low, and a small variation was observed within the 10 indicators ("D" to "C").

        <p>A major limitation of this study was the amount of missing data to inform the grades, resulting in a total of 121 "INC" grades of the 490 grades in total. In addition, the great variability of the data (e.g., in terms of benchmark, measurement instrument, age range, sample size, quality, quantity) that were used to inform the grades was observed between the countries for each indicator, and in many cases the available data did not permit the Report Card work groups to align strictly with the recommended benchmarks.A major limitation of this study was the amount of missing data to inform the grades, resulting in a total of 121 "INC" grades of the 490 grades in total.

        <p>Furthermore, a loss of information potentially occurred when translating original prevalence data to a letter grade, as letter grades provide less information than continuous variables. Consequently, all the comparisons, correlations and interpretations involving the grades are limited and should be interpreted with caution, as two identical grades for the same indicator can capture two very different contexts from one country to another. Excluding the countries with insufficient data and imposing to assign "INC" grades every time the data did not fit exactly with the benchmarks for each indicator could have been an alternative strategy. But this approach would have significantly reduced the number of countries and grades included in the Global Matrix 3.0 and the relevance of conducting international comparisons.Furthermore, a loss of information potentially occurred when translating original prevalence data to a letter grade, as letter grades provide less information than continuous variables.

        <p>Another limitation of the Global Matrix 3.0 was the lack of representativeness of some areas of the world and some specific child and youth populations. Indeed, the participation of a total of 49 countries or nations meant that most of the countries around the world were still missing. In particular, the South Pacific islands nations, where the average body mass indices for child and youth were estimated to be the highest of the world, 93 are missing, as well as countries from Central Asia, and North Africa.Another limitation of the Global Matrix 3.0 was the lack of representativeness of some areas of the world and some specific child and youth populations.

        <p>Additionally, children and youth with disabilities were not explicitly included in this analysis while the Global Matrix process could help to identify and circulate best-practice strategies in terms of physical activity promotion for these specific populations. 19 Furthermore, the disparities and inequities across gender, socioeconomic status, or urban versus rural dwelling were mentioned in only a handful of Report Card articles, thus they were not analyzed or discussed in this study.Additionally, children and youth with disabilities were not explicitly included in this analysis while the Global Matrix process could help to identify and circulate best-practice strategies in terms of physical activity promotion for these specific populations. 19 Furthermore, the disparities and inequities across gender, socioeconomic status, or urban versus rural dwelling were mentioned in only a handful of Report Card articles, thus they were not analyzed or discussed in this study.</p>
        <p>The correlation analyses showed that the Overall Physical Activity grade had a low positive association with Sedentary Behaviors and was not statistically related with the eight remaining indicators (Online Supplementary File, S1). This can potentially be the consequence of the aforementioned limitations, but another hypothesis may explain this absence of relation. The absence of statistically significant correlations between Overall Physical Activity, and Organized Sport and Physical Activity, Active Play, and Active Transportation, may have resulted from the fact that the physical activity dose related to these indicators was not measured well. The absence of a relation between the source of influence indicators and Overall Physical Activity may suggest that a favorable physical and social environment is not enough to induce individual engagement in sufficient amounts of MVPA. In addition, the absence of choice (i.e., children that have no other options than using active transportation regardless of safety and any other characteristics of the source of influence), child labor, and the cultural values attributed to physical activity and sports were not evaluated in this study.The correlation analyses showed that the Overall Physical Activity grade had a low positive association with Sedentary Behaviors and was not statistically related with the eight remaining indicators (Online Supplementary File, S1).

        <p>Major strengths of this work include the large number of countries who adopted the harmonized Report Card development process and the quantity of data used to inform an international, comprehensive and meaningful comparison of physical activity behaviors of children and youth. In addition, the AHKGA facilitated and supported the development of Report Cards from 49 countries, by providing the Report Card work groups from each participating country with a platform to capture, synthesize, interpret, and publish the findings with autonomy. With the 49 countries participating and the 10 common indicators being graded by each participating country, the Global Matrix 3.0 represents the most comprehensive and meaningful comparison of the contexts of the physical activity of children and youth. In addition, the identification and discussion of major trends concerning the characteristics of the physical activity of children and youth among the three HDI groupings were realized for the first time. [24][25][26] Finally, major research and surveillance gaps, including the need for the development and the international adoption of standardized methods to conceptualise and measure the ten indicators, were identified and highlighted for each indicator in the present paper.Major strengths of this work include the large number of countries who adopted the harmonized Report Card development process and the quantity of data used to inform an international, comprehensive and meaningful comparison of physical activity behaviors of children and youth.

        <p>The launch of the Global Matrix 3.0 is the result of a tremendous amount of work by the AHKGA Executive Committee members and from the physical activity experts and stakeholders from all over the world for the past 15 months. The 49 Report Cards were developed by supported and unsupported work groups of professionals who acknowledge the importance of a healthy and active lifestyle for the present and the future of the children and youth worldwide. The involvement of governmental and nongovernmental organizations in the development of some of the national Report Cards is a potential sign of a growing interest in the childhood physical inactivity crisis; and it is hoped that this awareness will be translated into support for the development of effective interventions increasing physical activity opportunities for all. In addition, the development of a national Report Card of physical activity for children and youth, and the participation in the Global Matrix initiative, were found to contribute to raising awareness on the childhood physical inactivity issue nationally and internationally, building capacity within participating countries, and potentially influencing the creation of physical activity opportunities in the future. 23 It is hoped that more physical activity experts and stakeholders will rally with AHKGA members to pursue and expand the Global Matrix initiative and will help filling the identified gap in physical activity research and surveillance. The AHKGA, with the contribution of its international network of researchers, will be available to offer guidance to the countries willing to develop national surveillance of physical activity, and policies or interventions promoting physical activity among children and youth.The launch of the Global Matrix 3.0 is the result of a tremendous amount of work by the AHKGA Executive Committee members and from the physical activity experts and stakeholders from all over the world for the past 15 months.
