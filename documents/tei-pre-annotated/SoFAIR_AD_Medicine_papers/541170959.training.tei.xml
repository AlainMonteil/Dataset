        <p>The B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was rst identi ed in the state of Maharashtra in late 2020 and spread throughout India, outcompeting pre-existing lineages including B.1.617.1 (Kappa) and B.1.1.7 (Alpha) 1 . In vitro, B.1.617.2 is sixfold less sensitive to serum neutralizing antibodies from recovered individuals, and eightfold less sensitive to vaccine-elicited antibodies, compared with wild-type Wuhan-1 bearing D614G. Serum neutralizing titres against B.1.617.2 were lower in ChAdOx1 vaccinees than in BNT162b2 vaccinees. B.1.617.2 spike pseudotyped viruses exhibited compromised sensitivity to monoclonal antibodies to the receptor-binding domain and the amino-terminal domain. B.1.617.2 demonstrated higher replication e ciency than B.1.1.7 in both airway organoid and human airway epithelial systems, associated with B.1.617.2 spike being in a predominantly cleaved state compared with B.1.1.7 spike. The B.1.617.2 spike protein was able to mediate highly e cient syncytium formation that was less sensitive to inhibition by neutralizing antibody, compared with that of wild-type spike. We also observed that B.1.617.2 had higher replication and spike-mediated entry than B.1.617.1, potentially explaining the B.1.617.2 dominance. In an analysis of more than 130 SARS-CoV-2-infected health care workers across three centres in India during a period of mixed lineage circulation, we observed reduced ChAdOx1 vaccine e ectiveness against B.1.617.2 relative to non-B.1.617.2, with the caveat of possible residual confounding. Compromised vaccine e cacy against the highly t and immune-evasive B.1.617.2 Delta variant warrants continued infection control measures in the post-vaccination era.The B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was rst identi ed in the state of Maharashtra in late 2020 and spread throughout India, outcompeting pre-existing lineages including B.1.617.1 (Kappa) and B.1.1.7 (Alpha) 1 .

        <p>The first sublineage to be detected was B.1.617.1 (ref. 1 ), followed by B.1.617.2, both bearing the L452R spike receptor-binding motif (RBM) substitution also observed in B.1.427/B.1.429 (refs. 1,5 ). This alteration was previously reported to confer increased infectivity and a modest loss of susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies 6,7 . The B.1.617.2 Delta variant has since dominated over B.1.617.1 (Kappa variant) and other lineages including B.1.1.7, although the reasons remain unclear.The first sublineage to be detected was B.1.617.1 (ref. 1 ), followed by B.1.617.2, both bearing the L452R spike receptor-binding motif (RBM) substitution also observed in B.1.427/B.1.429 (refs. 1,5 ).

        <p>We first plotted the relative proportion of variants in new cases of SARS-CoV-2 in India since the start of 2021. Although B.1.617.1 emerged earlier, the Delta variant B.1.617.2 has become more dominant (Fig. 1a). We hypothesized that B.1.617.2 would exhibit immune evasion to antibody responses generated by previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. We used sera from 12 individuals infected during the first UK wave in mid-2020. These sera were tested for their ability to neutralize a B.1.617.2 viral isolate, in comparison with a B.1.1.7 variant isolate and a wild-type (WT) Wuhan-1 virus bearing D614G in spike. The Delta variant contains several spike alterations that are located at positions within the structure that are predicted to alter its function (Fig. 1b). We found that the B.1.1.7 virus isolate was 2.3-fold less sensitive to the sera than the WT, and that B.1.617.2 was 5.7-fold less sensitive to the sera (Fig. 1c). Importantly, in the same assay, the B.1.351 Beta variant that was first identified in South Africa demonstrated an 8.2-fold loss of neutralization sensitivity relative to the WT.We first plotted the relative proportion of variants in new cases of SARS-CoV-2 in India since the start of 2021.

        <p>We used the same B.1.617.2 live virus isolate to test susceptibility to vaccine-elicited serum neutralizing antibodies in individuals following vaccination with two doses of ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2. These experiments showed a loss of sensitivity for B.1.617.2 compared with WT Wuhan-1 bearing D614G of around eightfold for both sets of vaccine sera and reduction against B.1.1.7 that did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 1d). We also used a pseudotyped virus (PV) system to test the neutralization potency of a larger panel of 65 vaccine-elicited sera, this time against B.1.617.1 as well as B.1.617.2 spike compared with Wuhan-1 D614G spike (Fig. 1e). Comparison of demographic data for vaccinees showed similar characteristics (Extended Data Table 1). The mean geometric mean titre (GMT) against Delta variant spike PV was lower for ChAdOx1 than for BNT162b2 (GMT 654 versus 3,372, P &lt; 0001, Extended Data Table 1).We used the same B.1.617.2 live virus isolate to test susceptibility to vaccine-elicited serum neutralizing antibodies in individuals following vaccination with two doses of ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2.

        <p>We investigated the role of the B.1.617.2 spike as an escape mechanism by testing 33 spike-specific monoclonal antibodies with an in vitro PV neutralization assay using Vero E6 target cells expressing transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and the Wuhan-1 D614G SARS-CoV-2 loss (&gt;40-fold-change reduction) of neutralizing activity to B.1.617.2 (Extended Data Fig. 1). Among five clinical-stage RBM monoclonal antibodies tested, bamlanivimab did not neutralize B.1.617.2. Imdevimab, part of the REGN-COV2 therapeutic dual antibody cocktail 8 , displayed reduced neutralizing activity (Extended Data Fig. 1).We investigated the role of the B.1.617.2 spike as an escape mechanism by testing 33 spike-specific monoclonal antibodies with an in vitro PV neutralization assay using Vero E6 target cells expressing transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and the Wuhan-1 D614G SARS-CoV-2 loss (&gt;40-fold-change reduction) of neutralizing activity to B.1.617.2 (Extended Data Fig. 1).

        <p>We first infected a lung epithelial cell line, Calu-3, comparing B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2 (Fig. 2a-d). We observed a replication advantage for B.1.617.2 (Fig. 2a,b), as well as an increase in released virions from cells (Fig. 2c,d). Next we tested B. (Fig. 2b). We next ran western blots on purified virions probing for spike S2 and nucleoprotein, revealing B.1.617.2 spike predominantly in the cleaved form, in contrast to that in B.1 and B.1.1.7 (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b).We first infected a lung epithelial cell line, Calu-3, comparing B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2 (Fig. 2a-d).

        <p>The plasma membrane route of entry, and indeed transmissibility in animal models, is critically dependent on the polybasic cleavage site between S1 and S2 (refs. 9,11,12 ) and cleavage of spike before virion release from producer cells. Alterations at P681 in the polybasic cleavage site have been observed in multiple SARS-CoV-2 lineages, most notably in the B.1.1.7 Alpha variant 13 . We previously showed that B.1.1.7 spike, bearing P681H, had significantly higher fusogenic potential than a D614G Wuhan-1 virus 13 . Here we tested B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 spike using a split GFP system to monitor cell-cell fusion (Extended Data Fig. 2c-g). The B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 spike proteins mediated higher fusion activity and syncytium formation than WT, probably mediated by P681R (Extended Data Fig. 2f,g). We next titrated sera from ChAdOx1 vaccinees and showed that indeed the cell-cell fusion could be inhibited in a manner that mirrored the neutralization activity of the sera against PV infection of cells (Extended Data Fig. 2h). Hence, B.1.617.2 may induce cell-cell fusion in the respiratory tract and possibly higher pathogenicity even in vaccinated individuals with neutralizing antibodies.The plasma membrane route of entry, and indeed transmissibility in animal models, is critically dependent on the polybasic cleavage site between S1 and S2 (refs. 9,11,12 ) and cleavage of spike before virion release from producer cells.

B.1.617 spike proteins were present predominantly in the cleaved form, in contrast to WT (Fig. 2h, i and Extended Data Fig. 3c).

        <p>We hypothesized that vaccine effectiveness against B.1.617.2 would be compromised relative to that against other circulating variants. Vaccination of health care workers (HCWs) started in early 2021 with the ChAdOx1 vaccine (Covishield). During the wave of infections in March and April, symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in 30 vaccinated staff members among a workforce of 3,800 at a single tertiary centre in Delhi. Genomic data from India and Delhi suggested B.1.1.7 dominance (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 4a), with growth of B.1.617 during March 2021. Short-read sequencing 14 of symptomatic non-fatal infections in the HCW outbreak revealed that the majority were B.1.617.2 with a range of other B lineage viruses (Fig. 3a). Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a group of highly related, and in some cases, genetically indistinct sequences that were sampled within 1 or 2 days of each other (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 4b). We next looked in greater detail at the vaccination history of affected individuals. Nearly all had received two doses at least 21 days previously. We obtained similar data on vaccine breakthrough infections in two other health facilities in Delhi with 1,100 and 4,000 HCW staff members, respectively (Fig. 3b,c and Extended Data Fig. 4c,d). In hospital 2, there were 118 sequences, representing more than 10% of the workforce over a 4-week period. After filtering, we reconstructed phylogenies using 66 with high-quality whole-genome coverage &gt;95%. In hospital 3, there were 70 symptomatic infections, with 52 high-quality genomes used for inferring phylogenies after filtering.We hypothesized that vaccine effectiveness against B.1.617.2 would be compromised relative to that against other circulating variants.

        <p>Across the three centres, we noted that the median age and duration of infection of those infected with B.1.617.2 versus non-B.1.617.2 were similar (Extended Data Table 3), with no evidence that B.1.617.2 was associated with higher risk of hospitalization (Extended Data Table 3). Next we evaluated the effect of B.1.617.2 on vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection in the HCWs, compared with other lineages. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate the odds ratio of testing positive with B.1.617.2 versus non-B.1.617.2 in vaccinated relative to unvaccinated individuals 15 , adjusting for age, sex and hospital. The adjusted odds ratio for B.1.617.2 relative to non-B.1.617.2 was 5.45 (95% confidence interval 1.39-21.4, P = 0.018) for two vaccine doses (Extended Data Table 4).Across the three centres, we noted that the median age and duration of infection of those infected with B.1.617.2 versus non-B.1.617.2 were similar (Extended Data Table 3), with no evidence that B.1.617.2 was associated with higher risk of hospitalization (Extended Data Table 3).

        <p>Here we have combined in vitro experimentation and molecular epidemiology to propose that increased replication fitness and reduced sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 to neutralizing antibodies have contributed to the recent rapid increase of B.1.617.2, compared with B.1.1.7 and other lineages such as B.1.617.1, despite high vaccination rates in adults and/ or high prevalence of prior infection 16 . These data are consistent with modelling analyses that support combination of immune evasion and higher transmissibility as likely drivers of the increase in Delta in Delhi 17 .Here we have combined in vitro experimentation and molecular epidemiology to propose that increased replication fitness and reduced sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 to neutralizing antibodies have contributed to the recent rapid increase of B.1.617.2, compared with B.1.1.7 and other lineages such as B.1.617.1, despite high vaccination rates in adults and/ or high prevalence of prior infection 16 .

        <p>It is important to consider that increased infectivity at mucosal surfaces and cell-cell fusion and spread 19 may also facilitate 'evasion' from antibodies 20 . Indeed, our work also shows that B.1.617.2 had a fitness advantage compared with B.1.1.7 across physiologically relevant systems including HAE and three-dimensional airway organoids 10 where cell-free and cell-cell infection are likely to be occurring together. These data support the notion of higher infectiousness of B.1.617.2, either due to higher viral burden or higher particle infectivity, resulting in higher probability of person-to-person transmission. We noted that B.1.617.2 live virus particles contained a higher proportion of cleaved spike than B.1.1.7, and postulated that this is involved in the mechanism of increased infectivity. This hypothesis was supported by our observation that PV particles bearing B.1.617.2 spike demonstrated significantly enhanced entry into a range of target cells.It is important to consider that increased infectivity at mucosal surfaces and cell-cell fusion and spread 19 may also facilitate 'evasion' from antibodies 20 .

Descriptive analyses of demographic and clinical data are presented as median and interquartile range or mean and standard deviation (s.d.) when continuous and as frequency and proportion (%) when categorical. The differences in continuous and categorical data were tested using the Wilcoxon rank sum test or t-test and chi-square test, respectively. The association between the Ct value and the SARS-CoV-2 variant was examined using linear regression. Variants as the dependent variable were categorized into two groups: B.1.617.2 variant and non-B.1.617.2 variants. The following covariates were included in the model irrespective of confounding: age, sex, hospital and interval between symptom onset and nasal swab PCR testing.Vaccine breakthrough infections in HCWs.

        <p>Vaccine effectiveness. To estimate vaccine effectiveness for the B.1.617.2 variant relative to non-B.1.617.2 variants, we adopted a recently described approach 15 . This method is based on the premise that if the vaccine is equally effective against B.1.617.2 and non-B.1.617.2 variants, a similar proportion of cases with each variant would be expected in both vaccinated and unvaccinated cases. This approach overcomes the issue of higher background prevalence of one variant over the other. We determined the proportion of individuals with the B.1.617.2 variant relative to all other circulating variants by vaccination status. We then used logistic regression to estimate the odds ratio of testing positive with B.1.617.2 in vaccinated compared with unvaccinated individuals.Vaccine effectiveness.

        <p>The final regression model was adjusted for age as a continuous variable, and sex and hospital as categorical variables. Model sensitivity and robustness to inclusion of these covariates was tested by an iterative process of sequentially adding the covariates to the model and examining the impact on the odd ratios and confidence intervals until the final model was constructed (Extended Data Table 4). The R 2 measure, as proposed by McFadden 26 , was used to test the fit of different specifications of the same model regression. This is was performed by sequential addition of the variables adjusted for including age, sex and hospital until the final model was constructed. In addition, the absolute difference in the Bayesian information criterion was estimated. The McFadden R 2 measure of final model fitness was 0.11, indicating reasonable model fit. The addition of age, sex and hospital in the final regression model improved the measured fitness. However, the absolute difference in the Bayesian information criterion was 13.34 between the full model and the model excluding the adjusting variable, providing strong support for the parsimonious model. The fully adjusted model was nonetheless used as the final model as the sensitivity analyses (Extended Data Table 4) showed robustness to the addition of the covariates.The final regression model was adjusted for age as a continuous variable, and sex and hospital as categorical variables.

        <p>PV neutralization assay for monoclonal antibody. Vero E6 cells expressing TMPRSS2 or not were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and seeded into white 96-well plates (PerkinElmer, 6005688) at a density of 20 thousand cells per well. The next day, monoclonal antibodies were serially diluted in pre-warmed complete medium, mixed with WT or B.1.617.2 pseudoviruses and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in round-bottom polypropylene plates. Medium from cells was aspirated and 50 µl of virus-monoclonal antibody complexes was added to cells and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. An additional 100 µl of pre-warmed complete medium was then added on top of complexes, and cells were incubated for an additional 16-24 h. Conditions were tested in duplicate wells on each plate and at least six wells per plate contained untreated infected cells (defining the 0% of neutralization, MAX relative light unit (RLU) value) and infected cells in the presence of S2E12 and S2X259 at 25 µg ml -1 each (defining the 100% of neutralization, MIN RLU value). Medium containing virus-monoclonal antibody complexes was then aspirated from cells and 50 µl of a 1:2 dilution of SteadyLite Plus (Perkin Elmer, 6066759) in PBS with Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ was added to cells. Plates were incubated for 15 min at room temperature and then analysed on the Synergy-H1 (Biotek). The average RLU value for untreated infected wells (MAX RLU ave ) was subtracted by the average MIN RLU (MIN RLU ave ) value and used to normalize the percentage of neutralization of individual RLU values of experimental data according to the following formula: (1 -(RLU x - MIN RLU ave )/(MAX RLU ave - MIN RLU ave )) × 100. Data were analysed and visualized with 
            <rs type="software">Prism</rs> (Version 
            <rs type="version">9.1.0</rs>). IC 50 values were calculated from the interpolated value from the log[inhibitor] versus response, using variable slope (four parameters) nonlinear regression with an upper constraint of ≤100, and a lower constraint equal to 0. Each neutralization assay was conducted on two independent experiments (that is, biological replicates), with each biological replicate containing a technical duplicate. IC 50 values across biological replicates are presented as arithmetic mean ± s.d. The loss or gain of neutralization potency across spike variants was calculated by dividing the variant IC 50 by the WT IC 50 within each biological replicate, and then visualized as arithmetic mean ± s.d.
