        <p>nanoparticle vaccine for COVID-19, made of a self-assembling protein nanoparticle displaying the SARS-CoV-2 receptorbinding domain in a highly immunogenic array reminiscent of the natural virus. Their nanoparticle vaccine candidate elicits a diverse, potent, and protective antibody response, including neutralizing antibody titers 10-fold higher than the prefusion-stabilized spike ectodomain trimer.</p>
        <p>The recent emergence of a previously unknown virus in Wuhan, China has resulted in the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that has caused more than 34,000,000 infections and 1,000,000 fatalities as of October 2, 2020 (WHO). Rapid viral isolation and sequencing revealed by January 2020 that the newly emerged zoonotic pathogen was a coronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV and was therefore named SARS-CoV-2 (Zhou et al., 2020c;Zhu et al., 2020b). SARS-CoV-2 is believed to have originated in bats based on the isolation of the closely related RaTG13 virus from Rhinolophus affinis (Zhou et al., 2020c) and the identification of the RmYN02 genome sequence in metagenomics analyses of Rhinolophus malayanus (Zhou et al., 2020b), both from Yunnan, China.</p>
        <p>Similar to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is mediated by the transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein, which forms prominent homotrimers protruding from the viral surface (Tortorici and Veesler, 2019;Walls et al., 2016a;2017). Cryoelectron microscopy structures of SARS-CoV-2 S revealed its shared architecture with SARS-CoV S and provided a blueprint for the design of vaccines and antivirals (Walls et al., 2020;Wrapp et al., 2020). Both SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which serves as entry receptor (Hoffmann et al., 2020;Letko et al., 2020;Li et al., 2003;Walls et al., 2020;Wrapp et al., 2020;Zhou et al., 2020c). Structures of the SARS-CoV-2 S receptor-binding domain (RBD) in complex with ACE2 defined key residues involved in recognition and guide surveillance studies aiming to detect the emergence of mutants with altered binding affinity for ACE2 or distinct antigenicity (Lan et al., 2020;Shang et al., 2020;Starr et al., 2020;Wang et al., 2020b;Yan et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>As the coronavirus S glycoprotein is surface-exposed and initiates infection, it is the main target of neutralizing antibodies (Abs) upon infection and the focus of vaccine design (Tortorici and Veesler, 2019). S trimers are extensively decorated with N-linked glycans that are important for proper folding (Rossen et al., 1998) and for modulating accessibility to host proteases and neutralizing Abs (Walls et al., 2016b;2017;2019;Watanabe et al., 2020;Xiong et al., 2018;Yang et al., 2015). We previously characterized potent human neutralizing Abs from rare memory B cells of individuals infected with SARS-CoV (Rockx et al., 2008;Traggiai et al., 2004) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV (Corti et al., 2015) in complex with their respective S glycoproteins to provide molecular-level information on the mechanism of competitive inhibition of RBD attachment to host receptors (Walls et al., 2019). Passive administration of these Abs protected mice from lethal challenges with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and closely related viruses, indicating that they represent a promising therapeutic strategy against coronaviruses (Corti et al., 2015;Menachery et al., 2015;2016;Rockx et al., 2008). We identified a human monoclonal Ab that neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV through recognition of the RBD from the memory B cells of a SARS survivor obtained 10 years after recovery (Pinto et al., 2020). We recently showed that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD is immunodominant, comprises multiple distinct antigenic sites, and is the target of 90% of the neutralizing activity present in COVID-19 convalescent sera (Piccoli et al., 2020). These findings showed that the RBD is a prime target of neutralizing Abs upon natural CoV infection, in agreement with other reports of the isolation of RBD-targeted neutralizing Abs from COVID-19 convalescent patients (Barnes et al., 2020;Brouwer et al., 2020;Liu et al., 2020;Robbiani et al., 2020;Seydoux et al., 2020;Tortorici et al., 2020;Wang et al., 2020a;Wu et al., 2020) and the demonstration that they provide in vivo protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in small animals and nonhuman primates (Alsoussi et al., 2020;Tortorici et al., 2020;Wu et al., 2020;Zost et al., 2020). Collectively, these observations, along with a correlation between the presence of RBD-directed Abs and neutralization potency of COVID-19 patient plasma (Robbiani et al., 2020), motivate the use of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD as a vaccine immunogen.</p>
        <p>Vaccine development efforts responding to the COVID-19 pandemic have made extensive use of platform technologies for antigen design, antigen display, and vaccine delivery (Kanekiyo et al., 2019a). For example, existing nucleic acid and vectored vaccine platforms enabled rapid entry into the clinic with vaccines encoding SARS-CoV-2 S antigens (Folegatti et al., 2020;Jackson et al., 2020;Mulligan et al., 2020;Sahin et al., 2020;Yu et al., 2020;Zhu et al., 2020a). However, the safety, efficacy, and scalability of these vaccine modalities are not fully understood, as there are currently no DNA or mRNA vaccines licensed for human use, and the first viral vector vaccine was approved only within the last few months (Anywaine et al., 2019). In contrast, self-assembling or particulate protein immunogens are a clinically validated vaccine modality with a proven track record of safety and efficacy in humans (Lo Â´pez-Sagaseta et al., 2015). For example, virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines for human papillomavirus (HPV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) are among the most effective subunit vaccines known, with data suggesting that the HPV vaccines in particular provide potent, durable immunity even after a single vaccination (Kreimer et al., 2018). Recently, self-assembling protein platforms for heterologous antigen display have matured significantly, and several protein nanoparticle vaccines displaying viral glycoprotein antigens are currently being evaluated in clinical trials (NCT03547245, NCT03186781, NCT03814720). A new development in this area has been the emergence of computationally designed protein nanoparticles as a robust and versatile platform for multivalent antigen presentation (Bale et al., 2016;Hsia et al., 2016;King et al., 2012;Ueda et al., 2020). In preclinical studies, vaccine candidates based on designed protein nanoparticles have significantly improved the potency or breadth of Ab responses against numerous antigens, including prefusion respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F (Marcandalli et al., 2019), HIV-1 envelope (Brouwer et al., 2019), influenza hemagglutinin (Boyoglu-Barnum et al., 2020), and P. falciparum cysteine-rich protective antigen (CyRPA) (Bruun et al., 2018), relative to either soluble antigen or commercial vaccine comparators.</p>
        <p>Here, we report designed protein nanoparticle vaccines multivalently displaying the SARS-CoV-2 RBD that elicit potent and protective Ab responses in mice, with neutralizing titers an order of magnitude higher at a $5-fold lower dose than soluble prefusion-stabilized S, while also exhibiting a significantly lower binding:neutralizing ratio than convalescent human sera. We further show that nanoparticle vaccine-elicited Abs recognize multiple distinct RBD epitopes targeted by known neutralizing Abs, suggesting that they may not be easily susceptible to escape mutations.</p>
        <p>To design vaccine candidates that induce potent neutralizing Ab responses, we focused on the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein (Figures 1A and1B). To overcome the limited immunogenicity of this small, monomeric antigen, we multivalently displayed the RBD on the exterior surface of the twocomponent protein nanoparticle I53-50 (Bale et al., 2016). I53-50 is a computationally designed, 28 nm-wide, 120-subunit complex with icosahedral symmetry constructed from trimeric (I53-50A) and pentameric (I53-50B) components (all amino acid sequences provided in Data S1). The nanoparticle can be assembled in vitro by simply mixing independently expressed and purified I53-50A and I53-50B, a feature that has facilitated its use as a platform for multivalent antigen presentation (Brouwer et al., 2019;Marcandalli et al., 2019). The RBD (residues 328-531) was genetically fused to I53-50A using linkers comprising 8, 12, or 16 glycine and serine residues (hereafter referred to as RBD-8GS-, RBD-12GS-, or RBD-16GS-I53-50A) to enable flexible presentation of the antigen extending from the nanoparticle surface (Figure 1C). All RBD-I53-50A constructs were recombinantly expressed using mammalian (Expi293F) cells to ensure proper folding and glycosylation of the viral anti-gen. Initial yields of purified RBD-I53-50A proteins ($30 mg purified protein per liter Expi293F cells) were $20-fold higher than for the prefusion-stabilized S-2P trimer (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018;Pallesen et al., 2017;Walls et al., 2020;Wrapp et al., 2020) ($1.5 mg/L) and increased to $60 mg/L following promoter optimization. The RBD-I53-50A proteins were mixed with pentameric I53-50B purified from E. coli in a $1:1 molar ratio (subunit:subunit) to initiate nanoparticle assembly (Figure 1D).</p>
        <p>Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-I53-50 nanoparticles revealed predominant peaks corresponding to the target icosahedral assemblies and smaller peaks (G) Hydrogen/deuterium-exchange mass spectrometry of monomeric RBD versus trimeric RBD-8GS-I53-50A component, represented here as a butterfly plot, confirms preservation of the RBD conformation, including at epitopes recognized by known neutralizing Abs. In the plot, each point along the horizontal sequence axis represents a peptide where deuterium uptake was monitored from 3 s to 20 h. Error bars shown on the butterfly plot indicate standard deviations from two experimental replicates. The difference plot below demonstrates that monomeric RBD and RBD-8GS-I53-50A are virtually identical in local structural ordering across the RBD. (H) Pie charts summarizing the glycan composition at the N-linked glycosylation sites N331 and N343 in five protein samples: monomeric RBD, S-2P trimer, RBD-8GS-, RBD-12GS-, and RBD-16GS-I53-50A trimeric components. The majority of the complex glycans at both sites were fucosylated; minor populations of nonfucosylated glycans are indicated by dashed white lines. Oligo, oligomannose.</p>
        <p>comprising residual unassembled RBD-I53-50A components (Figures S1A andS1B). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and negative stain electron microscopy (nsEM) confirmed the homogeneity and monodispersity of the various RBD-I53-50 nanoparticles, both before and after freeze/thaw (Figures 1E,1F, and S1C). The average hydrodynamic diameter and percent polydispersity measured by DLS for RBD-8GS-, RBD-12GS-, and RBD-16GS-I53-50 before freeze/thaw were 38.5 (27%), 37 (21%), and 41 (27%) nm, respectively, compared to 30 (22%) nm for unmodified I53-50 nanoparticles. Hydrogen/deuterium-exchange mass spectrometry confirmed that display of the RBD on the trimeric RBD-8GS-I53-50A component preserved the conformation of the antigen and structural order of several distinct antibody epitopes (Figures 1G and S1D). Finally, we used glycoproteomics to show that all three RBD-I53-50A components were N-glycosylated at positions N331 and N343 similarly to the SARS-CoV-2 S-2P ectodomain trimer (Watanabe et al., 2020), again suggesting that the displayed antigen retained its native antigenic properties, which is key in light of the participation of glycans in the epitopes of several potent neutralizing Abs (Pinto et al., 2020;Tortorici et al., 2020) (Figures 1H and S1E).</p>
        <p>We used recombinant human ACE2 ectodomain and two S-specific mAbs (CR3022 and S309) to characterize the antigenicity of the RBD when fused to I53-50A as well as the accessibility of multiple RBD epitopes in the context of the assembled nanoparticle immunogens. CR3022 and S309 were both isolated from individuals infected with SARS-CoV and cross-react with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. CR3022 is a weakly neutralizing Ab that binds to a conserved, cryptic epitope in the RBD (site II) that becomes accessible upon opening of two neighboring RBDs but is distinct from the RBM (site I), the surface of the RBD that interacts with ACE2 (Huo et al., 2020;Piccoli et al., 2020;ter Meulen et al., 2006;Yuan et al., 2020). S309 neutralizes both SARS CoV and SARS-CoV-2 by binding to a glycan-containing epitope (site IV) that is conserved among sarbecoviruses and accessible in both the open and closed prefusion S conformational states (Pinto et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>We used biolayer interferometry (BLI) to confirm the binding affinities of the monomeric human ACE2 (hACE2) ectodomain and the CR3022 Fab for the monomeric RBD. Equilibrium disso-ciation constants (K D ) of these reagents for immobilized RBD-I53-50A fusion proteins closely matched those obtained for the monomeric RBD (Huo et al., 2020;Starr et al., 2020;Yuan et al., 2020) (Table 1; Figure S2). These data further confirm that the RBD-I53-50A fusion proteins display the RBD in its native conformation.</p>
        <p>We previously observed that the magnitude and quality of nanoparticle immunogen-elicited Ab responses can be modulated by the accessibility of specific epitopes in the context of a dense, multivalent antigen array, most likely through steric crowding (Brouwer et al., 2019). To evaluate this possibility, we measured the binding of the nanoparticle immunogens to immobilized dimeric macaque ACE2 (mACE2-Fc) and the CR3022 and S309 mAbs, the latter of which roughly mimics the B cell receptor (BCR)-antigen interaction that is central to B cell activation. This approach does not allow the calculation of K D values due to the multivalent nature of the interactions but does enable qualitative comparisons of epitope accessibility in different nanoparticles. We compared the full-valency nanoparticles displaying 60 RBDs to a less dense antigen array by leveraging the versatility of in vitro assembly to prepare nanoparticle immunogens displaying the RBD antigen at 50% valency ($30 RBDs per nanoparticle) (Figure S3). This was achieved by adding pentameric I53-50B to an equimolar mixture of RBD-I53-50A and unmodified I53-50A (lacking the fused antigen). We found that all of the RBD nanoparticles bound well to the immobilized mACE2-Fc, CR3022, and S309 (Figure 2A). Although there were no consistent trends among the 50% and 100% valency RBD-8GS-and RBD-12GS-I53-50 nanoparticles, the 100% valency RBD-16GS-I53-50 nanoparticles resulted in the highest binding signals against all three binders (Figure 2B). It is possible that the longer linker in the RBD-16GS-I53-50 nanoparticle enables better access to the epitopes targeted by ACE2, CR3022, and S309, although our data cannot rule out other possible explanations. We conclude that multiple distinct epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies are exposed and accessible for binding in the context of the RBD antigen array presented on the nanoparticle exterior.</p>

        <p>Each experiment was performed at least twice, and the values and fitting errors presented are derived from a representative experiment. The corresponding binding curves and fits are presented in Figure S2.</p>
        <p>modalities, they must meet stringent requirements related to stability during manufacture, storage, and distribution (Kumru et al., 2014). We first used chemical denaturation in guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) to compare the stability of the RBD-I53-50A fusion proteins and RBD-12GS-I53-50 nanoparticle immunogen to recombinant monomeric RBD and the S-2P ectodomain trimer (Figure 3A). Fluorescence emission spectra from samples incubated in 0-6.5 M GdnHCl revealed that all three RBD-I53-50A fusion proteins and the RBD-12GS-I53-50 nanoparticle undergo a transition between 4 and 5 M GdnHCl that indicates at least partial unfolding, whereas the S-2P trimer showed a transition at lower GdnHCl concentrations (between 2 and 4 M). The monomeric RBD exhibited a less cooperative, broad unfolding transition spanning 0 to 5 M GdnHCl. We then used a suite of analytical assays to monitor physical and antigenic stability over 4 weeks post-purification at three temperatures: &lt;Ã70 C, 2 C-8 C, and 22 C-27 C (Figures 3B-3E; Data S2). Consistent with previous reports, the monomeric RBD proved quite stable, yielding little change in appearance by SDS-PAGE (Figure S4A), mACE2-Fc and CR3022 binding (Figure S4B), or the ratio of UV/ vis absorption at 320/280 nm, a measure of particulate scattering (Figure S4C). As reported recently (Edwards et al., 2020;Hsieh et al., 2020), the S-2P trimer was unstable at 2 C-8 C, exhibiting clear signs of unfolding by 
            <rs type="software">nsEM</rs> even at early time points (Figure S3D; Data S2). Instead, S-2P maintained its structure considerably better at 22 C-27 C until the latest time point (28 days), when unfolding was apparent by 
            <rs type="software">nsEM</rs> and absorbance measurements indicated some aggregation (Figure S4C). All three RBD-I53-50A components were highly stable, exhibiting no substantial change by any readout at any time point (Data S2).
        </p>
        <p>Finally, the RBD-12GS-I53-50 nanoparticle was also stable over the 4-week study, showing changes only in UV/vis absorbance, where an unusual peak near 320 nm appeared after 7 days at 22 C-27 C, but was absent at day 28, possibly due to settling of aggregated material in unmixed samples (Data S2). Nevertheless, electron micrographs and DLS of well-mixed RBD-12GS-I53-50 nanoparticle samples consistently showed monodisperse, well-formed nanoparticles at all temperatures over the 4-week period (Figures S4D andS4E; Data S2). Collectively, these data show that the RBD-I53-50A components and the RBD-12GS-I53-50 nanoparticle have high physical and antigenic stability, superior to the S-2P ectodomain trimer.</p>
        <p>We compared the immunogenicity of the three RBD-I53-50 nanoparticles, each displaying the RBD at either 50% or 100% valency, to the S-2P ectodomain trimer and the monomeric RBD in BALB/c mice. Groups of 10 mice were immunized intramuscularly at weeks 0 and 3 with AddaVax-adjuvanted formulations containing either 0.9 or 5 mg of SARS-CoV-2 antigen in either soluble or particulate form. Three weeks post-prime, all RBD nanoparticles elicited robust S-specific Ab responses with geometric mean titers (GMTs) ranging from 8 3 10 2 and 1 3 10 4 (Figure 4A; Data S3 and S4). In contrast, the monomeric RBD and the low dose of S-2P trimer did not induce detectable levels of S-specific Abs, while the high dose of S-2P trimer elicited weak responses. Following a second immunization, we observed an enhancement of S-specific Ab titers for all 4 hospitalized patients and 26 patients that were symptomatic but not hospitalized (Data S5). Immunization with two 5 mg doses of S-2P trimer induced S-specific Ab responses $1-2 orders of magnitude weaker than the RBD nanoparticles, and the monomeric RBD did not elicit detectable antigen-specific Abs after two immunizations. As expected, we also detected an Ab response to the I53-50 scaffold, which was constant in magnitude across all RBD nanoparticle groups (Figure S5; Data S4).</p>
        <p>These data indicate that multivalent display of the RBD on a self-assembling nanoparticle scaffold markedly improves its immunogenicity.</p>
        <p>We prototyped potential human Ab responses to the RBD nanoparticle immunogens using the Kymab proprietary Intelli-Select Transgenic mouse platform (known as ''Darwin'') that is transgenic for the non-rearranged human Ab variable and constant region germline repertoire. In contrast to mice with chimeric Ab loci that have been previously described (Lee et al., 2014), the mice in the present study differed in that they were engineered to express fully human kappa light chain Abs. Groups of five Darwin mice were immunized intramuscularly with S-2P trimer, 100% RBD-12GS-I53-50, or 100% RBD-16GS-I53-50 nanoparticles at antigen doses of 0.9 mg (nanoparticles only) or 5 mg (Figure 4C). All groups immunized with RBD nanoparticles elicited S-directed Ab responses post-prime (EC 50 2 3 10 3 -1x10 4 ) that were substantially boosted by a second immunization at week 3 (EC 50 ranging from 4 3 10 5 to 8 3 10 5 ) (Figures 4C and 4D;Data S3 and S4). In this animal model, the S-2P trimer elicited levels of S-specific Abs comparable to the RBD nanoparticles after each immunization.</p>
        <p>We then evaluated the neutralizing activity elicited by each immunogen using both pseudovirus and live virus neutralization assays. In BALB/c mice, all RBD nanoparticle immunogens elicited serum neutralizing Abs after a single immunization, with reciprocal half-maximal inhibition dilutions (IC 50 ) ranging from 1 3 10 2 to 5 3 10 2 (GMT) in pseudovirus and 3 3 10 3 to 7 3 10 3 in live virus neutralization assays (Figures 5A and 5C;Data S3 and S4). No significant differences in pseudovirus or live virus neutralization were observed between low or high doses of RBD-8GS-, RBD-12GS-, or RBD-16GS-I53-50 nanoparticles at 50% (pseudovirus neutralization only) or 100% valency, in agreement with the S-specific Ab data. The GMT of all three 100% valency RBD nanoparticle groups matched or exceeded that of the panel of HCS tested in the pseudovirus neutralization assay (Figure 5A). Immunization with monomeric RBD or S-2P trimer did not elicit neutralizing Abs after a single immunization, in line with the observed lack of S-directed Ab responses and a previous study (Mandolesi et al., 2020) (Figures 5A and 5C). As in BALB/c mice, both high and low doses of the RBD-I53-50 nanoparticles in Darwin mice elicited pseudovirus neutralizing Ab titers (IC 50 8 3 10 1 to 2.5 3 10 2 ) comparable to HCS (IC 50 1 3 10 2 ) after a single immunization, whereas 5 mg of the S-2P trimer did not elicit detectable levels of neutralizing Abs (Figure 5E; Data S3) despite eliciting similar levels of total S-specific Abs.</p>
        <p>In both mouse models, a second immunization with the RBD-I53-50 nanoparticles led to a large increase in neutralizing Ab titers. In BALB/c mice, pseudovirus neutralization GMT reached 2 3 10 3 to 3 3 10 4 , exceeding that of the HCS by 1-2 orders of magnitude, and live virus neutralization titers reached 2 3 10 4 to 3 3 10 4 (Figures 5B and5D). A second immunization with 5 mg of the S-2P trimer also strongly boosted neutralizing activity, although pseudovirus and live virus neutralization GMTs (3 3 10 2 and 6 3 10 3 , respectively) were still lower than in sera from animals immunized with the RBD nanoparticles. The increases between the S-2P trimer and the RBD nanoparticles ranged from 7-to 90-fold and 4-to 9-fold in the pseudovirus and live virus neutralization assays, respectively. The 0.9 mg dose of the S-2P trimer and both doses of the monomeric RBD failed to elicit detectable neutralization activity after two immunizations. Similar increases in pseudovirus neutralization were observed after the second immunization in the Darwin mice, although the titers were lower overall than in BALB/c mice (Figure 5F; Data S3). These results are consistent with the derivation of Darwin mice from the 129S7 and C57BL/6J genetic background (Lee et al., 2014), the latter of which has previously been shown to generate lower magnitude humoral responses compared to immunization of BALB/c mice (Corbett et al., 2020). Several conclusions can be drawn from these data. First, the RBD nanoparticles elicit potent neutralizing Ab responses in two mouse models that exceed those elicited by the prefusion-stabilized S-2P trimer and, after two doses, by infection in humans. Second, linker length and antigen valency did not substantially impact the overall immunogenicity of the RBD nanoparticles, although there is a trend suggesting that RBD-16GS-I53-50 may be more immunogenic than the nanoparticles with shorter linkers. These observations are consistent with the antigenicity and accessibility data presented in Table 1 and Figure 2 showing that multiple epitopes are intact and accessible in all RBD nanoparticle immunogens. Finally, the elicitation of comparable neutralizing Ab titers by both the 0.9 and 5 mg doses of each nanoparticle immunogen suggests that RBD presentation on the I53-50 nanoparticle enables dose sparing, which is a key consideration for vaccine manufacturing and distribution.</p>
        <p>Eight mice immunized with AddaVax only, monomeric RBD, S-2P trimer, or RBD-8GS-or RBD-12GS-I53-50 nanoparticles were challenged 7 weeks post-boost with a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus (SARS-CoV-2 MA) to determine whether these immunogens confer protection from viral replication (Dinnon et al., 2020a). The RBD-8GS-and RBD-12GS-I53-50 nanoparticles provided complete protection from detectable SARS-CoV-2 MA replication in mouse lung and nasal turbinates (Figures 5G and5H). Immunization with the monomeric RBD, 0.9 mg S-2P trimer, and adjuvant control did not protect from SARS-CoV-2 MA replication. These results mirrored our pseudovirus and live virus neutralization data showing that the RBD nanoparticles induce potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ab responses at either dose or valency.</p>
        <p>Responses and Abs Targeting Multiple Epitopes in Mice and a Nonhuman Primate Germinal center (GC) responses are a key process in the formation of durable B cell memory, resulting in the formation of affinity-matured, class-switched memory B cells and longlived plasma cells. We therefore evaluated the antigen-specific GC B cell responses in mice immunized with the monomeric RBD, S-2P trimer, and RBD-8GS-, RBD-12GS-, or RBD-16GS-I53-50 nanoparticles. The quantity and phenotype of RBD-specific B cells were assessed 11 days after immunization to determine levels of GC precursors and B cells (B220 + CD3 -CD138 -CD38 -GL7 + ) (Figure S6A). Immunization with RBD nanoparticles resulted in an expansion of RBD-specific B cells and GC precursors and B cells (Figures 6A-6C). The S-2P trimer resulted in a detectable but lower number and frequency of RBD-specific B cells and GC precursors and B cells compared to the RBD nanoparticles, whereas the monomeric RBD did not elicit an appreciable B cell response. Consistent with these findings, immunization with the three RBD nanoparticles and trimeric S-2P led to the emergence of CD38 +/-GL7 + IgM + and class-switched (swIg + ) RBD-specific B cells, indicative of functional GC precursors and GC B cells (Figure 6D). The robust GC B cell responses and increased proportions of IgM + and swIg + RBD-specific B cells in the mice immunized with the RBD nanoparticles and, to a lesser extent, S-2P trimer is consistent with an ongoing GC reaction, which in time should result in the formation of memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells. To evaluate the durability of humoral responses elicited by the RBD nanoparticle vaccines, we analyzed serum Ab responses 20-24 weeks post-boost. The magnitude of both binding and neutralization titers were similar to their levels two weeks post-boost for all nanoparticle groups (Figures S6B andS6C), indicating that the designed immunogens elicit not only potent but also durable neutralizing Abs. This is likely due in part to improved induction of long-lived plasma cells by the nanoparticle vaccines, as the number of S-2P-specific Ab secreting cells in the bone marrow was $3-fold higher for mice immunized with the RBD-16GS-I53-50 nanoparticle compared to the S-2P trimer (Figure S6D).</p>
        <p>We compared the ratio of binding to neutralizing Abs elicited by S-2P and the RBD-8GS-, RBD-12GS-, and RBD-16GS-I53-50 nanoparticles and HCS as a measure of the quality of the Ab responses elicited by the nanoparticle immunogens (Graham, 2020). In Kymab Darwin mice, the nanoparticle vaccines had lower (better) ratios than S-2P-immunized mice but higher than HCS (Figure 6E). In BALB/c mice, the ratio of binding to pseudovirus neutralizing titers elicited by RBD-12GS-and RBD-16GS-I53-50 was clearly decreased compared to S-2P and HCS (Figure 6F). This pattern was consistent when ratios were calculated using live virus neutralizing titers, although the magnitude of the differences between groups were smaller due to the high values obtained in the live virus neutralization assay. These results suggest the Ab responses elicited by the RBD-12GS-and RBD-16GS-I53-50 nanoparticle immunogens are of higher quality than that obtained from immunization with the S-2P trimer or acquired during natural infection, perhaps because it is focused on epitopes in the RBD that are the target of most neutralizing Abs (Piccoli et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>We set out to identify the epitopes recognized by Abs elicited upon immunization with the nanoparticle immunogens in a nonhuman primate model that more closely resembles humans in their immune response to vaccination. We immunized a pigtail macaque with 250 mg of RBD-12GS-I53-50 (88 mg of RBD antigen) at weeks 0 and 4 and found that serum collected at week 8 had high levels of S-specific Abs (EC 50 $1 3 10 6 ) and pseudovirus neutralizing Abs (IC 50 9 3 10 2 ). Polyclonal Fabs were generated and purified for use in competition BLI with hACE2, CR3022, and S309, which recognize three distinct sites targeted by neutralizing Abs on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Figure 6G) (Barnes et al., 2020;Huo et al., 2020;Piccoli et al., 2020;Pinto et al., 2020;Yuan et al., 2020;Zhou et al., 2020a). The polyclonal sera inhibited binding of hACE2, CR3022 Fab, and S309 Fab at concentrations above their respective dissociation constants in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 6H-6J). These data indicate that immunization with RBD-12GS-I53-50 elicited Abs targeting several non-overlapping epitopes, including antigenic sites I, II, and IV (Piccoli et al., 2020). Although we did not test for competition with Abs targeting all known neutralizing epitopes, we expect the multiple Ab specificities elicited by the RBD nanoparticles to limit the potential for emergence and selection of escape mutants, especially since coronaviruses do not mutate quickly when compared to viruses such as influenza or HIV (Li et al., 2020b;Smith et al., 2014).</p>
        <p>A wide variety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates spanning diverse vaccine modalities are currently in preclinical or clinical development. Multivalent antigen presentation on self-assembling protein scaffolds is being increasingly explored in clinical vaccine development, largely due to the availability of robust platforms that enable the display of complex antigens, including oligomeric viral glycoproteins (Irvine and Read, 2020;Kanekiyo et al., 2019a;Lo Â´pez-Sagaseta et al., 2015). Such nanoparticle vaccines often significantly enhance neutralizing Ab responses compared to traditional subunit vaccines based on non-particulate antigens (Kanekiyo et al., 2013;2015;Marcandalli et al., 2019). While preclinical and early clinical development of subunit vaccines is slower than nucleic acid and vector-based vaccines, multiple intrinsic advantages of nanoparticle vaccines strongly motivate their prioritization in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development efforts. These advantages include the potential to induce potent neutralizing Ab responses, the ability to use existing worldwide capacity for manufacturing recombinant proteins, and an established regulatory track record.</p>
        <p>Here, we showed that two-component self-assembling SARS-CoV-2 RBD nanoparticle vaccine candidates elicit potent neutralizing Ab responses targeting multiple distinct RBD epitopes. Although comparing vaccine candidates across studies from different groups is complicated by variations in serological assays, experimental design, and many other factors, the greater neutralizing Ab responses elicited by the RBD nanoparticles compared to the prefusion-stabilized S ectodomain trimer are very promising. One of the few other studies that benchmarked vaccine immunogenicity against the S-2P trimer delivered as recombinant protein was a recent preclinical evaluation of mRNA-1273 in mice (Corbett et al., 2020). At the highest dose tested (1 mg), two immunizations with mRNA-1273 elicited comparable levels of S-specific Abs to two immunizations with 1 mg of S-2P trimer formulated in an adjuvant containing a TLR4 agonist. Additional reports of potent neutralizing activity obtained by immunization with prefusion-stabilized S(Ã2P) ectodomain (Mandolesi et al., 2020) and full-length trimers (Keech et al., 2020) formulated with powerful adjuvants provide promising data on the immunogenicity of vaccine candidates based on recombinant S proteins. Our data indicate that RBD-12GS-I53-50 and RBD-16GS-I53-50 elicit nearly 10-fold higher levels of S-specific Abs and, more importantly, roughly 10-fold higher levels of neutralizing activity compared to the S-2P ectodomain trimer. This enhancement in potency is maintained at a more than 5-fold lower antigen dose by mass, suggesting that presentation on the nanoparticle also has a dose-sparing effect. Both enhanced potency and dose-sparing could be critical for addressing the need to manufacture an unprecedented number of doses of vaccine to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
        <p>Several recent studies have indicated that the RBD is the target of most neutralizing activity in COVID-19 HCS (Barnes et al., 2020;Brouwer et al., 2020;Piccoli et al., 2020;Pinto et al., 2020;Robbiani et al., 2020;Seydoux et al., 2020;Wang et al., 2020a;Wu et al., 2020). Although the RBD is poorly immunogenic as a monomer, our data establish that it can form the basis of a highly immunogenic vaccine when presented multivalently. This conclusion is consistent with a recent report of dimerization increasing the immunogenicity of the RBD from several coronavirus S proteins, including SARS-CoV-2 S (Dai et al., 2020), as well as a nanoparticle vaccine candidate for Epstein-Barr virus conceptually similar to our RBD nanoparticle immunogens that displayed the CR2-binding domain of gp350 (Kanekiyo et al., 2015). The exceptionally low binding:neutralizing ratio elicited upon immunization with the RBD nanoparticles suggests that presentation of the RBD on I53-50 focuses the humoral response on epitopes recognized by neutralizing Abs. This metric has been identified as a potentially important indicator of vaccine safety, as high levels of binding yet nonneutralizing or weakly neutralizing Abs may contribute to vac-cine-associated enhancement of respiratory disease (Graham, 2020;Kim et al., 1969;Polack et al., 2002). Our data further show that RBD-12GS-I53-50 elicited Ab responses targeting several of the non-overlapping RBD antigenic sites recognized by neutralizing Abs (Piccoli et al., 2020). As several naturally occurring RBD mutations identified among circulating SARS-CoV-2 isolates were shown to abrogate interactions with known monoclonal Abs and to reduce immune sera binding (Li et al., 2020a), formulation of potent Ab cocktails was proposed to overcome immune evasion (Baum et al., 2020;Hansen et al., 2020;Tortorici et al., 2020). Accordingly, the diverse polyclonal Ab responses elicited by the RBD-12GS-I53-50 nanoparticle, targeting multiple distinct epitopes, might explain the magnitude of neutralization observed and should minimize the risk of selection or emergence of escape mutations (Davis et al., 2018;Lee et al., 2019). Finally, the high production yield of RBD-I53-50A components and the robust stability of the antigen-bearing RBD nanoparticles suggests that these will likely be more amenable to large-scale manufacturing than the SARS-CoV-2 S-2P trimer, which expresses poorly and is unstable (Edwards et al., 2020;Hsieh et al., 2020;McCallum et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>The emergence of three highly pathogenic zoonotic coronaviruses in the past two decades showcases that vaccines capable of providing broad protection against coronaviruses are urgently needed for future pandemic preparedness. As viruses similar to SARS-CoV (Menachery et al., 2015), MERS-CoV (Anthony et al., 2017;Woo et al., 2006), and SARS-CoV-2 (Zhou et al., 2020b;2020c) have been found in animal reservoirs, the potential for the emergence of similar viruses in the future poses a significant threat to global public health. The RBD nanoparticle vaccines described here are not expected to provide protection against distantly related coronaviruses (e.g., MERS-CoV) due to substantial sequence variation among the RBDs of coronavirus S glycoproteins. However, the potent neutralizing Ab responses elicited by the nanoparticle immunogens combined with recent work demonstrating that co-displaying multiple antigens on the same nanoparticle can improve the breadth of vaccine-elicited immune responses (Boyoglu-Barnum et al., 2020;Kanekiyo et al., 2019b) suggests a potential route to broader coronavirus vaccines. Alternatively, optimizing the expression, stability, and multivalent display of prefusion S ectodomain trimers may lead to elicitation of even broader Ab responses based on the greater sequence and structural conservation of the S 2 subunit (i.e., the fusion machinery) among coronaviruses (Walls et al., 2016a;2020) and the fact that it contains conserved epitopes that are targeted by neutralizing Abs such as the fusion peptide (Poh et al., 2020). Several reports of stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 S variants provide promising antigens that can be used to test this hypothesis (Henderson et al., 2020;Hsieh et al., 2020;McCallum et al., 2020;Xiong et al., 2020). Although a single approach may be enough for generating protective responses against multiple closely related coronaviruses (e.g., sarbecoviruses), the genetic diversity across lineages and genera will likely necessitate a combination of several vaccine design approaches.</p>
        <p>Here, we leveraged the robustness and versatility of computationally designed two-component nanoparticles to rapidly generate promising SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates that are highly differentiated from many other candidates under development. Our results add another class I fusion protein to the growing list of antigens whose immunogenicity is enhanced through multivalent presentation on two-component nanoparticles. Continued development of such technology platforms could lead to vaccines that prevent the next pandemic rather than respond to it (Kanekiyo et al., 2019a;Kanekiyo and Graham, 2020).</p>
        <p>Detailed methods are provided in the online version of this paper and include the following: mu-phosphatase signal peptide and a C-terminal octa-histidine tag. The macaque or human ACE2 ectodomain was genetically fused to a sequence encoding a thrombin cleavage site and a human Fc fragment at the C-terminal end. hACE2-Fc was synthesized and cloned by GenScript with a BM40 signal peptide. Plasmids were transformed into the NEB 5-alpha strain of E. coli (New England Biolabs) for subsequent DNA extraction from bacterial culture (NucleoBond Xtra Midi kit) to obtain plasmid for transient transfection into Expi293F cells. The amino acid sequences of all novel proteins used in this study can be found in Data S1.</p>
        <p>Transient transfection SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2-Fc proteins were produced in Expi293F cells grown in suspension using Expi293F expression medium (Life Technologies) at 33 C, 70% humidity, 8% CO 2 rotating at 150 rpm. The cultures were transfected using PEI-MAX (Polyscience) with cells grown to a density of 3.0 million cells per mL and cultivated for 3 days. Supernatants were clarified by centrifugation (5 min at 4000 rcf), addition of PDADMAC solution to a final concentration of 0.0375% (Sigma Aldrich, #409014), and a second spin (5 min at 4000 rcf).</p>
        <p>Genes encoding CR3022 heavy and light chains were ordered from GenScript and cloned into pCMV/R. Antibodies were expressed by transient co-transfection of both heavy and light chain plasmids in Expi293F cells using PEI MAX (Polyscience) transfection reagent. Cell supernatants were harvested and clarified after 3 or 6 days as described above.</p>
        <p>Proteins containing His tags were purified from clarified supernatants via a batch bind method where each clarified supernatant was supplemented with 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0 to a final concentration of 45 mM and 5 M NaCl to a final concentration of $310 mM. Talon cobalt affinity resin (Takara) was added to the treated supernatants and allowed to incubate for 15 min with gentle shaking. Resin was collected using vacuum filtration with a 0.2 mm filter and transferred to a gravity column. The resin was washed with 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, and the protein was eluted with 3 column volumes of 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole. The batch bind process was then repeated and the first and second elutions combined. SDS-PAGE was used to assess purity. RBD-I53-50A fusion protein IMAC elutions were concentrated to &gt; 1 mg/mL and subjected to three rounds of dialysis into 50 mM Tris pH 7, 185 mM NaCl, 100 mM Arginine, 4.5% glycerol, and 0.75% w/v 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) in a hydrated 10K molecular weight cutoff dialysis cassette (Thermo Scientific). S-2P IMAC elution fractions were concentrated to $1 mg/mL and dialyzed three times into 50 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.25% L-Histidine in a hydrated 10K molecular weight cutoff dialysis cassette (Thermo Scientific). Due to inherent instability, the S-2P trimer was immediately flash frozen and stored at Ã80 C.</p>
        <p>Clarified supernatants of cells expressing monoclonal antibodies and human or macaque ACE2-Fc were purified using a MabSelect PrismA 2.6 3 5 cm column (Cytiva) on an AKTA Avant150 FPLC (Cytiva). Bound antibodies were washed with five column volumes of 20 mM NaPO 4 , 150 mM NaCl pH 7.2, then five column volumes of 20 mM NaPO 4 , 1 M NaCl pH 7.4 and eluted with three column volumes of 100 mM glycine at pH 3.0. The eluate was neutralized with 2 M Trizma base to 50 mM final concentration. SDS-PAGE was used to assess purity.</p>
        <p>Recombinant S309 was expressed as a Fab in expiCHO cells transiently co-transfected with plasmids expressing the heavy and light chain, as described above (see Transient transfection) (Stettler et al., 2016). The protein was affinity-purified using a HiTrap Protein A Mab select Xtra column (Cytiva) followed by desalting against 20 mM NaPO 4 , 150 mM NaCl pH 7.2 using a HiTrap Fast desalting column (Cytiva). The protein was sterilized with a 0.22 mm filter and stored at 4 C until use.</p>
        <p>The I53-50A and I53-50B.4.PT1 proteins were expressed in Lemo21(DE3) (NEB) in LB (10 g Tryptone, 5 g Yeast Extract, 10 g NaCl) grown in 2 L baffled shake flasks or a 10 L BioFlo 320 Fermenter (Eppendorf). Cells were grown at 37 C to an OD600 $0.8, and then induced with 1 mM IPTG. Expression temperature was reduced to 18 C and the cells shaken for $16 h. The cells were harvested and lysed by microfluidization using a Microfluidics M110P at 18,000 psi in 50 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, 1 mM PMSF, 0.75% CHAPS. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 24,000 g for 30 min and applied to a 2.6 3 10 cm Ni Sepharose 6 FF column (Cytiva) for purification by IMAC on an AKTA Avant150 FPLC system (Cytiva). Protein of interest was eluted over a linear gradient of 30 mM to 500 mM imidazole in a background of 50 mM Tris pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 0.75% CHAPS buffer. Peak fractions were pooled, concentrated in 10K MWCO centrifugal filters (Millipore), sterile filtered (0.22 mm) and applied to either a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300, or HiLoad S200 pg GL SEC column (Cytiva) using 50 mM Tris pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 0.75% CHAPS buffer. I53-50A elutes at $0.6 column volume (CV). I53-50B.4PT1 elutes at $0.45 CV. After sizing, bacterial-derived components were tested to confirm low levels of endotoxin before using for nanoparticle assembly.</p>
        <p>In vitro nanoparticle assembly Total protein concentration of purified individual nanoparticle components was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm using a UV/vis spectrophotometer (Agilent Cary 8454) and calculated extinction coefficients (Gasteiger et al., 2005). The assembly steps were performed at room temperature with addition in the following order: RBD-I53-50A trimeric fusion protein, followed by additional buffer as needed to achieve desired final concentration, and finally I53-50B.4PT1 pentameric component (in 50 mM Tris pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 0.75% w/v CHAPS), with a molar ratio of RBD-I53-50A:I53-B.4PT1 of 1.1:1. In order to produce partial valency RBD-I53-50 nanoparticles (50% RBD-I53-50), both RBD-I53-50A and unmodified I53-50A trimers (in 50 mM Tris pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 0.75% w/v CHAPS) were added in a slight molar excess (1.1 3 ) to I53-50B.4PT1. All RBD-I53-50 in vitro assemblies were incubated at 2-8 C with gentle rocking for at least 30 min before subsequent purification by SEC in order to remove residual unassembled component. Different columns were utilized depending on purpose: Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column was used analytically for nanoparticle size estimation, a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column used for small-scale pilot assemblies, and a HiLoad 26/600 Superdex 200 pg column used for nanoparticle production. Assembled particles elute at $11 mL on the Superose 6 column and in the void volume of Superdex 200 columns. Assembled nanoparticles were sterile filtered (0.22 mm) immediately prior to column application and following pooling of fractions.</p>

The reaction was incubated at ambient temperature for 16-18 h with gentle rocking. Following incubation, the reaction mixture was concentrated using Ultracel 10K centrifugal filters (Millipore Amicon Ultra) and sterile filtered (0.22 mM). Cleaved hACE2 monomer was separated from uncleaved hACE2-Fc and the cleaved Fc regions using Protein A purification (see Protein purification above) on a HiScreen MabSelect SuRe column (Cytiva) using an ÓKTA avant 25 FPLC (Cytiva).

Monomeric hACE2 and CR3022 Fab were diluted to 750 nM in Kinetics buffer and serially diluted three-fold for a final concentration of 3.1 nM. Reagents were applied to a black 96-well Greiner Bio-one microplate at 200 mL per well as described below. RBD-I53-50A components or monomeric RBD were immobilized onto Anti-Penta-HIS (HIS1K) biosensors per manufacturer instructions (Forte Â´Bio) except using the following sensor incubation times.

        <p>Negative stain electron microscopy RBD-I53-50 nanoparticles were first diluted to 75 mg/mL in 50 mM Tris pH 7, 185 mM NaCl, 100 mM Arginine, 4.5% v/v Glycerol, 0.75% w/v CHAPS, and S-2P protein was diluted to 0.03 mg/mL in 50 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.25% L-Histidine prior to application of 3 mL of sample onto freshly glow-discharged 300-mesh copper grids. Sample was incubated on the grid for 1 min before the grid was dipped in a 50 mL droplet of water and excess liquid blotted away with filter paper (Whatman). The grids were then dipped into 6 mL of 0.75% w/v uranyl formate stain. Stain was blotted off with filter paper, then the grids were dipped into another 6 mL of stain and incubated for $70 s. Finally, the stain was blotted away and the grids were allowed to dry for 1 min. Prepared grids were imaged in a Talos model L120C electron microscope at 45,000 3 (nanoparticles) or 92,000 3 magnification (S-2P).</p>
        <p>Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) was used to measure hydrodynamic diameter (Dh) and % Polydispersity (%Pd) of RBD-I53-50 nanoparticle samples on an UNcle Nano-DSF (UNchained Laboratories). Sample was applied to a 8.8 mL quartz capillary cassette (UNi, HexNAc(6)X as A4/A3B subtype. Hybrid and Complex forms with fucosylation are separately listed as FHybrid and FComplex (e.g., FA1), respectively (Watanabe et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>Glycan occupancy analysis and glycoform determination of the four RBD variants were performed by LC-MS on the Synapt G2-Si TM TOF mass spectrometer coupled to an Acquity UPLC system (Waters). Samples were resolved over a Waters CSH C18 1 3 100 mm 1.7 mm column with a linear gradient from 3% to 40% B over 30 min (A: 98% water, 2% acetonitrile, 0.1% FA; B: 100% acetonitrile, 0.1% FA). Data dependent acquisition (DDA) method was utilized with precursor mass range 300-2000, MS/MS mass range 50-2000 and a collision energy ramped from 70 to 100 V. Chromatographic peaks for the most abundant and non-overlapped isotopic peaks were determined and integrated with MassLynx (Waters). All the water and organic solvents used, unless specifically stated, were MS grade (Optima TM , Fisher). The peak area ratio of the non-glycosylated (Asn) to the deglycosylated (Asp) glycopeptide was used to measure the glycan occupancy at each site.</p>
        <p>Hydrogen/Deuterium-exchange mass spectrometry 3 mg of monomeric RBD and RBD-8GS-I53-50A were incubated and H/D exchanged (HDX) in the deuteration buffer (pH* 7.6, 85% D 2 O, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.) for 3, 60, 1800, and 72000 s, respectively, at 23 C. Samples were subsequently mixed 1:1 with ice-cold quench buffer (200 mM tris(2-chlorethyl) phosphate (TCEP), 8 M Urea, 0.2% formic acid) for a final pH 2.5 and immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were analyzed by LC-MS on a Synapt G2-Si mass spectrometer using a custom built cooling box to maintain all columns, loops, valves, and lines at 0 C. Quenched samples were loaded over a custom packed immobilized pepsin column (2.1 3 50 mm) with a flow of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid with 2% acetonitrile at 200 mL/min. Peptides were trapped on a Waters CSH C18 trap cartridge (2.1 3 5 mm) and resolved over a Waters CSH C18 1 3 100 mm 1.7 mm column with a linear gradient from 3% to 40% B over 18 min (A: 98% water, 2% acetonitrile, 0.1% FA, 0.025% trifluoroacetic acid; B: 100% acetonitrile, 0.1% FA, flow rate of 40 mL/min). A series of washes steps were performed between all samples to minimize carryover (Verkerke et al., 2016). A fully deuteration control was made by collecting the pepsin digest eluate from an undeuterated sample LC-MS run, drying by speedvac, incubating in deuteration buffer for 1 h at 85 C, and quenching the same as all other HDX samples. Internal exchange standards (Pro-Pro-Pro-Ile [PPPI] and Pro-Pro-Pro-Phe [PPPF]) were added in each sample to ensure consistent labeling conditions for all samples (Zhang et al., 2012). Pepsin digests for undeuterated samples were also analyzed by nano LC-MS using an Orbitrap Fusion TM mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) with the settings as described above for glycoprofiling. The data was then processed by Byonic TM to obtain the peptide reference list. Peptides were manually validated using DriftScope TM (Waters) and identified with orthogonal retention time (rt) and drift time (dt) coordinates. Deuterium uptake analysis was performed with HX-Express v2 (Guttman et al., 2013;Weis et al., 2006). Peaks were identified from the peptide spectra with binomial fitting applied. The deuterium uptake level was normalized relative to fully deuterated standards.</p>
        <p>Female BALB/c (Stock: 000651) mice were purchased at the age of four weeks from The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, and maintained at the Comparative Medicine Facility at the University of Washington, Seattle, WA, accredited by the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC). At six weeks of age, 10 mice per dosing group were vaccinated with a prime immunization, and three weeks later mice were boosted with a second vaccination. Prior to inoculation, immunogen suspensions were gently mixed 1:1 vol/vol with AddaVax adjuvant (Invivogen, San Diego, CA) to reach a final concentration of 0.009 or 0.05 mg/mL antigen. Mice were injected intramuscularly into the gastrocnemius muscle of each hind leg using a 27-gauge needle (BD, San Diego, CA) with 50 mL per injection site (100 mL total) of immunogen under isoflurane anesthesia. To obtain sera all mice were bled two weeks after prime and boost immunizations. Blood was collected via submental venous puncture and rested in 1.5 mL plastic Eppendorf tubes at room temperature for 30 min to allow for coagulation. Serum was separated from hematocrit via centrifugation at 2,000 g for 10 min. Complement factors and pathogens in isolated serum were heat-inactivated via incubation at 56 C for 60 min. Serum was stored at 4 C or Ã80 C until use. Six weeks post-boost, mice were exported from Comparative Medicine Facility at the University of Washington, Seattle, WA to an AAALAC accredited Animal Biosafety Level 3 (ABSL3) Laboratory at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. After a 7-day acclimation time, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine/xylazine and challenged intranasally with 10 5 plaque-forming units (pfu) of mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 MA strain for the evaluation of vaccine efficacy (IACUC protocol 20-114.0). After infection, body weight was monitored daily until the termination of the study two days post-infection, when lung and nasal turbinate tissues were harvested to evaluate the viral load by plaque assay. All experiments were conducted at the University of Washington, Seattle, WA, and University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC according to approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocols.</p>
        <p>Kymab Darwin mice (a mix of males and females, 10 weeks of age), 5 mice per dosing group, were vaccinated with a prime immunization and three weeks later boosted with a second vaccination. Prior to inoculation, immunogen suspensions were gently mixed 1:1 vol/vol with AddaVax adjuvant (Invivogen) to reach a final concentration of 0.009 or 0.05 mg/mL antigen. Mice were injected intramuscularly into the tibialis muscle of each hind leg using a 30-gauge needle (BD) with 20 mL per injection site (40 mL total) of immunogen under isoflurane anesthesia. A final boost was administered intravenously (50 uL) with no adjuvant at week 7. Mice were sacrificed 5 days later under UK Home Office Schedule 1 (rising concentration of CO 2 ) and spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow cryopreserved. Whole blood (0.1 ml) was collected 2 weeks after each dose (weeks 0, 2, 5, and week 8 terminal bleed). Serum was separated from hematocrit via centrifugation at 2000 g for 10 min. Serum was stored at Ã20 C and was used to monitor titers by ELISA. All mice were maintained and all procedures carried out under United Kingdom Home Office License 70/8718 and with the approval of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body.</p>

        <p>MLV-based SARS-CoV-2 S, SARS-CoV S, and WIV-1 pseudotypes were prepared as previously described (Millet and Whittaker, 2016;Walls et al., 2020). Briefly, HEK293T cells were co-transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) with an S-encoding plasmid, an MLV Gag-Pol packaging construct, and the MLV transfer vector encoding a luciferase reporter according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were washed 3 3 with Opti-MEM and incubated for 5 h at 37 C with transfection medium. DMEM containing 10% FBS was added for 60 h. The supernatants were harvested by spinning at 2,500 g, filtered through a 0.45 mm filter, concentrated with a 100 kDa membrane for 10 min at 2,500 g and then aliquoted and stored at Ã80 C.</p>
        <p>Pseudovirus entry and serum neutralization assays HEK-hACE2 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS (Hyclone) and 1% PenStrep with 8% CO 2 in a 37 C incubator (ThermoFisher). One day prior to infection, 40 mL of poly-lysine (Sigma) was placed into 96-well plates and incubated with rotation for 5 min. Poly-lysine was removed, plates were dried for 5 min then washed 1 3 with DMEM prior to plating cells. The following day, cells were checked to be at 80% confluence. In a half-area 96-well plate a 1:3 serial dilution of sera was made in DMEM starting between 1:3 and 1:66 initial dilution in 22 mL final volume. 22 mL of pseudovirus was then added to the serial dilution and incubated at room temperature for 30-60 min. HEK-hACE2 plate media was removed and 40 mL of the sera/virus mixture was added to the cells and incubated for 2 h at 37 C with 8% CO 2 . Following incubation, 40 mL 20% FBS and 2% PenStrep containing DMEM was added to the cells for 48 h. Following the 48-h infection, One-Glo-EX (Promega) was added to the cells in half culturing volume (40 mL added) and incubated in the dark for 5 min prior to reading on a Varioskan LUX plate reader (ThermoFisher). Measurements were done on all ten mouse sera samples from each group in at least duplicate. Relative luciferase units were plotted and normalized in

            <rs type="creator">GraphPad</rs>) using a zero value of cells alone and a 100% value of 1:2 virus alone. Nonlinear regression of log(inhibitor) versus normalized response was used to determine IC 50 values from curve fits. Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare two groups to determine whether they were statistically different.

        <p>Live virus production SARS-CoV-2-nanoLuc virus (WA1 strain) in which ORF7 was replaced by nanoluciferase gene (nanoLuc), and mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 MA) (Dinnon et al., 2020b) were generated by the coronavirus reverse genetics system described previously (Hou et al., 2020). Recombinant viruses were generated in Vero E6 cells (ATCC-CRL1586) grown in DMEM high glucose media (GIBCO #11995065) supplemented with 10% Hyclone Fetal Clone II (GE #SH3006603HI), 1% non-essential amino acid, and 1% Pen/Strep in a 37 C +5% CO 2 incubator. To generate recombinant SARS-CoV-2, seven DNA fragments which collectively encode the full-length genome of SARS-CoV-2 flanked by a 5Â¿ T7 promoter and a 3Â¿ polyA tail were ligated and transcribed in vitro. The transcribed RNA was electroporated into Vero E6 cells to generate a P0 virus stock. The seed virus was amplified twice in Vero E6 cells at low moi for 48 h to create a working stock which was titered by plaque assay (Hou et al., 2020). All the live virus experiments, including the ligation and electroporation steps, were performed under biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) conditions at negative pressure, by operators in Tyvek suits wearing personal powered-air purifying respirators.</p>
        <p>Luciferase-based serum neutralization assay, SARS-CoV-2-nanoLuc Vero E6 cells were seeded at 2x10 4 cells/well in a 96-well plate 24 h before the assay. One hundred pfu of SARS-CoV-2-nanoLuc virus (Hou et al., 2020) were mixed with serum at 1:1 ratio and incubated at 37 C for 1 h. An 8-point, 3-fold dilution curve was generated for each sample with starting concentration at 1:20 (standard) or 1:2000 (high neutralizer). Virus and serum mix was added to each well and incubated at 37 C + 5% CO 2 for 48 h. Luciferase activities were measured by Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega, WI) following manufacturer protocol using SpectraMax M3 luminometer (Molecular Device). Percent inhibition and 50% inhibition concentration (IC 50 ) were calculated by the following equation: [1-(RLU with sample/ RLU with mock treatment)] 3 100%. Fifty percent inhibition titer (IC 50 ) was calculated in

        <p>Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 trimeric Spike was biotinylated using the EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC Biotinylation Kit (ThermoFisher). The biotinylated protein was then incubated with differing amounts of streptavidin-PE (Prozyme) and probed with SA-AF680 (Invitrogen) to determine the ratio of biotin to streptavidin at which there was excess biotin available for SA-AF680 to bind. This ratio was used to determine the concentration of biotinylated Spike protein, allowing for the calculation the amount of SA-PE required to create a 6:1 ratio of Spike to SA-PE. The biotinylated Spike was incubated with SA-APC for 30 min at room temperature and purified on a Sephacryl S-300 size exclusion column, and the tetramer fraction was centrifuged in a 100-kD molecular weight cutoff Amicon Ultra filter (Millipore). The tetramer concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance of APC at 650 nM. The RBD domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein was biotinylated and tetramerized with SA-PE in the same manner, and the concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance of PE at 565 nM. The APC decoy reagent was generated by conjugating SA-APC to Dylight 755 using a DyLight 755 antibody labeling kit (ThermoFisher), washing and removing unbound DyLight 755, and incubating with excess of an irrelevant biotinylated His-tagged protein. The PE decoy was generated in the same manner, by conjugating SA-PE to Alexa Fluor 647 with an AF647 antibody labeling kit (ThermoFisher).</p>
        <p>For phenotyping of B cells, 6-week old female BALB/c mice, three per dosing group, were immunized intramuscularly with 50 mL per injection site of vaccine formulations containing 5 mg of SARS-CoV-2 antigen (either S-2P trimer or RBD, but not including mass from the I53-50 nanoparticle) mixed 1:1 vol/vol with AddaVax adjuvant on day 0. All experimental mice were euthanized for harvesting of inguinal and popliteal lymph nodes on day 11. The experiment was repeated two times. Popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes were collected and pooled for individual mice. Cell suspensions were prepared by mashing lymph nodes and filtering through 100 mM Nitex mesh. Cells were resuspended in PBS containing 2% FBS and Fc block (2.4G2), and were incubated with 10 nM Decoy tetramers at room temperature for 20 min. RBD-PE tetramer and Spike-APC tetramer were added at a concentration of 10 nM and incubated on ice for 20 min. Cells were washed, incubated with anti-PE and anti-APC magnetic beads on ice for 30 min, then passed over magnetized LS columns (Miltenyi Biotec). Bound B cells were stained with anti-mouse B220 (BUV737), CD3 (PerCP-Cy5.5), CD138 (BV650), CD38 (Alexa Fluor 700), GL7 (eFluor 450), IgM (BV786), IgD (BUV395), CD73 (PE-Cy7), and CD80 (BV605) on ice for 20 min.

        <p>A Pigtail macaque was immunized with 250 mg of RBD-12GS-I53-50 nanoparticle (88 mg RBD antigen) at day 0 and day 28. Blood was collected at days 0, 10, 14, 28, 42, and 56 days post-prime. Blood was collected in serum collection tubes and allowed to clot at room temperature. Serum was isolated after a 15 min spin at 1455 x g for 15 min and stored at Ã80C until use. Prior to vaccination or blood collection, animals were sedated with an intramuscular injection (10 mg/kg) of ketamine (KetasetÃ¢; Henry Schein). Prior to inoculation, immunogen suspensions were gently mixed 1:1 vol/vol with AddaVax adjuvant (Invivogen, San Diego, CA) to reach a final concentration of 0.250 mg/mL antigen. The vaccine was delivered intramuscularly into both quadriceps muscles with 1 mL per injection site on days 0 and 28. All injection sites were shaved prior to injection. Animals were observed daily for general health (activity and appetite, urine/feces output) and for evidence of reactogenicity at the vaccine inoculation site (swelling, erythema, and pruritus) for up to 1 week following vaccination. They also received physical exams including temperature and weight measurements at each study time point. None of the animals became severely ill during the course of the study nor required euthanasia.</p>
        <p>Purification of Fabs from NHP serum was adapted from (Boyoglu-Barnum et al., 2020). Briefly, 1mL of day 56 serum was diluted to 10 mL with PBS and incubated with 1 mL of 3 3 PBS washed protein A beads (GenScript) with agitation overnight at 37 C. The next day beads were thoroughly washed with PBS using a gravity flow column and bound antibodies were eluted with 0.1 M glycine pH 3.5 into 1M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) to a final concentration of 100 mM. Serum and early washes that flowed through were re-bound to beads overnight again for a second, repeat elution. IgGs were concentrated (Amicon 30 kDa) and buffer exchanged into PBS. 2 3 digestion buffer (40 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.5, 20 mM EDTA, 40 mM cysteine) was added to concentrated and pooled IgGs. 500 mL of resuspended immobilized papain resin (ThermoFisher Scientific) freshly washed in 1 3 digestion buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM EDTA, 20 mM cysteine, pH 6.5) was added to purified IgGs in 2 3 digestion buffer and samples were agitated for 5 h at 37 C. The supernatant was separated from resin and resin washes were collected and pooled with the resin flow through. Pooled supernatants were sterile-filtered at 0.22 mm and applied 6 3 to PBS-washed protein A beads in a gravity flow column. The column was eluted as described above and the papain procedure repeated overnight with undigested IgGs to increase yield. The protein A flowthroughs were pooled, concentrated (Amicon 10 kDa), and buffer exchanged into PBS. Purity was checked by SDS-PAGE.</p>
        <p>Epitope competition was performed and analyzed using BLI on an Octet Red 96 System (Pall Forte Â´Bio/Sartorius) at 30 C with shaking at 1000 rpm. NTA biosensors (Pall Forte Â´Bio/Sartorius) were hydrated in water for at least 10 min, and were then equilibrated in 10 3 Kinetics buffer (KB) (Pall Forte Â´Bio/Sartorius) for 60 s. 10 ng/mL monomeric RBD in 10 3 KB was loaded for 100 s prior to baseline acquisition in 10 3 KB for 300 s. Tips were then dipped into diluted polyclonal Fab in 10 3 KB in a 1:3 serial dilution beginning with 5000 nM for 2000 s or maintained in 10 3 KB. Tips bound at varying levels depending on the polyclonal Fab concentration. Tips were then dipped into the same concentration of polyclonal Fab plus either 200 nM of hACE2, 400 nM CR3022, or 20 nM S309 and incubated for 300-2000 s. The data were baseline subtracted and aligned to pre-loading with polyclonal Fabs using the Pall Forte Â´Bio/ Sartorius analysis software (version

        <p>Statistical details of experiments can be found in the figure legends and in Data S4. For mouse ELISAs and neutralization experiments, sera from 5 (KyMAb) or 10 (BALB/c) animals (or 2 animals when others were euthanized) were used and experiments were completed in at least duplicate. Geometric mean titers were calculated. Mann-Whitney tests were performed to compare two groups to determine whether they were statistically different for ELISA and neutralization experiments. For flow cytometry, 3 mice per group were analyzed in duplicate and cell counts were determined using Accucheck cell counting beads. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA, and Tukey's multiple comparisons tests were performed for any group with a p value less than 0.05. Significance is indicated with stars: *, p &lt; 0.05; **** p &lt; 0.0001.

The SARS-CoV-2 S-2P ectodomain trimer (GenBank: YP_009724390.1, BEI NR-52420) was synthesized by GenScript into pCMV with an N-terminal mu-phosphatase signal peptide and a C-terminal TEV cleavage site (GSGRENLYPQG), T4 fibritin foldon (GGGSGYIPEAPRDGQAYVRKDGEWVLLSTPL), and octa-histidine tag (GHHHHHHHH)(Walls et al., 2020). The construct contains the 2P mutations (proline substitutions at residues 986 and 987;(Pallesen et al., 2017)) and an 682 SGAG 685 substitution at the furin cleavage site. The SARS-CoV-2 RBD was genetically fused to the N terminus of the trimeric I53-50A nanoparticle component using linkers of 8, 12, or 16 glycine and serine residues. RBD-8GS-and RBD-12GS-I53-50A fusions were synthesized and cloned by Genscript into pCMV.

Animals were singly housed in comfortable, clean, adequately-sized cages with ambient temperatures between 72-82 F. Animals received environmental enrichment for the duration of the study including grooming contact, perches, toys, foraging experiences and access to additional environment enrichment devices. Water was available through automatic watering devices and animals were fed a commercial monkey chow, supplemented daily with fruits and vegetables. Throughout the study, animals were checked twice daily by husbandry staff.</p>
        <p>Samples collected between 1-60 days post infection from 31 individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR were profiled for anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibody responses and the 29 with anti-S Ab responses were maintained in the cohort (Figures 4 and5). Individuals were enrolled as part of the HAARVI study at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA. Baseline sociodemographic and clinical data for these individuals are summarized in Data S5. This study was approved by the University of Washington Human Subjects Division Institutional Review Board (STUDY00000959 and STUDY00003376). All experiments were performed in at least two technical and two biological replicates (for ELISA and pseudovirus neutralization assays). One sample is the 20/130 COVID-19 plasma from NIBSC (https://www.nibsc.org/documents/ifu/20-130.pdf).</p>
        <p>The SARS-CoV-2 RBD (BEI NR-52422) construct was synthesized by GenScript into pcDNA3.1-with an N-terminal mu-phosphatase signal peptide and a C-terminal octa-histidine tag (GHHHHHHHH). The boundaries of the construct are N-328 RFPN 331 and</p>
        <p>Monomeric RBD, RBD-I53-50A fusion proteins, and RBD-I53-50 nanoparticle immunogens were diluted to 2.5 mM in 50 mM Tris pH 7.0, 185 mM NaCl, 100 mM Arginine, 4.5% v/v glycerol, 0.75% w/v CHAPS, and guanidine chloride [GdnHCl] ranging from 0 M to 6.5 M, increasing in 0.25 M increments, and prepared in triplicate. S-2P trimer was also diluted to 2.5 mM using 50 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.25% L-Histidine, and the same GuHCl concentration range. Dilutions were mixed 10 3 by pipetting. The samples were then incubated 18-19 h at ambient temperature. Using a Nano-DSF (UNcle, UNchained Laboratories) and an 8.8 mL quartz capillary cassette (UNi, UNchained Laboratories), fluorescence spectra were collected in triplicate, exciting at 266 nm and measuring emission from 200 nm to 750 nm at 25 C.</p>
        <p>Endotoxin levels in protein samples were measured using the EndoSafe Nexgen-MCS System (Charles River). Samples were diluted 1:50 or 1:100 in Endotoxin-free LAL reagent water, and applied into wells of an EndoSafe LAL reagent cartridge. Charles River 
            <rs type="software">EndoScan-V</rs> software was used to analyze endotoxin content, automatically back-calculating for the dilution factor. Endotoxin values were reported as EU/mL which were then converted to EU/mg based on UV/vis measurements. Our threshold for samples suitable for immunization was &lt; 50 EU/mg.
        </p>
        <p>Ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry (UV/vis) was measured using an Agilent Technologies Cary 8454. Samples were applied to a 10 mm, 50 mL quartz cell (Starna Cells, Inc.) and absorbance was measured from 180 to 1000 nm. Net absorbance at 280 nm, obtained from measurement and single reference wavelength baseline subtraction, was used with calculated extinction coefficients and molecular weights to obtain protein concentration. The ratio of absorbance at 320/280 nm was used to determine relative aggregation levels in real-time stability study samples. Samples were diluted with respective purification/instrument blanking buffers to obtain an absorbance between 0.1 and 1.0. All data produced from the UV/vis instrument was processed in the

        <p>To identify site-specific glycosylation profiles, including glycoform distribution and occupancy determination, a bottom up mass spectrometry (MS) approach was utilized. Aliquots of 1 mg/mL monomeric, 8GS, 12GS and 16GS RBD protein were prepared to evaluate the glycosylation profiles at N331 and N343 of the four RBD variants. Comprehensive glycoprofiling on the stabilized Spike ectodomain (S-2P) was performed in parallel using 1.5 mg/mL SARS-CoV-2 S-2P protein. All the samples were denatured in a solution containing 25 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 7 M guanidinium chloride (GdnHCl) and 50 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at 90 C for 30 min. Reduced cysteines were alkylated by adding fresh iodoacetamide (IAA) to 100 mM and incubating at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. 50 mM excess DTT was then added to quench the remaining IAA. The GndHCl concentration was reduced to 0.6 M by diluting the samples 11-fold with a 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 2 mM calcium chloride solution. Each sample was then split in half. One half (275 mL) was mixed with 10 units of recombinant Peptide N-glycanase F (GST-PNGase F) (Krenkova et al., 2013) and incubated at 37 C for 1 h in order to convert glycosylated Asn into deglycosylated Asp. Protease digestions were performed in the following manner: all RBD samples and one S-2P sample were digested with Lys-C at a ratio of 1:40 (w/w) for RBD and 1:30 (w/w) for S-2P for 4 h at 37 C, followed by Glu-C digestion overnight at the same ratios and conditions. The other three S-2P samples were digested with trypsin, chymotrypsin and alpha lytic protease, respectively, at a ratio of 1:30 (w/w) overnight at 37 C. All the digestion proteases used were MS grade (Promega). The next day, the digestion reactions were quenched by 0.02% formic acid (FA, Optima TM , Fisher).</p>
        <p>The glycoform determination of four S-2P samples was performed by nano LC-MS using an Orbitrap Fusion TM mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). The digested samples were desalted by Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters) following the manufacturer's suggested protocol. A 2 cm trapping column and a 35 cm analytical column were freshly prepared in fused silica (100 mm ID) with 5 mM ReproSil-Pur C18 AQ beads (Dr. Maisch). 8 mL sample was injected and run by a 60-min linear gradient from 2% to 30% acetonitrile in 0.1% FA, followed by 10 min of 80% acetonitrile. An EThcD method was optimized as followed: ion source: 2.1 kV for positive mode; ion transfer tube temperature: 350 Ã¾C; resolution: MS 1 = 120000, MS 2 = 30000; AGC target: MS 1 = 2e 5 , MS 2 = 1e 5 ; and injection time: MS 1 = 50 ms, MS 2 = 60 ms.</p>
        <p>Glycopeptide data were visualized and processed by Byonic TM and Byologic TM (Version 3.8, Protein Metrics Inc.) using a 6 ppm precursor and 10 ppm fragment mass tolerance. Glycopeptides were searched using the N-glycan 309 mammalian database in Protein Metrics PMI-Suite and scored based on the assignment of correct c-and z-fragment ions. The true-positive entities were further validated by the presence of glycan oxonium ions m/z at 204 (HexNAc ions) and 366 (HexNAcHex ions) and the absence in its corresponding spectrum in the deglycosylated sample. The relative abundance of each glycoform was determined by the peak area analyzed in Byologic TM . Glycoforms were categorized as either Oligomannose: HexNAc(2)Hex(9-5); Hybrid: HexNAc(3)Hex(5-6); or various subtypes of Complex: HexNAc(3)Hex(3-4)X as A1 subtype; HexNAc(4)X as A2/A1B; HexNAc(5)X as A3/A2B; and</p>
