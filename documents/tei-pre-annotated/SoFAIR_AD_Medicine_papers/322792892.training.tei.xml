        <p>Background: Targeting the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis has demonstrated clinical benefit in recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC). Combining immunotherapies targeting PD-L1 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) has shown evidence of additive activity in several tumor types. This phase III study evaluated the efficacy of durvalumab (an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody) or durvalumab plus tremelimumab (an anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody) versus standard of care (SoC) in R/M HNSCC patients. Patients and methods: Patients were randomly assigned to receive 1 : 1 : 1 durvalumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks [q2w]), durvalumab plus tremelimumab (durvalumab 20 mg/kg q4w plus tremelimumab 1 mg/kg q4w Â 4, then durvalumab 10 mg/kg q2w), or SoC (cetuximab, a taxane, methotrexate, or a fluoropyrimidine). The primary end points were overall survival (OS) for durvalumab versus SoC, and OS for durvalumab plus tremelimumab versus SoC. Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate, and duration of response. Results: Patients were randomly assigned to receive durvalumab (n ¼ 240), durvalumab plus tremelimumab (n ¼ 247), or SoC (n ¼ 249). No statistically significant improvements in OS were observed for durvalumab versus SoC [hazard ratio (HR): 0.88; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.72e1.08; P ¼ 0.20] or durvalumab plus tremelimumab versus SoC (HR: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.85e1.26; P ¼ 0.76). The 12-month survival rates (95% CI) were 37.0% (30.9e43.1), 30.4% (24.7e36.3), and 30.5% (24.7 e36.4) for durvalumab, durvalumab plus tremelimumab, and SoC, respectively. Treatment-related adverse events (trAEs) were consistent with previous reports. The most common trAEs (any grade) were hypothyroidism for durvalumab and durvalumab plus tremelimumab (11.4% and 12.2%, respectively), and anemia (17.5%) for SoC. Grade !3 trAE rates were 10.1%, 16.3%, and 24.2% for durvalumab, durvalumab plus tremelimumab, and SoC, respectively. Conclusion: There were no statistically significant differences in OS for durvalumab or durvalumab plus tremelimumab versus SoC. However, higher survival rates at 12 to 24 months and response rates demonstrate clinical activity for durvalumab.

        <p>Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is among the 10 most common cancers worldwide, with increasing incidence. 1 Approximately 10% of patients with HNSCC will be diagnosed with metastatic disease, and even when treated early, around half will have disease recurrence. 2,3 The platinum-based doublet chemotherapy with cetuximab regimen has been the most widely-used therapy and considered standard of care (SoC) since it was proven effective in 2007 for recurrent/metastatic (R/M) HNSCC in the first-line setting. 3,4 However, patients typically progress even after aggressive first-line therapy, and, until recently, the available options (e.g. cetuximab, methotrexate, and taxanes) have delivered limited survival benefits. 3 Durvalumab is an immunotherapeutic agent that blocks the interaction between programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and its receptors. 5 Durvalumab demonstrated encouraging response rates and duration of response (DoR) with a manageable safety profile in patients with HNSCC. 6 Although monotherapy agents that block the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 axis have shown clinical activity, immunotherapy combinations have the potential to improve upon monotherapy activity. 7e9 Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and PD-L1/PD-1 pathways have largely non-redundant roles, suggesting that blockade of both could have additive or synergistic effects. 10 Indeed, the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody, was explored based on improved efficacy over monotherapy in other solid tumor types. 7 This observation, in addition to the activity demonstrated by durvalumab in earlier R/M HNSCC studies, served as the rationale to evaluate durvalumab and tremelimumab in patients with R/M HNSCC. Several studies, including the EAGLE study, were initiated to evaluate combination immunotherapy regimens in various patient groups. 11,12 The EAGLE study was the first phase III study to investigate durvalumab and tremelimumab in patients with R/M HNSCC who had progressed after platinumbased therapy.Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is among the 10 most common cancers worldwide, with increasing incidence. 1 Approximately 10% of patients with HNSCC will be diagnosed with metastatic disease, and even when treated early, around half will have disease recurrence. 2,3 The platinum-based doublet chemotherapy with cetuximab regimen has been the most widely-used therapy and considered standard of care (SoC) since it was proven effective in 2007 for recurrent/metastatic (R/M) HNSCC in the first-line setting. 3,4 However, patients typically progress even after aggressive first-line therapy, and, until recently, the available options (e.g. cetuximab, methotrexate, and taxanes) have delivered limited survival benefits. 3 Durvalumab is an immunotherapeutic agent that blocks the interaction between programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and its receptors. 5 Durvalumab demonstrated encouraging response rates and duration of response (DoR) with a manageable safety profile in patients with HNSCC. 6 Although monotherapy agents that block the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 axis have shown clinical activity, immunotherapy combinations have the potential to improve upon monotherapy activity. 7e9 Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and PD-L1/PD-1 pathways have largely non-redundant roles, suggesting that blockade of both could have additive or synergistic effects. 10 Indeed, the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody, was explored based on improved efficacy over monotherapy in other solid tumor types. 7 This observation, in addition to the activity demonstrated by durvalumab in earlier R/M HNSCC studies, served as the rationale to evaluate durvalumab and tremelimumab in patients with R/M HNSCC.

        <p>During the conduct of the EAGLE study, anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies were approved for use for R/M HNSCC progression following a platinum-based regimen. Treatment with these immunotherapies resulted in a median overall survival (OS) of 7.5e8.4 months. 13,14 These immunotherapies are now recommended for second-line treatment as monotherapies for patients with R/M HNSCC. 3,13,14 More recently, immunotherapy alone or in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy has shown improvements in OS in the first-line setting, underscoring the clinical utility of immunotherapy in HNSCC. 15 Here, we report the results of the randomized phase III EAGLE trial evaluating durvalumab and durvalumab plus tremelimumab versus SoC therapies in patients with R/M HNSCC who have progressed following a platinumcontaining regimen.During the conduct of the EAGLE study, anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies were approved for use for R/M HNSCC progression following a platinum-based regimen.

        <p>The study was conducted at 156 sites globally in accordance with ethical principles originating from the Declaration of Helsinki and consistent with International Conference on Harmonisation and Good Clinical Practice guidelines, applicable regulatory requirements, and sponsor's policy on Bioethics and Human Biological Samples. Written informed consent from participants was obtained before performing any protocol-related procedures. Randomization was stratified according to PD-L1 expression, tumor location/human papilloma virus (HPV) status, and smoking status. PD-L1 expression was centrally assessed using the VENTANA (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., Tuscon, AZ) PD-L1 (SP263) Assay, using a cut-off of !25% tumor cells (TC ! 25%) with membrane staining for PD-L1 at any intensity. 16 HPV was assessed according to local standard procedures, including immunohistochemistry, FISH or polymerase chain reaction.The study was conducted at 156 sites globally in accordance with ethical principles originating from the Declaration of Helsinki and consistent with International Conference on Harmonisation and Good Clinical Practice guidelines, applicable regulatory requirements, and sponsor's policy on Bioethics and Human Biological Samples.

The median age for all patients was 60.0 years, 84.0% were male, 82.1% were white, and 15.7% were Asian. At baseline, 28.8% of tumor samples had PD-L1 expression of TC ! 25%.

There were numerically higher survival rates for durvalumab plus tremelimumab at 18 and 24 months (Figure 2B).

        <p>As the ORR was higher than expected, and notably, because the median OS for SoC was unexpectedly long considering historical values and more recent reports, post hoc analyses were conducted to understand the performance of the SoC arm. As noted, there were imbalances in ECOG PS and patients with only distant metastatic disease at baseline. A multivariate analysis confirmed that these were prognostic, and when the primary stratified Cox model was adjusted for these characteristics, the HR was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.66e1.00) for durvalumab compared with SoC (Supplementary Table S1, available at Annals of Oncology online). Another post hoc analysis evaluated the impact of subsequent therapy on OS in the SoC arm, and showed that 263 (35.7%) patients from all arms received subsequent therapy after discontinuation.

        <p>The median duration of exposure was approximately 3 months for each arm (Supplementary Table S2, available at Annals of Oncology online). Treatment-related AEs (trAEs) of any grade occurred in 57.4% in the durvalumab arm, 61.0% in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab arm, and 82.1% in the SoC arm (Table 2). Grade !3 trAEs occurred in 24 patients (10.1%) receiving durvalumab, 40 patients (16.3%) receiving durvalumab plus tremelimumab, and 58 patients (24.2%) receiving SoC. Discontinuation attributed to trAEs occurred in nine patients (3.8%) in the durvalumab arm, 10 (4.1%) in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab arm, and 10 (4.2%) in the SoC arm (Supplementary Table S3, available at Annals of Oncology online). Any bleeding-related trAEs were rare (Supplementary information, available at Annals of Oncology online). Death attributed to trAEs occurred in four patients in the durvalumab arm, two in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab arm, and none in the SoC arm.The median duration of exposure was approximately 3 months for each arm (Supplementary Table S2, available at Annals of Oncology online). Treatment-related AEs (trAEs) of any grade occurred in 57.4% in the durvalumab arm, 61.0% in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab arm, and 82.1% in the SoC arm (Table 2). Grade !3 trAEs occurred in 24 patients (10.1%) receiving durvalumab, 40 patients (16.3%) receiving durvalumab plus tremelimumab, and 58 patients (24.2%) receiving SoC.

        <p>The study results did not demonstrate a statistically significant survival benefit for immunotherapy over single-agent SoC as second-line treatment of patients with R/M HNSCC. Combining durvalumab with tremelimumab did not show improvement over durvalumab activity, though it should be noted that the EAGLE study was not designed for comparison between durvalumab and durvalumab plus tremelimumab arms.The study results did not demonstrate a statistically significant survival benefit for immunotherapy over single-agent SoC as second-line treatment of patients with R/M HNSCC.

        <p>Despite the apparent lack of benefit over SoC, durvalumab clinical activity was in line with other checkpoint blockade agents in this setting. 13,14 Although cross-trial comparisons should be approached with caution, median OS for durvalumab (7.6 months) was similar to median OS for nivolumab (7.5 months) and pembrolizumab (8.4 months) in comparable patient populations. Likewise, 12month survival rates for all three were similar (durvalumab, 37.0%; nivolumab, 36.0%; pembrolizumab, 37.0%). 13,14 Additionally, within the context of the EAGLE study, there were examples of activity in favor of durvalumab, including complete responders and longer DoR versus SoC, suggesting that the benefit from durvalumab was more durable than from SoC. There also seems to be a survival benefit favoring durvalumab, with 12-, 18-, and 24-month survival rates being numerically higher in the durvalumab arm versus the SoC arm.Despite the apparent lack of benefit over SoC, durvalumab clinical activity was in line with other checkpoint blockade agents in this setting. 13,14 Although cross-trial comparisons should be approached with caution, median OS for durvalumab (7.6 months) was similar to median OS for nivolumab (7.5 months) and pembrolizumab (8.4 months) in comparable patient populations.

        <p>This study was characterized by an unexpectedly high OS for the SoC arm with a median of 8.3 months. This outcome was higher than median OS values for SoC arms reported in similar studies with PD-1 inhibitors (5.1e6.9 months). 13,14 Several potential contributing factors were identified. One factor, and a key difference between EAGLE and other studies, is that both paclitaxel and docetaxel were used as choices for SoC in this study, while only docetaxel was allowed in other studies. A comparison of paclitaxel and docetaxel activity within the SoC arm of the EAGLE study showed a nominal HR of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.44e1.13) in favor of paclitaxel. Notably, more patients were treated with paclitaxel than docetaxel. Another factor that commonly affects assessment of OS is subsequent therapy. A post hoc analysis showed that patients who received an immunotherapy agent after discontinuation of treatment in the EAGLE study had longer OS. A higher percentage of patients from the SoC arm went on to receive subsequent immunotherapy. Lastly, imbalances were noted in clinical characteristics between the randomized groups, specifically ECOG PS and patients with metastatic disease only (as opposed to loco-regional disease with or without metastatic disease) at baseline. Other imbalances were evaluated, but none impacted OS and, indeed, both characteristics have been reported to have a meaningful prognostic impact on OS in other studies involving patients with R/M HNSCC. 17,18 These factors may have confounded the results by creating a larger proportion of patients with a more favorable prognosis in the SoC arm and a multivariate analysis adjusting for these imbalanced factors showed that the estimated treatment effect improved in favor of immunotherapy when accounting for that imbalance. Collectively, choice of SoC therapy, subsequent therapy, and imbalances in clinical characteristics provide a possible explanation for the longer-than-expected OS of the SoC arm.This study was characterized by an unexpectedly high OS for the SoC arm with a median of 8.3 months.

        <p>It is worth noting that a recently published systematic analysis by the US Food and Drug Administration identified a trend in disproportionately high early mortality rates in studies evaluating anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 agents against active control arms where authors describe a crossing of KaplaneMeier OS curves. 19 This phenomenon was also observed in the EAGLE study where a higher percentage of patients in the immunotherapy arms died within the first 3 months from randomization. Conversely, higher survival rates for durvalumab indicates that patients who live beyond the initial treatment period may be those most likely to receive benefit. It is therefore critical to develop a means to identify patients at risk of early death, which could guide treatment decisions by identifying patients who are optimal candidates for single-agent immunotherapy.It is worth noting that a recently published systematic analysis by the US Food and Drug Administration identified a trend in disproportionately high early mortality rates in studies evaluating anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 agents against active control arms where authors describe a crossing of KaplaneMeier OS curves. 19 This phenomenon was also observed in the EAGLE study where a higher percentage of patients in the immunotherapy arms died within the first 3 months from randomization.

        <p>The safety profile for durvalumab was consistent with prior data. 11,12 The durvalumab plus tremelimumab arm was likewise consistent with other studies evaluating this regimen, though grade 3e4 trAEs and the discontinuation rate were slightly higher than with durvalumab alone. 7,11 Following a voluntary recruitment pause initiated to investigate bleeding AEs, no association between durvalumab or durvalumab plus tremelimumab and bleeding-related AEs was found and recruitment was resumed.The safety profile for durvalumab was consistent with prior data. 11,12 The durvalumab plus tremelimumab arm was likewise consistent with other studies evaluating this regimen, though grade 3e4 trAEs and the discontinuation rate were slightly higher than with durvalumab alone. 7,11 Following a voluntary recruitment pause initiated to investigate bleeding AEs, no association between durvalumab or durvalumab plus tremelimumab and bleeding-related AEs was found and recruitment was resumed.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, although durvalumab showed antitumor activity and durvalumab and durvalumab plus tremelimumab did prove to be tolerable, the primary objectives of the study were not met. Further biomarker evaluations are underway in an attempt to understand the clinical activity of immune checkpoint inhibition in this setting.In conclusion, although durvalumab showed antitumor activity and durvalumab and durvalumab plus tremelimumab did prove to be tolerable, the primary objectives of the study were not met.
