        <p>Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a multisystem human genomic imprinting disorder with variable clinical expression and complex molecular aetiology 1 . BWS is an overgrowth syndrome, with patients often presenting with macroglossia, abdominal wall defects, hemihy perplasia (lateralized overgrowth), enlarged abdominal organs and an increased risk of embryonal tumours during early childhood. BWS is caused mainly by genetic or epigenetic defects within the chromosome 11p15.5 region 2 . This region contains imprinted genes, such as CDKN1C and IGF2, which are strong regulators of fetal growth. Although BWS might present prenatally or in adult life, it is most commonly diagnosed in the neonatal period or in early childhood, with an estimated prevalence of 1 affected childBeckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a multisystem human genomic imprinting disorder with variable clinical expression and complex molecular aetiology 1 .

        <p>The international BWS consensus group comprised 41 participants from 36 institutions across 11 countries, predominantly based in Europe, including clinicians, clinical and research scientists and patient group representatives with expertise in different aspects of BWS (clinical and molecular geneticists, paediatric endocrinologists, oncologists, orthopaedists, oro-facial surgeons and nephrologists). A modified Delphi consensus process was adopted 4 . Discussions occurred via conference calls, email communications and file exchanges. Two face-to-face meetings were held: a preliminary meeting of 11 participants (including one patient group representative) in February 2016 to identify the key issues to be addressed by the consensus group and a plenary 3-day meeting involving 35 participants (including 2 patient group representatives) in March 2017. During this plenary meeting, experts participated in one of the three subgroups (clinical, molecular or management) on the basis of their field of expertise, discussed the draft consensus documents and formulated and voted on the consensus recommendations (BOX 1). This Consensus Statement summarizes the outcome of these discussions and is divided into three subject areas: clinical aspects; molecular aspects; and care and management.The international BWS consensus group comprised 41 participants from 36 institutions across 11 countries, predominantly based in Europe, including clinicians, clinical and research scientists and patient group representatives with expertise in different aspects of BWS (clinical and molecular geneticists, paediatric endocrinologists, oncologists, orthopaedists, oro-facial surgeons and nephrologists).

        <p>Since the seminal descriptions by Beckwith 5 and Wiedemann 6 in the 1960s, there have been many attempts to define BWS by use of various clinical criteria that have been reported with different prevalences in cohorts of BWS (Supplementary information S1 (table)); however, no agreed clinical definition of BWS has emerged. Since the findings in the 1990s of molecular abnormalities of chromosome 11p15.5 in BWS [7][8][9] , it has been recognized that these genetic and epigenetic changes are frequently mosaic and lead to a range of clinical phenotypes. These include 'classical BWS' (OMIM #130650), which is characterized by macroglossia, anterior abdominal wall defects and prenatal and postnatal overgrowth, among other symptoms (Supplementary information S1 (table)), and some cases of isolated lateralized overgrowth (previously called 'isolated hemihypertrophy' or 'isolated hemihyperplasia'; OMIM #235000) 10 in addition to patients with a chromosome 11p15.5 molecular anomaly who do not fit into these first two groups, a condition termed 'atypical BWS' by this consensus group. Given the overlapping phenotypes and common molecular mechanisms between these groups, the consensus group decided that these phenotype and/or genotype combinations could be best classified as parts of the BWSp (TABLE 1, R1)and that the recommendations of this consensus should be applied to individuals with BWSp (FIG. 1; TABLE 1).Since the seminal descriptions by Beckwith 5 and Wiedemann 6 in the 1960s, there have been many attempts to define BWS by use of various clinical criteria that have been reported with different prevalences in cohorts of BWS (Supplementary information S1 (table)); however, no agreed clinical definition of BWS has emerged.

        <p>BWS has classically been characterized by macroglossia, macrosomia, abdominal wall defects and an increased risk of embryonal tumours [11][12][13][14][15][16][17] . There is growing recognition that not all patients with BWS display all of these phenotypic features and that patients have remained undiagnosed because they did not present with one of these features, such as macrosomia, which was initially considered as a cardinal feature but is present in only onehalf of the patients with an 11p15.5 molecular defect 18,19 . The clinical features outlined as part of the consensus BWSp scoring system include features that, when present, are more likely to lead to a positive diagnosis (termed 'cardinal features'), including macroglossia, exomphalos, lateralized overgrowth, multifocal Wilms tumour or nephroblastomatosis, hyperinsulinism and specific pathology findings (such as adrenal cytomegaly or placental mesenchymal dysplasia) (BOX 2). Macrosomia has been defined according to different criteria in different clinical cohorts [11][12][13][15][16][17] , making it challenging to assess the role it has as a cardinal feature. Lateralized overgrowth is the novel term for hemihypertrophy (or hemihyperplasia), which is defined as asymmetric overgrowth of part of the body 10 . Embryonal tumours such as Wilms tumours and hepatoblastoma can occur outside of the diagnostic scope of BWSp; however, multifocal Wilms tumours are more likely to occur in BWSp. As a cardinal feature, hyperinsulinism is defined as prolonged hypoglycaemia in the context of elevated insulin levels that last &gt;1 week and/or require escalated treatment 20 , while transient hypoglycaemia resolves without the need for further intervention. Although pathology findings cannot always be evaluated (especially when BWSp is not suspected prenatally or at birth and when placental samples are not collected), the diagnosis of BWSp should be considered in cases of adrenal cortex cytomegaly, placental mesenchymal dysplasia and pancreatic adenomatosis 5 . Additionally, if samples are available (especially from the placenta after birth) and the diagnosis is being considered, pathological investigation can be beneficial in making the clinical diagnosis.BWS has classically been characterized by macroglossia, macrosomia, abdominal wall defects and an increased risk of embryonal tumours [11][12][13][14][15][16][17] .

        <p>The many previously proposed systems to define BWS have suggested various combinations of clinical features (with macroglossia, exomphalos and/or (asymmetric) overgrowth as major features) [11][12][13]18,21,22 with the aim of optimizing the likelihood of a classical and molecularly confirmed diagnosis. Frequently cited and recent phenotype articles from the past 25 years were reviewed for the prevalence of individual clinical features (Supplementary information S1 (table)), which were then classified as cardinal or suggestive features (BOX 2). As several of these articles referenced the same patient cohorts [12][13][14][15][16]18,[21][22][23][24][25][26] , data were analysed from the nine articles describing apparently distinct cohorts 11,12,14,15,18,21,23,25,26 . The goal of this BWSp scoring system (TABLE 1; BOX 2) was to recognize that BWS falls into a clinical spectrum and that some features that have long been considered to be classical parts of the syndrome are not present in every patient, and therefore, the diagnosis should not be dismissed owing to the absence of such features. Additionally, this Consensus Statement sought to include elements that could be pathognomonic for BWS. In addition to informing the presence of a diagnosis of classical BWS, the consensus group also determined that the same system could be used to provide guidance regarding when to pursue genetic testing. We compared this new scoring system with previously published systems (Supplementary information S2 (figure)) while keeping in mind that previous systems focused on the diagnosis of classical BWS and molecularly confirmed BWS and not the diagnosis of the BWSp.The many previously proposed systems to define BWS have suggested various combinations of clinical features (with macroglossia, exomphalos and/or (asymmetric) overgrowth as major features) [11][12][13]18,21,22 with the aim of optimizing the likelihood of a classical and molecularly confirmed diagnosis.

        <p>. Cardinal and suggestive feature designations were analysed in the BWSp cohort reported by Ibrahim et al. 11 and were shown to be largely superior to previous diagnostic systems (Supplementary information S2 (figure )). Limitations of the study were that transient hypoglycaemia versus prolonged hyperinsulinism were not typically distinguished in the prior cohorts, so this feature could therefore not be assessed, and that macrosomia was variably defined in previous cohorts [11][12][13][14]17,18,21,22 . For simplicity, we recommend molecular testing for any patient with ≥2 points. In cases where isolated omphalocele and/or exomphalos is present, testing can be considered at the discretion of the physician. Testing is also recommended with a family history of a parent with heritable pathogenic 11p15 anomaly, which places the child at a 50% risk of being affected.

        <p>For simplicity and consistency, we have developed consensus criteria by use of cardinal and suggestive features (TABLE 1, R2). For a clinical diagnosis of classical BWS, a patient requires a score of ≥4 based on cardinal and suggestive features; this clinical diagnosis does not require the molecular confirmation of an 11p15.5 anomaly. Patients with a score of ≥2 (including those with classical BWS with a score of ≥4) merit genetic testing according to our algorithm for investigation and diagnosis of BWS (FIG. 2). Patients with a score of &lt;2 do not meet the criteria for genetic testing. Patients with a score of ≥2 with negative genetic testing should be considered for an alternative diagnosis and/or referral to a BWS expert for further evaluation.For simplicity and consistency, we have developed consensus criteria by use of cardinal and suggestive features (TABLE 1, R2).

        <p>Clinical diagnosis within the BWSp beyond the clear diagnosis of classical BWS or a clear molecular diagnosis is challenging and requires a combination of molecular testing and physician opinion. There is currently not enough published data to provide clear clinical recommendations for patients with a score of &lt;4 who have no molecular abnormality. Nonetheless, patients with a cardinal feature of BWS (such as macroglossia, hyperinsulinism, a multifocal Wilms tumour or a pathological finding) should be referred to a specialist with expertise in BWS for further evaluation. Patients with isolated exomphalos are more common and are less likely to have an 11p15.5 defect compared with patients with other isolated symptoms, and should therefore not be included in the BWSp. Lateralized overgrowth can occur both as a symptom of BWSp and independent of BWSp 10 . When lateralized overgrowth occurs with an 11p15 abnormality, it is considered part of BWSp. As there are multiple molecular causes of lateralized overgrowth aside from 11p anomalies (for example, PIK3CA and AKT1 mutations), lateralized overgrowth without an 11p15 anomaly in a child who does not meet the criteria for classical BWS was considered to be outside the BWSp and the scope of this Consensus Statement; thus, recommendations for further investigation and clinical management were not made (TABLE 1, R3).Clinical diagnosis within the BWSp beyond the clear diagnosis of classical BWS or a clear molecular diagnosis is challenging and requires a combination of molecular testing and physician opinion.

        <p>Assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) are defined as treatments handling male and female gametes outside of the body and include procedures such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) 31 . ARTs account for 1-3% of all births in industrialized countries 31 . Although these techniques are regarded as safe, it has been suggested that the establishment and/or maintenance of DNA methylation at imprinted loci might be disturbed by ART [31][32][33][34][35][36] . Following reports of children with a rare molecular subtype of Angelman syndrome who were conceived by ICSI 32,33 and an increased frequency (~4-6-fold) of ART births in children with BWS [34][35][36] , a population-based study estimated the risk of BWS in IVF-conceived children to be approximately 1 in 4,000, substantially greater than that in the general population 31 . A study from 2017 reported a tenfold increased risk of BWS with ART but an absolute risk of approximately 1 in 1,000 (REF. 37). Although some epidemiological studies have not detected an increased relative risk of BWS in children born after ART 38,39 , molecular studies support an association, as &gt;90% of children with BWS conceived by genetic change at the BWS locus on chromosome 11p15, patients with 'atypical BWS' (defined as fewer cardinal and suggestive features than those needed for a clinical diagnosis of BWS) and an (epi)genetic change at the BWS locus, and patients with 'isolated lateralized overgrowth' and an (epi)genetic change at the BWS locus. The dotted arrow indicates that some patients with apparent isolated lateralized overgrowth and no 11p15 abnormality might subsequently be found to have an 11p15 abnormality on testing of additional tissues or with a more sensitive assay. Patients with clinical BWS and no detectable 11p15 abnormality might be further investigated with additional clinical evaluation and consideration of other syndromes, which may have features overlapping with BWSp, and appropriate testing for those syndromes may be warranted. ARTs have an epimutation at the centromeric imprinting centre KCNQ1OT1:transcriptional start site (TSS) differentially methylated region (DMR) (also known as IC2), compared with ~50% of children with BWS who were not conceived by ART 40 . Various factors might contribute to an association between ARTs and Angelman syndrome or BWS, including infertility per se (that is, independently to ART techniques) 41,42 , superovulation or in vitro embryo culture [43][44][45] . The link between ART and epigenetic defects has also been suggested by the large offspring syndrome (an ART-associated phenomenon in sheep and cows that has some phenotypic similarity to BWS), which has been reported to be associated with epigenetic alterations similar to those observed in BWS 46 . However, although there is clear evidence linking ARTs and BWS, additional research is required to further elucidate the relationships between subfertility, hormonal stimulation, embryo manipulation and imprinting defects (TABLE 1, R6).Assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) are defined as treatments handling male and female gametes outside of the body and include procedures such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) 31 .

Following reports of children with a rare molecular subtype of Angelman syndrome who were conceived by ICSI 32,33 and an increased frequency (~4-6-fold) of ART births in children with BWS [34][35][36] , a population-based study estimated the risk of BWS in IVF-conceived children to be approximately 1 in 4,000, substantially greater than that in the general population 31 . A study from 2017 reported a tenfold increased risk of BWS with ART but an absolute risk of approximately 1 in 1,000 (REF. 37). Although some epidemiological studies have not detected an increased relative risk of BWS in children born after ART 38,39 , molecular studies support an association, as &gt;90% of children with BWS conceived by genetic change at the BWS locus on chromosome 11p15, patients with 'atypical BWS' (defined as fewer cardinal and suggestive features than those needed for a clinical diagnosis of BWS) and an (epi)genetic change at the BWS locus, and patients with 'isolated lateralized overgrowth' and an (epi)genetic change at the BWS locus. The dotted arrow indicates that some patients with apparent isolated lateralized overgrowth and no 11p15 abnormality might subsequently be found to have an 11p15 abnormality on testing of additional tissues or with a more sensitive assay. Patients with clinical BWS and no detectable 11p15 abnormality might be further investigated with additional clinical evaluation and consideration of other syndromes, which may have features overlapping with BWSp, and appropriate testing for those syndromes may be warranted. ARTs have an epimutation at the centromeric imprinting centre KCNQ1OT1:transcriptional start site (TSS) differentially methylated region (DMR) (also known as IC2), compared with ~50% of children with BWS who were not conceived by ART 40 . Various factors might contribute to an association between ARTs and Angelman syndrome or BWS, including infertility per se (that is, independently to ART techniques) 41,42 , superovulation or in vitro embryo culture [43][44][45] . The link between ART and epigenetic defects has also been suggested by the large offspring syndrome (an ART-associated phenomenon in sheep and cows that has some phenotypic similarity to BWS), which has been reported to be associated with epigenetic alterations similar to those observed in BWS 46 . However, although there is clear evidence linking ARTs and BWS, additional research is required to further elucidate the relationships between subfertility, hormonal stimulation, embryo manipulation and imprinting defects (TABLE 1, R6).</p>
        <p>BWSp is associated with molecular abnormalities affecting a cluster of imprinted genes located within the chromosome region 11p15.5-11p15.4, which is divided into two functionally independent domains: the centromeric and telomeric domains 2 (FIG. 3). Each domain harbours its own imprinting control region, marked by a DMR. The insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2)-encoding gene (IGF2) and the gene encoding the non-translated long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) H19 are located in the telomeric domain and are controlled by the H19/IGF2: intergenic (IG) DMR (also known as imprinting control region 1 (ICR1), H19-DMR or Imprinting Centre 1 (IC1); OMIM *616186). The cell cycle inhibitor gene CDKN1C and the gene encoding the regulatory lncRNA KCNQ1OT1 are located in the centromeric domain and are controlled by the KCNQ1OT1:TSS DMR (also known as KvDMR, LIT1-DMR, imprinting control region 2 (ICR2) or Imprinting Centre 2 (IC2); OMIM *604115).

        <p>A molecular defect affecting imprinted genes in chromosome region 11p15 can be demonstrated in ~80% of patients with BWSp 2 . DNA methylation abnormalities are the most frequent defects; loss of methylation (LOM) at the maternal IC2 allele is found in ~50% of patients and gain of methylation (GOM) at the maternal IC1 allele in 5-10% of patients 48 . Mosaic, segmental paternal uniparental isodisomy (UPD) of 11p15.5 (commonly referred to as segmental upd(11)pat) can be detected in 20% of patients, intragenic CDKN1C mutations can be detected in 5% of sporadic and 40% of familial cases, and chromosomal abnormalities in 11p15 can be detected in &lt;5% of patients; a molecular diagnosis is not reached in up to 20% of patients 2 . The frequency of twinning is markedly higher in patients with BWS than the general population; in the majority of cases, twins are female, monozygous and discordant (that is, one twin is affected and one is unaffected by BWSp) 49 . Owing to the sharing of circulation during development, DNA from blood cells or saliva might show aberrant DNA methylation (usually IC2 LOM) in both affected and unaffected discordant twins, whereas methylation is concordant with phenotype in non-blood-derived samples such as buccal swab 50 .

        <p>First-line molecular testing procedures should assay IC1 and IC2 methylation (TABLE 2, R9). Methylation is abnormal in cases of IC2 LOM, IC1 GOM, copy number variations (CNVs) and segmental upd (11)pat (both IC2 LOM and IC1 GOM) 51 . Abnormal methylation status confirms a diagnosis of BWSp, but its underlying mechanism must be established to define management, genetic counselling and recurrence risks 48,51 . Thus, if methylation is assayed using a technique that does not estimate DMR copy number, this should then be determined in all patients with IC1 and/or IC2 methylation abnormalities (FIG. 2).

        <p>In patients with BWSp for whom a risk of recurrence has been identified (TABLE 3), some parents might wish to consider prenatal diagnosis. If a molecular diagnosis is not available or indicated, then ultrasonographic detection of an anterior abdominal wall defect or macroglossia or, less specifically, macrosomia, visceromegaly, polyhydramnios, placentomegaly or pancreatic overgrowth might indicate a likely diagnosis of BWSp 109 . Rarer manifestations detectable by prenatal ultrasound scan (USS) include placental mesenchymal dysplasia, urinary tract abnormalities, cardiac defects, adrenal cysts and masses 110,111 . Abnormal prenatal biochemical screening results -for example, elevated levels of free β-human chorionic gonadotropin in the first trimester [109][110][111] and/or increased α-fetoprotein (AFP) levels in the second trimester (associated with exomphalos) 112 -can be associated with BWSp in the fetus. In pregnancies known to be at increased risk of BWSp, the presence of a single anomaly (for example, exomphalos) might be sufficient to make a presumptive diagnosis.In patients with BWSp for whom a risk of recurrence has been identified (TABLE 3), some parents might wish to consider prenatal diagnosis.

        <p>In pregnancies without a previous history of BWSp, none of the prenatally detectable features of BWSp are, in isolation, pathognomonic. Approximately 10-20% of fetuses with a prenatally diagnosed isolated exomphalos 112,113 and ~20% of those with placental mesenchymal dysplasia 114 will have BWSp. As cytogenetic and/or chromosome microarray analysis are indicated for both these findings, molecular analysis for BWSp can also be performed on the same sample, and confirmation or exclusion of BWSp might be helpful for the parents. For less-specific features (for example, urinary tract abnormalities and cardiac defects), testing for BWSp is likely to depend on whether there are multiple BWSp-related features present.In pregnancies without a previous history of BWSp, none of the prenatally detectable features of BWSp are, in isolation, pathognomonic.

        <p>When a prenatal diagnosis of BWSp is suspected or confirmed, the management of individual congenital anomalies (for example, exomphalos or cardiac defect) generally follows standard protocols based on usual local practices. However, macrosomia might cause problems (for example, shoulder dystocia) at delivery, and therefore, growth should be carefully monitored in the latter stages of pregnancy and appropriate arrangements for delivery should be made (TABLE 4, R23,24). BWSp is also associated with polyhydramnios and premature birth. Potential post-delivery complications such as neonatal hypoglycaemia, respiratory obstruction from macroglossia, surgical repair of exomphalos and so on should be anticipated, and appropriate monitoring and facilities should be put in place.When a prenatal diagnosis of BWSp is suspected or confirmed, the management of individual congenital anomalies (for example, exomphalos or cardiac defect) generally follows standard protocols based on usual local practices.

        <p>Although prenatal and postnatal overgrowth have been considered to be cardinal features in previous reports, overgrowth occurs in only 43-65% of patients 118 .

Postnatal growth is generally in the upper part of the normal range but usually slows in late childhood, and differences in growth trajectories between children with BWSp and those without it should be considered when making predictions of adult height. However, growth trajectories have not been well reported in patients with BWSp, and specific growth charts are needed (TABLE 4,R25). Although few data on final adult height are available, one study reported that final adult height was higher than parental target height, with a mean distance to target height of 1.7 ± 1.1 SDS and approximately one-half of the patients having height SDS &gt;2 (REF. 15) (TABLE 4, R26). Advanced bone age is infrequent (~3%) 119,120 , and to date, there are no data regarding treatment of tall stature in cohorts of patients with BWSp (TABLE 4, R27).Although prenatal and postnatal overgrowth have been considered to be cardinal features in previous reports, overgrowth occurs in only 43-65% of patients 118 .

        <p>Of children diagnosed with classical BWS, 90% have macroglossia, and BWSp is the most common cause of macroglossia in childhood 124 . Although macroglossia might appear to regress spontaneously in some children (from a combination of a decrease in growth velocity and an increase in growth of the mandible), ~40% of children with BWS undergo a surgical tongue reduction 125 . The most common indications for surgery are problems with feeding; persistent drooling; difficulties with articulation; orthodontic problems, including prognathism and development of an anterior open-bite and incisor spacing and/or flaring; and psychosocial difficulties resulting from abnormal cosmetic appearance and difficulties with speech, feeding and drooling [126][127][128]Of children diagnosed with classical BWS, 90% have macroglossia, and BWSp is the most common cause of macroglossia in childhood 124 .

        <p>In rare cases, respiratory problems might require surgery to be performed in the neonatal period, and preoperative tracheostomy might be required 125 . When obstructive sleep apnoea is suspected, an airway evaluation and appropriate further investigation with polysomnography can be used for objective assessment 130,131 (TABLE 4, R33).

A variety of anomalies have been described; cortical and medullary cysts occur in ~10% of patients with BWSp and the prevalence of hypercalciuria and nephrolithiasis is increased compared with that in the general population 147 . Although not all nephrourological anomalies detected by ultrasonography will be of clinical importance, a minority of anomalies might be severe (and usually detectable prenatally) and require medical or surgical management.

        <p>Renal anomalies might occur in all molecular subtypes of BWSp, but only certain groups might be offered regular renal imaging for tumour surveillance. Management of the nephro-urological aspects of BWSp should be pragmatic and balance the benefits of presymptomatic diagnosis and treatment of critical obstructions and urinary tract infections for preserving renal function with the drawbacks of over-investigation for benign variants detected by surveillance. Thus, we recommend a nephro-urological evaluation at clinical diagnosis and at the time of adult transition for any patient with BWSp and screening for nephrocalcinosis and/or stones in only patients who undergo abdominal USS for tumour screening (TABLE 4, R51-55).Renal anomalies might occur in all molecular subtypes of BWSp, but only certain groups might be offered regular renal imaging for tumour surveillance.

        <p>Embryonal tumours occur in ~8% of children with BWSp 149 . The most common types of embryonal tumours are Wilms tumour (52% of all tumours), hepatoblastoma (14% of all tumours), neuroblastoma (10% of all tumours), rhabdomyosarcoma (5% of all tumours) and adrenal carcinoma (3% of all tumours) 14 . Although there are some differences in mean age at diagnosis between tumour types, the overall cancer risk is highest in the first 2 years of life, and clinical experience suggests that the cancer risk then declines progressively before puberty, approaching the cancer risk of the general population. Currently, there is no evidence of an increased risk of malignant tumours in adulthood (Supplementary information S4 (table )).Embryonal tumours occur in ~8% of children with BWSp 149 .

        <p>The tumour risk correlates with the BWSp molecular subgroup; patients with segmental upd (11)pat and IC1 GOM have a higher tumour risk than patients with CDKN1C mutations and IC2 LOM 58 . The four main molecular subgroups are characterized by a cancer risk gradient, with the highest risk in cases of IC1 GOM (28% risk), followed by segmental upd (11)pat (16% risk), CDKN1C mutation (6.9% risk) and IC2 LOM (2.6% risk) 14 . In addition, there are also differences in the tumour types observed between molecular subgroups. Patients with IC1 GOM are mostly predisposed to developing Wilms tumour (observed in 24% of patients and accounting for 95% of malignancies in this group) 14,15,149 . Conversely, patients with IC2 LOM and CDKN1C mutations do not usually develop Wilms tumour but rather develop other tumours such as hepatoblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma. Thus, a study from 2016 reported a prevalence of Wilms tumour of ~0.2% (2/995) in patients BWSp and IC2 LOM 149 ; although a report from 2017 suggested that the risk of Wilms tumour in patients with IC2 LOM is underestimated, only a single patient with Wilms tumour and an IC2 epimutation was observed 150 . Therefore, when put together with previous reports of Wilms tumour in large cohorts of patients with BWSp, the overall prevalence of Wilms tumour with IC2 LOM is probably well below 1% 151 . Patients with CDKN1C mutations are mostly predisposed to neuroblastoma 14,15,149 . Patients with segmental upd (11) pat are predisposed to develop any of the tumour types seen in BWSp (TABLE 5). Individuals with genome-wide paternal UPD seem to have a high risk of developing tumour types similar to those with segmental upd (11) pat but with an increased incidence of hepatic and/or adrenal tumours extending into adolescence and young adulthood 63,64,137,152 .The tumour risk correlates with the BWSp molecular subgroup; patients with segmental upd (11)pat and IC1 GOM have a higher tumour risk than patients with CDKN1C mutations and IC2 LOM 58 .

        <p>Tumour screening in patients with inherited cancer predisposition syndromes aims to improve patient survival and reduce morbidity through earlier detection of tumours. However, no surveillance protocol can detect every tumour, and there are both benefits and drawbacks to screening -the latter include the financial costs, morbidity that can result from investigating asymptomatic benign lesions detected on surveillance and psychosocial burden of repeated investigations for the patient and family. There is no generally accepted risk threshold for instigating tumour screening strategies, and it might vary according to regional medical and medicolegal practices and local health-care systems. Although screening is considered for a tumour risk &gt;1% in the USA, a risk of 5% might be considered an appropriate threshold in Europe 10,154 . Various protocols have been suggested for tumour surveillance in BWSp, usually comprising abdominal USS with or without measurement of AFP levels at various ages and intervals during infancy 14,15,155 . Traditionally, although most protocols have been applied to all cases of BWSp, the definition of specific epigenotype-tumour risk correlations provides a basis for more targeted surveillance protocols.Tumour screening in patients with inherited cancer predisposition syndromes aims to improve patient survival and reduce morbidity through earlier detection of tumours.

        <p>Screening for Wilms tumour. Abdominal USS is the preferred modality for Wilms tumour screening. The doubling time of Wilms tumour cells has been estimated to be 11-13 days 156 , and USS is recommended every 3-4 months 157,158 . Given the high survival of individuals with Wilms tumour (90% overall survival at 4 years), early detection of Wilms tumour by surveillance is predicted to only marginally impact survival; however, diagnosis at an earlier stage might reduce the burden of treatment-related morbidity [159][160][161][162] .Screening for Wilms tumour.

        <p>Screening for hepatoblastoma. The risk of hepatoblastoma in patients with BWS is &gt;2,000-fold higher than in the general population, and hepatoblastoma is the second most common tumour type in BWS 21 . However, specific studies evaluating hepatoblastoma screening in BWSp are lacking. Abdominal USS is a first-line investigation in children with a suspected liver mass, although not all parts of the liver can be imaged easily and small tumours might be missed 159 . Concerns about the sensitivity of abdominal USS led to suggestions that it should be combined with measurements of serum levels of AFP, which is secreted by &gt;95% of hepatoblastomas [163][164][165] . Treatment and outcome of patients with hepatoblastoma are closely connected to tumour stage at diagnosis, and preliminary data suggested that patients with BWSp and hepatoblastoma who are screened for AFP have an earlier stage at diagnosis and a better prognosis than unscreened patients and that increased serum AFP levels might precede hepatoblastoma detection by USS 166 . However, this hypothesis is unproved, and further data are required. In the paediatric setting, interpreting serum AFP levels can be complex owing to the wide range and variable concentrations in early infancy 167,168 . Serum AFP levels might be higher in babies with BWSp and without hepatoblastoma than in agematched healthy controls 169 . In view of the burden of repeated venepuncture and the complexity of interpreting elevated AFP levels, it has been debated whether the benefits of AFP screening in BWSp outweigh the drawbacks [170][171][172][173] , and the consensus voted not to recommend AFP screening (TABLE 4, R64).Screening for hepatoblastoma.

        <p>BWSp molecular subgroups, neuroblastomas are preferentially associated with CDKN1C mutations, with a frequency of ~4% 14 (TABLE 5). Detection of asymptomatic neuroblastomas by determination of the urinary tumour markers vanillylmandelic acid and homo vanillic acid and/or the catecholamine to creatinine ratio combined with three monthly USSs until age 2-3 years has been suggested 149 . However, previous neuroblastoma screening strategies using urinary markers in largescale paediatric settings had a very minor influence on the related morbidity and mortality 174,175 , and there is currently no evidence that neuroblastoma screening in BWSp improves treatment and survival ( 5). It was agreed that AFP measurements should not be offered routinely because the incidence of hepatoblastoma was judged too low to warrant specific screening, the influence of surveillance of patients and families is unclear, and the difficulties in interpretation might lead to false-positive results (TABLE 4, R64). Nevertheless, in specific health-care systems, clinicians might currently vary from the proposed protocol, especially when regional protocols are available, pending the outcome of the results of prospective studies of targeted and universal surveillance.BWSp molecular subgroups, neuroblastomas are preferentially associated with CDKN1C mutations, with a frequency of ~4% 14 (TABLE 5).

        <p>The consensus surveillance protocol enables ~50% of children with BWSp at low tumour risk to be spared 3 monthly USSs, and although the risk of Wilms tumour, for example, is small in patients with a CDKN1C mutation, applying a common surveillance modality (abdominal USS rather than renal USS in some subgroups, liver USS in other subgroups and so on) in all the groups to be screened avoids the potential for confusion with more complicated regimens. It should be noted that the agreed protocol differs from that recommended recently by the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Childhood Cancer Predisposition Workshop, which adopted a 1% risk threshold for surveillance and therefore recommended abdominal USS and AFP screening for all cases of BWSp 155 . Both the AACR group and this consensus group made these decisions on the basis of similar data for tumour risks in different molecular subgroups but came to differing conclusions with regard to adopting a targeted screening approach. It should be noted that the AACR group consisted predominantly of experts from North America, whereas the international BWS consensus group was composed predominantly of experts from European centres, where targeted screening has already been adopted in some countries 14,154 . Thus, the difference in screening recommendations between the two groups reflects mainly the different medical and medicolegal cultures in North America and Europe. Although a universally agreed upon screening protocol would usually be preferable, taking into account the different conclusions between the experts of both the AACR group and this consensus group, it is reasonable that at this time, screening protocols could be different between Europe and North America. Such diversity of practice can be helpful, as careful audit of the results of the two protocols can help further refine our recommendations at future international consensus meetings 155 .The consensus surveillance protocol enables ~50% of children with BWSp at low tumour risk to be spared 3 monthly USSs, and although the risk of Wilms tumour, for example, is small in patients with a CDKN1C mutation, applying a common surveillance modality (abdominal USS rather than renal USS in some subgroups, liver USS in other subgroups and so on) in all the groups to be screened avoids the potential for confusion with more complicated regimens.

        <p>Children with BWSp and Wilms tumour, when compared with non-syndromic children with Wilms tumour, present with less metastatic disease because of earlier stage disease, fewer anaplastic tumours and a higher incidence of bilateral synchronous or metachronous recurrence 161 (TABLE 4, R67).

The consensus group agreed that a detailed clinical review and renal USS (Supplementary information S5 (table)) should be undertaken at age 16 years, and specific recommendations for continued surveillance based on only ongoing problems were agreed upon (TABLE 4, R68). Adults with BWSp should be encouraged to seek genetic counselling advice before starting a family (TABLE 4, R69).

        <p>The diagnosis of a disorder such as BWSp can have wide-ranging effects on the psychological and social well-being of families. Although the precise effects will vary between families and will be influenced by individual medical and social factors, and considering that each family might face different challenges, it is important that all health-care professionals are aware of the wider non-medical issues that might be relevant to the family (TABLE 4, R71). Information on the psychosocial aspects that might be specific to BWSp is sparse. In many cases, there is no previous relevant family history and the parents are not prepared for the diagnosis. Issues such as tumour risk can be worrying, and it is apparent that differing medical practices and recommendations might cause parental uncertainty and anxiety. A survey of parents of children with BWSp who have macroglossia revealed widespread parental concerns about the 'negative cosmetic appearances' of a large protruding tongue and persistent drooling, which led to strangers staring and questioning whether their children had learning difficulties 128 . Parents are also concerned that this might lead to teasing by other children, and a retrospective questionnaire survey revealed an apparent increase in emotional difficulties and problems with peers in children with BWSp 183 . Health-care professionals should be aware that psychosocial difficulties might occur and should be prepared to refer families to specialists such as genetic counsellors, social workers and psychologists, as appropriate. As support groups can have key roles in helping families adjust to the diagnosis, share their concerns and experiences and obtain the correct care and support, all families should be given the contact details of relevant groups (TABLE 4, R72).The diagnosis of a disorder such as BWSp can have wide-ranging effects on the psychological and social well-being of families.

        <p>The recommendations of the first international BWS consensus group described in this Consensus Statement provide a framework for improving the diagnosis and management of BWSp. As BWSp is characterized by complex genetics and variable multisystem phenotypes, it is important that a lead clinician is identified for each patient (TABLE 4, R22) to ensure coordination of the numerous aspects of care throughout childhood (Supplementary information S5 (table )). The proposed diagnostic and care pathways are intended to be practical and cost-effective (for example, targeting tumour surveillance to high-risk groups should reduce costs compared with universal surveillance strategies). Nevertheless, in some health-care systems and medicolegal environments, further evidence might be required to shift clinical practice (for example, tumour surveillance in North America). Thus, it is important that implementation of these consensus recommendations be accompanied by prospective audits in order to expand the evidence base for future consensus initiatives.The recommendations of the first international BWS consensus group described in this Consensus Statement provide a framework for improving the diagnosis and management of BWSp.
