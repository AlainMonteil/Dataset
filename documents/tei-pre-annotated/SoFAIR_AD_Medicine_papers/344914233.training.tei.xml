        <p>Introduction Transmission of COVID-19 within families and close contacts accounts for the majority of epidemic growth. Community mask wearing, hand washing and social distancing are thought to be effective but there is little evidence to inform or support community members on COVID-19 risk reduction within families. Methods A retrospective cohort study of 335 people in 124 families and with at least one laboratory confirmed COVID-19 case was conducted from 28 February to 27 March 2020, in Beijing, China. The outcome of interest was secondary transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within the family. Characteristics and practices of primary cases, of well family contacts and household hygiene practices were analysed as predictors of secondary transmission. results The secondary attack rate in families was 23.0% (77/335). Face mask use by the primary case and family contacts before the primary case developed symptoms was 79% effective in reducing transmission (OR=0.21, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.79). Daily use of chlorine or ethanol based disinfectant in households was 77% effective (OR=0.23, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.84). Wearing a mask after illness onset of the primary case was not significantly protective. The risk of household transmission was 18 times higher with frequent daily close contact with the primary case (OR=18.26, 95% CI 3.93 to 84.79), and four times higher if the primary case had diarrhoea (OR=4.10, 95% CI 1.08 to 15.60). Household crowding was not significant.Introduction Transmission of COVID-19 within families and close contacts accounts for the majority of epidemic growth.

Face masks were 79% effective and disinfection was 77% effective in preventing transmission, while close frequent contact in the household increased the risk of transmission 18 times, and diarrhoea in the index patient increased the risk by four times. The results demonstrate the importance of the pre-symptomatic infectiousness of COVID-19 patients and shows that wearing masks after illness onset does not protect.► The overall secondary attack rate in households was 23.0%.

However, the World Health Organization and Public Health England recommend against UFMU on the grounds that there is little evidence from randomised controlled trials to support this. Some experts suggest that in a pandemic, the precautionary principle should be used and UFMU encouraged as it is unlikely to cause harm and may result in public health gain. 3 4 In countries where personal protective equipment is scarce, people are making their own masks.In the USA, the use of face masks in the community has been recommended. 2 It is thought that universal face mask use (UFMU) may reduce outward transmission from asymptomatically infected people and protect well people from becoming infected.

        <p>We conducted a retrospective cohort study involving families of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases in Beijing, China. We defined family members as those who had lived with primary cases in a house for 4 days before and for more than 24 hours after the primary cases developed illness related to COVID-19. As of 21 February 2020, all laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in Beijing were enrolled in our study and followed-up. The outcome of interest was secondary transmission in the household. Families with secondary transmission were defined as those where some or all of the family members become infected within one incubation period (2 weeks) of symptom onset of the primary case.We conducted a retrospective cohort study involving families of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases in Beijing, China.

        <p>This study confirms that the highest risk of household transmission is prior to symptom onset, but that precautionary NPIs, such as mask use, disinfection and social distancing in households can prevent COVID-19 transmission during the pandemic. This study is the first to confirm the effectiveness of mask use prior to symptom onset by family members, daily household disinfection and social distancing in the home. This could inform precautionary guidelines for families to reduce intrafamilial transmission in areas where there is high community transmission or other risk factors for COVID-19. Household transmission is a major driver of epidemic growth. 5 6 Further, in countries where health system capacity is exhausted, many people with infection are required to self-isolate at home, where their household contacts will be at risk of infection. In our study, the median family size of the 124 families was 4 (range 2-9), usually with children, parents and grandparents, which is similar to the social structure of most Chinese families. 9 Therefore, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 household transmission is high if a primary case was introduced and no measure was adopted. We showed that NPIs are effective at preventing transmission, even in homes that are crowded and small. UFMU is a low risk intervention with potential public health benefits. 3 4 The results suggest that community face mask use is likely to be the most effective inside the household during severe epidemics. Almost a quarter of family members became infected, and the findings suggest that the risk was highest either before symptom onset or early in the clinical illness, as most primary cases were hospitalised after diagnosis, and interventions were not effective if applied after symptom onset. In the univariate analysis, wearing a mask after illness onset was significant, but in multivariate analysis, only wearing it before symptom onset was effective. Viral load is highest in the 2 days before symptom onset and on the first day of symptoms, and up to 44% of transmission is during the pre-symptomatic period in settings with substantial household clustering. 10 11 This supports UFMU, probably by reducing onward transmission from people in the pre-symptomatic phase of the illness 12 13 as well as protecting well mask users. Randomised clinical trials of face masks in the household have confirmed protection against other respiratory viruses if compliant, if used within 36 hours of the primary case symptom onset, and alone or in combination with hand hygiene. 14 15 This study now provides specific evidence for UFMU in settings of high epidemic growth to protect against COVID-19. In our study, 91.2% (103/113) of primary cases had a high score on hand hygiene, but it was not effective, confirming the results of previous randomised clinical trials which showed hand BMJ Global Health hygiene alone did not protect against respiratory transmissible viruses, but masks combined with hand hygiene did have effect. 16 As the compliance of UFMU would be poor in the home, there was difficulty and also no necessity for everyone to wear masks at home. We recommended that those families with members who were at risk of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 (such as ever having contact with a COVID-19 patient, medical workers caring for a COVID-19 patient or having a history of travelling to high risk areas) should apply UFMU to reduce the risk of household transmission.This study confirms that the highest risk of household transmission is prior to symptom onset, but that precautionary NPIs, such as mask use, disinfection and social distancing in households can prevent COVID-19 transmission during the pandemic.

        <p>Household transmission in the pre-symptomatic or early symptomatic period of COVID-19 is a driver of epidemic growth and any measure aimed at reducing this can flatten the curve. This study reinforces the high risk of transmission in households but importantly shows that UFMU and hygiene measures can significantly reduce the risk of household transmission of COVID-19, independent of household size or crowding. This is the first study to show the effectiveness of precautionary mask use, social distancing and regular disinfection in the household, and can inform guidelines for prevention of household transmission. The results may also be informative for families of high risk groups, such as health workers, quarantined individuals or situations where cases of COVID-19 have to be managed at home.Household transmission in the pre-symptomatic or early symptomatic period of COVID-19 is a driver of epidemic growth and any measure aimed at reducing this can flatten the curve.
