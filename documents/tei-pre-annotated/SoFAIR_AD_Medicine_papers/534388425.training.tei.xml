        <p>lished treatment guidelines for bipolar disorder in 2005, along with international commentaries and subsequent updates in 2007, 2009, and 2013. The last two updates were published in collaboration with the International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD). These 2018 CANMAT and ISBD Bipolar Treatment Guidelines represent the significant advances in the field since the last full edition was published in 2005, including updates to diagnosis and management as well as new research into pharmacological and psychological treatments. These advances have been translated into clear and easy to use recommendations for first , second, and third-line treatments, with consideration given to levels of evidence for efficacy, clinical support based on experience, and consensus ratings of safety, tolerability, and treatment-emergent switch risk. New to these guidelines, hierarchical rankings were created for first and second-line treatments recommended for acute mania, acute depression, and maintenance treatment in bipolar I disorder. Created by considering the impact of each treatment across all phases of illness, this hierarchy will further assist clinicians in making evidence-based treatment decisions. Lithium, quetiapine, divalproex, asenapine, aripiprazole, paliperidone, risperidone, and cariprazine alone or in combination are recommended as firstline treatments for acute mania. First-line options for bipolar I depression include quetiapine, lurasidone plus lithium or divalproex, lithium, lamotrigine, lurasidone, or adjunctive lamotrigine. While medications that have been shown to be effective for the acute phase should generally be continued for the maintenance phase in bipolar I disorder, there are some exceptions (such as with antidepressants); and available data suggest that lithium, quetiapine, divalproex, lamotrigine, asenapine, and aripiprazole monotherapy or combination treatments should be considered first-line for those initiating or switching treatment during the maintenance phase. In addition to addressing issues in bipolar I disorder, these guidelines also provide an overview of, and recommendations for, clinical management of bipolar II disorder, as well as advice on specific populations, such as women at various stages of the reproductive cycle, children and adolescents, and older adults. There are also discussions on the impact of specific psychiatric and medical comorbidities such as substance use, anxiety, and metabolic disorders. Finally, an overview of issues related to safety and monitoring is provided. The CANMAT and ISBD groups hope that these guidelines become a valuable tool for practitioners across the globe.lished treatment guidelines for bipolar disorder in 2005, along with international commentaries and subsequent updates in 2007, 2009, and 2013.

        <p>In the 20 years since the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) first published guidelines on the management of BD (BD), 1 there has been an explosion of research on treatment of this illness. During this time period, CANMAT has strived to translate advances in research into international consensus on evidence-based clinical management; first by publishing 2005 guidelines accompanied by expert commentaries, then by providing updates in 2007, 2 2009 3 and 2013 4 in collaboration with the International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD). The main objective of these publications was to synthesize the wealth of evidence on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the range of interventions available for this complex and varied illness, with the goal of providing clear, easy to use recommendations for clinicians to improve outcomes in their patients.In the 20 years since the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) first published guidelines on the management of BD (BD), 1 there has been an explosion of research on treatment of this illness.

        <p>Given that 13 years have elapsed since the publication of the last full edition in 2005, the objective of these 2018 CANMAT and ISBD Bipolar Disorder Management Guidelines is to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date review of research evidence on the treatment of various phases of BD, translated into clinical recommendations for evidence-based management. Updated principles related to diagnosis and management are also included, in response to significant changes made in the 5 th edition of the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental DisordersGiven that 13 years have elapsed since the publication of the last full edition in 2005, the objective of these 2018 CANMAT and ISBD Bipolar Disorder Management Guidelines is to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date review of research evidence on the treatment of various phases of BD, translated into clinical recommendations for evidence-based management.

        <p>As with previous editions of CANMAT guidelines, clinical support for efficacy was an important consideration in arriving at the final treatment recommendations (Table 2). Major conflicting data are addressed in blue text boxes (figures) to clarify the rationale for arriving at a specific level of evidence for efficacy.As with previous editions of CANMAT guidelines, clinical support for efficacy was an important consideration in arriving at the final treatment recommendations (Table 2).

        <p>In the current edition, an additional distinction is made between safety and tolerability, and a consensus rating is assigned to each medication on these two measures when used in both the acute and maintenance phase. Further, a rating is also assigned to each medication for its propensity to switch patients into mania or depression (treatment-emergent switch). More information on these ratings can be found in the respective treatment sections, as well as in Section 8.In the current edition, an additional distinction is made between safety and tolerability, and a consensus rating is assigned to each medication on these two measures when used in both the acute and maintenance phase.

        <p>The final grading of recommendations into first, second, or thirdline considers levels of evidence for efficacy, clinical support based on experience, and consensus ratings of safety, tolerability, and risk of treatment-emergent switch. In addition, hierarchical rankings were created and are listed in the tables for first and second line recommendations for acute mania, depression and maintenance treatment in bipolar I disorder (BDI). This hierarchy was created by considering the impact of each treatment across all phases of illness (Figure 1).The final grading of recommendations into first, second, or thirdline considers levels of evidence for efficacy, clinical support based on experience, and consensus ratings of safety, tolerability, and risk of treatment-emergent switch.

        <p>The rationale for the hierarchical approach is that BD is a chronic lifetime condition with recurrent mood episodes and subsyndromal mood symptoms, and most if not all patients will require maintenance treatment. Since treatments that are prescribed for an acute mood episode are usually continued into maintenance treatment, maintenance efficacy should be considered when choosing acute-phase treatments.The rationale for the hierarchical approach is that BD is a chronic lifetime condition with recurrent mood episodes and subsyndromal mood symptoms, and most if not all patients will require maintenance treatment.

        <p>Treatments that have demonstrated efficacy across the spectrum of the illness should thus be tried first before treatments that have demonstrated efficacy for only selective phases of the disorder. As an example, if two treatments are shown to be similarly effective in acute mania, and if only one of these treatments has demonstrated efficacy for maintenance treatment, the treatment with evidence for maintenance would be placed higher in the hierarchical ranking.Treatments that have demonstrated efficacy across the spectrum of the illness should thus be tried first before treatments that have demonstrated efficacy for only selective phases of the disorder.

        <p>Of note, when a treatment is listed as a monotherapy, that implies that it may be used on its own or in combination with other ongoing treatments, even if there are no specific studies demonstrating the efficacy of that combination. In this situation, the assumption is that the previous ongoing treatment was partially effective, and the addition of the new agent will provide benefits in either an additive or synergistic manner. In contrast, agents specifically listed as adjunctive therapy may have no evidence for efficacy as monotherapy, and/or may have safety concerns if prescribed as monotherapy (eg. antidepressants), and are only recommended for use in combination with other evidence-based agents.Of note, when a treatment is listed as a monotherapy, that implies that it may be used on its own or in combination with other ongoing treatments, even if there are no specific studies demonstrating the efficacy of that combination.

        <p>As with previous editions, these guidelines also have a "not recommended" category which includes treatments that have clearly been shown to be ineffective in double-blind RCTs. Further, we have included another category called "no specific recommendation/agents that require further study" to list treatments with insufficient evidence or clinical experience to make a recommendation, or where there is a reason to believe that negative trials failed because of methodological problems-especially when the results are inconsistent with what is expected based on the pharmacological properties of treatment and clinical experience. Inclusion in this category means the efficacy of these agents is unknown at this time.As with previous editions, these guidelines also have a "not recommended" category which includes treatments that have clearly been shown to be ineffective in double-blind RCTs.

        <p>Bipolar disorder encompasses a spectrum of diagnostic subgroups primarily divided according to the severity of mood elevation experienced during acute episodes 5 On this spectrum, BDI is placed at one pole due to the presence of threshold manic episodes in which features include inflated self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, racing thoughts, distractibility, psychomotor agitation, and risky behaviour that leads to significant functional impairment, and may include psychotic features, and/or necessitate hospitalization. At the other end of the spectrum, cyclothymia is characterized by subthreshold presentation of hypomanic and depressive symptoms that, while chronic, do not meet diagnostic criteria for a major depressive episode or manic/hypomanic episode. BDII sits between the two conditions with hypomanic episodes qualitatively like manic periods but, although distinct and observable, are not of a sufficient duration or severity to cause significant functional impairment, hospitalization, or psychosis. Individuals with BDII also experience threshold depressive episodes.Bipolar disorder encompasses a spectrum of diagnostic subgroups primarily divided according to the severity of mood elevation experienced during acute episodes 5 On this spectrum, BDI is placed at one pole due to the presence of threshold manic episodes in which features include inflated self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, racing thoughts, distractibility, psychomotor agitation, and risky behaviour that leads to significant functional impairment, and may include psychotic features, and/or necessitate hospitalization.

        <p>DSM-5 also includes a range of specifiers that clinicians may use to further clarify the specific course, severity, and features of BDs. While a more detailed description can be found in the DSM-5 manual, the available specifiers and their use across the spectrum are listed in Table 5. Many of these specifiers may also be used to guide treatment decisions for acute mania (Section 3) and depression (Section 4). Amongst these, the mixed features specifier, which has replaced mixed episodes, warrants consideration because of the multiple and complex presentations of mixed states it can give rise to. Furthermore, the nascency of this terminology has meant that treatment data are as yet sparse. DSM-5 has added mixed features as a specifier during an episode of major depressive disorder (MDD) as well, which will probably pose some pragmatic diagnostic challenges and management dilemmas for clinicians.DSM-5 also includes a range of specifiers that clinicians may use to further clarify the specific course, severity, and features of BDs.

        <p>The course of BD is heterogeneous but, on average, the risk of recurrence increases with the number of previous episodes. 28 In addition, data examining the effect of episodes on the course of illness shows that the number of previous episodes is associated with increased duration and symptomatic severity of subsequent episodes. Moreover, the number of episodes is associated with a decreased threshold for developing further episodes and with an increased risk of dementia in the long term. 28 The progressive course of illness in patients with multiple episodes is called clinical progression and the biological basis of clinical progression is defined as neuroprogression. 28,29 The concepts of clinical progression and neuroprogression have provided the basis for the development of staging systems in BD. 30 Overall, the staging models describe three broad clinical stages: (I) individuals at increased risk for developing BD due to family history as well as certain subsyndromal symptoms predictive of conversion into full-blown BD; (II) patients with fewer episodes and optimal functioning in the interepisodic periods, and (III) patients with recurrent episodes as well as decline in functioning and cognition. 31 So far, the heterogeneity intrinsic to BD has prevented the clinical use of staging systems. 32 In addition, the field of staging is in its infancy and the ability of staging systems to guide prognosis and treatment is still to be determined. Overall, the model of staging has helped clinicians to appreciate the importance of early identification and treatment as well as illness trajectories in BD. 33The course of BD is heterogeneous but, on average, the risk of recurrence increases with the number of previous episodes. 28 In addition, data examining the effect of episodes on the course of illness shows that the number of previous episodes is associated with increased duration and symptomatic severity of subsequent episodes.

        <p>Due to frequent depressive onset, variable help seeking for hypomanic or manic periods, temporal instability of symptoms, and high rates of comorbidity; accurate the timely identification of BD can be difficult to achieve in many cases. Indeed, many individuals are not accurately diagnosed until up to 10 years after the onset of symptoms, with one to four alternate diagnoses typically being given prior to correct recognition and treatment 34,35 This delay has important consequences, including inadequate initial treatment and worse prognosis in terms of episode recurrence and functional outcome. 36,37 The most frequent misdiagnosis is that of MDD, as patients are more likely to present for the treatment of depressive symptoms and may not recall periods of hypomania or mania, or may not interpret them as being pathological. Recall and insight are particularly impaired during periods of acute depression, with pronounced memory or concentration difficulties. There are several features of depression that may increase suspicion of bipolarity, and prompt more careful investigation, including earlier age of illness onset, highly recurrent depressive episodes, a family history of BD, depression with psychotic features, psychomotor agitation, atypical depressive symptoms such as hypersomnia, hyperphagia, and leaden paralysis, postpartum depression and psychosis, past suicide attempts, and antidepressant-induced manic symptoms or rapid cycling (Table 6) Given the recent change in DSM-5 to allow the possibility of depression symptoms with subthreshold simultaneous hypomanic symptoms (mixed specifier), it is also important to explore if an individual is experiencing mixed symptoms. 38,39 Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders are the second most T A B L E 5 DSM-5 specifiers for bipolar and related disordersDue to frequent depressive onset, variable help seeking for hypomanic or manic periods, temporal instability of symptoms, and high rates of comorbidity; accurate the timely identification of BD can be difficult to achieve in many cases.

        <p>Current episode severity X X common misdiagnosis, occurring as the initial diagnosis in as many as 30% of patients. 40 In addition to this under-diagnosis, there are also concerns that BD may be over-diagnosed in some circumstances. 41 For instance, the symptoms of borderline personality disorder, substance use disorder (SUD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) overlap significantly those of hypomania/mania, and some reports suggest that patients with these conditions often get misdiagnosed with BD. These conditions also are often comorbid with BD, which makes the diagnosis of this condition often challenging. 42 Validated self-report instruments, such as the Mood Disorders Questionnaire (MDQ), may be used as a screening tool to flag patients for whom a more detailed assessment is needed. It is important to note, that such tools have poor sensitivity and specificity, especially in community or highly comorbid populations, and will thus have an elevated risk of also flagging those with borderline traits. 43 As such, tools such as the MDQ should be used only as an adjunct for screening clinical populations and not for diagnostic or treatment planning purposes.Current episode severity X X common misdiagnosis, occurring as the initial diagnosis in as many as 30% of patients. 40 In addition to this under-diagnosis, there are also concerns that BD may be over-diagnosed in some circumstances. 41 For instance, the symptoms of borderline personality disorder, substance use disorder (SUD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) overlap significantly those of hypomania/mania, and some reports suggest that patients with these conditions often get misdiagnosed with BD.

        <p>To improve the accuracy of diagnosis, it is important that clinicians strictly adhere to diagnostic criteria rather than relying on heuristics. 44 It is important to complete a careful psychiatric history, including in first-degree relatives, with attention paid to any suspected periods of increased activity, irritability, or other change in behaviours. Collateral information from friends and family members should be included wherever possible. Ongoing monitoring of symptoms, such as mood charting, can also help to detect bipolarity that may only become apparent over time. Confirmation of the diagnosis can then be made more confidently when episodes are prospectively observed.To improve the accuracy of diagnosis, it is important that clinicians strictly adhere to diagnostic criteria rather than relying on heuristics. 44 It is important to complete a careful psychiatric history, including in first-degree relatives, with attention paid to any suspected periods of increased activity, irritability, or other change in behaviours.

        <p>It is important for clinicians to frequently monitor suicidal ideation and risk.

        <p>Factors reported to be significantly associated with suicidal attempt include female sex, younger age of illness onset, depressive polarity of first illness episode, depressive polarity of current or more recent episode, comorbid anxiety disorder, comorbid SUD, comorbid cluster B/borderline personality disorder, first-degree family history of suicide, and previous suicide attempts. Only male sex and first-degree family history of suicide have been significantly associated with suicide deaths. 50,51 The periods during and following hospital admission further represent times of particularly high risk, with 14% of suicides occurring during an inpatient stay and another 26% within 6 weeks of discharge. 47,52 A comprehensive assessment for suicide risk should occur during all clinical interactions. Risk stratification using assessment tools is not sufficiently accurate for prediction of suicide risk in clinical use; instead, clinical assessment should focus on modifiable risk factors that could be targeted to reduce the risk. 53 The ISBD has developed clinical tips and patient information sheets (translated into several languages) that can be useful tools for clinicians, patients and families to develop a comprehensive approach to suicide prevention (http://www.isbd.Factors reported to be significantly associated with suicidal attempt include female sex, younger age of illness onset, depressive polarity of first illness episode, depressive polarity of current or more recent episode, comorbid anxiety disorder, comorbid SUD, comorbid cluster B/borderline personality disorder, first-degree family history of suicide, and previous suicide attempts.

For relapse prevention, four significant RCTs of varying sizes have been conducted, delivered to a mixed audience of young adults and adolescents. 95 In these studies, FFT demonstrated efficacy in reducing recurrence of new episodes of depression, but not mania. Overall, FFT is recommended as adjunctive second-line treatment for acute depression (level 2) and for maintenance (level 2). No evidence exists, and hence no recommendation is made, for FFT for mania.For acute bipolar depression in adults, an intensive FFT (up to 30 sessions; mean 14) out-performed a three-session control condition, 94 although this study was limited by the caveats identified for CBT and IPSRT.

        <p>IPSRT expands on the IPT focus on grief, interpersonal role transition, role dispute, and interpersonal deficits by including regulation of social and sleep rhythms, specifically targeted to the bipolar population. It is typically delivered in 24 individual sessions over 9 months. 96,97 Few controlled trials of IPSRT have been conducted, with limited evidence of acute efficacy. The first, large trial 98 showed no effect of IPSRT compared to a control condition but did show benefit for reduction of relapse and improved occupational functioning. An acute bipolar depression study 84 showed intensive IPSRT (up to 30 sessions; mean 14) out-performed a three-session control condition, but it is impossible to state whether the performance was related to the intensity and number of sessions, changes in medication use, or specific attributes of IPSRT. Two small studies failed to demonstrate specific benefits of IPSRT compared to control conditions. 99,100 Other open studies have shown some pre-post benefits in very small samples. [101][102][103] Again, since many psychosocial treatments for bipolar disorder share common core elements that may be psychoeducational, it is possible that the relapse prevention aspects of psychoeducation may also result from IPSRT interventions, mediated by the same therapeutic processes. 104 Overall, IPSRT is recommended as an adjunctive third-line treatment for acute depression and for maintenance, based on limited (effect size and small sample size) level 2 evidence in each phase.

        <p>Although somewhat like FFT, family/caregiver interventions constitute a distinctly different psychosocial intervention in that the intervention is given to the family/caregiver, not the person with BD, and evidence exists that such interventions improve clinical outcomes in the patient. 75,113 Clinical wisdom and common practice, however, support the importance of family or caregivers being included in at least some sessions with the patient (particularly for psychoeducation), both to reduce symptom burden on the individual with BD and to reduce burnout and emotional burden on the caregiver.

In a large RCT, FR was shown to have a substantial impact on functioning, in comparison to treatment as usual. 117 Coupled with the results of other small studies involving other interventions, these findings suggest that there is considerable hope in addressing cognitive and functional deficits in BD. 118 Computer-based cognitive remediation, though, may show positive effects on cognition but not on functioning. 119Functional impairment as well as cognitive deficits are found in many individuals with BD, not just during an acute episode but even between episodes, prompting the evaluation of various psychosocial and biological strategies to address these problems.

        <p>DSM-5 has eliminated the categorical "mixed episode" specifier, replacing it with the more dimensional "mixed features". DSM-5 also includes other specifiers that can accompany a manic episode: anxious distress, rapid cycling, mood-congruent or mood-incongruent psychotic features, catatonia, peripartum onset, and seasonal pattern (Table 5). The utility of several of these specifiers in selecting treatment options for mania is discussed later in this section (see "Clinical features that help direct treatment choice").DSM-5 has eliminated the categorical "mixed episode" specifier, replacing it with the more dimensional "mixed features".

        <p>Agitation is common in mania, and is particularly frequent in patients who have mixed features. 122 Defined in DSM-5 as "excessive motor activity associated with a feeling of inner tension", 5 agitation can manifest as pacing or fidgeting in mild cases to uncooperative, threatening, or aggressive behaviours in severe cases. Severe symptoms of agitation require prompt attention in order to reduce distress, mitigate potentially dangerous behaviour, and allow for an assessment and evaluation of underlying manic symptoms. 123 A key step in treating agitation is preventing it, or at least mitigating its severity, by rapidly treating the causative manic episode. When addressing agitation in patients with BDI, clinicians need to be aware that akathisia may present as agitation and, therefore, this must be excluded before implementing the general principles of management of acute mania described in step 1 (see "Pharmacological treatment of manic episodes"). Since agitation in this context is a manifestation of mania, it is assumed that effective interventions for treating mania that have rapid onset of efficacy would be effective in reducing agitation. Therefore, if the patient is agreeable to taking oral medications, antimanic agents with rapid onset of efficacy should be considered first.Agitation is common in mania, and is particularly frequent in patients who have mixed features. 122 Defined in DSM-5 as "excessive motor activity associated with a feeling of inner tension", 5 agitation can manifest as pacing or fidgeting in mild cases to uncooperative, threatening, or aggressive behaviours in severe cases.

        <p>When agitation persists despite administration of antimanic treatments, additional rapidly acting pharmacotherapy may often be needed. The evidence for specific efficacy of various agents in shortterm treatment of agitation is summarized in Table 11. Some of these agents are either not available or rarely used in North America (eg, midazolam and promethazine). We further note that the dose ranges in Table 11 are based on the doses studied in the trials, and would probably be appropriate in most situations. However, a comprehensive evaluation of the agitated patient is necessary (ie, medical conditions, treatments, drugs, intoxication, etc.) to determine a safe and adequate dose.When agitation persists despite administration of antimanic treatments, additional rapidly acting pharmacotherapy may often be needed.

        <p>As can be seen from Table 11, the highest level of evidence available in short-term treatment of agitation for oral formulations of any agent is level 3, and level 2 for intramuscular (IM) or inhaled formulations. In this context, it is important to remember that the absence of evidence does not constitute lack of efficacy. Indeed, clinical experience suggests that agitation in many patients with acute mania responds well to the oral medications. Thus, a loading dose of divalproex, oral formulations of atypical antipsychotics, conventional antipsychotics such as haloperidol or loxapine, and/or benzodiazepines such as lorazepam may be appropriate. If a patient indicates willingness to take oral treatment but there is a suspicion that the patient might "cheek" the medication, then either orally dispersing tablets (ODT), those that rapidly melt, oral liquid, or oral inhalation forms should be considered.As can be seen from Table 11, the highest level of evidence available in short-term treatment of agitation for oral formulations of any agent is level 3, and level 2 for intramuscular (IM) or inhaled formulations.

We suggest that the treating clinician make a decision as to whether to treat a given patient with monotherapy or combination therapy. That decision is typically based on the rapidity of response needed (eg, combination treatments tend to work faster), whether the patient had a previous history of partial response to monotherapy, severity of mania, tolerability concerns with combination therapy, and willingness of the patient to take combination therapy. Once a decision is made whether to treat the patient with monotherapy or combination therapy, then hierarchy related to monotherapy or combination therapy could be followed.

While each of these strategies has strong support for their efficacy, as indicated above, safety and tolerability concerns relegate them to second-line options. Although widely used in clinical practice, the combination of lithium and divalproex is also recommended as a second-line choice, as evidence supporting its efficacy is limited to uncontrolled trials (level 3). [148][149][150][151] ECT is also recommended as a second-line option (level 3) 152 and, although the number of controlled trials is limited, there is evidence to suggest that up to 80% of patients will show marked clinical improvements. 153 Brief pulse therapy with two or three treatments per week has been used. Bifrontal electrode placement is preferred over bitemporal as it is associated with faster treatment response and fewer cognitive side effects.

Hence, olanzapine, which is highest in the hierarchy amongst second-line agents, should be first choice before moving down the list in Table 12.In patients who are inadequately responsive to first-line agents, second-line choices include monotherapy with olanzapine (level 1), carbamazepine (level 1), ziprasidone (level 1), and haloperidol (level 1) 143 or combination therapy with olanzapine plus lithium or divalproex (level 1). While each of these strategies has strong support for their efficacy, as indicated above, safety and tolerability concerns relegate them to second-line options. Although widely used in clinical practice, the combination of lithium and divalproex is also recommended as a second-line choice, as evidence supporting its efficacy is limited to uncontrolled trials (level 3). [148][149][150][151] ECT is also recommended as a second-line option (level 3) 152 and, although the number of controlled trials is limited, there is evidence to suggest that up to 80% of patients will show marked clinical improvements. 153 Brief pulse therapy with two or three treatments per week has been used.

        <p>Rapid cycling, or a course of illness that includes four or more mood episodes a year, affects up to one-third of patients with BDI. [215][216][217][218] Hypothyroidism, antidepressant use and substance abuse are often associated with rapid cycling; thus assessing thyroid function and discontinuation of antidepressants, stimulants, and other psychotropic agents that are contributors to cycling are imperative. Consideration should be given to gradually withdrawing substances in order to prevent withdrawal, but this needs to be balanced against the severity of mood cycling and the need for rapid mood stabilization. As there is no evidence for the superiority of any first-line treatment in addressing acute manic symptoms in patients with a rapid cycling course, 219 appropriate pharmacotherapy should be selected primarily based on effectiveness in the maintenance phase, if known (see Section 5). It is likely that combinations of mood-stabilizing drugs may be more often necessary than monotherapies when rapid cycling is present, 220 but triple mood stabilizer therapy has not demonstrated superiority to double mood stabilizer therapy in a single RCT, 221 although methodological weaknesses probably limited interpretability of the findings.Rapid cycling, or a course of illness that includes four or more mood episodes a year, affects up to one-third of patients with BDI.

        <p>Patients with depression occurring in the context of BD are frequently misdiagnosed as having MDD, since the presence of mania or hypomania (particularly mild or moderate episodes which do not require hospitalization) may be challenging to establish retrospectively. This is especially true in the absence of a comprehensive diagnostic interview or collateral information, as patients may often lack basic knowledge of what hypomania/mania is, and/or have limited insight into these symptoms; and thus may not disclose this information unless specifically asked. Alternatively, patients who will ultimately present with hypomanic or manic episodes may only have experienced episodes of depression. Thus, clinicians must be vigilant for a diagnosis of BD, and routinely ask for symptoms of a previous manic/hypomanic episode in every patient presenting with a major depressive episode. A diagnosis of MDD should be made only after excluding the possibility of BD.Patients with depression occurring in the context of BD are frequently misdiagnosed as having MDD, since the presence of mania or hypomania (particularly mild or moderate episodes which do not require hospitalization) may be challenging to establish retrospectively.

We recommend that the agents listed first in the hierarchy be tried first, in the order listed, unless there are patient-specific reasons for choosing an agent lower down in the order, such as previous history of response/ non-response or clinical features (see Clinical features which help direct treatment choices). For instance, if a patient presents with an acute bipolar depressive episode and is not taking any treatment and has not been treated for this episode, that patient should be commenced on quetiapine monotherapy if there is no previous history of non-response or tolerability concerns with quetiapine. However, if a patient had been taking lithium and either had a breakthrough acute bipolar depressive episode or did not respond to monotherapy with lithium, then lurasidone or lamotrigine or quetiapine add-on or switch to quetiapine monotherapy or lurasidone monotherapy might be more appropriate in that order, given that lurasidone and lamotrigine adjunctive therapies have demonstrated efficacy in lithium non-responders. Similarly, in non-responders to lithium monotherapy, adjunctive lamotrigine could be another option.

        <p>Lamotrigine monotherapy was not superior to placebo in four double blind placebo controlled trials of acute bipolar depression on the primary outcome (254). However, a meta-analysis conducted on the response rates from these studies as well as a BDII trial showed superiority of lamotrigine (248). Moreover, methodological issues with the trials likely led to the effect of lamotrigine being underesঞmated-including the relaঞvely low final dose (200 mg in most trials, which is lower that usually used in clinical pracঞce) (255) and short trial duraঞon (8 weeks in most trials) which, coupled with the slow ঞtraঞon of lamotrigine, resulted in parঞcipants being on the final dose for only a short period (around two weeks). Further, lamotrigine was superior to placebo on Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Raঞng Scale (MADRS) in one of the studies (249), and changes in symptoms on this scale have since been used to demonstrate the efficacy of other agents for acute bipolar depression. Finally, the addiঞon of lamotrigine to lithium (253) was superior to adding placebo to lithium and there was a trend for superiority of addiঞon of lamotrigine to queঞapine vs placebo add on (252) in treaঞng bipolar depression. It is likely that these beneficial effects are due to the direct effect of lamotrigine and not due to pharmacokineঞc interacঞon between lamotrigine and concomitant medicaঞons. Furthermore, trial design issues, especially the fact that the six-week dose ঞtraঞon phase took up most of the 8 week trials, is likely to compromise efficacy signals.

        <p>Across several different medications for bipolar depression, early improvement (after 2 weeks) has been found to be a reasonable predictor of overall response, whereas lack of early improvement is a more robust predictor of non-response. 255 Lamotrigine is the exception to this rule, given a necessary slow titration initiating the medication. In the case of non-response, dosing should be optimized and issues of non-adherence identified and addressed (see Section 2) prior to adjusting treatment strategies.Across several different medications for bipolar depression, early improvement (after 2 weeks) has been found to be a reasonable predictor of overall response, whereas lack of early improvement is a more robust predictor of non-response. 255 Lamotrigine is the exception to this rule, given a necessary slow titration initiating the medication.

        <p>When determining whether an agent should be switched or another first-line agent be added on to any current treatment, the effectiveness of each of the medications needs to be understood in the context of all the goals of managing BD. It is often the case that a medication may be selected to address several goals; for instance, lithium could be added for acute depression with intent to also bolster anti-manic prophylaxis. In this scenario, if lithium is ineffective in the individual patient for an acute bipolar depression but is also being used over the long term for anti-manic prophylaxis, then an "add-on" intervention should be the next treatment for the acute bipolar depression. If, for instance, the anti-manic prophylaxis is already being fully provided by an atypical antipsychotic, then the new medication could replace lithium via a switch strategy. Decisionmaking must also address efficacy for comorbid conditions, as well as tolerability concerns. In principle, all things being equal, a switch is preferred over add-on to limit the degree of polypharmacy, but the clinical reality is that medications may be helpful for some but not all components of the illness, and using rational polypharmacy via add-on treatments is often required. For situations in which patients experience a depressive episode while already receiving an adequately dosed antidepressant, strong consideration should be given to discontinuing or switching the class of antidepressant, unless clear benefits are apparent in reducing the severity or frequency of depressive episodes. Switch of medications should be done in an overlap and taper manner unless there is medical necessity for abrupt discontinuation. 257 All first-line options should be tried in adequate doses for an adequate duration of time before considering second-line options either as an add-on or switch strategy.When determining whether an agent should be switched or another first-line agent be added on to any current treatment, the effectiveness of each of the medications needs to be understood in the context of all the goals of managing BD.

In patients who fail to respond to multiple first-and second-line agents, thirdline choices include monotherapy with carbamazepine (level 2) 242 or olanzapine (level 1). 242 Agents that may be applied adjunctively include aripiprazole (level 4), 266,267 armodafinil (level 4) 268,269 (Figure 3), asenapine (level 4), 270 levothyroxine (level 3), 271,272 modafinil (level 2) 268 (Figure 3), and pramipexole (level 3). 273,274 rTMS targeted at the left or right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (level 3) 275 may also be used in addition to medication. Other classes of antidepressants such as serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [SNRIs] and monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs] could be used adjunctively but clinicians need to ensure adequate anti-manic prophylaxis in such situations, as SNRIs and MAOIs have a higher propensity than other antidepressants to induce manic switch and cause mood destabilization (level 2).

        <p>Almost all individuals with BD require maintenance treatment to prevent subsequent episodes, reduce residual symptoms, and restore functioning and quality of life. There is increasing evidence to suggest that, for a subgroup of patients, BD may be a neuroprogressive disease in which recurrences are associated with reductions in brain grey and white matter volumes, worsening cognitive impairment, a decrease in inter-episodic recovery and functioning, a higher rate and severity of relapse, and a reduced rate of treatment response to both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. 325 It is therefore important that comprehensive treatment be initiated even after a first episode. 63 Effective maintenance treatment, early in the course of illness, has been shown to reverse cognitive impairment and preserve brain plasticity, particularly in those who remain episode free, 326,327 and may therefore lead to improved prognosis and minimization of illness progression. 328 There are preliminary data suggesting that, after a first episode, lithium might be superior to quetiapine in both volumetric and cognitive outcomes. 329,330 With treatment, 19%-25% of patients will experience a recurrence every year, compared to 23%-40% of those on placebo. 331 Risk factors for recurrence include younger age of onset, 332 psychotic features, 212 rapid cycling, 331 more (and more frequent) previous episodes, 333 comorbid anxiety, 334 and comorbid SUDs. 335 Persistent subthreshold symptoms also increase risk for subsequent mood episodes, 334,336,337 and the presence of residual symptoms should therefore be an indicator of a need for further treatment optimization. Availability of psychosocial support and lower levels of stress are also protective against recurrence. 337,338Almost all individuals with BD require maintenance treatment to prevent subsequent episodes, reduce residual symptoms, and restore functioning and quality of life.

        <p>Many agents recommended for management of acute manic or depressive episodes have prophylactic efficacy. Generally, medications that have been found to be effective in the acute phase should be continued during the maintenance phase. However, there are exceptions to this: the efficacy of adjunctive antidepressant therapy has not been examined systematically in large double-blind placebo-controlled trials; hence, long-term antidepressant use is not recommended, especially in light of the concerns about potential risk of manic/hypomanic switch and mood instability. However, in the subgroups of patients who have responded to combination treatment and are stable, preliminary evidence suggests that withdrawal of antidepressants may contribute to destabilization. 366 Clinical trials have shown that many atypical antipsychotics are effective in preventing relapse of mood episodes; with many agents, this efficacy is related to prevention of manic episodes but not depressive episodes. However, many of these trials have been conducted in patients with an index manic episode and, given that the polarity of an index episode predicts the polarity of relapse, depressive relapse rates in placebo groups in such studies have been low-compromising the statistical power to test the efficacy of these agents in prevention of depressive relapses. Thus, the efficacy of many of these agents in preventing depressive relapses remains unknown.Many agents recommended for management of acute manic or depressive episodes have prophylactic efficacy.

[414][415][416] Responsiveness may also be a familial trait, with a study showing that patients who have a lithium-responsive relative have a 67% likelihood of also being lithium responsive, versus 35% of those without a responsive relative. 417 Among biological measures, lack of electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities, higher brain lithium concentration, increased N-acetyl aspartate and lower myo-inositol peaks on magnetic resonance spectroscopy, as well as several variants in candidate gene studies, may predict response, 418 but these studies require confirmation.Factors associated with overall good prognosis of BD include good treatment adherence, lack of early adversity, intermediate age at onset, good social support, and the absence of spontaneous rapid cycling 406,407 or features of a personality disorder. 408 In general, lithium is the gold standard for maintenance treatment, as it is effective in preventing both manic and depressive episodes (magnitude of prophylactic efficacy greater against mania vs depression) and appears to have a degree of anti-suicidal effects. 352,369,[409][410][411][412][413] Patients who respond well to lithium treatment usually have an episodic remitting pre-treatment clinical course, a family history of BD (especially BD responsive to lithium), low rates of comorbidity (especially anxiety and substance abuse disorders), and a pattern of mania-depression-euthymia in biphasic episodes, as well as a typical clinical presentation.

The DSM-5 criteria for hypomania are similar to those for mania, with symptoms being uncharacteristic of the individual, observable by others, and lasting at least 4 consecutive days. In contrast to mania, they cannot be severe enough to cause marked impairment or require hospitalization, and there must be an absence of psychosis.

        <p>The treatment of BDII has been understudied relative to BDI. This is probably due to the long-standing but discredited impression of BDII as a less severe form of BD. The number of RCTs in BDII is substantially smaller than that in BDI, and those studies that do exist are frequently under-powered. It also remains common for trials to enrol patients with both BDII and BDI without reporting results separately, making it difficult to determine if there are clinically meaningful differences in treatment response between the two illnesses. This is important because, while clinical experience and the results of many studies suggest that response to mood stabilizers and antipsychotics is similar in BDII and BDI, there are enough exceptions to suggest this should not be taken for granted. 248,405,431 This is also the case for antidepressants, which may have a more favourable risk-benefit ratio in BDII (reviewed below).

        <p>Lamotrigine monotherapy was studied in two trials in BDII depression: one in which 221 BDII paঞents received 200 mg/day or placebo for 8 weeks, and a second in which 206 BDI or BDII paঞents (N = 84 with BDII) received 100-400 mg/day for 10 weeks (254). Both produced negaঞve results. A meta-analysis confirmed that lamotrigine was not superior to placebo in BDII depression, although it did separate from placebo in BDI (248). Several methodological shortcomings likely resulted in the studies underesঞmaঞng the drug's effect, including 1) a slow ঞtraঞon which resulted in subjects being on the target dose for a short ঞme, 2) a target dose lower than that o[en used in clinical pracঞce and in successful maintenance studies (255, 324), and 3) higher placebo response rates. In contrast, a single-blind RCT with a relaঞvely high dose (final peak dose=300mg) and a longer duraঞon (16 weeks) found that lamotrigine monotherapy was as effecঞve as adequately-dosed lithium (mean final serum level=1.1 mEq/L) in N=98 BDII paঞents (445). Two large RCTs in BDI+BDII and a 12-week open-label trial in paঞents with BDI+BDII+BDNOS also reported that adjuncঞve lamotrigine was effecঞve, but did not report results separately for BDII (252, 253). Finally, lamotrigine has robust efficacy in prevenঞng depressive relapse in BDI and BDII (324, 459). Taking all of these factors into consideraঞon we recommend lamotrigine as a second-line treatment, parঞcularly for paঞents who can tolerate a slow ঞtraঞon and delayed effect. that even the placebo-controlled trials only met criteria for level 4 evidence (Table 1).Lamotrigine monotherapy was studied in two trials in BDII depression: one in which 221 BDII paঞents received 200 mg/day or placebo for 8 weeks, and a second in which 206 BDI or BDII paঞents (N = 84 with BDII) received 100-400 mg/day for 10 weeks (254).

        <p>These methodological limitations, coupled with the lack of clinical trial evidence for many medications, make it difficult to make specific suggestions for the treatment of hypomania. Clinical experience suggests that all anti-manic medications are also efficacious in hypomania. Thus, when hypomania is frequent, severe, or impairing enough to require treatment, clinicians should consider mood stabilizers such as lithium or divalproex and/or atypical antipsychotics. Nacetylcysteine may also be of benefit, but further studies are needed.These methodological limitations, coupled with the lack of clinical trial evidence for many medications, make it difficult to make specific suggestions for the treatment of hypomania.

Pooled analyses of five identically designed trials demonstrated that quetiapine was superior to placebo, and moreover was equally effective for acute depression in BDI and BDII. 243,437 The latter finding must be reconciled with the fact that quetiapine beat placebo in only three of the five individual trials in patients with BDII, compared to all five in patients with BDI. 253,290,[438][439][440] This is probably because the smaller sample of BDII patients-only about half as many patients with BDII as BDI were enrolled in each of the trials-provided less statistical power for BDII.

        <p>Quetiapine. In two 52-week maintenance studies, patients with BDII who achieved remission from depression with quetiapine monotherapy continued it or switched to placebo. 495 A pooled analysis reported that patients treated with quetiapine had a significantly longer time to relapse into any mood episode (hazard ratio [HR] 0.33, or a 67% reduction in the risk of relapse) and into depression (HR 0.28 or a 72% risk reduction). Time to relapse into hypomania was not significantly greater (HR 0.65 or a 35% risk reduction). The latter finding may be related to the low base rate of hypomania, which occurred in only 10% of all study participants. Quetiapine was at least as effective in BDII as in BDI, for which the risk reductions were 42% for any relapse, 48% for depression, and 30% for mania.Quetiapine.

        <p>Lithium. In three placebo-controlled RCTs conducted in the 1970s and 1980s (duration = 11-25 months), lithium decreased the frequency and/or severity of hypomanic and depressive episodes. 399,450,452 Serum lithium levels were 0.8-1.2 mEq/L. A number of active comparator studies also support lithium. As noted above, lithium was as effective as quetiapine in preventing relapse in a 6-month single-blind trial. 453 A 20-month study comparing lithium and divalproex in rapid cycling BDI + BDII found the two drugs to be equally effective in preventing relapses. 496 The authors noted that findings were similar for BDII and BDI, but results were otherwise not reported separately for BDII. In a 2.5year study in BDII + BD NOS, lithium and carbamazepine were equally effective on most outcomes, although a numerical advantage favoured carbamazepine for reducing clinical plus subclinical recurrence. 405 In contrast, head-to-head comparisons with antidepressants (reviewed below) found that lithium was not as effective in preventing depressive relapse as fluoxetine or venlafaxine. 469,497 This may be explained by the mean lithium levels, which were 0.7 mEq/L in both studies, while the fluoxetine trial was also enriched for fluoxetine responders.Lithium.

For nearly half of the patients, recurrence occurred in the first trimester, with the median time for recurrence for those abruptly discontinuing treatment being 2 weeks, compared to 22 weeks for those who were gradually tapered off. 511 However, studies from primary care, as well as obstetric centres, found low rates of relapse or hospitalizations in pregnancy. 526 The hierarchies presented throughout these guidelines should be followed for management of the various phases of BD, with consideration given to specific risks associated with the use of each medication using the most up-to-date information available from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (http://www.fda.Given the complexity of the risks faced by women with BD in pregnancy and puerperium, it is good clinical practice to encourage liaison between the mental health and obstetrics/gynecology teams.

        <p>The potential risks and benefits of taking medications while breastfeeding should be discussed with the patient. Education about early recognition of drug toxicity and requirement for ongoing monitoring of infants is also critical. 539 A recent systematic review suggested quetiapine and olanzapine as preferred choices for breastfeeding, considering their relatively lower infant dosages. 540 The impact of medication on the infant can be reduced by scheduling medication administration after breastfeeding. 541 Replacing or supplementing breast milk with formula can also be considered. Although there are many benefits to breastfeeding, associated sleep disruption may increase the risk of mood episodes in women with BD. If possible, bottle feeding at night by the woman's partner or a support can be beneficial to allow the woman to maintain a better sleeping schedule. In women with postpartum psychosis or mania, breastfeeding may be more risky, and therefore may not be indicated, as the mother may be too disorganized to safely breastfeed. 542 As childbirth can be a trigger for first onset of hypomania/mania in women with MDD, antidepressants should be used cautiously, especially in women with a family history of BD. 543 Women with first onset of depression in the postpartum period or those who have recurrence of depression during the early postpartum period, may also be at a high risk of switching to BD following treatment with antidepressants. 537The potential risks and benefits of taking medications while breastfeeding should be discussed with the patient.

        <p>Despite the paucity of large, well-designed research studies examining the impact of the menstrual cycle on mood symptoms in BD, accumulating evidence suggests that hormonal changes can impact the course of illness. Several case reports and prospective studies suggest that women who experience premenstrual symptom exacerbation are more likely to have a highly symptomatic and relapse prone illness. 544,545 One of the largest studies (n = 1099) found that women who met DSM-5 provisional criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) had an earlier illness onset, more comorbid Axis I disorders, a higher number of hypomanic/manic and depressive episodes, and higher rates of rapid cycling. 546 In this study, there was a closer gap between BD onset and age of menarche in women with comorbid PMDD, which suggests that sensitivity to endogenous hormones may influence the onset and the clinical course of BD. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and PMDD also occur more frequently in women with BD. 547,548 Importantly, an accurate diagnosis of comorbid PMDD in women with BD is made during euthymia, with a minimum of 2 months of prospective symptom charting. 549Despite the paucity of large, well-designed research studies examining the impact of the menstrual cycle on mood symptoms in BD, accumulating evidence suggests that hormonal changes can impact the course of illness.

        <p>As the following section comprises only a brief overview of the epidemiology, phenomenology, and differential diagnosis of BD in children and adolescents, the reader is referred to more detailed reviews for further information. [555][556][557][558][559][560] Between one-third (community samples) and two-thirds (clinical samples) of patients with BD experience their first mood episode during childhood or adolescence, with an earlier onset related to a more severe illness characterized by increased symptom burden and comorbidity. 561,562 In contrast to the controversies of as recently as a decade ago, there is now far greater consensus in the field that, although there are developmental differences in the manner in which symptoms manifest themselves, the actual diagnosis of BD in children and adolescents should be made based on the same set of symptoms as applied to adults. 563 When defined rigorously according to DSM-5 criteria, the course of illness in childhood and adolescence is characterized by eventual high rates of symptomatic recovery, but also high rates of recurrence, even in the context of naturalistic treatment. 564 While the concepts of "over-diagnosis" and "over-treatment" in pediatric BD have received substantial attention, 565 representative population studies demonstrate that adolescent BD is characterized by low rates of treatment, alongside high rates of suicidality and comorbidity. 566,567 Risks of incorrectly diagnosing and treating BD in a child or adolescent should thus be carefully weighed against the risk of incorrectly or not diagnosing or treating, 568 keeping in mind that the duration of treatment delay has been shown to be an independent risk factor for a poor outcome in adulthood. 569 Distinguishing early-onset mania or hypomania from other psychiatric disorders is important as there is a high level of symptomatic overlap for multiple conditions including but not limited to ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), substance abuse, personality disorders and generalized anxiety disorder 555,570 (Table 22). The discrete episodes of mania/ hypomania and the non-overlapping symptoms can facilitate accurate diagnosis. When a comorbidity is present, such as ADHD, overlapping symptoms (eg, distractibility and hyperactivity) should only count towards a diagnosis of mania or hypomania if they intensify during intervals of elation or irritability. Notably, ADHD is an ongoing condition whereas BD is episodic, and decreased sleep, hypersexuality, hallucinations or delusions, and homicidal or suicidal thoughts and actions occur with childhood mania, but are rare or absent in uncomplicated ADHD.As the following section comprises only a brief overview of the epidemiology, phenomenology, and differential diagnosis of BD in children and adolescents, the reader is referred to more detailed reviews for further information.

        <p>It is important to note that, while chronic irritability with episodic behavioural outbursts or rages can be seen in multiple paediatric psychiatric disorders (including emerging personality disorders, substance abuse, ODD, pervasive developmental disorders, and major depressive episodes), such irritability and explosiveness are not sufficient to make a diagnosis, even when severe. The recent DSM-5 diagnosis DMDD-which includes chronic irritability as a defining feature-lists BD as an exclusion criterion.It is important to note that, while chronic irritability with episodic behavioural outbursts or rages can be seen in multiple paediatric psychiatric disorders (including emerging personality disorders, substance abuse, ODD, pervasive developmental disorders, and major depressive episodes), such irritability and explosiveness are not sufficient to make a diagnosis, even when severe.

        <p>The general principles for managing adults with BD also apply to children and youth. In youth, themes of comorbidity and tolerability are accentuated. Comorbid ADHD is more common in children and adolescents as compared to adults with BD. Moreover, ADHD symptoms often do not improve following mood stabilization, and may require concurrent ADHD treatment. In addition, due to elevated risk for accelerated atherosclerosis and early cardiovascular disease in this population, cardiovascular risk factors should also be assessed regularly and intervention implemented. Lifestyle management including attention to diet, substance use, smoking and physical activity should be implemented alongside any psychological or pharmacological interventions. 582 Relatedly, children and adolescents are more susceptible than adults to the metabolic side effects of psychiatric medications, particularly the atypical antipsychotics that are considered first-line treatments. 583 Taken together, these distinguishing features underscore the importance of ensuring that polypharmacy, as often required, is judicious and informed by a balance of factors including mood symptom burden, global functioning, and physical health.The general principles for managing adults with BD also apply to children and youth.

        <p>Because of the aging population in Canada and many countries around the world, knowledge of pertinent issues related to the management of older adults is becoming increasingly important. Approximately 6% of geriatric psychiatry outpatients and 10% of inpatients have BD, 620 and proportionally this population is one of the highest users of psychiatric and physical health services. 621 Approximately 25% of the patients with BD in the USA in 2005 were over the age of 60 years, 622 and by 2030 &gt;50% of patients with BD are expected to be aged &gt;60 years. 623 The lifetime prevalence of late-life BD is about 1%-2% with a 1year prevalence of 0.1%-0.7% in the general population. About 90%-95% of older adults with bipolar disorder have their initial episode prior to age 50 years, although there is a minority who will have a later onset. 624,625 Late onset is often related to neurological or physical comorbidity, 626 and may carry a negative prognosis, 627 although this is not a consistent finding. 628 While symptoms of mania or hypomania are generally less prominent in older adults, depressive and cognitive symptoms are more often observed, and hyperactivity, aggression, insomnia, impulsivity, and self-neglect may pose a significant risk to the patient and others. 629,630 Psychiatric comorbidity is also generally lower than in younger patients, with anxiety and substance use being the most common. 631 Compared to younger patients, older adults are less likely to utilize inpatient, outpatient, and emergency room services and more likely to use case-management and conservator services. 632 Cognitive dysfunction is a significant concern for this population, with &gt;30% showing significant deficits across all mood states, including euthymia. 633 This cognitive dysfunction is relatively stable, related to the number of mood episodes earlier in life, and does not appear to exceed normal aging in 2-5-year follow-up.

        <p>The data supporting efficacy of medications in various mood states in this population are limited, with only a single RCT exclusively in geriatric patients completed to date, comparing lithium vs divalproex for the treatment of mania/hypomania. 644 Despite this, open-label trials, naturalistic studies, and post hoc analyses of mixed aged RCTs suggest that medications efficacious in adults overall will also be effective in older adults, although additional considerations regarding medication tolerability and age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics must be taken into account. Because of the high number of medical comorbidities as well as physical changes related to the aging process, strict attention must be paid in these patients to potential pharmacokinetic issues, drug-drug interactions, side effects, and the need for ongoing monitoring (see Section 8).The data supporting efficacy of medications in various mood states in this population are limited, with only a single RCT exclusively in geriatric patients completed to date, comparing lithium vs divalproex for the treatment of mania/hypomania. 644 Despite this, open-label trials, naturalistic studies, and post hoc analyses of mixed aged RCTs suggest that medications efficacious in adults overall will also be effective in older adults, although additional considerations regarding medication tolerability and age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics must be taken into account.

        <p>Amongst other effects, lithium has been associated with adverse neurological effects 645 and renal disease. 646 Divalproex has been associated with motor side effects 645 and metabolic effects (weight gain and diabetes mellitus). 647 Carbamazepine induces cytochrome P450 enzymes and can reduce the levels of divalproex and other medications. 648 Regarding antipsychotics, which are now very commonly used for BD in older adults, dose reduction may be beneficial in some aging patients to lower the risk of motor, sedation, metabolic syndrome, and cognitive effects. 649 There is an association between mortality and antipsychotics in patients with dementia 650 but it is unclear how this should be managed for patients with BD. Recently there have also been data linking antipsychotics with acute kidney injury. 651 In particular, when lithium is used in this population, lithium level and renal monitoring should occur at least every 3-6 months, as well as 5-7 days following a lithium dose adjustment or adjustment of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antiontensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), or thiazide diuretic dosing. 652 Special consideration also needs to be given to dose selection. A post hoc analysis of the STEP-BD study found that while, on average, older patients required a similar number of medications to younger patients to achieve recovery, lower doses were used. In that sample, over twice as many older patients as younger ones recovered using lithium alone (42% vs 21%, respectively). 653 In general, starting at a lower dose (eg, 150 mg nightly for lithium) is recommended, with gradual adjustments to reach the lowest end of the therapeutic range for adults, with subsequent titration based on tolerability and effectiveness; keeping in mind that some older patients will require similar blood levels as the general adult population in order to achieve remission. Further discussion, including clinical guidance and more detailed treatment recommendations, can be found in the ISBD Task Force report. 654 In light of very limited international guidelines for maintenance treatment of older adults with BD, an ISBD Task Force is currently undertaking a Delphi survey of international experts, and clinicians are advised to consult this as results become available in the future (Shulman K, personal communication).Amongst other effects, lithium has been associated with adverse neurological effects 645 and renal disease. 646 Divalproex has been associated with motor side effects 645 and metabolic effects (weight gain and diabetes mellitus). 647 Carbamazepine induces cytochrome P450 enzymes and can reduce the levels of divalproex and other medications. 648 Regarding antipsychotics, which are now very commonly used for BD in older adults, dose reduction may be beneficial in some aging patients to lower the risk of motor, sedation, metabolic syndrome, and cognitive effects. 649 There is an association between mortality and antipsychotics in patients with dementia 650 but it is unclear how this should be managed for patients with BD.

        <p>Two recent reviews indicated that the prevalence rate of comorbid SUD in BD is about 33% in general population surveys 674 and approximately 45% in clinical settings. 675 SUD can negatively impact the course of BD, resulting in lower rates of remission, 407 a higher number of hospitalizations, 676,677 and an increased risk of suicide attempts 429 and perhaps suicide deaths. 678 Substance use should be addressed as early as possible, as it is likely to interfere with treatment for BD. However, the presence of a SUD should not preclude an attempt to treat BD, which might result in an individual being more amenable to treatment. As the directionality of the interaction between SUD and BD is rarely clear in the reality of clinical practice, it is recommended that the two conditions be treated simultaneously.Two recent reviews indicated that the prevalence rate of comorbid SUD in BD is about 33% in general population surveys 674 and approximately 45% in clinical settings. 675 SUD can negatively impact the course of BD, resulting in lower rates of remission, 407 a higher number of hospitalizations, 676,677 and an increased risk of suicide attempts 429 and perhaps suicide deaths. 678 Substance use should be addressed as early as possible, as it is likely to interfere with treatment for BD.

        <p>The levels of evidence for treatment of comorbid SUD are low. This is because of (i) the paucity of data, (ii) complexity of study designs (given the fact that many patients will be using more than one substance), and, most importantly (iii) inconsistency of the outcome variables used in these studies; hindering direct comparison of results.The levels of evidence for treatment of comorbid SUD are low.

        <p>A combination of divalproex and lithium is the only treatment for alcohol use disorder comorbid with BD that meets criteria for level 2 evidence. 682,683 In a small RCT, there was a significant reduction in the number of drinks per drinking day, as well as per heavy drinking day, in the combination group compared to the group with lithium alone when adherence to treatment was added as a covariate. There is only level 3 evidence for lamotrigine, 684 and divalproex monotherapy or add-on.

        <p>A "step-wise" approach was recommended in the 2012 CANMAT recommendations for managing comorbid anxiety. In general, mood stabilization is the priority before specific anxiety treatments are considered (Figure 9). Despite clinical experience, antidepressants, particularly serotoninergic agents, should be employed with caution due to their potential to provoke mood destabilization. While benzodiazepines are an important clinical tool because they can rapidly alleviate anxiety, clinicians should strive to prescribe them at the lowest possible dose for the shortest period possible, given the concerns about suicide risk, abuse and dependence. CBT continues to be an appropriate first-line treatment for anxiety.A "step-wise" approach was recommended in the 2012 CANMAT recommendations for managing comorbid anxiety.

Mixed amphetamine salts (level 3), 611 methylphenidate (level 3), 612 atomoxetine (level 4), 615 bupropion (level 4), 766 or lisdexamfetamine (level 4) 767 add-ons to mood-stabilizing treatments have been reported to be efficacious in improving ADHD symptoms.</p>
        <p>In a s Swedish national patient registry study of patients with BD and ADHD, methylphenidate monotherapy significantly increased the risk of mania, while those patients treated concurrently with a mood stabilizer experienced a significantly reduced risk of mania when methylphenidate was employed. 289In a s Swedish national patient registry study of patients with BD and ADHD, methylphenidate monotherapy significantly increased the risk of mania, while those patients treated concurrently with a mood stabilizer experienced a significantly reduced risk of mania when methylphenidate was employed. 289</p>
        <p>While there is consistent evidence showing the high prevalence of comorbid medical conditions in BD [768][769][770][771][772][773][774] and the negative impact these diagnoses have on longevity, 775,776 these conditions frequently go undiagnosed or undertreated. In a large UK cross-sectional analysis of electronic data sets involving 1.7 million patients in primary care, those diagnosed with BD, when compared with healthy controls, had lower rates of diagnoses (odds ratio [OR] 0.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54-0.63) and treatment of medical conditions, despite higher rates of one (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.16-1.39) or multiple illnesses (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.3-1.64). 769 Metabolic syndrome in particular is a highly prevalent comorbidity, present in 20-65% of patients with BD. 777 Defined as a cluster of clinical and biochemical features, including abdominal adiposity, hypertension, impaired fasting glucose, diabetes mellitus, and atherogenic dyslipidaemia, 778 metabolic syndrome not only greatly increases an individual's risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and premature mortality 779 but also worsens bipolar clinical outcomes. 780,781 Increased body mass index (BMI) is an important contributor to metabolic syndrome, although metabolic dysfunction is not always accompanied by overweight/obesity, and so patients with normal BMI should also receive regular monitoring (Section 8).While there is consistent evidence showing the high prevalence of comorbid medical conditions in BD [768][769][770][771][772][773][774] and the negative impact these diagnoses have on longevity, 775,776 these conditions frequently go undiagnosed or undertreated.

        <p>It has been hypothesized that BD and metabolic syndrome share a set of common risk factors and overlapping pathophysiology. [782][783][784] While medications used to treat BD, particularly atypical antipsychotics, can also lead to metabolic dysfunction and weight problems (Section 8), insufficient access to primary and preventative health care, low socioeconomic status, habitual inactivity, insulin dysfunction, peripheral inflammation and neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and childhood adversity are also important contributors. 785It has been hypothesized that BD and metabolic syndrome share a set of common risk factors and overlapping pathophysiology.

        <p>As noted in previously in these guidelines, older adults commonly have three or more medical comorbidities that contribute to the 10-15 year lower life expectancy compared to non-psychiatric populations. 642 The most common medical comorbidities are metabolic syndrome, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, and endocrine disorders. 631,641 This highlights the necessity for vigilance when treating all patients with BD, including regular assessments of their metabolic parameters. 785 for further detailed discussion on foundational principles for managing metabolic conditions in patients with BD.As noted in previously in these guidelines, older adults commonly have three or more medical comorbidities that contribute to the 10-15 year lower life expectancy compared to non-psychiatric populations. 642 The most common medical comorbidities are metabolic syndrome, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, and endocrine disorders. 631,641 This highlights the necessity for vigilance when treating all patients with BD, including regular assessments of their metabolic parameters. 785 for further detailed discussion on foundational principles for managing metabolic conditions in patients with BD.</p>
        <p>While there is no evidence specifically regarding treatment of comorbid dyslipidaemia or hypertension in BD, it is noteworthy that many of the medications used to manage these comorbid medical disorders have epidemiological or even clinical trial evidence that they may benefit mood. Examples include statins, aspirin and angiotensin antagonists. [788][789][790][791][792][793] The implications are that clinicians should be actively engaged in the management of these disorders, and should select therapies from those agents that may have benefit in mood symptoms. This again is concordant with the notion of shared risk pathways for these non-communicable disorders. The first study reported hazard ratio for stroke over 11 years of 0.39 (95% CI 0.22-0.68) for those prescribed lithium, even when adjusting for the risks associated with typical and atypical antipsychotics. The reduced risk was also correlated with a higher dose, longer treatment duration and a higher rate of exposure to lithium. 794 In the second study, in a sample of 4729 patients diagnosed with BD, lithium exposure was associated with a reduced risk of cancer, compared to a group prescribed anticonvulsant medications. (Lithium with or without anticonvulsant HR = 0.735, 95% CI 0.55-0.97). The study also demonstrated a dose-response relationship. 795 In a subsequent large BD cohort study (n = 9651) focusing on genitourinary cancer, however, lithium was not associated with any change in risk. 796 A recent meta-analysis suggests increased risk of dementia in BD. 797 There is some evidence that lithium in drinking water reduces the risk of dementia in the general population 638 as does the use of lithium in patients with BD. 798While there is no evidence specifically regarding treatment of comorbid dyslipidaemia or hypertension in BD, it is noteworthy that many of the medications used to manage these comorbid medical disorders have epidemiological or even clinical trial evidence that they may benefit mood.

        <p>As described in Section 6, despite normal weight at illness onset, 806 it is common for patients with BD to become overweight or obese, and several medications used to treat the illness may also exacerbate this effect. The likelihood of medications to cause weight gain should be carefully considered, as this is one of the most frequent treatment-related factors of non-adherence; contributing to upwards of 60% of cases. 807 The medications most commonly associated with weight gain are olanzapine, clozapine, risperidone, quetiapine, gabapentin, divalproex and lithium; with carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and ziprasidone being the safer or options associated with less weight gain. 808 Recent reviews further suggest that asenapine and aripiprazole (longer term use) 809 also may lead to weight gain, but the impact of lurasidone on weight is minimal. 810 All patients should be regularly monitored for weight changes.As described in Section 6, despite normal weight at illness onset, 806 it is common for patients with BD to become overweight or obese, and several medications used to treat the illness may also exacerbate this effect.

        <p>Lithium has a well-recognized potential for renal toxicity, including nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy, and acute tubular necrosis, with NDI reported in 20%-40% of patients. [814][815][816] Upwards of 70% of patients on chronic lithium treatment will experience polyuria, which can cause impairment in work and daily functioning. This side effect is commonly underreported, unless it is directly inquired about. 817 Long-term administration (ie, 10-20+ years) is further associated with decreased glomerular filtration rate and chronic kidney disease. 818 While long-term lithium administration is probably an important risk factor for developing chronic kidney disease, factors that may increase susceptibility include higher plasma lithium levels, multiple daily lithium doses (vs once daily), concurrent medications (eg NSAIDs, ARBs, ACEIs and diuretics), somatic illnesses (eg, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease) and older age. 819,820 Instances of lithium toxicity will also greatly increase risk of renal dysfunction. 821 Lithium use is associated with a two-fold higher risk of chronic kidney disease in older adults (&gt;66 years). 822 While the overall risk for progressive renal failure is low, plasma creatinine concentrations and ideally estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for these patients should be measured at least every 3-6 months. 652 Since 37% of patients aged &gt;70 years have an eGFR &lt;60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 , 823 a strict eGFR cut-off for lithium discontinuation is difficult. The UK National Institute for Healthcare and Excellence (NICE) guidelines for chronic kidney disease (CKD) recommend nephrologist consultation if there is rapidly declining eGFR (&gt;5 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 in 1 year, or &gt;10 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 within 5 years), if the eGFR falls below 45 in two consecutive readings, or if the clinician is concerned. 646,824 Because of its narrow therapeutic window, acute lithium intoxication is also a complication, which, though reversible, can lead to reductions in glomerular filtration rate. 825,826 Drugs that alter renal function and general medical conditions characterized by decreased circulating volume all contribute to increased risk. 827Lithium has a well-recognized potential for renal toxicity, including nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy, and acute tubular necrosis, with NDI reported in 20%-40% of patients.

        <p>While many patients experience cognitive impairment, these deficits may be attributable to the disease itself, with more pronounced effects in those with more severe or chronic illness. 845 While a small study has led to suggestions that medicated patients who are euthymic do perform similarly to those not receiving treatment, 846 other naturalistic trials point towards the potential negative impact of several medications, with the effects of antipsychotics being the most significant. 845 Lithium can also lead to impairment in processing speed and memory, which patients may find distressing, 847 although recent randomized controlled data suggest lithium is superior to quetiapine in this regard. 329 Indeed, the effects of lithium on neurocognition are complex and further research is needed to fully elucidate its neurocognitive impact. 848 Anticonvulsants, except for lamotrigine, are also linked to subjective cognitive impairment. 847 Given the importance of cognition on a patient's function and quality of life, further studies are needed in this area.While many patients experience cognitive impairment, these deficits may be attributable to the disease itself, with more pronounced effects in those with more severe or chronic illness. 845 While a small study has led to suggestions that medicated patients who are euthymic do perform similarly to those not receiving treatment, 846 other naturalistic trials point towards the potential negative impact of several medications, with the effects of antipsychotics being the most significant. 845 Lithium can also lead to impairment in processing speed and memory, which patients may find distressing, 847 although recent randomized controlled data suggest lithium is superior to quetiapine in this regard. 329 Indeed, the effects of lithium on neurocognition are complex and further research is needed to fully elucidate its neurocognitive impact. 848 Anticonvulsants, except for lamotrigine, are also linked to subjective cognitive impairment. 847 Given the importance of cognition on a patient's function and quality of life, further studies are needed in this area.</p>
        <p>Sedation is a concern for many, and is reported by over half of patients as a reason for treatment non-adherence. 807 Divalproex and atypical antipsychotics are most likely to lead to these effects, with 30%-50% of patients on atypical antipsychotics experiencing sedation, compared to 8%-13% with placebo 164,214,[849][850][851] and 21%-29% of patients on divalproex. 852,853 This is not a concern with all antipsychotics, however; quetiapine, clozapine, and olanzapine will generally have higher rates of sedation compared to ziprasidone, risperidone, and aripiprazole. 810 Lamotrigine and lithium have both been found to be less likely to cause sedation than divalproex. 854,855Sedation is a concern for many, and is reported by over half of patients as a reason for treatment non-adherence. 807 Divalproex and atypical antipsychotics are most likely to lead to these effects, with 30%-50% of patients on atypical antipsychotics experiencing sedation, compared to 8%-13% with placebo 164,214,[849][850][851] and 21%-29% of patients on divalproex. 852,853 This is not a concern with all antipsychotics, however; quetiapine, clozapine, and olanzapine will generally have higher rates of sedation compared to ziprasidone, risperidone, and aripiprazole. 810 Lamotrigine and lithium have both been found to be less likely to cause sedation than divalproex. 854,855</p>
        <p>Tremor can be a significant cause of frustration for many patients, and is experienced by up to 10% of those treated with lithium or divalproex. 668,856,857 New onset neurological symptoms in patients on divalproex should raise suspicion of hyperammonaemic encephalopathy, which, while rare, can be potentially fatal, and hence early detection and discontinuation of divalproex is critical to prevent morbidity and mortality 858 Sustained release formulations and dose reductions may limit symptoms. 802,859,860 While conventional antipsychotics such as haloperidol are often associated with EPS (including pseudoparkinsonism, akathisia, acute dystonia, and tardive dyskinesia), 861 this risk is either absent or low with atypical antipsychotic agents. 862,863 Among the atypical agents, risperidone, aripiprazole, cariprazine, ziprasidone and lurasidone are more likely to cause EPS, particularly at higher doses. 810 In older patients, impaired swallowing function and dysphagia have also been linked to atypical agents, particularly at higher doses. 864,865 Although rare, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a potentially life-threatening adverse event associated with antipsychotic agents. The risk with atypical agents was considered negligible initially; however, while the risk is very low, several atypical agents have nevertheless been associated with NMS. 866 While generally unpredictable, the risk is greatest during the initial phase of treatment or change of dosage, with intravenous or intramuscular administration, with high dosages or polypharmacy, when the patient is physically restrained or dehydrated, in high ambient temperatures, in older patients and in patients with medical or psychiatric comorbidities.Tremor can be a significant cause of frustration for many patients, and is experienced by up to 10% of those treated with lithium or divalproex. 668,856,857 New onset neurological symptoms in patients on divalproex should raise suspicion of hyperammonaemic encephalopathy, which, while rare, can be potentially fatal, and hence early detection and discontinuation of divalproex is critical to prevent morbidity and mortality 858 Sustained release formulations and dose reductions may limit symptoms. 802,859,860 While conventional antipsychotics such as haloperidol are often associated with EPS (including pseudoparkinsonism, akathisia, acute dystonia, and tardive dyskinesia), 861 this risk is either absent or low with atypical antipsychotic agents. 862,863 Among the atypical agents, risperidone, aripiprazole, cariprazine, ziprasidone and lurasidone are more likely to cause EPS, particularly at higher doses. 810 In older patients, impaired swallowing function and dysphagia have also been linked to atypical agents, particularly at higher doses. 864,865 Although rare, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a potentially life-threatening adverse event associated with antipsychotic agents.

        <p>Patients with a previous history of NMS and/or a personal or family history of catatonia are also at higher risk. 867 Antipsychotics may also impact thermoregulation, with case studies indicating the potential for both heat-related illnesses 868 and hypothermia 869 ; thus, patients should be made aware and monitored for these risks during periods of extreme temperatures.Patients with a previous history of NMS and/or a personal or family history of catatonia are also at higher risk. 867 Antipsychotics may also impact thermoregulation, with case studies indicating the potential for both heat-related illnesses 868 and hypothermia 869 ; thus, patients should be made aware and monitored for these risks during periods of extreme temperatures.</p>
        <p>Approximately 10% of patients being treated with lamotrigine will experience a non-serious rash, with 0.3%-1% developing a serious rash such as toxic epidermal necrolysis and SJS, 870 although for those initiated on a dose of 25 mg with a gradual titration increasing the dose by 25 mg biweekly, the risk of developing serious rash may be as low as 0.02% or 1 in 5000. 871 In some cases, an even lower rate of titration may be used (ie 12.5 mg/day and then gradually increase as per instructions.Approximately 10% of patients being treated with lamotrigine will experience a non-serious rash, with 0.3%-1% developing a serious rash such as toxic epidermal necrolysis and SJS, 870 although for those initiated on a dose of 25 mg with a gradual titration increasing the dose by 25 mg biweekly, the risk of developing serious rash may be as low as 0.02% or 1 in 5000. 871 In some cases, an even lower rate of titration may be used (ie 12.5 mg/day and then gradually increase as per instructions.</p>
        <p>Carbamazepine is also associated with increased risk of rash and SJS, especially in the first 8 weeks of therapy, 872 although the baseline risk is extremely low. Similarly, while these can also occur with divalproex, the risk is extremely low. Nevertheless, it is important that patients be informed of these risks and told to report any rash immediately, and these treatments should be discontinued if a serious rash is suspected.Carbamazepine is also associated with increased risk of rash and SJS, especially in the first 8 weeks of therapy, 872 although the baseline risk is extremely low.

        <p>Lithium is also linked with a variety of potentially distressing skin conditions, including acne, psoriasis, eczema, hair loss, hidradenitis suppurativa, nail dystrophy and mucosal lesions, with overall estimates ranging from 3% to 45% depending on the criteria applied. Most cases can be managed without treatment discontinuation. As described in Section 6, patients with BD are already at elevated risk for these physical illnesses and this risk is further exacerbated by some atypical antipsychotic agents and mood stabilizers. Clozapine and olanzapine are associated with the greatest level of risk, followed by quetiapine (particularly in higher doses) and risperidone, with a more minimal impact of aripiprazole, ziprasidone, asenapine, and lurasidone. 810 Lithium and divalproex are also associated with weight gain. 791 All patients on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for changes in blood glucose and lipid profiles as indicated previously in this section, and if disturbances are detected, the atypical antipsychotic should be discontinued if possible and appropriate treatment initiated if necessary.Lithium is also linked with a variety of potentially distressing skin conditions, including acne, psoriasis, eczema, hair loss, hidradenitis suppurativa, nail dystrophy and mucosal lesions, with overall estimates ranging from 3% to 45% depending on the criteria applied.

        <p>Some anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and antipsychotics may decrease bone mineral density and increase the risk of fracture in highrisk patients. 874,875 This risk is increased by the presence of mood disorders, as well as known risks for mood disorders such as physical inactivity, smoking and poor diet quality. 876 Thus, screening for this population may be indicated. 877Some anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and antipsychotics may decrease bone mineral density and increase the risk of fracture in highrisk patients. 874,875 This risk is increased by the presence of mood disorders, as well as known risks for mood disorders such as physical inactivity, smoking and poor diet quality. 876 Thus, screening for this population may be indicated. 877</p>
        <p>The diagnosis and management of BD is complex, and effective, evidence-based care requires knowledge of current research as well as lessons gained from years of clinical experience. Members of the CANMAT guidelines committee hope this document does an effective job at providing an easy to understand narrative of both, thus aiding both specialists and primary care providers in delivering evidence-based care to their patients. As with previous editions of these guidelines, CANMAT will strive to provide regular updates capturing emerging trends and evaluating new evidence; and readers are encouraged to consult those as they become available to stay up to date in the field.The diagnosis and management of BD is complex, and effective, evidence-based care requires knowledge of current research as well as lessons gained from years of clinical experience.
