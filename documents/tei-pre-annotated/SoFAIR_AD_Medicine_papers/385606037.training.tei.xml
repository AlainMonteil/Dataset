        <p>The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (covid- 19) presents an important and urgent threat to global health. Since the outbreak in early December 2019 in the Hubei province of the People's Republic of China, the number of patients confirmed to have the disease has exceeded 47 million as the disease spread globally, and the number of people infected is probably much higher. More than 1.2 million people have died from covid-19 (up to 3 November 2020). 1 Despite public health responses aimed at containing the disease and delaying the spread, several countries have been confronted with a critical care crisis, and more countries could follow. [2][3][4] Outbreaks lead to important increases in the demand for hospital beds and shortage of medical equipment, while medical staff themselves can also become infected. Several regions have had or are experiencing second waves, and despite improvements in testing and tracing, several regions are again facing the limits of their test capacity, hospital resources and healthcare staff. 5 6 To mitigate the burden on the healthcare system, while also providing the best possible care for patients, efficient diagnosis and information on the prognosis of the disease are needed. Prediction models that combine several variables or features to estimate the risk of people being infected or experiencing a poor outcome from the infection could assist medical staff in triaging patients when allocating limited healthcare resources. Models ranging from rule based scoring systems to advanced machine learning models (deep learning) have been proposed and published in response to a call to share relevant covid-19 research findings rapidly and openly to inform the public health response and help save lives. 7 We aimed to systematically review and critically appraise all currently available prediction models for covid-19, in particular models to predict the risk of covid-19 infection or being admitted to hospital with the disease, models to predict the presence of covid-19 in patients with suspected infection, and models to predict the prognosis or course of infection in patients with covid-19. We included model development and external validation studies. This living systematic review, with periodic updates, is being conducted by the international COVID-PRECISE (Precise Risk Estimation to optimise covid-19 Care for Infected or Suspected patients in diverse sEttings; https://www. covprecise.org/) group in collaboration with the Cochrane Prognosis Methods Group.The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (covid- 19) presents an important and urgent threat to global health.

        <p>We searched the publicly available, continuously updated publication list of the covid-19 living systematic review. 8 We validated whether the list is fit for purpose (online supplementary material) and further supplemented it with studies on covid-19 retrieved from arXiv. The online supplementary material presents the search strings. We included studies if they developed or validated a multivariable model or scoring system, based on individual participant level data, to predict any covid-19 related outcome. These models included three types of prediction models: diagnostic models to predict the presence or severity of covid-19 in patients with suspected infection; prognostic models to predict the course of infection in patients with covid-19; and prediction models to identify people in the general population at risk of covid-19 infection or at risk of being admitted to hospital with the disease.We searched the publicly available, continuously updated publication list of the covid-19 living systematic review. 8 We validated whether the list is fit for purpose (online supplementary material) and further supplemented it with studies on covid-19 retrieved from arXiv.

        <p>We searched the database repeatedly up to 1 July 2020 (supplementary table 1). As of the third update (search date 1 July), we only include peer reviewed articles (indexed in PubMed and Embase through Ovid). Preprints (from bioRxiv, medRxiv, and arXiv) that were already included in previous updates of the systematic review remain included in the analysis. Reassessment takes place after publication of a preprint in a peer reviewed journal.

        <p>Data extraction of included articles was done by two independent reviewers (from LW, BVC, GSC, TPAD, MCH, GH, KGMM, RDR, ES, LJMS, EWS, KIES, CW, AL, JM, TT, JAAD, KL, JBR, LH, CS, MS, MCH, NS, NK, SMJvK, JCS, PD, CLAN, RW, GPM, IT, JYV, DLD, JW, FSvR, PH, VMTdJ, BCTvB, ICCvdH, DJM, MK, and MvS). Reviewers used a standardised data extraction form based on the CHARMS (critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies) checklist 10 and PROBAST (predic tion model risk of bias assessment tool; www.probast.org) for assessing the reported prediction models. 11 We sought to extract each model's predictive per formance by using whatever measures were presen ted. These measures included any summaries of discrimination (the extent to which predicted risks discriminate between participants with and without the outcome), and calibration (the extent to which predicted risks correspond to observed risks) as recommended in the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis; www.tripod-statement.org) statement. 12 Discrimination is often quantified by the C index (C index=1 if the model discriminates perfectly; C index=0.5 if discrimination is no better than chance). Calibration is often quantified by the calibration intercept (which is zero when the risks are not systematically overestimated or underestimated) and calibration slope (which is one if the predicted risks are not too extreme or too moderate). 13 We focused on performance statistics as estimated from the strongest available form of validation (in order of strength: external (evaluation in an independent database), internal (bootstrap validation, cross validation, random training test splits, temporal splits), apparent (evaluation by using exactly the same data used for development)). Any discrepancies in data extraction were discussed between reviewers, and remaining conflicts were resolved by LW or MvS. The online supplementary material provides details on data extraction. Some studies investigated multiple models and some models were investigated in multiple studies (that is, in external validation studies).

        <p>Among the diagnostic model studies, the reported prevalence of covid-19 varied between 7% and 71% (if a cross sectional or cohort design was used). Because 75 diagnostic studies used either case-control sampling or an unclear method of data collection, the Among the studies that developed prognostic models to predict mortality risk in people with confirmed or suspected infection, the percentage of deaths ranged from 1% to 52%. This wide variation is partly because of substantial sampling bias caused by studies excluding participants who still had the disease at the end of the study period (that is, they had neither recovered nor died). Additionally, length of follow-up varied between studies (but was often not reported), and there is likely to be local and temporal variation in how people were diagnosed as having covid-19 or were admitted to the hospital (and therefore recruited for the studies).Among the diagnostic model studies, the reported prevalence of covid-19 varied between 7% and 71% (if a cross sectional or cohort design was used).

        <p>We identified seven models that predicted risk of covid-19 in the general population. Three models from one study used hospital admission for nontuberculosis pneumonia, influenza, acute bronchitis, or upper respiratory tract infections as proxy outcomes in a dataset without any patients with covid-19. 16 Among the predictors were age, sex, previous hospital admission, comorbidities, and social determinants of health. The study reported C indices of 0. Two hundred and eight unique models were developed in the included studies. Thirty (14%) of these models were presented as a model equation including intercept and regression coefficients. Eight (4%) models were only partially presented (eg, intercept or baseline hazard were missing).

Predictors of severe covid-19 used more than once were comorbidities, liver enzymes, C reactive protein, imaging features, lymphocyte count, and neutrophil count.All these presentation formats make predictions readily available for use in the clinic.

        <p>Of these models, 39 estimated mortality risk and 28 aimed to predict progression to a severe or critical disease. The remaining studies used other outcomes (single or as part of a composite) including recovery, length of hospital stay, intensive care unit admission, intubation, (duration of) mechanical ventilation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac injury and thrombotic complication. One study used data from 2015 to 2019 to predict mortality and prolonged assisted mechanical ventilation (as a non-covid-19 proxy outcome). 115 The most frequently used categories of prognostic factors (for any outcome, included at least 20 times) included age, comorbidities, vital signs, image features, sex, lymphocyte count, and C reactive protein. Studies that predicted mortality reported C indices between 0.68 and 0.98. Four studies also presented calibration plots (including at external validation for three models), all indicating miscalibration 15 69 118 or showing plots for integer scores without clearly explaining how these were translated into predicted risks. 143 The studies that developed models to predict progression to a severe or critical disease reported C indices between 0.58 and 0.99.

        <p>All models were at high (n=226, 97%) or unclear (n=6, 3%) risk of bias according to assessment with PROBAST, which suggests that their predictive performance when used in practice is probably lower than that reported (fig 2).

        <p>Ninety eight models (42%) had a high risk of bias for the participants domain, which indicates that the participants enrolled in the studies might not be representative of the models' targeted populations. Unclear reporting on the inclusion of participants led to an unclear risk of bias assessment in 58 models (25%), and 76 (33%) had a low risk of bias for the participants domain. Fifteen models (6%) had a high risk of bias for the predictor domain, which indicates that predictors were not available at the models' intended time of use, not clearly defined, or influenced by the outcome measurement. One hundred and thirty five (58%) models were rated unclear and 82 (35%) rated at low risk of bias for the predictor domain. Most studies used outcomes that are easy to assess (eg, death, presence of covid-19 by laboratory confirmation), and hence 95 (41%) were rated at low risk of bias. Nonetheless, there was cause for concern about bias induced by the outcome measurement in 50 models (22%), for example, due to the use of subjective or proxy outcomes (eg, non-covid-19 severe respiratory infections). Eighty seven models (38%) had an unclear risk of bias due to opaque or ambiguous reporting. Two hundred and eighteen (94%) models were at high risk of bias for the analysis domain. The reporting was insufficiently clear to assess risk of bias in the analysis in 13 studies (6%). Only one model had a low risk of bias for the analysis domain (&lt;1%). Twenty nine (13%) models had low risk of bias on all domains except analysis, indicating adequate data collection and study design, but issues that could have been avoided by conducting a better statistical analysis. Many studies had small to modest sample sizes (table 1), which led to an increased risk of overfitting, particularly if complex modelling strategies were used. In addition, 50 models (22%) were neither internally nor externally validated. Performance statistics calculated on the development data from these models are likely optimistic. Calibration was only assessed for 22 models using calibration plots (10%), of which 11 on external validation data. We found two models that were generally of good quality, built on large datasets, and had been rated low risk of bias on most domains but with an overall rating of unclear risk of bias, owing to unclear details on one signalling question within the analysis domain (table 2 provides a summary). Jehi and colleagues presented findings from developing a diagnostic model, however, there was substantial missing data and it remains unclear whether the use of median imputation influenced results, and there are unexplained discrepancies between the online calculator, nomogram, and published logistic regression model. 141 Hence, the calculator should not be used without further validation. Knight and colleagues developed a prognostic model for in-hospital mortality, however, continuous predictors were dichotomised, which reduces granularity of predicted risks (even though the model had a C index comparable with that of a generalised additive model). 143 The model was also converted into an sum score, but it was unclear how the scores were translated to the predicted mortality risks that were used to evaluate calibration.Ninety eight models (42%) had a high risk of bias for the participants domain, which indicates that the participants enrolled in the studies might not be representative of the models' targeted populations.

        <p>Forty six models were developed and externally validated in the same study (in an independent dataset, excluding random training test splits and temporal splits). In addition, 24 external validations of models were developed for covid-19 or before the covid-19 pandemic in separate studies. However, none of the external validations was scored as low risk of bias, three were rated as unclear risk of bias, and 67 were rated as high risk of bias. One common concern is that datasets used for the external validation were likely not representative of the target population (eg, patients not being recruited consecutively, use of an inappropriate study design, use of unrepresentative controls, exclusion of patients still in follow-up).

        <p>Generally, studies did not clearly report which patients had imaging during clinical routine. Fifty five (73%) used an inappropriate or unclear study design to collect data (eg, a non-nested case-control).

Outcome definitions were often not defined or determined in the same way in all participants (18 models, 24%). Diagnostic model studies that used medical images as predictors were all scored as unclear on the predictor domain. These publications often lacked clear information on the preprocessing steps (eg, cropping of images). Moreover, complex machine learning algorithms transform images into predictors in a complex way, which makes it challenging to fully apply the PROBAST predictors section for such imaging studies. However, a more favourable assessment of the predictor domain does not lead to better overall judgment regarding risk of bias for the included models. Careful description of model specification and subsequent estimation were frequently lacking, challenging the transparency and reproducibility of the models.

        <p>In this systematic review of prediction models related to the covid-19 pandemic, we identified and critically appraised 232 models described in 169 studies. These prediction models can be divided into three categories: models for the general population to predict the risk of having covid-19 or being admitted to hospital for covid-19; models to support the diagnosis of covid-19 in patients with suspected infection; and models to support the prognostication of patients with covid-19. All models reported moderate to excellent predictive performance, but all were appraised to have high or uncertain risk of bias owing to a combination of poor reporting and poor methodological conduct for participant selection, predictor description, and statistical methods used. Models were developed on data from different countries, but the majority used data from a single country. Often, the available sample sizes and number of events for the outcomes of interest were limited. This problem is well known when building prediction models and increases the risk of overfitting the model. 190 A high risk of bias implies that the performance of these models in new samples will probably be worse than that reported by the researchers. Therefore, the estimated C indices, often close to 1 and indicating near perfect discrimination, are probably optimistic. The majority of studies developed new models specifically for covid-19, but only 46 carried out an external validation, and calibration was rarely assessed. We cannot yet recommend any of the identified prediction models for widespread use in clinical practice, although a few diagnostic and prognostic models originated from studies that were clearly of better quality. We suggest that these models should be further validated in other data sets, and ideally by independent investigators. 141 143In this systematic review of prediction models related to the covid-19 pandemic, we identified and critically appraised 232 models described in 169 studies.

        <p>The main aim of prediction models is to support medical decision making in individual patients. Therefore, it is vital to identify a target setting in which predictions serve a clinical need (eg, emergency department, intensive care unit, general practice, symptom monitoring app in the general population), and a representative dataset from that setting (preferably comprising consecutive patients) on which the prediction model can be developed and validated. This clinical setting and patient characteristics should be described in detail (including timing within the disease course, the severity of disease at the moment of prediction, and the comorbidity), so that readers and clinicians are able to understand if the proposed model could be suited for their population. Unfortunately, the studies included in our systematic review often lacked an adequate description of the target setting and study population, which leaves users of these models in doubt about the models' applicability. Although we recognise that the earlier studies were done under severe time constraints, we recommend that any studies currently in preprint and all future studies Covid-19 prediction will often not present as a simple binary classification task. Complexities in the data should be handled appropriately. For example, a prediction horizon should be specified for prognostic outcomes (eg, 30 day mortality). If study participants have neither recovered nor died within that time period, their data should not be excluded from analysis, which some reviewed studies have done. Instead, an appropriate time to event analysis should be considered to allow for administrative censoring. 13 Censoring for other reasons, for instance because of quick recovery and loss to follow-up of patients who are no longer at risk of death from covid-19, could necessitate analysis in a competing risk framework. 191 We reviewed 75 studies that used only medical images to diagnose covid-19, covid-19 related pneumonia, or to assist in segmentation of lung images, the majority using advanced machine learning methodology. The predictive performance measures showed a high to almost perfect ability to identify covid-19, although these models and their evaluations also had a high risk of bias, notably because of poor reporting and an artificial mix of patients with and without covid-19. Currently, none of these models is recommended to be used in clinical practice. An independent systematic review and critical appraisal (using PROBAST 12 ) of machine learning models for covid-19 using chest radiographs and CT scans came to the same conclusions, even though they focused on models that met a minimum requirement of study quality based on specialised quality metrics for the assessment of radiomics and deep-learning based diagnostic models in radiology. 192 A prediction model applied in a new healthcare setting or country often produces predictions that are miscalibrated 193 and might need to be updated before it can safely be applied in that new setting. 13 This requires data from patients with covid-19 to be available from that system. Instead of developing and updating predictions in their local setting, individual participant data from multiple countries and healthcare systems might allow better understanding of the generalisability and implementation of prediction models across different settings and populations. This approach could greatly improve the applicability and robustness of prediction models in routine care. [194][195][196][197][198] The evidence base for the development and validation of prediction models related to covid-19 will continue to increase over the coming months.

In addition, these models' transportability to other countries settings remains to be investigated. Owing to differences between healthcare systems (eg, Chinese and European) and over time in when patients are admitted to and discharged from hospital, as well as the testing criteria for patients with suspected covid-19, we anticipate most existing models will be miscalibrated, but researchers could attempt to update and adjust the model to the local setting.All reviewed prediction models were found to have an unclear or high risk of bias, and evidence from independent external validations of the newly 202 and they could even cause more harm than good. 203 Therefore, we cannot recommend any model for use in practice at this point.

Owing to differences between healthcare systems (eg, Chinese and European) and over time in when patients are admitted to and discharged from hospital, as well as the testing criteria for patients with suspected covid-19, we anticipate most existing models will be miscalibrated, but researchers could attempt to update and adjust the model to the local setting.</p>
        <p>Most reviewed models used data from a hospital setting, but few are available for primary care and the general population. Additional research is needed, including validation of any recently proposed models not yet included in the current update of the living review (eg, Clift et al 204 ). The models reviewed to date predicted the covid-19 diagnosis or assess the risk of mortality or deterioration, whereas long term morbidity and functional outcomes remain understudied and could be a target outcome of interest in future studies developing prediction models. 205 206 When creating a new prediction model, we recommend building on previous literature and expert opinion to select predictors, rather than selecting predictors in a purely data driven way. 13 This is especially important for datasets with limited sample size. 207 Frequently used predictors included in multiple models identified by our review are vital signs, age, comorbidities, and image features, and these should be considered when appropriate. Flu-like symptoms should be considered in diagnostic models, and sex, C reactive protein, and lymphocyte counts could be considered as prognostic factors.Most reviewed models used data from a hospital setting, but few are available for primary care and the general population.

        <p>By pointing to the most important methodological challenges and issues in design and reporting of the currently available models, we hope to have provided a useful starting point for further studies, which should preferably validate and update existing ones. This living systematic review has been conducted in collaboration with the Cochrane Prognosis Methods Group. We will update this review and appraisal continuously to provide up-to-date information for healthcare decision makers and professionals as more international research emerges over time. conclusion Several diagnostic and prognostic models for covid-19 are currently available and they all report moderate to excellent discrimination. However, these models are all at high or unclear risk of bias, mainly because of model overfitting, inappropriate model evaluation (eg, calibration ignored), use of inappropriate data sources and unclear reporting. Therefore, their performance estimates are probably optimistic and not representative for the target population. The COVID-PRECISE group does not recommend any of the current prediction models to be used in practice, but one diagnostic and one prognostic model originated from higher quality studies and should be (independently) validated in other datasets. For details of the reviewed models, see https://www.covprecise.org/. Future studies aimed at developing and validating diagnostic or prognostic models for covid-19 should explicitly describe the concerns raised and follow existing methodological guidance for prediction modeling studies, because unreliable predictions could cause more harm than benefit in guiding clinical decisions. Prediction model authors should adhere to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) reporting guideline. Finally, sharing data and expertise for the validation and updating of covid-19 related prediction models is urgently needed.By pointing to the most important methodological challenges and issues in design and reporting of the currently available models, we hope to have provided a useful starting point for further studies, which should preferably validate and update existing ones.
