        <p>Based on the profile of genetic alterations occurring in tumor samples from selected diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients, 2 recent whole-exome sequencing studies proposed partially overlapping classification systems. Using clustering techniques applied to targeted sequencing data derived from a large unselected population-based patient cohort with full clinical follow-up (n 5 928), we investigated whether molecular subtypes can be robustly identified using methods potentially applicable in routine clinical practice. DNA extracted from DLBCL tumors diagnosed in patients residing in a catchment population of ∼4 million (14 centers) were sequenced with a targeted 293-gene hematologicalmalignancy panel. Bernoulli mixture-model clustering was applied and the resulting subtypes analyzed in relation to their clinical characteristics and outcomes. Five molecular subtypes were resolved, termed MYD88, BCL2, SOCS1/SGK1, TET2/SGK1, and NOTCH2, along with an unclassified group. The subtypes characterized by genetic alterations of BCL2, NOTCH2, and MYD88 recapitulated recent studies showing good, intermediate, and poor prognosis, respectively. The SOCS1/SGK1 subtype showed biological overlap with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma and conferred excellent prognosis. Although not identified as a distinct cluster, NOTCH1 mutation was associated with poor prognosis. The impact of TP53 mutation varied with genomic subtypes, conferring no effect in the NOTCH2 subtype and poor prognosis in the MYD88 subtype. Our findings confirm the existence of molecular subtypes of DLBCL, providing evidence that genomic tests have prognostic significance in nonselected DLBCL patients. The identification of both good and poor risk subtypes in patients treated with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) clearly show the clinical value of the approach, confirming the need for a consensus classification.

        <p>Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma. [1][2][3] Although potentially curable with immunochemotherapy, refractory or relapsed lymphoma occurs in ;40% of patients. Despite the substantial increase in biological understanding in recent years, attempts to improve survival by combining standard therapy with novel targeted agents have thus far yielded disappointing results, with no phase 3 trial leading to a change in the accepted standard of care since the addition of rituximab to cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) chemotherapy in 2002. 4 One barrier to the effective use of novel therapies targeting specific pathways is the biological heterogeneity of DLBCL and the likely existence of multiple distinct disease subtypes. Hence, to permit more accurate targeting in clinical trials, it is becoming increasingly important to define these subtypes, permitting stratification that separates patients likely to achieve cure with R-CHOP alone from high-risk groups that may benefitf r o m emerging therapies.Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

        <p>DNA was extracted from surplus FFPE material archived at the time of diagnostic biopsy using the Qiagen QIAamp DNA FFPE tissue kit (catalog no. 51306). For each sample, 50 to 200 ng of genomic DNA was sheared by using a Covaris LE220 focused ultrasonicator (Covaris) to produce 100 to 200 bp fragments. Indexed libraries were generated by using a modified version of the SureSelect XT protocol (Agilent Technologies), pooled (16plex), and captured with a bespoke set of 120 nt biotinylated RNA baits (Agilent Technologies); this approach covered 293 genes implicated in hematological malignancy (supplemental Table 1) using the

            <rs type="creator">Agilent Technologies</rs>) on default parameters (all coding exons of all genes targeted with 10 flanking bases at 39 and 59 end of each exon). Capture libraries were quantified, assessed for size distribution and quality, and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2500 instruments using 75 base paired-end sequencing according to the manufacturer's instructions. The average read depth across all samples was 5003 reads per base. Full details of sequencing, variant calling, and annotation are provided in the supplemental Methods (section 2.1). Single nucleotide variants and copy number variants are detailed in supplemental Tables 2 and3.

        <p>Individual biopsy samples were associated with a median of 7 driver mutations (supplemental Figure 2). In 49 patients (5.3%), no genetic abnormality was detected. Genetic alterations stratified according to cell of origin confirmed that when applied to FFPE material, our sequencing platform and variant calling strategy identified mutational profiles in close agreement with previous studies (supplemental Figure 2).

These were named MYD88, BCL2, TET2/SGK1, SOCS1/SGK1, and NOTCH2, according to the genetic features most enriched in each cluster, leaving 27% of patients as "not elsewhere classified" (NEC) (Figure 1).

        <p>The MYD88 cluster (n 5 152) was dominated by mutation of MYD88 (L265P), PIM1, CD79B, and ETV6 and frequent loss of CDKN2A; the available gene expression data showed that most belonged to the ABC subtype, with enrichment for signatures associated with ABC-DLBCL, IRF4, and MYC (Figure 2). To assess biological features of DLBCL independent of anatomic site of presentation, we included special site DLBCL in our primary clustering. However, very similar results were observed when such cases were excluded and clustering restricted to DLBCL NOS (supplemental Figure 8). The majority of primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSL), along with primary testicular and those with breast involvement, clustered within this group (Table 2). This cluster strongly recapitulates the recently described MCD 16 and C5 17 subtypes.The MYD88 cluster (n 5 152) was dominated by mutation of MYD88 (L265P), PIM1, CD79B, and ETV6 and frequent loss of CDKN2A; the available gene expression data showed that most belonged to the ABC subtype, with enrichment for signatures associated with ABC-DLBCL, IRF4, and MYC (Figure 2).

        <p>The BCL2 cluster (n 5 176) showed frequent mutation of EZH2, BCL2, CREBBP, TNFRSF14, KMT2D, and MEF2B. The majority of cases for whom fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was available (82 of 92) had a t(14:18) BCL2 translocation, and mutation of BCL2 was strongly correlated with this translocation (P , .0001). Gene expression revealed a predominance of GCB-DLBCL but also enrichment for MHG DLBCL (Table 2; Figure 2). Most cases of transformed follicular lymphoma fell within this cluster, robustly mapping to the previously described EZB and C3 clusters. 16,17 The SOCS1/SGK1 group (n 5 111) was characterized by mutations, including SOCS1, CD83, SGK1, NFKBIA, HIST1H1E, and STAT3. Several of these genes, including SOCS1, were known targets of aberrant somatic hypermutation. This cluster seems to represent a subdivision of the recently described C4 cluster. 17 SOCS1 mutation is a finding shared with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). The inclusion of cases diagnosed as PMBCL in our clustering allowed the demonstration that 12 of 20 PMCBL cases clustered in this group along with 98 DLBCL NOS cases. The latter cases in this cluster showed no pathological features of PMBCL and were not enriched for mediastinal involvement (supplemental Figure 9). Gene expression profiling showed that DLBCL NOS cases in this group were predominantly of GCB origin and enriched for signatures associated with PMBCL and JAK/STAT signaling, suggesting a degree of biological similarity to PMBCL 29 (Figure 2). Enrichment was also seen for other genes previously noted to be enriched in PMBCL, including ITPKB, NFKBIE, and CIITA. 30 These results suggest that PMBCL, a lymphoma with a unique anatomic location, shares significant molecular overlap with a subset of otherwise nodal DLBCL, supporting a previous description of nonmediastinal DLBCL tumors that share biological similarity to PMBCL. 29 This also recapitulates the findings observed for the relation between PCNSL, primary testicular and primary breast DLCBL, and the MYD88 group of DLCBL NOS, supporting a more general overlap between special site lymphomas and specific molecular subsets of DLBCL NOS.The BCL2 cluster (n 5 176) showed frequent mutation of EZH2, BCL2, CREBBP, TNFRSF14, KMT2D, and MEF2B.

        <p>The TET2/SGK1 (n 5 98) cluster was characterized by mutations including TET2, SGK1, KLHL6, ZFP36L1, BRAF, MAP2K1, and KRAS. The mutation of multiple components of the ERK pathway was associated with enrichment of gene expression signatures of RAS and ERK (Figure 2). Predominantly GCB in origin, these cases seem to represent a second subdivision of the recently described C4 cluster. 17 A final NOTCH2 cluster (n 5 143) was characterized by mutations including NOTCH2, BCL10, TNFAIP3, CCND3, SPEN, TMEM30A FAS, and CD70. Our targeted panel did not capture BCL6 fusion status, although BCL6 rearrangement by using FISH, where available (317 of 928), confirmed a strong correlation with NOTCH2 mutation (P , .0001). Gene expression showed that this cluster comprised a mixture of ABC, GCB, and unclassified DLBCL (Table 2). Enhanced NOTCH activity was not detected by gene expression, nor could we detect transcriptional evidence of increased NOTCH activity when restricting analysis to patients with NOTCH2 mutation. The mutational similarities suggest biological similarity to marginal zone lymphoma; a preexisting diagnosis of marginal zone lymphoma was noted only in 3 patients. This group corresponds closely to the previously described BN2 16 or C1 17 subtypes.The TET2/SGK1 (n 5 98) cluster was characterized by mutations including TET2, SGK1, KLHL6, ZFP36L1, BRAF, MAP2K1, and KRAS.

        <p>To further explore the relation of clusters defined in our data sets to those of other cohorts recently defined, we took advantage of published data from Chapuy et al. 17 We considered this from 2 angles: first, by applying our Bernoulli clustering approach to their total data set; and second, by restricting analysis to the features in common between our data set and theirs. With respect to the former, our algorithm identified 6 clusters, largely recapitulating those published by Chapuy et al (supplemental Figure 10). Genetic features enriched within these clusters closely matched those enriched in the data of Chapuy et al, as well as those enriched in clusters within our patient cohort (supplemental Table 7). However, we were not able to resolve a division of the SGK1 subgroup, which in our cohort splits into SOCS1/SGK1 and TET2/SGK1 subgroups, a finding likely to be explained by the lack of SOCS1 and TET2 mutation calls in the data of Chapuy et al. Restricting the analysis to the 60 overlapping genetic features reproduced 5 of the original subgroups but led to loss of the cluster defined by TP53 mutation and copy number alteration (CNA), which corresponded to the C2 cluster of Chapuy et al (supplemental Figure 11). These cases were instead predominantly reassigned to the unclassified group (56%) and the BCL2 group (22.7%). Taken together, these findings confirm that our clustering approach is robust across data sets and that the absence of a TP53 cluster in our own cohort relates to limited copy number information available from our panel; the majority of cases likely to remain unclassified or allocated to the BCL2 group.To further explore the relation of clusters defined in our data sets to those of other cohorts recently defined, we took advantage of published data from Chapuy et al. 17 We considered this from 2 angles: first, by applying our Bernoulli clustering approach to their total data set; and second, by restricting analysis to the features in common between our data set and theirs. With respect to the former, our algorithm identified 6 clusters, largely recapitulating those published by Chapuy et al (supplemental Figure 10). Genetic features enriched within these clusters closely matched those enriched in the data of Chapuy et al, as well as those enriched in clusters within our patient cohort (supplemental Table 7). However, we were not able to resolve a division of the SGK1 subgroup, which in our cohort splits into SOCS1/SGK1 and TET2/SGK1 subgroups, a finding likely to be explained by the lack of SOCS1 and TET2 mutation calls in the data of Chapuy et al. Restricting the analysis to the 60 overlapping genetic features reproduced 5 of the original subgroups but led to loss of the cluster defined by TP53 mutation and copy number alteration (CNA), which corresponded to the C2 cluster of Chapuy et al (supplemental Figure 11). These cases were instead predominantly reassigned to the unclassified group (56%) and the BCL2 group (22.7%). Taken together, these findings confirm that our clustering approach is robust across data sets and that the absence of a TP53 cluster in our own cohort relates to limited copy number information available from our panel; the majority of cases likely to remain unclassified or allocated to the BCL2 group.</p>

There were insufficient numbers of events to determine the effect of MYC rearrangement, double hit lymphoma, or MHG in other clusters (supplemental Figure 13). Also strongly enriched within the BCL2 cluster were cases of transformed follicular lymphoma and cases of DLBCL with a concurrent diagnosis of follicular lymphoma detected based on results of the diagnostic biopsy. Although patients with transformed follicular lymphoma had inferior survival estimates, in the BCL2 cluster, no differences in survival between DLBCL with/without a concurrent diagnosis of follicular lymphoma was observed.

        <p>As noted earlier, we did not identify a distinct TP53/CNA cluster in our cohort. The potential for other clusters, in particular the BCL2 subgroup, to contain cases that might otherwise have been classified to a TP53 cluster prompted us to examine survival of each cluster stratified according to TP53 mutation status. Remarkably, the prognostic impact of TP53 mutation (Figure 4C) varied considerably across the different molecular subtypes (Figure 4D). TP53 mutation was associated with a worse prognosis in the NEC and BCL2 subtypes and, although uncommon, TP53 mutation conferred an extremely poor prognosis in the MYD88cluster.Incontrast,therewasnoevidenceofaprognostic effect in patients within the NOTCH2 or SOCS1/SGK1 clusters, and was rarely detected in the TET2/SGK1 cluster.

        <p>Based on the genomic profile of individual tumors, our large population-based study defined 5 molecular DLBCL subtypes, named MYD88, BCL2, SOCS1/SGK1, TET2/SGK1, and NOTCH2, with each having distinct features in terms of both their biology and clinical outcome. With prospective tracking of treatment and outcome in 928 patients with DLBCL (trial and nontrial) diagnosed by specialist staff at a single laboratory, we escape the biases that may result from sequencing archived biopsy collections established from the selective referral of clinically or diagnostically challenging cases to specialist pathology centers. Indeed, the only determinant of whether patients were included in the analysis cohort was the availability of sufficientsamplefortheextractionof adequate DNA. This unselected cohort therefore provides a unique representation of real-world DLBCL that may not have been captured in previous molecular subtyping studies. We have not restricted the cluster analysis to any particular subtype of DLBCL, considering an a priori approach to the evolving classification of these possibly heterogeneous disease types a particular strength of this study.Based on the genomic profile of individual tumors, our large population-based study defined 5 molecular DLBCL subtypes, named MYD88, BCL2, SOCS1/SGK1, TET2/SGK1, and NOTCH2, with each having distinct features in terms of both their biology and clinical outcome.

        <p>Considerable variability in genomic subtype identification can be introduced by differences in biopsy type, sequencing strategy, variant calling pipeline, driver annotation algorithms, and the statistical method used to identify genomic clusters. It remained uncertain whether the genomic clusters described in recent studies represented sufficiently robust entities to be resolved against variation in each of the aforementioned factors. We used alternative, but widely accepted, pipelines for variant and driver annotation and different approaches to the identification of genomic clusters. Despite these considerable differences, we have independently converged on very similar genomic subtypes. Indeed, when comparing enriched mutations between equivalent clusters across studies, we observe a very high degree of overlap. Therefore, our data strongly support the conclusion that DLBCL exists as molecularly distinct subtypes that are resolvable through genomic analysis. Importantly, we were able to identify these subtypes by using a targeted sequencing panel applied to biopsy material, a strategy that would be applicable to a nonacademic diagnostic laboratory.Considerable variability in genomic subtype identification can be introduced by differences in biopsy type, sequencing strategy, variant calling pipeline, driver annotation algorithms, and the statistical method used to identify genomic clusters.

        <p>The lack of BCL6 fusion data is a limitation of our study. However, available FISH data confirmed the association between NOTCH2 mutation and rearrangement of BCL6. Furthermore, even in the absence of BCL6 fusion data, we were able to identify a NOTCH2 subtype that shows mutation enrichment similar to the previously identified BN2/C1 16,17 clusters. Our study was also limited by the extent of copy number data available from our panel. As such, we did not resolve a subgroup mapping to the C2 cluster of Chapuy et al. 17 The application of our clustering algorithm to the data of Chapuy et al, applying all or just overlapping genetic features, supports the existence of this subtype and the requirement for adequate copy number information for its detection. Future sequencing panels designed to assign DLBCL molecular subtype will likely include probes that target regions of recurrent copy number variability. The existence of a TP53/CNA cluster is further supported by the finding that the majority (56%) of these cases were not alternatively classified but rather assigned to an unclassified NEC group according to our cluster algorithm (supplemental Figure 11). However, 23% of the TP53/CNA cases carried a mutational profile that, in the absence of copy number data, reassigns them to the BCL2 cluster. This leads us to hypothesize that TP53 mutation and associated CNAs may arise in 2 different contexts: either as the primary determinant of a distinct disease subtype or alternatively as a secondary event in a tumor arising from one of the other subgroups, most commonly the BCL2 cluster.The lack of BCL6 fusion data is a limitation of our study.

        <p>A novel finding in our study was the division of the previously identified SGK1 cluster 17 into SOCS1/SGK1 and TET2/SGK1 subgroups, the biological validity of which was supported by the enrichment of JAK/STAT and ERK gene expression signatures, respectively. Driver mutations of TET2 and SOCS1 were not reported in the earlier study, 17 which impaired the ability of our clustering algorithm to resolve this split within the data of Chapuy et al. These differences in mutation calling, likely due to differences in variant and driver annotation strategies, highlight some of the challenges to be overcome when implementing a consensus classification system. Interestingly, our SOCS1/SGK1 subtype shared both mutation and gene expression profile similarities with PMBCL, supporting a previous description of non-mediastinal DLBCL tumors that share biological similarity with PMBCL. 29 This analysis also has parallels with other subsets of special site lymphomas, including PCNSL and those occurring de novo in testis and breast, which overlap with the MYD88 subgroup; this finding highlights a recurrent link between special site and nodal DLBCL NOS across several molecular subsets.A novel finding in our study was the division of the previously identified SGK1 cluster 17 into SOCS1/SGK1 and TET2/SGK1 subgroups, the biological validity of which was supported by the enrichment of JAK/STAT and ERK gene expression signatures, respectively.

This difference in outcome when analysis of MYD88 patients is restricted to those treated with full R-CHOP vs other R-CHOP-like regimens may explain some of the controversy around the prognostic impact of this group. 31 Multivariate analysis allowed us to quantify the relative risk of individual subtypes independent of IPI factors, an analysis that reinforced the importance of clinical risk factors in determining prognosis.Prospective clinical data on all cases (supplemental Table 4) provided greater insight into the prognostic impact of clusters, revealing how survival of MYD88 clustered patients was especially sensitive to either patient-intrinsic or treatment-related characteristics.
