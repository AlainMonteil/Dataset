        <p>This document is an update to the 2013 publication of the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (SCMR) Board of Trustees Task Force on Standardized Protocols. Concurrent with this publication, 3 additional task forces will publish documents that should be referred to in conjunction with the present document. The first is a document on the Clinical Indications for CMR, an update of the 2004 document. The second task force will be updating the document on Reporting published by that SCMR Task Force in 2010. The 3rd task force will be updating the 2013 document on Post-Processing. All protocols relative to congenital heart disease are covered in a separate document. The section on general principles and techniques has been expanded as more of the techniques common to CMR have been standardized. A section on imaging in patients with devices has been added as this is increasingly seen in day-to-day clinical practice. The authors hope that this document continues to standardize and simplify the patient-based approach to clinical CMR. It will be updated at regular intervals as the field of CMR advances.This document is an update to the 2013 publication of the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (SCMR) Board of Trustees Task Force on Standardized Protocols.

        <p>1. Electrocardiographic (ECG) gating may be more problematic at 3 T than at 1.5 T. In cases where the ECG signal is unreliable, peripheral pulse gating may succeed for acquisitions that are amenable to retrospective gating, such as cine imaging. 2. As a result of improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), 3 T may be advantageous for first pass contrast-enhanced perfusion imaging and late gadolinium enhancement. Furthermore, tagging sequences and 4D flow techniques may benefit from imaging at 3 T. 3. Balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) is well established as the default method of choice for cine imaging at 1.5 T. At 3 T, however, the increased sensitivity of bSSFP to off-resonance effects tends to worsen dark banding and flow artifacts. To mitigate these artifacts, it may be necessary to perform careful shimming. In rare cases, patient-specific frequency adjustment may be required. 4. Devices that have been tested and determined to be safe at 1.5 T may not be safe at 3 T. Please check specific information relating to CMR safety of devices at higher magnetic field strengths. (Please see section 1.6 below.)1. Electrocardiographic (ECG) gating may be more problematic at 3 T than at 1.5 T.

        <p>Equipment considerations CMR scanner 1. MR scanners for clinical CMR should have field strength of ≥1.0 T; however, the typical field strength employed is 1.5 T with a number of centers using 3 T scanners. 2. A cardiac imaging specific surface coil with multiple coil elements (typically ≥8 elements) is highly recommended, and is required to employ parallel imaging techniques that reduce scan and breathhold times. 3. ECG-gating hardware and software are required, and preferably incorporate vector-cardiographic gating. ECG-gating capabilities should include the ability to perform prospective gating, retrospective gating, and triggered gating techniques.Equipment considerations CMR scanner 1.

        <p>Safety considerations:Safety considerations:</p>
        <p>1. More than 300 million GBCA doses have been applied worldwide since 1988 [5]. GBCAs provide crucial medical information in many applications and have an excellent safety profile. 2. However, nephrogenic systemic sclerosis (NSF) and long-term gadolinium retention in the brain have resulted in regulatory actions. 3. In 2017 the European Medicines Agency (EMA) decided to suspend the marketing authorizations of all multipurpose linear GBCAs and to continue to use all macrocyclic GBCAs. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) maintained all GBCAs but decided that warnings have to be included in the prescribing information that communicates the greater risk of gadolinium deposition when using linear GBCAs. Additionally, product information updates should incorporate risk mitigation steps and a Medication Guide for each product. 4. Healthcare professionals should consider the retention characteristics of each agent when choosing a GBCA, and particularly for patients who may be at higher risk for gadolinium retention or NSF [6]. 5. The dose of GBCA in all CMR applications should be as low as possible to achieve adequate image quality, and the prescribing information of the products as well as the institutional, regional or national guidelines have to be respected. 6. Noncontrast techniques should be considered as alternatives for contrast-enhanced techniques whenever possible.1. More than 300 million GBCA doses have been applied worldwide since 1988 [5].

        <p>1. Pulse sequences: A "TI scout", which is a cine sequence with an inversion pulse that is played at the beginning of the R-wave, can be used as a rough guide to set the TI. However, the TI scout sequence usually does not have the identical readout parameters as the segmented LGE sequence and hence the correct TI may be up to 50 ms different between the two sequences. Alternatively, a PSIR sequence can be used, which obviates the need for a precise setting of the TI. a. Imaging using a "long-inversion" time (~550 ms at 1.5 T and 850 ms at 3 T) can be helpful in distinguishing no-reflow zones or mural thrombus from viable myocardium. b. Imaging using a short inversion time (~200 ms) and PSIR can be helpful in distinguishing subendocardial scar. 8. Read-out is usually every other heartbeat, but should be modified to every heartbeat in the setting of bradycardia (&lt; 60 bpm), and every third heartbeat in the setting of tachycardia (&gt; 100 bpm) or arrhythmia. 9. Dark-blood LGE imaging (optional) a. If available, flow independent "dark-blood" techniques may be helpful in differentiating subendocardial LGE from blood-pool compared with conventional LGE imaging. b. Settings, except for inversion time (which is set according to the specific sequence that is used), are similar to conventional LGE imaging.1.
