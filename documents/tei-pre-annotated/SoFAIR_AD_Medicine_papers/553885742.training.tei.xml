        <p>The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) pandemic has attracted interest because of its global rapid spread, clinical severity, high mortality rate and capacity to overwhelm healthcare systems [1,2]. SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs mainly through droplets, although surface contamination contributes and debate continues on aerosol transmission [3][4][5].The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) pandemic has attracted interest because of its global rapid spread, clinical severity, high mortality rate and capacity to overwhelm healthcare systems [1,2].

        <p>One case-control study of COVID-19 patients with interferon-γ release assay-confirmed TB infection [10] and a single case of TB with COVID-19 have been submitted to, but not yet published in, peer-reviewed journals [11]. In a recent analysis of 1217 consecutive respiratory specimens collected from COVID-19 patients (Mycobacterium tuberculosis was not tested), the authors concluded that higher rates of co-infection between SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens can be expected [12].One case-control study of COVID-19 patients with interferon-γ release assay-confirmed TB infection [10] and a single case of TB with COVID-19 have been submitted to, but not yet published in, peer-reviewed journals [11].

        <p>2) The diagnosis of TB and COVID-19 was done simultaneously or within 7 days in nine patients, posing differential diagnosis challenges, suggesting that clinical assessments to investigate COVID-19 (e.g. clinical picture, HRCT) facilitated the identification of (a probably pre-existing) TB. Any contribution of COVID-19 to TB pathogenesis cannot be excluded or confirmed. 3) Although the diagnosis of COVID-19 preceded that of TB in 14 patients, larger studies are needed to understand any role played by SARS-CoV-2 in the progression of TB infection to disease. Given that up to a quarter of the population in some of the regions studied are latently infected, SARS-CoV-2 infection might boost the development of active TB in the coming months [10]. As we do not include individuals with latent TB infection followed up over time, we cannot report on the potential contribution of COVID-19 towards development of active disease. Probably, an overlap of signs/ symptoms of COVID-19 and TB occurred, and COVID-19 was diagnosed earlier because of a higher index of suspicion, while TB may have been previously present. Or, differently, COVID brought to clinical evaluation/diagnostic assessment TB patients at an earlier stage of disease, before the occurrence of TB-related symptoms. 4) In seven cases, COVID-19 occurred in patients with TB sequelae. They were older than patients under anti-TB treatment and presented higher (although not statistically significant) mortality. All but one had comorbidities (four COPD; one HIV co-infection plus liver and kidney diseases, hypertension and cancer present in different combinations). They presented unilateral or bilateral radiological sequelae of previous infiltrates (four patients) or cavities (three patients). Larger numbers are necessary to further understand the role played by TB sequelae. 5) The impact on the healthcare system (days of admission, intensive care unit beds, etc.) was relevant, and will deserve further evaluation. 6) The information on BCG (bacillus Calmette-Guérin) vaccination is modest (30 patients with information, 19 previously vaccinated in all eight countries) and no significant elements can be provided to the ongoing debate on its protective role. 7) We presently have no data on drug-drug interactions. This is, to our knowledge, the first published cohort of patients with active TB and COVID-19. Our study represents a "snapshot" of a cohort of patients at different stages of disease. No attempt was made to obtain representation of the larger universe of patients with both diseases and the small sample size precludes an analysis of risk factors. We cannot exclude that some findings have a casual origin.2) The diagnosis of TB and COVID-19 was done simultaneously or within 7 days in nine patients, posing differential diagnosis challenges, suggesting that clinical assessments to investigate COVID-19 (e.g. clinical picture, HRCT) facilitated the identification of (a probably pre-existing) TB.

        <p>The information available on the patients recently admitted was accurate, but some details on previous TB were incomplete, and some examinations were not performed either because the patients refused or the patients' condition was too severe. Although case reporting is comprehensive in the countries/regions covered by GTN, the study reflects the initial stages of the COVID-19 epidemic only, and representative longitudinal observations will be necessary to evaluate the interactions between COVID-19 and TB.The information available on the patients recently admitted was accurate, but some details on previous TB were incomplete, and some examinations were not performed either because the patients refused or the patients' condition was too severe.

        <p>We believe that this descriptive research can motivate larger studies to enable analyses of interactions and determinants of outcomes in patients with both diseases.
