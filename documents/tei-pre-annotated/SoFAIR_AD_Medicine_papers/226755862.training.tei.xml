        <p>Awareness of the human health benefits of blueberries is underpinned by a growing body of positive scientific evidence from human observational and clinical research, plus mechanistic research using animal and in vitro models. Blueberries contain a large number of phytochemicals, including abundant anthocyanin pigments. Of their various phytochemicals, anthocyanins probably make the greatest impact on blueberry health functionality. Epidemiological studies associate regular, moderate intake of blueberries and/or anthocyanins with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, death, and type 2 diabetes, and with improved weight maintenance and neuroprotection. These findings are supported by biomarkerbased evidence from human clinical studies. Among the more important healthful aspects of blueberries are their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions and their beneficial effects on vascular and glucoregulatory function. Blueberry phytochemicals may affect gastrointestinal microflora and contribute to host health. These aspects have implications in degenerative diseases and conditions as well as the aging process. More evidence, and particularly human clinical evidence, is needed to better understand the potential for anthocyanin-rich blueberries to benefit public health. However, it is widely agreed that the regular consumption of tasty, ripe blueberries can be unconditionally recommended.Awareness of the human health benefits of blueberries is underpinned by a growing body of positive scientific evidence from human observational and clinical research, plus mechanistic research using animal and in vitro models.

        <p>Blueberries were first popularized as a "super fruit" due mainly to the high in vitro antioxidant capacity of their abundant polyphenolic compounds. However, direct antioxidant action of polyphenolic compounds in situ appears unlikely due to their poor bioavailability (1). Nonetheless, research regarding foods for health performed during the past 2 decades has revealed a multitude of ways in which blueberries are bioactive and beneficial to health. -0 Cherry (sweet) 24 122 Grape 2 Red peel and flesh 5 27 Grape 2 Purple peel and flesh 1 120Blueberries were first popularized as a "super fruit" due mainly to the high in vitro antioxidant capacity of their abundant polyphenolic compounds.

        <p>Blueberry species and composition Blueberry species of commercial importance include highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.), rabbiteye blueberry (V. virgatum Aiton), lowbush blueberry (V. angustifolium Aiton), and European bilberry (V. myrtillus L.). Blueberries are one of the richest sources of anthocyanins among common fruits (10-12) (Table 1). Anthocyanins are the pigments that confer the red, blue, and purple coloration to ripe berries. During berry ripening, anthocyanin content rises dramatically to provide a visual cue to distinguish between early to fully ripe fruit (13). Among a selection of 80 highbush and 135 lowbush blueberry phenotypes, 90% of the phenotypes spanned a 1.6fold range in anthocyanin concentration (14). Among the total 215 blueberry phenotypes, the range between the 10th and 90th percentiles of cyanidin-3-glucoside equivalents/g fresh weight was 0.925 to 2.1 mg (14).Blueberry species and composition Blueberry species of commercial importance include highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.), rabbiteye blueberry (V. virgatum Aiton), lowbush blueberry (V. angustifolium Aiton), and European bilberry (V. myrtillus L.).

        <p>Anthocyanin flavonoids account for up to 60% of the total polyphenolics in ripe blueberries (13). Therefore, anthocyanins probably make the greatest contribution to blueberry health benefits. Blueberry polyphenolic compounds include both flavonoid and nonflavonoid types. Other classes of flavonoids found in blueberries include proanthocyanidins (15,16) and flavonols (17,18). Abundant nonflavonoid polyphenolic compounds in blueberries are the hydroxycinnamic acid esters (especially chlorogenic acid) (16,17,19,20).Anthocyanin flavonoids account for up to 60% of the total polyphenolics in ripe blueberries (13).

        <p>Associating the in vivo metabolites of anthocyanins with health outcomes has been difficult. After ingestion, anthocyanins are converted to a large number of products via chemical events and human and microbial metabolism. Clearance time for anthocyanin metabolites varies widely (21,22). To illustrate, within 6 h after humans ingested 13 C-labeled anthocyanin, substantial 13 C-labeled CO 2 was detected in exhaled breath, which demonstrated rapid and complete anthocyanin catabolism. However, &gt;50% of the 13 C still remained in the body after 48 h (21). Anthocyanins and their phase 2 metabolites persist in urine long after anthocyanin intake (23), probably due to their transport in bile (24,25). Also, anthocyanins and their metabolites become localized in body tissues (24,(26)(27)(28)(29). Due to the catabolic action of gastrointestinal microflora on anthocyanins and other food polyphenolics, phenolic acid products are very abundant in the large intestine (30).Associating the in vivo metabolites of anthocyanins with health outcomes has been difficult.

        <p>The association between a higher anthocyanin intake and reduction in all-cause mortality risk in a meta-analysis of 6 studies was principally due to a decreased cardiovascular mortality risk (31). Similar findings were reported in a meta-analysis of total CVD (RR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.83-0.96) (32). In 3 cohort studies, a higher anthocyanin intake was associated with an ∼25% reduced risk of coronary artery disease, including fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction (33,34). Higher intakes of blueberries, strawberries, and total anthocyanins were all associated with a 32% lower rate of myocardial infarction, and this association was independent of established risk factors (2). However, in 2 prospective cohort studies no association was found between anthocyanin intake and stroke risk (34,35).The association between a higher anthocyanin intake and reduction in all-cause mortality risk in a meta-analysis of 6 studies was principally due to a decreased cardiovascular mortality risk (31).

        <p>Higher anthocyanin intake was associated with an ∼8-10% reduction in hypertension risk in 5 cohort studies (3,36,37). A higher anthocyanin intake was associated with a 10% lower risk of incident hypertension in a cohort of over 87,000 participants examined over a period of 14 y (3). The greatest risk reduction was observed in women aged ≤60 y (3). One biomarker, vascular stiffness, was measured in a cross-sectional study of 1898 carefully phenotyped twins. In this study, a clinically relevant improvement in vascular modulation, measured using pulse wave velocity, was associated with greater anthocyanin intake (6).Higher anthocyanin intake was associated with an ∼8-10% reduction in hypertension risk in 5 cohort studies (3,36,37).

        <p>Population studies in CVD, obesity, berries, and weight maintenance Obesity and overweight are major contributors to CVD risk (38). Even minor weight gain can increase the risk of hypertension (39) and CVD (40,41). Reducing BMI by 1-3 kg/m 2 was associated with a 2-13% lower risk of CVD events (41) and mortality (42). In a comparison of intakes of 16 common fruits, the highest blueberry intake was associated with the least weight gain (-0.64 kg over 4 y) in a prospective study of over 133,000 men and women followed for ≤24 y (43). Among 6 classes of flavonoids, a higher anthocyanin intake had the strongest association with less weight gain (-0.1 kg per 10 mg anthocyanins) in a study of 124,000 individuals (44).Population studies in CVD, obesity, berries, and weight maintenance Obesity and overweight are major contributors to CVD risk (38).

        <p>Greater anthocyanin intake was associated with 3-9% lower fat mass and less central adiposity in healthy female twins (n = 2734) (45) based on body composition assessment using DXA (46). In this study, the twin with the higher blueberry intake had a lower fat mass ratio than the co-twin (45). Results of the twin studies are most interesting because they are independent of genetic and common environmental factors.Greater anthocyanin intake was associated with 3-9% lower fat mass and less central adiposity in healthy female twins (n = 2734) (45) based on body composition assessment using DXA (46).

        <p>In clinical research on blueberries, subjects most often have some CVD risk (e.g., metabolic syndrome markers, T2DM). In a placebo-controlled study of 58 diabetic patients, blueberry intake led to a decline in LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and adiponectin and an increase in HDL cholesterol (47). Intake of purified anthocyanin for 12 wk by 150 hypercholesterolemic subjects was associated with an increase in HDL cholesterol and a decrease in LDL cholesterol as well as improved endothelial function (brachial flow-mediated dilation) (48). Then, after 24 wk of anthocyanin intake by the same 150 hypercholesterolemic patients, a reduction was documented in inflammatory markers, including serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1, and plasma IL-1β (49).In clinical research on blueberries, subjects most often have some CVD risk (e.g., metabolic syndrome markers, T2DM).

        <p>Arterial stiffness was reduced and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were decreased by 5-6% after 8 wk of blueberry intake in women with pre-and stage 1 hypertension (50,51). Similar benefits were observed in middle-aged unmedicated men with CVD risk factors (51). In subjects with metabolic syndrome, vascular endothelial function was improved although blood pressure was unaffected by blueberry intake for 6 wk (52). In a blueberry study examining participants with metabolic syndrome (n = 115), after 6 mo of taking either 0, 75, or 150 g, biomarkers of cardiometabolic function were unchanged in the group taking 75 g blueberries daily. However, the group taking 150 g blueberries daily had sustained improvements in vascular function and lipid status. Insulin resistence was not affected by either dose of blueberries (53). Some clinical studies have reported little to no effect of blueberry intake on blood pressure (54,55). In contrast to these longterm studies, in a 6-h acute study design, blueberry intake was associated with short-term improvements in vascular function measured by flow-mediated dilation in 21 healthy men (56).Arterial stiffness was reduced and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were decreased by 5-6% after 8 wk of blueberry intake in women with pre-and stage 1 hypertension (50,51).

        <p>Blueberries and anthocyanins benefit cardiovascular health via antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects (49,57) positive effects on plasma lipid levels, and modulation of glucose metabolism and endothelial function (see reviews, 58, 59). Blueberries protect vasculature in various ways that can be detected by vascular responsiveness, blood pressure, and arterial stiffness (18,(50)(51)(52)60). These benefits may involve NO metabolism (53,61) and effects on endothelium composition (62) and plasma lipids (47,48,63). Most often, cardiovascular research models employ a relevant stress treatment (e.g., diet or disease) or examine a population with existing risk condition(s).Blueberries and anthocyanins benefit cardiovascular health via antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects (49,57) positive effects on plasma lipid levels, and modulation of glucose metabolism and endothelial function (see reviews, 58, 59).

        <p>Nonflavonoid catabolites of berry anthocyanins predominate in the large intestine (1) and could interact with the microbiota to elicit anti-inflammatory or other responses that contribute to cardioprotective benefits (64). Blueberry supplementation modified the colonic microflora of rats (65,66). By use of gene sequencing, 3 new phyla and 22 new genera of micro-organisms were found to be specifically associated with blueberry feeding (66). These gene changes accounted for ∼9% of the entire genome and were associated with species in the intestinal mucin layer, as well as better protection from bacterial invasion and greater capacity for xenobiotic metabolism (66). In a study with high-fat-fed rats, blueberry intake moderated the negative effects of the highfat diet on inflammation and insulin signaling and also led to modification of the gut microbiota (67).Nonflavonoid catabolites of berry anthocyanins predominate in the large intestine (1) and could interact with the microbiota to elicit anti-inflammatory or other responses that contribute to cardioprotective benefits (64).

        <p>Population studies in T2DM, blueberries, and anthocyanins Prediabetes and T2DM affect ∼100 million adults in the United States (68). Both prediabetes and T2DM are characterized by poor response to insulin stimulation (i.e., insulin resistance) leading to inefficient glucose uptake and metabolism in insulin-sensitive tissues (69). Of all the fruits analyzed in 3 prospective studies, blueberries provided the strongest association, with T2DM risk reduction of 26% (RR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.66-0.83) (70). In the same cohorts, when the intake of habitually consumed flavonoids (flavonols, flavones, flavanones, flavan-3-ols, and anthocyanins) was examined, intake of anthocyanins and particularly blueberries provided a similar degree of risk reduction of 23% with consumption of ≥2 servings weekly or ≤1 serving monthly. There was no association found between the intake of total flavonoid or other flavonoid groups and reduced T2DM risk (4).Population studies in T2DM, blueberries, and anthocyanins Prediabetes and T2DM affect ∼100 million adults in the United States (68).

Oxidative stress and cell proliferation are exacerbated by pathological responses to irradiation of the retina (122), neovascularization (123), and inflammation (124,125).

Enzyme-catalyzed oxidative damage can be mitigated by blanching prior to milling and depectinization (191).

        <p>Shelf-stable blueberry products like jam (196), juice (197), and extracts (198) can lose polyphenolic compounds when stored at ambient temperature whereas refrigeration mitigates losses. Blueberry processing can drastically change fruit composition; therefore, processing methods that optimize extraction and shelf stability of health-beneficial compounds are worthy objectives.Shelf-stable blueberry products like jam (196), juice (197), and extracts (198) can lose polyphenolic compounds when stored at ambient temperature whereas refrigeration mitigates losses.

        <p>Selected research documenting blueberries as a healthpromoting food has been presented. Evidence supporting a role for blueberries and anthocyanins in human health is outlined according to human observational and clinical evidence, followed by mechanistic research using animal and in vitro models. Blueberry treatments generally produce larger effects in experimental models involving stress or disease risk.Selected research documenting blueberries as a healthpromoting food has been presented.

        <p>The relative amount of evidence presented supporting cardiovascular, glucoregulation, neuroprotection, and vision benefits differs. For example, whereas there is abundant epidemiological evidence for the cardioprotective effects of blueberries and anthocyanins, epidemiological evidence for blueberry or anthocyanin benefits in human vision is lacking. And where there is substantial clinical evidence showing blueberry-related improvements in cognition and brain function, there is relatively little epidemiological evidence on anthocyanins in this area.The relative amount of evidence presented supporting cardiovascular, glucoregulation, neuroprotection, and vision benefits differs.

        <p>The anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and vasoprotective effects of blueberry components together contribute to well-regulated glucose delivery to insulin-sensitive tissues and good metabolic function. Each of these aspects has implications in multiple areas of healthy aging. Notably, biomarkers of cardiometabolic dysfunction are associated with risk for vascular and Alzheimer-type dementia in late life (92,93), which may be related to the mitigation of neuroinflammation.The anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and vasoprotective effects of blueberry components together contribute to well-regulated glucose delivery to insulin-sensitive tissues and good metabolic function.

        <p>Improvement in anti-inflammatory biomarkers associated with blueberry intake is supported by observational (8), clinical (48), animal (87), and in vitro (114) evidence. Anti-inflammatory and immune benefits of blueberries may involve mucin-associated and other colonic microbiota (67), which constitutes a new domain for berry health research.Improvement in anti-inflammatory biomarkers associated with blueberry intake is supported by observational (8), clinical (48), animal (87), and in vitro (114) evidence.

        <p>Blueberry benefits have been observed in both short-term (see, for example, references 18, 78, and 100) and long-term human interventions (see, for example, references 76 and 94), which suggests multiple modes of action.Blueberry benefits have been observed in both short-term (see, for example, references 18, 78, and 100) and long-term human interventions (see, for example, references 76 and 94), which suggests multiple modes of action.</p>
        <p>In blueberry health research, several important areas remain poorly understood. For example, the dose dependency of clinical effects is mostly unclear (18,101,142). The bioactivity of anthocyanin metabolites in vivo, both collectively and individually, is still mostly unknown, as is the importance to health of anthocyanins localized in tissues. Another important question is the relative bioactivity in the colon of phenolic breakdown products of blueberry anthocyanins compared with similar phenolic compounds from other plant foods in the diet. Notably, these gaps in knowledge do not detract from our ability to tap into blueberry health benefits by increasing public consumption.In blueberry health research, several important areas remain poorly understood.

        <p>This review of research findings will hopefully aid consumers, healthcare providers, and the food and health industry to understand the current state of knowledge on blueberries and health. It can be safely stated that daily moderate intake (50 mg anthocyanins, one-third cup of blueberries) can mitigate the risk of diseases and conditions of major socioeconomic importance in the Western world.This review of research findings will hopefully aid consumers, healthcare providers, and the food and health industry to understand the current state of knowledge on blueberries and health.
