        <p>Methods: After surgery and chemoradiotherapy, patients were randomized (2:1) to receive temozolomide plus DCVax-L (n = 232) or temozolomide and placebo (n = 99). Following recurrence, all patients were allowed to receive DCVax-L, without unblinding. The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS); the secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS).Methods: After surgery and chemoradiotherapy, patients were randomized (2:1) to receive temozolomide plus DCVax-L (n = 232) or temozolomide and placebo (n = 99).

        <p>Results: For the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (n = 331), median OS (mOS) was 23.1 months from surgery. Because of the cross-over trial design, nearly 90% of the ITT population received DCVax-L. For patients with methylated MGMT (n = 131), mOS was 34.7 months from surgery, with a 3-year survival of 46.4%. As of this analysis, 223 patients are ≥ 30 months past their surgery date; 67 of these (30.0%) have lived ≥ 30 months and have a Kaplan-Meier (KM)derived mOS of 46.5 months. 182 patients are ≥ 36 months past surgery; 44 of these (24.2%) have lived ≥ 36 months and have a KM-derived mOS of 88.2 months. A population of extended survivors (n = 100) with mOS of 40.5 months, not explained by known prognostic factors, will be analyzed further.

        <p>Glioblastoma is the most aggressive primary malignant brain tumor in adults [1]. Standard of care (SOC) consists of surgical resection followed by 6 weeks of daily radiotherapy with concurrent temozolomide, then monthly temozolomide [2]. Median overall survival (mOS) under this SOC is only 15-17 months [2,3], and ≤ 5% of patients are alive at 5 years [3]. Loco-regional therapy with alternating electric fields has recently shown an increase in median PFS (mPFS) to 6.7 months and mOS to 20.9 months from randomization, respectively [4]. However, there has been no material advance in survival with systemic therapies since the addition of temozolomide 12 years ago, despite investigations with many diverse agents [2,[5][6][7][8][9][10].Glioblastoma is the most aggressive primary malignant brain tumor in adults [1].

        <p>Immunotherapy is an appealing strategy because of the potential ability for immune cells to traffic to and destroy infiltrating tumor cells. Dendritic cells (DCs) are central to the immune system as key regulators of immune tolerance and immunity [11]. For more than a decade, our group and others have been testing active vaccination strategies, such as DCs pulsed with tumor lysates or synthetic peptides to induce antitumor immunity in glioblastoma patients [12,13]. We have previously demonstrated the effectiveness of DC vaccination in pre-clinical models [14][15][16], and early stage clinical trials have shown substantial promise [17][18][19].Immunotherapy is an appealing strategy because of the potential ability for immune cells to traffic to and destroy infiltrating tumor cells.

        <p>In this report, we describe the blinded interim data of the overall ITT patient population enrolled in a Phase 3 randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial of an autologous tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cell vaccine (DCVax ® -L) for newly diagnosed glioblastoma. To date, we have not yet reached sufficient events (i.e., deaths) in this trial to justify unblinding. Nevertheless, since the vast majority (86.4%) of the ITT population received the experimental DC treatment at some point during the trial because of the cross-over study design, analysis of the interim data may provide early insight into the impact of DCVax-L on overall survival. A final analysis of the data obtained in this trial following unblinding will occur once sufficient events of disease progression or death have occurred to fully elucidate patient survival data in the tail of the survival curve.In this report, we describe the blinded interim data of the overall ITT patient population enrolled in a Phase 3 randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial of an autologous tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cell vaccine (DCVax ® -L) for newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

        <p>Patients were eligible for this study if they were 18-70 years of age and had newly diagnosed glioblastoma, as determined through central pathology review. Other eligibility criteria included Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) of ≥ 70 [20], adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function, life expectancy of ≥ 8 weeks, no other prior malignancy within the last 5 years, no active viral infections, and sufficient resected tumor material to produce the autologous vaccine. Patients were excluded if they already had apparent early disease progression/recurrence or pseudo-progression at the baseline visit, similar to the inclusion/exclusion criteria of other recent trials in glioblastoma [4,21].Patients were eligible for this study if they were 18-70 years of age and had newly diagnosed glioblastoma, as determined through central pathology review.

        <p>We conducted this study at over 80 sites in 4 countries: the US, Canada, Germany, and the UK. Patient recruitment was initiated in 2007, and was paused from 2009 to 2011 for economic reasons. The midpoint of enrollment was reached in May of 2014, and the final patient was enrolled in November of 2015. The protocol was approved by the required independent ethics committees and institutional review boards. Written consent was obtained from all patients participating in the trial.We conducted this study at over 80 sites in 4 countries: the US, Canada, Germany, and the UK.

        <p>Randomization was performed centrally and was stratified by clinical site and MGMT (O 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) gene promoter methylation status, which was determined by a central laboratory. Patients were randomized 2:1 to SOC plus autologous DC vaccine (DCVax-L; n = 232) or SOC plus placebo (n = 99). PBMCs were used as placebo control as these cells are visually indistinguishable from DC and are considered immunologically inactive.

        <p>All patients were allowed to receive DCVax-L following tumor progression/recurrence, as well as other approved treatments per local practice. All parties (investigators, patients and sponsor) remained blinded as to which treatment each patient had received prior to crossover. All patients who chose this option were given the active treatment on a re-start schedule with immunizations at Days 0, 10 and 20, and then months 2, 4 and 8, and every 6 months thereafter beginning with month 12, with Day 0 being the day of the first vaccination post progression. To date, DCVax-L has been shipped for 286 patients (86.4%) in the trial.All patients were allowed to receive DCVax-L following tumor progression/recurrence, as well as other approved treatments per local practice.

        <p>Both the study treatment (DCVax-L) and placebo (PBMC) were prepared by Cognate BioServices, Inc. for all patients in the US and Canada, and by Cognate and the Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy together for patients in Europe, during the chemoradiotherapy period before the baseline visit. The production of DCVax-L involved processing the resected tumor tissue into a lysate, and then collection, purification, differentiation, activation and loading of the autologous DCs. In general, approximately 2 g of tumor tissue was needed to produce the full ten doses for the 36-month treatment and followup schedule. The vaccine was aliquoted in individual doses and cryopreserved at &lt; 150 °C [22]. The doses were stored centrally, and shipped individually to the clinical trial sites.Both the study treatment (DCVax-L) and placebo (PBMC) were prepared by Cognate BioServices, Inc. for all patients in the US and Canada, and by Cognate and the Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy together for patients in Europe, during the chemoradiotherapy period before the baseline visit.

        <p>Baseline assessments included physical examination, neurological examination, vitals, KPS, MRI of brain with and without contrast, hematology (CBC with differential, platelets), and serum chemistries (calcium, magnesium, SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase, LDH, total bilirubin, BUN, creatinine, electrolytes, glucose). Blood was collected for serum markers of autoimmune disease (anti-DNA) and immune monitoring, at the baseline visit and at treatment visits throughout the trial. MRI brain scans were performed every 2 months, per SOC, after the baseline MRI until radiological tumor progression. All MRI scans were evaluated centrally by 2 blinded independent radiologists, with adjudication by a third such radiologist if needed.Baseline assessments included physical examination, neurological examination, vitals, KPS, MRI of brain with and without contrast, hematology (CBC with differential, platelets), and serum chemistries (calcium, magnesium, SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase, LDH, total bilirubin, BUN, creatinine, electrolytes, glucose).

        <p>The DCVax-L treatment was well tolerated, with only 7 ITT patients (2.1%) experiencing serious (NCI CTC Grades 3-4) adverse events that were deemed related or possibly related to the DCVax-L treatment.

        <p>Although enrollment was completed in 2015, this trial, including both treatments and follow-up, is still ongoing and will remain blinded until sufficient events of disease progression and/or death have occurred to more fully elucidate the tail of the survival curve. To date, due to the crossover design, nearly 90% of the ITT population received DCVax-L at some point in the trial, due to the crossover design.Although enrollment was completed in 2015, this trial, including both treatments and follow-up, is still ongoing and will remain blinded until sufficient events of disease progression and/or death have occurred to more fully elucidate the tail of the survival curve.

        <p>In the overall ITT population in this trial, the mOS of 23.1 months from surgery compares favorably with the mOS of 15-17 months from surgery typically achieved with SOC in past studies and clinical practice, as well as with the survival data with SOC treatment in the control arms of other trials in similar patient populations. For example, Weller et al. reported mOS of 17.4 months from randomization in the ITT population [21], and Stupp et al. reported mOS of 16.0 months from randomization in the ITT population [24].In the overall ITT population in this trial, the mOS of 23.1 months from surgery compares favorably with the mOS of 15-17 months from surgery typically achieved with SOC in past studies and clinical practice, as well as with the survival data with SOC treatment in the control arms of other trials in similar patient populations.

        <p>In patients with a methylated MGMT gene promoter, the mOS of 34.7 months from surgery also compares favorably with SOC in past studies as well as with the mOS reported for the control arm SOC treatments in other recent glioblastoma trials in similar patient populations. For example, Stupp et al. reported for their control group an mOS of 21.2 months from randomization in a similar patient population [24]. The increase in survival in MGMT-methylated patients in the DCVax-L trial raises the possibility of a cooperative effect from the combination of temozolomide chemotherapy and the DCVax-L active immune therapy [17].In patients with a methylated MGMT gene promoter, the mOS of 34.7 months from surgery also compares favorably with SOC in past studies as well as with the mOS reported for the control arm SOC treatments in other recent glioblastoma trials in similar patient populations.

        <p>The mutation status of the IDH1 gene has not yet been investigated for this trial, as this factor was not included in trial designs a decade ago when this trial began. It will be collected and analyzed later, but is unlikely to explain the overall survival results, as the mutation associated with prolonged survival occurs in less than 10% of newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients [27].The mutation status of the IDH1 gene has not yet been investigated for this trial, as this factor was not included in trial designs a decade ago when this trial began.

        <p>Beneficial effects of immune therapies are often observed at later time points, in the tail of the survival curve [26]. Although this Phase 3 trial requires further maturation, a picture is beginning to emerge from the blinded interim data which is consistent with an extended survival tail. For example, among the patients (n = 182) who were ≥ 36 months past their surgery date as of the date of this analysis, 24.2% (n = 44) were alive for ≥ 36 months and have a KM estimated median survival time of 88.2 months. Thus, it appears that patients who survive past certain threshold time points may continue onwards to unusually long survival times, similar to the findings in our prior Phase I/II studies of this DCbased vaccine [17][18][19]. Further maturation of the trial data is needed to more fully reveal the extent of the long tail of the survival curve.Beneficial effects of immune therapies are often observed at later time points, in the tail of the survival curve [26].

        <p>DCVax-L has shown a benign safety profile in this Phase 3 study, as it has consistently done in prior early stage trials [17,19], and in a large group of patients treated on a compassionate use basis [28]. The fact that only 7 of the 331 ITT patients (2.1%) experienced any grade 3 or 4 adverse events that were at least possibly related to the treatment makes this DC vaccine an especially well tolerated treatment.DCVax-L has shown a benign safety profile in this Phase 3 study, as it has consistently done in prior early stage trials [17,19], and in a large group of patients treated on a compassionate use basis [28].

        <p>With such a safety profile, this DC vaccine may be administered in a wide range of clinical settings, and can potentially be combined with a wide range of other treatment agents, including immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies, without resulting in undue toxicities for patients such as have been seen with some other treatment combinations [29,30]. Further studies to explore such combinations are warranted.With such a safety profile, this DC vaccine may be administered in a wide range of clinical settings, and can potentially be combined with a wide range of other treatment agents, including immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies, without resulting in undue toxicities for patients such as have been seen with some other treatment combinations [29,30].
