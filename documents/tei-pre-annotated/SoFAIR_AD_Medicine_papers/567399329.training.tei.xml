        <p>In writing a consensus document, it is recognized that consensus does not mean that there was complete agreement among all the writing group members. Surveys of the entire writing group were used to identify areas of consensus concerning performance of AF ablation procedures and to develop recommendations concerning the indications for catheter and surgical AF ablation. These recommendations were systematically balloted by the 60 writing group members and were approved by a minimum of 80% of these members. The recommendations were also subject to a 1-month public comment period. Each partnering and collaborating organization then officially reviewed, commented on, edited, and endorsed the final document and recommendations.In writing a consensus document, it is recognized that consensus does not mean that there was complete agreement among all the writing group members.

        <p>The grading system for indication of class of evidence level was adapted based on that used by the ACC and the AHA. 3,4 It is important to state, however, that this document is not a guideline. The indications for catheter and surgical ablation of AF, as well as recommendations for procedure performance, are presented with a Class and Level of Evidence (LOE) to be consistent with what the reader is familiar with seeing in guideline statements. A Class I recommendation means that the benefits of the AF ablation procedure markedly exceed the risks, and that AF ablation should be performed; a Class IIa recommendation means that the benefits of an AF ablation procedure exceed the risks, and that it is reasonable to perform AF ablation; a Class IIb recommendation means that the benefit of AF ablation is greater or equal to the risks, and that AF ablation may be considered; and a Class III recommendation means that AF ablation is of no proven benefit and is not recommended.The grading system for indication of class of evidence level was adapted based on that used by the ACC and the AHA. 3,4 It is important to state, however, that this document is not a guideline.

        <p>Management of patients with AF has traditionally consisted of three main components: (1) anticoagulation for stroke prevention; (2) rate control; and (3) rhythm control. With the emergence of large amounts of data, which have both defined and called attention to the interaction between modifiable risk factors and the development of AF and outcomes of AF management, we believe it is time to include risk factor modification as the fourth pillar of AF management. This section of the document reviews the link between modifiable risk factors and both the development of AF and their impacts on the outcomes of AF ablation.Management of patients with AF has traditionally consisted of three main components: (1) anticoagulation for stroke prevention; (2) rate control; and (3) rhythm control.

        <p>Shown in Table 2, and summarized in Figures 7 and8 of this document, are the Consensus Indications for Catheter and Surgical Ablation of AF. As outlined in the introduction section of this document, these indications are stratified as Class I, Class IIa, Class IIb, and Class III indications. The evidence supporting these indications is provided, as well as a selection of the key references supporting these levels of evidence. In making these recommendations, the writing group considered the body of published literature that has defined the safety and efficacy of catheter and surgical ablation of AF. Also considered in these recommendations is the personal lifetime experience in the field of each of the writing group members. Both the number of clinical trials and the quality of these trials were considered. In considering the class of indications recommended by this writing group, it is important to keep several points in mind. First, these classes of indications only define the indications for catheter and surgical ablation of AF when performed by an electrophysiologist or a surgeon who has received appropriate training and/or who has a certain level of experience and is performing the procedure in an experienced center (Section 11). Catheter and surgical ablation of AF are highly complex procedures, and a careful assessment of the benefit and risk must be considered for each patient. Second, these indications stratify patients based only on the type of AF and whether the procedure is being performed prior to or following a trial of one or more Class I or III antiarrhythmic medications. This document for the first time includes indications for catheter ablation of select asymptomatic patients. As detailed in Section 9, there are many other additional clinical and imaging-based variables that can be used to further define the efficacy and risk of ablation in a given patient. Some of the variables that can be used to define patients in whom a lower success rate or a higher complication rate can be expected include the presence of concomitant heart disease, obesity, sleep apnea, left atrial (LA) size, patient age and frailty, as well as the duration of time the patient has been in continuous AF. Each of these variables needs to be considered when discussing the risks and benefits of AF ablation with a particular patient. In the presence of substantial risk or anticipated difficulty of ablation, it could be more appropriate to use additional antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) options, even if the patient on face value might present with a Class I or IIa indication for ablation. Third, it is important to consider patient preference and values. Some patients are reluctant to consider a major procedure or surgery and have a strong preference for a pharmacological approach. In these patients, trials of antiarrhythmic agents including amiodarone might be preferred to catheter ablation. On the other hand, some patients prefer a nonpharmacological approach. Fourth, it is important to recognize that some patients early in the course of their AF journey might have only infrequent episodes for many years and/or could have AF that is responsive to well-tolerated AAD therapy. And finally, it is important to bear in mind that a decision to perform catheter or surgical AF ablation should only be made after a patient carefully considers the risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure.Shown in Table 2, and summarized in Figures 7 and8 of this document, are the Consensus Indications for Catheter and Surgical Ablation of AF.

        <p>This section of the consensus statement provides an update on many of the technologies and tools that are employed for AF ablation procedures. It is important to recognize that this is not a comprehensive listing and that new technologies, tools, and approaches are being developed. It is also important to recognize that radiofrequency (RF) energy is the dominant energy source available for ablation of typical and atypical atrial flutter (AFL). Although cryoablation is a commonly employed tool for AF ablation, it is not well suited for ablation of typical or atypical AFL. Other energy sources and tools are available in some parts of the world and/or are in various stages of development and/or clinical investigation. Shown in Figure 9 are schematic drawings of AF ablation using point-by-point RF energy (Figure 9A) and AF ablation using the cryoballoon (CB) system (Figure 9B). A decision to perform AF ablation in an asymptomatic patient requires additional discussion with the patient because the potential benefits of the procedure for the patient without symptoms are uncertain.This section of the consensus statement provides an update on many of the technologies and tools that are employed for AF ablation procedures.

        <p>AF ablation is an invasive procedure that entails risks, most of which are present during the acute procedural period. However, complications can also occur in the weeks or months following ablation. Recognizing common symptoms after AF ablation and distinguishing those that require urgent evaluation and referral to an electrophysiologist is an important part of follow-up after AF ablation. The success of AF ablation is based in large part on freedom from AF The usefulness of ablation of complex fractionated atrial electrograms as an initial or repeat ablation strategy for persistent and long-standing persistent AF is not well established.AF ablation is an invasive procedure that entails risks, most of which are present during the acute procedural period.

        <p>The universal definition of myocardial infarction 395 cannot be applied in the context of catheter or surgical AF ablation procedures because it relies heavily on cardiac biomarkers (troponin and CPK), which are anticipated to increase in all patients who undergo AF ablation as a result of the ablation of myocardial tissue. Similarly, chest pain and other cardiac symptoms are difficult to interpret in the context of AF ablation both because of the required sedation and anesthesia and also because most patients experience chest pain following the procedure as a result of the associated pericarditis that occurs following catheter ablation. We therefore propose that a myocardial infarction, in the context of catheter or surgical ablation, be defined as the presence of any one of the following criteria: (1) detection of ECG changes indicative of new ischemia (new ST-T wave changes or new LBBB) that persist for more than 1 hour;The universal definition of myocardial infarction 395 cannot be applied in the context of catheter or surgical AF ablation procedures because it relies heavily on cardiac biomarkers (troponin and CPK), which are anticipated to increase in all patients who undergo AF ablation as a result of the ablation of myocardial tissue.

        <p>Catheter ablation of AF is one of the most complex interventional electrophysiological procedures. AF ablation by its nature involves catheter manipulation and ablation in the delicate thin-walled atria, which are in close proximity to other important organs and structures that can be impacted through collateral damage. It is therefore not surprising that AF ablation is associated with a significant risk of complications, some of which might result in life-long disability and/ or death. This section reviews the complications associated with catheter ablation procedures performed to treat AF. The types and incidence of complications are presented, their mechanisms are explored, and the optimal approach to prevention and treatment is discussed (Tables 8 and9). Typically, this would apply to substrate ablation performed in addition to PVI for persistent AF. Although some have proposed AF termination as a surrogate for acute procedural success, its relationship to long-term success is controversial. Complete elimination of the additional substrate (localized rotational activation, scar region, non-PV trigger, or other target) and/or demonstration of bidirectional conduction block across a linear ablation lesion would typically be considered the appropriate endpoint.Catheter ablation of AF is one of the most complex interventional electrophysiological procedures.

        <p>One-year success* One-year success is defined as freedom from AF/AFL/AT after removal from antiarrhythmic drug therapy as assessed from the end of the 3month blanking period to 12 months following the ablation procedure. Because cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent atrial flutter is easily treated with cavotricuspid isthmus ablation and is not an iatrogenic arrhythmia following a left atrial ablation procedure for AF, it is reasonable for clinical trials to choose to prespecify that occurrence of isthmus-dependent atrial flutter, if confirmed by entrainment maneuvers during electrophysiology testing, should not be considered an ablation failure or primary effectiveness endpoint.One-year success* One-year success is defined as freedom from AF/AFL/AT after removal from antiarrhythmic drug therapy as assessed from the end of the 3month blanking period to 12 months following the ablation procedure.

        <p>Alternative one-year success Although the one-year success definition provided above remains the recommended end point that should be reported in all AF ablation trials, and the endpoint for which the objective performance criteria listed below were developed, the Task Force recognizes that alternative definitions for success can be used if the main goal of therapy in the study is to relieve AF-related symptoms and to improve patient QOL. In particular, it is appropriate for clinical trials to define success as freedom from only symptomatic AF/AFL/AT after removal from antiarrhythmic drug therapy as assessed from the end of the 3-month blanking period to 12 months following the ablation procedure if the main goal of therapy in the study is to relieve AF-related symptoms and to improve patient QOL. However, because symptoms of AF can resolve over time, and because studies have shown that asymptomatic AF represents a greater proportion of all AF postablation than prior to ablation, clinical trials need to continue to report freedom from both symptomatic and asymptomatic AF even if this alternative one year success definition is used as the primary trial endpoint. Clinical/partial success* It is reasonable for clinical trials to define and incorporate one or more secondary definitions of success that can be referred to as "clinical success" or "partial success." If these alternative definitions of success are included, they should be defined prospectively. In prior Consensus Documents the Task Force has proposed that clinical/partial success be defined as a "75% or greater reduction in the number of AF episodes, the duration of AF episodes, or the % time a patient is in AF as assessed with a device capable of measuring AF burden in the presence or absence of previously ineffective antiarrhythmic drug therapy." Because there is no firm scientific basis for selecting the cutoff of 75% rather than a different cutoff, this prior recommendation is provided only as an example of what future clinical trials may choose to use as a definition of clinical/partial success.Alternative one-year success Although the one-year success definition provided above remains the recommended end point that should be reported in all AF ablation trials, and the endpoint for which the objective performance criteria listed below were developed, the Task Force recognizes that alternative definitions for success can be used if the main goal of therapy in the study is to relieve AF-related symptoms and to improve patient QOL.

        <p>A risk-based approach to determine the level of postablation stroke screening in clinical trials is recommended by the Task Force. For ablation devices with a lower risk of stroke and for which a stroke signal has not been reported, a minimum standardized neurological assessment of stroke should be conducted by a physician at baseline and at hospital discharge or 24 hours after the procedure, whichever is later. If this neurological assessment demonstrates new abnormal findings, the patient should have a formal neurological consult and examination with appropriate imaging (i.e., DW-MRI), used to confirm any suspected diagnosis of stroke. For devices in which a higher risk of stroke is suspected or revealed in prior trials, a formal neurological examination by a neurologist at discharge or 24 hours after the procedure, whichever is later, is recommended. Appropriate imaging should be obtained if this evaluation reveals a new neurological finding. In some studies in which delayed stroke is a concern, repeat neurological screening at 30 days postablation might be appropriate. Detectable AF/AFL/AT Detectable AF is defined as AF/AFL/AT of at least 30 seconds' duration when assessed with ECG monitoring. If other monitoring systems are used, including implantable pacemakers, implantable defibrillators, and subcutaneous ECG monitoring devices, the definition of detectable AF needs to be prespecified in the clinical trial based on the sensitivity and specificity of AF detection with the particular device.

When staged, it is most typical to have the patient undergo the minimally invasive surgical ablation procedure first following by a catheter ablation procedure 1 to 3 months later. This latter approach is referred to as a "staged Hybrid AF ablation procedure." Symptomatic AF/AFL/AT AF/AFL/AT that results in symptoms that are experienced by the patient. These symptoms can include but are not limited to palpitations, presyncope, syncope, fatigue, and shortness of breath. For patients in continuous AF, reassessment of symptoms after restoration of sinus rhythm is recommended to establish the relationship between symptoms and AF. Documentation of AFrelated symptoms Documentation by a physician evaluating the patient that the patient experiences symptoms that could be attributable to AF. This does not require a time-stamped ECG, Holter, or event monitor at the precise time of symptoms. For patients with persistent AF who initially report no symptoms, it is reasonable to reassess symptom status after restoration of sinus rhythm with cardioversion.</p>

        <p>Although there have been many advances made in the field of catheter and surgical ablation of AF, there is still much to be learned about the mechanisms of initiation and maintenance of AF and how to apply this knowledge to the still-evolving techniques of AF ablation. Although single-center, observational reports have dominated the early days of this field, we are quickly moving into an era in which hypotheses are put through the rigor of testing in well-designed, randomized, multicenter clinical trials. It is as a result of these trials that conventional thinking about the best techniques, success rates, complication rates, and long-term outcomes beyond AF recurrence-such as thromboembolism and mortality-is being put to the test. The ablation literature has also seen a proliferation of meta-analyses and other aggregate analyses, which reinforce the need for consistency in the approach to reporting the results of clinical trials. This section reviews the minimum requirements for reporting on AF ablation trials. It also acknowledges the potential limitations of using specific primary outcomes and emphasizes the need for broad and consistent reporting of secondary outcomes to assist the end-user in determining not only the scientific, but also the clinical relevance of the results (Tables 10111213).Although there have been many advances made in the field of catheter and surgical ablation of AF, there is still much to be learned about the mechanisms of initiation and maintenance of AF and how to apply this knowledge to the still-evolving techniques of AF ablation.

The following are unanswered questions for future investigation:</p>
        <p>(1) AF ablation and modification of stroke risk and need for ongoing oral anticoagulation (OAC): The CHA 6) Surgical vs catheter-based vs hybrid ablation: There should be more comparative work between percutaneous and minimally invasive surgical approaches. Both report similar outcomes, but there is a dearth of comparative data. Is there any patient benefit to hybrid procedures? (7) How do we characterize patients who are optimal candidates for ablation? Preablation late gadolinium-enhanced (LGE)-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might identify patients with heavy burdens of scar who are unlikely to respond to ablation. These techniques must become reproducible and reliable and must be assessed in multicenter trials. Other markers need to be investigated, including genetic markers, biochemical markers, and clinical markers based on aggregated risk scores. (8) The incremental role of new technologies: As newer and often more expensive technologies are produced for AF ablation, their definitive incremental value must be determined in order to justify change in practice or case cost. These technologies include global (basket) mapping techniques, newer ablation indices for assessing lesion durability, advanced imaging for viewing lesions in the myocardium, etc. New energy sources, including laser, low-intensity ultrasound, photonic particle therapy, external beam ablation, and MRI-guided ablation, must be assessed in comparative fashion. (9) Outcomes of AF ablation: We need to better understand the clinical relevance of ablation outcomes. What is the significance of time to recurrence of 30 seconds of arrhythmia? How do we best quantify AF burden? How do these outcomes relate to quality of life and stroke risk? (10) What is the role of surgical LA reduction? Does left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion or obliteration improve outcome of persistent AF ablation with an accompanying reduction in stroke? Does ablation work through atrial size reduction? What is the incidence of "stiff atrial" syndrome and does this mitigate the clinical impact of ablation? (11) Working in teams: What is the role of the entire heart team in AF ablation? Does a team approach achieve better outcomes than a "silo" approach? shorter version of the SF-36, which uses just 12 questions and still provides scores that can be compared with SF-36 norms, especially for summary physical and mental functioning.
