        <p>The purpose of this review is to assess the most recent evidence in the management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and provide updated recommendations for its evaluation, diagnosis and treatment. A Medline search of "Hyperparathyroidism. Primary" was conducted and the literature with the highest levels of evidence were reviewed and used to formulate recommendations. PHPT is a common endocrine disorder usually discovered by routine biochemical screening. PHPT is defined as hypercalcemia with increased or inappropriately normal plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH). It is most commonly seen after the age of 50 years, with women predominating by three to fourfold. In countries with routine multichannel screening, PHPT is * A. A.

        <p>Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) has evolved in its clinical presentation over the past 40 years and is now usually diagnosed at an asymptomatic stage [1]. Parathyroidectomy (PTx) is the only curative approach to this disease. It is indicated in those with symptomatic PHPT and advised for those who meet the surgical guideline criteria. It is also a reasonable option among those who request surgery, even if they do not meet surgical guidelines and have no contraindications [2]. Advances in medical management have also taken place over the past decade. For individuals in whom surgery is not possible or desirable, valuable approaches for skeletal protection and lowering of serum calcium have become available [3].Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) has evolved in its clinical presentation over the past 40 years and is now usually diagnosed at an asymptomatic stage [1].

        <p>In this Canadian position paper, we update our previously published guidelines on PHPT with international consensus [4]. Canadian participation was invited at the Fourth International Workshop held in Florence Italy 2013. Canadian representatives met international colleagues in Florence and developed key questions addressing evaluation, imaging, diagnosis, and management of PHPT. Canadian representatives collaborated with international colleagues and formalized evidence-based recommendations to each of the key questions listed. A detailed section on parathyroid imaging was developed as this was highlighted as a need by Canadian endocrinologists. This position paper was supported and endorsed by Canadian Endocrine Update, McMaster University, and Western University. We summarize recent evidence and provide recommendations pertaining to the evaluation, diagnosis, presentation, and management of PHPT.In this Canadian position paper, we update our previously published guidelines on PHPT with international consensus [4].

        <p>We searched Medline from April 15, 2010, to June 14, 2016, using the MeSH search term BHyperparathyroidism, Primary[ Mesh], excluding reviews, letters, and editorials and specifying only English language papers dealing with humans. Of the 728 citations that were obtained, we included those articles with the highest levels of evidence available, as well as those reflective of international consensus. Papers identified by content experts (senior authors AK, DH) as being essential for enhanced understanding, but published before the search period, were also included as decided by expert opinion. Not all articles are included in this review due to the limit on the number of references; however, articles with the highest level of evidence are included as well as key consensus papers.We searched Medline from April 15, 2010, to June 14, 2016, using the MeSH search term BHyperparathyroidism, Primary[ Mesh], excluding reviews, letters, and editorials and specifying only English language papers dealing with humans.

        <p>Five prospective studies, four of which were randomized control trials and one long-term observational study, evaluated the effect of PTx on the skeletal and renal manifestations of PHPT [5][6][7][8][9]. PTx is associated with significant improvements in bone mineral density (BMD). Without surgical intervention, BMD is stable or decreases with long-term follow-up [5][6][7][8]. Data from a 5-year randomized controlled study demonstrated a lower rate of vertebral fracture post-PTx (0 vs 5 fractures) in comparison to no surgery [9]. The difference in the frequency of the fractures between observation and PTx was not statistically significant (p = 0.058); however, it is suggestive of skeletal protection with PTx. Observation may also be safe as the overall frequency of fracture was low. The individuals with fracture had similar age, BMD, and laboratory profile to the remaining study group subjects suggesting that BMD may not be as predictive of future fracture risk in PHPT patients as compared to patients without PHPT. The longest natural history study with 15 years of follow-up enrolled 121 patients, of whom 85 % were asymptomatic, 51 % had PTx during follow-up, and 49 % were followed without surgery [8]. BMD was stable during the first 8 years in those who did not receive PTx and subsequently declined at the femoral neck and distal onethird radius (mean losses of 10 and 35 %, respectively). This study has several limitations including the fact that only six patients with long-term follow-up demonstrated progressive decreases in BMD between year 10 and 15. However, the eventual decline in BMD following a long period of stability suggests that long-term monitoring is essential in those who do not undergo PTx.Five prospective studies, four of which were randomized control trials and one long-term observational study, evaluated the effect of PTx on the skeletal and renal manifestations of PHPT [5][6][7][8][9].

        <p>Classically, PHPT targets the kidney and the skeleton. The extent to which a patient will present with overt involvement of these target organs varies depending on the availability of multichannel screening in a given country.

        <p>Radiographic signs of the PHPT include a salt-and-pepper pattern skull demineralization, distal clavicle tapering, subperiosteal bone resorption, cysts, and brown tumors. Together, these features are described as osteitis fibrosa cystica and are rarely seen in developed countries where more subtle forms of skeletal involvement are observed. Low BMD is especially prevalent at sites with high proportions of cortical bone, such as the distal one-third radius [14]. The lumbar spine BMD appears to be relatively well preserved in PHPT [15].Radiographic signs of the PHPT include a salt-and-pepper pattern skull demineralization, distal clavicle tapering, subperiosteal bone resorption, cysts, and brown tumors.

        <p>Epidemiological studies of patients with PHPT report increases in fracture risk at all skeletal sites [17,19]. Further, high-resolution peripheral quantitative tomography has shown that both trabecular and cortical bone compartments are affected in patients with PHPT [20,21]. HRpQCT indices correlate with fracture prevalence in PHPT, and this correlation is independent of BMD as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptio m e t r y ( D X A ) [ 2 0 ] .

        <p>Renal stones are a major complication of PHPT [1]. In Western countries, the prevalence of clinically overt stone disease has decreased from approximately 80 % of patients in earlier series to 7-20 % presently [1]. However, in systematically screened patients the diagnostic prevalence may be higher (25-55 %) [27]. Generally, patients with PHPT who develop renal stones are younger and more often male [1].Renal stones are a major complication of PHPT [1].

        <p>The relationship between nephrolithiasis and PHPT is not well understood at this time. It appears that 24-h urine calcium is higher in stone formers with PHPT in comparison to nonstone formers with PHPT [28][29][30]. However, this has not been observed consistently [31][32][33] and requires further prospective evaluation. Following PTX, the risk of renal stones is lowered and the presence of marked hypercalciuria is therefore included as a guideline for surgery.The relationship between nephrolithiasis and PHPT is not well understood at this time.

        <p>The pathogenesis of increased renal stone formation in PHPT has not yet been fully elucidated. Hypercalciuria by itself does not fully explain the increased risk, and only limited data is currently available on the potential impact of other biochemical abnormalities, such as renal acidification abnormalities on the risk of stones in PHPT [10,34]. There is no reliable data available on the feasibility of performing metabolic evaluation of stone formers with PHPT, but due to a persistent increased risk after surgical cure of PHPT, it is reasonable to consider screening for other common causes for kidney stones. This includes measurements of serum uric acid and urinary pH as well as assessment of urine volume and the presence of hyperuricosuria, hypomagnesiuria, hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia, or cystinuria [35]. The effect of renal function on PTH secretion has been extensively evaluated [36,37]. Reductions in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are inversely correlated with serum intact PTH [38]. Decreases in renal function (GFR &lt;70 vs &gt;70 mL/min) have been associated with more severe impact on bone strength with greater reductions in BMD particularly at cortical skeletal sites in individuals with PHPT [39]. These data support the recommendations for parathyroidectomy in those with GFR of &lt;60 mL/min. Successful PTx appears to prevent decline in renal function in those with chronic kidney disease (eGFR &lt;60 mL/min) as observed in a recent retrospective crosssectional study in 109 consecutive PHPT patients evaluated before and after PTx [13].

PHPT appears to be associated with an increased risk of developing left ventricular hypertrophy, impaired diastolic filling, and myocardial calcification [42][43][44]. Yu et al. [45] observed in a retrospective population-based study in Tayside, Scotland, that mild PHPT (calcium &lt;2.9 mmol/L) also was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease in comparison to the age-and sex-matched general population and that this increase in mortality was similar to those with symptomatic or severe disease.Severe PHPT characterized by higher serum calcium levels (calcium ≥11.2 mg/dl) has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality [41].

In this study, vitamin D levels were not completed and vitamin D inadequacy may have contributed to elevations in PTH and also impacted mortality.Further, Yu et al.

        <p>The combination of hypercalcemia and an elevated or inappropriately normal parathyroid hormone (PTH) level makes PHPT the most likely diagnosis [69] (please see Fig. 1, normal sigmoidal relationship between calcium and PTH). Measured total serum calcium should be adjusted for albumin [69]. If the corrected serum calcium is normal and PTH is elevated, serum ionized calcium should be measured, as PHPT can present with an elevated ionized calcium despite a normal albuminadjusted serum calcium [69]. Ionized calcium measurements are reliable if samples are collected under anaerobic conditions maintaining the original pH of the specimen, as acidosis is associated with an increase in ionized calcium. The specimen should be stored or centrifuged at 4 °C for up to 2 h, as longer time periods can result in changes in Ca 2+ concentration. The ionized calcium result can be corrected mathematically for changes in pH due to exposure of the specimen to air; however, this will only be an approximation of the true anaerobic ionized calcium [70]. The differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia includes conditions which mimic PHPT, including familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) and certain medication use, such as hydrochlorothiazide or lithium [69]. Both second-and third-generation PTH assays are of value in diagnosing PHPT and provide comparable results [71].The combination of hypercalcemia and an elevated or inappropriately normal parathyroid hormone (PTH) level makes PHPT the most likely diagnosis [69] (please see Fig. 1, normal sigmoidal relationship between calcium and PTH).

        <p>NPHPT has been increasingly recognized over the past decade [1], typically following PTH measurement for assessment for secondary osteoporosis. An elevated serum PTH in the presence of consistently normal albumin-adjusted calcium and ionized calcium, normal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD &gt;20 ng/mL or 50 nmol/L), and well-maintained renal function (eGFR &gt;60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) supports this diagnosis [69]. Other secondary causes for an elevated PTH should be excluded, such as primary hypercalciuria, malabsorption syndromes, use of loop diuretics, bisphosphonates, or denosumab therapy [1]. Over time, NPHPT may progress to classical PHPT with its complications [72].NPHPT has been increasingly recognized over the past decade [1], typically following PTH measurement for assessment for secondary osteoporosis.

        <p>In the evaluation of PHPT, the calcium to creatinine clearance ratio is completed in order to exclude FHH, a rare, autosomal-dominant disorder with three identified variants [73]. It usually presents with very low urinary calcium excretion and mild hypercalcemia with normal or slightly elevated PTH levels [74]. The most common variant, FHH1, is due to an inactivating mutation of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) gene [69]. FHH2 is caused by inactivating mutations of the G-protein alpha 11 subunit (Gα11) [73], and FHH3 is due to inactivating mutations of the adaptor protein 2 sigma subunit (AP2S1) [75]. DNA sequencing can confirm the presence of CaSR, Gα11, or AP2S1 gene mutations and is advised in the following patients [73]: history of unsuccessful parathyroid surgery, age of onset of hypercalcemia under 30 years in the patient or relative, family history of hypercalcemia, or hypercalcemia and inappropriately high-normal or elevated PTH and calcium to creatinine clearance ratio (CaCrCR) &lt;0.02.In the evaluation of PHPT, the calcium to creatinine clearance ratio is completed in order to exclude FHH, a rare, autosomal-dominant disorder with three identified variants [73]. It usually presents with very low urinary calcium excretion and mild hypercalcemia with normal or slightly elevated PTH levels [74].

        <p>A low CaCrCR may be observed in PHPT with renal insufficiency or severe calcium and/or vitamin D deficiency. Racial differences also impact the laboratory profile. In those of African descent, the prevalence of low urine calcium excretion in patients with PHPT is very high, with approximately 44 % of patients presenting with calcium excretion of ≤100 mg/day in one study [74]. Patients with FHH should not undergo PTx, as the CaSR defect remains in the kidney and remaining parathyroid tissue, resulting in persistent hypercalcemia [74]. Mutations of the CaSR gene affecting both alleles can cause parathyroid hyperplasia with severe hypercalcemia and other classical features of PHPT [74,76].

Physiologic uptake is also observed in the thyroid gland, the salivary glands, thymus (in young individuals), liver, mammary glands (during lactation), bone marrow, and brown adipose tissue. 99m Tc-sestamibi scintigraphy is very sensitive (90 %) and highly accurate (97.2 %) in PHPT [78], with greater experience resulting in more reliable results [79]. Larger parathyroid adenoma (&gt;1.8 cm) and higher preoperative ionized calcium levels (&gt;1.49 mmol/L) are more reliably identified by sestamibi scan [78].

If the PTH level decreases by at least 50 % and falls into the normal range following resection, this confirms that adequate tissue has been resected and further exploration is not necessary [94].Measuring PTH intraoperatively (IOPTH) with a rapid assay is of value in confirming adequate resection of abnormal parathyroid tissue and increases surgical success rates [94,103].

        <p>Repeat surgery is necessary in up to 5 % of individuals with persistent PHPT defined as the development of hypercalcemia within 6 months of PTx and is due to incomplete resection of abnormal parathyroid tissue. Recurrent disease as compared to persistent disease reflects the development of PHPT anew and occurs in up to 8 % of individuals with a sporadic parathyroid adenoma after 3-11 years [94]. Patients with double parathyroid adenomas have a higher rate of recurrent PHPT (4.0 %) as compared to patients with a single adenoma (1.3 %) or hyperplasia (2.2 %) [94]. Localization studies should be performed before reoperations to identify ectopic glands, although in most cases the abnormal glands are located in eutopic positions. The reoperation is best planned as a focused intervention when the presumed tumor is localized or as a unilateral exploration on the side that has not been explored previously [94]. Employment of an IOPTH assay is very helpful in remedial cases. Reoperation has a high success rate (&gt;90 %) [94], especially when the pathologic parathyroid tissue is localized preoperatively. However, the risk of complications is higher in connection with a reoperation [94]. Cryopreservation of removed parathyroid tissue should be considered and used for subsequent auto-transplantation when permanent postoperative hypoparathyroidism is a real consideration. The success of PTx is influenced by patient age, surgeon's expertise, and hospital endocrine surgery volume, as well as the results of preoperative imaging [94].Repeat surgery is necessary in up to 5 % of individuals with persistent PHPT defined as the development of hypercalcemia within 6 months of PTx and is due to incomplete resection of abnormal parathyroid tissue.

        <p>As there is a 1000:1-M ratio between serum 25OHD and serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH) 2 D), it is unlikely that PTH-stimulated conversion of 25OHD to 1,25(OH) 2 D explains the reduction in serum 25OHD in PHPT. It is probable that elevated 1,25(OH) 2 D levels stimulate 24hydroxylase gene expression and enhanced conversion of 25OHD to 1,24-dihydroxy vitamin D [106]. Co-existing vitamin D insufficiency has been associated with increased parathyroid gland weight; higher plasma levels of PTH, calcium, and alkaline phosphatase; lower plasma phosphate levels; and lower total hip and forearm BMD and cortical BMD [107,108].As there is a 1000:1-M ratio between serum 25OHD and serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH) 2 D), it is unlikely that PTH-stimulated conversion of 25OHD to 1,25(OH) 2 D explains the reduction in serum 25OHD in PHPT.

        <p>Vitamin D inadequacy appears to be associated with a more severe bone disease [109] and, consequently, a greater risk of hungry bone syndrome following PTx. In a 1-year study of 21 patients, vitamin D supplementation in PHPT was safe and effective in lowering PTH levels by up to 26 % without increasing mean serum calcium or urinary calcium excretion, although two patients had urinary calcium excretion above 400 mg [110]. The effects on bone markers and BMD are not conclusive [106]. Occasionally, vitamin D treatment may increase serum calcium levels and renal calcium excretion. A randomized, placebo-controlled study of vitamin D supplementation (2800 IU daily) for 26 weeks prior to PTx showed a significant 17 % decrease in serum PTH and a 2.5 % increase in lumbar BMD in the treated group without side effects [108].Vitamin D inadequacy appears to be associated with a more severe bone disease [109] and, consequently, a greater risk of hungry bone syndrome following PTx.

Hypercalcemia in pregnancy may be masked by several factors including increased extracellular fluid volume, low serum albumin, and increased transport of calcium to the fetus. PHPT in pregnancy has been associated with hyperemesis, miscarriage, nephrolithiasis, life-threatening hypercalcemic crisis, and pancreatitis. PHPT may be associated with intrauterine growth retardation and fetal death, preterm delivery, 1. Imaging is not used for the diagnosis of PHPT, which is based on biochemical profile. 2. Identification of abnormal parathyroid tissue is enhanced with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) study in combination with a computed tomography (CT) study and is particularly valuable in repeat surgical cases. 3.

        <p>PHPT presents at an asymptomatic stage in developed countries, while it remains a symptomatic disease in the developing world, although a larger number of individuals are now presenting with asymptomatic disease in Asia. PTx is curative in experienced hands and remains essential in those with symptomatic disease. In those with asymptomatic disease, surgery is also appropriate, particularly in those who meet surgical guidelines. Cohort data have demonstrated reductions in the risk of all fractures post-PTx. Surgery has also been shown to reduce the risk of renal stones and offers a cure if successful. Similar benefits have not yet been demonstrated with the existing medical options available. Medical monitoring appears to be safe for individuals who do not meet surgical guidelines and is required for those with contraindications for surgery or who are unwilling to undergo surgery. Targeted medical therapy includes amino-bisphosphonates for skeletal protection and cinacalcet for lowering serum calcium. There are no data showing fracture risk reduction with either antiresorptive therapy or with cinacalcet.PHPT presents at an asymptomatic stage in developed countries, while it remains a symptomatic disease in the developing world, although a larger number of individuals are now presenting with asymptomatic disease in Asia.
