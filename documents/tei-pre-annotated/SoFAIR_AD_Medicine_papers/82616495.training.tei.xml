        <p>Macrophages are terminally differentiated cells of the myeloid lineage, with critical functions in tissue development and homeostasis (Okabe and Medzhitov, 2016). These cells serve as a nexus between adaptive and innate immunity, regulating responses to inflammation and wound healing (Mosser and Edwards, 2008). To facilitate these diverse functions, macrophages employ considerable plasticity in response to a range of cytokines. These responses fall within a spectrum of different phenotypes ranging from classically activated pro-inflammatory macrophages to alternatively activated anti-inflammatory macrophages (Xue et al., 2014). Macrophages also possess substantial diversity and plasticity, with recent studies revealing important insights into the developmental origins of tissue-resident macrophages and uncovering tissue-specific gene expression patterns and enhancer landscapes (Gautier et al., 2012;Ginhoux et al., 2010;Gomez Perdiguero et al., 2015;Lavin et al., 2014;Mass et al., 2016).Macrophages are terminally differentiated cells of the myeloid lineage, with critical functions in tissue development and homeostasis (Okabe and Medzhitov, 2016).

        <p>While the local tissue environment sculpts macrophage transcriptional profiles and epigenetic states in homeostasis (Lavin et al., 2014), it is unknown whether an inflammatory tissue environment may promote differences between macrophage populations of distinct ontogenies. This is particularly relevant in cancer, where tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are derived from monocytes and also potentially from tissue-resident macrophages (Du et al., 2008;Pyonteck et al., 2013;Solga et al., 2015).While the local tissue environment sculpts macrophage transcriptional profiles and epigenetic states in homeostasis (Lavin et al., 2014), it is unknown whether an inflammatory tissue environment may promote differences between macrophage populations of distinct ontogenies.

        <p>Brain-resident macrophages, microglia (MG), develop from erythromyeloid precursors in the yolk sac (Gomez Perdiguero et al., 2015;Kierdorf et al., 2013a;Schulz et al., 2012). Unlike other tissue-resident macrophages, during homeostasis, MG undergo self-renewal and their pool is not replenished by monocytes (Ajami et al., 2007). Microglia are also resistant to myeloablative irradiation (Kennedy and Abkowitz, 1997). Indeed, this property has been used extensively in bone marrow transplantation (BMT) models to distinguish radio-resistant MG from BMderived macrophages (BMDMs) (Huang et al., 2014;Sedgwick et al., 1991). However, only under conditions of blood-brain (legend continued on next page) barrier (BBB) disruption (e.g., via irradiation [IR] or chemical manipulation) does there appear to be a significant contribution of BMDMs to the brain macrophage pool in a non-pathological context (Bruttger et al., 2015;Mildner et al., 2007). This is relevant to brain tumors such as gliomas, where there is also disruption of the BBB with disease progression (Dubois et al., 2014). IR-BMT has shown BMDM abundance in murine CNS cancers (Biffi et al., 2004;De Palma et al., 2005;Huang et al., 2014;M€ uller et al., 2015;Pyonteck et al., 2013); however, given the current lack of markers definitively distinguishing MG and BMDMs, it remains unclear if BMDM recruitment indeed occurs in brain tumors in the absence of irradiation. The need for markers distinguishing these cells is especially critical in human disease, where lineage tracing is not possible.Brain-resident macrophages, microglia (MG), develop from erythromyeloid precursors in the yolk sac (Gomez Perdiguero et al., 2015;Kierdorf et al., 2013a;Schulz et al., 2012).

        <p>Here, we utilize multiple genetic lineage tracing models to demonstrate that BMDMs are indeed present in murine brain tumors. Gene expression profiling showed that while BMDMs and MG share features of tumor education, they also exhibit distinct activation modes. Our data suggest these faculties are a result of inherent transcriptional networks poised before the onset of tumorigenesis, where ontogeny pre-biases cells to engage in distinct macrophage activation states. Lastly, we identify markers that distinguish MG and peripherally derived macrophages under homeostasis, as well as in glioma and brain metastasis in both mice and humans.Here, we utilize multiple genetic lineage tracing models to demonstrate that BMDMs are indeed present in murine brain tumors.

        <p>To track the ontogeny of myeloid cells in murine gliomas, we utilized a hematopoietic lineage tracing system, Flt3:Cre; Rosa26:mTmG, which has been used to show that peripheral myeloid cells develop from Flt3 + short-term hematopoietic stem cells (ST-HSCs) and are GFP + , while parenchymal MG develop independently of ST-HSC precursors and are thus negative for the GFP reporter, remaining TdTomato + (Boyer et al., 2011;Gomez Perdiguero et al., 2015). In non-tumorbearing mice, &gt;98% of blood monocytes were GFP + , and &lt;1% of MG showed recombination for the mTmG reporter (Figure 1A). The spleen was composed of GFP + lymphocyte-rich follicles, surrounded by TdTomato + stromal cells, while the brain parenchyma did not contain any detectable GFP + cells (Figure S1A).To track the ontogeny of myeloid cells in murine gliomas, we utilized a hematopoietic lineage tracing system, Flt3:Cre; Rosa26:mTmG, which has been used to show that peripheral myeloid cells develop from Flt3 + short-term hematopoietic stem cells (ST-HSCs) and are GFP + , while parenchymal MG develop independently of ST-HSC precursors and are thus negative for the GFP reporter, remaining TdTomato + (Boyer et al., 2011;Gomez Perdiguero et al., 2015).

        <p>We next bred this line to the nestin:Tva (nTva) line to trace myeloid cell ontogeny in a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of glioma. We induced gliomas by intracranial in-jection of DF1 cells transfected with RCAS vectors encoding platelet-derived growth factor b (PDGFB) and a short hairpin against P53 (Ozawa et al., 2014) (Figure 1A), termed GEMM-shP53 herein. Flow cytometry of end-stage gliomas demonstrated that all monocytes (Cd45 + Cd11b + Ly6C high Ly6G À ) and granulocytes (Cd45 + Cd11b + Ly6C low Ly6G high ) in the tumor were GFP + (Figure 1B), while the bulk TAM compartment (Cd45 + Cd11b + Ly6C À Ly6G À ) was composed of both GFP + TAM BMDMs and GFP À TAM MG (Figures 1A,1B,and S1B), confirmed by tissue immunofluorescence (IF) co-staining with the pan-macrophage marker Iba1 (Figure 1C). By contrast, the contralateral, non-malignant brain contained only GFP À MG, demonstrating the specific abundance of TAM BMDMs only within the tumor mass (Figure 1B).We next bred this line to the nestin:Tva (nTva) line to trace myeloid cell ontogeny in a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of glioma.

        <p>We and others have utilized IR-BMT to show that TAM BMDMs are recruited to murine gliomas (Huang et al., 2014;Pyonteck et al., 2013). However, IR can lead to ectopic recruitment of BMDMs to the brain and thereby increase their relative abundance (M€ uller et al., 2015). We verified these findings in the orthotopic, syngeneic GL261 glioma model and found the TAM compartment was composed of both TAM MG and TAM BMDMs using both IR-BMT lineage tracing and IR-independent Flt3:Cre lineage tracing (Figures S1C and S1D). TAM BMDM abundance was significantly increased in the IR-BMT model compared to the Flt3:Cre model (Figure S1D), reinforcing previous reports that IR-BMT can skew the ratio of MG and BMDMs. Critically, however, using Flt3:Cre lineage tracing, we found that BMDMs composed &gt;35% of the bulk TAM population in gliomas without IR preconditioning, demonstrating that BMDM infiltration into tumors is not solely an artifact of IR (Figure S1D).We and others have utilized IR-BMT to show that TAM BMDMs are recruited to murine gliomas (Huang et al., 2014;Pyonteck et al., 2013).

        <p>To exclude the possibility that this finding was due to a subset of TAM MG spontaneously upregulating Flt3 expression, we utilized a complementary lineage-tracing approach previously indicated to be specific for MG in the normal brain: Cx3cr1:CreER-IRES YFP; Rosa26:lsl-TdTomato (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details) (Parkhurst et al., 2013). 3 days after tamoxifen-induced labeling, &gt;99% of MG and circulating monocytes were TdTomato + (Figure S1E). However, after 3 weeks, blood monocytes no longer retained the TdTomato + reporter, indicating their turnover and replenishment by tamoxifen-''naive'' monocytes (Figure S1E). By contrast, &gt;99% of MG remained TdTomato + (Figure S1E). We induced GL261 tumors in these mice, at 7 weeks of age, and observed both TdTomato + TAM MG and TdTomato À TAM BMDMs (Figures 1D and1E). Meanwhile, all monocytes and granulocytes were TdTomato À in the tumor and periphery (Figure 1E). These findings were substantiated by IF co-staining of tissue (E) Flow cytometry quantitation of TdTomato + and TdTomato À monocytes and granulocytes in peripheral blood, MG in non-tumor-bearing brain, and monocytes, granulocytes, and TAMs in GL261 gliomas as depicted in (D).

Importantly, there was a gradient of eYFP reporter expression levels, with highest expression in TdTomato + TAM MG, slightly lower levels in TdTomato À TAM BMDMs, and lowest levels in monocytes (Figure S1F), demonstrating the capacity of TAM BMDMs to express Cx3cr1 in brain tumors. Thus, Cx3cr1 expression alone cannot be used to strictly identify MG in gliomas. Together, these complementary genetic lineage-tracing models show that BMDMs contribute to the TAM pool in several murine models of glioma, in the absence of IR.To exclude the possibility that this finding was due to a subset of TAM MG spontaneously upregulating Flt3 expression, we utilized a complementary lineage-tracing approach previously indicated to be specific for MG in the normal brain: Cx3cr1:CreER-IRES YFP; Rosa26:lsl-TdTomato (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details) (Parkhurst et al., 2013). 3 days after tamoxifen-induced labeling, &gt;99% of MG and circulating monocytes were TdTomato + (Figure S1E).

        <p>We next analyzed the transcriptional profiles of TAM MG and TAM BMDMs in gliomas. We performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on sorted populations of TAM MG and TAM BMDM from GEMM-shP53 and GL261 tumors using the Flt3-based and Cx3cr1-based lineage tracing systems, respectively. We also collected MG and Ly6C high blood monocytes from nontumor-bearing Flt3:Cre Rosa26:mTmG mice. Global correlation analyses revealed distinct clustering of all TAM populations from normal MG and monocytes, with further cell-type-specific and tumor-specific clustering (Figure 1G). As expected, monocytes were enriched for Ly6c2 expression, while both TAM MG and TAM BMDMs expressed higher levels of macrophage differentiation markers (e.g., Aif1 and Mertk) than monocytes (Figure S1G). Normal MG and TAM MG expressed higher levels of MG-enriched genes (e.g., Cx3cr1, P2ry12, and Tmem119) than monocytes and TAM BMDMs (Figure S1G).We next analyzed the transcriptional profiles of TAM MG and TAM BMDMs in gliomas.

        <p>We next delineated cell-type-specific, tumor-specific, and conserved patterns of tumor education among TAMs (Figure 1H). We identified differentially expressed genes between each TAM population from GEMM-shP53 and GL261 tumors compared to normal MG and monocytes (Figures 1I andS1H; Table S1A). Using normal MG as the reference, we found 91 genes specifically upregulated in TAM MG from both GEMM-shP53 and GL261 models (Figure 1I, red bar), and 342 genes upregulated in TAM BMDMs from both GEMM-shP53 and GL261 models (Figure 1I, green bar). We also identified genes that were specifically upregulated in TAM MG and TAM BMDMs from either the GEMM-shP53 (n = 102) or GL261 (n = 778) models. The largest gene set (n = 1383) was significantly upregulated in all TAM populations compared to normal MG (Figure 1I, orange bar). Similar patterns of expression were observed when monocytes were used as the reference population (Figure S1H; Table S1B).We next delineated cell-type-specific, tumor-specific, and conserved patterns of tumor education among TAMs (Figure 1H). We identified differentially expressed genes between each TAM population from GEMM-shP53 and GL261 tumors compared to normal MG and monocytes (Figures 1I andS1H; Table S1A).

Similar patterns of expression were observed when monocytes were used as the reference population (Figure S1H; Table S1B).</p>
        <p>Many cell-cycle-related genes were upregulated, suggesting increased TAM proliferation compared to normal MG and monocytes (Tables S1A andS1B). Indeed, we found Ki67 + cells in both Iba1 + GFP + TAM BMDM and Iba1 + GFP À TAM MG in the Flt3based lineage-tracing model (Figure 1J). Conserved upregulation of complement-related factors, extracellular matrix components, proteases, lipid metabolism mediators, and clotting factors were also evident in both TAM populations (Table S1A). In addition to these programmatic changes, compared to normal MG, there was upregulation of growth factors (Igf1, Areg, and Osm), chemokines and cytokines (Spp1, Ccl5, Cxcl9, and Cxcl10), and other immune modulators, including Cd274/PD-L1 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC class) I molecules (H2-K1, H2-D1, and B2m) (Table S1A). A similar distribution of differentially ex-pressed genes was evident in comparing the TAM populations from both glioma models to blood monocytes (Figure S1H; Table S1B). Interestingly, we found several MG-enriched genes (e.g., Tmem119, Olfml3, Lag3, Jam2, and Sparc) (Gautier et al., 2012) enriched in TAM BMDMs in both GL261 and GEMM-shP53 models compared to monocytes (Table S1B). Despite this difference, there was still higher expression of MG-related genes in normal MG and TAM MG than in TAM BMDMs. Meanwhile, other MG-enriched genes showed no such induction in TAM BMDMs (P2ry12, Sall1, and Mef2c). Collectively, these data are consistent with Cx3cr1 upregulation specifically in gliomas (Figure S1F) and the notion that macrophages acquire tissue-resident gene expression upon infiltration into a foreign tissue (Gosselin et al., 2014;Lavin et al., 2014).Many cell-cycle-related genes were upregulated, suggesting increased TAM proliferation compared to normal MG and monocytes (Tables S1A andS1B).

        <p>We investigated transcriptional differences between TAMs derived from BMDMs versus MG and identified 378 differentially expressed genes enriched in TAM MG compared to TAM BMDMs in both GEMM-shP53 and GL261 models and 485 genes enriched in TAM BMDMs compared to TAM MG (Figure 2A; Table S2). As expected, among the 378 TAM MG genes, we found markers previously shown to be enriched in MG compared to other macrophage populations, including P2ry12, Tmem119, Slc2a5, Pros1, and Sall1 (Figure 2A) (Gautier et al., 2012). Consistent with their tissue-specific functions, we found that normal MG and TAM MG were enriched for Jam2 and Ocln (Figure S2A; Table S2), integral components of the bloodbrain barrier (Liu et al., 2012). Similarly, TAM MG expressed higher levels of classical complement factors C4b, C2, and Cfh (Figure S2A), a pathway important for MG function in synaptic pruning and host defense (Stephan et al., 2012).We investigated transcriptional differences between TAMs derived from BMDMs versus MG and identified 378 differentially expressed genes enriched in TAM MG compared to TAM BMDMs in both GEMM-shP53 and GL261 models and 485 genes enriched in TAM BMDMs compared to TAM MG (Figure 2A; Table S2).

        <p>Meanwhile, TAM BMDMs expressed high levels of alternative complement cascade components Cfb and Cfp (Figure S2A) and enrichment of many immune effectors, including Cd40, Jak2, Ifitm1, Ifitm2, Tlr11, Tlr5, Tlr8, Mefv, and Fas (Figure S2A). In the GEMM-shP53 model, interleukin 1 (IL-1) pathway ligands were differentially expressed, with Il1a enriched in TAM MG and Il1b in TAM BMDMs, and similar trends were observed in the GL261 model (Figure S2B). While Il1r1 levels did not significantly differ, TAM BMDMs expressed higher levels of the IL-1 signaling antagonist Il1rn, and the IL-1 decoy receptor Il1r2 (Figure S2B). These results complement reports in non-cancer contexts demonstrating Il1a enrichment in MG compared to BMDMs, where IL-1 signaling played a critical role in MG repopulation and maintenance (Bruttger et al., 2015).Meanwhile, TAM BMDMs expressed high levels of alternative complement cascade components Cfb and Cfp (Figure S2A) and enrichment of many immune effectors, including Cd40, Jak2, Ifitm1, Ifitm2, Tlr11, Tlr5, Tlr8, Mefv, and Fas (Figure S2A).

While Il1r1 levels did not significantly differ, TAM BMDMs expressed higher levels of the IL-1 signaling antagonist Il1rn, and the IL-1 decoy receptor Il1r2 (Figure S2B). These results complement reports in non-cancer contexts demonstrating Il1a enrichment in MG compared to BMDMs, where IL-1 signaling played a critical role in MG repopulation and maintenance (Bruttger et al., 2015).</p>
        <p>We next interrogated chemokines, growth factors, and immune modulators associated with different macrophage activation states. In addition to model-specific gene expression changes (Figure S2C; Table S3), we found in both GEMM and GL261 models that TAM BMDMs were enriched for chemokines involved in wound healing, including Ccl22, Ccl17, Cxcl2, Cxcl3, and Cxcl16 (Figure 2B) (Xue et al., 2014). Interestingly, TAM MG were enriched for expression of Ccl4 and Tnf, chemokines associated with a pro-inflammatory response (Xue et al., 2014). This difference in activation states was supported by a programmatic increase in antigen presentation centered on increased expression (F) Boxplot of core BMDM genes (Figure 2E) and core MG genes (Figure S2D), where each data point represents the Z scored expression of a gene across the indicated cell populations using available datasets from the Immunological Genome Project.We next interrogated chemokines, growth factors, and immune modulators associated with different macrophage activation states.

        <p>of the MHC II master regulator Ciita (Reith et al., 2005) and its transcriptional targets H2-Aa, H2-DMb1, H2-Eb1, and Cd74 in TAM BMDMs (Figure 2C). IF staining in Flt3:Cre; GEMM-shP53 tumors revealed a marked increase in MHC II in tumors, compared to adjacent brain, restricted to GFP + TAM BMDMs (Figure 2D). In addition to this antigen-presentation program, costimulatory molecules such as Cd80, Cd40, and Cd200r4 were increased (Figure S2A). These findings were further complemented by TAM BMDM-enriched expression of the Aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr), a transcription factor previously shown to mediate immune suppression (Murray et al., 2014;Opitz et al., 2011) (Figure S2A). Critically, we also found that the immunosuppressive cytokine Il10 was enriched in TAM BMDMs compared to TAM MG (Figure 2B). Collectively, these results suggest that TAM BMDMs engage in a chronic wound-healing-like state reminiscent of an alternatively activated macrophage (Mosser and Edwards, 2008). Similar phenotypes have been shown in models of oligodendrocyte cell death, where, despite high MHC II expression, myeloid cells did not activate a robust T cell response (Locatelli et al., 2012), suggestive of a tolerogenic program.of the MHC II master regulator Ciita (Reith et al., 2005) and its transcriptional targets H2-Aa, H2-DMb1, H2-Eb1, and Cd74 in TAM BMDMs (Figure 2C).

        <p>We next asked if the differences in inflammatory mediators were an inherent feature of BMDMs upon entry into the brain or rather a consequence of tumor education. Previous studies demonstrated that when MG are depleted and the brain preconditioned by IR, BMDMs can seed the brain and contribute significantly to the brain macrophage pool (hereafter termed ''ectopic BMDM'' in a normal ''repopulated brain'') (Bruttger et al., 2015). We used this dataset for comparative analyses with our TAM BMDMs and TAM MG RNA-seq data to discriminate tumor education differences from ontogenetic, non-tumor-associated differences. This juxtaposition allowed us to identify genes enriched in TAM MG versus TAM BMDMs as well as normal MG versus ''ectopic'' BMDMs. These ''core'' MG genes included not only known MG markers such as Jam2, Siglech, and P2ry12 but also complement factors C2, C4b, and Cfh as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines Ccl4 and Tnf (Figure S2D, n = 245 genes; Table S4). We identified genes enriched in TAM BMDMs (n = 294) specifically in the context of a tumor, including Il10, Cxcl2, Cxcl3, Ccl17, Ccl22, and H2-Dmb1 (Figure 2E). In contrast to this tumor-specific expression profile, there were also 164 core BMDM genes enriched in BMDM compared to MG, regardless of the presence or absence of a tumor, including Ciita, Ahr, Runx2, Runx3, Vav3, and Vdr (Figure 2E; Table S4). These data indicate some features distinguishing TAM BMDMs and TAM MG are inherent to their differential ontogenies, while others are only acquired upon interaction with, and education by, the tumor microenvironment.We next asked if the differences in inflammatory mediators were an inherent feature of BMDMs upon entry into the brain or rather a consequence of tumor education.

        <p>As many of the core BMDM genes are central players in innate immunity, we queried the immunological genome project database to determine if these genes were over-represented in any particular myeloid cell population. Interestingly, we found that these genes were actually repressed in MG compared to tissue-resident macrophages of the BM, spleen, lung, peritoneum, small intestine, and monocyte progenitors (Figure 2F). Meanwhile, core MG genes were indeed enriched in MG compared to other myeloid cells (Figure 2F). These data suggest that core BMDM genes are not specifically enriched in TAM BMDMs or macrophages in general but are specifically repressed in MG.As many of the core BMDM genes are central players in innate immunity, we queried the immunological genome project database to determine if these genes were over-represented in any particular myeloid cell population.

        <p>Recent studies have highlighted extensive epigenetic diversity among tissue-resident macrophages (Lavin et al., 2014); thus, we hypothesized that the MG-repressed genes may be epigenetically altered in MG compared to even the distantly related monocytes. Indeed, when we analyzed these published datasets, we observed increased H3K27 acetylation in the promoters of normal monocytes compared to normal MG for the core BMDM genes (Figure S2E). Similarly, there was increased H3K27 acetylation in the promoters of core MG genes in MG compared to monocytes (Figure S2E). Enhancer specification and epigenetic states in MG and other macrophage populations have been associated with differential PU.1 occupancy. Interrogating previously published data (Gosselin et al., 2014), we observed that several macrophage subsets (including BMDM) all showed increased PU.1 binding at the promoters of our core BMDM genes compared to normal MG (Figure S2F). Meanwhile, variability in PU.1 occupancy was minimal at the promoters of core MG genes (Figure S2F). Similar binding dynamics were evident in enhancer elements, where PU.1 occupancy in enhancer regions of core BMDM genes was higher in BMDMs than MG, with less pronounced differences present in core MG genes (Figure S2G). Thus, epigenetic landscapes established before the development of a tumor may play a role in regulating differential activation patterns subsequently observed in malignancy.Recent studies have highlighted extensive epigenetic diversity among tissue-resident macrophages (Lavin et al., 2014); thus, we hypothesized that the MG-repressed genes may be epigenetically altered in MG compared to even the distantly related monocytes.

        <p>Given the epigenetic differences in the non-malignant setting, we next determined if chromatin states also differed between TAM BMDMs and TAM MG. We performed assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) (Buenrostro et al., 2013) to assess chromatin accessibility in TAM BMDMs and TAM MG sorted from the GL261 model (Figure 1D). We found the ATAC-seq signal was associated with cell-type-specific gene expression. In TAM BMDMs, the promoters of core BMDM and TAM BMDM genes had higher ATAC-seq signal than core MG and TAM MG genes, while TAM MG promoters of core MG and TAM MG genes had a higher ATAC-seq signal than core BMDM and TAM BMDM genes (Figure S3A). Within enhancers and intronic elements of these gene sets, we identified 120 BMDM-specific peaks in TAM BMDM genes, including Vav3, and 704 MG-specific peaks in TAM MG genes, including P2ry12 and Sall1 (Figures 3A,S3B, and S3C; Table S5A).Given the epigenetic differences in the non-malignant setting, we next determined if chromatin states also differed between TAM BMDMs and TAM MG.

        <p>We analyzed the transcription factor (TF) landscape underlying these different peaks and performed de novo motif analysis (motifs are shown in all capital letters). Motif analysis of these peaks revealed an enrichment of FOS/JUN and PU.1 binding sites in both TAM BMDM and TAM MG peaks (Figure 3B; Table S5B), reinforcing previous analyses demonstrating the critical role of PU.1 in establishing specific enhancer landscapes in tissue-resident macrophages (Gosselin et al., 2014). Besides these shared enrichments, we found TAM BMDM peaks enriched for RUNX and CREB/bZIP motifs, while TAM MG peaks were enriched for SMAD3 and MEF2A motifs (Figure 3B).We analyzed the transcription factor (TF) landscape underlying these different peaks and performed de novo motif analysis (motifs are shown in all capital letters).

        <p>To determine if these motifs reflected pathway activation of particular TFs we modeled the expression of their predicted downstream targets (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We identified TF families with enriched activity in TAM BMDMs relative to TAM MG in the GEMM-shP53 and GL261 models (and vice versa) (Figures 3C andS3D). Among a panel of different TFs, EGR1 and MEF2A were enriched in TAM MG (Figures 3C andS3D; Table S5C). Interestingly, MEF2 is associated with MG identity (Lavin et al., 2014). In TAM BMDMs, TF motifs involved in monocyte to macrophage differentiation were enriched, including RUNX, CEBP, and PU.1 (Figures 3C andS3D) (Alder et al., 2008). STAT3 and IRF4 were also enriched (Figure 3C), both of which have been associated with differential functions in macrophage activation (Mosser and Edwards, 2008;Ostuni and Natoli, 2011). We complemented these genome-wide TF activity analyses with motif enrichment analysis on the promoters of TAM BMDM-specific and TAM MG-specific genes using HOMER (Heinz et al., 2010) (Figure S3E). This also revealed an enrichment of MEF2 motifs in TAM MG, demonstrating the consistent role of tissue-specific transcriptional programs in TAM MG education. Meanwhile, TAM BMDM-specific genes were again enriched in PU.1, RUNX, and CEBP motifs (Figure S3E). These findings were further corroborated by increased expression of brain-specific TFs (Mef2c, Sall1, and Sall3) in TAM MG, while TAM BMDMs were enriched for Ciita, Vdr, Ahr, and Runx family members (Figure 3D; Table S2A).To determine if these motifs reflected pathway activation of particular TFs we modeled the expression of their predicted downstream targets (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures).

        <p>Given the consistent enrichment of RUNX activity in TAM BMDMs, we next focused on examining the expression and chromatin state of Runx family members. Runx2 and Runx3 were enriched in TAM BMDMs compared to TAM MG (Figure 3D). While no differences were found in the chromatin state of Runx1 or Runx2, in the first intron of Runx3 (Figure 3E, ii), we observed a peak present in TAM MG but reduced in TAM BMDMs (Figure 3E). Meanwhile, the Runx3 promoter showed little open chromatin in TAM MG and a distinct peak in TAM BMDMs near the transcription start site (Figure 3E,i). Interestingly, both peaks have been shown to be transforming growth factor b (TGF-b)-responsive PU.1 binding sites associated with Runx3 expression (Chopin et al., 2013), indicating the same signal transduction pathway can produce distinct outputs in TAM BMDMs and TAM MG.Given the consistent enrichment of RUNX activity in TAM BMDMs, we next focused on examining the expression and chromatin state of Runx family members.

        <p>We also identified enrichment of the epigenetic modifiers Hdac7 and Hdac9 in TAM BMDMs, while Hdac11 was enriched in TAM MG (Figure S3F), the latter of which has been shown to repress Il10 expression in macrophages (Villagra et al., 2009). Interestingly, an upstream enhancer element in Hdac11 was significantly enriched in TAM MG compared to TAM BMDMs, a peak that contained a SMAD-responsive element (Figure 3F-i). Collectively, these results suggest that differential genomic PU.1 occupancy underlies distinct open chromatin states in BMDMs and MG, whereupon additional factors such as TGFb/SMAD signaling and RUNX family members cooperate with PU.1 to enforce distinct transcriptional networks. Subsequent regulation of TFs and chromatin modifying factors, such as Hdac11, may explain the distinct cytokine expression patterns observed, such as TAM BMDM expression of Il10 and TAM MG expression of Tnf.We also identified enrichment of the epigenetic modifiers Hdac7 and Hdac9 in TAM BMDMs, while Hdac11 was enriched in TAM MG (Figure S3F), the latter of which has been shown to repress Il10 expression in macrophages (Villagra et al., 2009).

        <p>We next sought to identify tools capable of distinguishing TAM BMDMs and TAM MG in human disease, where genetic lineage tracing is not possible. Given that TAM BMDMs in gliomas upregulated Cx3cr1 (Figure S1F), a proposed MG marker, we sought to identify TAM BMDM-specific markers that instead remained silent in TAM MG. From the 164 core BMDM genes, we identified 40 candidate transmembrane proteins that might serve as useful markers for flow cytometry. Among these, the integrin subunit alpha 4, Itga4/Cd49d, emerged as a promising candidate, particularly given previous reports that it, along with the integrin subunit alpha L, Itgal/Cd11a, is regulated by RUNX family members, including Runx1 and Runx3 (Domı ´nguez- Soto et al., 2005). Consistently, we found that Itga4 and Itgal were specifically repressed in MG compared to other macrophage populations (Figure S4A). This was confirmed by flow cytometry, where Cd49d expression in MG was negligible or absent compared to macrophages of the spleen, liver, lung, bone marrow, and blood Ly6C + monocytes (Figure 4A). Ly6G + granulocytes were also Cd49d À , which, along with Cd49d + lymphocytes in the Cd45 + Cd11b À gate, served as useful gating controls in subsequent experiments (Figure 4A).We next sought to identify tools capable of distinguishing TAM BMDMs and TAM MG in human disease, where genetic lineage tracing is not possible.

        <p>We examined Cd49d and Cd11a expression in TAM BMDMs and TAM MG using Flt3:Cre-based lineage tracing in the GEMM-shP53 model. After gating on Cd45 + Cd11b + Ly6C À Ly6G À cells, the normal brain only contained Cd45 low Cd49d À cells, and all peripheral monocytes were Cd45 high Cd49d + (Figure 4B). In tumors, we found two cell populations, Cd45 low Cd49d À and Cd45 high Cd49d + , which contained GFP À TdTomato + MG and GFP + TdTomato À BMDMs, respectively (Figure 4B). Similar results were found for Cd11a (Figure 4B) and were replicated in the GL261 model using both Cx3cr1based and Flt3:Cre lineage-tracing strategies (Figures S4B andS4C). Lastly, we evaluated Cd49d expression in a Pten loss-of-function PDGFB-driven glioma model (GEMM-Pten Flox ) where Pten Flox/Flox ; nTva + mice were injected with RCAS vectors encoding PDGFB and Cre (Huse et al., 2009). Using IR-BMT for lineage tracing, we found that Cd49d distinguishes donor and host-derived cells, including in glioma models with extended latency ($12 weeks for the GEMM-Pten Flox model) (Figure S4D).We examined Cd49d and Cd11a expression in TAM BMDMs and TAM MG using Flt3:Cre-based lineage tracing in the GEMM-shP53 model.

        <p>To evaluate other models of brain malignancy, we utilized an intracardiac injection model of brain metastasis (BrM) colonization using a tumor cell line (99LN-BrM). 99LN-BrM cells were originally derived from the lymph node of a MMTV:PyMT breast cancer GEMM and subjected to in vivo selection. We used this syngeneic, immunocompetent BrM model in conjunction with Cx3cr1-based lineage tracing and found that BrM lesions contained both TdTomato + Iba1 + and TdTomato À Iba1 + cells, indicating recruitment of both TAM MG and TAM BMDMs, respectively (Figures 4C and4D). We validated these findings by flow cytometry, where Cd49d and Cd11a served as reliable markers of BMDMs as in the glioma models described above (Figure 4E). We again found that eYFP levels, a direct readout of Cx3cr1 expression, were similar between TAM BMDMs and TAM MG in BrM, reinforcing the necessity of the Cx3cr1:CreER lineage tracing approach over that of the Cx3cr1 reporter (Figure S4E). Lastly, we confirmed these data in a well-established xenograft BrM model using brain homing MDA-MB-231 cells (Bos et al., 2009), in conjunction with IR-BMT lineage tracing using mRFP + donor cells. In this model, we identified two cell populations, Cd45 low Cd49d À MG and Cd45 high Cd49d + BMDM. The mRFP + donor cells were exclusively found within the Cd45 high Cd49d + BMDM gate (Figure S4F).To evaluate other models of brain malignancy, we utilized an intracardiac injection model of brain metastasis (BrM) colonization using a tumor cell line (99LN-BrM). 99LN-BrM cells were originally derived from the lymph node of a MMTV:PyMT breast cancer GEMM and subjected to in vivo selection.

        <p>Together, our results obtained in multiple models of brain malignancy with distinct lineage-tracing approaches demonstrate that TAM BMDM accumulation is independent of BBB preconditioning by IR or intracranial injection.

        <p>We next investigated whether CD49D could be used to discriminate MG and peripherally derived macrophages in human brain tumors. We assessed CD49D expression by flow cytometry across a panel of surgical samples composed of non-malignant normal brain (n = 3), untreated high-grade glioma (GBM) (n = 3), lung adenocarcinomas (n = 6), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (n = 6). Consistent with our data in mice, granulocytes (CD45 + CD11B + CD66B + CD14 low CD16 + ) did not express CD49D, and were used as a reference guide for gating CD49D + and CD49D À TAMs (Figure S5A). Importantly, we never identified CD49D À TAMs in primary lung tumors or CD49D À monocytes in healthy donor PBMCs, indicating that, as predicted, low expression of CD49D is restricted to MG and is not a general phenotype of tissue-resident macrophages (Figure 5A). By contrast, the CD45 + CD11B + CD66B À CD14 + CD16 À compartment in non-malignant brain was predominantly composed of CD49D À MG (Figure 5A). Critically, in each GBM sample we identified both CD49D + and CD49D À TAMs, presumably representing BMDM and brain-resident MG, respectively (Figure 5A).We next investigated whether CD49D could be used to discriminate MG and peripherally derived macrophages in human brain tumors. We assessed CD49D expression by flow cytometry across a panel of surgical samples composed of non-malignant normal brain (n = 3), untreated high-grade glioma (GBM) (n = 3), lung adenocarcinomas (n = 6), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (n = 6).

        <p>Interestingly, in human samples, we found no difference in CD45 expression between CD49D À and CD49D + TAMs (Figure 5B), a marker previously suggested to be informative for distinguishing BMDMs and MG in brain malignancy (Hussain et al., 2006;Parney et al., 2009;Sedgwick et al., 1991). Indeed, CD45 expression differed most prominently between granulocytes and TAMs, as opposed to MG and BMDMs (Figure 5B). However, this lack of differential CD45 expression is not the case in mouse, where Cd45 adequately discriminates MG and BMDM in the models tested (Figure 5B). We next sorted paired CD49D À and CD49D + TAMs from GBM patients to verify these populations indeed reflected TAM MG and TAM BMDMs, respectively. Using genes specific for TAM MG and TAM BMDMs from our mouse models (Figure 2A), we found that CD49D À TAMs were indeed enriched for TAM MG genes (p % 7.78 3 10 À3 ), while CD49D + TAMs were enriched for TAM BMDM genes (p % 5.01 3 10 À3 ) (Figure 5C).Interestingly, in human samples, we found no difference in CD45 expression between CD49D À and CD49D + TAMs (Figure 5B), a marker previously suggested to be informative for distinguishing BMDMs and MG in brain malignancy (Hussain et al., 2006;Parney et al., 2009;Sedgwick et al., 1991).

        <p>Previous analyses of TAM expression in human gliomas have utilized bulk CD11B + cells, a population likely composed of both TAM BMDMs and TAM MG, as well as other myeloid populations. We queried one available RNA-seq dataset from bulk CD11B + cells (Szulzewsky et al., 2016), which showed increased ITGA4/CD49D expression in purified CD11B + cells in GBM compared to normal MG from either post-mortem samples or resections from epileptic patients (Figure S5B). This was complemented by a relative decrease in the MG-enriched transcript P2RY12 in GBM compared to non-malignant brain (Figure S5B). In querying an additional microarray-based dataset of purified CD11B + cells (Gabrusiewicz et al., 2016), we observed that peripheral blood CD11B + cells from GBM patients expressed similar levels of ITGA4 compared to GBM tumor samples, while there was higher P2RY12 expression in GBM samples than in pe-ripheral blood (Figure S5C), as we would have expected. We extended these analyses to whole-tissue RNA-seq data from the TCGA-GBM cohort (Brennan et al., 2013) and observed that ITGA4 expression was significantly increased in GBM compared to normal brain (Figure S5D). Collectively, these analyses suggest that TAMs in GBM represent a heterogeneous population composed of both BMDMs and MG, reinforcing the necessity of refined sorting strategies for accurate discrimination between these cells and highlighting the utility of a CD49Dbased gating approach.Previous analyses of TAM expression in human gliomas have utilized bulk CD11B + cells, a population likely composed of both TAM BMDMs and TAM MG, as well as other myeloid populations.

        <p>We next assessed TAM BMDM and TAM MG gene set expression in the TCGA cohort as a whole. TAM BMDM genes and TAM MG genes showed high intra-gene set correlation, where TAM BMDM genes such as RUNX2, IL10, RUNX3, ITGA4, and VDR showed significant pairwise correlations and TAM MG genes such as MEF2C, P2RY12, RXRG, SALL1, KLF12 and SALL3 similarly showed significant pairwise correlations (Figure S5E). Moreover, ITGA4 showed a high correlation with a TAM BMDM gene signature score (p % 2.2 3 10 À16 ), but not with a TAM MG signature score (Figure 5D), showing increased ITGA4 expression is specific to TAM BMDM abundance and not TAMs as a whole.We next assessed TAM BMDM and TAM MG gene set expression in the TCGA cohort as a whole.

        <p>Previous transcriptional and epigenetic analyses have identified distinct GBM subtypes (Noushmehr et al., 2010;Verhaak et al., 2010), where the mesenchymal subtype was enriched for tumor stroma and inflammatory molecules. Here, we find TAM BMDM signature scores are significantly different among molecular subtypes of GBM (p % 2.2 3 10 À16 ), with the highest scores in the mesenchymal GBM subtype and the lowest scores in G-CIMP patients (Figure 5E). Correspondingly, TAM BMDM signature scores were lowest in patients with IDH1 mutations (Figure 5F; p % 5.93 3 10 À3 ). By comparison, TAM MG signature scores displayed a blunted association with tumor subtype (p % 0.041) and no association with IDH1 mutation status (p % 0.153) (Figures S5F andS5G). These analyses reinforce our findings that TAM BMDMs and TAM MG are distinguishable immune cell populations with distinct abundance and characteristics in specific subtypes of human GBM.Previous transcriptional and epigenetic analyses have identified distinct GBM subtypes (Noushmehr et al., 2010;Verhaak et al., 2010), where the mesenchymal subtype was enriched for tumor stroma and inflammatory molecules.

        <p>IR-BMT has been used widely in animal models to perform lineage tracing of TAMs in brain malignancy (Ajami et al., 2007;De Figure 5.

        <p>Other than IR-BMT, the most widely employed approach to discriminate MG and peripherally derived macrophages relies upon Cd45 expression, with Cd45 high cells considered BMDMs and Cd45 low cells considered MG (Gabrusiewicz et al., 2011;Sedgwick et al., 1991). While this marker seems adequate in the murine models we have employed here, cell-type-specific CD45 expression appears to be different between mouse and human. Our data indicate that CD45 does not accurately discriminate MG and BMDMs in patient samples, emphasizing the need for extensive flow cytometry panels to clearly distinguish these cells in both species. Additionally, our genetic lineage tracing models also show that expression of Cx3cr1, which is commonly used to trace normal MG, is subject to upregulation in BMDMs upon tumor education (Figures 2A, S1F, andS4E) and thus cannot be used to discriminate MG and BMDMs in brain tumors.Other than IR-BMT, the most widely employed approach to discriminate MG and peripherally derived macrophages relies upon Cd45 expression, with Cd45 high cells considered BMDMs and Cd45 low cells considered MG (Gabrusiewicz et al., 2011;Sedgwick et al., 1991).

        <p>Instead, we present Itga4 (Cd49d) as an effective, consistent marker that works in both mice and humans to distinguish MG and peripherally derived macrophages in multiple brain malignancies. Cd49d may also prove a useful tool in determining the precise origin and kinetics of peripherally derived macrophages in brain tumors. Recent efforts to understand the heterogeneity and origins of non-parenchymal myeloid cells in the brain (including perivascular, meningeal, and choroid plexus macrophages) revealed that a subset of these cells are labeled using similar Flt3-Cre and Cx3cr1-CreER based lineage tracing systems as employed here (Goldmann et al., 2016). Thus it will be of interest to determine if any of these populations, in addition to monocytes, contribute to the TAM pool.Instead, we present Itga4 (Cd49d) as an effective, consistent marker that works in both mice and humans to distinguish MG and peripherally derived macrophages in multiple brain malignancies.

        <p>Our data support the hypothesis that epigenetic states influence stimulus-dependent transcriptional induction, thus leading to differential TAM education between MG and BMDMs. Differential genomic occupancy of PU.1 between MG and other macrophage populations in non-cancer contexts has been shown to dictate differential enhancer selection (Gosselin et al., 2014). Indeed, within this dataset, we found that PU.1 binding sites at enhancers and promoters were already different between MG and BMDM for the genes we identified to be specific to their respective TAM populations. This suggests that TAM BMDMs and TAM MG are poised to engage in different transcriptional networks based on initial enhancer selection. It is likely that differential expression of binding partners influences PU.1 genomic occupation. Cooperative binding is evident between PU.1 and CEBPb to promote macrophage differentiation and in B cell development, where PU.1 occupancy is influenced by E2A expression (Heinz et al., 2010). Such a hypothesis has also been shown to account for MG-specific PU.1 binding in cooperation with TGF-b-induced SMAD activity (Gosselin et al., 2014). Similar dynamics may be at play in brain tumors, where binding partners that are absent in MG and expressed in BMDMs can sculpt genomic PU.1 occupancy. For example, the RUNX family member Runx3 is one such candidate, which is enriched in TAM BMDMs versus TAM MG and shows motif enrichment in promoters where PU.1 binds in BMDMs, but not MG.Our data support the hypothesis that epigenetic states influence stimulus-dependent transcriptional induction, thus leading to differential TAM education between MG and BMDMs. Differential genomic occupancy of PU.1 between MG and other macrophage populations in non-cancer contexts has been shown to dictate differential enhancer selection (Gosselin et al., 2014).

        <p>While our studies here focus predominantly on identifying recurrent signatures distinguishing TAM MG and TAM BMDMs across multiple mouse models and patient samples, there were also tumor-specific gene expression patterns in TAM education (Figures 2E, S2C, andS2D), which may provide insights into how tumor-derived signals can generate inter-tumoral heterogeneity in TAM activation profiles. In addition, analysis of TCGA data showed that gene signatures associated with TAM BMDMs were differentially enriched in the distinct tumor subtypes of GBM. Recent reports have identified mixed activation states in bulk TAM populations in glioma patients (Gabrusiewicz et al., 2016;Szulzewsky et al., 2016), and our data now show that TAM MG and TAM BMDMs possess distinct activation states, potentially resolving this mixed phenotype. Importantly, the identification of CD49D as a cell-surface marker to discriminate between TAM MG and TAM BMDMs in human disease will permit extensive interrogation of these cell populations in patient samples.While our studies here focus predominantly on identifying recurrent signatures distinguishing TAM MG and TAM BMDMs across multiple mouse models and patient samples, there were also tumor-specific gene expression patterns in TAM education (Figures 2E, S2C, andS2D), which may provide insights into how tumor-derived signals can generate inter-tumoral heterogeneity in TAM activation profiles.

        <p>Collectively, the studies presented here definitively demonstrate that peripherally derived macrophages are indeed present in multiple mouse and human brain malignancies and have distinct transcriptional profiles from their brain-resident counterparts. We posit that while macrophages can acquire tissueresident macrophage-like traits upon entry into a tissue (Lavin et al., 2014), an inflammatory microenvironment, such as in the context of cancer or neuroinflammation, may further amplify differences between the cells, leading to diverse functional outcomes for tissue-resident and peripherally derived macrophage populations.Collectively, the studies presented here definitively demonstrate that peripherally derived macrophages are indeed present in multiple mouse and human brain malignancies and have distinct transcriptional profiles from their brain-resident counterparts.

Antibodies and methods for immunohistochemistry can be found in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.</p>
        <p>RNA Sequencing, ATAC Sequencing, and Bioinformatics RNA was isolated by chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation. RNA-sequencing libraries were generated with the SMART-Seq preparation kit (CloneTech). Single-end, 100-bp sequencing was performed by 
            <rs type="software">GeneWiz</rs> on an Illumina HiSeq 2500. FASTQ files were mapped to the mouse genome (mm10) or the human genome (hg19) using 
            <rs type="software">STAR</rs> (version 
            <rs type="version">2.5.0e</rs>) with default parameters (Dobin et al., 2013). Transcript abundance was quantified using 
            <rs type="software">STAR</rs> with a GTF file from iGenomes (Illumina). A count matrix was produced in 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> and differential gene expression was assessed with DESeq2 using a fold change cutoff of ±2 and a false discovery rate of 5% (Love et al., 2014). Gene Ontology analysis was performed using 
            <rs type="software">DAVID</rs> with default parameters (Dennis et al., 2003). ATAC-sequencing was performed as previously described (Buenrostro et al., 2013). Paired-end, 50-bp sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 with an average read depth of $35,000,000 reads per sample. Reads were mapped to mm10 using 
            <rs type="software">STAR</rs> (version 
            <rs type="version">2.5.0e</rs>) using 
            <rs type="software">(-alignIntronMax 1-alignEndsType EndToEnd</rs>). Peak calling, annotation, and differential peak identification was performed using HOMER.
