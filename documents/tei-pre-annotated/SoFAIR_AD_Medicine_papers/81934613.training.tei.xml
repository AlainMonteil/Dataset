        <p>BACKGROUND: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, severe disease characterized by worsening right-sided heart failure, decreasing functional status, and poor survival. Th e present study characterizes the 5-year survival in the United States of a new and previous diagnosis of PAH in patients stratifi ed by baseline functional class (FC). Th e Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-term PAH Disease Management (REVEAL Registry) is a 55-center observational US registry of the demographics, disease course, and management of patients with World Health Organization (WHO) group 1 PAH. METHODS: The REVEAL Registry enrolled newly and previously diagnosed patients aged Ն 3 months with WHO group 1 PAH consecutively from March 2006 to December 2009. Demographics, disease characteristics, and hemodynamic data were collected at enrollment. Survival analysis was conducted by FC and other subgroups in patients aged Ն 18 years.BACKGROUND: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, severe disease characterized by worsening right-sided heart failure, decreasing functional status, and poor survival.

        <p>Survival diff erences between previously diagnosed and newly diagnosed patients at 1 year (90.4% vs 86.3%) were maintained to 5 years; 5-year survival for previously diagnosed patients was 65.4% compared with 61.2% for newly diagnosed patients.

        <p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, severe disease characterized by worsening right-sided heart failure, decreasing functional status, and poor survival. 1 Outcome evaluation by functional class (FC) is a key variable in many predictive models of PAH. Because either improvement or decline of FC over time significantly predicts patient survival, 2 attainment of FC I or II is a critical treatment goal in practice and clinical trials. [2][3][4] Although the association between FC and survival is well established, limited survival estimates exist in the literature for FC subgroups. Additionally, most available data have evaluated survival to 3 years and are based on site cohort studies. 2,5,6 Previous studies examining survival data based on FC have a small sample size and do not refl ect current treatment strategies. 2,[5][6][7][8] To date, there has been no multicenter, long-term analysis of survival by FC from a large cohort of patients with PAH.Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, severe disease characterized by worsening right-sided heart failure, decreasing functional status, and poor survival. 1 Outcome evaluation by functional class (FC) is a key variable in many predictive models of PAH.

        <p>Th e poorest outcome was observed among patients in FC III or IV in both previously and newly diagnosed cohorts, with 5-year survival rates of 57.0% and 27.2%, and 60.0% and 43.8%, respectively. In addition to baseline FC status, FC change with treatment impacts patient outcome. A large number of newly diagnosed FC III and IV patients improved one FC within 12 months of enrollment. A previous REVEAL Registry analysis demonstrated that improvement from FC III to FC I/II is associated with signifi cantly better survival than had the patient remained in FC III or worsened to FC IV. 9 Previously diagnosed patients classifi ed as FC IV at enrollment have prior PAH-specifi c therapy exposure and fewer therapeutic options and may, thus, represent a cohort of patients nonresponsive or less responsive to therapy. In contrast, newly diagnosed patients classifi ed as FC IV at enrollment represent a treatment-naive population with a greater opportunity to improve with PAH-specifi c therapy. 18 Th is analysis demonstrates single point-in-time measurement of FC remains among the most important predictors of future survival in patients with PAH, despite its limitations.

        <p>Of note, survival analysis in PAH cohorts are prone to survivor bias 19 when patients with diff erent disease durations are pooled. Under these conditions, survival estimates for the overall cohort are more favorable than if the survival estimate is derived using newly diagnosed patients only, since prevalent patients have a better prognosis than incident or newly diagnosed patients. 5,13 Previously and newly diagnosed patients have diff erent risk profi les because many higher-risk patients do not survive for a suffi cient duration to be enrolled as previously diagnosed patients. Th us, the previously diagnosed cohort will always contain a smaller percentage of patients in FC IV compared with the newly diagnosed cohort.

        <p>Here, the survival disadvantage of newly diagnosed patients is most pronounced among patients in FC I and II, suggesting a relatively favorable risk profile at diagnosis reflects an earlier diagnosis but does not necessarily guarantee a good outcome. Conversely, any survival advantage associated with a previous diagnosis is absent for patients in FC III and IV. Previously diagnosed patients who remain short of treatment goals (eg, FC III) likely have less potential for future improvement, but a negative outcome is not inevitable. Improvement in a high percentage of patients in newly diagnosed FC III is likely related to administration of initial PAH-specifi c therapy within 90 days before or 90 days aft er enrollment, thus providing an opportunity to respond to treatment. In contrast, few previously diagnosed patients initiated fi rst PAH-specifi c therapy at enrollment, and a smaller percentage in the previously diagnosed FC III group at enrollment improved to FC II, suggesting an already maximized response. Although treatment decisions were left to the contributing providers and were not mandated by REVEAL Registry, it is clear that patients experience greatest risk in the initial months aft er diagnosis. [20][21][22][23] Th us, treatment should be initiated as early as possible as newly diagnosed patients are at greatest risk and have the greatest opportunity to show functional improvements. FC assessment is remarkably predictive of survival in PAH; its use as a tool in clinical practice and trials should continue.Here, the survival disadvantage of newly diagnosed patients is most pronounced among patients in FC I and II, suggesting a relatively favorable risk profile at diagnosis reflects an earlier diagnosis but does not necessarily guarantee a good outcome.

Previously diagnosed patients who remain short of treatment goals (eg, FC III) likely have less potential for future improvement, but a negative outcome is not inevitable. Improvement in a high percentage of patients in newly diagnosed FC III is likely related to administration of initial PAH-specifi c therapy within 90 days before or 90 days aft er enrollment, thus providing an opportunity to respond to treatment. In contrast, few previously diagnosed patients initiated fi rst PAH-specifi c therapy at enrollment, and a smaller percentage in the previously diagnosed FC III group at enrollment improved to FC II, suggesting an already maximized response. Although treatment decisions were left to the contributing providers and were not mandated by REVEAL Registry, it is clear that patients experience greatest risk in the initial months aft er diagnosis. [20][21][22][23] Th us, treatment should be initiated as early as possible as newly diagnosed patients are at greatest risk and have the greatest opportunity to show functional improvements. FC assessment is remarkably predictive of survival in PAH; its use as a tool in clinical practice and trials should continue.</p>
