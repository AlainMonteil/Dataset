        <p>The aim of this systematic review was to report pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of coronavirus spectrum infections, and particularly coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease because of severe acute respiratory syndromeecoronavirus-2 infection during pregnancy. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, Cinahl, and Clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched electronically utilizing combinations of word variants for coronavirus or severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS or Middle East respiratory syndrome or MERS or COVID-19 and pregnancy. The search and selection criteria were restricted to English language. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Inclusion criteria were hospitalized pregnant women with a confirmed coronavirus relatedeillness, defined as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), or COVID-19. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: We used meta-analyses of proportions to combine data and reported pooled proportions, so that a pooled proportion may not coincide with the actual raw proportion in the results. The pregnancy outcomes observed included miscarriage, preterm birth, preeclampsia, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, fetal growth restriction, and mode of delivery. The perinatal outcomes observed were fetal distress, Apgar score &lt;7 at 5 minutes, neonatal asphyxia, admission to a neonatal intensive care unit, perinatal death, and evidence of vertical transmission. RESULTS: Nineteen studies including 79 hospitalized women were eligible for this systematic review: 41 pregnancies (51.9%) affected by COVID-19, 12 (15.2%) by MERS, and 26 (32.9%) by SARS. An overt diagnosis of pneumonia was made in 91.8%, and the most common symptoms were fever (82.6%), cough (57.1%), and dyspnea (27.0%). For all coronavirus infections, the pooled proportion of miscarriage was 64.7% (8/12; 95% confidence interval, 37.9-87.3), although reported only for women affected by SARS in two studies with no control group; the pooled proportion of preterm birth &lt;37 weeks was 24.3% (14/56; 95% confidence interval, 12.5e38.6); premature prelabor rupture of membranes occurred in 20.7% (6/34; 95% confidence interval, 9.5e34.9), preeclampsia in 16.2% (2/19; 95% confidence interval, 4.2e34.1), and fetal growth restriction in 11.7% (2/29; 95% confidence interval, 3.2e24.4), although reported only for women affected by SARS; 84% (50/58) were delivered by cesarean; the pooled proportion of perinatal death was 11.1% (5/60; 95% confidence interval, 84.8e19.6), and 57.2% of newborns (3/12; 95% confidence interval, 3.6e99.8) were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. When focusing on COVID-19, the most common adverse pregnancy outcome was preterm birth &lt;37 weeks, occurring in 41.1% of cases (14/32; 95% confidence interval, 25.6e57.6), while the pooled proportion of perinatal death was 7.0% (2/41; 95% confidence interval, 1.4e16.3). None of the 41 newborns assessed showed clinical signs of vertical transmission. CONCLUSION: In hospitalized mothers infected with coronavirus infections, including COVID-19, &gt;90% of whom also had pneumonia, preterm birth is the most common adverse pregnancy outcome. COVID-19 infection was associated with higher rate (and pooled proportions) of preterm birth, preeclampsia, cesarean, and perinatal death. There have been no published cases of clinical evidence of vertical transmission. Evidence is accumulating rapidly, so these data may need to be updated soon. The findings from this study can guide and enhance prenatal counseling of women with COVID-19 infection occurring during pregnancy, although they should be interpreted with caution in view of the very small number of included cases.The aim of this systematic review was to report pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of coronavirus spectrum infections, and particularly coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease because of severe acute respiratory syndromeecoronavirus-2 infection during pregnancy.

        <p>After beginning as an epidemic in China, COVID-19 infection has rapidly spread in many other countries, and the number of affected cases continues to increase significantly on a daily basis. The overall mortality rate ranges from 3% to 4% according to the World Health Organization reports, 6 but a higher rate of patients require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). 7 It is well known that physiologic maternal adaptations to pregnancy predispose pregnant women to a more severe course of pneumonia, with subsequent higher maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality, 1,8 but there is a lack of data in the literature about the effect of CoV infections during pregnancy, thus limiting both counseling and management of these patients.After beginning as an epidemic in China, COVID-19 infection has rapidly spread in many other countries, and the number of affected cases continues to increase significantly on a daily basis.

        <p>Between-study heterogeneity was explored using the I 2 statistic, which represents the percentage of between-study variation that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance. A value of 0% indicates no observed heterogeneity, whereas I 2 values 50% indicate a substantial level of heterogeneity. In view of the clinical heterogeneity, a random-effect model was used to compute the pooled data analyses. Therefore, polled proportions were used, also given small numbers, but should not be confused with raw proportions (rates). A pooled proportion may not coincide with the actual raw proportion.

        <p>Pregnancies affected by CoV infections have high rates (and pooled proportions) of PTB before 37 and 34 weeks. Preeclampsia and cesarean delivery are also more common than in the general population. The pooled proportion of perinatal mortality is about 10%, while the most common adverse perinatal outcome is fetal distress, with more than half of the newborns admitted in the NICU. Importantly, clinical evidence of vertical transmission was found in none of the newborns included. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution in view of the very small number of included cases and heterogeneity in clinical presentation and perinatal management among the included cases.Pregnancies affected by CoV infections have high rates (and pooled proportions) of PTB before 37 and 34 weeks.

        <p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review exploring pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of CoV infections occurring during pregnancy. This comprehensive meta-analysis included all series published so far on this topic. The small number of cases in some of the included studies, their retrospective nonrandomized design, and the lack of standardized criteria for the antenatal surveillance, management, and timing of delivery of pregnancies affected by CoV infections represent the major limitations of this systematic review, thus making it difficult to draw any convincing evidence on this clinical management strategies. Furthermore, there is a possibility that some patients were included in more than 1 report, although 2 authors independently reviewed all the included studies, carefully focusing on the different Institutions reporting outcomes.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review exploring pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of CoV infections occurring during pregnancy.

        <p>Moreover, when focusing on the outcomes of COVID-19 infection, and particularly perinatal outcomes, reported data are intuitively limited to a very short-term follow-up period and thus infectious that occurred proximate to the delivery. This has the potential to overestimate the magnitude of risks such as PTB and underestimate more longitudinal risks such as FGR.Moreover, when focusing on the outcomes of COVID-19 infection, and particularly perinatal outcomes, reported data are intuitively limited to a very short-term follow-up period and thus infectious that occurred proximate to the delivery.

        <p>Additionally, it was not possible to extrapolate data about the pooled proportions of both spontaneous and iatrogenic PTB and indications for CD that was performed in the majority of cases; furthermore, few outcomes (ie, fetal distress) were not clearly defined, thus leading to some discrepancies in the results, like the pooled proportion of PTB &lt;34 weeks (15%) and the pooled proportion of newborns admitted to the NICU (9%), particularly in COVID-19 infection.Additionally, it was not possible to extrapolate data about the pooled proportions of both spontaneous and iatrogenic PTB and indications for CD that was performed in the majority of cases; furthermore, few outcomes (ie, fetal distress) were not clearly defined, thus leading to some discrepancies in the results, like the pooled proportion of PTB &lt;34 weeks (15%) and the pooled proportion of newborns admitted to the NICU (9%), particularly in COVID-19 infection.</p>
        <p>Another limitation of the present review was the lack of stratification of the analysis according to the gestational age at CoV infection because of the very small number of included studies for each trimester of pregnancy. We cannot assume that the pooled proportions of miscarriage (only reported for SARS infection) and PTB should be attributed solely to the virus/infection because there are no comparable control groups of uninfected women from the same time. It may be that the stress of the situation in the community contributed to some of these outcomes.Another limitation of the present review was the lack of stratification of the analysis according to the gestational age at CoV infection because of the very small number of included studies for each trimester of pregnancy.

        <p>Implications COVID-19 is the last CoV infection identified at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. 5 Currently, Europe has become the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, 6 but the infection has spread in more than 150 countries, leading governments to adopt rigorous mitigation measures to reduce both the viral spread and its detrimental effects on health care systems and therefore on the whole economy of the countries. 35 Despite the relatively low mortality, one of the main concerns related to COVID-19 infection is the development of an acute respiratory distress syndrome, often requiring invasive ventilation, that is the clinical epiphenomenon of the viral pneumonia. 6,7 The lack of knowledge about COVID-19 infection has raised urgent questions among physicians regarding clinical management and expected outcomes of the affected patients, and therefore, there is currently a compelling need of data to guide clinical decisions.Implications COVID-19 is the last CoV infection identified at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. 5 Currently, Europe has become the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, 6 but the infection has spread in more than 150 countries, leading governments to adopt rigorous mitigation measures to reduce both the viral spread and its detrimental effects on health care systems and therefore on the whole economy of the countries. 35 Despite the relatively low mortality, one of the main concerns related to COVID-19 infection is the development of an acute respiratory distress syndrome, often requiring invasive ventilation, that is the clinical epiphenomenon of the viral pneumonia. 6,7 The lack of knowledge about COVID-19 infection has raised urgent questions among physicians regarding clinical management and expected outcomes of the affected patients, and therefore, there is currently a compelling need of data to guide clinical decisions.</p>
        <p>Regarding pregnancy, the findings from this study found that radiological features suggestive for pneumonia can be found in almost all of the hospitalized pregnant women, usually presenting with fever, cough, and lymphopenia similar to the nonpregnant population. Of note, serious conditions requiring admission to the ICU and mechanical ventilation are significantly less common when compared with the 2 previous CoV infections (MERS and SARS). Similarly, we found no case of maternal death related to COVID-19 infection, while MERS and SARS infections caused a mortality pooled proportion in pregnant women ranging from 25% to 30%.Regarding pregnancy, the findings from this study found that radiological features suggestive for pneumonia can be found in almost all of the hospitalized pregnant women, usually presenting with fever, cough, and lymphopenia similar to the nonpregnant population.

        <p>In this systematic review, women affected by COVID-19 disease had higher rates of preterm birth, and preeclampsia, while the babies had a 2.4% rate of stillbirth, a 2.4% rate of neonatal death, and higher rate of admission to the NICU.In this systematic review, women affected by COVID-19 disease had higher rates of preterm birth, and preeclampsia, while the babies had a 2.4% rate of stillbirth, a 2.4% rate of neonatal death, and higher rate of admission to the NICU.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, because all the included studies reported data on hospitalized women, the reported rates and pooled proportions of infection-related adverse outcomes, including pregnancy and perinatal outcomes, might not reflect the overall population of pregnant when who got infected with SARSe coronavirus-2, and there may be a cohort of patients with no or mild symptoms whose pregnancy outcome is, as of yet, unknown. 36 More importantly, it should be emphasized that there are no known neonatal symptoms and therefore no clinical evidence suggestive for vertical transmission, particularly when COVID-19 infection occurs later in pregnancy. Unfortunately, the lack of data of firstand early second-trimester infection does not allow to determine whether in this case the infection may cause more severe perinatal outcomes and how to monitor the pregnancy once the infection has passed. 1 Based on the limited information from this study, COVID-19 cannot be considered as an indication for delivery, and therefore, the timing and mode of delivery should be individualized Systematic Review according to maternal clinical conditions or obstetric factors as usual (and not COVID-19 status alone), and the decision should involve a multidisciplinary team including maternal-fetal doctors, neonatologists, anesthesiologists, and infective disease specialists.Furthermore, because all the included studies reported data on hospitalized women, the reported rates and pooled proportions of infection-related adverse outcomes, including pregnancy and perinatal outcomes, might not reflect the overall population of pregnant when who got infected with SARSe coronavirus-2, and there may be a cohort of patients with no or mild symptoms whose pregnancy outcome is, as of yet, unknown. 36 More importantly, it should be emphasized that there are no known neonatal symptoms and therefore no clinical evidence suggestive for vertical transmission, particularly when COVID-19 infection occurs later in pregnancy.

        <p>In summary, with the limited data reported to date, hospitalized mothers infected with coronavirus infections, including COVID-19, &gt;90% of whom also had pneumonia, are at increased risks of adverse obstetrical outcomes, compared with the general population and in particular, COVID-19 infection was associated with a relatively higher rates of preterm birth, preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, and perinatal death. There have been no published cases of clinical evidence of vertical transmission. Evidence is accumulating rapidly, so these data may need to be updated soon.In summary, with the limited data reported to date, hospitalized mothers infected with coronavirus infections, including COVID-19, &gt;90% of whom also had pneumonia, are at increased risks of adverse obstetrical outcomes, compared with the general population and in particular, COVID-19 infection was associated with a relatively higher rates of preterm birth, preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, and perinatal death.
