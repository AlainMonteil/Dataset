        <p>Aims/hypothesis Empagliflozin (EMPA), an inhibitor of the renal sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2, reduces the risk of cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes. The underlying mechanism of this effect is unknown. Elevated cardiac cytoplasmic Na + ([Na + ] c ) and Ca 2+ ([Ca 2+ ] c ) concentrations and decreased mitochondrial Ca 2+ concentration ([Ca 2+ ] m ) are drivers of heart failure and cardiac death. We therefore hypothesised that EMPA would directly modify [Na + ] c , [Ca 2+ ] c and [Ca 2+ ] m in cardiomyocytes. Methods [Na + ] c, [Ca 2+ ] c , [Ca 2+ ] m and Na + /H + exchanger (NHE) activity were measured fluorometrically in isolated ventricular myocytes from rabbits and rats. Results An increase in extracellular glucose, from 5.5 mmol/l to 11 mmol/l, resulted in increased [Na + ] c and [Ca 2+ ] c levels. EMPA treatment directly inhibited NHE flux, caused a reduction in [Na + ] c and [Ca 2+ ] c and increased [Ca 2+ ] m . After pretreatment with the NHE inhibitor, Cariporide, these effects of EMPA were strongly reduced. EMPA also affected [Na + ] c and NHE flux in the absence of extracellular glucose. Conclusions/interpretation The glucose lowering kidneytargeted agent, EMPA, demonstrates direct cardiac effects by lowering myocardial [Na + ] c and [Ca 2+ ] c and enhancing [Ca 2+ ] m , through impairment of myocardial NHE flux, independent of SGLT2 activity.Aims/hypothesis Empagliflozin (EMPA), an inhibitor of the renal sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2, reduces the risk of cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes.

        <p>The recent Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) study has demonstrated that empagliflozin (EMPA), an inhibitor of renal sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2, resulted in a 38% reduction in the relative risk of cardiovascular death and a 35% risk reduction of hospitalisation for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes [1]. SGLT2 inhibitors also result in increased urinary glucose excretion in diabetic patients. The mechanisms behind these effects are unknown [1,2], however, since these findings do not suggest any beneficial effects of EMPA on the incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke, it is unlikely that they can be ascribed to a general reduction in risk factors for cardiovascular disease (e.g. glycaemic status, body weight, blood pressure). We hypothesised that EMPA has a direct cardiac effect; since increases in myocardial intracellular Na + and Ca 2+ concentrations are early hallmarks and drivers of cardiovascular death and heart failure [2][3][4][5][6], we investigated whether EMPA (1) directly reduces intracellular cardiac cytoplasmic Na + ([Na + ] c ) and Ca 2+ ([Ca 2+ ] c ) concentration; (2) affect the (upstream) cardiac Na + /H + exchanger (NHE); and (3) changes (downstream) mitochondrial Ca 2+ concentration ([Ca 2+ ] m ).The recent Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) study has demonstrated that empagliflozin (EMPA), an inhibitor of renal sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2, resulted in a 38% reduction in the relative risk of cardiovascular death and a 35% risk reduction of hospitalisation for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes [1].

        <p>For detailed methods, see electronic supplementary material [ESM] Methods. Cardiomyocytes were isolated from hearts from healthy rabbits and rats. Cells were left untreated or treated with 1 μmol/l EMPA (MedChem Express, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA), 5.5 mmol/l or 11 mmol/l glucose (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie, Zwijndrecht, the Netherlands), 10 μmol/l cariporide (Aventis Pharma, Frankfurt, Germany) or 20 mmol NH 4 Cl (NH + ) (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie), either alone or in combination. [Na + ] c and [Ca 2+ ] c were fluorometrically measured in rabbit cardiomyocytes using SBF1 and indo-1, respectively, at 2 Hz field stimulation. NHE activity was measured in rabbit cardiomyocytes by recording SNARF fluorescence following an NH 4 + pulse. Using adenoviral transfection, a ratiometric mitochondrially targeted fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based Ca 2+ indicator (4mtD3cpv, MitoCam) was expressed in rat cardiomyocytes and free [Ca 2+ ] m was measured using the fluorescence ratio, yellow fluorescent protein intensity/cyan fluorescent protein intensity (YFP/CFP), in cultured adult rat cardiomyocytes.For detailed methods, see electronic supplementary material [ESM] Methods.

EMPA (1 μmol/l) decreased [Na + ] c within 10 min (Fig. 1a). Vehicle administration had no effect (data not shown). In addition, similar acute EMPA effects were observed for diastolic and systolic [Ca 2+ ] c (Fig. 1b,c).EMPA decreases [Ca 2+ ] c and [Na + ] c and increases [Ca 2+ ] m First, we examined the acute effects of EMPA in isolated rabbit cardiomyocytes in the presence of 11 mmol/l glucose.

        <p>Empagliflozin impairs cardiac NHE activity without SGLT involvement Because the rapid action of EMPA resembled that of the NHE-inhibitor Cariporide on [Na + ] c and [Ca 2+ ] c [3], we investigated whether EMPA has NHE-inhibiting properties. First, we examined EMPA and Cariporide interactions on [Na + ] c. Following the reduction in [Na + ] c with EMPA, additional application of Cariporide had only a minimal effect on [Na + ] c (Fig. 2a). Similarly, following the reduction in [Na + ] c with 10 min pre-treatment with Cariporide, subsequent EMPA application had a minimal effect on [Na + ] c (Fig. 2b). Second, we examined NHE flux, as determined by measuring pH recovery after an acute acidic load via wash-out of NH 4 + . In control conditions, pH quickly recovered to normal values after NH 4 + wash-out. However, this recovery of pH was totally inhibited by the specific NHE inhibitor Cariporide, reflecting reduced NHE activity (Fig. 2c). In the presence of EMPA, the NHE flux was also strongly reduced by approximately 80% of the reduction observed with Cariporide (Fig. 2c). During NH 4 + application, no significant difference in pH recovery was observed between Cariporide and control (data not shown). Finally, we evaluated whether SGLTs were involved in the effects of EMPA on NHE by repeating the experiments in the absence of glucose; in glucose-free conditions, EMPA also reduced [Na + ] c (Fig. 2d) and impaired NHE flux (Fig. 2e).Empagliflozin impairs cardiac NHE activity without SGLT involvement Because the rapid action of EMPA resembled that of the NHE-inhibitor Cariporide on [Na + ] c and [Ca 2+ ] c [3], we investigated whether EMPA has NHE-inhibiting properties.

        <p>The present study demonstrates for the first time that the kidney-targeted therapeutic agent, EMPA, directly reduces myocardial intracellular Na 2+ through an interaction with the NHE, independent of cardiac SGLT inhibition. The observed decreased [Ca 2+ ] c and increased [Ca 2+ ] m are likely to have occurred secondary to the decrease in [Na + ] c via the sarcolemmal and mitochondrial Na + /Ca 2+ exchanger (NCX), respectively [6,7]. Dapagliflozin, another SGLT2 inhibitor with a slightly different chemical composition, was recently shown to reduce cell shortening after 5 min but not after 3 h of treatment. It was also found to reduce systolic but not diastolic Ca 2+ in cardiomyocytes from models of type 1 diabetes (but not in control cardiomyocytes) [8]. In comparison with dapagliflozin, the current study indicates a stronger and longer lasting effect of EMPA on cardiomyocytes. It is suggested that further research is required to compare the effects of different classes of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiomyocytes characteristics.The present study demonstrates for the first time that the kidney-targeted therapeutic agent, EMPA, directly reduces myocardial intracellular Na 2+ through an interaction with the NHE, independent of cardiac SGLT inhibition.

        <p>EMPA: cardiac NHE and SGLT2 Our observations that the effects of EMPA were independent of glucose presence is in agreement with a previous observation that SGLT2 is absent from cardiac tissue [9]. However, SGLT1 is present in the heart [9,10], potentially explaining the increase in [Na + ] c with increased circulating glucose. It was recently reported that SGLT1 within the diseased human heart is mainly localised in capillaries and not in cardiomyocytes [11]. This is in contrast with other observations that SGLT1 is localised in the T tubules of isolated cardiomyocytes [10]. In the current study, the effects of glucose on [Na + ] c were detected in isolated cardiomyocytes; therefore, it is unlikely that glucose release from the capillaries plays a role in this effect. However, further research is needed to study the role of SGLT1 within the intact heart. We used EMPA concentrations in the range of clinically measured plasma concentrations (≤1 μmol/l) [1,12], well below the IC 50 of SGLT1 (8.3 μmol/l) for EMPA [13]. Therefore, EMPA does not exert its cardiac effects through SGLT1inhibition.EMPA: cardiac NHE and SGLT2 Our observations that the effects of EMPA were independent of glucose presence is in agreement with a previous observation that SGLT2 is absent from cardiac tissue [9].

        <p>EMPA and heart failure The propensities for arrhythmias, oxidative stress and heart failure are all associated with, and at least partly driven by, intracellular cardiomyocyte Na + and Ca 2+ loading [2,3,5,6,14].

        <p>Previous studies have demonstrated that chronic inhibition of NHE prevents or mitigates heart failure in animal models [16,17]. Although clinical studies of NHE inhibition have been performed in the setting of acute coronary syndromes (and largely show a neutral effect) no clinical studies have been performed using NHE inhibition in the chronic setting of heart failure and diabetes. Therefore, these types of studies are awaited. We surmise that the beneficial cardiovascular effects of EMPA are, at least in part, attributed to NHE inhibition. However, the current results do not allow for the generation of conclusive statements about a positive or negative role on cardiac mitochondrial function following EMPA treatment. The next area that needs to be evaluated is whether EMPA does indeed result in beneficial functional cardiac effects, such as increased ATP production, oxygen consumption and/or antioxidant capacity. Whether the reductions in both cardiac [Na + ] c and [Ca 2+ ] c with EMPA treatment, and the downstream effect of elevated [Ca 2+ ] m contribute to the primary mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular benefits observed in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial needs to be examined in future research.Previous studies have demonstrated that chronic inhibition of NHE prevents or mitigates heart failure in animal models [16,17].
