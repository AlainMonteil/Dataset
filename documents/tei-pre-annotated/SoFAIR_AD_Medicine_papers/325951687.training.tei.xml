        <p>Hospital admission rates for patients with covid-19 have been difficult to estimate because rates depend on the prevalence of community testing and admission criteria, which vary between countries. However, an estimated one in 10 to one in five adults have illnesses of sufficient severity to warrant hospital admission. 4 Patients have mostly been admitted with severe acute respiratory infection or severe acute respiratory syndrome according to the previous WHO case definitions. 5 6 The provision of intensive care also varies between countries. Studies first from China, and more recently from Europe and the United States, have found rates of admission to intensive care range from 5% to 32%. 7 8 Old age, chronic major comorbidity, and male sex have consistently been associated with increased mortality.

        <p>Inclusion criteria were people of all ages who were admitted to one of 208 acute care hospitals in England, Scotland, and Wales with proven or high likelihood of infection with a pathogen of public health interest, defined as SARS-CoV-2 for this event by Public Health England. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was the only mode of testing available during the period of study. The decision to test was at the discretion of the clinician attending the patient, and not defined by protocol. The enrolment criterion "high likelihood of infection" reflects that a preparedness protocol cannot assume that a diagnostic test will be available for an emergent pathogen. Site training emphasises that only patients who tested positive for covid-19 were eligible for enrolment.Inclusion criteria were people of all ages who were admitted to one of 208 acute care hospitals in England, Scotland, and Wales with proven or high likelihood of infection with a pathogen of public health interest, defined as SARS-CoV-2 for this event by Public Health England.

        <p>National guidance was provided by Public Health England and other UK public health agencies that advised who to test based on clinical case definitions for possible covid-19 (online supplement). We also included patients who had been admitted for a separate condition but had tested positive for covid-19 during their hospital stay. We collected additional biological samples for research purposes when consent was given (please see online supplement for details of consent procedures and biological samples). These samples are currently undergoing analysis and we will present the results when they become available. Patients were only enrolled during their index admission. We used three tiers in the ISARIC WHO CCP-UK protocol. Patients in tier 0 had clinical information from their routine health records uploaded into the case report form. Consent was not required for collection of depersonalised routine healthcare data for research in England and Wales. A waiver for consent was given by the Public Benefit and Privacy Panel in Scotland. Tier 1 and 2 of the protocol involve additional biological sampling for research purposes for which consent by, or assent for, participants was obtained.National guidance was provided by Public Health England and other UK public health agencies that advised who to test based on clinical case definitions for possible covid-19 (online supplement).

        <p>We collected baseline demographic data on a paper case report form (version 9.2; supplementary material 2) that was developed by ISARIC and WHO for use in outbreak investigations. Data were uploaded from admission, and usually before hospital episodes were complete, to a REDCap database (Research Electronic Data Capture, Vanderbilt University, US, hosted by University of Oxford, UK). We aimed to record measures of illness severity and routine blood test results at a minimum of four time points: day of hospital admission (day 1), day 3, day 6, day 9, and day of any admission to critical care. We recorded relevant treatments that patients received in hospital, level of care (ward based, high dependency unit, or intensive care unit), complications, and details of discharge or death while in hospital. Further information about these variables can be found in the online supplement.We collected baseline demographic data on a paper case report form (version 9.2; supplementary material 2) that was developed by ISARIC and WHO for use in outbreak investigations.

        <p>We used several approaches to model survival. Discharge from hospital was considered an absorbing state, meaning that once discharged, patients were considered no longer at risk of death. Patients who were discharged were not censored and held within the risk set, therefore accounting for the competing risk of discharge on death. We checked this approach by using a formal Fine and Gray competing risks approach. Hierarchical Cox proportional hazards approaches included geographical region (clinical commissioning group or health board) as a random intercept. We used a parsimonious criterion based model building approach based on several principles: clinically relevant explanatory variables were identified a priori for exploration; population stratification was incorporated; interactions were checked at first order level; final model selection was informed by log likelihood tests and the concordance statistic, with appropriate assumptions checked including the distribution of residuals and requirement for proportional hazards. We set statistical significance at 5%. All tests were two sided. We analysed data by using

The most common symptom cluster encompassed the respiratory system: cough, sputum, shortness of breath, and fever. We also observed three other clusters: one encompassing musculoskeletal symptoms (myalgia, joint pain, headache, and fatigue); a cluster of enteric symptoms (abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhoea); and less commonly, a mucocutaneous cluster. Twenty nine per cent (5384/18 605) of all patients complained of enteric symptoms on admission, mostly in association with respiratory symptoms; however, 4% of all patients described enteric symptoms alone.

        <p>The pattern of disease we describe broadly reflects the pattern reported globally. 7 Patients in our study had a higher median age and higher rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma than patients in China 8 and the US. 11 12 The prevalence of obesity in our study (11%) was considerably lower than the overall UK prevalence (29%). 13 This proportion could reflect the relatively elderly male population admitted to hospital and misclassification or under reporting by admitting physicians. Our patients presented with a relatively short time interval between onset of symptoms and admission to hospital, which might also be a function of the older and vulnerable patient population.The pattern of disease we describe broadly reflects the pattern reported globally. 7 Patients in our study had a higher median age and higher rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma than patients in China 8 and the US. 11 12 The prevalence of obesity in our study (11%) was considerably lower than the overall UK prevalence (29%). 13 This proportion could reflect the relatively elderly male population admitted to hospital and misclassification or under reporting by admitting physicians.

        <p>The current case definition of cough and fever, if strictly applied, would miss 7% of our inpatients. A smaller proportion, 4% of patients, presented with enteric symptoms only. This figure could be an underestimate because these patients fall outside standard criteria for testing. This enteric presentation risks misclassification of patients, and assignment to non-covid-19 care areas, which could pose a nosocomial transmission risk. Severe SARS-CoV-2 infections are rare in people younger than 18 years, comprising only 1.5% of those admitted to hospital. Only 1.0% of those in our study were younger than 5 years. The J shaped age distribution is starkly different to the U shaped age distribution seen in seasonal influenza and the W shaped distribution observed in the 2009 influenza pandemic. 14 The reason why SARS-CoV-19 has mostly spared children is not clear, but we speculate this could be because angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptors are expressed differently in younger lungs. Other studies have not widely reported that obesity as recognised by clinical staff is associated with mortality in hospital after adjustment for other comorbidities, age, and sex. Obesity was recognised as a risk factor in the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic, but not for the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. 15 16 The proportion of pregnant women in our cohort was small (10%), similar to the estimated proportion of pregnant women in the community. 15 Pregnancy was not associated with mortality, in apparent contrast to influenza. 17 comparison with other studies The proportion of patients admitted to critical care in our study was similar to that reported in Italy (17%), 18 19 and New York (14.2%), 11 12 but higher than China. 8 At the time of enrolment, the Intensive Care Society had issued guidance to its members that there would be no rationing of critical care admission until all capacity in the country had been exhausted. As far as we are aware, critical care capacity was not exceeded in the UK during the period of the study. We do not believe that any equipment shortages existed during this period that might have prompted more aggressive futility discussions.The current case definition of cough and fever, if strictly applied, would miss 7% of our inpatients.

The J shaped age distribution is starkly different to the U shaped age distribution seen in seasonal influenza and the W shaped distribution observed in the 2009 influenza pandemic. 14 The reason why SARS-CoV-19 has mostly spared children is not clear, but we speculate this could be because angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptors are expressed differently in younger lungs. Other studies have not widely reported that obesity as recognised by clinical staff is associated with mortality in hospital after adjustment for other comorbidities, age, and sex. Obesity was recognised as a risk factor in the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic, but not for the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. 15 16 The proportion of pregnant women in our cohort was small (10%), similar to the estimated proportion of pregnant women in the community. 15 Pregnancy was not associated with mortality, in apparent contrast to influenza. 17 comparison with other studies The proportion of patients admitted to critical care in our study was similar to that reported in Italy (17%), 18 19 and New York (14.2%), 11 12 but higher than China. 8 At the time of enrolment, the Intensive Care Society had issued guidance to its members that there would be no rationing of critical care admission until all capacity in the country had been exhausted. As far as we are aware, critical care capacity was not exceeded in the UK during the period of the study. We do not believe that any equipment shortages existed during this period that might have prompted more aggressive futility discussions.</p>
        <p>Mortality in our cohort was high in patients admitted to general wards who were not admitted to critical care, which suggests that advanced care planning occurred. We were unable to capture treatment limiting decisions about level of care. The high median age of patients who died in the cohort (80 years) could partly explain the high mortality rate. Mortality rates were extremely high for patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit compared with the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic, for which mortality in intensive care was 31%. 15 Our data were in line with the initial ICNARC (intensive care national audit and research centre) audit reports, which represent intensive care units in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. 20 Outcome analyses only included patients who were admitted before 19 April to allow most patients to complete their hospital admission. However, an inherent reporting bias exists because the sickest of patients, particularly those admitted to intensive care, have the longest hospital stays; mortality rates in hospital could therefore increase. These mortality rates were considerably higher than the 24% mortality rate in hospital seen in patients in intensive care units in Italy 19 and the US. 11 12 The lower rate in the US could in part be explained by differences in healthcare systems and the proportion of intensive care unit beds to hospital beds between the two countries. In Italy, a lower proportion of patients received mechanical ventilation, and most of their patients (72%) remained in hospital at the time of the analysis. 19 The finding of independent associations of advancing age, male sex, chronic respiratory (nonasthmatic) disease, chronic cardiac disease, and chronic neurological disease with mortality in hospital is in line with early international reports. 9 10 However, although age adjusted mortality rates are high in elderly patients, most of these patients were admitted to hospital with symptoms of covid-19 and would not have been in hospital otherwise. Enhanced severity in male patients was seen across all ages.Mortality in our cohort was high in patients admitted to general wards who were not admitted to critical care, which suggests that advanced care planning occurred.

        <p>Our study has some limitations. We do not currently have data on the inpatients that were not enrolled, or people managed in community settings, such as usual domestic residences and older people's care homes. We are unable to comment on community risk factors that drive hospital admission except by inference from expected representation at admission. We will be linking to routine administrative healthcare datasets which will enable us to assess the presence of any selection bias.Our study has some limitations.

        <p>A large amount of data were missing and we suggest there are two main reasons for this. Firstly, enrolment occurred in the nonlinear growth phase of the outbreak, and outcomes for recent admissions have not been reported yet; these admissions account for 18% of the total number of patients enrolled. Secondly, the research network was dealing with unprecedented numbers of patients at a time when many were seconded to clinical practice or themselves off sick. This study is ongoing, and further data are being added to case report forms.A large amount of data were missing and we suggest there are two main reasons for this.

        <p>We suggest it is possible that the sickest patients were enrolled in our study, and this could partly explain our high mortality rates in hospital.

        <p>This large and rapidly conducted study of patients admitted to hospital in England, Wales, and Scotland with covid-19 shows the importance of putting plans in place for the study of epidemic and pandemic threats, and the need to maintain these plans. Our study identifies sectors of the population that are at greatest risk of a poor outcome, and reports the use of healthcare resources. Most patients with covid-19 experience mild disease. However, in our cohort, of those who were admitted to hospital two weeks before data extraction, less than half have been discharged alive and a quarter have died. The remainder continued to receive care at the date of reporting. Seventeen percent of patients admitted to hospital required critical care. Factors associated with mortality in hospital were increasing age, male sex, obesity, and major comorbidities.This large and rapidly conducted study of patients admitted to hospital in England, Wales, and Scotland with covid-19 shows the importance of putting plans in place for the study of epidemic and pandemic threats, and the need to maintain these plans.
