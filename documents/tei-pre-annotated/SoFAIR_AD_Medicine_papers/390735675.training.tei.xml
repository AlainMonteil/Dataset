        <p>The receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer are key neutralization targets and potent RBD-specific antibodies have been isolated from many convalescent donors (Brouwer et al., 2020;Cao et al., 2020;Chen et al., 2020;Chi et al., 2020;Hansen et al., 2020;Ju et al., 2020;Kreer et al., 2020;Robbiani et al., 2020;Rogers et al., 2020;Seydoux et al., 2020;Shi et al., 2020;Wec et al., 2020;Wu et al., 2020b;Zost et al., 2020). Indeed, such antibodies are used for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Chen et al., 2021;Weinreich et al., 2021). Typically, RBD-specific neutralizing antibodies isolated during early convalescence have low levels of somatic hypermutation and nearly identical antibodies derived from specific rearranged antibody genes (e.g., VH3-53/VH3-63) (Barnes et al., 2020c;Robbiani et al., 2020;Yuan et al., 2020) are found in distinct convalescent or vaccinated individuals (Wang et al., 2021). Consistent with these findings, high titer neutralizing sera are generated following administration of at least some SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (Sahin et al., 2020;Widge et al., 2021). Conversely, SARS-CoV-2 infection may sometimes fail to induce sufficient B-cell stimulation and expansion to generate high neutralizing antibody titers. Indeed, neutralizing titers are low in some convalescent individuals, including those from whom commonly elicited potent antibodies can be cloned (Luchsinger et al., 2020;Robbiani et al., 2020;Wu et al., 2020a).The receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer are key neutralization targets and potent RBD-specific antibodies have been isolated from many convalescent donors (Brouwer et al., 2020;Cao et al., 2020;Chen et al., 2020;Chi et al., 2020;Hansen et al., 2020;Ju et al., 2020;Kreer et al., 2020;Robbiani et al., 2020;Rogers et al., 2020;Seydoux et al., 2020;Shi et al., 2020;Wec et al., 2020;Wu et al., 2020b;Zost et al., 2020).

        <p>The RBD exhibits flexibility and binds the ACE2 receptor only in an "up" conformation, not in the "down" RBD conformation of the closed, prefusion trimer (Walls et al., 2020;Wrapp et al., 2020). Structural studies have allowed designation of distinct RBD-binding antibody structural classes (Barnes et al., 2020b). Class 1 antibodies are derived from VH3-53 or VH3-63 gene segments, include short CDRH3s, and recognize the ACE2 binding site on RBDs in an "up" conformation (Barnes et al., 2020b;Barnes et al., 2020c;Hurlburt et al., 2020;Shi et al., 2020;Wu et al., 2020c;Yuan et al., 2020). Class 2 antibodies are derived from a variety of VH gene segments, also target the ACE2 binding site, but can bind to RBDs in either an "up" or "down" conformation. Some class 2 antibodies, e.g., C144 and S2M11 (Barnes et al., 2020b;Tortorici et al., 2020), bridge adjacent "down" RBDs to lock the spike trimer into a closed prefusion conformation. Class 3 antibodies, which can recognize "up" or "down" RBDs, do not target the ACE2 binding site (Barnes et al., 2020b).The RBD exhibits flexibility and binds the ACE2 receptor only in an "up" conformation, not in the "down" RBD conformation of the closed, prefusion trimer (Walls et al., 2020;Wrapp et al., 2020).

        <p>Despite the fact that cloned RBD-specific antibodies can select resistance mutations, such as E484K, in cell culture (Baum et al., 2020;Weisblum et al., 2020), until recently, little evidence had emerged that antibodies have imposed selective pressure on circulating SARS-CoV-2 populations. Nevertheless, variability and decay of convalescent neutralizing titers, (Gaebler et al., 2021;Luchsinger et al., 2020;Muecksch et al., 2020;Robbiani et al., 2020;Seow et al., 2020), suggests that reinfection by SARS-CoV-2 may occur at some frequency.Despite the fact that cloned RBD-specific antibodies can select resistance mutations, such as E484K, in cell culture (Baum et al., 2020;Weisblum et al., 2020), until recently, little evidence had emerged that antibodies have imposed selective pressure on circulating SARS-CoV-2 populations.

        <p>Indeed, recent reports have documented reinfection or rapidly increasing case numbers, associated with SARS-CoV-2 variants with resistance to commonly elicited antibodies (Fujino et al., 2021;Tegally et al., 2020;Volz et al., 2021;Wang et al., 2021;West et al., 2021;Wibmer et al., 2021).Indeed, recent reports have documented reinfection or rapidly increasing case numbers, associated with SARS-CoV-2 variants with resistance to commonly elicited antibodies (Fujino et al., 2021;Tegally et al., 2020;Volz et al., 2021;Wang et al., 2021;West et al., 2021;Wibmer et al., 2021).</p>

        <p>However, recent work has shown that antibodies evolve in convalescent patients, accumulating somatic mutations that can affect function (Gaebler et al., 2021;Sakharkar et al., 2021;Sokal et al., 2021). Here, we present a detailed functional and structural characterization of several groups of clonally-related antibodies recovered from the same individuals shortly after infection and then later in convalescence. We show that somatic mutations acquired in the months after infection endow some SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibodies with greater neutralization potency and breadth. Most importantly, the acquisition of somatic mutations provides some antibodies with resilience to viral mutations that would otherwise enable SARS-CoV-2 to escape their neutralizing effects.However, recent work has shown that antibodies evolve in convalescent patients, accumulating somatic mutations that can affect function (Gaebler et al., 2021;Sakharkar et al., 2021;Sokal et al., 2021).

        <p>To determine the functional consequences of antibody maturation in SARS-CoV-2 convalescence, we compared clonally-related antibodies, from six lineages (Table S1), isolated at a mean of 1.3 or 6.2 months (m) after PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection from patients with mild to moderately severe disease (Gaebler et al., 2021;Robbiani et al., 2020). We measured neutralization potency against a panel of HIV-1 SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes bearing single amino acid substitutions that are naturally occurring or known to confer resistance to neutralization by individual human antibodies or plasma (Weisblum et al., 2020). Additionally, to determine the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 spike to acquire mutations conferring resistance to the antibodies, we employed a pair of replication-competent chimeric VSV derivatives (rVSV/SARS-CoV-21D7 / 2E1) (Schmidt et al., 2020;Weisblum et al., 2020) to select antibody escape variants.To determine the functional consequences of antibody maturation in SARS-CoV-2 convalescence, we compared clonally-related antibodies, from six lineages (Table S1), isolated at a mean of 1.3 or 6.2 months (m) after PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection from patients with mild to moderately severe disease (Gaebler et al., 2021;Robbiani et al., 2020).

        <p>Class 2 anti-RBD antibodies are commonly elicited and recognize an epitope that includes E484 (Barnes et al., 2020b), a site that is mutated in certain circulating SARS-CoV-2 'variants of concern' (Fujino et al., 2021;West et al., 2021;Wibmer et al., 2021). We examined members of three class 2 antibody lineages.Class 2 anti-RBD antibodies are commonly elicited and recognize an epitope that includes E484 (Barnes et al., 2020b), a site that is mutated in certain circulating SARS-CoV-2 'variants of concern' (Fujino et al., 2021;West et al., 2021;Wibmer et al., 2021). We examined members of three class 2 antibody lineages.</p>
        <p>One group of class 2, VH3-53/VL2-14-encoded antibodies included C144, a potent neutralizing antibody (IC50 &lt;10ng/ml) isolated at 1.3m of convalescence (Robbiani et al., 2020) that is in clinical development for therapy/prophylaxis. Two clonally-related antibodies isolated from the C144 donor at 6.2m included C051, which was marginally less potent (IC50 ~25ng/ml), and C052, which had similar potency to C144 (Gaebler et al., 2021). SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype neutralization assay revealed that several RBD substitutions at positions L455, F456, E484, F490, Q493 and S494, which conferred C144 resistance (Figure1A, B), had no effect C051 and C052 sensitivity. Some, but not all, naturally occurring E484 substitutions that conferred C144 resistance also conferred resistance to C051 and/or C052. Selection for rVSV/SARS-CoV-2 resistance mutations using C144 gave enrichment of multiple substitutions at two positions; E484K/A/G and Q493R/K (Figure 1C), and plaque purification from selected virus populations yielded isolates with E484K or Q493R substitutions that confer high level C144 resistance (Weisblum et al., 2020) (Figure S1A). Conversely, rVSV/SARS-CoV-2 replication in the presence of C051 and C052 led to the dominance of the E484K mutant only, and rVSV/SARS-CoV-2 isolates bearing E484K substitutions were resistant to C051 and C052 (Figure 1C, S1). Thus, in this lineage of potently neutralizing antibodies elicited early after infection somatic mutation conferred resilience to a subset of naturally occurring potential escape variants. Nevertheless, resistance to each of the antibodies in this commonly elicited lineage was conferred by E484K (Figure 1A,B, Figure S1).One group of class 2, VH3-53/VL2-14-encoded antibodies included C144, a potent neutralizing antibody (IC50 &lt;10ng/ml) isolated at 1.3m of convalescence (Robbiani et al., 2020) that is in clinical development for therapy/prophylaxis.

        <p>A second clonally-related antibody lineage, encoded by VH3-66/VL2-33, included C143 and C164, isolated at 1.3m and C055, isolated at 6.2m, were from the same individual as the C144 lineage (Gaebler et al., 2021;Robbiani et al., 2020). C143 and C164 had weak neutralizing activity (IC50 values ~300ng/ml to &gt;625ng/ml) against the HIV-1 pseudotype panel (Figure S2A).A second clonally-related antibody lineage, encoded by VH3-66/VL2-33, included C143 and C164, isolated at 1.3m and C055, isolated at 6.2m, were from the same individual as the C144 lineage (Gaebler et al., 2021;Robbiani et al., 2020). C143 and C164 had weak neutralizing activity (IC50 values ~300ng/ml to &gt;625ng/ml) against the HIV-1 pseudotype panel (Figure S2A).</p>
        <p>Conversely, C055 potently neutralized the majority of SARS-CoV-2 spike variant pseudotypes (IC50 values of ~10ng/ml) (Figure S2A). Naturally occurring spike substitutions (at positions A475, T478, E484, G485, and F486) caused loss of C055 potency (Figure S2A), indicating a target epitope close to that of the C144/C051/C052 lineage. Despite their modest potency, rVSV/SARS-CoV-2 replication with C143 or C164 led to the enrichment of T478K/R mutations, and a plaque purified T478R mutant isolate exhibited near-complete resistance to C143 and C164 while an E484K mutant exhibited partial resistance (Figure S2B,C). Conversely rVSV/SARS-CoV-2 selection with C055 yielded G485S/D and F486V/S, substitutions and isolates with G485S, F486S and F486V mutations exhibited near complete resistance to C055 (Figure S2B,D). Overall, maturation of this antibody lineage yielded both greater potency and a change in the selected spike substitutions that yielded neutralization escape (Figure S2B).Conversely, C055 potently neutralized the majority of SARS-CoV-2 spike variant pseudotypes (IC50 values of ~10ng/ml) (Figure S2A).

        <p>A third class 2 antibody lineage, encoded by VH1-69/VL9-49, included C548, isolated at 1.3m, and C549, isolated at 6.2m (Gaebler et al., 2021;Robbiani et al., 2020). C548 was somewhat less potent (IC50 ~50ng/ml) than C549 (IC50 ~15ng/ml). Similar to C144, naturally occurring substitutions at positions L455, F456, E484, S494, Y489, Q493 and S494 caused near complete loss of C548 potency (Figure 1D). Remarkably, however, C549 potency was unaffected or only marginally affected by most of these mutations. E484K conferred partial (~50-100-fold) resistance (Figure 1D). Selection experiments with C548 led to rapid enrichment of E484K and Q493K C548-resistant rVSV/SARS-CoV-2mutants (Figure 1E, F), consistent with the finding that E484K or Q493R substitutions conferred C548 resistance in the HIV-1 pseudotype assay. In contrast, initial attempts to select C549-resistant rVSV/SARS-CoV-2 mutants failed (Figure 1E). However, by reducing the selecting concentration of C549 and sequential passaging with antibody four times, we obtained rVSV/SARS-CoV-2 populations in which Y449H, E484K, F486L and F490P/S mutations were enriched (Figure 1E). Notably, these selected populations yielded only isolates that encoded two RBD substitutions; one Y449H/E484K and the other F486L/F490P. These viruses exhibited greater (1000-fold), C549resistance than the E484K single mutant (Figure 1G,Fig S3). Because individual substitutions at E484, F486, and F490 caused only partial or no C549 resistance (Fig 1D,G Figure S3), these data suggest that at least two substitutions are required to confer high-level resistance to C549. Thus, for this pair of antibodies, antibody maturation appeared to heighten the genetic barrier for the acquisition of antibody resistance.A third class 2 antibody lineage, encoded by VH1-69/VL9-49, included C548, isolated at 1.3m, and C549, isolated at 6.2m (Gaebler et al., 2021;Robbiani et al., 2020).

        <p>A fourth antibody lineage, encoded by VH3-53/VK3-20 genes, also exhibited striking disparity in activity and breadth when 1.3m and 6.2m clonal relatives were compared. Specifically C098, isolated at 1.3m, displayed minimal activity (IC50 &gt; 1000ng/ml) against most SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes while a clonal relative isolated at 6.2m, C099 had IC50 values ranging from ~15-48 ng/ml for all variants except L455R, for which the IC50 was increased to 123ng/ml (Figure 2A, B). In rVSV/SARS-CoV-2 selection experiments, the low potency of C098 was reflected in the modest enrichment of mutations. Nevertheless, there was some enrichment of N460 substitutions (Figure 2B, C), and after two passages, rVSV/SARS-CoV-2 (N460Y) mutant was isolated which displayed nearly complete C098 resistance (Figure 2D). Initial attempts to isolate C099-resistant rVSV/SARS-CoV-2 mutants failed. However, passaging rVSV/SARS-CoV-2 four times with reduced C099 concentrations, yielded populations enriched most prominently in D420Y, Y453H, and L455R substitutions (Figure 2 B,C). Plaque purification yielded D420Y, N460Y, or L455R single mutants with partial (10-fold or less) C099 resistance (Figure 2B, E F) as well as D420Y/N460H and L455R/Y453H double mutants with higher levels of C099-resistance (~100-fold, Figure 2E,F). Analysis of HIV-1 pseudotypes with these mutations confirmed that D420Y, N460H, L455R and Y453H alone each abolished the weak C098 neutralization activity but conferred no or partial C099-resistance to (Figure S4A,B).A fourth antibody lineage, encoded by VH3-53/VK3-20 genes, also exhibited striking disparity in activity and breadth when 1.3m and 6.2m clonal relatives were compared.

        <p>The VH4-4/VL2-14 encoded C132 antibody, isolated at 1.3m, had weak neutralizing activity against the spike variants in the HIV-1 pseudotype assay while its 6.2m clonal derivative, C512, was quite potent, (IC50 ~100ng/ml, Figure 3A). Substitutions at R346, K444 and G446 conferred C512 resistance (Figure 3A,B). Despite its poor potency, rVSV/SARS-2/EGFP replication with C132 generated viral populations enriched for R346 substitutions, and a plaque purified rVSV/SARS-2/EGFP (R346K) mutant that was resistant to the weak activity of C132 (Fig 3B,C,D). In contrast, and despite the fact that R346, K444 and G446 substitutions all conferred resistance in the HIV-1 assay, C512 selected resistant rVSV/SARS-2/EGFP variants with K444 substitutions only (Figure 3C,D).

Like some other class 3 antibodies, C032 and C080 exhibited incomplete neutralization complicating selection of rVSV/SARS-CoV-2 resistant variants. Nevertheless, C032 enriched N440 and L441 substitutions, both of which conferred C032 resistance (Figure 3G).

        <p>Selection for rVSV/SARS-CoV-2 resistance to class 1, 2 and 3 antibodies in cell culture has repeatedly identified K417, E484 and N501 substitutions, with E484K giving the most pervasive effects against polyclonal plasma (Baum et al., 2020;Greaney et al., 2021;Liu et al., 2021;Wang et al., 2021;Weisblum et al., 2020). We compared the ability of the antibodies studied herein to neutralize pseudotypes with a E484K substitution alone, or in combination with K417N and N501Y substitutions that naturally occur in variants of concern (Fujino et al., 2021;Wibmer et al., 2021) or in combination with L455R, a mutation that affected neutralization by multiple class 1 and class 2 antibodies (Figure 1, Figure 2). The activity of the C144/C051/C052 and C143/C162/C055 class 2 lineages was diminished by the E484K substitution, and there was little scope for additional mutations to further reduce potency (Figure 4A,B). Conversely, while the 1.3m class 2 antibody C548 was inactive against the E484K mutant, its descendent C549 retained partial activity (Figure 4C). C549 activity was modestly further reduced by the K417N/E484K/N501Y combination and abolished by the L455R/E484K combination (Figure 4C), consistent with the notion that 2 substitutions were required to confer maximal C549 escape (Figure 2E, F, Figure S3). The C098/C099 class 1 antibodies were not affected by the E484K mutation or the K417N/E484K/N501Y combination (Figure 4D). The partial loss of potency against the L455R/E484K combination was largely consistent with that seen for the L455R single mutant (Figure S4B). As expected, K417/E484K/N501Y and L455R/E484K mutations did not confer resistance to the class 3 antibodies. In fact, unexpectedly, these mutations sensitized the pseudotypes to neutralization by some class 3 antibodies (Figure 4D).

We also determined structures of 1.3m class 2 (C548) and 1.3m class 3 (C032) Fabs bound to S, allowing modeling of RBD interactions for their 6.2m counterparts (C549 and C080, respectively). Across these structures, most substitutions found at 6.2m post-infection occurred in CDR loops, in or adjacent to antibody paratopes (Figure 6,7, Figure S6,7).We investigated the effects of somatic mutations on antibody-antigen interactions by solving structures of 1.3m and 6.2m pairs of class 1 (C098/C099) and class 2 (C144/C051) antibody Fab fragments bound to SARS-CoV-2 spike trimers or monomeric RBDs (Figure S5 and Tables S2,3).

For antibody pairs for which we had determined both 1.3m and 6.2m structures, Sc values for 6.2m antibodies were modestly increased compared with their 1.3m counterparts: 0.56 versus 0.52 for C051 and C144 complexes with Spike, respectively (Sc values calculated for a Fab complexed with two adjacent RBDs), and 0.73 and 0.68 for C099 and C098 Fab complexes with RBD, respectively.To derive global properties of Fab-antigen interactions, we calculated shape complementarity (Sc) indices, which vary from 0 (not complementary) to 1 (a perfect fit) and are typically 0.64-0.68 for antibody-antigen interfaces (Lawrence and Colman, 1993).

        <p>To understand the influence of individual mutations on potency and viral escape, we aligned RBD-bound Fab complexes from clonally-related 1.3m and 6.2m antibodies and inspected residue-level antibody-antigen interactions (Figure 6 and Figure S6).

After superimposing the RBDs, the Fab VH-VL domains adopted the same binding pose such that the CDR loops at the Fab-RBD interface were aligned equivalently (Figure 6A,B). Overall, the footprints of the epitope on the RBD and the paratope on the Fab were conserved (Figure S6A-C), consistent with the highly similar binding orientations of class 1 anti-RBD neutralizing antibodies (Figure S6D).To understand the influence of individual mutations on potency and viral escape, we aligned RBD-bound Fab complexes from clonally-related 1.3m and 6.2m antibodies and inspected residue-level antibody-antigen interactions (Figure 6 and Figure S6).

        <p>Somatic mutations in C099 occurred in V gene-encoded CDR loops and FWRs, while the CDR3 loops remained unchanged from the germline (C098) antibody (Figure S6A,E). As previously noted for class 1 anti-RBD neutralizing antibodies (Hurlburt et al., 2020;Tan et al., 2021) somatic mutations in C099's CDRH1 and CDRH2 appeared to drive improved binding and neutralizing characteristics. For example, the F27IHC mutation found in C099 introduces a smaller hydrophobic residue that likely makes the CDRH1 loop more flexible, facilitating increased polar contacts and van der Waals interactions in this region (Figure 6C,D).Somatic mutations in C099 occurred in V gene-encoded CDR loops and FWRs, while the CDR3 loops remained unchanged from the germline (C098) antibody (Figure S6A,E).

The C144 and C051 Fabs associate with the RBD through a similar binding mode to bridge adjacent RBDs on the surface of the S trimer (Figure 6H).

        <p>Mutations at RBD positions L455, F456, E484, and Q493 conferred escape from C144, while only the E484K mutation conferred escape from C051 (Figure 1A). Viral escape at RBD positions L455 and Q493 is facilitated by an arginine substitution that would disrupt hydrogenbonding networks at the C144-RBD interface (Figure 6I). Somatic mutations in the C051 CDRH1 (T28GHC and S30RHC) introduce new polar contacts with backbone carbonyl and side chain residues at the RBD interface, while allowing additional flexibility in CDRH1 (Figure 6J), similar to observations for class 1 antibodies (Figure 6D). In addition, the CDRH3 E97DHC somatic mutation in C051 introduces a smaller charged residue that may better accommodate an arginine side chain in this region (Figure 6J). Somatic hypermutations in CDRH1 for this lineage likely play an important role, as the clonally-related C054 antibody isolated at 6.2m is sensitive to the Q493R and L455R mutations (Gaebler et al., 2021).Mutations at RBD positions L455, F456, E484, and Q493 conferred escape from C144, while only the E484K mutation conferred escape from C051 (Figure 1A).

        <p>To further understand escape patterns of RBD-targeting antibodies, we determined cryo-EM structures of Fab-S complexes for 1.3m class 2 (C548) and class 3 (C032) neutralizing antibodies (Figure 7 and Figure S5) and derived homology models of the 6.2m counterparts: C549 and C080, respectively (Figure S7). In both experimentally-determined structures, Fabs recognized either "up" or "down" RBD conformations (Figure 7). The 3.4 Å cryo-EM structure of C548 Fabs bound to a closed S trimer (Figure 7A) revealed a quaternary epitope that spanned neighboring RBDs (Figure 7B,C). The antibody paratope involved five of six CDR loops, with the majority of contacts to RBD focused on residues involved in ACE2 recognition (Figure 7D and Figure S7). C548 is encoded by the VH1-69 VH gene segment, which encodes a hydrophobic sequence at the tip of CDRH2 that has been shown to facilitate broad neutralization against influenza, Hepatitis C, and HIV-1 (Chen et al., 2019). In C548, residues I53-F54HC target a hydrophobic patch in the neighboring RBD core that resides near the base of the N343-glycan and comprises RBD residues W436, N440, and L441 (Figure 7D,E). These interactions are akin to those observed in the C144/C051 lineage, in which either Phe-Trp or Leu-Trp at the tip of CDRH3 is buried in a similar manner on the adjacent RBD (Figure S6G,H). These data demonstrate convergent evolution of mechanisms for anti-RBD antibodies to target this hydrophobic patch on the RBD surface, with the potential to lock RBDs into the "down" position.To further understand escape patterns of RBD-targeting antibodies, we determined cryo-EM structures of Fab-S complexes for 1.3m class 2 (C548) and class 3 (C032) neutralizing antibodies (Figure 7 and Figure S5) and derived homology models of the 6.2m counterparts: C549 and C080, respectively (Figure S7).

        <p>Viral escape from C548 was mediated by substitutions at positions L455, E484, F490 and Q493, likely due to the disruption of polar contacts at the RBD interface and/or insertion of bulky sidechains into a sterically-restricted region (Figure 7F). However, unlike the C144/C051 lineage, C549 (the 6.2m mature counterpart) shows resilience to all C548 viral escape mutants, including partial resilience to the E484K substitution (Figure 1D). C549 exhibits accumulated somatic mutations (9 HC residues and 11 LC residues changed compared to germline) in both FWR and CDR loops (Figure S7A). Using the C548-S structure, we made a homology model of the C549-RBD interactions (Figure S7B). Light chain somatic mutations are predicted to explain the increased resistance: 30YLC provides additional stacking interactions with RBD residue F490, while 27DLC and 92ELC increase polar contacts with RBD backbone carbonyl and side chain atoms (Figure S7C). Thus, we predict that C549 partial resilience to the E484K mutation is not the result in changes in direct interactions with the E484 sidechain, but rather a series of adjacent residue changes to accommodate the E484K substitution.Viral escape from C548 was mediated by substitutions at positions L455, E484, F490 and Q493, likely due to the disruption of polar contacts at the RBD interface and/or insertion of bulky sidechains into a sterically-restricted region (Figure 7F).

        <p>To understand maturation in the C032/C080 class 3 antibody lineage, we determined a 3.3 Å cryo-EM structure of a C032-S trimer complex, revealing a Fab binding orientation that does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site (Figure 7G,H). C032 recognizes a glycopeptidic epitope focused on a short helical segment in the RBD core that spans RBD residues 437-442 near the N343-glycan (Figure 7I), with a paratope BSA (~810 Å 2 ) equally distributed among the CDRH1, CDRH2, CDRH3, and CDRL3 loops (Figure 7J and Figure S7A). At the tip of CDRH3, hydrophobic residues A97HC, V98HC, and W100HC bury into a pocket shaped by RBD loops comprising residues 344-348 and 443-450 (Figure 7K), providing sequence-independent van der Waals interactions with the RBD backbone. Mutation of residues comprising this RBD pocket confer C032-resistance (Figure 3E). To predict how the affinity matured 6.2m antibody, C080, avoids viral escape, we made a homology model of the C080-RBD structure. The majority of somatic mutations in C080 are positioned distal to the modeled Fab-RBD interface (Figure S7D). Thus, it is likely that C080 somatic mutations influence CDR loop conformation and flexibility at the antigen interface, as has been observed for neutralizing antibodies against the HIV-1 Envelope (Klein et al., 2013). Interestingly, C080 also acquired activity against SARS-CoV (Figure 5F). Based on the homology model of C080-SARS-CoV RBD, CDRL3 mutations are predicted to facilitate recognition of the SARS-CoV RBD (Figure S7E).To understand maturation in the C032/C080 class 3 antibody lineage, we determined a 3.3 Å cryo-EM structure of a C032-S trimer complex, revealing a Fab binding orientation that does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site (Figure 7G,H).

        <p>Herein we describe properties of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies that change as a consequence accumulated somatic mutations in convalescent individuals (Gaebler et al., 2021;Sokal et al., 2021). Persistent somatic mutation is associated with continued availability of antigen (Victora and Nussenzweig, 2012). For example, during chronic HIV-1 infection, antibodies develop exceptionally large numbers of mutations compared to infections of limited duration (Klein et al., 2013;Scheid et al., 2009). In SARS-CoV-2 convalescent individuals, viral proteins and nucleic acids can persist in the gut for months, providing a source of antigen to fuel germinal centers (Gaebler et al., 2021). Whether current vaccination schemes will afford a sufficient antigen persistence to elicit continued antibody maturation remains to be determined.Herein we describe properties of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies that change as a consequence accumulated somatic mutations in convalescent individuals (Gaebler et al., 2021;Sokal et al., 2021).

        <p>While each antibody lineage had unique characteristics that were impacted by somatic mutations, general themes were evident. Typically, antibodies isolated at 6.2m had increased potency compared to their clonal relatives isolated at 1.3m. An exception to this was C144, a particularly potent antibody, isolated at 1.3m, (Robbiani et al., 2020). Structural analysis suggests that the high potency of C144 is related to its ability to lock the S trimer in a prefusion, closed state (Barnes et al., 2020b).While each antibody lineage had unique characteristics that were impacted by somatic mutations, general themes were evident.

        <p>Whereas antibody producing plasma cells are selected based on their affinity for antigen, memory B-cells are heterogeneous and encode a far more diverse set of antibodies with varying levels of affinity for the immunogen (Viant et al., 2020). One of the consequences of accumulating a diverse group of closely related antibody-producing cells in the memory compartment is the ability to recognize and respond to closely related pathogens (Viant et al., 2020). Consistent with this observation, an important property that was recurrently evident in the antibody lineages described herein was a change in the mutations that were selected and conferred resistance to 6.2m antibodies as compared to 1.3m antibodies. Striking features of some of the 6.2m antibodies included restriction of the range of options for viral escape and the resilience of neutralization activity in the face of point mutations that conferred resistance to 1.3m antibodies. Indeed, the neutralization potency of certain matured antibodies, such as C549, C099 and C080, was maintained for all of the naturally circulating individual RBD substitutions tested, consistent with observation of antibody antigen structures or models. In some cases, rVSV/SARS-CoV-2 selection experiments indicated that somatic mutations elevated the genetic barrier to antibody resistance, imposing a requirement for two substitutions for high level antibody resistance.Whereas antibody producing plasma cells are selected based on their affinity for antigen, memory B-cells are heterogeneous and encode a far more diverse set of antibodies with varying levels of affinity for the immunogen (Viant et al., 2020).

        <p>The naturally circulating RBD triple mutant K417N/E484K/N501Y did not generally confer resistance to antibodies that were not already affected by the E484K mutation. This finding suggests that separate antibodies may be generally responsible for the application of selection pressure at K417, E484 and N501. Nevertheless, the E484K mutation undermined the activity of several class 2 antibodies. While a number of naturally circulating substitutions at E484 conferred resistance to some class 2 antibodies (e.g., C144, C055, C548), naturally occurring variants of concern typically encode E484K (West et al., 2021), consistent with our finding that only the E484K substitution conferred more pervasive class 2 antibody resistance, including to some matured antibodies (e.g., C051, C052).The naturally circulating RBD triple mutant K417N/E484K/N501Y did not generally confer resistance to antibodies that were not already affected by the E484K mutation.

        <p>In two cases, antibody maturation enabled neutralization of heterologous sarbecoviruses, suggesting that development of pan-sarbecovirus vaccines may be possible (Cohen et al., 2021b). Indeed, the greater neutralization potency, resilience to viral mutation, and breadth of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibodies that have undergone greater degrees of somatic mutation suggests that immunization schemes that elicit higher levels of antibody mutation and diversification are desirable. Indeed, antibody maturation may be especially important as SARS-CoV-2 diversifies and adapts to the range of human antibodies in vaccinated and previously infected individuals. Moreover, a diverse set of broadly neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 spike-elicited antibodies that exhibit some activity against divergent sarbecoviruses may mitigate the threat posed by this group of pandemic-threat agents.

        <p>We have previously described a panel of plasmids expressing RBD-mutant SAR-CoV-2 spike proteins in the context of pSARS-CoV-2-SΔ19 (Weisblum et al., 2020). Additional substitutions to expend the panel were introduced using synthetic gene fragments (IDT) or overlap extension PCR mediated mutagenesis and Gibson assembly. E484K was originally excluded from our panel because HIV-1-based pseudotypes generated with the E484K substitution in our standard assay were poorly infectious. However, when the E484K substitution was incorporated into a spike protein that also includes that the R683G substitution, which disrupts the furin cleavage site, pseudotyped particle infectivity was preserved. The R683G substitution itself increased pseudovirus sensitivity to some antibodies, including C055, C099, C549 and C512, and antibodies from the C144 and C032 groups. Thus, the E484K, L455R+E484K and KEN (K417N+E484K+N501Y) mutants were used in the context of a pSARS-CoV-2-S Δ19 variant with an inactivated furin cleavage site (R683G). The potencies with which the antibodies neutralized members of the mutant pseudotype panel were compared with potencies against a "wildtype" SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512) spike sequence, carrying R683G where appropriate. The SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped HIV-1 particles were generated as previously described (Schmidt et al., 2020).

        <p>We followed previously-described cryo-EM data collection and processing protocols for Fab-S complexes (Barnes et al., 2020a). Briefly, for all Fab-S complexes, we collected micrographs on a Talos Arctica transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher) operating at 200 kV using 
            <rs type="software">SerialEM</rs> automated data collection software (Mastronarde, 2005). Movies were recorded using a 3x3 beam image shift pattern with a K3 camera (Gatan). Data collection parameters are reported in Table S3. Cryo-EM movies were patch motion corrected for beam-induced motion including dose-weighting within cryoSPARC v2.15 (Punjani et al., 2017) after binning super resolution movies for all data sets. Non-dose-weighted images were used to estimate CTF parameters using a cryoSPARC implementation of the Patch CTF job, and all datasets were processed similarly. Briefly, after picking an initial set of particles based on templates from 2D classification of blob picked particles on a small sub-set of images, this set was pared down through several rounds of 3D classification. Ab initio cryoSPARC jobs on a small good subset of these particles revealed distinct states and junk particles. A full set of particles was heterogeneously refined against distinct conformational states and a junk class acting as a trap for bad particles. Particles from each class were separately refined using non-uniform refinement using C1 (C032-S) or C3 symmetry (C051-S and C548-S). Particles from distinct states were re-extracted without binning and were separately refined in rounds of 3D classification. Particles were further subdivided into groups based on beam-tilt and refined separately for CTF parameters and aberration correction. For the C032-S and C051-S data sets, a soft mask (3-pixel extension, 6-pixel soft edge) was generated for the spike S1 subunit and Fab variable domains to improve local resolutions at the Fab-RBD interface. Overall reported resolutions are based on gold standard FSC calculations (Scheres and Chen, 2012).

        <p>Homology models of two of the RBD complexes were made for the Fabs of C549 (class 2) and C080 (class 3). Both complexes were modelled based on the cryo-EM structures of the related 1.3 month Fab-S complexes; i.e., the C548-S and C032-S complexes. The Fab of C548 to C549 involved 27 amino acid changes, whereas there were 16 changes for C032 to C080. Side chains of residues that were disordered in the density of the experimental structures were also modelled to their correct sequence. Homology models were generated by
