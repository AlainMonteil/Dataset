        <p>BACKGROUND The associations between dietary saturated fats and the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) remain controversial, but few studies have compared saturated with unsaturated fats and sources of carbohydrates in relation to CHD risk. OBJECTIVES This study sought to investigate associations of saturated fats compared with unsaturated fats and different sources of carbohydrates in relation to CHD risk.BACKGROUND The associations between dietary saturated fats and the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) remain controversial, but few studies have compared saturated with unsaturated fats and sources of carbohydrates in relation to CHD risk. OBJECTIVES This study sought to investigate associations of saturated fats compared with unsaturated fats and different sources of carbohydrates in relation to CHD risk.</p>
        <p>A recent systematic review and meta-analysis reported no significant association between the consumption of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) (1), but the study failed to specify the replacement macronutrient for saturated fat. Another metaanalysis observed that substituting SFAs with overall carbohydrates was not associated with the risk of CHD (2). Consistent with this analysis, a low-carbohydrate diet score (a higher score being indicative of higher protein and fat intake and lower intake of carbohydrates) was not associated with an increased CHD risk in women (3). None of these studies, however, discriminated between different sources of dietary carbohydrates.A recent systematic review and meta-analysis reported no significant association between the consumption of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) (1), but the study failed to specify the replacement macronutrient for saturated fat.

        <p>Carbohydrates, traditionally classified as simple versus complex, depending on the number of chained sugar moieties, are also frequently classified according to their effect on blood sugar levels, as quantified by the glycemic index (GI). Carbohydrate classification by the GI has been shown to be more strongly associated with cardiometabolic disease than total carbohydrates. For example, whereas no association was observed between overall carbohydrate intake and the risk of CHD (4,5), diets with a low GI were associated with a lower risk of CHD (4,5) and type 2 diabetes (6) compared with high-GI diets. Therefore, it is not surprising that null associations between SFAs and coronary risk were observed in studies that did not distinguish between the quality of carbohydrates that were being substituted for SFAs.Carbohydrates, traditionally classified as simple versus complex, depending on the number of chained sugar moieties, are also frequently classified according to their effect on blood sugar levels, as quantified by the glycemic index (GI).

        <p>One study (7) observed that substituting SFAs with carbohydrates was associated with a nonsignificantly lower risk of myocardial infarction (MI) among participants who consumed a low-GI diet, but with a significantly increased risk among participants who consumed a high-GI diet. However, this association was not replicated in another study (8). To address uncertainties about the associations between dietary fats, carbohydrate quality, and CHD, we aimed to investigate the predicted effects of isocaloric substitutions of carbohydrates for fats, with an a priori hypothesis that the effects of different types of fats on the risk of CHD depend on the carbohydrate quality of the replacement. Two well-established cohorts of U.S. women and men: the NHS (Nurses' Health Study) (9) and the HPFS (Health Professionals Follow-up Study) (10) were the basis for this study. This analysis may have important public health implications for guiding people toward healthy dietary choices as they work to reduce their SFA intake.One study (7) observed that substituting SFAs with carbohydrates was associated with a nonsignificantly lower risk of myocardial infarction (MI) among participants who consumed a low-GI diet, but with a significantly increased risk among participants who consumed a high-GI diet.

        <p>For the present analysis, we excluded women and men (n ¼ 7,615) with implausible FFQ data (&lt;800 or &gt;4,200 kcal/day for men, &lt;600 or &gt;3,500 kcal/day for women, or &gt;70 food items missing). We also ASCERTAINMENT OF CHD. We included nonfatal MI and CHD death as our primary endpoint of total CHD, which was identified primarily through a review of medical records, as previously described (11). Participants (or next of kin for deceased participants) reporting a primary endpoint were asked for permission to have their medical records reviewed by physicians who were blinded to the participant's risk factor status. MI was confirmed if the World Health Organization criteria were met (12). MIs that required hospital admission and for which confirmatory information was obtained by phone interview or letter, but for which no medical records were available, were classified as probable. We included all confirmed and probable cases because results were similar in both previous (9) and present analyses when probable cases were excluded.For the present analysis, we excluded women and men (n ¼ 7,615) with implausible FFQ data (&lt;800 or &gt;4,200 kcal/day for men, &lt;600 or &gt;3,500 kcal/day for women, or &gt;70 food items missing).

        <p>DIETARY ASSESSMENT. NHS participants completed an FFQ first in 1980, and again in 1984, 1986, 1990, 1994, 1998, 2002, and 2006. In the HPFS, we assessed dietary information using the FFQ, administered every 4 years from 1986 to 2006. Participants were asked how often, on average, they had consumed specific foods during the past year. Serving sizes were specified for each food in the FFQ. The questionnaire had 9 possible responses, ranging from never or &lt;1 time per month to $6 times per day. Participants were asked to specify the types of fat or oil used for frying and baking, at the table, and the type, if any, of margarine usually used.DIETARY ASSESSMENT.

The FFQ provides a reasonably good estimate of total and specific types of fat compared with multiple dietary records; correlation coefficients between intakes from the 1986 questionnaire and 1986 dietary records were 0.57 for total fat, 0.68 for SFAs, 0.48 for polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and 0.58 for monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) (15). Correlations between dietary fatty acid intake assessed by the FFQ and the composition of fatty acids in adipose tissue were 0.51 for trans fat, 0.37 for PUFAs, and 0.48 for long-chain n-3 fatty acids (16).Department of Agriculture food composition data (14), taking into account types of margarine and fats used in cooking and baking.

        <p>In our analysis of carbohydrates, we focused on the major food sources of carbohydrates, including potatoes, added sugars from beverages and foods, and grains. These were then classified into 2 carbohydrate source categories: 1) carbohydrates from whole grains; and 2) carbohydrates from refined starches/added sugars, mainly including foods with relatively high GI values, such as potatoes, refined grains, and added sugar from beverages and foods (17). The food list is detailed in Online Table 1. We did not include carbohydrates from fruits, vegetables, or legumes in our carbohydrate categories because these foods have benefits separate from their carbohydrate quality in terms of glycemic effects, and have previously been shown to be inversely associated with CHD in our cohorts (18).In our analysis of carbohydrates, we focused on the major food sources of carbohydrates, including potatoes, added sugars from beverages and foods, and grains.

        <p>Because dietary intake may affect CHD over an extended period of time, to best represent long-term intake, we calculated cumulative average intakes of nutrients using repeated FFQ data for our primary analysis (19). We applied time-varying Cox analysis in which the average of dietary intake at or before the beginning of a 4-year interval was used as a predictor for incident CHD in that 4-year interval. For each follow-up period, baseline CHD cases were excluded. Participants were divided into quintile categories of intake according to their nutrient intakes. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing participants in a given quintile category of nutrient intake with those in the lowest quintile. To quantify a linear trend, we conducted a Wald test for linear trend by assigning the median intake within each quintile and modeling this variable continuously.Because dietary intake may affect CHD over an extended period of time, to best represent long-term intake, we calculated cumulative average intakes of nutrients using repeated FFQ data for our primary analysis (19).

        <p>In the multivariable-adjusted model, we adjusted for known risk factors for CHD, including body mass index (&lt;20.9, 21 to 24.9, 25 to 29.9, 30 to 31.9, and $32 kg/m 2 ); family history of diabetes (yes or no) and MI (yes or no); menopausal status (pre-or post-menopausal) and hormone therapy use (never, past, or current) in women; regular use of aspirin (yes or no) and multiple vitamins (yes or no); smoking status (never, former, current: 1 to 14, 15 to 24, or $25 cigarettes/day); physical activity (quintiles); presence of hypertension (yes or no) and hypercholesterolemia (yes or no) at baseline; and alcohol intake (0, 0.1 to 4.9, 5.0 to 9.9, 10.0 to 14.9, 15.0 to 29.9 or $30 g/day for men; for women, the highest 2 categories were merged into $15 g/day); energy intake (kcal/day); and percentages of energy from protein and dietary cholesterol (all in quintiles).In the multivariable-adjusted model, we adjusted for known risk factors for CHD, including body mass index (&lt;20.9, 21 to 24.9, 25 to 29.9, 30 to 31.9, and $32 kg/m 2 ); family history of diabetes (yes or no) and MI (yes or no); menopausal status (pre-or post-menopausal) and hormone therapy use (never, past, or current) in women; regular use of aspirin (yes or no) and multiple vitamins (yes or no); smoking status (never, former, current: 1 to 14, 15 to 24, or $25 cigarettes/day); physical activity (quintiles); presence of hypertension (yes or no) and hypercholesterolemia (yes or no) at baseline; and alcohol intake (0, 0.1 to 4.9, 5.0 to 9.9, 10.0 to 14.9, 15.0 to 29.9 or $30 g/day for men; for women, the highest 2 categories were merged into $15 g/day); energy intake (kcal/day); and percentages of energy from protein and dietary cholesterol (all in quintiles).</p>

        <p>Incidence of diabetes, angina, hypertension, coronary artery surgery or angioplasty, and hypercholesterolemia during follow-up periods were not included in multivariable models because these may be considered intermediate outcomes on the causal pathway between diet and CHD. However, intermediate diagnoses were included in sensitivity analyses. In additional sensitivity analyses, we stopped updating diet at the beginning of the interval in which the potential intermediate outcome(s) developed in the participant. Because of differences between the 2 cohorts in sex, follow-up time, and the questionnaires, all analyses were performed separately in each cohort to achieve better control of confounding. To obtain overall estimates for both sexes and to increase statistical power, the HRs from the age-and multivariable-adjusted models from the 2 cohorts were combined with the use of a fixed-effects inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis because no significant heterogeneity between the cohorts was observed.

Participants with higher energy intake from SFAs also tended to have higher energy intake from MUFAs and trans fats and lower energy intake from carbohydrates (Table 1). Carbohydrates from whole grains contributed 0.7% to 5.2% of energy, whereas carbohydrates from refined starches/ added sugars contributed 17.7% to 23.9% of energy.

        <p>In 2 large, independent prospective cohorts of U.S. men and women, we found that replacing intake A large body of evidence indicates that higher intake of most dietary SFAs increases blood levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and the lowdensity lipoprotein to high-density lipoprotein ratio (21), both of which are associated with a higher risk of CHD (22). A reduction in SFA intake has therefore been at the heart of most dietary recommendations, with the objective of reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Recently, this hypothesis was challenged by studies that failed to find an association between SFAs and CHD (1,2). However, in these studies, the replacement nutrient was not specified, although by default, most of the other calories in almost all diets would have been carbohydrates, primarily from refined grains and added sugars. Notably, in our own cohorts, we also observed the less healthful replacement to be the norm.In 2 large, independent prospective cohorts of U.S. men and women, we found that replacing intake A large body of evidence indicates that higher intake of most dietary SFAs increases blood levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and the lowdensity lipoprotein to high-density lipoprotein ratio (21), both of which are associated with a higher risk of CHD (22).

        <p>In clinical trials, replacement of SFAs with refined carbohydrates has been associated with lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and higher triglycerides (21). The fact that predominantly lowquality carbohydrates, such as refined grains and added sugars, have served as the primary isocaloric replacements of saturated fats in previous analyses, likely explains the previous null associations between SFAs and CHD. The importance of the source of carbohydrates was also suggested by a previous analysis from Denmark that was stratified according to the overall dietary GI (7). In that study, replacing SFAs with carbohydrates was associated with a higher risk of MI when the dietary GI was high; however, when the dietary GI was low, replacing These consumption patterns suggest that there is substantial room for improvement in the American diet when it comes to intake of PUFAs and whole grains as meaningful replacements for SFAs.In clinical trials, replacement of SFAs with refined carbohydrates has been associated with lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and higher triglycerides (21).

        <p>Because MUFAs tend to share the same food sources as SFAs (e.g., meats and dairy), the estimated association between MUFAs and CHD risk in most epidemiological studies in the United States is likely to be confounded by these food sources. In our study, replacing SFAs with MUFAs was associated with a lower CHD risk, suggesting that there are healthful benefits to replacing food sources of saturated fats with plant sources of MUFAs, such as vegetables oils (e.g., olive oil and canola oil), nuts, and seeds. The apparent benefit that we observed for MUFAs is consistent with their effects on low-and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which are similar to those for PUFAs (21,23). In the PREDIMED (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea) trial, the intervention groups consuming a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or mixed nuts experienced a 30% lower risk of cardiovascular disease compared with the control group (25).Because MUFAs tend to share the same food sources as SFAs (e.g., meats and dairy), the estimated association between MUFAs and CHD risk in most epidemiological studies in the United States is likely to be confounded by these food sources.

In the PREDIMED (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea) trial, the intervention groups consuming a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or mixed nuts experienced a 30% lower risk of cardiovascular disease compared with the control group (25).</p>

        <p>However, our results were generally consistent with those from randomized clinical trials on diet and blood lipids and cardiovascular risk. In addition, measurement errors are inevitable in estimates of food and nutrient intakes. However, our adjustment for energy intake and use of prospectively collected, cumulatively averaged intake reduced the magnitude of measurement errors (26). In addition, we could not make finer distinctions between subtypes of CHD (e.g., ST-segment elevation MI), which would require electrocardiographic data that were not collected in the cohorts. Such subtypes may be relevant to the present hypothesis, and future research in this area is warranted.

        <p>Isocaloric dietary substitutions of SFAs by trans fats or carbohydrates from refined starches/added sugars were not associated with a risk of CHD (p &gt; 0.1 for both). Replacing 5% of energy from SFAs with 5% of energy from PUFAs was associated with a 25% lower risk of CHD (HR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.84; p &lt; 0.0001).
