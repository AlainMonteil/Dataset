        <p>Growing evidence indicates the community of microorganisms throughout the gastrointestinal tract, (i.e., gut microbiota), is associated with anxiety and depressive disorders. We present the first systematic review of the gut microbiota in anxiety disorders, along with an update in depression. Consideration of shared underlying features is essential due to the high rates of comorbidity. Systematic searches, following PRISMA guidelines, identified 26 studies (two case-control comparisons of the gut microbiota in generalized anxiety disorder, 17 in depression, one incorporating both anxiety/depression, and five including symptom-only measures). Alpha and beta diversity findings were inconsistent; however, differences in bacterial taxa indicated disorders may be characterized by higher abundance of proinflammatory species (e.g., Enterobacteriaceae and Desulfovibrio), and lower short-chain fatty acid producing-bacteria (e.g., Faecalibacterium). Several taxa, and their mechanisms of action, may relate to anxiety and depression pathophysiology via communication of peripheral inflammation to the brain. Although the gut microbiota remains a promising target for prevention and therapy, future research should assess confounders, particularly diet and psychotropics, and should examine microorganism function.Growing evidence indicates the community of microorganisms throughout the gastrointestinal tract, (i.e., gut microbiota), is associated with anxiety and depressive disorders.

        <p>The gut microbiota in anxiety and depression -a systematic review Anxiety and depressive disorders are ubiquitous and debilitating psychiatric conditions that collectively affect close to 10% of the global population every year (World Health Organization, 2017). The World Health Organization (2019) estimates the global loss in productivity due to anxiety and depressive disorders amounts to $1 trillion USD per yeara trajectory expected to rise (Doran &amp; Kinchin, 2019). Although engagement with psychotherapeutic and psychotropic treatments has increased over the past several decades (Olfson, Druss, &amp; Marcus, 2015;Stephenson, Karanges, &amp; McGregor, 2012), the prevalence and burden of anxiety and depressive disorders remains unchanged (Jorm, Patten, Brugha, &amp; Mojtabai, 2017). Furthermore, there is substantial variation in response to existing treatments, which are overall efficacious in less than half of diagnosed patients (Casacalenda, Perry, &amp; Looper, 2002;Cipriani et al., 2018). Accordingly, in order to develop more effective treatment targets, there is an urgent need to gain new insight into the underlying pathophysiology of anxiety and depressive disorders. The high comorbidity between internalizing disorders has been cited as evidence for possible shared physiological processes, risk factors, and illness trajectories (Kotov et al., 2017). One such promising area of research is the microbiota-gut-brain axis, which may elucidate shared pathophysiology.The gut microbiota in anxiety and depression -a systematic review Anxiety and depressive disorders are ubiquitous and debilitating psychiatric conditions that collectively affect close to 10% of the global population every year (World Health Organization, 2017).

        <p>A growing body of research describes the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiota -the ecosystem of trillions of bacteria, viruses, archaea and fungi, along with their collective gene pool -with the host's central nervous system (CNS; Dinan &amp; Cryan, 2015, 2017;Rieder, Wisniewski, Alderman, &amp; Campbell, 2017). This biochemical signaling pathway, also known as the gut-brain-axis, is thought to influence cognitive functioning and mood via neural, metabolic, hormonal, and immune-mediated mechanisms (Foster &amp; McVey Neufeld, 2013). The gut microbiota is a key regulator within the gut-brain-axis: bacterial species regulate the production of neurotransmitters and their precursors (e.g., serotonin, GABA, tryptophan), and can secrete and upregulate essential proteins and metabolites involved in neuropeptide and gut hormone release, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs; e.g., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Clostridium leptum) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; e.g., Bifidobacterium; Bercik et al., 2010;O'Sullivan et al., 2011;Parada Venegas et al., 2019). Furthermore, vagal and spinal afferent pathways mediate neural communication between gut microbes and the CNS, and the gut microbiota modulates immune signaling from gut to brain, via cytokine induction (Dinan &amp; Cryan, 2017;Foster, Rinaman, &amp; Cryan, 2017).A growing body of research describes the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiota -the ecosystem of trillions of bacteria, viruses, archaea and fungi, along with their collective gene pool -with the host's central nervous system (CNS; Dinan &amp; Cryan, 2015, 2017;Rieder, Wisniewski, Alderman, &amp; Campbell, 2017).

        <p>The extant literature indicates that gut microbes may also be involved in the development and function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which coordinates the adaptive stress response in the body (Foster et al., 2017;Sudo et al., 2004).The extant literature indicates that gut microbes may also be involved in the development and function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which coordinates the adaptive stress response in the body (Foster et al., 2017;Sudo et al., 2004).</p>
        <p>Dysregulated HPA axis signaling is implicated in anxiety and depressive disorders, typically associated with higher levels of cortisol and inflammatory mediators that lead to a sustained proinflammatory state (Keller et al., 2017;Winter, Hart, Charlesworth, &amp; Sharpley, 2018).Dysregulated HPA axis signaling is implicated in anxiety and depressive disorders, typically associated with higher levels of cortisol and inflammatory mediators that lead to a sustained proinflammatory state (Keller et al., 2017;Winter, Hart, Charlesworth, &amp; Sharpley, 2018).</p>
        <p>Not only can the gut microbiota contribute to increases in cortisol and inflammation (Kamada, Seo, Chen, &amp; Núñez, 2013), proinflammatory states may compound microbiota alterations via deleterious effects on gastrointestinal health. Excessive levels of circulating cortisol and inflammatory mediators increase intestinal permeability, thus allowing Gramnegative bacteria to translocate into the bloodstream which may induce chronic CNS inflammation (i.e., bacteria which contain an additional lipopolysaccharide exterior membrane, associated with inflammation in high concentrations; Foster et al., 2017; T.-T. Huang et al., 2019). This suggests that microbiota-driven inflammatory responses may contribute to affective disorders, due in part to increased intestinal permeability. Similarly, gastrointestinal conditions suspected to involve alterations in the gut microbiota and intestinal permeability co-occur at remarkably high rates with psychiatric disorders (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome; Simpson, Mu, Haslam, Schwartz, &amp; Simmons, 2020). Hence, the role of the gut microbiota in mood regulation and emotional processing, via the gut-brain-axis, may be of particular relevance to anxiety and depression etiology.Not only can the gut microbiota contribute to increases in cortisol and inflammation (Kamada, Seo, Chen, &amp; Núñez, 2013), proinflammatory states may compound microbiota alterations via deleterious effects on gastrointestinal health.

        <p>Given the role of gastrointestinal bacteria in the bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain, recent studies have focused on characterizing gut microbiota composition in anxiety and depression. Preclinical models highlight gut microbiota disturbances in rodents exhibiting anxiety-and depressive-like behaviors, and report normalization of both behavioral and microbial alterations after bacterial probiotic administration (Mayer, Knight, Mazmanian, Cryan, &amp; Tillisch, 2014;Mayer, Tillisch, &amp; Gupta, 2015). Extension of this research into humans has been relatively slow prior to the last several years. Reviews have highlighted gut microbiota alterations in clinical depressive disorders relative to healthy control groups (Cheung et al., 2019;T.-T. Huang et al., 2019;Sanada et al., 2020); however, findings related to the diversity of microbial communities in depression are inconsistent, and it is unclear whether specific bacterial taxa drive group differences (Cheung et al., 2019;T.-T. Huang et al., 2019;Sanada et al., 2020). Existing reviews have also inadequately considered research quality and the effects of confounders, particularly diet and psychotropic medication (Simpson, Schwartz, &amp; Simmons, 2020).Given the role of gastrointestinal bacteria in the bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain, recent studies have focused on characterizing gut microbiota composition in anxiety and depression.

        <p>The present systematic review provides an essential update of the expanding literature characterizing the gut microbiota in depressive disorders, and provides the first systematic review in anxiety disorders. This paper also aims to integrate evidence to examine whether these highly comorbid conditions share underlying microbial features, and to critically appraise the effect of methodological inconsistencies and confounding factors. A more nuanced understanding of the pathophysiology of anxiety and depressive disorders may inform future diagnosis and treatment options in these common and debilitating psychiatric conditions.The present systematic review provides an essential update of the expanding literature characterizing the gut microbiota in depressive disorders, and provides the first systematic review in anxiety disorders.

        <p>Characterization of the gut microbiota involved a multi-faceted approach in most studies, usually including a measure of both alpha and beta diversity. Alpha diversity provides a summary statistic of the microbial community, whereby higher alpha diversity indicates a greater number of species (i.e., "richness"), with more even representation (i.e., "evenness"), and/or greater biodiversity according to the ancestral dissimilarity of species (i.e., "phylogenetic diversity"; Figure 2). The computation of alpha diversity indices (e.g., Shannon, Simpson's, and Faith's phylogenetic diversity) vary in their consideration and weighting of these factors, but overall, alpha diversity is often used as a proxy for community stability and function (Shade, 2017). The alpha diversity indices utilized in the reviewed literature are described in Appendix D.Characterization of the gut microbiota involved a multi-faceted approach in most studies, usually including a measure of both alpha and beta diversity.

        <p>While alpha diversity is estimated for each participant separately, beta diversity is an inter-individual measure that examines similarity of communities relative to the other samples analyzed (Figure 3). Dimension reduction techniques are employed to visualize data on a smaller number of axes (e.g., using principal coordinates analysis [PCoA]), whereby samples closer together are more similar in their microbial composition. This can be used to examine whether participants in the same group (e.g., with a depressive disorder) cluster together in multidimensional space by their microbiota, but separately from another group (e.g., controls). Just as for alpha diversity, different measures of beta diversity (e.g., utilizing weighted vs. unweighted UniFrac distances) emphasize different factors (e.g., evenness, phylogeny). Machine learning/clustering methods can also be utilized to analyze whether groups can be differentiated based on their microbial communities (e.g., hierarchical clustering, random forest models). The varying approaches used to calculate beta diversity in the reviewed literature are summarized in Appendix D.While alpha diversity is estimated for each participant separately, beta diversity is an inter-individual measure that examines similarity of communities relative to the other samples analyzed (Figure 3).

        <p>Anxiety/depression symptoms. Three studies which investigated cross-sectional associations between depression symptoms did not report alpha diversity indices considering richness and evenness. In the four studies that did, no significant associations were observed between richness/evenness indices with depression symptoms (Jackson et al., 2018;Kleiman et al., 2017;Mason et al., 2020;Naudé et al., 2020). No studies investigated community richness and depression symptoms. One study investigated phylogenetic diversity, but found no association with depression symptoms (Jackson et al., 2018). Four of the five studies which incorporated anxiety symptom measures investigated associations with alpha diversity indices incorporating richness and evenness. All four studies reported no association between the Shannon index and anxiety symptoms (Jackson et al., 2018;Kleiman et al., 2017;Mason et al., 2020;Naudé et al., 2020).

        <p>Case-control studies in depressive disorders. Of the 19 case-control studies which examined the gut microbiota of participants with a depressive disorder, 13 analyzed beta diversity. Eight studies found significant differences in beta diversity between participants with a depressive disorder and controls, as indicated by group clustering on PCoA (J.

Highlighting variation based on the distance measure employed, Huang et al. (2018) found significant group differences using weighted UniFrac, but not using unweighted UniFrac (Y. Huang et al., 2018). Five studies found no difference in beta diversity in participants with a depressive disorder relative to controls (Chahwan et al., 2019;Jiang et al., 2015;Mason et al., 2020;Rong et al., 2019;Vinberg et al., 2019). One of these studies found no difference between participants with depression, anxiety, comorbid anxiety and depression, and controls on PCoA when stratified by diagnosis (weighted UniFrac), but hierarchical clustering of beta diversity identified two participant groups associated with anhedonia scores derived from self-report questionnaires (weighted UniFrac; Mason et al., 2020).

Zheng et al., 2016). A higher abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae incertae sedis was reported in depression in four studies (J. Chen et al., 2018 [males only]; Chung et al., 2019;Jiang et al., 2015;P. Zheng et al., 2016), as well as higher Holdemania in three studies of depression (Chung et al., 2019;Kelly et al., 2016;Valles-Colomer et al., 2019 [medicated cohort only]). The genus Streptococcus was also reported to be higher in MDD in four studies (Chung et al., 2019;Lin et al., 2017;Rong et al., 2019;P. Zheng et al., 2016), although a negative correlation between depression symptoms was also reported in females only (J. Chen et al., 2018). Three studies observed higher Desulfovibrio in MDD relative to controls (J. Chen et al., 2018 [females only]; Cheng et al., 2019;Szczesniak et al., 2016). Finally, higher levels of Paraprevotella were observed in two studies in depression (Kelly et al., 2016;Liu et al., 2016), and its abundance was positively correlated with depression symptoms (Taylor et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>Fewer studies of depressive disorders examined the microbiota with sufficient taxonomic resolution to report differences at the species level. Nevertheless, two case-control studies independently reported a number of overlapping findings, including a higher relative abundance of Acidaminococcus intestini, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium dentium, Bifidobacterium longum, Clostridium saccharolyticum, Megasphaera elsdenii, and Oscillibacter valericigenes in MDD relative to controls (Lai et al., 2019;Rong et al., 2019).Fewer studies of depressive disorders examined the microbiota with sufficient taxonomic resolution to report differences at the species level.

        <p>Case-control studies in anxiety disorders. Two studies found several consistent taxonomic differences between participants with GAD relative to controls, including higher Enterobacterales, Bacteroidaceae, Escherichia/Shigella, Bacteroides, Tyzerella, and lower Firmicutes, Mollicutes, Prevotellaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Subdoligranulum, Coprococcus and Dialister in patients (Y. Chen et al., 2019;Jiang et al., 2018). A third study observed a lower abundance of Bacteroides in the anxiety/depression comorbidity relative to a depression only group (Mason et al., 2020). Differential taxa observed in studies comparing the gut microbiota in case-control studies in anxiety were subsequently considered alongside findings reported in depression. A total of six studies observed lower Prevotellaceae relative to controls, including four studies in MDD (Z. Chen et al., 2018;Chung et al., 2019;Jiang et al., 2015;Kelly et al., 2016), as was observed in the two case-control studies in GAD reported above (Y. Chen et al., 2019;Jiang et al., 2018). Two studies observed higher Escherichia/Shigella in GAD (Y. Chen et al., 2019;Jiang et al., 2018), and a positive correlation between anxiety symptoms and its abundance in one study (Y. Chen et al., 2019). In contrast, two studies observed a lower abundance of this genus in MDD/depression (Jiang et al., 2015;Liu et al., 2016), although one study did observe a positive correlation with depression symptoms (Y.

        <p>The genera Faecalibacterium and Sutterella were also lower in GAD (Jiang et al., 2018), as was separately observed in five and four studies in depressive disorders, respectively.

        <p>Qualitative synthesis of this literature revealed that alpha and beta diversity were widely investigated by the included studies; however, differences in these community-wide measures were inconsistent. For alpha diversity, the direction of any significant effect was, with one exception, in the direction of reduced alpha diversity in the clinical group, but such differences were only observed in less than half of all analyses. Similarly, less than half of beta diversity comparisons reported a significant difference between clinical and control groups. Instead, differences in the gut microbiota between cases and controls appeared to be localized to specific microbial taxa. In the following sections, we will discuss each of these findings in more detail, then attempt to synthesize the functional relevance of the reported taxonomic differences. We will reflect on the limitations of the extant literature in order to subsequently describe important considerations for future research.Qualitative synthesis of this literature revealed that alpha and beta diversity were widely investigated by the included studies; however, differences in these community-wide measures were inconsistent.

        <p>The use of alpha diversity indices in biomedical research stems from the assumption that "higher diversity is somehow more meritorious ecologically", and that diversity of species provides a proxy for microbial function and stability that is assumed to be favorable for the host (Shade, 2017). Consistently, lower diversity in patients relative to controls has been reported in a number of diseases and mental health disorders (Ai et al., 2019;Gong, Gong, Wang, Yu, &amp; Dong, 2016;B. Ma et al., 2019;Nguyen, Hathaway, Kosciolek, Knight, &amp; Jeste, 2019;Prehn-Kristensen et al., 2018). Nevertheless, the present review reveals that this conclusion is, at present, unfounded in anxiety and depression: more case-control studies found no difference in alpha diversity between anxiety/depression groups and controls (n=10), compared to those who found lower alpha diversity in anxiety/depression across all measured indices (n=2). Our conclusions are supported by a recent meta-analysis of including a very small number of case-control studies in MDD, which also found no significant difference in alpha diversity (Sanada et al., 2020). Furthermore, the present review revealed that estimated shared phylogenetic structure of the gut microbiota between groups, as assessed by beta diversity, had little consensus; ten studies reported beta diversity differences in anxiety or depressive disorders relative to controls, although six studies found no such difference.The use of alpha diversity indices in biomedical research stems from the assumption that "higher diversity is somehow more meritorious ecologically", and that diversity of species provides a proxy for microbial function and stability that is assumed to be favorable for the host (Shade, 2017).

        <p>The usefulness of gastrointestinal microbial diversity as a proxy for host health has been widely critiqued, with research recognizing that host-microbe interactions are more complex than can be modelled by simply quantifying the number of bacterial species present in a community (Gerritsen, Smidt, Rijkers, &amp; De Vos, 2011;Shade, 2017). Indeed, several recent systematic syntheses have reported no clear consensus with regards to alpha diversity in mental health and neurological/developmental conditions relative to controls, including in Parkinson's disease (Nuzum et al., 2020), autism spectrum disorder (Ho et al., 2020), bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia (Nguyen et al., 2019). A number of intrinsic and extrinsic/environmental factors also contribute to variation in baseline microbial diversity, thus complexing its measurement, including medication, body mass index, age, sex, diet, and early-life exposures (e.g., delivery method, breastfeeding;De Filippo et al., 2010;Hollister et al., 2015;Leeming, Johnson, Spector, &amp; Roy, 2019;Z. Ma &amp; Li, 2019;Reese &amp; Dunn, 2018; Commented [1]: I assume bipolar disorder was discussed with schizophrenia in the same paper (which is why I changed the order so the and could be between them, but a very minor point so feel free to change it back) If not, then add ref for bipolar disorder?

        <p>Studies investigating the gut microbiota in anxiety and depression should take into consideration these factors to better disentangle disorder-specific effects from baseline individual differences in diversity. Moreover, existing multivariate analyses which compare beta diversity between groups often involve dichotomization based on absence or presence of a condition (PCoA/NMDS). Research in anxiety and depressive disorders thus encounters several methodological challenges not faced by conditions with defined biomarkers, including the disparate methods by which clinical groups are defined (e.g., self-reported symptom levels, psychiatrist diagnosis, clinical interviews). Accordingly, incorporation of bias due to nosology requires consideration in future research.Studies investigating the gut microbiota in anxiety and depression should take into consideration these factors to better disentangle disorder-specific effects from baseline individual differences in diversity.

        <p>Although diversity findings were inconsistent, specific bacterial taxa were implicated in studies which compared gut microbiota of clinical groups relative to controls. Among the most consistent findings was lower abundance of Bacteroidetes, Prevotellaceae, Faecalibacterium, Coprococcus, and Sutterella, as well as a higher abundance of Actinobacteria and Eggerthella in participants with MDD/depressive disorders relative to controls. Participants with GAD also had a lower abundance of Firmicutes, Ruminococcaceae, Subdoligranulum, and Dialister, and a higher abundance of Enterobacterales, Enterobacteriaceae, and Escherichia/Shigella, albeit in a small number of studies. Several taxa were implicated across both anxiety and depression, including lower Prevotellaceae, Faecalibacterium, Sutterella, and Dialister, as well as higher Lactobacillus.Although diversity findings were inconsistent, specific bacterial taxa were implicated in studies which compared gut microbiota of clinical groups relative to controls.

        <p>It is worth noting that there was a large number of studies which found no significant difference in these taxa, although this may be more reflective of low power and methodological issues, rather than true inconsistency between groups (further discussed below). Several mechanisms by which these taxa may be associated with depression and anxiety will be discussed herein, focusing on increased proinflammatory communication via the gut-brain-axis, as well as differences in how studies considered methodological confounders which may modulate microbial composition.It is worth noting that there was a large number of studies which found no significant difference in these taxa, although this may be more reflective of low power and methodological issues, rather than true inconsistency between groups (further discussed below).

        <p>A number of taxa reported to have a higher relative abundance in clinical anxiety and depression are associated with gastrointestinal inflammation (i.e., Enterobacterales, Enterobacteriaceae, Eggerthella, Desulfovibrio; Belizário, Faintuch, &amp; Garay-Malpartida, 2018;Devkota et al., 2012;Loubinoux, Bronowicki, Pereira, Mougenel, &amp; Le Faou, 2002; depressive disorders, which is of particular interest given that specific strains are commonly considered anti-inflammatory and used as probiotics (Saez-Lara, Gomez-Llorente, Plaza-Diaz, &amp; Gil, 2015).

        <p>These hypotheses stem from the observation of higher levels of acute phase proteins and proinflammatory cytokines in otherwise medically healthy individuals with an anxiety or depressive disorder (DellaGioia &amp; Hannestad, 2010;Haapakoski, Mathieu, Ebmeier, Alenius, &amp; Kivimäki, 2015;Pitsavos et al., 2006). Consistently, changes in the gut microbiota, and the resultant cascade of proinflammatory communication (Figure 6), is a possible contributor to the immune dysregulation observed in mental health disorders. Peripheral inflammation may be associated with brain function via signaling across the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and permeation of immune cells into the brain (DellaGioia &amp; Hannestad, 2010). Inflammatory signals also activate vagal afferents which relay information to the brain from the enteric nervous system, inducing a local CNS increase of noradrenaline and acetylcholine to keep inflammation at bay (Andersson, 2005). Moreover, infiltration of lipopolysaccharides and bacterial metabolites may activate innate resistance receptors, resulting in CNS inflammation (Sochocka et al., 2019). Longer-term induction of this system is hypothesized to impair downregulation of HPA axis hormones, contributing to sustained high levels of circulating cortisol in anxiety and depression (Madeeh Hashmi, Awais Aftab, Mazhar, Umair, &amp; Butt, 2013).These hypotheses stem from the observation of higher levels of acute phase proteins and proinflammatory cytokines in otherwise medically healthy individuals with an anxiety or depressive disorder (DellaGioia &amp; Hannestad, 2010;Haapakoski, Mathieu, Ebmeier, Alenius, &amp; Kivimäki, 2015;Pitsavos et al., 2006).

        <p>The potential for microbiota-mediated inflammation in anxiety and depression is not only indicated by the increase in inflammation-associated microbial members, but may be further exacerbated by a loss of species that secrete anti-inflammatory metabolic products.The potential for microbiota-mediated inflammation in anxiety and depression is not only indicated by the increase in inflammation-associated microbial members, but may be further exacerbated by a loss of species that secrete anti-inflammatory metabolic products.</p>
        <p>The present review revealed a reduction of bacterial species which secrete the antiinflammatory SCFAs in anxiety/depression groups relative to controls, including Faecalibacterium, Coprococcus, Clostridium XIVa species which can produce butyrate (Sokol et al., 2008;Vital, Karch, &amp; Pieper, 2017), and Megamonas which can produce acetate and propionate (Sakon, Nagai, Morotomi, &amp; Tanaka, 2008). A reduction in SCFAproducing species, and their resultant products, may contribute to dysregulated immune function. Consistently, butyrate has been implicated in reinstating BBB integrity in germ-free mice by increasing expression of tight junction proteins, and also by attenuating neuronal deficits (Stilling et al., 2016). Lower levels of butyrate have also been associated with increased intestinal permeability (Plöger et al., 2012;Stilling et al., 2016), as well as higher levels of several taxa which were observed with greater abundance in participants with anxiety and depression (e.g., Enterobacterales, Desulfovibrio, Eggerthella; Maldonado-Contreras et al., 2017;Pedersen et al., 2018;Wexler, 2007). Accordingly, a lower concentration of butyrate, and the implications this has for mucosal barrier integrity, increases the likelihood of translocation of microorganisms and their products into the bloodstream. Containment of luminal contents is essential to maintain balance between the host immune system, as permeability facilitates increased translocation of bacteria, their endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides), and other metabolites into the bloodstream, which significantly impact organs throughout the body (Bischoff et al., 2014). Similar mechanisms may underlie the association between the gut microbiota with anxiety and depression, as microbial metabolites have been associated with BBB permeability and neuroinflammation (Pedersen et al., 2018), and the administration of lipopolysaccharides induces symptoms that resemble idiopathic depression (DellaGioia &amp; Hannestad, 2010).

        <p>Translational studies have begun to target microbiota-immune-brain dysregulation in internalizing disorders, with results supporting the possibility of microbially-mediated inflammation. Inflammation and colonic barrier integrity have been demonstrated to improve following supplementation with probiotic bacterial strains, albeit in functional gastrointestinal disorder cohorts (Schmulson &amp; Chang, 2011). Benefits of butyrate-producing species on anxiety and depression-like symptoms have also been observed in preclinical models (Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, B. longrum and B. breve;Hao, Wang, Guo, &amp; Liu, 2019;Tian, Wang, Zhao, Zhang, &amp; Chen, 2019). High soluble fiber diets promoting butyrateproducing genera have also been associated with decreased proinflammatory cytokines and anxiety symptoms (Bourassa, Alim, Bultman, &amp; Ratan, 2016). An improved understanding of gut microbiota function in anxiety and depressive disorders may inform the direction for targeted and personalized interventions.Translational studies have begun to target microbiota-immune-brain dysregulation in internalizing disorders, with results supporting the possibility of microbially-mediated inflammation.

        <p>A range of exogenous factors were not adequately considered by studies, including psychotropic medication. Previous reviews have highlighted higher Lachnospiraceae in depression (Cheung et al., 2019;T.-T. Huang et al., 2019), although the present review observed this finding primarily in studies which failed to exclude for psychiatric medication (J. Chen et al., 2018;Z. Chen et al., 2018;Cheng et al., 2019;Chung et al., 2019;Jackson et al., 2018). To our knowledge, no studies have examined the effects of anti-depressants on Lachnospiraceae in humans; however, a recent study reported Lachnospiraceae species were more abundant in SSRI-treated mice compared to controls (Lyte, Daniels, &amp; Schmitz-Esser, 2019). One reviewed study also highlighted that higher Lactobacillus, a member of the Lachnospiraceae family, was not significant after controlling for medication (Valles-Colomer et al., 2019).

Huang et al., 2019), although the present review observed this finding primarily in studies which failed to exclude for psychiatric medication (J. Chen et al., 2018;Z. Chen et al., 2018;Cheng et al., 2019;Chung et al., 2019;Jackson et al., 2018). To our knowledge, no studies have examined the effects of anti-depressants on Lachnospiraceae in humans; however, a recent study reported Lachnospiraceae species were more abundant in SSRI-treated mice compared to controls (Lyte, Daniels, &amp; Schmitz-Esser, 2019). One reviewed study also highlighted that higher Lactobacillus, a member of the Lachnospiraceae family, was not significant after controlling for medication (Valles-Colomer et al., 2019). Psychotropic medication remains a significant source of inter-study variation which requires consideration in future studies, particularly if the aim is to understand the gut microbiota with regards to anxiety and depression pathophysiology.</p>
        <p>The present review revealed a higher abundance of Actinobacteria in MDD relative to controls (J. Chen et al., 2018;Z. Chen et al., 2018;Chung et al., 2019;Rong et al., 2019;P. Zheng et al., 2016), in line with a previous review (T.-T. Huang et al., 2019). Consumption of a high-fat and animal protein diet has also been associated with elevated Actinobacteria (Rinninella et al., 2019), and the majority of studies which reported differences in Actinobacteria did not control for diet (Y. Chen et al., 2019;Z. Chen et al., 2018;Rong et al., 2019;P. Zheng et al., 2016). Further investigations which adequately model dietary intake are required to disentangle whether associations are driven by dietary intake or independently associated with MDD. Similarly, a large number of studies in both depressive disorders and GAD reported lower abundance of the family Prevotellaceae compared to controls (Y. Chen et al., 2019;Z. Chen et al., 2018;Chung et al., 2019;Jiang et al., 2015Jiang et al., , 2018;;Kelly et al., 2016). This bacterial family consists of a variety of genera associated with plant polysaccharide and mucin glycoprotein degradation (Flint, Scott, Duncan, Louis, &amp; Forano, 2012). Complex interactions between low carbohydrate intake and deficiencies in disaccharide metabolism have previously been hypothesized to explain reduced Prevotellaceae in participants with autism (Kang et al., 2013). Accordingly, further research is required to understand how dietary intake may be associated with the lower abundance of Prevotellaceae observed in anxiety and depressive disorders. Understanding the complex relationships between diet, the microbiota and internalizing symptoms is essential, as dietary intervention may also provide promising non-invasive point of intervention (Jacka et al., 2017).The present review revealed a higher abundance of Actinobacteria in MDD relative to controls (J. Chen et al., 2018;Z. Chen et al., 2018;Chung et al., 2019;Rong et al., 2019;P. Zheng et al., 2016), in line with a previous review (T.-T. Huang et al., 2019).

        <p>Finally, there are clear sex differences in the prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders, both being more common in females than males (World Health Organization, 2017). Sex differences in gut microbiota composition have also been suggested to underlie susceptibility to gut-microbiota mediated conditions in females (Z. Ma &amp; Li, 2019). As most reviewed studies failed to consider biological sex, we did not have the power to differentiate this in terms of microbiota-gut-brain axis contribution. In the few studies that examined males and females separately, significant differences were observed, sometimes with effects in opposite directions (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, Coriobacteriaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae incertae sedis; J. Chen et al., 2018). This is another likely factor contributing to heterogeneity across studies.Finally, there are clear sex differences in the prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders, both being more common in females than males (World Health Organization, 2017).

        <p>Poorer ratings were primarily due to unclear or inconsistent methods for recruitment, screening, and categorization of cases and controls, as well as insufficient consideration of confounding variables and the use of self-reported diagnosis as the primary method for determining anxiety/depression status. All case-control studies were also cross-sectional in nature (or assessed a longitudinal intervention not of interest), and only one study investigated relevant associations at multiple timepoints. Longitudinal studies are required to disentangle disorder-specific effects from baseline individual differences, and provide an indication of the direction of causality in the associations between anxiety, depression and the gut microbiota. The current literature is not able to disentangle whether differences in the gut microbiota are a cause or a consequence of disorder presence.Poorer ratings were primarily due to unclear or inconsistent methods for recruitment, screening, and categorization of cases and controls, as well as insufficient consideration of confounding variables and the use of self-reported diagnosis as the primary method for determining anxiety/depression status.

        <p>Despite technological advancements in recent years, microbiota research continues to face methodological challenges. The largest sources of inter-study variability remains heterogeneity in laboratory processing (e.g., DNA extraction kits, hypervariable region, sequencing platform), and in data pre-processing and analysis -the studies reviewed herein were no exception (Appendix B). Pre-processing techniques were particularly varied (e.g., taxonomic library for sequence comparison and quality control criteria for sequence reads).Despite technological advancements in recent years, microbiota research continues to face methodological challenges.

        <p>There are several additional factors that complicate replication and comparison of microbiota studies. There is ongoing discovery of novel bacterial species and strains, and constant updates reflect said changes in nomenclature or phylogenetic reclassification. A recent example includes the reclassification of Lactobacillus, among which 23 novel genera have been described and over 250 species now belong to a different genus (J. Zheng et al., 2020). Researchers must remain privy to constant updates to correctly interpret results of different taxa, which may in reality reflect the same genus/species. Finally, another notable methodological inconsistency included the method by which clinical groups were defined, including semi-structured interviews using varying diagnostic criteria (e.g., DSM-IV/5, ICD-10), symptom cut-off scores on questionnaires, or a selfreported history of anxiety or depression. This is problematic in downstream analyses, which often involve dichotomization into disorder present/absent groupings. Researchers should carefully consider how groups are defined, an additional consideration for mental health disorders not essential for medical conditions with clear biomarkers.There are several additional factors that complicate replication and comparison of microbiota studies.

        <p>The present review has some limitations which should be considered in future syntheses. Our searches aimed to capture studies examining gut microbiota composition, rather than species' function. Functional redundancy is often reported, whereby populations can cover identical functions and secrete the same metabolic products, despite varying in their microbial composition (Heintz-Buschart &amp; Wilmes, 2018). Accordingly, methods which examine microbial function are needed to more accurately capture host-microbe interactions.The present review has some limitations which should be considered in future syntheses.

        <p>Moreover, the most commonly utilized method for estimating the gut microbiota composition within the reviewed literature was 16S rRNA gene sequencing, which is unable to distinguish between species and some phylogenetically similar genera (Janda &amp; Abbott, 2007). Future reviews should investigate altered microbial function (e.g., using metabolomics and metagenomics), particularly if lower SCFA production and elevated peripheral inflammation remain central hypotheses for understanding associations between the gut microbiota and mental health. Furthermore, a meta-analysis was not feasible due to disparate sequencing and bioinformatics techniques. As this body of research expands, meta-analysis will be essential to disentangle whether null findings reflect an absence of associations, or are due to insufficient statistical power in light of small sample sizes. Studies are encouraged to deposit raw sequencing reads to enable application of standardized pre-processing pipelines, taxonomic re-assignment against uniform libraries, and re-analysis using standardized techniques.Moreover, the most commonly utilized method for estimating the gut microbiota composition within the reviewed literature was 16S rRNA gene sequencing, which is unable to distinguish between species and some phylogenetically similar genera (Janda &amp; Abbott, 2007).

        <p>Differential abundance analyses indicated that anxiety and depressive disorders may be characterized by a higher relative abundance of proinflammatory species, and a lower abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria.
