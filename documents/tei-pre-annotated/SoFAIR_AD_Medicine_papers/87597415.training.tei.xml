        <p>Objective: Machine learning classification has been the most important computational development in the last years to satisfy the primary need of clinicians for automatic early diagnosis and prognosis. Nowadays, Random Forest (RF) algorithm has been successfully applied for reducing high dimensional and multi-source data in many scientific realms. Our aim was to explore the state of the art of the application of RF on single and multi-modal neuroimaging data for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease.Objective: Machine learning classification has been the most important computational development in the last years to satisfy the primary need of clinicians for automatic early diagnosis and prognosis.

Our aim was to explore the state of the art of the application of RF on single and multi-modal neuroimaging data for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
        <p>Methods: A systematic review following PRISMA guidelines was conducted on this field of study. In particular, we constructed an advanced query using boolean operators as follows: ("random forest" OR "random forests") AND neuroimaging AND ("alzheimer's disease" OR alzheimer's OR alzheimer) AND (prediction OR classification). The query was then searched in four well-known scientific databases: Pubmed, Scopus, 
            <rs type="software">Google Scholar</rs> and Web of Science.
        </p>
        <p>Results: Twelve articles-published between the 2007 and 2017-have been included in this systematic review after a quantitative and qualitative selection. The lesson learnt from these works suggest that when RF was applied on multi-modal data for prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) conversion from the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), it produces one of the best accuracies to date. Moreover, the RF has important advantages in terms of robustness to overfitting, ability to handle highly non-linear data, stability in the presence of outliers and opportunity for efficient parallel processing mainly when applied on multi-modality neuroimaging data, such as, MRI morphometric, diffusion tensor imaging, and PET images.Results: Twelve articles-published between the 2007 and 2017-have been included in this systematic review after a quantitative and qualitative selection.

        <p>The Alzheimer's disease (AD), a common form of dementia, is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects mostly elderly people (Berchtold and Cotman, 1998). It is characterized by a decline in cognitive function, including progressive loss of memory, reasoning, and language (Collie and Maruff, 2000). Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate state between healthy aging and AD, which is not severe enough to interfere with daily life. Although not all MCI subjects develop to AD and they remain cognitively stable for many years, the incidence of progression is evaluated between 10 and 15% per year (Palmqvist et al., 2012). There is no generally accepted cure for AD, but several treatments exist for delaying its course. For this reason, it is extremely important to early detect the MCI subjects that are at imminent risk of conversion to AD.The Alzheimer's disease (AD), a common form of dementia, is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects mostly elderly people (Berchtold and Cotman, 1998).

        <p>The diagnosis of AD is based primarily on multiple variables and factors, such as, demographics and genetic information, neuropsychological tests, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, and brain imaging data. Moreover, for the assessment of the risk of conversion from MCI, the rate of change of these variables could represent a further source of knowledge. In particular, the neuroimaging technologies, such as, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), single photon emission tomography (SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET) have been widely and successfully applied in the study of MCI and AD (Greicius et al., 2004;Matsuda, 2007;Fripp et al., 2008;Frisoni et al., 2010;Acosta-Cabronero and Nestor, 2014). The choice of the neuroimaging modality depends on the duration and severity of the disease, for example when MRI could not reveal any brain alterations, fMRI, SPECT, or PET are able to assess metabolic abnormalities and DTI could be used for investigating the microstructural disruption of the white matter (WM).The diagnosis of AD is based primarily on multiple variables and factors, such as, demographics and genetic information, neuropsychological tests, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, and brain imaging data.

        <p>The high dimension of all the features considered in the diagnosis of AD and in the progression from MCI, and their complex interactions make it very difficult for humans to interpret the data. Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) represents a valuable automatic tool for supporting the clinicians by teaching to computers to predict incipient AD. Machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms have been proven to efficiently classify AD patients and healthy controls (HC) and to distinguish between stable MCI (sMCI) subjects and progressive MCI (pMCI) that converted to AD (Zhang et al., 2012;Falahati et al., 2014;Trzepacz et al., 2014). In general, the machine learning methods used on neuroimaging data rely on a single classifier, such as, the widely used Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), or Na√Øve Bayes. However, in the last years, ensembles algorithms resulted to be a reliable alternative to single classifiers showing better performance than the latter, especially when multi-modality variables are combined together. Although among all ensembles approaches Random Forest (RF) (Breiman, 2001) produced the best accuracies in many scientific fields (Menze et al., 2009;Calle et al., 2011;Chen et al., 2011) and in other neurological diseases (Sarica et al., 2017), it is still poorly applied in the prediction of AD, and only lately researchers payed their attention to it. In particular, RF showed important advantages over other methodologies regarding the ability to handle highly non-linearly correlated data, robustness to noise, tuning simplicity, and opportunity for efficient parallel processing (Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil, 2006). Moreover, RF presents another important characteristic: an intrinsic feature selection step, applied prior to the classification task, to reduce the variables space by giving an importance value to each feature.The high dimension of all the features considered in the diagnosis of AD and in the progression from MCI, and their complex interactions make it very difficult for humans to interpret the data.

        <p>For all these reasons, the main goal of this systematic review was to highlight the role of RF as the ideal candidate for handling the high-dimensional problem and the variable redundancy in the early diagnosis of AD. We sought to review the literature in this area to identify all the works that applied the RF algorithm on single and multi-modality neuroimaging data, eventually combined with demographics and genetic information, and with neuropsychological scores. Our aim was also to evaluate how well, in term of accuracy, RF was able to classify AD and to distinguish between sMCI and pMCI, and how its intrinsic feature selection procedure could improve this overall accuracy.For all these reasons, the main goal of this systematic review was to highlight the role of RF as the ideal candidate for handling the high-dimensional problem and the variable redundancy in the early diagnosis of AD.

        <p>RF (see Figure 1 for an illustration) is a collection or ensemble of Classification and Regression Trees (CART) (Breiman et al., 1984) trained on datasets of the same size as training set, called bootstraps, created from a random resampling on the training set itself. Once a tree is constructed, a set of bootstraps, which do not include any particular record from the original dataset [out-of-bag (OOB) samples], is used as test set. The error rate of the classification of all the test sets is the OOB estimate of the generalization error. Breiman (1996) showed by empirical evidence that, for the bagged classifiers, the OOB error is accurate as using a test set of the same size as the training set. Thus, using the OOB estimate removes the need for a separate test set.RF (see Figure 1 for an illustration) is a collection or ensemble of Classification and Regression Trees (CART) (Breiman et al., 1984) trained on datasets of the same size as training set, called bootstraps, created from a random resampling on the training set itself.

        <p>RF follows specific rules for tree growing, tree combination, self-testing and post-processing, it is robust to overfitting and it is considered more stable in the presence of outliers and in very high dimensional parameter spaces than other machine learning algorithms (Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil, 2006;Menze et al., 2009). The concept of variable importance is an implicit feature selection performed by RF with a random subspace methodology, and it is assessed by the Gini impurity criterion index (Ceriani and Verme, 2012). The Gini index is a measure of prediction power of variables in regression or classification, based on the principle of impurity reduction (Strobl et al., 2007); it is non-parametric and therefore does not rely on data belonging to a particular type of distribution. For a binary split (white circles in Figure 1), the Gini index of a node n is calculated as follows:RF follows specific rules for tree growing, tree combination, self-testing and post-processing, it is robust to overfitting and it is considered more stable in the presence of outliers and in very high dimensional parameter spaces than other machine learning algorithms (Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil, 2006;Menze et al., 2009).

        <p>For splitting a binary node in the best way, the improvement in the Gini index should be maximized. In other words, a low Gini (i.e., a greater decrease in Gini) means that a particular predictor feature plays a greater role in partitioning the data into the two classes. Thus, the Gini index can be used to rank the importance of features for a classification problem.For splitting a binary node in the best way, the improvement in the Gini index should be maximized.

        <p>Gray et al. ( 2013) selected a cohort of 147 subjects from the ADNI database, consisting of 37 AD patients (mean age 76.8, 14 females, CDR = 0.5/1), 75 MCI patients divided into 34 stable MCI (sMCI, mean age 75.7, 12 females, CDR = 0.5) and 41 subjects progressed to AD (pMCI, mean age 76.1, 12 females, CDR = 0.5), and 35 HC (HC, mean age 74.5, 12 females, CDR = 0). All subjects underwent morphological 1.5T MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF analysis at the baseline and authors used already pre-processed data by ADNI. In particular, structural MRI and FDG-PET images were motion-corrected, examined for major artifacts and registered to the standard space MNI. Eighty-three volumetric region-based features were extracted from MRI, while signal intensities of 239,304 voxels were obtained from FDG-PET. Biological features were CSF-derived measures of AŒ≤, tau, and ptau. Furthermore, a categorical variable describing the ApoE genotype was used as genetic feature. Three different binary datasets were used for the RF classification: AD vs. HC, MCI vs. HC, sMCI vs. pMCI. The performance of each classifiers was evaluated with a stratified repeated random sampling approach, where, in each of the 100 runs, the dataset was divided into training (75%) and test set (25%). Accuracy on the test set was then calculated as the mean of all the 100 repetitions. The RF models were trained with 5,000 trees on the feature data from each of the four modalities independently and the feature importance ranking was extracted. As further analysis, authors measured the similarity between pairs of examples from the RF classifiers and applied a Manifold learning approach on data from single-modality and on combined/concatenated features (multi-modality).Gray et al. ( 2013) selected a cohort of 147 subjects from the ADNI database, consisting of 37 AD patients (mean age 76.8, 14 females, CDR = 0.5/1), 75 MCI patients divided into 34 stable MCI (sMCI, mean age 75.7, 12 females, CDR = 0.5) and 41 subjects progressed to AD (pMCI, mean age 76.1, 12 females, CDR = 0.5), and 35 HC (HC, mean age 74.5, 12 females, CDR = 0). All subjects underwent morphological 1.5T MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF analysis at the baseline and authors used already pre-processed data by ADNI. In particular, structural MRI and FDG-PET images were motion-corrected, examined for major artifacts and registered to the standard space MNI. Eighty-three volumetric region-based features were extracted from MRI, while signal intensities of 239,304 voxels were obtained from FDG-PET. Biological features were CSF-derived measures of AŒ≤, tau, and ptau. Furthermore, a categorical variable describing the ApoE genotype was used as genetic feature. Three different binary datasets were used for the RF classification: AD vs. HC, MCI vs. HC, sMCI vs. pMCI. The performance of each classifiers was evaluated with a stratified repeated random sampling approach, where, in each of the 100 runs, the dataset was divided into training (75%) and test set (25%). Accuracy on the test set was then calculated as the mean of all the 100 repetitions. The RF models were trained with 5,000 trees on the feature data from each of the four modalities independently and the feature importance ranking was extracted.

A slight increase of the accuracy was obtained with the multi-modality classification for AD vs. HC (+2.6%) and for MCI vs. HC (+0.8%), while for pMCI vs. sMCI there was a small decrease (-0.4%).Although the single-modality classification results were comparable between the original dataset and the embedded feature one, the latter presented the best performances as following: 86.4% for the AD vs. HC with the FDG-PET data, 73.8% for MCI vs. HC with the genetic data, 58.4% for the sMCI vs. pMCI with MRI data.

Authors analyzed FDG-PET data, acquired 24 months after the first visit and already preprocessed by ADNI. In particular, they used the voxel intensities (VI) as features of interest, for a total of 309,881 variables. The original dataset was decomposed by using the one-vs.-all scheme, resulting into three subsets: AD vs. ALL, MCI vs. ALL, HC vs. ALL. The Mutual Information criterion was used for extracting the optimal features with the highest ranking value, separately for each pairwise problem. The selected features were then used for training three binary RF models with 100 trees. As aggregation scheme for the ternary problem, the voting strategy (MAX) was applied. The classification performance was then assessed by the 10-fold cross-validation accuracy, repeated 5 times with fold randomization.

The performance of models-with and without RFE-was evaluated as the overall accuracy on a separate test set with 35 AD and 75 HC. Findings revealed that the highest accuracy (90.3%) for the classifier AD vs. HC was obtained with the RFE on the combined dataset with thickness and non-cortical volumes. An increase of 0.7% was found in this accuracy when authors combined all models by a majority vote approach. The majority vote method resulted to have also the best ability to predict MCI-to-AD conversion 2 years before actual dementia onset with sensitivity/specificity of 76.6/75%. As further analysis, authors found that the adding of ApoE genotype and demographics data did not improve the overall accuracy in distinguishing AD from HC, while it showed an increase of sensitivity/specificity (83.3/81.3%) in the prediction of MCI conversion.The feature importance was assessed with the intrinsic characteristic of RF consisting of the recursive feature elimination (RFE) with the Gini index as criterion and 10,000 trees.

(2017) was obtained from ADNI database and it consisted of 150 subjects divided into three groups: 50 AD, 50 MCI, and 50 HC with an age range from 55 to 90. Diffusion-weighted scans acquired with a 3 T scanner was used for this machine learning study, randomly selected from the baseline and follow-up visit. DTIs were pre-processed for correction of movement artifacts and eddy currents with a standard pipeline. A diffusion tensor was fitted for each subject and fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusion (MD) maps were extracted. The FA and MD maps were then used as input for a tract-based spatial statistics (
            <rs type="software">TBSS</rs>) analysis, which-for each subject -produced ‚àº120,000 voxels for each diffusion metric.
        </p>
        <p>In a first phase, authors assessed the importance value of the voxels in discriminating AD from HC with two different feature selection methods: the Wilcoxon rank sum test and the ReliefF algorithm, which were used both within a non-nested and nested approach. For the classification task, fifteen subsets were then created by selecting an increasing number-from 50 to 3,000-of most discriminating voxels, ordered by decreasing importance. RF models were trained with 300 trees on each of these feature subspaces and their performance was evaluated with a repeated (100 runs) 5-fold cross-validation accuracy.In a first phase, authors assessed the importance value of the voxels in discriminating AD from HC with two different feature selection methods: the Wilcoxon rank sum test and the ReliefF algorithm, which were used both within a non-nested and nested approach.

        <p>The models built on the FA features selected with the nonnested approach showed the highest accuracies in both binary problems, AD vs. HC (87%) and MCI vs. HC (81%). The nonnested variable selection resulted to produce better results than the nested one also when MD voxels were used for training the classifiers (83% for AD vs. MCI and 79% for MCI vs. HC).The models built on the FA features selected with the nonnested approach showed the highest accuracies in both binary problems, AD vs. HC (87%) and MCI vs. HC (81%).

        <p>A sample of 105 subjects was selected by Son et al. (2017) from the ADNI database. The cohort was divided into three agesex-matched groups: 30 AD (mean age 74, 18 females), 40 MCI (mean age 74.3, 21 females) and 35 HC (mean age 76.06, 23 females). All participants underwent 3 T acquisition of T1w images and resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). Structural scans were pre-processed for correcting movement artifacts and smoothed, and then they were segmented into WM, GM, and CSF. The volumes of 10 subcortical regions were calculated as measure of atrophy. The rs-fMRI images were pre-processed and registered onto the T1-w and aligned to the MNI standard space. Given a set of ROIs from the AAL atlas as nodes, the functional networks were constructed by defying the edges as correlation values between nodes. Authors quantified the connectivity of the functional networks within the 10 subcortical regions with the eigenvector centrality measure among AD and HC, MCI and HC, and AD and MCI.A sample of 105 subjects was selected by Son et al.

        <p>The ternary problem, AD vs. MCI vs. HC, was evaluated by training a RF classifier with the SV and the eigenvector centrality measures as features. The multi-class accuracy of the RF model was assessed with a repeated (105 runs) leave-one-out cross-validation approach. Authors reached a poor performance (accuracy: 53.33%) in distinguishing among AD, MCI, and HC subjects. However, they identified distinctive regional atrophy and functional connectivity patterns characterizing each binary problem AD vs. HC (thalamus, putamen and hippocampus bilaterally and left amygdala), MCI vs. HC (left putamen and right hippocampus), and MCI vs. AD (bilateral hippocampus and right amygdala).The ternary problem, AD vs. MCI vs. HC, was evaluated by training a RF classifier with the SV and the eigenvector centrality measures as features.

        <p>RF has been successfully applied in many scientific realms such as, the bioinformatics, proteomics, and genetics (Menze et al., 2009;Calle et al., 2011;Chen et al., 2011), but it was less applied on neuroimaging data for the prediction of the Azheimer's disease. The present paper is the first, to our knowledge, that systematically analyzed the literature of the last 10 years on the use of the RF algorithm on neuroimaging data for the early diagnosis of AD. In this review, we summarized the characteristics of twelve works (Tripoliti et al., 2007;Cabral et al., 2013;Gray et al., 2013;Lebedev et al., 2014;Moradi et al., 2015;Oppedal et al., 2015;Sivapriya et al., 2015;Wang et al., 2016;Ardekani et al., 2017;Lebedeva et al., 2017;Maggipinto et al., 2017;Son et al., 2017) by focusing our attention on performance reached by their algorithms.RF has been successfully applied in many scientific realms such as, the bioinformatics, proteomics, and genetics (Menze et al., 2009;Calle et al., 2011;Chen et al., 2011), but it was less applied on neuroimaging data for the prediction of the Azheimer's disease.

        <p>A direct comparison of the results of the selected works is influenced by several factors, such as, the different sample sizes, neuroimaging modalities, and different methods for the feature selection. However, we found several points in common among papers, such as, similar performance validation approaches, as well as a general trend showing that the classification based on a combination of features extracted from different categories improved the ability in predicting AD. Another important common aspect of the selected articles is the use of data from the ADNI database. Indeed, 10 works (Cabral et al., 2013;Gray et al., 2013;Lebedev et al., 2014;Moradi et al., 2015;Sivapriya et al., 2015;Wang et al., 2016;Ardekani et al., 2017;Lebedeva et al., 2017;Maggipinto et al., 2017;Son et al., 2017) applied their methodologies on ADNI cohorts.A direct comparison of the results of the selected works is influenced by several factors, such as, the different sample sizes, neuroimaging modalities, and different methods for the feature selection.

        <p>The best accuracies-around 90%-for the binary problem AD vs. HC, were observed when the RF classifiers were trained on high-dimensional and multi-modality data (Tripoliti et al., 2007;Cabral et al., 2013;Gray et al., 2013;Lebedev et al., 2014). Superior performance of these models can be explained by the ability of RF to detect less extensive changes in the variables, which could be not revealed by others algorithms. Moreover, Moradi et al. (2015) showed that RF was more immune to the data type thanks to its capability to handle discrete data and to apply an efficient discretization algorithm on continuous data type before the learning step.The best accuracies-around 90%-for the binary problem AD vs. HC, were observed when the RF classifiers were trained on high-dimensional and multi-modality data (Tripoliti et al., 2007;Cabral et al., 2013;Gray et al., 2013;Lebedev et al., 2014).

        <p>The binary models for distinguishing MCI from HC and stable MCI from progressive MCI showed lower accuracies, around 82%, although it was similarly improved by multi-modal data classification (Figure 3). In particular, the inclusion of age as well as cognitive measurements (MMSE and ADAS-cog), in the space of features, significantly increased the classification of MCI vs. HC (Gray et al., 2013;Lebedeva et al., 2017;Maggipinto et al., 2017) and the AD conversion prediction in MCI patients (Moradi et al., 2015;Wang et al., 2016;Ardekani et al., 2017). On the contrary, for the conundrum between sMCI vs. pMCI, Gray et al. (2013) found that the accuracy reached on multi-modality classification is not significantly different from that obtained with MRI information alone. Interestingly, authors suggested that the lack of improvement in distinguishing the progression to AD, could be overcame by incorporating longitudinal information, as indeed Ardekani et al. (2017) demonstrated afterwards by considering the rate of change of variables.The binary models for distinguishing MCI from HC and stable MCI from progressive MCI showed lower accuracies, around 82%, although it was similarly improved by multi-modal data classification (Figure 3).

        <p>Three works (Cabral et al., 2013;Sivapriya et al., 2015;Son et al., 2017) investigated the ternary problem: AD vs. MCI vs. HC, but only the work of Sivapriya et al. (2015) reached a reliable accuracy of 96.3%. The low performance of the other two studies-64.63% of Cabral et al. (2013) and 53.33% of Son et al. (2017)-might be due to the heterogeneous pattern of brain changes across the three groups and the inability of RF to model the too large variability in the stages of pathological process. Thus, although RF can be naturally extended to multiclass problems, the AD vs. MCI vs. HC ternary model could not be still translated into a real-world clinical scenario.Three works (Cabral et al., 2013;Sivapriya et al., 2015;Son et al., 2017) investigated the ternary problem: AD vs. MCI vs. HC, but only the work of Sivapriya et al.

        <p>Another interesting observation was that, both in binary and ternary problems, feature selection based on the Gini index, improved the overall performance and this is true also for the works in which only a neuroimaging modality was used (Lebedev et al., 2014;Ardekani et al., 2017;Lebedeva et al., 2017;Maggipinto et al., 2017). Other kinds of feature selection and extraction, applied prior to the RF classification, showed also an improvement in the overall accuracies (Tripoliti et al., 2007;Cabral et al., 2013;Moradi et al., 2015;Oppedal et al., 2015;Sivapriya et al., 2015;Wang et al., 2016;Ardekani et al., 2017;Lebedeva et al., 2017;Maggipinto et al., 2017).Another interesting observation was that, both in binary and ternary problems, feature selection based on the Gini index, improved the overall performance and this is true also for the works in which only a neuroimaging modality was used (Lebedev et al., 2014;Ardekani et al., 2017;Lebedeva et al., 2017;Maggipinto et al., 2017).

        <p>A further interesting characteristic of the RF algorithm in the AD realm was the estimates of the features importance. The ranking of the variables plays an important role because it could assess which of the features contribute most to the prediction by also providing a correspondence to anatomical regions or structures with a biologically plausible connection to pathology (Gray et al., 2013;Lebedev et al., 2014;Moradi et al., 2015;Ardekani et al., 2017).A further interesting characteristic of the RF algorithm in the AD realm was the estimates of the features importance.

        <p>A limitation of this systematic review concerns the lack of information about the tuning of the RF parameters. In particular, poor information were reported in the selected works about how the number and depth of trees in the forest or the splitting criteria were chosen. Although, this tuning is performed automatically by RF, how external assessment of these parameters (i.e., crossvalidation approach) would improve the overall accuracies is still unknown.A limitation of this systematic review concerns the lack of information about the tuning of the RF parameters.

        <p>Again, what still remains to be assessed is the performance of RF algorithm on multi-site data. As already demonstrated for rs-fMRI datasets from different sites (Abraham et al., 2017;Dansereau et al., 2017), the accuracy and the reliability of the biomarkers extraction could be enhanced by dramatically increasing the cohort size. Moreover, it was shown that classifiers trained on data from multiple sources will likely generalize better to new observations (Dansereau et al., 2017), avoiding the overfitting. Thus, it would be interesting to evaluate how well RF could classify when it is trained on features that are not invariant across sites and how the sample heterogeneity influences its performance.Again, what still remains to be assessed is the performance of RF algorithm on multi-site data.

        <p>This systematic review provided, for the first time, a framework for the exploration of the RF algorithm and of its strength in predicting AD when high-dimensional and multimodal neuroimaging data are combined with demographics, genetic and cognitive scores. Indeed, as recently stated by Rathore et al. (2017), no single neuroimaging modality is enough to reach optimal accuracy for automatic AD prediction, but only through the combination of different methodologies, the classification task could be effectively translated into the clinical realm. Our work supported the idea that there is some complementary information between modalities and that this knowledge can be successfully explored with a combination of classifiers rather than a single one. The RF, as a bagging ensemble model, provided promising results, but with possible limitations. Thus, given the high accuracies reached by RF in the classification of dementia, we aimed at encouraging further studies, especially for comparing and integrating this algorithm with other machine learning approaches, such as, the deep learning, which recently showed its potentiality in the investigation of neuroimaging correlates (Shen et al., 2017;Vieira et al., 2017). In the future, the aggregation of multiapproaches (RF, Deep-learning and SVM), multimodal (MRI, DTI, PET) and multi-sites data would drastically increase our ability to extract reliable biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases.This systematic review provided, for the first time, a framework for the exploration of the RF algorithm and of its strength in predicting AD when high-dimensional and multimodal neuroimaging data are combined with demographics, genetic and cognitive scores.
