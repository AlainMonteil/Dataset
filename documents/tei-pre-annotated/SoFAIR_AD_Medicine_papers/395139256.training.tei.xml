        <p>Introduction: Cytotoxic agents have immunomodulatory effects, providing a rationale for combining atezolizumab (anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [anti-PD-L1]) with chemotherapy. The randomized phase III IMpower131 study (NCT02367794) evaluated atezolizumab with platinum-based chemotherapy in stage IV squamous NSCLC.</p>
        <p>Methods: A total of 1021 patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive atezolizumabþcarboplatinþpaclitaxel (AþCP) (n ¼ 338), atezolizumabþcarboplatinþnab-paclitaxel (AþCnP) (n ¼ 343), or carboplatinþnab-paclitaxel (CnP) (n ¼ 340) for four or six 21-day cycles; patients randomized to the AþCP or AþCnP arms received atezolizumab maintenance therapy until progressive disease or loss of clinical benefit. The coprimary end points were investigatorassessed progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. The secondary end points included PFS and OS in PD-L1 subgroups and safety. The primary PFS (January 22, 2018) and final OS (October 3, 2018) for AþCnP versus CnP are reported.</p>
        <p>Results: PFS improvement with AþCnP versus CnP was seen in the ITT population (median, 6.3 versus 5.6 mo; hazard ratio [HR] ¼ 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.60-0.85; p ¼ 0.0001). Median OS in the ITT population was 14.2 and 13.5 months in the AþCnP and CnP arms (HR ¼ 0.88, 95% CI: 0.73-1.05; p ¼ 0.16), not reaching statistical significance. OS improvement with AþCnP versus CnP was observed in the PD-L1-high subgroup (HR ¼ 0.48, 95% CI: 0.29-0.81), despite not being formally tested. Treatment-related grade 3 and 4 adverse events and serious adverse events occurred in 68.0% and 47.9% (AþCnP) and 57.5% and 28.7% (CnP) of patients, respectively.</p>
        <p>Conclusions: Adding atezolizumab to platinum-based chemotherapy significantly improved PFS in patients with first-line squamous NSCLC; OS was similar between the arms.</p>
        <p>Platinum-based chemotherapy remains a first-line treatment option for many patients with advanced squamous NSCLC, which accounts for 25% to 30% of lung cancers. [1][2][3] Nevertheless, these treatment options provide limited efficacy, with a median overall survival (OS) of less than 1 year. 3 More recently, the introduction of pembrolizumab to platinum-based chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC has led to significant improvement in OS, with a median of 15.9 months. 4 In patients with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on greater than or equal to 1% of tumor cells (TCs), pembrolizumab monotherapy has resulted in significant OS improvement compared to that observed with platinumbased chemotherapy, 5 representing a chemotherapy-free treatment option.</p>
        <p>A significant OS benefit with atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1 antibody) versus docetaxel was reported in patients with previously treated NSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 expression or tumor histology. 6 On the basis of these and other data, atezolizumab monotherapy was approved for patients with metastatic NSCLC that progressed during or after platinum-based chemotherapy. 7,8 In the first-line setting, atezolizumab monotherapy has resulted in significant OS improvement compared to that observed with platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with high PD-L1 levels (!50% TCs or !10% tumorinfiltrating immune cells [ICs]) independent of tumor histology. 9 Cytotoxic agents can exhibit positive immunomodulatory effects by releasing high levels of tumor antigens and reinstating immunosurveillance, suggesting that chemotherapy may enhance atezolizumab's antitumor activity. 10 The phase III IMpower130 study reported that the addition of atezolizumab to carboplatin and nabpaclitaxel for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC provided a clinically meaningful and statistically significant benefit in OS and progression-free survival (PFS) versus chemotherapy alone; thus, this atezolizumab regimen received approval in the United States and the European Union. [11][12][13] Furthermore, in the IMpower150 study, the addition of atezolizumab to bevacizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC provided significant improvements in PFS and OS, resulting in the approval of the regimen in this patient population. 14,15 Here, the efficacy and safety from the phase III IMpower131 study (NCT02367794), which evaluated the combination of atezolizumab and carboplatin-taxane doublet chemotherapy as first-line therapy in patients with stage IV squamous NSCLC, are reported.</p>
        <p>In the global, open-label, phase III IMpower131 study, the patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive atezolizumabþcarboplatinþpaclitaxel (AþCP), atezolizumabþcarboplatinþnab-paclitaxel (AþCnP), or carboplatinþnab-paclitaxel (CnP). Stratification factors were sex (male or female), presence of liver metastases (yes or no), and PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry (TC3 and any IC versus TC0/1/2 and IC2/3 versus TC0/1/2 and IC0/1). The patients received four or six 21-day cycles of induction treatment (number of cycles per investigator discretion, chosen before therapy initiation). Atezolizumab was administered at 1200 mg intravenously (IV; day 1), carboplatin at an area under the concentrationÀtime curve of 6 mg/mL/min IV (day 1), paclitaxel at 200 mg/m 2 IV (175 mg/m 2 for Asian race/ethnicity; day 1), and nab-paclitaxel at 100 mg/m 2 IV (days 1, 8, and 15). After induction, patients in the AþCP and AþCnP arms continued atezolizumab until disease progression per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 or loss of clinical benefit. Crossover to atezolizumab was not allowed.</p>
        <p>Eligible patients had histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IV squamous NSCLC per the seventh edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer/ Union for International Cancer Control TNM Staging system, 16 had not received chemotherapy for stage IV squamous NSCLC, had measurable disease per the RECIST version 1.1, had a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 or 1, and had tumor tissue available for central PD-L1 testing. Patients known to have EGFR mutations or ALK fusion oncogene were eligible for the study but had to have experienced disease progression on or intolerance to one or more approved tyrosine kinases or ALK inhibitors, respectively; testing for EGFR and ALK status was not mandated. Exclusion criteria included active or untreated central nervous system metastases; history of autoimmune disease; previous immune checkpoint blockade therapies with the exception of anti-CTLA-4 therapy, provided the last dose was given more than or equal to 6 weeks before randomization; and systemic immunosuppressive medications less than 2 weeks before randomization.</p>
        <p>The coprimary end points were investigator-assessed PFS per the RECIST version 1.1 and OS in the intentionto-treat (ITT) population. The secondary end points included investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), PFS, and OS evaluated in PD-L1 subgroups (defined as TC2/3 or IC2/3 and TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3) and in the T-effector (Teff) population. Additional PD-L1 subpopulations were explored: TC3 or IC3 (high expression), TC1/2 or IC1/2 (low expression), and TC0 and IC0 (negative). Baseline PD-L1 tumor expression was evaluated in archival tissue or tissue obtained from a biopsy at screening using the SP142 PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assay (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., Tucson, AZ) and was scored by a central laboratory, as previously described 6 (Supplementary Table 1). The Teff gene signature was defined by the average expression of CD274, CXCL9, and IFNg in RNA isolated from tumor tissue and was measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction relative to the expression of a control gene (Roche Molecular Systems, Pleasanton, CA). The Teff population was defined as patients in the ITT population with a Teff signature score greater than or equal to À1.91.</p>
        <p>The safety and tolerability of the study treatment were evaluated, and adverse events (AEs) were assessed per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for AEs version 4.0. Tumor assessments were performed at baseline, every 6 weeks for the first 48 weeks after cycle 1, day 1, and every 9 weeks thereafter until disease progression per the RECIST version 1.1 or loss of clinical benefit for patients who continued atezolizumab after initial disease progression.</p>
        <p>The coprimary end points of PFS and OS in the ITT population were tested first between the AþCnP and CnP arms (Supplementary Fig. 2). To control the type I error rate at 0.05 (two-sided), the alpha was split and a two-sided alpha of 0.006 and 0.044 was allocated to PFS and OS, respectively. If PFS was statistically significant, the alpha would be recycled, and OS would be tested at a two-sided significance level of 0.05. Only if OS between the AþCnP and CnP arms was statistically significant would PFS and OS be tested with alpha allocation between the AþCP and CnP arms (Supplementary Fig. 8). At the time of the primary PFS analysis, the first planned interim analysis of OS was performed. For the first interim analysis of OS, a nominal alpha (0.0001) was spent.</p>
        <p>Stratified log-rank tests were used for treatment comparisons of PFS and OS, using the same stratification factors as those for randomization (sex, baseline liver metastases, and PD-L1 status). Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to estimate median PFS and median OS for each treatment arm. Brookmeyer-Crowley methodology was used to calculate 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the medians. A stratified Cox regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs). Analyses of prespecified subgroups were performed using unstratified HRs estimated from Cox proportional hazard models and Kaplan-Meier estimates.</p>

        <p>A total of 1021 patients were enrolled at 317 study sites across 26 countries between June 2015 and March 2017 and comprised the ITT population. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive AþCP (n ¼ 338), AþCnP (n ¼ 343), or CnP (n ¼ 340) (Supplementary Fig. 1). The clinical cutoff date (CCOD) was January 22, 2018, for the primary PFS analysis and October 3, 2018, for the final OS analysis. Overall, 82% of patients (n ¼ 835) were male, 92% (n ¼ 935) were current or previous smokers, 33% (n ¼ 334) had a baseline ECOG PS of 0, and 67% (n ¼ 685) had a baseline ECOG PS of 1 (Table 1). The median age was 65 years (range, 23-86). One patient in the AþCnP arm had an EGFR mutation; for all other patients, the EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement status were either negative or unknown. In the AþCP arm, 48 (14.2%), 120 (35.5%), and 170 patients (50.3%) had tumors with high (TC3 or IC3), low (TC1/2 or IC1/ 2), and negative (TC0 and IC0) PD-L1 expression, respectively. A total of 47 (13.7%), 136 (39.7%), and 160 patients (46.6%) in the AþCnP arm and 44 (12.9%), 125 (36.8%), and 171 patients (50.3%) in the CnP arm had tumors with high, low, and negative PD-L1 expression, respectively.</p>
        <p>At primary CCOD (January 22, 2018), median followup was 18.1 months in the AþCnP arm and 16.1 months in the CnP arm. In the ITT population, 270 patients (78.7%) in the AþCnP arm and 289 patients (85.0%) in the CnP arm had a PFS event per investigator assessment. PFS benefit was found with AþCnP versus CnP in the ITT population (stratified HR ¼ 0.71, 95% CI: 0.60-0.85; p ¼ 0.0001) (Fig. 1A), with a median PFS of 6.3 months (95% CI: 5.7-7.1) in the AþCnP arm and 5.6 months (95% CI: 5.5-5.7) in the CnP arm. The 12-month PFS rate was 24.7% in the AþCnP arm versus 12.0% in the CnP arm. The PFS in the clinical subgroups within the ITT population is reported in Supplementary Figure 3. The PFS according to PD-L1 expression status and Teff gene signature is presented in Table 2. Although the PFS in the PD-L1 expression subgroups was not formally tested, patients whose tumors had the highest PD-L1 expression level (TC3 or IC3) had a more pronounced benefit with AþCnP than those treated with CnP did (median PFS was 10.1 versus 5.1 mo in the AþCnP versus CnP arms; HR ¼ 0.41; 95% CI: 0.25-0.68). PFS in the ITT population assessed by an independent review facility resulted in a median PFS of 6.9 months in the AþCnP arm and 5.7 months in the CnP arm (stratified HR ¼ 0.80, 95% CI: 0.67-0.96) (Supplementary Fig. 5). Updated investigator-assessed PFS for the ITT population with a CCOD of October 3, 2018, is shown in the supplementary data (Supplementary Fig. 6).</p>
        <p>At the final OS analysis (CCOD: October 3, 2018), median follow-up was 26.8 months in the AþCnP arm and 24.8 months in the CnP arm. There were 228 (66.5%) and 245 (72.1%) deaths in the AþCnP and CnP arms, respectively. Median OS in the ITT population was similar between the AþCnP and CnP arms: 14.2 months (95% CI: 12.3-16.8) and 13.5 months (95% CI: 12.2-15.1), respectively (stratified HR ¼ 0.88, 95% CI: 0.73-1.05; p ¼ 0.1581) (Fig. 1B, Supplementary Fig. 4). At 24 months, 32.5% and 26.6% of patients in the AþCnP and CnP arms, respectively, were alive. OS in the clinical subgroups within the ITT population is reported in Supplementary Figure 4. OS according to PD-L1 expression status and Teff gene signature is presented in Table 3. In the high PD-L1 expression subgroup (TC3 or IC3), median OS was 23.4 months in the AþCnP arm versus 10.2 months in the CnP arm (HR ¼ 0.48, 95% CI: 0.29-0.81) (Table 3). As the OS boundary for significance was not crossed between the AþCnP and CnP arms in the ITT population, PFS and OS were not formally tested between the AþCP and CnP arms.</p>
        <p>After discontinuation of study treatment, 124 patients (36.2%) in the AþCnP arm and 198 patients (58.2%) in the CnP arm received subsequent anticancer therapies (Supplementary Table 2). In the AþCnP arm, 110 patients (32.1%) received subsequent chemotherapy and 22 patients (6.4%) received subsequent cancer immunotherapy. In the CnP arm, 93 patients (27.4%) received subsequent chemotherapy and 147 patients (43.2%) received subsequent cancer immunotherapy. In both arms, nivolumab was the most frequently administered cancer immunotherapy after the end of study treatment (Supplementary Table 2). OS data from the first (CCOD: January 22, 2018) and second (CCOD: April 20, 2018) interim analyses are included in the supplementary data (Supplementary Figs. 7 and8).</p>
        <p>At the final CCOD (October 3, 2018), confirmed investigator-assessed ORR in the ITT population was 49.7% in the AþCnP arm and 41.0% in the CnP arm, with a median DOR of 7.3 months (95% CI: 6.8-9.5) and 5.2 months (95% CI: 4.4-5.6), respectively (Supplementary Table 3). A total of 37 patients (21.8%) in the AþCnP arm and 16 patients (11.5%) in the CnP arm had ongoing responses at the time of clinical cutoff. Overall, ORR and DOR at the final analysis were consistent with those from the primary analysis 17 (January 22, 2018). In the subgroup of patients with high PD-L1 expression (TC3 or IC3), ORR was 61.7% with AþCnP and 31.8% with CnP, and median DOR was 13.6 and 5.5 months, respectively (Supplementary Table 3). In the PD-L1-low (TC1/2 or IC1/2) and PD-L1-negative (TC0 and IC0) subgroups, ORR was 52.6% with AþCnP and 43.5% with CnP and 43.8% with AþCnP and 41.5% with CnP, respectively.</p>
        <p>A total of 332 patients in the AþCP arm and 334 patients each in the AþCnP and CnP arms had received any amount of study treatment and were included in the safety population. At the time of the final CCOD (October 3, 2018), the median treatment duration of atezolizumab was 5.5 months (range, 0-37) in the AþCP arm, with a median of eight cycles (range, 1-55), and 6.7 months (range, 0-37) in the AþCnP arm, with a median of 10 cycles (range, 1-51). Median carboplatin treatment duration was 2.2 months (range, 0-5) in the AþCP arm, Any-cause AEs of any grade occurred in 325 patients (97.9%) in the AþCP arm, 332 patients (99.4%) in the AþCnP arm, and 324 patients (97.0%) in the CnP arm (Table 4). Any-cause serious AEs occurred in 143 patients (43.1%) in the AþCP arm, 160 patients (47.9%) in AþCnP arm, and 96 patients (28.7%) in the CnP arm. A total of 28 patients (8.4%) in the AþCP arm, 34 patients (10.2%) in the AþCnP arm, and 14 patients (4.2%) in the CnP arm had a grade 5 AE of any cause. The higher incidence of serious AEs observed in the atezolizumabcontaining arms was mainly driven by respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (AþCP, 15.7%; AþCnP, 12.3%; CnP, 6.6%), particularly pneumonitis (AþCP, 3.3%; AþCnP, 3.0%; CnP, 0.6%), and by blood and lymphatic system disorders (AþCP, 6.9%; AþCnP, 7.2%; CnP, 3.9%), mainly febrile neutropenia (AþCP, 4.8%; AþCnP, 3.9%; CnP, 1.5%) and anemia (AþCP, 1.8%; AþCnP, 2.1%; CnP, 0.9%). AEs led to withdrawal of any treatment in 88 patients (26.5%) in the AþCP arm, 102 patients (30.5%) in the AþCnP arm, and 58 patients (17.4%) in the CnP arm.</p>
        <p>Treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) of any grade occurred in 306 patients (92.2%) in the AþCP arm, 316 patients (94.6%) in the AþCnP arm, and 303 patients (90.7%) in the CnP arm (Tables 4 and5). The most common grade 3 and 4 TRAEs (!10% incidence in any arm) were anemia (AþCP, 9.3%; AþCnP, 22.2%; CnP, 20.7%), neutropenia (AþCP, 7.5%; AþCnP, 21.3%; CnP, 22.5%), febrile neutropenia (AþCP, 7.5%; AþCnP, 5.4%; CnP, 2.1%), thrombocytopenia (AþCP, 4.2%; AþCnP, 9.3%; CnP, 8.1%), and decreased neutrophil count (AþCP, 4.8%; AþCnP, 10.8%; CnP, 13.8%) (Table 5). Serious TRAEs occurred in 77 patients (23.2%) in the AþCP arm, 70 patients (21.0%) in the AþCnP arm, and 35 patients (10.5%) in the CnP arm (Table 4 and Supplementary Table 4). The most common grade 3 and 4 serious TRAEs (!2% incidence in any arm) were febrile neutropenia (AþCP, 4.5%; AþCnP, 3.9%; CnP, 1.5%) and pneumonitis (AþCP, 2.4%; AþCnP, 0.9%; CnP, 0.6%) (Supplementary Table 4). Nine patients (2.7%) in the AþCP arm, four patients (1.2%) in the AþCnP arm, and three patients (0.9%) in the CnP arm had treatment-related grade 5 AEs (Supplementary Table 5).</p>
        <p>Most immune-related AEs were grade 1 and 2 in all the treatment arms. The most common immune-related AEs (!5% incidence in any arm) were rash (AþCP, 24.7%; AþCnP, 23.1%; CnP, 11.7%), abnormal hepatic function (AþCP, 16.9%; AþCnP, 17.7%; CnP, 8.1%), hypothyroidism (AþCP, 10.5%; AþCnP, 11.1%; CnP, 0.9%), and pneumonitis (AþCP, 7.5%; AþCnP, 7.5%; CnP, 1.5%) (Supplementary Table 6). Two patients in the AþCP arm experienced a grade 5 immune-related AE: one case of Guillain-Barré syndrome and one of pneumonitis. In the AþCnP arm, one patient had a grade 5 immune-related AE of abnormal hepatic function.</p>
        <p>IMpower131 met its coprimary end point of investigator-assessed PFS in the ITT population (median PFS: AþCnP, 6.3 mo versus CnP, 5.6 mo; stratified HR ¼ 0.71; 95% CI: 0.60-0.85; p ¼ 0.0001), and an enhanced PFS benefit was observed with AþCnP versus CnP in the PD-L1-high subgroup (TC3 or IC3), despite not being formally tested for treatment comparison. Median OS in the ITT population was similar between the AþCnP (14.2 mo) and CnP (13.5 mo) arms (stratified HR ¼ 0.88, 95% CI: 0.73-1.05; p ¼ 0.1581). Of note, a higher unexpected, and further analyses are required to investigate whether an imbalance in patients' prognostic factors between arms in this subgroup could have contributed to this finding. Patients with high PD-L1 expression (TC3 or IC3) appeared to derive an OS benefit with the addition of atezolizumab (HR ¼ 0.48, 95% CI: 0.29-0.81). Although this was encouraging, any conclusions are limited, as the study was not powered for this subgroup analysis. The treatment effect in patients with high PD-L1 expression observed in IMpower131 is consistent with previous reports of atezolizumab single or combination therapy in both firstand second-line settings of NSCLC, as reported in POP-LAR, OAK, IMpower150, and the interim analysis of IMpower110. 6,7,9,14,18 The study KEYNOTE-407 investigated pembrolizumab in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel or chemotherapy alone in patients with stage IV squamous NSCLC who had not received previous systemic therapy for metastatic disease. 4 The addition of pembrolizumab to the chemotherapy regimen resulted in significant improvements in PFS and OS in the ITT population. As cancer immunotherapy is established as the standard of care in NSCLC, future prospective trials may address the question of whether programmed cell death protein 1 inhibition or PD-L1 inhibition results in favorable treatment outcomes, as cross-trial comparisons are inherently limited owing to the risk of systematic bias and confounding factors.</p>
        <p>The safety profile in IMpower131 was consistent with the known safety profile of each individual treatment, and no new safety signals were observed. Serious AEs, serious TRAEs, and AEs leading to withdrawal from any treatment were higher in the atezolizumabcontaining arms than in the chemotherapy-alone arm. The higher incidence of serious AEs observed in the AþCP and AþCnP arms than that observed in the CnP arm may be attributed to febrile neutropenia, anemia, and pneumonitis, a known risk with atezolizumab.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, IMpower131 suggests that addition of atezolizumab to CnP provides PFS and OS benefit in patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression.</p>
