        <p>Against a backdrop of global antibiotic resistance and increasing awareness of the importance of the human microbiota, there has been resurgent interest in the potential use of bacteriophages for therapeutic purposes, known as phage therapy. A number of phage therapy phase I and II clinical trials have concluded, and shown phages don't present significant adverse safety concerns. These clinical trials used simple phage suspensions without any formulation and phage stability was of secondary concern. Phages have a limited stability in solution, and undergo a significant drop in phage titre during processing and storage which is unacceptable if phages are to become regulated pharmaceuticals, where stable dosage and well defined pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are de rigueur. Animal studies have shown that the efficacy of phage therapy outcomes depend on the phage concentration (i.e. the dose) delivered at the site of infection, and their ability to target and kill bacteria, arresting bacterial growth and clearing the infection. In addition, in vitro and animal studies have shown the importance of using phage cocktails rather than single phage preparations to achieve better therapy outcomes. The in vivo reduction of phage concentration due to interactions with host antibodies or other clearance mechanisms may necessitate repeated dosing of phages, or sustained release approaches. Modelling of phage-bacterium population dynamics reinforces these points. Surprisingly little attention has been devoted to the effect of formulation on phage therapy outcomes, given the need for phage cocktails, where each phage within a cocktail may require significantly different formulation to retain a high enough infective dose. This review firstly looks at the clinical needs and challenges (informed through a review of key animal studies evaluating phage therapy) associated with treatment of acute and chronic infections and the drivers for phage encapsulation. An important driver for formulation and encapsulation is shelf life and storage of phage to ensure reproducible dosages. Other drivers include formulation of phage for encapsulation in micro-and nanoparticles for effective delivery, encapsulation in stimuli responsive systems for triggered controlled or sustained release at the targeted site of infection. Encapsulation of phage (e.g. in liposomes) may also be used to increase the circulation time of phage for treating systemic infections, for prophylactic treatment or to treat intracellular infections. We then proceed to document approaches used in the published literature on the formulation and stabilisation of phage for storage and encapsulation of bacteriophage in micro-and nanostructured materials using freeze drying (lyophilization), spray drying, in emulsions e.g. ointments, polymeric microparticles, nanoparticles and liposomes. As phage therapy moves forward towards Phase III clinical trials, the review concludes by looking at promising new approaches for micro-and nanoencapsulation of phages and how these may address gaps in the field.Against a backdrop of global antibiotic resistance and increasing awareness of the importance of the human microbiota, there has been resurgent interest in the potential use of bacteriophages for therapeutic purposes, known as phage therapy.

        <p>The discovery of antibiotics and the subsequent control of bacterial infections may be regarded as a significant achievement of modern medicine. Surgery, transplantation and chemotherapy rely heavily on the control of bacterial infections. Broad spectrum antibiotics are highly attractive since they may be used against a wide range of bacteria without the need to identify the infection causing bacterial agent. This advantage has also resulted in significant misuse and overuse of antibiotics contributing to the emergence of antibiotic resistance [1]. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics has become a significant problem in the treatment of a wide range of infections where the bacteria commonly causing the infections have become highly resistant to many classes of antibiotics including third generation cephalosporins, carbapenems and fluoroquinolones [2]. Recent evidence of plasmid mediated colistin resistance in Enterobacteriacea is particularly troubling [3]. Between 1940 and 1962 more than 20 new classes of antibiotics came to market; since then the antibiotic pipeline has produced only two new classes [4]. Coates et al. [4] estimate that to stem the rising tide of antibiotic resistance 20 new classes of antibiotics are urgently needed. It is highly unlikely that this goal will be achievable even if governments provided stronger economic incentives to industry to develop new broad spectrum antibiotics. Czaplewski et al. [5] call for a sustained, concerted and coordinated international effort and discuss the need to invest in the development of alternatives to antibiotics (non-compound approaches) including probiotics, vaccines as well bacteriophage and phage derived lysins.The discovery of antibiotics and the subsequent control of bacterial infections may be regarded as a significant achievement of modern medicine.

        <p>Bacteriophage (viruses that infect bacteria) are highly abundant in the environment and may be the source of low cost antimicrobials. The focus of recent phage therapy approaches is on the use of lytic tailed phage all of which belong to the Caudovirales and include the Myoviridae, Siphoviridae and Podoviridae families [6]. Members of the Caudovirales have an icosahedral capsid head that contains double-stranded DNA (15 -500 Kbp), and a tail with surface receptor proteins that interact with surface features on the host bacterium [7]. Successful phage therapy requires interaction between the phage and the bacterium resulting in adsorption of the phage to the host bacterium followed by injection of the phage DNA. The pharmacodynamics of this process has been modelled using mathematical models based on colloidal interactions [8][9][10]. Upon infection, the phage replication cycle ensues culminating (after a short latency period) in cell lysis and the liberation of multiple phage virions (with a burst size that is typically between 10 and 100, [11]). Gill and Hyman [12] and Weber-Dabrowska et al. [13] provide an overview of key considerations related to phage choice, isolation and purification for phage therapy. Phage therapy practice relies on the isolation of naturally occurring phage abundantly found in the environment [14]. Typically, phage are isolated from the environment and screened against commonly occurring pathogenic bacterial strains (to identify host ranges) and then evaluated using in vitro and in vivo animal models. The limitation of host ranges is overcome through the use of phage cocktails to ensure sufficient coverage of commonly occurring strains and the use of phage mixtures targeting different receptors reduces the probability of encountering phage resistant bacterial mutants. Phages are generally manufactured using standard fermentation process technology. In brief, host bacteria are grown in liquid culture in a bioreactor. During the log growth phase, phages are added to the bioreactor to infect the bacteria. Incubation of phage with bacteria results in phage adsorption to the bacteria, infection and following a short lag period, release of bacteriophage virions. The resulting lysate contains the product (the amplified phage) along with bacterial debris and residual fermentation media. Removal of cellular debris is typically done using centrifugation and/or filtration. Ion exchange, gel filtration etc. can be used to further purify the bacteriophage (e.g. for the removal of endotoxin for Gram negative bacteria). Typically phage may then be re-suspended in simple saline or buffer and stored under refrigerated conditions or processed further e.g. spray dried to improve storage shelf life or encapsulated in micro-or nanoparticle formulations.Bacteriophage (viruses that infect bacteria) are highly abundant in the environment and may be the source of low cost antimicrobials.

        <p>Most of the recent phage therapy studies (using small vertebrate animals) have investigated treatments focusing on acute infections (Table 1). In acute infections the specific infection causing bacterium may be identified using suitable rapid diagnostic methods (e.g. lateral flow assays, PCR, MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry). In such instances, narrow spectrum antimicrobials such as bacteriophages may provide a suitable therapeutic alternative where organisms are resistant to frontline antibiotics or to reduce the use of broad spectrum antibiotics as part of a global effort towards antibiotic stewardship. An example of this is in cases of urinary tract infections where a significant proportion of the cases are caused by a particular pathotype Escherichia coli with specific virulence factors [25]. Animal studies have shown that phage may be effective in certain instances e.g. in treating acute respiratory infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa [26][27][28] and in the treatment of systemic infections caused by S. aureus [29]. A significant focus of phage therapy studies in animals has been around respiratory infections, gastrointestinal infections and infections of the skin and wounds (Table 1). Phage therapy studies with animals has shown that in certain instances, it may help in reducing the densities of the infecting bacterial populations to levels that may allow the host immune response to mount a successful defence and clear the infection [26,27,30].Most of the recent phage therapy studies (using small vertebrate animals) have investigated treatments focusing on acute infections (Table 1).

        <p>A number of in vivo phage studies (with animals and humans) have suggested that phage therapy may be beneficial in the treatment of difficult to treat antibiotic resistant pulmonary infections (e.g. cystic fibrosis [26] and pneumonia [31,32]), topical and wound infections [33,34] and gastrointestinal infections [35].A number of in vivo phage studies (with animals and humans) have suggested that phage therapy may be beneficial in the treatment of difficult to treat antibiotic resistant pulmonary infections (e.g. cystic fibrosis [26] and pneumonia [31,32]), topical and wound infections [33,34] and gastrointestinal infections [35].</p>
        <p>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease of the lung resulting in reduced hydration and thickening of secretions covering the respiratory epithelium. Highly viscous mucus is not cleared by the epithelial cells and eventually leads to chronic inflammation and bacterial infections. Two common bacterial strains isolated from sputum are Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae, which are also one of the first to infect the lungs during childhood [36]. S. aureus can generally be controlled with antibiotics but infection usually predisposes chronic colonization. The main pathogen infecting the pulmonary epithelium is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which grows in biofilms within the CF lungs [37]. Several pulmonary pathogens are capable of forming biofilms in which the bacteria are encased in exopolysaccharide (EPS) and are less metabolically active [38]. The extracellular matrix in the biofilm impairs the action of antibiotics acting as a diffusional barrier. The low metabolic activity of the bacteria in the biofilm also limits the efficacy of many classes of antibiotics that target various metabolic pathways. Some bacteriophage may be able to degrade biofilms and infect bacteria residing within them [39,40]. Burkholderia cenocepacia are opportunistic pathogens in CF causing acute pulmonary disease and sepsis or chronic infection characterised by accelerated decline in lung function. Multidrug resistant phenotypes are exhibited by most strains. There is a need for alternative therapies to treat B. cenocepacia; several virulent phage for B. cenocepacia have been characterised. A number of in vivo phage therapy studies have looked at P. aeruginosa [26,27,41] and B. cenocepacia [42] infections in animal models.Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease of the lung resulting in reduced hydration and thickening of secretions covering the respiratory epithelium.

        <p>Ventilator-associated-pneumonia (VAP) occurs often in patients in an intensive care unit setting. A clear respiratory airway is a necessity for patient survival; after being intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, patients suffer from pneumonia caused by infection with P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae and Acinetobacter baumanii which take advantage of the weakened immune system of the patient. One of the major problems is antibiotic resistance. Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp., Serrati sp., and Burkholderia sp., have also been reported as infecting bacteria. Klebsiella pneumoniae is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen responsible for much community-acquired pneumonia and a significant proportion of hospital-acquired pneumonia [31]. It is a leading cause of pneumonia morbidity and mortality with resistance to carbapenems and other antibiotics [43]. A number of in vivo phage therapy studies have looked at B. cepacia [42] and K. pneumonia [31,32] infections in animal models.Ventilator-associated-pneumonia (VAP) occurs often in patients in an intensive care unit setting.

        <p>Multidrug resistant tuberculosis cases are a significant healthcare problem with extensively drug resistant M. tuberculosis practically untreatable in low-income countries [45]. Multi-drug resistant (MDR) Mtb strains are resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin, two of the frontline antibiotics used to treat TB. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimate there were nearly 500,000 new cases of MDR TB in 2015 [44]. Most alarming are the development of extensively drug resistant (XDR) strains, which are additionally resistant to second line antibiotics. Although antibiotic treatment rapidly reduces the infectiousness of patients, those with drug-resistant infections remain infectious during therapy until the drug resistance is identified and the treatment regimen is changed. Treatment for TB is protracted, requiring antibiotics to be taken for at least 6 months, rising to two years for MDR infections. The antibiotics can have undesirable side effects, and interruptions to therapy (intermittent supply or patient non-compliance) provide the opportunity for the development of drug resistance and treatment failure. There is therefore, an urgent need for new therapies to treat TB and also to shorten length of treatment. The Mtb bacillus is transmitted in aerosol droplets and therapies which reduce patient infectiousness or prevent the establishment of new infections will also have great impact on TB control. Infection is established in a new host when inhaled Mtb bacilli in the lower respiratory tract are engulfed by alveolar macrophage [46]. The bacilli resist usual macrophage killing mechanisms and replicate, until such time that the immune response triggers recruitment of systemic mononuclear cells which surround the focus of infection and form a granuloma. The centre of the granuloma becomes hypoxic, pH drops and conditions no longer support bacterial growth. Instead the Mtb bacilli remain in a dormant state with low metabolic activity, until such time that the immune system weakens, the granuloma breaks down and with this the bacilli reactivate and replicate once more. During this active TB disease the patient excretes large number of bacilli when they cough and can transmit the infection to new susceptible hosts.

        <p>Chronic wounds are a severe worldwide problem.

Studies suggest that wound management accounts for over half of community health nurse resources in European settings [50]. The majority of chronic wounds are colonised with bacteria that form biofilms, thereby compromising wound healing by making them more refractory to treatment and slow tissue repair by stimulating chronic inflammation at the wound site [51]. Antimicrobials including antibiotics and antiseptics are used clinically to decrease the bacterial load and promote wound healing [52].

        <p>There are a number of specific features regarding phage-bacterium dynamics that are worth highlighting in the context of phage therapy. Bacterial killing by phage is dependent on phage particles adsorbing to the target bacteria [9]. Phage-bacterium binding kinetics may be modelled as a simple first order process with respect to the concentrations of bacteria and phage populations respectively [8,63]. Payne and Jansen [63] developed a mathematical model focusing on the dynamics of phage infection of bacteria during the bacterial exponential growth phase.

[9] fitted in vitro phage-bacteria population dynamics (time series data for Camplylobacter jejuni) to extract interaction parameters; the model included the rate at which resistant cells arise by mutation from a susceptible population. Their model and that of Levin and Bull [8] helps explain the in vitro observations (see Tanji et al. [64]) showing increase in concentration of resistant bacteria in the presence of high concentrations of phage. In in vitro studies, the rate of growth of resistant bacteria tends to be similar to that of the original susceptible population. The fitted rate of mutation was found to be of the order of 10 -5 h -1There are a number of specific features regarding phage-bacterium dynamics that are worth highlighting in the context of phage therapy. Bacterial killing by phage is dependent on phage particles adsorbing to the target bacteria [9]. Phage-bacterium binding kinetics may be modelled as a simple first order process with respect to the concentrations of bacteria and phage populations respectively [8,63]. Payne and Jansen [63] developed a mathematical model focusing on the dynamics of phage infection of bacteria during the bacterial exponential growth phase.

Measures to suppress growth of resistant bacteria would include use of multiple phage strains incorporating phage that bind to different receptors. The purpose of the modelling is to illustrate a number of important features that provide insights that may help inform in vivo phage therapy.

        <p>Our simulations demonstrate the conditions under which phage therapy may be able to limit the proliferation of bacterial populations. High phage densities are needed in order to arrest the growth of phage susceptible bacteria (Figure 1 a, b). We have indicated an arbitrary upper bacterial concentration threshold of 10 9 CFU/ml as an aid to guide the reader's eye. Adsorption of phage to bacteria results in an initial drop in phage concentration (see experimental results by Cairns et. al. [9] with Campylobacter jejuni showing this). The timing of rapid in situ phage amplification is highly dependent on the concentration of the bacteria [9]. Successful amplification of phage is dependent on high bacterial concentration hence efficient killing is not achieved until both phage and bacteria concentration increase significantly (Figure 1 b). See also experimental results in support of this in the work by Tanji et al. [64]. Resistant bacteria quickly become the dominant population (Figure 1 a, b) unless a phage mixture (cocktail) is used containing high doses of the different phage strains capable of killing the resistant mutant population (Figure 1 c,d). It is known that phage clearance mechanisms rapidly reduce the phage concentration in the absence of host bacteria [58].Our simulations demonstrate the conditions under which phage therapy may be able to limit the proliferation of bacterial populations.

        <p>Using high initial bacterial concentration, a high phage dose is quickly able to arrest the rise of bacterial growth (Figure 2 a). Tanji et al. [64] show this for E. coli using an in vitro chemostat experimental system. However, if low starting concentrations of bacteria are present, phage concentrations decay significantly and phage are unable to amplify and achieve a sufficiently high concentration to eradicate the infecting bacteria until the bacteria have had time to grow bacterial numbers substantially (Figure 2 b). In such circumstances it takes time for the bacterial population to grow before phage are able to adequately multiply in situ and then arrest bacterial growth (experimental results by Cairns et al. [9] show this). During this delay in bacterial concentration growth, phage concentrations may decay significantly thereby resulting in poor phage therapy outcomes. If phage are administered prophylactically too early prior to infection or at the early onset of infection (when the bacteria concentration is low), clearance of phage by the host immune system or by other mechanisms (e.g. shortening of intestinal transit times during diarrhoea) may result in lowering of the in situ phage concentration resulting in poor phage therapy outcomes (Figure 2 b). Under such conditions encapsulation may be a good strategy (Figure 2 c). Encapsulation of phage and their slow controlled release may help in ensuring that the in situ phage concentration remains at a therapeutically effective level (over a realistic time period) allowing phage to amplify once the bacteria concentration increases to levels sufficient for in situ phage amplification (Figure 2 c).Using high initial bacterial concentration, a high phage dose is quickly able to arrest the rise of bacterial growth (Figure 2 a).

        <p>Our simulations show that the in vivo phage concentration at the site of infection is an important parameter governing the efficacy of phage therapy. Loss of phage activity during formulation and storage, or phage inactivation due to the in vivo environment (e.g. acidic pH of the stomach or enzymatic activity) may result in poor phage therapy outcomes. These issues have received little attention in phage therapy literature. Research is therefore needed in the area of phage formulation to ensure phage titre remains stable during storage (e.g. over a 24 month period). Phage cocktails necessitate careful consideration of formulation conditions as each type of phage making-up the cocktail may require individually tailored formulations to ensure phage viability and stability during storage.Our simulations show that the in vivo phage concentration at the site of infection is an important parameter governing the efficacy of phage therapy.

        <p>Frequent administration of high phage doses was found to result in better outcomes [64,76,78,80]. This is an important point considering in vivo phage-bacteria dynamics. Better phage therapy outcomes were noted when both phage and bacteria concentrations tend to be high. Phage titre reduction in vivo may result in poor phage therapy results when bacterial concentrations may be too low for rapid phage amplification. Reduction in phage titre may also explain results of a number of studies that evaluated prophylactic phage therapy with mixed results [70,73,75,79,80,83]. Use of phage cocktails rather than single phage was found to yield better results [58,64] and in some instances reduced the chances of finding phage resistant mutants. A number of studies did find phage resistant mutants [66,69]. The complex architecture of the intestinal tract was found to present a challenge for phage therapy.

        <p>Results of a number of animal studies suggest that stopping rapid amplification in bacterial numbers is an important factor in therapy outcomes [26][27][28]. Arresting infection by early administration of high phage dose when the bacteria are also highly susceptible to phage infection was found to correlate with better phage therapy outcomes. Administration of high concentrations of phage may result in multiple phage particles adsorbing per bacterial cell which may lead to bacterial cell lysis due to phage binding without phage virion production. Delbruck [84] coined the term lysis from without. Large numbers of phage adsorbing to the bacterial cell wall may lead to cell wall damage due to the enzymatic action of tailed phage enzymes acting on the cell membrane [85].Results of a number of animal studies suggest that stopping rapid amplification in bacterial numbers is an important factor in therapy outcomes [26][27][28].

        <p>Infection is generally induced in animal models with a single bacterial species, however, even single bacterial triggered infections necessitate the use of phage cocktails rather than single phage treatments. This is because phage mixtures targeting different receptors reduce the probability of encountering phage resistant bacterial mutants (see modelling section above). Denou et al. [86] suggest that cocktails containing between 10 and 16 phage may be needed to cover half to two thirds of E. coli strains (representing the five main pathogenic types isolated from patients suffering from diarrhoea) in order to cure E. coli related diarrhoea. Cocktails of phage may also provide synergistic effects such as access to bacteria in mucus and biofilms with a phage possessing biofilm/mucus degrading enzymes enhancing access within mucus/biofilms for other phage better suited to killing the bacteria [87]. This point has significant implications for phage formulation since different phage within a cocktail may need different formulation ingredients to aid shelf life during storage in order to retain infectivity. A number of animal studies (discussed below) have shown that regular repeated doses of high phage titres resulted in better outcomes rather than a single dose. Encapsulation of phage in controlled release systems may allow constant release (zero order release) of phage e.g. using readily available technologies such as osmotic pumps or constant reservoir systems used in the pharmaceutical industry. Vandenheuvel et al. [88] discuss the importance of phage stability and the unacceptability of phage titre drop in view of pharmaceutical regulations. The results of animal studies (above) provide strong evidence of the need to deliver high titres of phage at the site of infection. Phage dose-response studies in animals suggest that a drop in titre of 1-log during storage could result in phage therapy failure.

        <p>Bacteriophage have a narrow host range. They are specific not only in terms of killing a particular species, but often they only target a sub set of strains within the species. In an outbreak situation where the causative agent and strain information is available, selection of a relevant phage for therapy may not be a problem [26]. However, as phage host range is narrow, rapid diagnosis of the causative agent and the strain would benefit accurate phage selection. Most phage therapy studies in model animal systems (discussed above) have used simple phage solutions prepared immediately prior to use. Phage banks may need to regularly screen phage against common infection causing strains and manufacture these in batches to make them readily available. The phage would need to be processed in such a manner so as to ensure long shelf life (typically 12 months) e.g. formulated in excipients and spray dried or freeze dried to ensure accurate dosage at the time of therapy.Bacteriophage have a narrow host range.

Bacteria were injected subcutaneously whereas phage were injected intravenously. A high phage dose (10 8 PFU) was given (the animal was subcutaneously given a dose of 10 6 CFU of a highly virulent clinical isolate of the bacterium to create a skin lesion) and shown to reduce the bacterial burden of the lesion and in the bacterial CFU in the liver (14 h post infection). Experiments with delayed treatment (≥ 6 h) post infection showed lack of efficacy and resulted in failure. Dose response studies with animals infected with 10 3 CFU of bacteria and immediately given either 10 4 , 10 6 or 10 8 PFU of phage showed only the higher concentration of phage dose at 10 8 PFU afforded significant protection to the treated mice. The need for high phage dosages was attributed to the short doubling time of the bacterium (45 min) which resulted in a high growth rate of bacteria post infection. The study also evaluated the half-life of phage (2.2 h at 10 8 PFU) injected intravenously and found that phage concentrations in blood rapidly decreased due to clearance by the reticuloendothelial system.

A high phage dose (10 8 PFU) was given (the animal was subcutaneously given a dose of 10 6 CFU of a highly virulent clinical isolate of the bacterium to create a skin lesion) and shown to reduce the bacterial burden of the lesion and in the bacterial CFU in the liver (14 h post infection). Experiments with delayed treatment (≥ 6 h) post infection showed lack of efficacy and resulted in failure. Dose response studies with animals infected with 10 3 CFU of bacteria and immediately given either 10 4 , 10 6 or 10 8 PFU of phage showed only the higher concentration of phage dose at 10 8 PFU afforded significant protection to the treated mice. The need for high phage dosages was attributed to the short doubling time of the bacterium (45 min) which resulted in a high growth rate of bacteria post infection. The study also evaluated the half-life of phage (2.2 h at 10 8 PFU) injected intravenously and found that phage concentrations in blood rapidly decreased due to clearance by the reticuloendothelial system. Phage are known to induce antibodies aiding their removal from circulation as well as neutralising their interaction with bacteria [30,42,89].</p>

        <p>Nale et al. [55] used a hamster model for the oral delivery of either single or a mixture of phage against Clostridium difficile. A hamster model of acute C. difficile infection (CDI) was used. The model reflected some of the clinical features of CDI including toxin-mediated diarrhoea and tissue pathology. Animals were given sodium bicarbonate orogastrically to reduce stomach acidity. Animals were infected with ~10 3 CFU/hamster of spores and subsequently treated with ~10 8 PFU/hamster of either a single phage or a cocktail of phage. The first dose was given at the time of infection with further doses every 8 h until the scheduled end-point of 36 h (toxin production in untreated animals is limited up to this time point in the cecum and colon thereby allowing assessment of the effect of phage treatment on colonization in the absence of toxin related symptoms). At this time point, animals were culled and enumeration of total bacterial load (spores and vegetative cells) in the cecum and colon was undertaken. Phage treatment with certain combination of phage mixtures was shown to reduce bacterial load in the cecum and colon however, results were variable. This variability was attributed to the ratio of phage to bacteria present at various locations in the cecum and colon during the initial phase of bacterial outgrowth. In a separate experiment using the earlier protocol but continuing regular 8h phage treatments delayed onset of symptoms by 33 h (due to toxin production) in phage treated animals compared to untreated animals was observed.

Caecum samples collected from euthanized animals showed significantly higher numbers of chickens treated with encapsulated phage had phage in their caecum 48h and 72h later. Bacteriophage therapy against Salmonella was evaluated over 17 days in chickens orally administered either the free phage cocktail or encapsulated phage cocktail (bacterial dose at day 0: 10 7 CFU/chicken, phage dose 10 10 PFU/chicken). Oral doses of phage were administered daily for 9 days (from day -1 to day 7 after Salmonella infection). Over the course of daily phage therapy (days 1, 3, 6) both groups receiving phage treatment showed lower (~ 3 log reduction) Salmonella concentration in the cecum compared with the control group. Once daily phage treatment had stopped (day 8 onwards), Salmonella concentration in the free phage treated group returned to levels similar to the control group. However, the liposome encapsulated phage treated group continued to show lower Salmonella concentration in the cecum compared with the control group up to day 15.

Administration of phage using intramuscular injection was found to be the best means of ensuring phage dissemination in all tissues (including lungs). In the work by Oliveira et al. [92], aerosol spray administration (details regarding the spray generation were not given) allowed phage to be directly delivered to the lungs. Sufficient details regarding the formulation of phage for spray dose were not given, e.g. whether the spray droplet size distribution was suitable to aid droplet distribution in the lower respiratory tract. The phage type, administration route and dose delivered were all found to affect the distribution of phage in the animal tissues. Phage were rapidly cleared from the organs 10 h after administration.</p>
        <p>Huff et al. [90] determined the efficacy of aerosol administration (using an atomising nozzle and exposing the birds to the aerosol in a closed chamber resulting in uptake by inhalation) of a cocktail containing two bacteriophage (isolated against avian pathogenic E. coli) to prevent an E. coli respiratory tract infection in broiler chickens. A severe dose of 10 4 CFU/chicken (age 1 week) followed by a cocktail of phage (a mixture of two phage at 10 7 :10 8 PFU/chicken) resulted in reduction in observed mortality (at age 3 weeks) compared with untreated controls. The dose of phage was found to be important with lower concentrations of aerosolized phage affording worse protection. The timing of phage administration was also evaluated with phage treatment immediately following E. coli infection showing positive efficacy results. However, results were mixed when phage were administered prior to or 3 days following E. coli challenge. Bacteria were cultured from swabs of liver and air sacs but data on phage titres from the tissue samples were not given.Huff et al.

        <p>(100 times higher dose of phage with respect to the bacterial dose was given). 48 h after phage treatment, mice were euthanized and lung tissue samples were analysed for B. cenocepacia and phage. Mice treated with phage delivered via intraperitoneal injection had significantly lower lung bacterial counts compared with untreated control mice 48 h after treatment. The phage concentration in the lungs of mice was not statistically significant from mock infected mice with similar dose of intraperitoneal treated phage. The intranasal treatment did not result in a statistically significant reduction in lung bacterial counts however phage had amplified in the lungs and were present at concentrations above those in mock infected mice with similar dose of inhaled phage. 24 h after infection (but before phage treatment), bacteria were primarily found in lung parenchyma in peribronchiolar and perivascular areas, occasionally co-localized with alveolar macrophage. Relatively few bacteria were found in the airway lumen. 72 h after infection (without phage treatment), bacteria were found in microcolonies in lung parenchyma. The concentration of phage in lungs of mice treated intranasally was 2 log higher in comparison with intraperitoneal treated mice. Intranasally administered phage were found co-localised with alveolar macrophages 48 h after treatment. This suggested that phage delivered via pulmonary delivery were sequestered by lung macrophage and therefore may be unavailable to kill bacteria found in the lung parenchyma. Inhaled phage did replicate in bacteria as the titres were found to be higher compared with the control group. Phage may have been able to replicate in bacteria taken-up by the macrophage. The phage in the macrophage remained viable as determined by the high phage titres. In intraperitoneally treated mice, phage were found in vascular and perivascular areas and alveolar septa where phage were found co-localized with degraded bacteria. Results from the study indicated better access of phage delivered intraperitoneally via systemic circulation to bacteria than those delivered via pulmonary delivery. The site of greatest bacterial killing may have been within the lung parenchyma rather than the airway lumen. Phage delivered via the airway may not have been able to effectively penetrate the respiratory epithelium where bacteria may have translocated from the lumen to the lung interstitium. The lower concentration of phage in the lung following intraperitoneal delivery was attributed to a rapid decrease in bacterial density and clearance of phage thereafter in the absence of sufficient bacterial hosts.(100 times higher dose of phage with respect to the bacterial dose was given). 48 h after phage treatment, mice were euthanized and lung tissue samples were analysed for B. cenocepacia and phage.

        <p>Semler et al.

They also evaluated intraperitoneal delivery of B. cenocepacia phage which resulted in higher concentrations of phage delivered to the lung supporting the findings of Carmody et al. [42] that intraperitoneal delivery of phage allows phage to access the lung. There was however a discrepancy between the results of Semler et al. [91] and Carmody et al. [42] with regard reduction in mouse lung bacteria concentrations for phage delivered using the intraperitoneal route. This may be explained by low concentrations of bacteria present in the lung for experiments carried out by Semler et al. [91] which may have resulted in poor in situ phage amplification.Semler et al.

        <p>Debarbieux et al. [26] evaluated pulmonary phage therapy using a fluorescently labelled P. aeruginosa strain (to monitor in real time the spatial and temporal development of infection) in an acute mouse lung infection model. The infectious dose was 10 7 CFU/mouse. In preventive experiments, phage were given intranasally 24h before infection. Page lysates were simply purified using caesium chloride ultracentrifugation and then suspended in phosphate buffered saline. Untreated mice died within 48 h of infection. Mice treated with a phage to bacterium ratio of 1:10 died within 5 days after infection. Mice treated with a higher phage to bacterium ratio 1:1 (80-100%) and 10:1 (100%) survived until the end of the experiment (12 days post infection). Subsequent experiments were carried out using the higher phage dose i.e. phage to bacterium ratio of 10:1. Phage were administered 2 h post infection. Within 6h post infection differences were observed in the amount of luminescent bacteria in the lungs of the infected mice suggested rapid killing by the phage. After 24h untreated mice were either dead or showed high levels of luminescence whereas phage treated mice showed no or weak spots of light with tissue cultures showing bacterial load of 10 8 CFU/ml in untreated mice versus 10 2 CFU/ml in phage treated mice at 24h post infection.

        <p>Measurement of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha indicated attenuation of the host inflammatory response due to phage treatment. Delaying phage treatment by 2h, 4h and 6h post infection resulted in all mice surviving after 24h (treated with phage 2h post infection) but only 75% of mice surviving following phage treatment 4h and 6h post infection. At 72h post infection survival was as follows 100% (2h delay), 75% (4h delay) and 25% (6h delay). Phages were seen to remain effective in mice 24h following treatment. Infection of mice 24h post phage treatment (intranasal administration of 10 8 phage /mouse: 10 7 CFU/mouse) resulted in 100% of mice surviving 16 days post infection whereas all untreated mice had died. Non-invasive bioluminescence data suggested that rapid bacterial replication kinetics was an important factor in arresting infection by early administration of phage when the bacteria are also highly susceptible to phage infection. High dose of phages administered early during the onset of infection rapidly reduced bacterial numbers and the associated inflammatory response in the host. The use of bacteriophage as a therapeutic strategy to fight K. pneumoniae infection has previously been tested; a murine model of infection could be cleared [32]. However, in this study (as in other animal studies reviewed above), clearance of infection only occurred when bacteriophage were administered immediately after K. pneumoniae infection which limits the potential of phage therapy for clinical use.Measurement of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha indicated attenuation of the host inflammatory response due to phage treatment.

        <p>Singla et al. [31] used liposome encapsulation of the lytic K. pneumoniae bacteriophage (belonging to the Podoviridae family). They investigated treatment efficacy of liposome-encapsulated phage compared with free phage, to treat established K. pneumoniae infection in a murine pneumonia model. Delay in phage treatment administered via intraperitoneal injection (6h, 24h and 48h) post intranasal administration of K. pneumonia was investigated. Free phage administration 6h post administration of K. pneumonia was shown to result in complete elimination of K. pneumonia from lung samples (this was not the case for the 24h (~ 2 log reduction in CFU noted) and 48h (CFU levels similar to untreated positive controls) treated animals) delay is phage treatments. Phage were observed in the vascular and perivascular areas and along alveolar septa; similar results were reported by other researchers [42]. Phages were observed in lungs for longer (up to ~ 3 -4 days) for animals infected with K. pneumonia compared with negative controls. Phage amplification was noted in infected animals treated with free phage. Animals treated with liposome encapsulated phage 6h (infection cleared in 24h post treatment), 24h (infection cleared in 24h post treatment), 48h (reduction in CFU) and 72h (reduction in CFU) after K. pneumonia infection showed variable levels of efficacy of treatment. Earlier treatment was better than delaying treatment 48h or 72h. In the K. pneumonia mouse infection model, bacteria concentrations in control animals (untreated) was seen to peak at day 3 and fell significantly by day 5. Phage amplification in lung samples was noted for phage encapsulated liposome treated animals. Liposome entrapped phage persisted in lungs for 5 days post treatment. Prophylactic phage treatment (3h, 6h and 24h prior to intranasal K. pneumonia infection) was studied [31]. No significant therapeutic effect was observed for mice treated with free phage 24h prior to infection. The 3h and 6h treatment resulted in absence of infection. For phage encapsulated in liposomes no infection developed when mice were treated 6h, 24h and 48h prior to administration of infection suggesting encapsulation had a beneficial prophylactic therapeutic effect due to retention of the phage at therapeutic concentrations in the lung.Singla et al.

        <p>Although the majority of K. pneumoniae bacilli during infection are thought to be extracellular, it is recognised that K. pneumoniae can survive within macrophage and epithelial cells [93,94]. Liposome encapsulation may enhance access of phage to intracellular K. pneumonia. Using an ex vivo model of cultured murine peritoneal macrophage infected with K. pneumonia, Singla et al. [95] showed that cationic liposome encapsulated phage were able to kill greater numbers (~ 95%) of intracellular K. pneumonia compared with free phage (~ 20%). A potential limitation of phage therapy for treatment of infection is the development of phage -neutralizing antibodies which may result in reduction of the concentration of phage at the site of infection or in systemic circulation [30]. Singla et al. [95] demonstrated using ex vivo experiments that liposome encapsulation was effective at completely protecting K. pneumonia phage from the neutralizing effect of murine antibodies. Free phage were inactivated by serum antibodies raised against the phage in mice. Liposome encapsulated phage were able to inactivate K. pneumonia following 3h exposure to mouse serum containing antibodies.Although the majority of K. pneumoniae bacilli during infection are thought to be extracellular, it is recognised that K. pneumoniae can survive within macrophage and epithelial cells [93,94].

Phage applied to 24 h old biofilms (bacteria concentration ~10 7 CFU/well; phage dose ~10 8 PFU/well) were able to increase phage numbers by replicating in situ whilst killing the resident Pseudomonas (2log reduction in observed bioluminescence and 3-to 4-log reduction in cell concentration after 24h incubation of phage with cells). It took longer to clear Pseudomonas grown in biofilms in comparison with planktonic cells in the lung model. Singla et al.

Both free phage and liposome encapsulated phage showed similar levels of antimicrobial activity (~ 2 log reduction in CFUs) in the 4 day old biofilm model compared with the antibiotic amikacin.

        <p>Cocktails of phage covering multiple species and having the correct host range for different strains may be needed to facilitate clearance of chronic infections. Examples of such chronic infections include infections in cystic fibrosis (P. aeruginosa) and tuberculosis (M. Tuberculosis). Having suitably diagnosed the polymicrobial constitution of the infection causing bacteria, tailored phage formulations would need to be prepared and administered. Phage banks with well characterised phage lines with long shelf life would be needed in order to prepare such formulated phage cocktails and supplied for clinical use. The challenge here is delivery of precise concentrations of formulated phage cocktails at the site of infection e.g. for cystic fibrosis, which may require the phage to penetrate biofilms to gain access to the bacteria. Furthermore the phage would need to be phagocytosed into macrophage to target M. tuberculosis cells present in granulomas which poses an additional challenge.Cocktails of phage covering multiple species and having the correct host range for different strains may be needed to facilitate clearance of chronic infections.

Typically these tend to be case studies [96] however, recently two small randomised controlled trials have been undertaken [35,97]. The formulations used for these trials tend to be simple phage lysates that have been purified using crude laboratory methods including centrifugation, microfiltration, ultracentrifugation and in some instances endotoxin removal through affinity chromatography [98]. Phage cocktails used for the trials were simple suspensions in buffer without microencapsulation. The titre of phage s used was typically low and reliant on in situ amplification which may have resulted in therapy failure in at least one of the studies [35].There are relatively few recent published randomised control trial studies on the therapeutic use of phage involving humans.

Each 0.2 mL dose contained 10 5 PFU/ml each of six bacteriophages suspended in 10% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline and was applied to the infected ear using a standard 1 mL syringe equipped with a 27 gauge spinal needle. Patients re-visited the clinic on days 7, 21 and 42 days following treatment. Patient inclusion criteria included checking that the P. aeruginosa strain causing infection were susceptible to at least one phage in the therapeutic cocktail. Bacteriophage amplification (~ 2 log) was noted for bacteriophages in human subjects under trial conditions [97]. There were no reported side effects and no evidence of local or systemic toxicity due to phage therapy. Phage therapy was shown to result in a modest reduction (from the baseline) in median P. aeruginosa counts. Results were not overwhelmingly conclusive. In cases where infection was treated phage counts decreased to below the limit of detection.

        <p>A recent randomized phage therapy trial to reduce E. coli associated diarrhoea in children (6-24 month old males) failed to improve diarrhoea outcomes. This was attributed to low intestinal E coli concentration resulting in lack of significant phage amplification in vivo [35]. Half of the patients contained phage susceptible E coli in stool samples however, the stool CFU titres were low (median titre 10 5 CFU/g stool). Phage-bacteria pharmacodynamics dictates that conditions where there is a low in situ bacterium concentration are not conducive to significant phage amplification. Phage cocktails used in the study were given without antacid and were not protected from the stomach acidity by encapsulation hence phage titres reaching the site of infection may have been low. Rapid elimination of the phage from the host may also have further lowered the efficacy of the treatment.A recent randomized phage therapy trial to reduce E. coli associated diarrhoea in children (6-24 month old males) failed to improve diarrhoea outcomes.

Treatment involved standard wound care, including weekly soft tissue debridement if necessary [96]. Phage preparation was applied topically by dripping the phage solution into the wound cavity; gauze soaked with phage solution (0.1 -0.5 ml depending on ulcer volume) was packed into the cavity and the wound was wrapped with dry gauze.

No efficacy data was reported in the paper. However, a recent paper [99] presented results from the application of BFC-1 cocktail on colonized burn wounds in a small clinical trial (nine acute burn wound patients, 10 applications). Punch biopsies were taken to determine bacterial species identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests. 1 ml of BFC-1 solution was applied per 50 cm2 of burn wound area. The other half received standard treatment protocols. Patients also received systemic antibiotic treatment. Following BFC-1 treatment, the wound was covered with dressings, gauze and bandages according to standard treatment protocols. 2-5 h later, the burn wound was uncovered and two biopsies taken next to (within 2 cm) of the previous ones. Bacterial load determination of the biopsies was undertaken. Despite initial indications of wound colonisation or infection, bacterial cultures taken before and after treatment showed low levels of bacteria (in 8/10 applications). In all cases bacterial load remained unchanged after BFC-1 applications as well as after standard treatment. The low bacterial load in the wound was attributed to topical and systemic antibiotic treatment of patients prior to enrolment of the patient in the study (which took 7 days from initial assessment of colonisation/infection with target pathogen). Rose et al. [99] found that the sprayed BFC-1 solution had a tendency to run off the burn wound.

        <p>For phage therapy to work, bacteriophage concentrations at the site of infection must be sufficiently high for significant in situ phage amplification to occur and as a result reduce the rate of replication of the infecting population of bacterium. The phages need to be delivered at the site of infection and they need to have access to replicating bacteria susceptible to phage infection. Even when susceptible bacterial concentrations are high at the site of infection, delivery of low concentrations of phage may not be sufficient to increase phage concentration rapidly enough to achieve rapid killing of bacteria. Self-amplification will not occur when concentrations of bacteria are low (Levin and Bull, 2004). In vivo reduction in phage concentration due to the host immune response or other mechanisms also needs consideration. Under these conditions, steady or frequent delivery of high concentrations of phage may be needed for successful phage therapy. Phage resistant populations are highly likely and require use of a number of phage strains that bind to different receptors thereby killing the mutant bacteria. Use of different phage strains for therapeutic use requires careful formulation of phages to retain phage stability such that viable phages at a sufficiently high concentration are present at the time of use. Rational design of micro-and nanocapsules loaded with precise dose of encapsulated phage in stimuli responsive controlled release systems could be engineered to do this.For phage therapy to work, bacteriophage concentrations at the site of infection must be sufficiently high for significant in situ phage amplification to occur and as a result reduce the rate of replication of the infecting population of bacterium.

        <p>Developing formulations that incorporate bacteriophage for therapeutic applications requires an appreciation of the chemical and physical stresses phage may encounter both during processing as well as during storage once formulated. Phage inactivation and long term reduction in phage titre upon storage is highly undesirable. The physical and chemical properties of the formulation need careful consideration when selecting a technique for encapsulation. Accurate loading of phage per particle requires particle monodispersity which is rarely achieved in practice however, some techniques are considerably better than others (discussed below). The particle morphology should be without deformities and the particles shouldn't aggregate or uncontrollably fuse together with material in the surrounding environment. A polymer or lipid may be used to coat an existing structure containing the phage, for example Murthy and Engelhardt [82] sprayed phage on dried skimmed milk and then encapsulated them in a lipid coating. Alternatively, phage may be incorporated in the formulation within the droplet which upon drying or crosslinking results in phage entrapment in the particle core. Depending on the technique used, polymer gelling may be part of the technique or it may be a process occurring downstream. There are many techniques and processes that may be used for stabilising, immobilising and encapsulating phage. The most common methods are spraydrying, spray freeze drying, freeze drying, extrusion dripping methods, emulsion and polymerisation techniques.

This typically results in an increase in viscosity as well as osmolarity of the concentrated solution which inhibits further crystallization and eventually results in a frozen amorphous/crystalline phase. Preventing aggregation of bacteriophage and inactivation due to high osmotic pressure changes needs careful consideration here. At the end of the freezing stage, drying begins as a result of switching on a very low temperature condenser which draws water from the sample over time. A vacuum is also pulled to remove air which slows mass transfer to the condenser. A primary drying stage results in direct sublimation of the ice crystals, and remaining adsorbed water is removed in a secondary drying phase. In the freeze-dried state, the rate constants of most chemical and physical degradation reactions are dramatically reduced thereby permitting long term storage under refrigerated or ambient temperatures (25 • C). Traditional freeze drying is a slow process since the lyophilization is carried out at temperatures below the glass transition temperature of the maximally freeze-concentrated bacteriophage -excipient solution (Tg') and below the collapse temperature (Tc) of the sample thereby yielding a porous material with microstructure that is conducive for drying.

Papers on phage and virus freeze drying have mainly focused on evaluation of formulations in order to stabilize phage for storage [105,109,[113][114][115]. A number of papers have shown that addition of amino acids (e.g. sodium glutamate [113]), peptides (e.g. peptone [108]) and proteins (casein and lactoferrin [116]) to the formulation improves phage viability upon freeze drying and following rehydration (Table 2). Literature suggests that disaccharides e.g. lactose [116], sucrose [105,114,115,117] and trehalose [77,104,105,114,118] improve phage survival during freezing as well as subsequent lyophilization.A brief summary of the main issues surrounding the freeze drying of phage is now given.

Gelatine was found to play no role in maintaining phage viability following lyophilization.

Addition of sucrose at low concentrations (0.1M) in SM buffer was found to result in a high phage titre post freeze drying (only a ~0.5 log drop in titre attributed to the drying step rather than freezing step) with the titre remaining stable for up to 120 days upon storage. Increasing the sucrose concentration in SM buffer to 0.3M or 0.5M resulted in a ~0.5 log lower titre compared with the 0.1M sucrose sample.

Subsequent lyophilization resulted in highly porous dry powder (mean geometric particle diameter ~30µm corresponding to the droplet size generated by the ultrasonic nozzle). Particles with high trehalose content (60%) were found to be highly hygroscopic and collapsed during storage whilst particles with lower trehalose content (40%) retained their porous structure (examined using SEM).

        <p>Spray drying processes atomise a liquid containing dissolved solids, converting it into a fine mist which is contacted with a hot dry gas (typically hot dry air) inside a drying chamber. Due to the high surface area to volume ratio of the very small atomised droplets, the solvent rapidly evaporates with each droplet forming a particle comprising the non-volatile components (bacteriophage and excipients) along with a small amount of residual moisture. The particles are separated from the airstream exiting the dryer, and cyclones or bag filters are typically used for this. Spray drying is a scalable industrial process technology and is widely used to produce fine powders for pharmaceutical applications including pulmonary delivery via dry powder inhalers (DPI) [124].

        <p>Phages have been shown not to be able to withstand high shear stress for too long. The nebulisation process has been shown to result in loss of phage titre [104,128]. Phages are also sensitive to thermal stresses and have been shown to partially lose activity at temperatures higher than 60˚C [108,129]. Low spray drying temperatures (~40 ˚C outlet air temperature) have been shown to result in higher phage titre [120] with high loss of phage titre observed at higher temperatures [104,128,130,131]. Literature on spray drying of phage suspensions typically includes excipients in the formulation to protect the phage from desiccation and thermal stress (Table 2). Upon spray drying, sugar excipients form amorphous structures with high glass transition temperatures (Tg), e.g. in their anhydrous amorphous form Tg of trehalose is 115 ˚C and Tg for lactose is 108 ˚C. Below the glass transition temperature, vitrification due to the excipient stabilises the encapsulated bioactive agent and permits storage over long periods at ambient or lower temperatures. Adsorption of moisture results in lowering of the Tg and compounds that are hygroscopic e.g. lactose require handling under controlled atmospheric conditions (low relative humidity) [131]. Refrigerated storage of spray dried powders at relative humidity exceeding 20% has been shown to result in loss of phage titre [120,132] whereas samples stored at low humidity were stable. Trehalose is the most frequently reported excipient used in the spray drying of phage and it has been shown to result in spray dried powders with high phage titre and good storage stability [104,120,131,132]. Trehalose has low toxicity and has been shown to protect biological material including proteins, probiotics and vaccines, against desiccation and thermal stress. Crowe et al. [133] suggested that the efficacy of trehalose as an excipient in drying is partly due to its high glass transition temperature at all water contents but also because trehalose binds residual water left over from the drying process to form a dihydrate which might otherwise participate in lowering the glass transition temperature to below ambient [132]. Other excipients that have been used to improve the dispersibility of spray dried phage containing powders include dextrans [128], lactose (common excipient used for DPI powders; [112,128]), glucose, sucrose, mannitol [104] and, leucine [104,131] (Table 2). Reducing sugars such as lactose may be unsuitable excipients for bacteriophage [128]. Alternatives such as mannitol have been suggested in the literature [134]. Phage spray drying studies using mannitol have reported improved particle dispersion characteristics however, phage viability results have been mixed [104,120]. Addition of proteins e.g. casein in combination with trehalose have shown good results [131]. Refrigerated storage of spray dried powders was reported to yield higher titres of phage during long term storage compared with storage under ambient conditions [120]. Different phage strains formulated and spray dried under identical conditions showed significant differences in the resulting phage titre suggesting the need for individually formulating each phage to be used in a phage cocktail [128,132].

        <p>Powder X-ray diffraction analysis (phage free powders dried under identical conditions to the phage containing powders) showed that spray dried trehalose powder was non-crystalline. Differential scanning calorimetry data showed that the spray dried trehalose had a Tg between 116˚C and 117˚C i.e. the trehalose was in an amorphous state suitable for phage vitrification. After 8 months of storage at 54% RH, the presence of an endothermic peak between 86 and 91˚C on DSC scans indicated the presence of stable trehalose dihydrate crystals. Spray dried trehalose powder samples stored at 0% RH did not show changes in DSC endotherms or XRD spectra. Trehalose is known to protect bioactive agents from thermal and dehydration stresses through structural and conformational stabilization of proteins by direct hydrogen bonding and the process of vitrification.

        <p>Leung et al. [104] spray dried a P. aeruginosa phage (podoviridae) designated PEV2 focusing on making phage containing powder for pulmonary delivery. The lytic podovirus (supplied by AmpliPhi Biosciences, Australia) was used at a titre of 10 7 PFU/ml suspended in dilute (2 wt% solids) aqueous mixtures of trehalose, mannitol and leucine (respective ratios either 60:20:20 or 40:40:20). The formulations were designed for use in dry powder inhalers (DPI), as leucine helps improve the dispersibility of the powders by reducing cohesive interactions between particles. Mixing phage with excipients in solution resulted in a ~0.5 log titre reduction, which was attributed to changes in ionic strength when the phage buffer was diluted in excipient solution. Leung et al. [104] used a two fluid nozzle for liquid atomisation which itself resulted in a ~ 1 log loss in phage viability. The air inlet temperature was 60˚C which resulted in low outlet temperatures of 40-45˚C. The low outlet temperature was chosen to minimize thermal stress for the phage. However, titres were lower (due to the drying process) than recorded for spray freeze drying process reported using the same phage and excipients in the same paper. Spray dried powders were collected inside a relative humidity controlled chamber (RH &lt; 20%) and stored at 4˚C. Spray drying resulted in a further ~1.5 log drop in phage titre. Leung et al.

Similar to Leung et al. [120], leucine was added to improve the dispersibility of the powder. Surfactants were added to some formulations to aid in the dispersion of the bacteriophage in the feed solution [136]. A vibrating mesh atomizer was used resulting in atomized droplet diameters around 7µm. Mild spray drying conditions were used to provide a low outlet temperature of between 40˚C -45˚C (air inlet temperature of 75˚C) and an outlet relative humidity of less than 7% RH. The spray dryer was housed in a controlled humidity chamber with glove ports to allow collection of and storage of powder without exposure to moisture. In vitro evaluation of the deposition of the phage loaded spray dried powders was carried out using an experimental idealised throat and lung system (Alberta Idealized Throat attached to an Anderson cascade impactor) using a commercially available DPI.

        <p>Phage drying and encapsulation can be performed using spray drying, freeze drying and spray freeze drying techniques. Freeze drying appears to be more successful that spray drying at maintaining high titre values, although the ability of spray drying (or spray freeze drying) provides very small particles thereby allowing them to be used in DPI for pulmonary delivery, without the need for further milling. The best conditions for the spray drying of phage have tended to be with low outlet air temperatures (40-60 ˚C) which are much lower than typically used in the spray drying of biological materials (70-100 ˚C). Some of the viability loss in spray drying may be due to the atomisation process. Survival rates during subsequent storage additionally depend on temperature and humidity during storage and are important considerations for the long term storage of phage. A review of published work on drying of phage clearly indicates that phage survival varies from phage to phage and is highly dependent on drying conditions and formulation parameters, which need to be optimised for each phage (although formulations involving disaccharides tend to be most successful). This presents a considerable challenge for phage therapy since cocktails of phage are typically needed. These need to be formulated for storage and the active titre of individual phage may be highly variable if all phage are formulated together.Phage drying and encapsulation can be performed using spray drying, freeze drying and spray freeze drying techniques.

        <p>A number of phage encapsulation studies using synthetic and natural polymers have utilised the emulsification route followed by solvent removal (Table 3). The dispersed phase usually comprises of the core material and solvent carrying the active agent (bacteriophage) and the polymer and a second phase which allows for the breakup of the inner phase into droplets. The emulsion may be water-in-oil (W/O) more typical for phage encapsulation [100], but could also be oil-in-water (O/W) [142] and in some cases a third phase may also be present. Once the droplets have formed, the solvent carrying the core material may be removed, which leaves behind solid particles containing the active agent in the core. Different mechanical emulsification techniques may be used to break-up the inner phase into droplets, such as high-pressure homogenisation, rotor-stator homogenisation, and ultrasonication. When two immiscible liquids are put together, shearing force breaks up the inner phase into small droplets. The droplet size uniformity however, is low as the shear applied does not remain uniform throughout the container resulting in droplet heterogeneity with some droplets being larger and some smaller. More advanced methods to produce uniform droplets based on microfluidic and membrane based techniques have thus far not been used for phage encapsulation (these methods are discussed at the end of the paper).A number of phage encapsulation studies using synthetic and natural polymers have utilised the emulsification route followed by solvent removal (Table 3).

        <p>Alternatively, phage containing polymer droplets have been produced via the extrusion technique [143]. The droplet may form in the air or into another liquid. The dispersed phase containing the polymer and phage is extruded through a needle with a specific nozzle diameter determining the size of the droplet [144]. Atomization nozzles have also been used to generate smaller droplets [78]. If the polymer requires a gelling or crosslinking agent then the droplet may be collected in a bath of the gelling agent [143,145,146]. Examples of this method are presented by the work of Ma et al.

        <p>The drivers for encapsulation are the need to protect phage from the harsh stomach environment rendering free phage inactive or at any rate resulting in reduction in phage titre. High doses of bacteriophage need to be delivered in a controlled manner at the site of infection in order to effectively reduce the concentration of infectious bacteria present there. This poses a considerable formulation and delivery challenge. Animal studies focusing on gastrointestinal infections (discussed above) have shown poor efficacy outcomes due to the challenges associated with in vivo phage therapy. Oral administration of bacteriophage for human or animal use requires careful consideration of a number of factors including: the acidic pH of the stomach, digestive enzymes (pepsin, proteases, lipases, amylase and trypsinogen), bile salts, pancreatic juices, residence time in different intestinal compartments (duodenum, jejunum, ileum) and phage permeability into the mucosal lining where the infection may reside. Without proper formulation, phage may easily be inactivated due to exposure to adverse environmental conditions. Carriers designed to protect the active agents e.g. from the harsh gastrointestinal environment may also be used to trigger their release. An important example of this is pH dependent release of encapsulated phage [75], exploiting the variation in pH throughout the GI tract; carriers may be designed to respond to specific pH which differs from the stomach (pH 1-3) to the small intestine (pH 5.5-6.5) and the colon (pH 6.5-7.2) [141].

        <p>Previous studies indicate that in humans gastric emptying of small microcapsules (less than 2mm) is rapid (~ 0.5-1.5 h) and is not greatly affected by the digestive state of the individual [163]. Gastric emptying times and environmental conditions in other animals may be quite different to those in humans e.g. gastric emptying times in pigs is longer (~1.4-2.2 h) [164]. A suitable biocompatible carrier encapsulating the phage may be required to protect and circumvent natural processes of the biological system e.g. the acidity of the stomach environment [75]. Triggered release of the phage at the site of infection needs to be engineered into the delivery system. For example, the gastrointestinal tract may be modelled as a distinct set of compartments (duodenum, jejunum, ileum etc.) with each compartment having different environmental conditions (with different pH and transit times) [165].Previous studies indicate that in humans gastric emptying of small microcapsules (less than 2mm) is rapid (~ 0.5-1.5 h) and is not greatly affected by the digestive state of the individual [163].

For example, the gastrointestinal tract may be modelled as a distinct set of compartments (duodenum, jejunum, ileum etc.) with each compartment having different environmental conditions (with different pH and transit times) [165].</p>
        <p>Release of phage in the infected colon may be the desired outcome. High capsule erosion rates triggered by a high pH early in the gastrointestinal tract may result in phage release too early with poor phage therapy outcomes. The harsh environment of the digestive system renders many sensitive therapeutic agents e.g. proteins and phage inactive when administered without due consideration to proper formulation [122,[166][167][168]. Owing to the nature of the infection, fluctuations in physiological conditions may also need to be considered and may indeed be put to use to trigger release at the site of infection [141]. Consideration of particular infection specific symptoms that might influence the delivery of the phage needs to be taken into account. For example, the onset of diarrhoea in humans causes the osmotic gradient between the epithelia and colon to decrease resulting in increased fluid leakage and shorter transit times [169]. Changes in pH have been observed in the intestine during infection which can directly affect the microbial population as well as transit times in the GI-tract [170].Release of phage in the infected colon may be the desired outcome.

        <p>Pathogens that cause systemic diseases may spread by the faecal/oral route and may cross the intestinal epithelial barrier by translocation. The small intestine and the ileum are scattered with lymphoid tissue that forms the Peyer's patch (PP) nodules. The PP nodules are overlaid by the follicle-associated epithelium (FEM) displaying Microfold cells (M cells). A large number of pathogens infecting the human body take advantage of this route to gain access to the host tissues. Salmonella typhimurium [171], E. coli [172] and many other pathogens have been shown to adhere preferentially to M cells. Targeting the M cells in the PPs may offer the opportunity to deliver phage accurately at the site of infection. Using anti-M-cell monoclonal antibodies as specific ligands, adsorption of phage containing micro-or nanoparticles (e.g. liposomes) into PPs may be used to target the M-cell membrane [173].Pathogens that cause systemic diseases may spread by the faecal/oral route and may cross the intestinal epithelial barrier by translocation.

        <p>Enhancing phage residence time inside the intestine may exploit the mucoadhesive property of certain molecules e.g. alginates [78,175,176]. This approach has not met with universal acceptance since the superficial mucus layer in the intestine is cleared at a rate between (50-270) min, potentially removing anything bound to it. Nanocarriers coated with polyPEG, hyaluronic acid or decorated with vitamin B12 have been shown to have a greater ability to diffuse through the mucus layer [177] thereby avoiding mucoadhesion.Enhancing phage residence time inside the intestine may exploit the mucoadhesive property of certain molecules e.g. alginates [78,175,176].

        <p>There is scope for the development of innovative strategies to deliver phage encapsulated in microand nanoparticles for different target clinical applications. Chemically modified biopolymers provide many opportunities for phage encapsulation including aliphatic polyesters, polyamides, polycarbonate and poly(amino acids). Synthetic polymers, like Eudragit® are a family of pH responsive polymethacrylate polymers; Eudragit® L100 dissolves at pH 6 and Eudragit® S100 at pH 7. These polymers are commercially available (Evonik, Darmstadt, Rohm Pharma Germany) and are widely used in the preparation of microspheres or for their coating.

        <p>Polymer based controlled release systems have been engineered for the delivery of therapeutic agents for enteric applications including treatment of ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease [184], colorectal cancer and food poisoning as well as many others [185]. The concentration of bacterial species in the upper GI tract is approximately 10 3 -10 4 CFU/ml, largely composed of gram positive facultative anaerobic bacteria. In the colon however, this increases significantly to 10 11 -10 12 CFU/ml [186] and is largely composed of anaerobes such as Bacteriodes, Bifidobacteria, Eubacteria, Clostridia, Enterococci and Enterobacteria. To survive in this environment bacteria utilise undigested substrates present in the small intestine. Carbohydrates like di-and tri-saccharides and polysaccharides are fermented by these organisms [187]. . Encapsulation using natural polysaccharides is attractive due to their biodegradability by human enzymes. Microbes produce enzymes such as β-glucoronidase, α-arabinosidase, β-xylosidase, β-galactosidase, nitroreductase or urea dehydroxylase [188]. These enzymes metabolise polysaccharides which the body is unable to process. Naturally occurring polysaccharides are popular because they are low-cost and readily available offering a wide variety of structures and properties [189,190]. Other polysaccharides used for drug delivery applications include; cellulose derived biopolymers e.g. hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, pectin derived biopolymers e.g. polygalacturonic acid, guar gum, carrageenans, carob bean gum (galactomannans) and dextrin. Amylose, a derivative of starch has been used to develop commercially available drug delivery systems, COLAL® and COLAL-PRED® for colonic diseases.

        <p>Alginate and chitosan have been used in a number of studies to encapsulate bacteriophage (Table 3). Sodium alginate is an anionic linear polysaccharide composed of alternating blocks of β-(14)-linked D-mannuronic acid (M) and α-(14)-linked L-guluronic (G) residues. The encapsulation of phage in alginates is achieved using mild processing conditions; alginate gelation is achieved by crosslinking of carboxylate anions of guluronic acid and calcium ions. Chitosan is a cationic hydrophilic polysaccharide obtained by partial deacetylation of chitin; it has been studied for its muco-penetrative and tight-junction penetration properties [193,194]. Penetration of the mucosal anionic surface by chitosan is determined by the amino groups [195]. Lameiro et al. [196] showed encapsulation of an adenoviral vector; for mucosal delivery of vaccines; encapsulation efficiency over 84% was achieved with a chitosan coating. Premature release in aqueous media as a consequence of the swelling characteristic of chitosan was observed. Takeuchi et al. [197] showed that chitosan coated submicron liposomes interacted with the gut mucosa and had longer residence times in the GI tract. Pectin has been used for the encapsulation of phage [122]. Pectin is a polysaccharide of partial methyl ester of α-D-galaturonic acid (poly-Gal) interrupted with (12)-α-L-rhamnose units. Pectin forms rigid gels through crosslinking of galacturonic acid with multivalent cations.

        <p>Protection from stomach acid, pepsin and bile salts Alginate and chitosan have been widely used to encapsulate a variety of bacteriophage for oral delivery applications (Table 3). The porosity of alginate gel micro-beads affects phage susceptibility to acid damage (when encapsulated phage have been exposed to SGF) due to diffusion of acid into the microparticles [122,143,145]; hydrogel pores tend be in the nm range depending on the degree of crosslinking [175]. Dini et al. [122] showed that acid exposure of E. coli phage (pH 1.6, 30 min exposure) encapsulated in pure alginate microparticles resulted in complete loss of viable phage .

        <p>A number of studies have indicated that phage encapsulated in alginate-chitosan microparticles improves phage stability upon exposure to acid conditions however, the protection was not complete [122,143,145]. Ma et al ( [143], [145]) showed that Salmonella and S aureus phage are sensitive to the acidic pH of stomach and therefore required protection for enteric treatment; this was afforded by encapsulating phage in composite microparticles containing chitosan and alginate. Only a ~2.5 log decrease in Salmonella phage Felix O1 was shown after 1h exposure to simulated gastric fluid (containing pepsin) at pH2.4 compared with release of phage at pH6.8 [143]. Kim et al. [158] reported promising results for E. coli (Myoviridae) phage encapsulated in chitosan-alginate beads exposed to SGF (containing pepsin, 1h exposure at pH2 and pH2.5). For free phage, complete loss of viable phage was noted within 5min of acid exposure at pH2 and after 60min exposure at pH2.5. Additives such as maltose (disaccharide) have been added to formulations to improve storage stability of alginate encapsulated phage to prevent phage loss during air drying of microparticles. Ma et al. [143] exposed Salmonella Felix O1 phage encapsulated in chitosan-alginate micro-beads to simulated bile containing (exposure for 1h and 3h). Free phage showed a 1 log (1h exposure) and 2 log (3h exposure) reduction in phage titre. Microencapsulation in chitosan-alginate beads resulted in complete protection of phage to bile salt inactivation. Dini et al.

        <p>The concentration of encapsulating agent was found to be an important factor in affording phage protection from SGF. Increasing whey protein concentration in alginate-whey protein microparticles resulted in better acid protection by reducing permeation rates of acid and digestive enzymes [159].

The starting concentration of bacteria was 10 6 CFU/ml. After 10h of incubation in SIF, both free phage and encapsulated phage were unable to arrest bacterial growth (comparison with untreated controls) possibly due to presence of phage resistant mutant bacteria.

        <p>Microparticles with different compositions of alginate-whey protein encapsulating Salmonella Felix O1 phage were exposed to SIF (pH6.8) for 6h [157]. The microparticles were found to swell and eventually disintegrate. Encapsulated Salmonella Felix O1 phage showed sustained release profiles which varied depending on the amount of polymer content of the particles. For the same alginate content, increasing the whey protein concentration was found to slow the phage release rate. Whey protein hydrogels tend to swell readily at pH values above the protein isoelectric point (i.e.p. ~pH5.1) [199]. Pancreatin may also degrade whey protein provided it is able to diffuse into the hydrogel structure. This may explain increasing erosion rates after an initial period of exposure to SIF. Both whey protein and alginate possess negatively charged functional groups which would result in electrostatic repulsion and swelling of the gel upon exposure to alkaline SIF. Alginate-whey protein encapsulated S. aureus phage K released phage over a 2h period upon exposure to SIF (pH6.8) [159]. The microspheres were seen to swell and eventually disintegrate with sustained release of phage. Changes in formulation resulted in modest differences in the release profiles. Dried microspheres resulted in slower release of phage. Increasing concentrations of either alginate or whey protein retarded the release of phage K. L. lactis P008 phage encapsulated in alginate-whey protein showed a sustained release rate upon exposure to SIF over a 2h period [149].

        <p>Particle size was found to be an important factor influencing phage protection from SGF for acid permeable beads [159]. Alginate-whey protein microparticles having the same composition but different mean sizes showed larger particles protected phage better compared with smaller microparticles [159]. Larger particles keeping phage further away from the acid environment were better at protecting phage from acid damage [157].

In nearly all cases the thin-film hydration method has been used for liposome preparation.

Addition of an aqueous phage suspension to the dry lipid film results in the stacks of liquid crystalline lipid bilayers becoming fluid and swelling.

The residence time of nanoparticles has been shown to be longer compared to larger microparticles; larger particles are more prone to peristaltic action and rapid transit through the colon.

        <p>Interactions between charged particles and the mucus may be an appropriate strategy for intestinal delivery. Cationic delivery systems adhere to the negatively charged intestinal mucosa thereby promoting cellular uptake and subsequent drug release [211]. The mucins which comprise the mucosa are also known to be negatively charged. Anionic systems adhere to inflamed tissue via electrostatic interactions. The presence of positively charged proteins in the inflamed regions typically increases. Some authors suggest that unlike cationic particles which get immobilised on the mucus, anionic particles are able to diffuse through the mucus network due to decreased electrostatic interactions [170]. Other studies suggest that particles are entrapped within the mucin mesh no matter what charge they carry since the mucus displays negatively and positively charged proteins. Hence, if a non-adherent approach is needed, the nanoparticle surface could be decorated with specific moieties that confer so called 'stealth' properties [212]. Incorporating poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) on the surface of nanoparticles has been shown to result in a hydrophilic surface chemistry that allows unobstructed diffusion of nanoparticles through the epithelium. An explanation for this is that surface modification prevents strong interaction of nanoparticles with the mucus which typically prevents diffusion to the colitis tissue [213].Interactions between charged particles and the mucus may be an appropriate strategy for intestinal delivery.

        <p>Active targeting by surface functionalization of phage containing nanoparticles e.g. liposomes with ligands for selective phage accumulation at the site of infection may help increase the local concentration of phage delivered thereby increasing their therapeutic efficacy. Monoclonal antibodies and peptides specific for target sites have been used to increase specificity and enhance mucopenetrative properties [214]. It is thought that by incorporating ligands targeting receptors present at the site of infection may improve binding and thereby intensify endocytosis. Possible receptors for targets in the inflamed colon may include, ICAM-1 which is upregulated during inflammation, mannose receptors and macrophage galactose-type lectin (MGL) (expressed by activated macrophage).

        <p>Functionalization of liposomes for specific targeting may have an attractive future for phage delivery applications. Some pathogenic microorganisms such as M. tuberculosis and S. enterica (serovar Typhimurium) are able to survive specific antimicrobial machinery causing persistent infections. Longterm residence is achieved by internalization in mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). It is not fully understood how these bacteria inhibit their clearance by the immune system but common mechanisms include prevention of the normal maturation of the phagosomal environment or blockage of the fusion of the phagosome with endosome and lysosome. What happens afterwards is even less clear; bacteria can remain stored for years in an asymptomatic state that can suddenly be triggered into a potentially life-threatening active state, especially for people with a weak or compromised immune system. Liposomes innately accumulate in MPS due to their interaction with serum proteins that accelerates phagocytosis. It makes bacteriophage -encapsulated liposomes an appealing approach to treat antimicrobial resistant bacterial infections that spread from within the MPS. The rate of clearance depends on the physical/chemical characteristics of the vesicle` surface. It has been shown that uptake by MPS for liposomes is enhanced when phosphatidylserine incorporating PEG is used. On the other hand, long-circulating liposomes with high PEG value can accumulate at the site of infection due to increased permeability. Agrawal et al. [215] have demonstrated that Tuftsin, a tetrapeptide, used as a homing-device improves liposomes uptake by MPS cells but also stimulates these cells to take action against infections. Leishmaniasis, Aspergillus fumigatus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections have been treated with drug-loaded tuftsin-bearing liposomes and tuftsin-free liposomes and in all cases the treatment lead to enhanced effectiveness.Functionalization of liposomes for specific targeting may have an attractive future for phage delivery applications. Some pathogenic microorganisms such as M. tuberculosis and S. enterica (serovar Typhimurium) are able to survive specific antimicrobial machinery causing persistent infections. Longterm residence is achieved by internalization in mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). It is not fully understood how these bacteria inhibit their clearance by the immune system but common mechanisms include prevention of the normal maturation of the phagosomal environment or blockage of the fusion of the phagosome with endosome and lysosome. What happens afterwards is even less clear; bacteria can remain stored for years in an asymptomatic state that can suddenly be triggered into a potentially life-threatening active state, especially for people with a weak or compromised immune system. Liposomes innately accumulate in MPS due to their interaction with serum proteins that accelerates phagocytosis. It makes bacteriophage -encapsulated liposomes an appealing approach to treat antimicrobial resistant bacterial infections that spread from within the MPS. The rate of clearance depends on the physical/chemical characteristics of the vesicle` surface. It has been shown that uptake by MPS for liposomes is enhanced when phosphatidylserine incorporating PEG is used. On the other hand, long-circulating liposomes with high PEG value can accumulate at the site of infection due to increased permeability. Agrawal et al. [215] have demonstrated that Tuftsin, a tetrapeptide, used as a homing-device improves liposomes uptake by MPS cells but also stimulates these cells to take action against infections.

        <p>Phage therapy has recently been considered as an alternative to, or a supplement for, antibiotic treatment for mycobacterial respiratory infections. However, phage therapy for TB and other respiratory infections caused by non-tuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM) is complicated by the intracellular nature of the infection. It is generally recognised that phage do not diffuse across eukaryotic cell membranes and therefore would be unable to infect the intracellular mycobacteria [48]. Using a non-pathogenic mycobacterium, Mycobacterium smegmatis, infected with a mycobacteriophage as a 'Trojan horse' to deliver phage to the macrophage compartments in which M. avium resides, showed promise when tested in vitro with infected macrophage [216]. However, when used in a murine model of M. avium infection, this approach was less effective. It was deemed that the numbers of infected M. smegmatis cells required, would deliver too large a dose of antigenic material to be acceptable [217]. Alternative methods of delivery of phage to intracellular mycobacteria have been sought. Looking to the relatively routine use of liposome encapsulation for intracellular delivery of small molecule drugs [218], Neith et al. [150] recently suggested encapsulation of phage within liposomes may result in uptake of phage and delivery to the required intramacrophage compartment to initiate lytic infection of intracellular pathogens. To this end, they demonstrated successful encapsulation of mycobacteriophage TM4 in giant unilamellar vesicles. Furthermore, by encapsulation of a lambda phage expressing yellow fluorescent protein and fluorescent labelling of macrophage endosomal proteins, they were able to demonstrate intracellular delivery and colocalisation of the lambda phage and the endosomes; in Mtb infected macrophage , the mycobacterial phagosome fuses with early endosomes. This demonstration that liposome-encapsulated phage could gain access to the target mycobacteria satisfies a requirement for effective therapeutic use of bacteriophage to treat intracellular mycobacterial infections. A previous study using liposome encapsulation of frontline antituberculosis antibiotics, rifampicin and isoniazid, showed enhanced treatment in a murine infection model of Mtb compared with treatment with antibiotics alone [219]. The efficacy of a liposome-encapsulated mycobacteriophage to treat Mtb infection in macrophage or animal models remains to be demonstrated.Phage therapy has recently been considered as an alternative to, or a supplement for, antibiotic treatment for mycobacterial respiratory infections.

        <p>Fabrication of phage encapsulated polymer fibers (diameters ranging from tens of nanometers to microns) may readily be achieved using electrospinning, by drawing a charged polymer-in-solvent solution onto a grounded electrode while evaporating the solvent. A number of studies have shown the feasibility of encapsulating phage in nanofibers using the electrospinning technique (Table 2). A number of different polymers have been evaluated for encapsulating phage in fibers including cellulose diacetate [153], polyethylene oxide [106,153], polyvinyl alcohol [151,152] and polyvinyl pyrrolidone [101,118]. Good phage encapsulation results have been reported using water soluble or chloroform soluble polymers [106,118]. Rapid dehydration during electrospinning was shown to damage phages. Use of buffer and incorporation of sugars e.g. trehalose was shown to improve protection of phage [118]. Protection of phages in core-shell fibers using co-axial electrospinning technique was shown to be particularly promising [106,153]. Using immiscible solvents for the core (phage contained in an aqueous core) and shell (shell polymer dissolved in an organic water immiscible solvent) was found to stabilise the polymer jet resulting in the formation of a stable coreshell fiber structure [106,153]. In this process, aqueous solvent evaporation from the core is very slow thereby overcoming drastic changes in osmotic pressure in the phage containing core. Encapsulation of phages in nanoparticles formulated in an emulsion followed by electrospinning of the emulsion was another approach that was shown to result in improved phage protection during electrospinning [106].Fabrication of phage encapsulated polymer fibers (diameters ranging from tens of nanometers to microns) may readily be achieved using electrospinning, by drawing a charged polymer-in-solvent solution onto a grounded electrode while evaporating the solvent.

        <p>Increasing polymer molecular weight or blending different polymers (e.g. cellulose acetate/PEO) was shown to result in changes in the phage release kinetics from electrospun fibers [153]. The main reported mechanism of phage release from encapsulated fibers is typically swelling of fibers upon exposure to solvent followed by polymer erosion accompanied by phage diffusion and release. Encapsulating phage in hydrophilic water soluble polymers results in rapid phage release due to polymer dissolution whereas use of hydrophobic polymers or blends may allow tailoring of phage release to ensure slower release over a prolonged period.Increasing polymer molecular weight or blending different polymers (e.g. cellulose acetate/PEO) was shown to result in changes in the phage release kinetics from electrospun fibers [153].

        <p>The polymer and solvent combination used for fiber production were found to be important factors in the formation of nanofibers and retention of phage viability therein. Lee and Belcher (2004) spun fibers (diameters 100-200nm) containing E. coli M13 phage which retained infectivity against bacterial host when re-suspended in buffer. The phage containing fibers were spun from an aqueous polyvinyl pyrrolidone buffered solution containing phage ; the fibers were captured as a non-woven fibrous mat. Concentration of viable phage in the fibres was not reported. Salalha et al. [152] and Kuhn [151] encapsulated T4, T7, and  E. coli phage in electrospun nanofibres (diameter 250-400nm) prepared from aqueous poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) solutions. Nanofiber encapsulated phage were shown to retain viability and remained stable for three months stored at -20 Korehei and Kadla [106] evaluated emulsion electrospinning (pre-encapsulating phage in ~ 800nm alginate microparticles followed by lyophilization and then re-suspension in a polymer containing solvent followed by electrospinning) and coaxial electrospinning (incorporating the phage in a protective core in a core-shell fiber structure) processes to encapsulate E. coli T4 phage in polyethylene oxide fibers. The process of encapsulating phage in alginate nanoparticles resulted in a 1 log drop in phage titre. Freeze drying the phage encapsulated in nanospheres did not result in a drop in phage titre. Electrospraying the alginate suspension on its own (without polyethylene oxide) resulted in a large drop in phage titre from 10 8 PFU/ml to 10 3 PFU/ml. Polyethylene oxide (PEO) is soluble in both aqueous and organic solvents making it a suitable polymer for electrospinning. Polyethylene oxide fibers encapsulating alginate nanoparticles were found to result in fibers with a bead-on-string morphology (fiber diameter ~ 1µm). Dissolution of fibers in SM buffer showed a phage titre of 10 6 PFU/ml (a 2 log reduction). Fibers with diameter ~ 2 µm were prepared using a core/shell approach with the fiber shell made using PEO in chloroform and the core containing T4 phage in SM buffer [106]. Good lytic activity was retained post electrospinning with a high phage titre obtained (10 8 PFU/ml) with fibers dissolved in SM buffer. Storage stability of T4 phage in the core-shell fibers after freeze drying (freeze drying conditions were not reported in the paper and no details were given on whether any excipients were added) was investigated (stored at -20 • C resulted in a significant loss (&gt; 6 log reduction) in phage titre. Upon exposure of PEO fibers to SM buffer, fibers were seen to swell followed by disintegration (within 10min) resulting in release of phage for the alginate-emulsion based fibers and the core-shell fibers. Initial rate of phage release was faster from the core-shell fibers (the resulting final titre was also higher) compared with the alginate nanoparticle encapsulated fibers. Korehei and Kadla [153] varied the molecular weight (MW) of PEO (100kDa -600kDa) and blended hydrophilic PEO with the hydrophobic polymer cellulose diacetate (CDA). E. coli T4 phage encapsulated in fibers produced using different PEO/CDA showed slow release of phage depending on the PEO MW and the ratio of PEO/CDA. Higher PEO MW (results in increased polymer entanglements) and greater proportion of hydrophobic CDA (slower rate of polymer swelling and erosion) resulted in slower release of phage.The polymer and solvent combination used for fiber production were found to be important factors in the formation of nanofibers and retention of phage viability therein.

        <p>Microbial biofilms on medical devices e.g. urinary and central venous catheters, stents, implants, invasive health monitoring devices, are a significant healthcare problem and are responsible for a vast majority of medical device associated infections. Bioactive packaging materials are also attractive in other areas including food packaging e.g. ready-to-eat meat, ready cut fruits and poultry [155]. Antibiofilm formation strategies include oriented immobilization by covalent attachment of bacteriophage to polymer surfaces [223] or immobilisation of bacteriophage in stimuli responsive surfaces where release is triggered in response to an external stimulus [148]. Although phage immobilisation on surfaces may readily be achieved through passive adsorption [224], the process is inefficient with loss of phage activity due to poor orientation of phage tails needed to recognise and infect target bacteria. Chemical biotinylation of the phage capsid head has been used for oriented immobilisation (to retain phage lytic activity by leaving the tail fibers free in order to capture bacteria) of a Salmonella enteritidis phage on streptavidin-labelled magnetic beads [225]. Tolba et al. [226] used phage display technology to introduce affinity tags on the capsid head to immobilise E.coli phage on streptavidin coated magnetic and cellulose beads. Pearson et al. [223] covalently attached lytic E.coli and S. aureus phage through reaction of primary amine groups on the capsid head with R-COOH surface groups (generated using microwave plasma in the presence of maleic anhydride) on polyethylene and polytetrafluoroethylene surfaces. Anany et al. [227] and Lone et al. [155] utilised the electrostatic interaction between the anionic capsid head of E. coli O157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes phage cocktails and polyvinylamine treated cellulose membranes. Modification of cellulose membranes resulted in greater numbers of infective phage oriented correctly. A recent patent focuses on controlled covalent attachment of bioactive bacteriophage to a hydrogel coating material for regulating biofilm development with examples focusing on biofilm reduction on urinary catheters [228]. An earlier patent gave examples of phage immobilisation on nylon sutures for wound healing applications [229]. Cooper et al. [230] used carbodiimide oriented covalent attachment of a tailed P. aeruginosa bacteriophage to magnetised multiwalled carbon nanotubes. Preliminary results showed antimicrobial efficacy of bacteriophage -nanocomposite conjugates against P. aeruginosa. Handa et al. [231] employed chemical vapour deposition to make a smooth aminosilane monolayer on a glass substrate. Subsequently, monolayers of covalently bound Salmonella specific phage were attached to the aminosilane monolayer using well-established sulfo-NHS (N-Hydroxysulfosuccinimide) and EDC (1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl] carbodiimide hydrochloride) chemistry [231]. Techniques for attachment of phage to gold substrates has been investigated to increase their diagnostic utility as part of quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), surface plasmon resonance (SPR) transduction based diagnostic platforms [232] or direct detection as part of virus electrodes [233]. Recently, Richter et al.

        <p>Advanced techniques may be applied for phage encapsulation to precisely control the size and architecture of phage containing micro-and nano-particles. To-date methods used for phage encapsulation have not utilised state-of-the art processing techniques that could be applied for the encapsulation of phage to achieve controlled dosage forms in uniform micro-and nanoparticles. Membrane emulsification (ME) is one such process that allows formation of uniform drops by injecting a dispersed phase liquid through a microporous membrane into the continuous phase (Figure 3a). Alternatively, a pre-emulsified mixture of the dispersed and continuous phase may be repeatedly injected through the membrane (Figure 3b). To encapsulate bacteriophage , the formed drops, typically composed of a mixture of the wall forming materials, solvent(s) and phage , could be solidified under mild agitation using various solidification reactions or processes, such as free-radical polymerisation, polycondensation, ionotropic/thermal gelation, cooling crystallisation, and molecular or particle self-assembly triggered by solvent evaporation [236]. The advantages of ME over standard emulsification procedures using high-pressure valve homogenisers or rotor-stator devices are in higher drop size uniformity and lower energy inputs and applied shear, which can be useful to preserve phage integrity. It is well known that bacteriophage are sensitive to mechanical shearing [104,128]. In direct ME, the shear rate on the membrane surface is ~10 3 -10 4 s -1 however, uniform drops may be obtained without any shear by spontaneous droplet formation driven by Laplace pressure gradients [237]. The shear rate in high-shear mixers and colloid mills is typically ~10 5 s -1 and can exceed 10 7 s -1 in microfluidizers. The most common membranes used in ME are Shirasu Porous Glass (SPG) (Figure 3c) and microsieve metallic membranes [238]. Shear on the membrane surface required for drop detachment can be generated in various ways including; (i) using a paddle stirrer placed above the membrane surface (Figure 3d) [239]; (ii) rotating membrane [240] and (iii) oscillating membrane [241]. In the oscillating ME system, the tubular membrane can oscillate tangentially clockwise or counter-clockwise [242] or radially upward and downward (Figure 3e) [241], with frequencies ranging from 10 to 90 Hz.Advanced techniques may be applied for phage encapsulation to precisely control the size and architecture of phage containing micro-and nano-particles.

        <p>Bacteriophage containing microcapsules could be fabricated using microfluidic devices with unprecedented uniformity and control over the size, shape and morphology [243,244]. The process involves creation of drops in a variety of geometries consisting of micrometre length scale channels designed to bring two or more immiscible fluid streams into contact with one another. This is followed by conversion of the generated drops into solid particles (using techniques discussed earlier). The variation of drop sizes in microfluidic devices is negligible (less than 3%) and encapsulation efficiency of bacteriophage can reach 100%. The drop productivity can exceed 10,000 drops per second [245], however, the flow rate of the dispersed phase is modest (0.01-10 mL h -1 per drop generation unit -DGU). The most common planar DGUs are co-flow drop makers in which immiscible fluids meet in parallel streams, cross-flow drop makers or microfluidic junctions in which the immiscible fluid streams meet at an angle to one another, and flow-focusing drop makers in which there is a geometric element, such as a constriction, that causes the streams to accelerate, narrowing the inner fluid thread and causing it to break into drops [243].Bacteriophage containing microcapsules could be fabricated using microfluidic devices with unprecedented uniformity and control over the size, shape and morphology [243,244]. The process involves creation of drops in a variety of geometries consisting of micrometre length scale channels designed to bring two or more immiscible fluid streams into contact with one another. This is followed by conversion of the generated drops into solid particles (using techniques discussed earlier). The variation of drop sizes in microfluidic devices is negligible (less than 3%) and encapsulation efficiency of bacteriophage can reach 100%.

        <p>Microfluidic emulsification allows for precise fabrication of structured multiple emulsions with controlled drop morphology. Conventional multiple emulsions are composed of numerous drops of the inner phase dispersed within larger drops of the middle phase, which itself is dispersed in an outer phase (Figure 4a). The middle phase must be immiscible with both the inner and outer phase. A W 1 /O/W 2 emulsion consists of drops of the inner water phase W 1 dispersed within the oil drops, which are then dispersed in the outer water phase W 2 . Bacteriophage typically would be suspended in W 1 phase and the oil phase would contain a suspended or dissolved encapsulating shell material such as a polymer. Microfluidic methods can be used to produce multiple emulsion drops consisting of a controlled number of inner drops encapsulated within each large drop (Figure 4b) [246]. The number and content of individual inner drops can be controlled thereby allowing the loading of bacteriophage to be precisely manipulated [246,247]. The distinct inner drops can be used to achieve simultaneous encapsulation of two or more types of bacteriophage in separate microenvironments and to control the loading for each of them. Thus phage cocktails may be individually formulated to overcome the limitations of one formulation having to suit all.Microfluidic emulsification allows for precise fabrication of structured multiple emulsions with controlled drop morphology.

        <p>Microfluidic methods can be used to prepare multiple emulsion drops with concentric onion-like shells around the core drop (Figure 4c). Droplets with different numbers of shells may be synthesised depending of the number of immiscible phases within each drop e.g. [248]. High-order multiple emulsions may be useful in the production of complex capsules for co-encapsulation and simultaneous or sequential release of several multi-component actives (Figure 4c) [249]. Multiple shells would allow tailored formulations within a single capsule e.g. an outer acid stable shell may protect phage from the stomach acidity, an inner burst release shell for bolus delivery of phage with an innermost sustained release shell resulting in slow sustained phage release over a significant time period negating the need for repeated phage dosing.Microfluidic methods can be used to prepare multiple emulsion drops with concentric onion-like shells around the core drop (Figure 4c).

        <p>Other approaches might include phage encapsulation in Janus particles composed of two hemispheres with various physical and chemical properties (Figure 4d). Janus drops typically have two distinct regions of roughly equal surface area, however, the term has expanded to include all multi-segment droplet structures with regions of different composition co-existing in asymmetric geometries [250]. Janus particles may be used to encapsulate bacteriophage in different polymers having different in vivo degradation rates to achieve burst release followed by controlled sustained release.Other approaches might include phage encapsulation in Janus particles composed of two hemispheres with various physical and chemical properties (Figure 4d).

        <p>Implementation of phage therapy necessitates the use of phage cocktails to overcome the limited host range of an individual phage and the risk of phage resistant bacterial mutants. High doses of phage need to be reliably delivered at the site of infection. Repeated frequent dosing of phage may be impractical hence, encapsulation of phage in sustained release systems is needed. Bacteriophage susceptibility to chemical and physical stresses differs among phage families and also within a family. Careful consideration needs to be given to ensure the formulation chemistry and processing conditions are suited to phage making-up the cocktail in order to ensure reproducible retention of high phage titres and stability during long term storage. Further research is urgently needed in the field of phage formulation and encapsulation to adequately support any future phage therapy field.Implementation of phage therapy necessitates the use of phage cocktails to overcome the limited host range of an individual phage and the risk of phage resistant bacterial mutants.
