        <p>These joint practice guidelines, or procedure standards, were developed collaboratively by the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM), the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI), the European Association of Neurooncology (EANO), and the working group for Response Assessment in Neurooncology with PET (PET-RANO). Brain PET imaging is being increasingly used to supplement MRI in the clinical management of glioma. The aim of these standards/ guidelines is to assist nuclear medicine practitioners in recommending, performing, interpreting and reporting the results of brain PET imaging in patients with glioma to achieve a high-quality imaging standard for PET using FDG and the radiolabelled amino acids MET, FET and FDOPA. This will help promote the appropriate use of PET imaging and contribute to evidence-based medicine that may improve the diagnostic impact of this technique in neurooncological practice.

        <p>Gliomas are the second most common primary brain tumour with an annual incidence rate of around six cases per 100,000 individuals worldwide [1]. Gliomas represent approximately 27% of all central nervous system (CNS) tumours and 80% of malignant CNS tumours, and are a leading cause of cancer mortality in adults. The most common of all malignant brain and CNS tumours is glioblastoma (46%) which is associated with a median overall survival of 15 months in patients treated with maximal safe tumour resection, concomitant radiotherapy/chemotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy [2].Gliomas are the second most common primary brain tumour with an annual incidence rate of around six cases per 100,000 individuals worldwide [1].

        <p>There are defined objective and standardized MRI-based criteria for response assessment in neurooncology (RANO) applied to clinical trials in patients with brain tumours. However, MRI contrast enhancement can be unreliable as a surrogate for tumour size or growth. It nonspecifically reflects vascular surface area and the permeability of the contrast agent across a disrupted blood-tumour barrier and may represent tumour biology or a number of other factors including therapy-induced inflammation. Contrast enhancement can be influenced by therapeutics that affect tumour vascular permeability, such as corticosteroid, antiangiogenic [3] or immunotherapy agents [4]. Because of the growing awareness of significant limitations of MRI in the management of glioma, the RANO criteria were recently updated [5]. Hence, to identify infiltrative glioma tissue, the RANO definition of tumour progression was supplemented by inclusion of Bsignificant^enlarging areas of nonenhancing tumour on MRI T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image sequences. However, precise quantification of increases in the T2/FLAIR signal could not be defined and other causes of increased T2 or FLAIR signal, such as radiation effects, demyelination, ischaemic injury and oedema have to be considered in the evaluation of progression.There are defined objective and standardized MRI-based criteria for response assessment in neurooncology (RANO) applied to clinical trials in patients with brain tumours.

Fusion with other MRI sequences is optional. 2. SUVs used directly are generally of limited value in the clinical interpretation of FDG PET neurooncology studies. 3. Qualitative visual analysis can be performed and the lesion of interest can be classified as either positive, when FDG uptake visually exceeds the activity in a reference region (e.g. normal appearing white matter or cerebral cortex), or negative, when FDG uptake in the lesion is less than that in the reference region. Using white matter as the reference region provides better sensitivity for detecting recurrent tumour at the expense of specificity, while using cerebral cortex provides better specificity at the expense of sensitivity. 4. Lesion to reference region ratios using mean or maximum SUV can be used to provide a measure of FDG uptake in lesions. Numerical cut-off values for distinguishing tumour from benign lesions, such as radiation necrosis, and for grading tumours are not well established for FDG. If ratios are used, either white or grey matter rather than a mixture of the two should be used for reference due to the substantially higher FDG uptake in grey matter than in white matter. Additionally, normal-appearing brain should be considered for the reference region to provide consistency across studies. 5. The regional metabolic rate of glucose can be estimated in lesions and normal brain by compartmental modelling or by using graphical analytical approaches. A correction factor, the so-called Blumped constant^ [30], can be used to convert the FDG values to values reflecting glucose metabolism [31]. However, little is known about the accuracy of these methods in brain tumours and/or treatment effects.

It is advisable to adhere to the recommendations of the manufacturer (i.e. follow the planned maintenance intervals). For PET/MRI systems an approach to basic MRI QC to be performed by the user is described in a review by Sattler et al. [93].While there are no regulatory requirements for special/standard QC/QA procedures for MRI systems, numerous points should be considered for conducting safe and high-quality MRI examinations as outlined in section Examination procedures/specifications.

        <p>The systemic use of radiotracers leads to systemic exposure of the patients to radiation. The amounts of radioactivity usually delivered with the administration of 11 C-labelled and 18 F-labelled PET radioligands (see section Administered activity in adults) result in effective doses (ED) of the same order of magnitude as delivered by other 11 C-labelled and 18 F-labelled radiotracers [94]. The radiation dose from low-dose CT scans of the head region depends on the CT scanning parameters and is generally well below 0.5 mSv. The overall ED from PET/ CT investigations of the head region, when accounting for the whole-body exposure, should remain near or below 5 mSv. In adults, the organ with the highest radiation dose for all the above tracers is the urinary bladder wall (Table 3).The systemic use of radiotracers leads to systemic exposure of the patients to radiation.

        <p>Since the previous EANM guidelines in 2006 [10], the clinical use of molecular imaging with PET and PET/CT in the diagnosis of glioma has continuously increased in Europe and the US. For successful and appropriate use of this technology, a clear understanding of the capabilities and limitations of the technology and appropriate patient selection, preparation, scan acquisition and image reconstruction are required. This document attempts to provide some guidance on the performance and interpretation of molecular imaging to supplement recent clinical guidelines [7], and to bring PET brain imaging into daily clinical practice and into larger scale interinstitutional clinical neurooncological trials across imaging platforms. Ethical approval These guidelines do not describe any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.Since the previous EANM guidelines in 2006 [10], the clinical use of molecular imaging with PET and PET/CT in the diagnosis of glioma has continuously increased in Europe and the US.

        <p>. In longitudinal studies, the patient should always be scanned on the same system using the same procedures to avoid changes related to differences in imaging technology or methodology. In cross-sectional studies, possible differences among scans related to the technologies being used should be considered. Particular care is needed in paediatric patients..
