        <p>The Anopheles gambiae 1000 Genomes Consortium*</p>
        <p>The sustainability of malaria control in Africa is threatened by the rise of insecticide resistance in Anopheles mosquitoes, which transmit the disease 1 . To gain a deeper understanding of how mosquito populations are evolving, here we sequenced the genomes of 765 specimens of Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles coluzzii sampled from 15 locations across Africa, and identified over 50 million single nucleotide polymorphisms within the accessible genome. These data revealed complex population structure and patterns of gene flow, with evidence of ancient expansions, recent bottlenecks, and local variation in effective population size. Strong signals of recent selection were observed in insecticide-resistance genes, with several sweeps spreading over large geographical distances and between species. The design of new tools for mosquito control using gene-drive systems will need to take account of high levels of genetic diversity in natural mosquito populations.</p>
        <p>Blood-sucking mosquitoes of the An. gambiae species complex are the principal vectors of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Africa. Substantial reductions in malaria morbidity and mortality have been achieved by the use of insecticide-based interventions 2 , but increasing levels of insecticide resistance and other adaptive changes in mosquito populations threaten to reverse these gains 1 . A better understanding of the molecular, ecological and evolutionary processes driving these changes is essential to maximize the active lifespan of existing insecticides, and to accelerate the development of new strategies and tools for vector control. The Anopheles gambiae 1000 Genomes Project (Ag1000G; http://www.malariagen.net/ag1000g) was established to provide a foundation for detailed investigation of mosquito genome variation and evolution. Here we report the first phase of the project, which analysed 765 wild-caught specimens of An. gambiae sensu stricto and An. coluzzii. These two species account for the majority of malaria transmission in Africa, and are morphologically indistinguishable and often sympatric, but are genetically distinct 3,4 and differ in geographical range 5 , larval ecology 6 , behaviour 7 and strategies for surviving the dry season 8 . The specimens were collected at 15 locations across 8 African countries, spanning a range of ecologies including rainforest, inland savannah and coastal biomes, and thus provide a broad sample in which to explore factors shaping mosquito population variation (Extended Data Fig. 1; Supplementary Information 1).</p>
        <p>Specimens were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq platform, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified by alignment against the AgamP3 reference genome (Methods; Supplementary Information 2). A rigorous evaluation of data quality, including the use of experimental genetic crosses to quantify error rates, identified genomic regions totalling 141 megabases (Mb; 61% of the reference genome) that were accessible for the analysis of population variation (Supplementary Information 3; Extended Data Fig. 2). We identified 52,525,957 high-quality SNPs, of which 21% had three or more alleles, an average of one variant allele every 2.2 bases of the accessible genome (Fig. 1a). Individual mosquitoes carried between 1.7 and 2.7 million variant alleles, with no systematic difference observed between the two species (Extended Data Fig. 3a). In most populations, nucleotide</p>
        <p>diversity was 1.5% on average (Extended Data Fig. 3b) and more than 3% at synonymous coding sites (Extended Data Fig. 3c), confirming that these are among the most genetically diverse eukaryotic species 9 .</p>
        <p>High levels of natural diversity have practical implications for the development of gene-drive technologies for mosquito control 10 . CRISPR-Cas9 gene drives can be designed to edit a specific gene and confer a phenotype such as female sterility, which could suppress mosquito populations and thereby reduce disease transmission. However, naturally occurring polymorphisms within the approximately 21-base-pair (bp) Cas9 target site could prevent target recognition, and thus undermine gene-drive efficacy in the field. We found viable Cas9 targets in 11,625 protein-coding genes, but only 5,474 genes remained after excluding target sites with nucleotide variation in any of the 765 genomes sequenced here (Extended Data Fig. 3d; Supplementary Information 5). Resistance to gene drive could be countered by designing constructs that target multiple sites within the same gene, and we identified 863 genes that each contain at least 10 non-overlapping conserved target sites, including 13 putative sterility genes 10 (Supplementary Information 5.2). However, clearly more variants remain to be discovered (Extended Data Fig. 3d), and extensive sampling of multiple populations will be needed to inform the design of gene drives that are robust to natural genetic variation.</p>
        <p>An. gambiae and An. coluzzii have a geographical range that spans sub-Saharan Africa and encompasses a variety of ecological settings 5 . Previous studies have found evidence that populations are locally adapted, and that migration between populations is limited by both geographical distance and major ecological discontinuities, notably the Congo Basin tropical rainforest and the East African rift system [11][12][13][14] . As a starting point for the analysis of population structure, we constructed neighbour-joining trees to explore patterns of genetic similarity between individuals (Fig. 1b; Supplementary Information 6.1). We observed four contrasting patterns of relatedness, associated with different regions of the genome. Within pericentromeric regions of chromosomes X, 3 and arm 2R, mosquitoes segregated into two highly distinct clades, largely corresponding to the two species as determined by conventional molecular diagnostics, consistent with previous studies that showed that genome regions of reduced recombination are associated with stronger differentiation between closely related species 15 . The large chromosomal inversions 2La and 2Rb were each associated with a distinct pattern of relatedness, as expected if recombination is reduced between inversion karyotypes. In most of the remaining genome, there was evidence of clustering by geographical region but not by species. There were also some genome regions in which we found unusually short genetic distances between individuals from different countries and/or species, indicating the influence of recent selective sweeps and adaptive gene flow.</p>
        <p>To investigate geographical sub-divisions in more detail, we focused on euchromatic regions of chromosome 3, which are free from polymorphic inversions and regions of reduced recombination (Supplementary Information 6). ADMIXTURE models and principal component analysis (PCA) supported five major ancestral populations, represented by: (i) An. gambiae from Guinea, Burkina Faso, Cameroon and Uganda; (ii) An. gambiae from Gabon; (iii) all individuals from Kenya; (iv) An. coluzzii from Angola; and (v) An. coluzzii from Burkina Faso and all individuals from Guinea-Bissau (Fig. 2; Extended Data Figs 4,5). Within each species, we found relatively high allele frequency differentiation across the Congo Basin rainforest, exceeding differentiation between the two species at a single location (Extended Data Fig. 5b). There were also more subtle distinctions within and between populations. For example, in Cameroon, mosquitoes were sampled along a cline from savannah into forest, and there was some population structure associated with these different ecologies. However, among An. gambiae populations north of the Congo Basin, differentiation was extremely weak overall, despite considerable distances between populations, suggesting substantial gene flow.</p>
        <p>Earlier studies concluded that purposeful movement of Anopheles mosquitoes is limited to short-range dispersal of up to 5 km 16 ; however, recent evidence has emerged for long-distance seasonal migration in An. gambiae 8 . To explore evidence for migration, we computed joint site frequency spectra for selected population pairs and fitted models of population history (Methods; Supplementary Information 8). For all pairs examined, models with migration provided a better fit than models without migration (Supplementary Table 2). The inferred rate of migration was high between An. gambiae savannah populations, but some migration was also inferred between species and across both the Congo Basin rainforest and the East African rift. Although these analyses do not allow us to infer the timing or direction of gene flow events, they suggest that mosquito migration between different parts of the continent could affect the spread of insecticide resistance and dynamics of disease transmission.</p>
        <p>A key question in mosquito evolution concerns the extent and effect of gene flow between species, and An. gambiae and An. coluzzii are known to undergo hybridization at a rate that varies over space and time 17 . To study this phenomenon, we analysed 506 SNPs previously found to be highly differentiated between the two species 18 (Extended Data Fig. 6; Supplementary Information 6.6). These ancestry-informative markers (AIMs) showed that a genomic region on chromosome arm 2L has introgressed from An. gambiae into An. coluzzii in Burkina Faso and Angola. This region spans the Vgsc gene, in which introgression of insecticide-resistance alleles has been reported in Ghana 19 and Mali 20 , although this is the first evidence, to our knowledge, that introgressed alleles have spread to An. coluzzii south of the Congo Basin. AIMs also highlighted two populations with uncertain species status. In Guinea-Bissau, mosquitoes carried a mixture of alleles from both species on all chromosomes. These individuals were sampled from the coast, within a region of West Africa that is thought to be a zone of secondary contact because previous studies have found evidence for extensive introgression 21,22 . We also found that mosquitoes from coastal Kenya carried a mixture of both species' alleles on all chromosomes. This was unexpected, as the geographical range of An. coluzzii is not thought to extend beyond the East African rift. There are several possible explanations for the Kenyan data, including historical admixture between species and retention of ancestral variation, and further analysis and population sampling are required. However, our data demonstrate that a simple gambiae/coluzzii dichotomy is not adequate for describing malaria vector species composition in some parts of Africa, and caution against the use of any single marker to infer species ancestry or recent hybridization.</p>
        <p>Historical fluctuations in effective population size (N e ) can be inferred from the genomes of extant individuals. Analysis of our genome variation data indicated a major expansion in all populations north of the Congo Basin and west of the East African rift (Fig. 3a; Extended Data Fig. 7; Methods; Supplementary Information 8). Knowledge of the Anopheles mutation rate is required to date this expansion, and this has not yet been determined, but assuming it is similar to Drosophila then the onset of expansion would be within the range 7,000 to 25,000 years ago (Fig. 3a; Methods). Because An. gambiae and An. coluzzii are highly anthropophilic, mosquito population expansion could be linked to that of humans, and particularly to the expansion of agricultural Bantu-speaking groups that originate from north of the Congo Basin beginning approximately 5,000 years ago 23 . It is possible to reconcile this theory with our data if Anopheles has a higher mutation rate than Drosophila, causing us to overestimate the age of the expansion, but it is also possible that mosquito populations benefited from earlier human population growth, or that other factors such as climate change were involved. We also observed genomic signatures of a major recent population decline of An. gambiae in coastal Kenya. All Kenyan specimens (but no specimens from other locations) had long runs of homozygosity that comprised 10-60% of the genome, indicating high levels of inbreeding consistent with a recent population bottleneck (Fig. 3b). In Kenya, free mass distribution of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) starting in 2006 resulted in a major increase in ITN coverage 24 . The specimens in this study were collected in 2012, raising the question of whether the population decline of An. gambiae can be attributed to ITN usage. To address this question, we analysed sharing of genome regions that are identical by descent (IBD) (Methods; Extended Data Fig. 8a,b). We estimated that the An. gambiae population in Kenya has fallen in size by at least two orders of magnitude, to N e &lt; 1,000 (Extended Data Fig. 8c; Supplementary Information 8.4). The beginning of this inferred decline occurred approximately 200 generations before the date of sampling, which would pre-date mass distributions of ITNs, assuming approximately 11 generations per year. This is consistent with other studies that have found evidence for low N e values 11 and changes in mosquito species abundance 25 in the region before high levels of ITN coverage. Nevertheless, our data show that major demographic events leave genetic signatures that could be used to gain important information about the impact of vector control interventions.</p>
        <p>Many genes have been associated with insecticide resistance in Anopheles, but different genetic variants may be responsible for resistance in different populations, and it is not yet clear where or how resistance is spreading. Genomic data can help to address these questions by identifying genes with evidence of recent evolutionary adaptation in one or more mosquito populations. We found strong signals of recent positive selection at several genes that are known to have a role in resistance, including: Vgsc, the target site for dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and pyrethroid insecticides 26 ; Gste, a cluster of glutathione S-transferase genes including Gste2, previously implicated in the metabolism of DDT and pyrethroids 27 ; and Cyp6p, a cluster of genes encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes, including Cyp6p3, which is upregulated in permethrin-and bendiocarb-resistant mosquitoes 28 (Extended Data Fig. 9; Supplementary Information 9). We also observed strong signals of selection at multiple loci with no known resistance genes, and these merit detailed investigation in future studies.</p>
        <p>Mutations in An. gambiae Vgsc codon 995 (orthologous to Musca domestica Vgsc codon 1014), known as 'kdr' owing to their knockdown-resistance phenotype, reduce susceptibility to DDT and pyrethroids 26 . We found the leucine-to-phenylalanine (Leu995Phe) kdr variant at high frequency in West and Central Africa (Guinea 100%; Burkina Faso 93%; Cameroon 53%; Gabon 36%; Angola 86%). A second kdr allele, a leucine-to-serine (Leu995Ser) variant, was present in Central and East Africa (Cameroon 15%; Gabon 65%; Uganda 100%; Kenya 76%). To investigate the evolution and spread of the two kdr alleles, we analysed the genetic backgrounds on which they were carried (Fig. 4; Supplementary Information 9.3). Leu995Phe occurred within five distinct haplotype clusters (labelled F 1 -F 5 in Fig. 4), whereas Leu995Ser was found in a further 5 haplotype clusters (labelled S 1 -S 5 in Fig. 4). Cluster F 1 contained individuals of both species and from four countries spanning the Congo Basin, proving that recent gene flow has carried resistance alleles between these populations. Three kdr haplotypes (F 4 , F 5 and S 2 ) were found in both Cameroon and Gabon, providing multiple examples of recent gene flow between these two populations. The S 3 haplotype was present in both Uganda and coastal Kenya, thus resistance alleles can reach populations on both sides of the rift system.</p>
        <p>Although the evolution of resistance in the Vgsc gene is clearly driven primarily by the two kdr alleles, we also found 15 other non-synonymous variants at a frequency of above 1% in our cohort (Fig. 4). Thirteen of these variants occurred almost exclusively on haplotypes carrying the Leu995Phe allele (Lewontin's D′ &gt; 0.96). These included Asn1570Tyr, previously found on Leu995Phe haplotypes in West and Central Africa and shown to confer increased resistance 29 . Overall, there was a statistically significant enrichment for non-synonymous mutations on haplotypes carrying the Leu995Phe allele, indicating secondary selection on multiple variants that either enhance or compensate for the Leu995Phe phenotype (Supplementary Information 9.5).</p>
        <p>Resistance due to genes that enhance insecticide metabolism is also a serious concern, as it has been implicated in extreme resistance phenotypes in some Anopheles populations 27,28 . Although several metabolic genes have been shown to be upregulated in resistant mosquitoes, only a single molecular marker of metabolic resistance (Gste2-Ile114Thr) has previously been identified in An. gambiae or An. coluzzii 27 . At both Gste and Cyp6p, we found evidence that resistance has emerged on several genetic backgrounds and is spreading between species and over considerable distances. At the Gste locus, we found at least four distinct haplotypes under selection (Extended Data Fig. 10a). One of these haplotypes carried the known Gste2-Ile114Thr resistance allele, and this haplotype was found in all populations except Guinea-Bissau and Uganda, indicating a continent-wide spread. However, the other three haplotypes did not carry this allele, thus other genetic variants with a resistance phenotype must be present at this locus. At the Cyp6p locus, we found at least eight distinct haplotypes under selection, but limited spread between populations (Extended Data Fig. 10b).</p>
        <p>At both loci, we found multiple SNPs associated with haplotypes under selection that could be used as markers to track the spread of resistance and characterize resistance phenotypes (Extended Data Fig. 10).</p>
        <p>In 1899, Ronald Ross proposed that malaria could be controlled by destroying breeding sites of the mosquitoes that transmit the disease 30 . An. gambiae, identified in the same year by Ross as a vector of malaria in Africa, has proved resilient to a century of attempts to repress it. The vector control armamentarium needs to be expanded, not only with new classes of insecticide and genetic control strategies, but also with tools to gather intelligence, to enable those responsible for planning and executing interventions to stay ahead of the mosquito's remarkable capacity for rapid evolutionary adaptation. There remain major knowledge gaps concerning the ecology and life history of Anopheles mosquitoes, such as the rate and range of migration, which are fundamental to understand both malaria transmission and the spread of insecticide resistance, and which will require spatiotemporal analysis of mosquito populations. Most importantly, it is essential to start collecting population genomic data prospectively as an integral part of vector control interventions, to identify which strategies are causing increased insecticide resistance, or what it takes to cause a population crash of the magnitude observed in our Kenyan data. By treating each intervention as an experiment, and by analysing its effect on both mosquito and parasite populations, we can aim to improve the efficacy and sustainability of future interventions, while at the same time learning about basic processes in ecology and evolution. (white denotes reference allele; black denotes alternative allele; red denotes previously known resistance allele). At the lower margin, we label 10 haplotype clusters carrying a kdr allele (either Leu995Phe or Leu995Ser). The inset map depicts haplotypes that are shared between populations, demonstrating the spread of insecticide resistance.</p>

        <p>Population sampling. Mosquitoes were collected from natural populations at 15 sampling sites in 8 African countries (Extended Data Fig. 1). Sampling locations, dates, specimen collection methods and DNA extraction methods are given in Supplementary Information 1.1. We also performed genetic crosses between adult mosquitoes obtained from laboratory colonies (Supplementary Information 1.2). Parents and progeny of four crosses were contributed to Ag1000G phase 1 (Extended Data Fig. 1). No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. Whole-genome sequencing. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. Paired-end multiplex libraries were prepared using the manufacturer's protocol, with the exception that genomic DNA was fragmented using Covaris Adaptive Focused Acoustics rather than nebulization. Multiplexes consisted of 12 tagged individual mosquitoes, and 3 lanes of sequencing were generated for each multiplex to even out variation in yield between sequencing runs. Cluster generation and sequencing were undertaken per the manufacturer's protocol for paired-end 100-bp sequence reads with insert size in the range 100-200 bp. Sequence analysis and variant calling. Sequence reads were aligned to the AgamP3 reference genome 31 using bwa 32 and SNPs were discovered using 
            <rs type="software">GATK</rs> following best practice recommendations 33,34 (Supplementary Information 3.1-3.2). After sample quality control, we analysed data on 765 wild-caught specimens and a further 80 specimens comprising parents and progeny from the four laboratory crosses (Supplementary Information 3.3). The alignments were also used to identify genome regions accessible to SNP calling, where short reads could be uniquely mapped and there was minimal evidence for structural variation (Supplementary Information 3.4). Mendelian errors in the crosses were used to guide the design of filters to remove poor-quality variant calls (Supplementary Information 3.5). We performed capillary sequencing of five genes in 58 individual mosquitoes to provide an estimate for the SNP false discovery rate, sensitivity and genotyping accuracy (Supplementary Information 3.6). We also performed genotyping by primer-extension mass spectrometry using the Sequenom 
            <rs type="software">MassARRAY</rs> platform at 158 SNPs in 229 individual mosquitoes to provide a second estimate for genotyping accuracy (Supplementary Information 3.7). Haplotype estimation. We used SHAPEIT2 to perform statistical phasing with information from sequence reads 35 for all wild-caught individuals (Supplementary Information 4.1). We assessed phasing performance by comparison with haplotypes generated from the crosses and from male X chromosome haplotypes (Supplementary Information 4.2; Extended Data Fig. 2b,c). Population structure. To investigate variation in patterns of relatedness along the genome, we performed a windowed analysis using genetic distance and neighbour-joining trees (NJT). We divided the genome into 1,418 contiguous non-overlapping windows, where each window contained 100 kb of accessible positions. Within each window, we computed the city-block distance between all pairs of individuals. We used these distance matrices to construct a NJT for each window. We then computed the Pearson correlation coefficient between all pairs of distance matrices, and performed a singular value decomposition (SVD) on the correlation matrix. The resulting SVD components were used to identify major patterns of relatedness (Supplementary Information 6.1). We analysed geographical population structure using ADMIXTURE 36 and PCA 37 . For these analyses, we used biallelic SNPs from within the regions 3R: 1-37 Mb and 3L: 15-41 Mb and with minor allele frequency ≥ 1%, then each chromosome arm was randomly down-sampled to 100,000 variants using 10 different random seeds to provide 10 replicate variant sets, and then each set was pruned to remove variants in linkage disequilibrium (Supplementary Information 6.2). For each of the 10 replicate variant sets, ADMIXTURE was run for K (number of ancestral populations) from 2 to 11 with fivefold cross-validation. Each ADMIXTURE analysis was repeated 10 times with different seeds, resulting in a total of 100 runs for each value of K. We then used CLUMPAK 38 to analyse the ADMIXTURE results and compute ancestry proportions (Supplementary Information 6.2). Average F ST values were computed using Hudson's estimator and the ratio of averages, and standard errors were computed using a block-jackknife 39 (Supplementary Information 6.4). AIMs were ascertained by starting with SNPs previously discovered in Mali 18 with an allele frequency difference between An. gambiae and An. coluzzii &gt; 0.9, then taking the intersection with biallelic SNPs discovered in this study, resulting in 506 AIMs (Supplementary Information 6.6). Population size history. We inferred the scale and timing of historical changes in N e using two methods, stairway plot 40 and ∂ a∂ i 41 , both using site frequency spectra but taking different modelling approaches. To compute site frequency spectra, we used SNPs from within the regions 3R: 1-37 Mb and 3L: 15-41 Mb, taking only intergenic SNPs at least 5 kb from the nearest gene (Supplementary Information 8). We modified the stairway plot to include an additional parameter representing the probability of ancestral misclassification for each SNP (Supplementary Information 8.1). We fitted a three-epoch (two N e changes) ∂ a∂ i model for each population singly, and fitted joint population models for selected pairs of populations (Supplementary Information 8.2). Scaling of parameters assumed that the Anopheles mutation rate is within the range of values estimated for Drosophila, in which estimates 42,43 range from 2.8 × 10 -9 to 5.5 × 10 -9 . For joint population models, we computed the joint site frequency spectrum for each pair of populations from the same set of SNPs used for single-population inferences. Joint population models allowed for a phase of exponential size change in the ancestral population up until the time of the population split, after which each of the daughter populations experienced their own exponential size change until the present. We fitted these models with and without the addition of a symmetric, bidirectional migration rate parameter following the split. To study recent population history in Kenya we used IBDseq 44 to infer genome tracts IBD, then ran the IBDNe program (http://faculty.washington.edu/browning/ibdne.html) 45 to infer population size history (Supplementary Information 8.4). Recent selection. To scan the genome for signals of recent selection, we computed the H12 haplotype diversity statistic 46 for each population, and the crosspopulation extended haplotype homozygosity (XP-EHH) score 47 for selected pairs of populations. H12 was computed in non-overlapping windows over the genome, in which each window contained a fixed number of SNPs, and window sizes were calibrated separately for each population to account for differences in the extent of linkage disequilibrium (Supplementary Information 9.1). XP-EHH was computed for all SNPs with a minor allele frequency ≥ 5% in the union of both populations in each pair, and normalized within each chromosome (Supplementary Information 9.2). To study haplotype structure at the Vgsc, Gste and Cyp6p loci, we computed the Hamming distance between all pairs of haplotypes, then performed hierarchical clustering of haplotypes (Supplementary Information 9.3). To identify haplotype clusters resulting from recent selection, we cut the dendrograms at a small genetic distance (0.0004 SNP differences per accessible base pair) and studied the largest clusters obtained after cutting. To look for evidence that the haplotype clusters we identified were related via recombination events, we performed the same clustering analysis but in non-overlapping windows upstream and downstream of the target region and compared the resulting clusters. Plotting and maps. All figures were produced using the matplotlib package for Python 48 . The map component of Fig. 2 was produced via the matplotlib basemap package, using the NASA Blue Marble image as the map background. The map components of Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 10 were plotted via the cartopy package, using the Natural Earth shaded relief raster as the map background. The map in Extended Data Fig. 1 was plotted via the cartopy package, using data from the map of standardized terrestrial ecosystems of Africa 49 as the map background.
