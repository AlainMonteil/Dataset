        <p>Following the first case reports in Hubei province, China, in late 2019, a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) was declared by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Although COVID-19 causes minimal or mild illness in most, a small but appreciable proportion of individuals require oxygen therapy and often admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). The ensuing unprecedented pressure on hospital wards and ICUs has necessitated rapid re-deployment of staff and capacity towards the management of COVID-19 cases with deprioritisation of non-emergency clinical services, including diagnostics and elective specialist surgery. Concurrently, lockdown of the population has impacted dramatically on presentation and referral of symptomatic patients from primary into secondary care. 1 For patients with cancer, delay of surgery has the real potential to increase the likelihood of metastatic disease, with some patients' tumours progressing from being curable (with near-normal life expectancy) to noncurable (with limited life expectancy). 2 The situation has been further exacerbated by recent safety concerns regarding aerosol generation from endoscopy, cystoscopy and surgery. 3,4 Current projections indicate that COVID-19-related disruption may well last for !18 months, until there is either long-term effective containment in the population or large-scale vaccination. To inform health care prioritisation and resource allocation, we have examined the impact on cancer outcomes of different periods of delay of cancer surgery with disruption extending over variable periods, comparing resource-weighted outcomes with hospital management of COVID-19 patients.Following the first case reports in Hubei province, China, in late 2019, a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) was declared by the World Health Organization in March 2020.

        <p>Number and age-specific 5-year net survival of cancer patients that had potentially curative surgical resections for nonhematological malignancies between 2013 and 2017 were obtained from the Public Health England National Cancer Registration Service. 5 As well as cancer stage at diagnosis for each cancer type, breast tumour receptor data allowed subtyping of these cancers as ERþ HER2À, HERþ (any), ERÀ HER2À and other. Estimates for nosocomial infection rates, median duration of hospital stay for each cancer type, staffing of theatres, ICU and surgical wards were based on information from three large UK surgical oncology centres. Patterns of administration of adjuvant systemic anticancer therapy (SACT) were based on oncologistreviewed standard practice guidance. 6 ICU COVID-19 mortality, distribution by age and duration of stay and proportion referred into ICU were obtained from ICNARC (Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre) and data from hospitalised UK cases. 7,8 Because of lack of UK data, data from Wuhan were used as the basis for the age distribution of community infection, age-specific likelihoods of admission from community to hospital and case fatality rates for non-ICU COVID-19 patients 9,10 (see supplementary Table S1, available at Annals of Oncology online).Number and age-specific 5-year net survival of cancer patients that had potentially curative surgical resections for nonhematological malignancies between 2013 and 2017 were obtained from the Public Health England National Cancer Registration Service. 5 As well as cancer stage at diagnosis for each cancer type, breast tumour receptor data allowed subtyping of these cancers as ERþ HER2À, HERþ (any), ERÀ HER2À and other.

        <p>Impact of COVID-associated delay on cancer outcomes. We used published data from studies examining the impact on overall survival from delay in cancer surgery to estimate perday hazard ratios (HRs) associated with delay for different cancers (the 'Fatality HR'). 11e21 We had sufficient data to generate Fatality HRs for three tumour types and assigned these to other tumours, based on comparability of 5-year survival as low (&gt;90%), moderate (50%e90%) or high (&lt;50%) progressiveness tumours. 5 Because we were unable to identify any suitable observational data for tumours of high progressiveness (e.g. oesophageal, gastric), we applied the Fatality HR from tumours of moderate progressiveness; this is likely to be a conservative assumption (supplementary Table S2, available at Annals of Oncology online).Impact of COVID-associated delay on cancer outcomes.

        <p>By accounting for COVID-related postsurgical mortality and changes in SACT, we adjusted 5-year net survival figures for each cancer for surgical patients under 'standard' care to estimate 'current' 5-year net survival. To model outcomes of surgery 'post-delay', we apply to standard 5-year net survival the Fatality HR relating to the specified number of days of delay, again including COVID-related postsurgical mortality. Based on estimates from a UK surgical oncology centre, supported by the literature, we applied a current per-day rate of nosocomial infection of 5%. Assuming improvement in cold protocols, we modelled reduction in this rate over time. We estimated COVID-associated surgical mortality based on per-day rate of nosocomial infection, operation-specific duration of postsurgical admission and age-specific mortality from infection. We estimated COVID-19-associated mortality for SACT administration, based on per-day rate of nosocomial infection, the frequency of SACT scheduling, increased risk associated with immunosuppression and age-specific mortality from infection. We assumed, where standard of care, that SACT offers a uniform survival benefit (5% in stage 1, 7.5% in stage 2 and 10% in stage 3) and administration would only continue where this benefit exceeds COVID-related mortality.By accounting for COVID-related postsurgical mortality and changes in SACT, we adjusted 5-year net survival figures for each cancer for surgical patients under 'standard' care to estimate 'current' 5-year net survival.

        <p>We used mean life expectancies per 10-year age group to calculate life-years gained (LYGs), averaged per patient. We examined reduction in overall survival and LYGs, comparing surgery under standard care, current conditions and postdelay, by cancer type and by age and stage. Using 2013e 2017 surgical workload data, we calculated, across all adult cancers examined, the total number of deaths and life-years lost attributable to delay. To address possible scenarios, we considered per-patient delay of up to 6 months, and 1-and 2-year periods of disruption.We used mean life expectancies per 10-year age group to calculate life-years gained (LYGs), averaged per patient.

        <p>Resource. We analysed health care resource units (HCRUs) focused specifically on frontline medical and nursing staff, where one HCRU is one 12-hour shift of direct nursing or medical care. We upweighted for shifts from health care workers of high salary (senior doctors) and/or of current scarcity (anaesthetists, ICU nurses). We calculated HCRUs per patient using estimated staffing ratios for theatres, ICU and ward care and operation-specific data for theatre hours, ICU stay and ward days from oncology centres.Resource.

        <p>The greatest rates of deaths arise following even modest delays to surgery in aggressive cancers, with &gt;30% reduction in survival at 6 months and &gt;17% reduction in survival at 3 months for patients with stage 2 or 3 cancers of the bladder, lung, oesophagus, ovary, liver, pancreas and stomach (Table 2; see also supplementary Table S3 and supplementary Materials, available at Annals of Oncology online). Accounting for nosocomial COVID-19 infection, for cancers with a relatively good overall prognosis, delay of surgery by 3 months had a minimal impact on survival: &lt;1% for all stage 1 ERþ and HER2þ breast cancers, for example. In older patients (aged &gt;70), for early stage colorectal, kidney and ERþ breast cancers, the current impact on survival of COVID-related mortality exceeded the impact of 3 or even 6 months' delay (Table 2; see also supplementary Table S3, available at Annals of Oncology online).The greatest rates of deaths arise following even modest delays to surgery in aggressive cancers, with &gt;30% reduction in survival at 6 months and &gt;17% reduction in survival at 3 months for patients with stage 2 or 3 cancers of the bladder, lung, oesophagus, ovary, liver, pancreas and stomach (Table 2; see also supplementary Table S3 and supplementary Materials, available at Annals of Oncology online).

        <p>For a high proportion of solid cancers, survival at 5 years is generally considered to be equivalent to cure. Predicated on this assertion, we considered LYGs adjusting for resource [resource-adjusted life-years gained (RALYGs)]. Perhaps unsurprisingly, most benefit is afforded in younger age groups for operations that are shorter with no associated ICU requirement. For example, trans-urethral resection of stage 1 bladder cancers affords on average 23.4 RALYGs per patient aged 30e39, whereas cystectomy for stage 2 bladder cancer is only associated with 1.2 RALYGs in that age group (supplementary Table S4, available at Annals of Oncology online). In the context of prioritisation, avoidance of a 6-month delay restitutes on average 4.1 RALYGs in the former group, compared with 0.7 in the latter (Table 3; see also supplementary Table S5, available at Annals of Oncology online). Wide local excision for breast cancer has low resource requirement and therefore confers substantial RALYGs, even in good prognosis subtypes.For a high proportion of solid cancers, survival at 5 years is generally considered to be equivalent to cure.

        <p>Each year, 94 912 surgical resections for common invasive adult cancer types are performed in England, with 80 406 of those patients surviving their cancer at 5 years.

        <p>For a high proportion of solid cancers, 5-year survival is generally considered to be equivalent to cure. Predicated on this assertion, across all cancers a treatment delay of 3 months would lead to a reduction of 92 214 life-years, whereas a treatment delay of 6 months would lead to a reduction of 208 275 life-years (Table 3). Prior to the COVID-19 crisis, each year cancer surgery was directly responsible for 1 717 051 LYGs. This represents on average 18.1 LYG per patient, which reduces to 17.1 with 3 months' delay and to 15.9 with 6 months' delay. Cancer surgery per year requires 764 765 units of health care resource. Assuming this to be unchanged by delay, this affords on average 2.25 RALYGs per patient under standard conditions, reducing to 2.12 with 3 months' delay and 1.97 with 6 months' delay, an average loss of 0.12 and 0.27 RALYGs, respectively, per patient.For a high proportion of solid cancers, 5-year survival is generally considered to be equivalent to cure.

        <p>For contextualisation, we compare the impact of cancer surgery delay with hospital care for patients with communityacquired COVID-19 infection.

        <p>For aggressive cancers, our analysis demonstrates that even short delays (3 months) have a significant impact on patient survival. However, even for cancers of comparatively favourable prognosis, a delay of 6 months will result in significant summed attributable deaths as many of these cancers are common. Delay will also result in tumours being more advanced, meaning not only is survival poorer, but also the upstaged cancers will be more costly to treat in terms of both surgery and/or chemotherapy. Furthermore, resource requirements (e.g. ICU stay) are dramatically higher for the many who will inevitably present as emergencies such as with obstruction, perforation or acute bleeding of the gastrointestinal tract. 22 Critical to mitigating cancer deaths is recognition that delay or bottleneck may arise at any point in the linear patient journey from (i) self-presentation of the symptomatic patient to primary care, (ii) primary care review and referral into secondary care (iii) diagnostic investigation, and (iv) surgery (or radiotherapy) with curative intent. Alongside any 'bulge' in accumulated cases will be the normal stream of incident cancer presentations. In the face of prolonged stress, it will be challenging to provide extra capacity to address these bulges alongside standard demands. In the short term, to avoid knock-on delays, immediate diversion of supra-normal resource volumes are required to process the backlog of cases that will have accrued in the initial months of the pandemic, in which referrals, investigations and surgeries have been reduced by up to 80%. 1 In the medium-to-long term (over the next 3e24 months), avoidance of delay in cancer surgery should be of the highest priority: urgent attention is required to ensure sufficient resourcing for standard capacity of all pathway elements in primary care, cancer diagnostic and surgical.For aggressive cancers, our analysis demonstrates that even short delays (3 months) have a significant impact on patient survival.

        <p>Delay in cancer surgery will have a highly deleterious health and economic impact. For the most part, the surgery will still be required (and may be more complex and costly) but results in rapid diminution of resultant LYGs and resource-adjusted life-years. Comparing equivalent-sized hospital populations adjusted for resource, the health impact of delaying cancer surgery for 6 months will approximate 60% of health gains of hospitalisations for community-acquired COVID-19 infection. We need to consider resourcing in the likely event of sizeable requirement for COVID-19 management for a sustained period, potentially up to 2 years. Although large facilities may be built/repurposed for COVID-19 management, these facilities are competing for the same fixed pool of health care workers that care for non-COVID-19 patients.Delay in cancer surgery will have a highly deleterious health and economic impact.

        <p>Where the rate of nosocomial infection is high, for older groups in particular, surgery and/or SACT may in the short-term offer more risk than benefit (see supplementary Materials, available at Annals of Oncology online). Active focus is required to establish 'cold' sections of the health care system, with rigorous protocols for staff screening and shielding protocols. This will serve to minimise nosocomial acquisition and mortality from COVID-19, to protect staff and also to provide reassurance to the public regarding uptake of diagnostics and surgery for cancer.Where the rate of nosocomial infection is high, for older groups in particular, surgery and/or SACT may in the short-term offer more risk than benefit (see supplementary Materials, available at Annals of Oncology online).

        <p>Given an accrued backlog of cases and ongoing tight competition for resources, decisions regarding surgical prioritisation may be required for a number of years, with capacity varying geographically and temporally. Recognising its limitations regarding assumptions and parameters, we propose a model that provides a rational approach by which to evaluate across patients of different ages, tumour types and stages the benefit and resource implications of their cancer surgery. We highlight in our model those age-stage groups for which COVID-related mortality currently exceeds survival benefit for surgery and/or SACT. Although these and other groups for which benefit is marginal will be the most rationale to delay, they will nevertheless require monitoring and surgery downstream. Longitudinal planning, monitoring of progression, dynamic re-prioritisation and capacity planning will inevitably be highly challenging.Given an accrued backlog of cases and ongoing tight competition for resources, decisions regarding surgical prioritisation may be required for a number of years, with capacity varying geographically and temporally.

        <p>Although we have used data for England, cancer survival is broadly similar across most economically developed countries, so the impact of delay per tumour is broadly applicable across Europe. However, variations in incidence of cancer, life expectancy and population age structure mean that predictions regarding total case numbers and LYGs and life-years lost are more difficult to extrapolate, even when scaling for relative size of reference population.Although we have used data for England, cancer survival is broadly similar across most economically developed countries, so the impact of delay per tumour is broadly applicable across Europe.

        <p>As with any model-based analysis, our predictions are predicated on the validity of assumptions and estimates used for parameterisation. While we have made use of observational data, our approach simplifies the complexity of cancer progression and is solely survival focused. For health care planning, a more elaborate model capturing stage shifting may offer additional utility. We base our analysis on survival data from 2013 to 2017; for some tumour types, standard of care and survival have evolved since this time. Our modelling of the benefit of SACT is simplistic as the scheduling, benefits and immunosuppressive consequences vary by chemotherapy regimen. While we have included in our model the impact of withholding SACT if nosocomial infection risk is high, we have not modelled additional reduction in survival from delays in administration of adjuvant therapy. Mortality from nosocomial COVID-19 infection during surgical admission or attendance for chemotherapy is based on a uniform per-day risk of infection: these are simplistic and will vary dramatically in time ans space. While our resourcing analysis deliberately focuses on the requirement for the direct medical and nursing staff who most limit health care provision, we acknowledge it does not capture other 'costs' incurred in hospital care, primary care and social care.As with any model-based analysis, our predictions are predicated on the validity of assumptions and estimates used for parameterisation.

        <p>Our model of COVID-19 admissions is limited by availability of detailed individual-level UK data, in particular for non-CCU hospital admissions; this model is also conservative insofar as it disregards impact of comorbidities on life expectancy for hospitalised COVID-19 patients of comorbidities on life expectancy.Our model of COVID-19 admissions is limited by availability of detailed individual-level UK data, in particular for non-CCU hospital admissions; this model is also conservative insofar as it disregards impact of comorbidities on life expectancy for hospitalised COVID-19 patients of comorbidities on life expectancy.</p>
        <p>Within our current approach, we only estimate the effects of a specified period of per-patient delay. Contemporaneous data for NHS (National Health Service) activity offer the prospect of developing dynamic models to predict the impact of (i) differential prioritisation of patient groups, (ii) different patterns of re-presentation of 'accumulated' cases alongside incident cases, and (iii) varying release of bottlenecks in primary care, diagnostics and surgery. Evaluation is also important for the alternative management approaches being adopted, such as radiotherapy with curative intent where surgery is gold standard or a priori hormonal treatment for prostate and ERþ breast cancers. For any strategies involving deliberate delay to surgery, models including re-staging focused on the impact to surgery with curative intent; analyses are also required to quantify the impact on mortality of changes to life-extending chemotherapy and radiotherapy for patients with stage 4 disease.Within our current approach, we only estimate the effects of a specified period of per-patient delay.

        <p>Compared with COVID-19 management, cancer surgery is highly impactful in regard to LYGs per resource expended. Delays in diagnosis and surgery cause exponential burden of attributable mortality. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented strain on health care provision. It is highly plausible that surges of population infection, lockdowns, resource competition, bottlenecks and back logs could recur over the next 2 years. Supra-normal capacity is required to manage backlogs of accumulated cancer cases alongside ongoing incident cases. To avoid a deferred public health crisis of unnecessary cancer deaths, urgent ringfencing of substantial resources is required.Compared with COVID-19 management, cancer surgery is highly impactful in regard to LYGs per resource expended.
