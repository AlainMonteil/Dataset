        <p>Background: In humans, many diseases are associated with the accumulation of free radicals. Antioxidants can scavenge free radicals and minimize their impact. Therefore, the search for naturally occurring antioxidants of plant origin is imperative. Here, we aimed to investigate the antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties of methanolic extracts from Tabebuia pallida (T. pallida) stem bark (TPSB), root bark (TPRB), leaves (TPL), and flowers (TPF).Background: In humans, many diseases are associated with the accumulation of free radicals.

        <p>Results: Among the extracts, TPL showed the highest total antioxidant capacity followed by TPRB, TPF, and TPSB. Based on DPPH and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, TPL showed strong scavenging activity (91.05 ± 1.10 and 62.00 ± 0.57) with IC 50 of 9.20 ± 0.28 and 46.00 ± 2.84 μg/mL, respectively when compared with standard BHT (IC 50 of 7.00 ± 0.25 μg/mL) and CA (75.00 ± 0.14 μg/mL). These results suggest that TPL had the highest radical scavenging activity among the extractives that closely resembled the standard's. In lipid peroxidation inhibition assay, TPL exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity (83.18 ± 2.12 %) with IC 50 of 12.00 ± 2.12 μg/mL, which closely resembled standard CA (IC 50 of 10.50 ± 0.28 μg/mL). Also, the reducing capacity on ferrous ion was in the following order: TPL &gt; TPRB &gt; TF &gt; TPSB. The phenolic and flavonoid contents of TPL were higher than other extractives. A positive correlation (p value &lt;0.001) was observed between phenolic content and free radical (DPPH • and • OH) scavenging efficiencies and lipid peroxidation inhibition activity.Results: Among the extracts, TPL showed the highest total antioxidant capacity followed by TPRB, TPF, and TPSB.

        <p>There is strong evidence that many dangerous pathophysiological processes, such as cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, are associated with the accumulation of free radicals [1][2][3]. A free radical is an atom or molecule that has an unpaired electron and is therefore unstable. This unstable radical has the tendency to become stable through electron pairing with biological macromolecules such as proteins, lipids, and DNA in healthy human cells, thus causing protein and DNA damage [1]. Such radical-caused cell damage can become more widespread due to weakened cellular antioxidant defense systems. All biological systems have innate antioxidant defense mechanisms that remove damaged molecules, but these mechanisms can be inefficient. Therefore dietary intake of antioxidants is imperative to protect cells from damage caused by free radicals.There is strong evidence that many dangerous pathophysiological processes, such as cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, are associated with the accumulation of free radicals [1][2][3].

        <p>Antioxidants are substances that prevent and stabilize the damage caused by free radicals by supplying electrons from antioxidants to these damage cells. Antioxidants also turn free radicals into waste by-products, which are eliminated from the body. Consumption of antioxidantenriched fruits and vegetables is known to lower the risk of several diseases caused by free radicals [4]. Such health benefits are mainly due to the presence of phytochemicals such as polyphenols, carotenoids, and vitamin E and C [5]. Although phenolic compounds are commonly found in both edible and in non edible herbs, cereals, fruits, vegetables, oils, spices, and other plant materials [6,7], scientific information on the antioxidant properties of endemic plants is scare because the availability of endemic plants is limited to certain regions and only known by local populations. Therefore, the assessment of such properties remains an interesting and useful task, particularly to find promising sources of natural antioxidants for functional foods and/or nutraceuticals [7,8].Antioxidants are substances that prevent and stabilize the damage caused by free radicals by supplying electrons from antioxidants to these damage cells.

        <p>Tabebuia palllida (commonly known as White trumpet tree), is one of the largest genera of the Bignoniaceae family distributed in central America, West India, and South America [9,10]. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work investigating the phytochemical composition and biological activities of T. palllida. Therefore, we performed a detailed literature review of the Tabebuia genus. We found that Tabebuia has a variety of biological activities [9] and is recognized as a therapeutic alternative by rural or remote populations for the treatment of different diseases. Tabebuia rosea is used as an antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-cancer, and anti-diabetic agent [10][11][12][13][14][15]. Stem bark of T. avellanedae is used in the treatment of snake bites [10,16]. Also, T. heterophylla, T. aurea, T. argentea and T. caraiba are used as anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial agents [9,17].Tabebuia palllida (commonly known as White trumpet tree), is one of the largest genera of the Bignoniaceae family distributed in central America, West India, and South America [9,10].

        <p>Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of samples was determined by the method reported by Prieto et al. [21]. The assay is based on the reduction of Mo(VI) to Mo(V) by samples and formation of green colored phosphate/ Mo(V) complex at acidic pH. 0.5 mL of samples/standard at different concentrations (12.5-150 μg/mL) was mixed with 3 mL of reaction mixture containing 0.6 M sulphuric acid, 28 mM sodium phosphate and 1 % ammonium molybdate into the test tubes. The test tubes were incubated at 95 °C for 10 min to complete the reaction. After cooling at RT, sample absorbance was measured at 695 nm using a spectrophotometer against a blank solution. CA was used as standard. A typical blank solution contained 3 mL of reaction mixture and the appropriate volume of the same solvent used for the samples/standard. The blank was incubated at 95 °C for 10 min and the absorbance was measured at 695 nm. Increased absorbance of the reaction mixture indicates increased total antioxidant capacity. We used standard/samples at five different concentrations ranges from 12.5 to 150 μg/mL for each antioxidant assay. Concentrations were selected on the basis of trial and error to fit the range of concentration that can fully represent the rational change of antioxidant activity with the increasing concentration of the samples.

        <p>Free radical scavenging ability of the extracts was tested by DPPH radical scavenging assay as described by Blois [23] and Desmarchelier et al. [24]. The hydrogen atom donating ability of the plant extractives was determined by the decolorization of methanol solution of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). DPPH produces violet/ purple color in methanol solution and fades to shades of yellow color in the presence of antioxidants. A solution of 0.1 mM DPPH in methanol was prepared, and 2.4 mL of this solution was mixed with 1.6 mL of extract in methanol at different concentrations (12.5-150 μg/mL). The reaction mixture was vortexed thoroughly and left in the dark at RT for 30 min. The absorbance of the mixture was measured spectrophotometrically at 517 nm. BHT was used as reference. Percentage DPPH radical scavenging activity was calculated by the following equation: where A 0 is the absorbance of the control, and A 1 is the absorbance of the extractives/standard. Then % of inhibition was plotted against concentration, and from the graph IC 50 was calculated.

        <p>The lipid peroxidation inhibition assay was determined according to the method described by Haenen and Bast [26]. Protocol used in this study for the use of rat as animal model for lipid peroxidation inhibition assay was approved by the Institutional Animal, Medical Ethics, Biosafety and Biosecurity Committee (IAMEBBC) for Experimentations on Animal, Human, Microbes and Living Natural Sources (225/320-IAMEBBC/IBSc), Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Rajshahi, Bangladesh. Excised rat liver was homogenized in buffer and then centrifuged to obtain liposome. To make 10 % liver homogenate, excised Wister rat liver (weight of ~150 g) was minced using glass Teflon homogenizer in ice cold phosphate buffered saline (50 mm, pH 7.4). The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used as liposome for in vitro lipid peroxidation assay.

The time factor associated with their chemical reactions to produce free radicals by oxidation reaction also different from each other. Since the procedure and experimental conditions are different for different techniques, the various antioxidants are considered as a control for different assay techniques according to their rate and time of scavenging. In addition, antioxidants could be polar e.g. phenolics, flavanoids etc. or non-polar e.g. vitamin E in nature and they can act as radical scavenger by electron donating mechanism or by hydrogen donating mechanism.

        <p>The antioxidant potential of the different parts of methanolic extracts of TPL, TPRB, TPSB, and TPF of T. pallida was estimated from their ability to reduce the reduction of Mo (VI) to Mo (V) by the antioxidant-enriched fractions and subsequent formation of a green phosphate/Mo (V) complex at acidic pH. Antioxidant activity depends on the presence of its bio-active compounds mainly polyphenols, carotenoids, and vitamin E and C (27). This suggests that the concentration of the bioactive compounds present in the extract is important to showing antioxidant activity. Thus, higher concentration of extracts shows higher antioxidant activity. In this study, the reducing ability of the extractives was in the range of 0.648 ± 0.030-1.625 ± 0.010 μm green phosphate/ Mo (V). All the extracts showed a good total antioxidant activity that increased with increasing concentration (Table 1). Our results comply with the data published elsewhere [27] and suggest that the antioxidant capacity can be attributed to the extractive's chemical composition and polyphenol contents.The antioxidant potential of the different parts of methanolic extracts of TPL, TPRB, TPSB, and TPF of T. pallida was estimated from their ability to reduce the reduction of Mo (VI) to Mo (V) by the antioxidant-enriched fractions and subsequent formation of a green phosphate/Mo (V) complex at acidic pH.

        <p>Reducing power is also widely used in evaluating antioxidant activity of plant polyphenols. The reducing power is generally associated with the presence of reductants, which exert antioxidant action by breaking the free radical chains by donating a hydrogen atom. In this assay, the presence of reductants in the antioxidant sample reduces Fe 3+ /ferricyanide complex to the Fe 2+ / ferrous form. Thus, the reducing power of the sample can be monitored by measuring the formation of Perl's Prussian blue at 700 nm [27]. In this study, the iron reducing capacity of the methanolic extracts of TPL, TPRB, TPSB, and TPF was estimated from their ability to reduce the Fe 3+ -ferricyanide complex to the ferrous form by donating an electron. The reducing ability of the extracts was in the range of 0.484 ± 0.028-2.914 ± 0.100 μm Fe(II)/g (Table 1). All the extracts showed a good reducing power capacity, which was concentration-dependent (Table 1). Our results are consistent with the data published previously [28].

        <p>The effect of antioxidants on DPPH is thought to be due to their hydrogen donating ability [29]. Radical scavenging activities are very important to prevent the deleterious role of free radicals in different diseases, including cancer. DPPH free radical scavenging is an accepted mechanism for screening the antioxidant activity of plant extracts. In the DPPH assay, violet color DPPH solution is reduced to yellow colored product, diphenylpicryl hydrazine, by the addition of the extract in a concentration dependent manner. This method has been used extensively to predict antioxidant activities because of the relatively short time required for analysis. Our results revealed that the methanolic extract of TPL had a similar free radical scavenging activity when compared with standard BHT (Fig. 1). Polyphenol contents and tocopherols scavenge the DPPH radicals by their hydrogen donating ability [28,29]. The results obtained in this study suggest that all the extracts from T. pallida showed radical scavenging activity by their electron transfer or hydrogen donating ability.

        <p>The mutagenic capacity of free radicals is due to the direct interactions of hydroxyl radicals with DNA, resulting in DNA breakdown and therefore playing an important role in cancer formation [30]. Hydroxyl radicals are formed by incubating Fe +3 -EDTA premixture with ascorbic acid and H 2 O 2 at pH 7.4, causing 2-deoxyd-ribose degradation and generating a malondialdehyde (MDA)-like product. Addition of the methanolic extractives of TPL, TPRB, TPSB, and TPF to the reaction mixture removes hydroxyl radicals and prevents further damage. The extractives showed appreciable hydroxyl radical scavenging activity when compared with standard antioxidant, CA (Fig. 2), and could be served as anticancer agents by inhibiting the interaction of hydroxyl radicals with DNA. The ability of the extractives to quench hydroxyl radicals might directly relate to the prevention of lipid peroxidation.The mutagenic capacity of free radicals is due to the direct interactions of hydroxyl radicals with DNA, resulting in DNA breakdown and therefore playing an important role in cancer formation [30].

        <p>Reactive oxygen species induce membrane damage by peroxiding lipid moieties, particularly the polyunsaturated fatty acids in a chain reaction known as lipid peroxidation [31]. The initial reaction generates a second radical, which can further react with a second macromolecule, generating chain reaction and causing cellular abnormalities. In vitro lipid peroxidation was induced in rat liver by ferric ion plus potassium chloride through OH radical generation by Fenton's reaction. The inhibition of lipid peroxidation is considered the most important index of antioxidant activity. Here, lipid peroxidation inhibition activity of TPL was higher than other extractives (Fig. 3). These results indicated that T. pallida can prevent cellular abnormalities caused by free radicals by breaking down the chain reactions responsible for lipid peroxidation. Thus, T. pallida is a good source of natural antioxidants and may be used to treat several diseases caused by free radicals.Reactive oxygen species induce membrane damage by peroxiding lipid moieties, particularly the polyunsaturated fatty acids in a chain reaction known as lipid peroxidation [31].

        <p>Biologically active pure compound is better than crude extract. However, to get the overall view regarding the phytochemical composition and biological activities of any plant, it is important to pick the most potential part by investigating several parts (leaf, stem bark, root bark, fruits, flowers etc.) of that plant. Here, we examined different parts (root bark, stem bark, leaf and flower) of T. pallida and found that methanolic extract of T. pallida leaf, which contains large amounts of phenolic and flavonoid compounds, exhibited the highest antioxidant and free radical scavenging and also inhibited lipid peroxidation. A positive correlation (p-value &lt;0.001) was observed between phenolic content and free radical (DPPH • and • OH) scavenging efficiencies and lipid peroxidation inhibition activity. These in vitro assays indicate that T. pallida leaves are a significant source of natural antioxidants, which could help to prevent the progression of various diseases caused by free radicals, such as certain cancers. However, the components responsible for the antioxidative activity are currently unclear. Therefore, further investigation is needed to isolate and identify the antioxidant compounds present in the plant extract.Biologically active pure compound is better than crude extract.
