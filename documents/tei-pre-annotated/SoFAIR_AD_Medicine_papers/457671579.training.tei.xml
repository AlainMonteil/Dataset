        <p>Background Ovarian cancer continues to have a poor prognosis with the majority of women diagnosed with advanced disease. Therefore, we undertook the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) to determine if population screening can reduce deaths due to the disease. We report on ovarian cancer mortality after long-term follow-up in UKCTOCS.Background Ovarian cancer continues to have a poor prognosis with the majority of women diagnosed with advanced disease.

        <p>In this randomised controlled trial, postmenopausal women aged 50-74 years were recruited from 13 centres in National Health Service trusts in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Exclusion criteria were bilateral oophorectomy, previous ovarian or active non-ovarian malignancy, or increased familial ovarian cancer risk. The trial management system confirmed eligibility and randomly allocated participants in blocks of 32 using computer generated random numbers to annual multimodal screening (MMS), annual transvaginal ultrasound screening (USS), or no screening, in a 1:1:2 ratio. Follow-up was through national registries. The primary outcome was death due to ovarian or tubal cancer (WHO 2014 criteria) by June 30, 2020. Analyses were by intention to screen, comparing MMS and USS separately with no screening using the versatile test. Investigators and participants were aware of screening type, whereas the outcomes review committee were masked to randomisation group. This study is registered with ISRCTN, 22488978, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00058032.In this randomised controlled trial, postmenopausal women aged 50-74 years were recruited from 13 centres in National Health Service trusts in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

        <p>Ovarian cancer remains the most deadly of all gynaecological cancers. Most patients (58%) are diagnosed at an advanced stage (III or IV), which is associated with poor survival (5-year survival is 27% for stage III and 13% for stage IV ovarian cancer). 1 The greater than 90% survival rates in women detected at stage I 1 has spurred international efforts in early detection, spanning across four decades. [2][3][4][5][6] All trials have used combinations of the biomarker CA125 and pelvic imaging using transvaginal ultrasound scans (TVS). Despite these extensive endeavours, to date there is no evidence that screening for ovarian cancer saves lives. [7][8][9] In our multicentre randomised trial (UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening [UKCTOCS]), 202 638 women from the general population were randomly assigned to two annual screening groupsmultimodal screening (MMS; longitudinal CA125 and second line TVS) and ultrasound screening (USS; TVS first and second-line test), and a no screening group. We reported previously (median follow-up of 11•1 years), that an absolute proportion of 13% more women with ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancer were diagnosed with stage I or II disease in the MMS group than in the no screening group. There was no change in stage in the USS group. There was no evidence of a reduction in disease-specific deaths in either screened group compared with the no screening group using the Cox version of the log-rank test. The observed reduction in deaths was delayed and the cumulative mortality curves appeared to be diverging at the time of previous reporting. 9 Therefore, we aimed to continue follow-up and report here on the longterm mortality effects of ovarian cancer screening in UKCTOCS.Ovarian cancer remains the most deadly of all gynaecological cancers.

        <p>We did a randomised controlled trial (UKCTOCS) of postmenopausal women aged 50-74 years from the general population recruited through 13 centres in National Health Service (NHS) Trusts in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland with use of age-sex registers of 27 primary care trusts. 10 We commissioned specialised software from the NHS to randomly select women aged 50-74 years and then flag them on primary care trusts' registers and allow electronic transfer of their personal and general practice details. We then sent women personal invitations and logged replies on the trial management system. Women attended a recruitment clinic at the regional centre where they viewed an information video, completed a recruitment questionnaire, and provided written consent and a baseline serum sample. We scanned recruitment questionnaires at the coordinating centre into a bespoke trial management system.We did a randomised controlled trial (UKCTOCS) of postmenopausal women aged 50-74 years from the general population recruited through 13 centres in National Health Service (NHS) Trusts in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland with use of age-sex registers of 27 primary care trusts. 10 We commissioned specialised software from the NHS to randomly select women aged 50-74 years and then flag them on primary care trusts' registers and allow electronic transfer of their personal and general practice details.

        <p>Evidence before this study We searched PubMed from Jan 1, 2015, to Dec 31, 2020, with no language restrictions for randomised controlled trials for ovarian cancer screening that reported mortality data. The following keywords were used to search the database: "ovarian cancer" AND "randomised controlled trial" AND "screening" AND "mortality". We found two relevant publications. In the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS; n=202 638), at a median follow-up of 11•1 years, no significant reduction in deaths from ovarian cancer was seen in either of the screen groups (multimodal or ultrasound) compared with the no screening group. A reduction in deaths was seen but was delayed and only apparent after about 7 years. There was a suggestion that 15% fewer women in the multimodal screening group and 11% fewer in the ultrasound screening group died from ovarian cancer compared with the no screening group. Additionally, a significantly greater proportion (13%) of women with ovarian cancers in the multimodal group but not in the ultrasound group were found at an earlier stage (stage I and II) compared with the no screening group. As the data did not definitively answer the question of whether screening saved lives, follow-up was continued to gather more evidence. The Ovarian Cancer Screening arm of the Prostate Lung Colorectal Ovarian (PLCO) cancer trial in the USA is the only other large randomised controlled trial (n=78 216) to explore mortality benefit. Following extended follow-up (median 14•7 years), the trial confirmed previous findings of no ovarian cancer mortality reduction between the screen and control arms.Evidence before this study We searched PubMed from Jan 1, 2015, to Dec 31, 2020, with no language restrictions for randomised controlled trials for ovarian cancer screening that reported mortality data.

        <p>Long-term follow-up (median follow-up &gt;16 years after recruitment) in the largest ovarian cancer screening trial, to our knowledge, provides definitive new evidence that neither screening approaches used in UKCTOCS reduced deaths from ovarian cancer, compared with no screening. This result was despite a 47•2% increase in incidence of women with ovarian and tubal cancer diagnosed at stage I and 24•5% decrease in those diagnosed with stage IV disease in the multimodal group compared with the no screening group. Importantly, however, there was only a 10•2% decrease in overall incidence of stage III or IV disease.Long-term follow-up (median follow-up &gt;16 years after recruitment) in the largest ovarian cancer screening trial, to our knowledge, provides definitive new evidence that neither screening approaches used in UKCTOCS reduced deaths from ovarian cancer, compared with no screening.

        <p>General population screening for ovarian and tubal cancer with either approach used in UKCTOCS cannot currently be recommended. We need a screening strategy that can detect ovarian and tubal cancer in asymptomatic women even earlier in its course and in a larger proportion of women than the tests used in the trial. Meanwhile, our results emphasise the importance of having ovarian and tubal cancer mortality as the primary outcome in screening trials.General population screening for ovarian and tubal cancer with either approach used in UKCTOCS cannot currently be recommended.

        <p>Annual screening in the MMS group used serum CA125 measurements, with the pattern over time interpreted using the risk of ovarian cancer (ROCA) calculation, 13 which identifies significant rises in CA125 concentration above baseline. On the basis of risk, women were triaged to normal (annual screening), intermediate (repeat CA125 ROCA test in 3 months), and elevated (repeat CA125 ROCA test and transvaginal USS as a second-line test in 6 weeks) risk. Annual screening in the USS group used TVS as the primary test, which was classified as normal (annual screening), unsatisfactory (repeat in 3 months), or abnormal (scan with a senior ultrasonographer within 6 weeks). In both groups, women with persistent abnormalities were assessed by a trial clinician and referred to the NHS where they underwent further investigation or surgery. We deemed women who had surgery or a biopsy for suspected ovarian cancer after clinical assessment as screen positive.Annual screening in the MMS group used serum CA125 measurements, with the pattern over time interpreted using the risk of ovarian cancer (ROCA) calculation, 13 which identifies significant rises in CA125 concentration above baseline.

        <p>Throughout the trial, we interrogated the available sources to identify women diagnosed with any of 19 International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes for possible ovarian or tubal cancer and retrieved copies of medical notes. 12,14 The only exception was women with malignant neoplasm without specification of site (ICD-10 C80), who also had another non-ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer registration. Medical notes, with any mention of randomisation group redacted, were reviewed by the outcomes review committee consisting of gynaecological pathologists and onco logists (NS, RM, RW, RA, LC, AS, and KW). The outcomes review committee assigned cancer site (ie, whether ovarian, tubal, or other site using a previously audited prespecified algorithm), 14 Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2014 stage, grade, morphology, ovarian cancer type, and cause of death. We defined ovarian and tubal cancer using the WHO 2014 classi fication 15,16 and death due to ovarian and tubal cancer based on disease progression (new or increases in size of previously documented lesions on imaging, clinical worsening, or rising biomarker concentrations). In the WHO 2014 classification, the definition for primary peritoneal cancers was revised. The outcomes review committee chair (NS) reviewed all 41 cancers previously classified as primary peritoneal as per WHO 2003 classification. 9 The outcomes review committee re-staged all ovarian and tubal cancers using FIGO 2014 criteria (previously staged using FIGO 2003) diagnosed in 2001-14.Throughout the trial, we interrogated the available sources to identify women diagnosed with any of 19 International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes for possible ovarian or tubal cancer and retrieved copies of medical notes. 12,14 The only exception was women with malignant neoplasm without specification of site (ICD-10 C80), who also had another non-ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer registration.

        <p>The primary outcome was death due to ovarian (ICD-10 C56) or tubal (ICD-10 C57•0) cancer. Ovarian cancer includes primary non-epithelial ovarian cancer, border line epithelial ovarian cancer, and invasive epithelial ovarian cancer. As stated above, ovarian cancer was defined using the revised WHO 2014 definition. 15,16 The site assignment is in contrast to the previous mortality analysis (censorship Dec 31, 2014), which used the WHO 2003 definition. 17 The majority (40 of 41) of previously classified primary peritoneal cancers using WHO 2003 criteria were reclassified as ovarian or tubal cancers. Secondary outcomes were ovarian and tubal cancer incidence and stage. For all outcomes, subgroup analysis was undertaken for invasive epithelial ovarian and tubal cancer. All outcome data were kept confidential until unmasking. Case fatality rate by stage was a posthoc outcome.The primary outcome was death due to ovarian (ICD-10 C56) or tubal (ICD-10 C57•0) cancer.

        <p>At previous analysis (censorship Dec 31, 2014), there were 358 ovarian and tubal cancer deaths in the no screening group. 9 Compared with the no screening group, the mean estimated relative mortality reduction in deaths was 11% (Cox model p=0•24) in the MMS group and 9% (Cox model p=0•32) in the USS group. Any mortality reduction was only apparent about 7 years after randomisation. 162 (45%) of 358 of the deaths in the no screening group during 2001-14 occurred before 7 years. In 2015, for the no screening versus MMS or USS comparisons, we estimated that an additional 233 no screening group events would give 80% power at a two-sided 5% significance level for a difference in relative mortality of 25% during long-term (2015-20) follow-up, conditional on the observed mortality reduction of 11%. This estimate translated to a target sample size of 591 overall events in the no screening group: all 233 new and 73% (431 of 591) of total no screening group events would occur beyond 7 years. No formal adjustment was made to the test for having previously analysed the data in 2015 or making two screen group comparisons. Instead, we decided to openly describe the multiplicity issues and acknowledge the unadjusted p values. As the number of events were less than anticipated on the planned censorship date See Online for appendix of Dec 31, 2018, follow-up was extended with a new censorship date of June 30, 2020.At previous analysis (censorship Dec 31, 2014), there were 358 ovarian and tubal cancer deaths in the no screening group. 9 Compared with the no screening group, the mean estimated relative mortality reduction in deaths was 11% (Cox model p=0•24) in the MMS group and 9% (Cox model p=0•32) in the USS group.

        <p>Descriptive statistics regarding ovarian cancer death and incidence were created including tabulations of histology, stage, and screen type by group. The primary mortality analysis was changed from the 2016 report, in which we used a Cox version of the log-rank test, 9 which is most powerful under proportional hazards. For the current analysis, we extensively discussed the best approach within trial management and trial steering committees, and consulted 12 independent international statistical, trial, and screening experts. The details and rationale underpinning this important change are reported separately. 18 In short, given the accumulating external evidence of delayed mortality effects in screening trials, most experts supported the change in primary analysis to a test that was sensitive to delayed effects. We chose the versatile test that was agnostic to the specific form of the screening effect. The versatile test, described in 2016, 18 is a combination test of three log-rank test statistics (Z 1 , Z 2 , Z 3 ), covering early, constant, and late effects respectively (appendix p 3).Descriptive statistics regarding ovarian cancer death and incidence were created including tabulations of histology, stage, and screen type by group.

        <p>We describe potential time-dependent features of the screening effect by estimating the hazard ratio (HR) and the absolute survival difference at the prespecified timepoints of 5, 10, 15, and 18 years (maximal follow-up was 19•3 years) using a flexible parametric Royston-Parmar model (appendix p 3). We undertook two secondary analyses of the primary outcome. We fitted a proportional hazards Cox model to the primary outcome data. To allow for a formal analysis of the late effects of ovarian cancer, not subject to issues of data re-use and multiple testing, we also fitted a Cox model to the new data acquired since Jan 1, 2015. Both the methods and results of sensitivity analyses are detailed in the appendix (pp 8-9). Survival from diagnosis in women with ovarian and tubal cancer in the no screening group was also compared to national age and period adjusted survival rates at 1, 5, and 10 years.

        <p>For the secondary outcome, cumulative incidence of ovarian and tubal cancer were presented graphically using standard Kaplan-Meier methods, based on time from randomisation to diagnosis. Death from other causes and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were censoring events. Administrative censorship was the same as for the mortality analysis (June 30, 2020). Ovarian and tubal cancer incidence rates were explored parametrically using a Royston-Parmar model that specifically allowed exploration of the underlying hazard functions for cancer incidence. For the secondary outcome of ovarian and tubal cancer incidence by stage, and the subgroup analysis of invasive epithelial ovarian and tubal cancers, we used incidence rate ratios with 95% CIs to compare no screening versus MMS and USS groups separately. We also calculated stage-specific ovarian and tubal cancer case fatality rates.For the secondary outcome, cumulative incidence of ovarian and tubal cancer were presented graphically using standard Kaplan-Meier methods, based on time from randomisation to diagnosis.

        <p>Between April 17, 2001 We identified 4482 women with the 19 prespecified ICD-10 codes for possible ovarian and tubal cancer who were reviewed by the outcomes review committee (appendix p 5). Of them, 2055 (45•9%) were confirmed to have ovarian or tubal cancer (table 1). The incidence of ovarian and tubal cancer per 100 000 women-years was 67•7 (95% CI 61•9-73•5; 522 cancers; 770 967 womenyears) in the MMS group, 68•2 (62•4-74•1; 517 cancers; 755 677 women-years) in the USS group, and 65•4 (61•4-69•4; 1016 cancers; 1 552 703 women-years) in the no screening group (appendix p 11). Figure 2A provides Kaplan-Meier cumulative cancer rates for all women and figure 2B provides Kaplan-Meier cumulative cancer rates for invasive epithelial ovarian and tubal cancers. Both plots show a greater number of cancer diagnoses in the screening groups during the first screening year, reflecting the lead time to diagnosis achieved by screening. The difference was largely maintained throughout the screening phase before apparent catch-up by the no screening group during the extended period of follow-up after the end of screening. However, the pattern of catch-up in the USS group was less pronounced, and this observation is elucidated by the Royston-Parmar model hazard functions (appendix pp 19-20), in which the rate of cancer incidence drops below the no screening group between years 4-14 approximately, before rising back above the no screening group rate.Between April 17, 2001 We identified 4482 women with the 19 prespecified ICD-10 codes for possible ovarian and tubal cancer who were reviewed by the outcomes review committee (appendix p 5).

        <p>Overall, 1805 (87 For the subgroup analysis of invasive epithelial ovarian and tubal cancers, the changes in stage distribution in the MMS group compared with the no screening group persisted. There was no evidence of a change in incidence in any stage in the USS group compared with the no screening group. At censorship, 1206 (0•6%) women had died of ovarian cancer: 296 (0•6%) of 50 625 in the MMS group, 291 (0•6%) of 50 623 in the USS group, and 619 (0•6%) of 101 314 in the no screening group. Ovarian and tubal cancer deaths and incidence by year from randomisation is detailed in the appendix (p 7). The versatile test (primary analysis) showed that there was no evidence of a reduction in ovarian and tubal cancer deaths in either the MMS (p=0•58) or USS (p=0•36) group compared with the no screening group (table 3). Figure 3 shows the Kaplan-Meier cumulative death rates, with any divergence between the screen and no screen groups being minimal. A sensitivity analysis that only considered data obtained by equivalent means of electronic health records across all three groups also showed no evidence of a difference using the versatile test result for both the MMS (p=0•60) and USS (p=0•37) group (appendix p 9). This analysis and other sensitivity analyses are detailed in the appendix (pp 8-9). A Cox model (secondary analysis) estimated a HR of 0•96 (95%CI 0•83-1•10) for MMS versus no screening and 0•94 (0•82-1•08) for USS versus no screening.

        <p>Our results from the largest ovarian cancer screening trial to date show that on long-term follow-up (median 16•3 years after randomisation), neither MMS or USS, as used in UKCTOCS, significantly reduced deaths from ovarian and tubal cancer. There was a 47•2% higher incidence of stage I cancer and 24•5% lower incidence of stage IV cancer, resulting in an overall 39•2% higher incidence of stage I or II cancer and 10•2% lower incidence of stage III or IV cancer in the MMS group than in the no screening group. General population screening for ovarian and tubal cancer with either of the screening strategies cannot be recommended based on evidence to date. The changes in stage distribution in the MMS group did not translate into mortality reduction, emphasising the importance of having disease-specific mortality as the primary outcome in ovarian cancer screening trials.Our results from the largest ovarian cancer screening trial to date show that on long-term follow-up (median 16•3 years after randomisation), neither MMS or USS, as used in UKCTOCS, significantly reduced deaths from ovarian and tubal cancer.

        <p>Achieving a mortality reduction will require a screening strategy that can detect ovarian and tubal cancer even earlier and in a larger proportion of women than we were able to achieve. Our findings make it even more important that before general population screening is introduced, any new test is shown to reduce ovarian and tubal cancer deaths in a future randomised controlled trial. These trials take many years to complete but the high compliance with annual screening in UKCTOCS suggests that women are very motivated to join them. Given that such trials take considerable time, it is probable that population screening for ovarian cancer is more than a decade away.Achieving a mortality reduction will require a screening strategy that can detect ovarian and tubal cancer even earlier and in a larger proportion of women than we were able to achieve.

        <p>It is difficult to extrapolate these results to ovarian cancer screening of women at high-risk, in which the strategy has involved MMS once every 3-4 months alongside risk-reducing surgery and resulted in a significant reduction in the proportion of women diagnosed with advanced disease. 20,21 Biological differences also exist between cancers in women with BRCA gene mutations and the general population, which result in improved treatment responses in carriers of BRCA mutations. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that the true effect of screening on mortality will ever be assessed in this population as a randomised controlled trial is challenging, and potentially very effective preventive measures such as risk reducing salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy are being evaluated.It is difficult to extrapolate these results to ovarian cancer screening of women at high-risk, in which the strategy has involved MMS once every 3-4 months alongside risk-reducing surgery and resulted in a significant reduction in the proportion of women diagnosed with advanced disease. 20,21 Biological differences also exist between cancers in women with BRCA gene mutations and the general population, which result in improved treatment responses in carriers of BRCA mutations.

        <p>Our results have implications for ovarian cancer symptom awareness campaigns as most women who were screen-detected had no high-alert symptoms 22 and were diagnosed earlier than would have been possible with a symptom-based approach. Our findings suggest that earlier diagnosis of invasive epithelial ovarian and tubal cancer in the symptomatic population is unlikely to translate into reduced mortality. However, it is important to note that there have been substantial advances in the treatment of advanced disease in the past 10 years since the end of screening in Dec 31, 2011. The advances in treatment, in combination with earlier diagnosis could contribute to better quality of life and improved outcomes. In addition, achieving a rapid diagnosis is of great importance to women and their families.Our results have implications for ovarian cancer symptom awareness campaigns as most women who were screen-detected had no high-alert symptoms 22 and were diagnosed earlier than would have been possible with a symptom-based approach.

        <p>Our mortality results are similar to those reported for ovarian cancer screening in the Prostate Lung Colorectal Ovarian (PLCO) cancer screening trial, the only other large randomised controlled trial to report on the effects of ovarian cancer screening on mortality. 7,8 In the PLCO trial, no evidence was seen of a reduction in ovarian cancer deaths between the screen and no screen arms, either at median follow-up of 12•4 7 or 14•7 8 years. However, in UKCTOCS, we found a higher incidence of stage I and lower incidence of stage IV disease in the MMS group than in the no screening group. The PLCO trial found no evidence of a difference in stage distribution between the screened and non-screened groups. 7,8 The use of a longitudinal CA125 algorithm in the MMS group instead of a single CA125 cutoff, as in the PLCO trial, might have contributed to this difference. We have previously shown that a longitudinal algorithm allows us to detect disease earlier and with greater sensitivity than a single CA125 cutoff. 23,24 Despite the 24•5% reduction in stage IV disease in the MMS group, the overall reduction in stage III or IV incidence 9•5 years after end of screening was only 10%, with little change in stage III incidence. Previous reports have highlighted the need for a large reduction in latestage incidence as a prerequisite for reducing cancer mortality. However, it should be noted that the length of follow-up and, therefore, the dilution effect in the screen groups of inclusion of cancers diagnosed clinically after end of screening varied in these reports. An analysis of breast cancer screening trials found no reduction in breast cancer mortality in trials that achieved less than 10% reduction in stage III or IV disease and a mean reduction of 28% in trials that saw a 20% or greater reduction. 25 In colorectal and lung cancer screening, much of the mortality reduction is related to reductions in stage IV disease, which has much higher mortality than earlier stages. 26,27 For ovarian and tubal cancer, the high mortality associated with stage III and IV disease, combined with most women clinically detected with stage III disease, requires a substantial reduction in the incidence of both stages before a mortality reduction is possible.Our mortality results are similar to those reported for ovarian cancer screening in the Prostate Lung Colorectal Ovarian (PLCO) cancer screening trial, the only other large randomised controlled trial to report on the effects of ovarian cancer screening on mortality. 7,8 In the PLCO trial, no evidence was seen of a reduction in ovarian cancer deaths between the screen and no screen arms, either at median follow-up of 12•4 7 or 14•7 8 years.

        <p>There are previous instances in which increased incidence of stage I or II cancers in the screen group in screening trials did not translate to a mortality reduction. In the four early randomised controlled trials of lung cancer, 28 compared with the control group, the screened groups showed significant improvements in stage distribution. However, much of the screen-detected early stage disease cases in these trials were indolent. This finding in the lung cancer trials was accompanied by a significant increase in cancer incidence in the screen groups, but no reduction in late-stage incidence. Both together suggest that overdiagnosis was the main contributor to the absence of reduction in mortality. 28 This result differs from UKCTOCS, in which no significant increase in cancer incidence was observed in either of the screen groups. In the MMS group of UKCTOCS, it seems probable that the cancers shifted to an earlier stage had an intrinsic poor prognosis, which was not altered by earlier detection and the available treatments for early stage disease. Further histopathological and genetic analysis of these early stage screen-detected cancers could yield important information about the biology of ovarian cancer.There are previous instances in which increased incidence of stage I or II cancers in the screen group in screening trials did not translate to a mortality reduction.

        <p>The key strengths of UKCTOCS have been previously detailed 9 and include scale; multicentre design; adherence to protocol through use of a bespoke webbased trial management system with automation of key processes, remote data entry, and concurrent central monitoring; completeness of follow-up through linkage to national registries and administrative databases; and independent assignment of site and cause of death. The longitudinal algorithm we used since 2001 to interpret CA125 concentrations was innovative and forward thinking. The UK Government's Accelerating Detection of Disease Programmme includes collection of repeat biological samples that will enable building of such algorithms. We re-staged all cases using the latest FIGO 2014 criteria and revised our ovarian and tubal cancer site assignment using WHO 2014 classification to reflect current understanding of disease biology. We also changed our primary analysis approach from a constanteffect approach (proportional hazards Cox-model) to one that allows for a delayed effect (the versatile test) to reflect growing evidence that the mortality reduction in cancer-screening trials, if present, is delayed. We did this through a transparent process with publication of our methods and the expert opinions that underpinned our decision. 18 Much has been learnt from the design, conduct, and analysis of UKCTOCS, which is relevant to future large-scale trials. In addition, a large bioresource of serum samples (&gt;550 000) and linked data (UKCTOCS Longitudinal Women's Cohort) has been built through the generosity of the participants. The resource includes a rare sample set of up to 11 annual blood samples from women in the MMS group. In ovarian cancer, it has allowed us to collaborate to explore new biomarkers and develop longitudinal algorithms. 24 The data provides a unique opportunity to study the natural history of ovarian and tubal cancer. Important research is also underway on early detection of other cancers and risk stratification in cardiovascular disease using this bioresource.The key strengths of UKCTOCS have been previously detailed 9 and include scale; multicentre design; adherence to protocol through use of a bespoke webbased trial management system with automation of key processes, remote data entry, and concurrent central monitoring; completeness of follow-up through linkage to national registries and administrative databases; and independent assignment of site and cause of death.

        <p>A key limitation of the trial is the interval from end of screening in 2011 to censorship in 2020, which raises the possibility of dilution of the screening effect.
