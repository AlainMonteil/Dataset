        <p>This position statement from the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology Cardio-Oncology Study Group in collaboration with the International Cardio-Oncology Society presents practical, easy-to-use and evidence-based risk stratification tools for oncologists, haemato-oncologists and cardiologists to use in their clinical practice to risk stratify oncology patients prior to receiving cancer therapies known to cause heart failure or other serious cardiovascular toxicities. Baseline risk stratification proformas are presented for oncology patients prior to receiving the following cancer therapies: anthracycline chemotherapy, HER2-targeted therapies such as trastuzumab, vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors, second and third generation multi-targeted kinase inhibitors for chronic myeloid leukaemia targeting BCR-ABL, multiple myeloma therapies (proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs), RAF and MEK inhibitors or androgen deprivation therapies. Applying these risk stratification proformas will allow clinicians to stratify cancer patients into low, medium, high and very high risk of cardiovascular complications prior to starting treatment, with the aim of improving personalised approaches to minimise the risk of cardiovascular toxicity from cancer therapies.</p>
        <p>There is a growing epidemic of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in cancer patients during and after cancer treatment. Improved cancer-related survival and the development of more targeted molecular therapies, in addition to the continued use of anthracycline chemotherapy, have resulted in a significant increase in both current and previously treated cancer patients presenting to cardiology services with CVD. 1 The frequency of cardiovascular (CV) problems is higher in cancer patients who are receiving or who have previously received cancer treatments with a known CV toxicity profile. The average age of oncology patients is also increasing with the general ageing of the population, which is in part due to improved survival from CVD. Therefore, there are a rising number of patients who present to oncology and haemato-oncology services not only with a new cancer diagnosis but also with pre-existing CVD or risk factors for CVD. 1 This poses a particular challenge when considering evidence-based oncology treatments that improve survival but impart a higher risk of CV toxicity.</p>
        <p>. Current oncology practice, including treatment planning and protocols for cancer treatments with potentially CV toxicity, provides unique opportunities to comprehensively assess CV health before initiation of cancer treatment. This allows cardiologists and other healthcare professionals, working in partnership with oncologists and haemato-oncologists, to optimise the management of pre-existing CVD and modifiable CV risk factors with the aim of reducing the risk of CV complications during and after cancer treatment. The assessment occurring prior to the initiation of cancer treatment and in patients without overt CVD or previous cardiotoxicity can be considered a primary prevention strategy while interventions in patients with pre-existing CVD or evidence of prior CV toxicity fall into the category of secondary prevention (Figure 1). Specialist care of CVD in cancer patients is now offered by dedicated cardio-oncology services which have emerged over the last 10 years. 2,3 This multidisciplinary approach has the potential not only to reduce morbidity and mortality from CVD, but also to improve cancer outcomes by reducing interruptions in cancer treatment due to CV events and facilitate treatment options with greater potential CV risk. The aim of a multidisciplinary cardio-oncology approach is to support best practice, guideline-directed cancer care by maintaining cancer patients on effective therapies for as long as recommended, and increase the proportion of cancer patients who complete their cancer treatment without interruption for CVD.</p>
        <p>Many studies have identified a range of parameters that contribute to CVD risk, but these risk factors are not routinely and systematically assessed in oncology and haemato-oncology units at the time of cancer diagnosis or during cancer treatment (Figure 2). Several guidelines and expert position statements have been published by professional societies of cardiology, oncology and cardio-oncology focussed on CVD in cancer patients and all recommend baseline CV risk assessment in cancer patients prior to starting potentially cardiotoxic cancer treatments. 1,[4][5][6] However, there is no standardised system or risk assessment tool to facilitate CV risk stratification in oncology and haemato-oncology services.</p>
        <p>The Cardio-Oncology Study Group from the Heart Failure Association (HFA) of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) hosted a workshop in collaboration with the International Cardio-Oncology Society (ICOS) dedicated to the development of 'Baseline CV risk stratification proformas' that can be used by oncology and haemato-oncology teams to stratify cancer patients for CV risk before initiation of potentially cardiotoxic cancer therapies (Table 1). This position statement summarises the evidence reviewed at the workshop and subsequently by the co-authors of this paper, and proposes new HFA-ICOS baseline CV risk stratification proformas for seven classes of cancer therapies which are associated with significant risk of CVD, including but not limited to heart failure (HF).</p>
        <p>The assessment of baseline CV risk in cancer patients before starting potentially CV toxic cancer therapies is based on the following core principles:</p>
        <p>• Risk is a continuous variable.</p>
        <p>• Multiple CV risk factors may co-exist in an individual cancer patient and they have an additive or synergistic contribution to CV risk. • Evidence or expert consensus exists that a parameter contributes to future risk of CVD and justifies its inclusion in the baseline CV risk assessment proforma. • Increased absolute risk (rather than relative risk) is the most relevant for individual patient-based treatment decisions and the relative importance attributed to these risk factors. • Cancer patients identified at increased risk of cancer treatment-related CV toxicity using these baseline CV risk assessment proformas should not have their evidence-based cancer treatment withheld unless they are identified at high or very high risk and after multidisciplinary discussion between the treating oncologist/haematologist and cardiologist. • Decisions regarding switching to alternative less cardiotoxic cancer treatments in cancer patients identified at high or very high risk of CVD should only be made after multidisciplinary team discussion between the treating oncologist/haematologist and cardiologist, balancing treatment efficacy vs. safety and CV risk for a particular individual. • The cancer patient should be informed and participate in the decision making process and be informed of their baseline CV risk level. • Cardiovascular treatment interventions should be considered to mitigate CV risk in cancer patients when identified. • Pathways of care should exist within an institution using these proformas so that patients with increased CV risk (medium, high or very high) have their pre-existing CVD and modifiable CV risk factors reviewed and optimised by a suitable healthcare professional (e.g. cardio-oncology service, cardiologist or primary care/family physician) depending on the nature of the risk, the cardiotoxic treatment planned and healthcare system. • Baseline CV risk assessment proformas should be easy to understand and implement in oncology and haemato-oncology services.</p>
        <p>• The application and impact of baseline CV risk assessment proformas can be assessed using an appropriate clinical audit and review.</p>
        <p>Several cancer drug therapies associated with clinically important rates of CV toxicity during or after treatment exposure are summarised in There is growing use of immune therapies in oncology, and there is now considerable evidence of CV toxicities from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and emerging information of HF complicating cytokine release syndrome following chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapies for various cancers. [7][8][9] Whilst no evidence currently exists regarding which clinical, imaging and laboratory parameters may identify patients at higher risk, given the severity of these complications we recommend all patients scheduled to receive ICI or CAR-T therapy have a baseline echocardiogram, electrocardiogram (ECG) and measurement of cardiac troponin and a natriuretic peptide, which serve as a baseline reference if new cardiac complications develop. Baseline CV risk assessment proformas have been developed for seven cardiotoxic cancer therapy classes known to cause a range of CV toxicities including left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) and HF (Tables 2345678). The risk is estimated for all CV complications from the drug class, e.g. left ventricular dysfunction, QTc prolongation and arrhythmias, vascular events including myocardial infarction (MI) and hypertension:</p>
        <p>• Anthracycline chemotherapy: the main CV complications of anthracycline chemotherapy are LVD and HF, and atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.

        <p>Each risk factor class includes a range of risk factors or variables identified as contributing to CV risk for patients receiving the specific cancer therapy according to the evidence available and expert opinion.</p>
        <p>Once completed, a risk level can be calculated from the summary using the following simple rules: • Patients with one medium 1 risk factor only are 'low risk'</p>
        <p>• Patients with a single medium 2 risk factor or more than one medium 1 risk factor with points totalling 2-4 are 'medium risk' • Patients with several medium risk factors with points totalling 5 or more points are 'high risk'</p>
        <p>Evidence for defining the absolute risk is limited or absent for each risk factor for every drug class. Based on discussion and expert opinion, the risk of future cardiotoxicity for each of the risk groups can be considered as follows: low risk &lt;2%, medium © 2020 The Authors. European Journal of Heart Failure published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of European Society of Cardiology.

These should be considered a guide and future studies are needed to validate and refine these ranges and risk weighting.</p>
        <p>The seventh baseline CV risk assessment proforma relates to ADT including GnRH agonists and other anti-androgens (e.g. 17𝛼-hydroxylase inhibitors) used for prostate cancer. The risks relate to the development of atherosclerotic vascular disease, and there are several established CV risk calculators for MI and stroke associated with atherosclerosis (Table 9 and ADT baseline CV risk assessment proformas). [86][87][88] The risk categories are different from those for the other oncology drugs as they are based on the 10-year risk of events. Low risk = no risk factor OR one medium 1 risk factor; Medium risk = medium risk factors with a total of 2-4 points; High risk = medium risk factors with a total of ≥5 points OR any high risk factor; Very high risk = any very high risk factor. a Atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation. b Left ventricular wall thickness &gt;1.2 cm. c Elevated above the upper limit of normal for local laboratory reference range. d Systolic blood pressure &gt;140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;90 mmHg, or on treatment. e Glycated haemoglobin &gt;7.0% or &gt;53 mmol/mol or on treatment. f Non-high-density liporotein cholesterol level &gt;3.8 mmol/L (&gt;145 mg/dL). g Estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 .</p>

        <p>• &lt;10% 10-year risk = low risk level • 10-19% 10-year risk = medium risk level • ≥20% 10-year risk = high risk level</p>
        <p>The result should be communicated to the patient and to the appropriate healthcare professionals (primary care physician, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . cardiologist, cardio-oncologist) to address modifiable CV risk factors according to ESC guidelines for CVD prevention. 86 These are primary prevention CV risk calculators and are only suitable for cancer patients scheduled to receive ADT who have not previously presented with the clinical manifestations of atherosclerotic disease. Any prostate cancer patient with a previous history of CVD is high risk and should be evaluated by an appropriate healthcare professional to review their symptom status and CV risk factor control. These CV risk calculators are not suitable for other cardiotoxic cancer therapies where there is an increased Low risk = no risk factor OR one medium 1 risk factor; Medium risk = medium risk factors with a total of 2-4 points; High risk = medium risk factors with a total of ≥5 points OR any high risk factor; Very high risk = any very high risk factor. a Atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation. b Elevated above the upper limit of normal for local laboratory reference range. c Systolic blood pressure &gt;140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;90 mmHg, or on treatment. d Glycated haemoglobin &gt;7.0% or &gt;53 mmol/mol, or on treatment. e Estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . f Previous malignancy. Please see online supplementary Table S7 for the 1 page printable version for clinical use. risk of HF, hypertension, QT prolongation and other CVDs. In addition, data on the increased CV risk in women receiving GnRH agonists for breast or ovarian cancer are lacking and therefore this proforma is currently only applicable to men with prostate cancer scheduled to receive a GnRH agonist.</p>
        <p>We recommend completion of the baseline CV risk assessment proformas in all patients scheduled to receive one of the seven oncology drug classes with potential cardiotoxicity listed in Table 1. This can be performed after the decision has been made by the treating oncologist or haematologist to start a potentially cardiotoxic cancer treatment. It is important to emphasise that this needs to be completed promptly so that cancer treatment is not delayed and can be commenced safely. In emergency scenarios, guideline-based cancer treatment should be commenced and the baseline CV risk assessment proformas can be completed once clinical stability has been achieved (e.g. CML presenting with blast crisis, solid tumours presenting with acute oncological emergencies). Following completion of the baseline CV risk assessment proformas the risk level should be recorded in the patient's medical records, reviewed by the treating oncologist or haemato-oncologist and communicated to the patient and their primary care physician. The specific treatment pathways for each of the drug categories and risk levels is beyond the scope of this position statement and will be addressed in a future HFA position statement, but the authors recommend, conceptually, the following general principles until more detailed guidance is available:</p>
        <p>• Low risk level cancer patients continue with treatment with CV surveillance as appropriate according to local, national and international guidelines. • Medium risk cancer patients require closer monitoring of CV health during treatment or consideration for referral for a cardio-oncology or cardiology assessment. • High and very high risk level patients are referred for a cardio-oncology or cardiology assessment, ideally in a specialist cardio-oncology service (if available) to optimise management of their pre-existing CVD and modifiable CV risk factors, and provide a personalised management plan for surveillance during cancer treatment.</p>
        <p>It is important that pathways exist to minimise the time delay from risk assessment and referral to cardiology clinical assessment, and the decision and management plan are communicated to the referring oncology or haemato-oncology team promptly to prevent any delay in starting cancer treatment, following the core principles of a cardio-oncology service. 2 The timing and nature of CV surveillance recommendations will depend upon various factors including the cardiotoxicity profile of the cancer therapy required (Table 1), the risk factors contributing to the risk level calculation and patient preference. We recommend that following implementation of these risk proformas, which could be digital or paper-based depending upon local medical records, an audit and review of the risk stratification process is performed to identify the frequency of application, percentage of risk assessments completed, the actions taken from the assessment and how that conforms to local pathways and standards of care. Oncologists and haemato-oncologists should identify cardiologists with whom to collaborate in setting up pathways of care for their high risk and very high risk patients. If cardiology support is not available locally, then whilst identifying regional or national options these risk proformas should provide a guide for oncologists to consider alternative, non-cardiotoxic cancer therapies in patients identified as high risk or very high risk where alternative treatment options are available. In the long term collection of outcome data, and comparison to retrospective datasets regarding CV events, could be considered. We suggest collaborative studies between centres implementing these risk stratification proformas to assess their impact in reducing CV complications of cancer therapies as well as changes in the overall cancer and CV outcomes. Large datasets can also serve to refine the weighting of risk for the different parameters for each cancer drug class, with the ultimate aim to improve the sensitivity and predictive value.</p>
        <p>Cardiology and oncology professional society guidelines and expert position statements on CVD in cancer patients uniformly recommend baseline CV risk assessment for oncology patients scheduled to receive potentially cardiotoxic cancer therapies. 1,[4][5][6] Here we present proformas for baseline CV risk assessment which can be employed by oncology and haemato-oncology services for patients scheduled to receive one of seven cardiotoxic cancer therapies. Assessment of baseline CV risk is part of a personalised approach to care for cancer patients. The identification of cancer patients who are at an increased risk of CV complications in a timely manner is important so that appropriate measures can be implemented to eliminate or at least mitigate their CV risk and ensure, where possible, that cancer patients receive their treatment safely. There is the potential for these proformas to be electronic with semi-automated population of the fields from the electronic patient record if a suitable platform exists. Future studies are required to validate and refine these proformas, including the specific weighting of each risk factor and the addition of new risk factors as they are identified. The impact of proformas upon overall survival and both CV-related and cancer-related outcomes and mortality needs to be assessed as well. The long-term goal is to improve both oncology and CV outcomes for this patient population through a personalised approach to CV risk, which should allow cancer patients to complete their evidence-based cancer treatments free from CV toxicity and CVD, leading to an improvement in overall survival.</p>
