        <p>A total of 2974 Italian subjects has completed an online survey, but only 2524 subjects resulted eligible for this study. The questionnaire measured the total weekly physical activity energy expenditure before and during quarantine (i.e. the sum of walking, moderate-intensity physical activities, and vigorous-intensity physical activities) in Metabolic Equivalent Task minutes per week (MET-min/wk) using an adapted version of International Physical Activity Questionnaire and their psychological well-being using the Psychological General Well Being Index. Of the 2524 Italian subjects included in the study, 1426 were females (56.4%) and 1098 males (43.6%). Total physical activity significantly decreased between before and during COVID-19 pandemic (Mean: 2429 vs. 1577 MET-min/wk, ****p &lt; 0.0001), in all age groups and especially in men (Female, mean: 1994(Female, mean: vs. 1443 MET-min/wk, ****p &lt; 0.0001; Male, mean: 2998 vs. 1754 MET-min/wk, ****p &lt; 0.0001). Furthermore, a significant positive correlation was found between the variation of physical activity and mental well-being (r ¼ 0.07541, ***p ¼ 0.0002), suggesting that the reduction of total physical activity had a profoundly negative impact on psychological health and well-being of population.A total of 2974 Italian subjects has completed an online survey, but only 2524 subjects resulted eligible for this study.

        <p>In late December 2019, an epidemic of cases with unknown low respiratory infections occurred in Wuhan, the largest metropolitan area in China's Hubei province. This disease was caused by a new coronavirus (CoV) named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as announced by World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020.In late December 2019, an epidemic of cases with unknown low respiratory infections occurred in Wuhan, the largest metropolitan area in China's Hubei province.

        <p>In the following weeks, infections spread across China and other countries, including Italy, and COVID-19 epidemic has become a global health threat. In Italy, according to last updated of the Italian Ministry of Health (May 1, 2020 at 6.00 pm) it has been turned out 17.569 patients with symptoms, 1.578 intensive care, 81.769 home isolation, 100.943 total currently positive, 78.249 dismissed/healed, 28.236 deaths, 207.428 total cases [1]. Total infected and total death by Italian regions is displayed in Table 1. The Italian patients' median age was 62 years, the median age of fatalities is 80.5 years old, whereas few cases of COVID-19 have been found in very young people [1]. As indicated by Wu and coauthors [2], the rate of death drastically increased in patients already affected by one or more pathologies, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Understanding the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is important, although they are nonspecific and ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe respiratory failure. Common symptoms of COVID-19 comprise fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue and dyspnea [3,4]. The transmission of COVID-19 occurs mainly through droplet and close contact [5]. Its transmission through oral or conjunctival way is still unknown, but SARS-CoV-2 has been found in tears, and Lu and coauthors reported that human conjunctival epithelium could be easily contaminated by infected droplets or other body fluids [6]. Given powerful transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 by human-to-human, since the outbreak of COVID-19 in Italy, response efforts by the Italian Government have been directed to restrain the spread of the virus. A lockdown was imposed on some northern region on 8 March, and within days, the quarantine was extended to throughout the peninsula. To ensure social distancing and limit the movement of the population, schools, public places and businesses were shutdowns. Moreover, people can move away from their home only to do essential work (healthcare and social care sectors, police and armed forces, firefighting, water and electricity supply) or perform essential activities (health visits, purchasing medicines or food). Although this strategy has been reported to be efficacy for containing the COVID-19 outbreak, also the quarantine may be associated with several undesirable effects, due to alteration of social habits. In particular, prolonged self-isolation has a negative impact on the psychological response, promoting post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anxiety [7]. Moreover, quarantine leads to physical inactivity, which contributes to adverse health changes such as premature ageing, obesity, cardiovascular vulnerability, muscle atrophy, bone loss and decreased aerobic capacity [8]. Literature has largely described the positive role exerted by physical activity to ameliorate general health, acting on heart, circulatory and respiratory as well as immune function [9,10]. Exercise is able to counteract metabolic disorder, bone, muscle, joint pathologies and neurodegenerative disease [11,12,13,14,15,16,17]. Long term detraining, as for this COVID-19 forced stop, leads to a marked decline of the maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), reduced endurance capacity, loss of muscle strength and mass, tendon ruptures and reduced joint tribology [18]. Regular physical activity is a key health behaviour from a public health perspective, as it has a remarkable impact on health. In respect to upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), caused by pathogens like COVID-19, physical activity may ameliorate pathological outcomes, by promoting the release of stress hormones responsible for reducing excessive local inflammation within the respiratory tract and by inducing the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-10, in order to prevent excessively prolonged T helper type 1 (Th1) cell population activity against the pathogen, leading to cell damage and necrosis [19,20]. Several evidences have also demonstrated that physical activity can be effective in ameliorating the mental well-being and having the potential to prevent symptoms of mental health disorder such as depression and anxiety [21,22,23,24]. Based on these evidences, the purpose of this survey study was to examine (1) changes in the physical activity levels during self-quarantine in Italy; (2) the correlation between physical activity and well-being of individuals. To this end, it has been used an online questionnaire containing an adapted version of short-form of International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-SF), to assess the practised level of physical activity and Metabolic Equivalents (MET) energy expenditure, and the Psychological General Well Being Index (PGWBI) to evaluate psychological and general well-being.In the following weeks, infections spread across China and other countries, including Italy, and COVID-19 epidemic has become a global health threat.

        <p>The online questionnaire (https://forms.gle/8254mc5WfeKs8nDz8) administered to the participants included five explanations of the kind of physical activity and 55 questions comprising demographic, anthropometric, socioeconomic data and health status shown in Table A of supplementary materials, an adapted version of short-form of International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-SF) and the Psychological General Well Being Index (PGWBI). The questions of IPAQ-SF allowed to assess physical activity by providing information about the minutes per day or days per week, at any time of the day, spent doing activities before COVID-19 emergency and in the last four weeks. Participants reported the frequency and duration of different types of activity: vigorous (i.e. heavy lifting, performing intense aerobic exercises, using bike or treadmill); moderate (i.e. carrying light loads and bicycling at a regular pace carry, work out in the garden); walking activities, as well as the average time, spent sitting on a weekday, including sitting at work. Responses were converted to Metabolic Equivalent Task minutes per week (METmin/week) though automatic scoring of the IPAQ-S [26]. Based on the IPAQ recommendations for scoring protocol, participants of the study was classified in three different groups of physical activity considering the MET-min/wk of the sum of walking, moderate-intensity physical activities, and vigorous-intensity physical activities: low active (&lt;600 MET-minutes/week); moderate active (!600 MET-minutes/week) and high active (!3000 MET-minutes/week) (http://www.ipaq.ki.se).The online questionnaire (https://forms.gle/8254mc5WfeKs8nDz8) administered to the participants included five explanations of the kind of physical activity and 55 questions comprising demographic, anthropometric, socioeconomic data and health status shown in Table A of supplementary materials, an adapted version of short-form of International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-SF) and the Psychological General Well Being Index (PGWBI).

        <p>Participants had to give information (before and during the COVID-19 quarantine) related to vigorous and moderate-intensity physical activity as well as walking activity and sedentary behaviours. Vigorous-intensity physical activities comprising heavy lifting, use of home gym machines, work out/courses on the online platform and others fitness instruments, demand a hard physical effort that increases the breathing rate more frequently than normal. Moderate-intensity physical activities can include carrying a light load or performing aerobic exercises at a modest intensity. Examination of the total physical activity in MET-minutes/ week demonstrated a statistically significant difference between before and during COVID-19 pandemic (Mean: 2429 vs. 1577 MET-min/wk, ****p &lt; 0.0001) (Figure 1A). Specifically, scores of vigorous physical activity (Mean: 1109 vs. 766.6 MET-min/wk, ****p &lt; 0.0001), moderate activity (Mean: 574 vs. 523.3 MET-min/wk, *p ¼ 0.0188) and walking (Mean: 746 vs. 287.6 MET-min/wk, ****p &lt; 0.0001) of subjects during COVID-19 emergency were significantly lower than those of the period before quarantine (Figure 1A).Participants had to give information (before and during the COVID-19 quarantine) related to vigorous and moderate-intensity physical activity as well as walking activity and sedentary behaviours.

        <p>Results of the IPAQ scoring showed that before COVID-19 emergency 23.06% of participants are low active (&lt;600 MET-minutes/week), 35.18% are moderate active (!600 MET-minutes/week) and 41.76% are high active (!3000 MET-minutes/week).Results of the IPAQ scoring showed that before COVID-19 emergency 23.06% of participants are low active (&lt;600 MET-minutes/week), 35.18% are moderate active (!600 MET-minutes/week) and 41.76% are high active (!3000 MET-minutes/week).</p>
        <p>During COVID-19 quarantine, percentage of low active individuals increased up to 39.62%, whereas 29.75% and 30.63% were moderate active and high active, respectively (Table 3).During COVID-19 quarantine, percentage of low active individuals increased up to 39.62%, whereas 29.75% and 30.63% were moderate active and high active, respectively (Table 3).</p>
        <p>As shown in Figure 1B, the levels of physical activity of participants classified before COVID-19 as high active and moderate active, drastically decreased during COVID-19 pandemic (Mean: 4400 vs. 2432 MET-min/wk, ****p &lt; 0.0001; Mean: 1354 vs. 1077 MET-min/wk, ****p &lt; 0.0001, respectively). These results suggest that the limitations imposed by quarantine, have induced that part of population that usually performed moderate and high levels of physical activity to decrease their regular and habitual level during the forced period. On the contrary, individuals classified before COVID-19 as low active significantly increased total weekly physical activity energy expenditure during quarantine (Mean: 408.1 vs 755.3 MET-min/wk, ****p &lt; 0.0001). This unexpected result could be due to the greater housework activities carried out by these subjects forced to stay at homes, compared to before quarantine. Accordingly, the variation of MET-min/week (i.e. during vs before) is positive only in the low group. Moreover, Δ-MET values are statistically different among the three groups (****p &lt; 0.0001) (Figure 1C).As shown in Figure 1B, the levels of physical activity of participants classified before COVID-19 as high active and moderate active, drastically decreased during COVID-19 pandemic (Mean: 4400 vs. 2432 MET-min/wk, ****p &lt; 0.0001; Mean: 1354 vs. 1077 MET-min/wk, ****p &lt; 0.0001, respectively).

        <p>To evaluate if changes in physical activity levels during the COVID-19 emergency affect psychological well-being, a Spearman's ρ correlation was run to determine the relation between Δ-MET-min/week and total PGWBI score. As shown in Figure 3A, a significant positive correlation was found between the variation of physical activity and mental wellbeing, suggesting that reduction of total physical activity is related to worse status of psychological well-being (r ¼ 0.07541, ***p ¼ 0.0002). Interestingly, the correlation between physical activity and psychological well-being depending on gender showed a higher positive correlation in female (r ¼ 0.1758, ****p &lt; 0.0001) as compared to male group (r ¼ 0.06356, *p ¼ 0.0366), suggesting that variations in physical activity habits could more influence the psychological status of women than men (Figure 3B-C).To evaluate if changes in physical activity levels during the COVID-19 emergency affect psychological well-being, a Spearman's ρ correlation was run to determine the relation between Δ-MET-min/week and total PGWBI score.

        <p>The worldwide spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection led the Italian Government to apply unprecedented containment measures. The Decree of the Italian Prime Minister of March 20, 2020 has been issued to state an absolute ban to get away from their home, except to make essential work or activities. Quarantine has upset the normality of Italian daily life, forcing population to social distancing and self-isolation. The precautionary measures have also involved sport-related activities, including walking and running outside. Therefore, home workout remained the only possibility to play sports and stay active during Covid-19 pandemic. In the present work, we analyzed the total MET-min/wk before-and during COVID-19 quarantine and assess the relationship with the psychological well-being of 2524 participants, of which 41.76% was classified as a highly active group. Certainly, our study sample is very limited as compared to other work present in the current literature, such as the work by Jin and coauthors which included more than 500000 individuals, even if the treated topic was different [28]. To date, in Italy is not present a national health monitoring and surveillance system for physical activity, and no studies have collected large data showing the different activity levels of the general public [29]. However, data for the years 2010-2013 from the survey by the Italian Ministry of Health's Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (Progressi delle Aziende Sanitarie per la Salute in Italia (PASSI)) [30], showed that 36% of Italian adults of 30-60 years and 24% of older adults of aged 60 þ years meet the recommended physical activity levels. Moreover, in line with our results, a very recent study conducted on Sicilian population [31], showed that before COVID-19 quarantine, 44% and 50% of participants were moderate active and high active, respectively. Although the scientific community has highlighted the real benefits to stay active during the pandemic, our results showed a strong reduction of physical activity levels, especially for vigorous activity and walking. These data reflect the major difficulties to walk and perform an intense exercise at home, compared to moderate activity. The WHO recommends practising at least 150 min per week of moderate to vigorous-intensity physical activity or 75 min of high intensity per week, or a combination of both [29,32]. Although running, fast swimming, playing basketball, soccer, represent vigorous-intensity activities burn more than 3000 MET-minutes/week, many other intense exercises can be performed staying at home, such as carrying/moving heavy load (&gt;20 kg) or stair walking. Stairs can be found in most private homes, and stair climbing (at least 10 min per day) is considered a vigorous-intensity activity [33]. An opposite trend was found for subjects classified as low active before COVID-19, whose total physical activity energy expenditure during quarantine significantly increased. This phenomenon could be due to a radical change in everyday schedules and habits. People remaining at home spend much more time in low-intensity activities like housework (cooking, washing dishes or gardening). Another reason could be the greater female presence in the study that is generally more prone to do low-intensity activities. Our study also showed that during the pandemic, the physical activity levels significantly decreased in all age groups considered. Moreover, the male group showed highly significant variation between before and during COVID-19 emergency as compared to the female group. Previous works have largely indicated gender differences in exercise habits and motivations for exercise [34,35,36,37]. Men practice physical activity mainly for social and competitive reasons. Moreover, they prefer to practice sports, outdoor and/or in public places like the gym and fitness clubs. Females are more inclined to exercise in home-setting, practising aerobics, dancing, yoga, pilates or circuits with push-ups, squats, planks and jumping jacks. Furthermore, the lower variation in physical activity levels between before and during quarantine found in women is possibly explained by the higher amount of housework physical activity than males [37,38]. Secondly, we investigated the impact of physical activity on psychological well-being during the pandemic. Our results showed that the reduction of physical activity levels is ever related to the worse status of psychological well-being. The positive effects of regular physical activity on psychological health are indisputable in the field of modern medicine. Regular exercise improves one's self-esteem and a sense of well-being. Individuals who exercise regularly exhibit fewer depressive and anxiety symptoms, thus supporting the concept that physical activity provides a beneficial effect against the development of mental disorders [39]. Several studies have demonstrated that the anxiolytic effects of regular exercise are linked to change in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and mediation of the endogenous opioid system, which are involved in stress reactivity, anxiety, mood and emotional responses [40,41,42]. Furthermore, physical activity is implicated in the modulation of different trophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF, whose levels are upregulated following exercise, represents the most abundant neurotrophin in the brain, which positively influences both anxiety and depressive disorders [43]. We found that the correlation between the reduction of physical activity and psychological well-being is stronger in the female group. Previous studies have examined gender differences between measures of physical fitness and life satisfaction, that is one of the central constructs in the field of positive psychology. Although most of them reflecting no difference between genders and life satisfaction, some works demonstrated higher life satisfaction measures among females when compared with males. This evidence suggests that reduction of physical activity levels may mostly influence mental well-being of female group [44,45,46,47]. The current study also showed a significant correlation between the change in total activity and the PGWBI score in subjects classified as high active and moderate active as well as in the young adult group. The latter result is supported by previous studies demonstrating the strong relationship between physical activity and psychological well-being in this age group [47,48,49].The worldwide spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection led the Italian Government to apply unprecedented containment measures.

        <p>Although the negative impact on psychological well-being due to the reduction of physical activity levels is a dogma, currently in the literature there is only one study conducted in Canada that can strengthen our present results, regarding the worsen of psychophysical conditions during a period of forced rest due to a pandemic [50]. Generally, it is the individual to choose if perform or not physical activity, but the COVID-19 spread changed the world. Gyms, stadiums, pools, dance and fitness studios, physiotherapy centres, parks and playgrounds were closed, compelling people to find alternatives to exercise. Consequently, different life habits have been affected, with the modification of routines of mobility, physical activity, and habitual exercise protocols. Under such unusual conditions, barriers to keep an active life's style were hard to overcome. For the above reasons, we studied the impact of physical activity on psychological health during Covid-19 pandemic in Italy. The benefits of exercise are proven very helpful, especially in times of anxiety, crisis and fear. There are concerns therefore that, in the context of the pandemic, lack of access to regular sporting or exercise routines resulted in challenges to the immune system, physical health, including by leading to the commencement of or exacerbating existing diseases that have their roots in a sedentary lifestyle. Lack of access to exercise and physical activity had also mental health impacts, compound stress or anxiety that many experienced in the face of isolation from normal social life. Possible loss of family or friends from the virus and impact of the virus on one's economic well-being and access to nutrition exacerbated these effects.Although the negative impact on psychological well-being due to the reduction of physical activity levels is a dogma, currently in the literature there is only one study conducted in Canada that can strengthen our present results, regarding the worsen of psychophysical conditions during a period of forced rest due to a pandemic [50].

        <p>The limitations of this study included the over-reporting bias of physical activity as well as to report at the same time point, information related to exercise levels before-and during COVID-19. However, IPAQ questionnaires may supply a reliable approximation of physical activity at a population level, and its validity has been confirmed in different studies [51,52].The limitations of this study included the over-reporting bias of physical activity as well as to report at the same time point, information related to exercise levels before-and during COVID-19.

        <p>In conclusion, our results, for the first time in the literature, have shown that quarantine in Italy induces a significant reduction of total weekly physical activity energy expenditure in all age groups and especially in men, and this reduction negatively affects the psychological well-being.In conclusion, our results, for the first time in the literature, have shown that quarantine in Italy induces a significant reduction of total weekly physical activity energy expenditure in all age groups and especially in men, and this reduction negatively affects the psychological well-being.</p>
        <p>In fact, physical activity has a profoundly positive impact on psychological health, by enhancing self-esteem and resilience to stress and reducing depression and anxiety. Given the spread of COVID-19, stay at home is a fundamental step to halt the pandemic. However, the clinical relevance of the present study denotes that maintaining regular physical activity is an important preventive strategy for physical and mental health during a forced rest period like the current coronavirus emergency. Then "stay active to feel better".In fact, physical activity has a profoundly positive impact on psychological health, by enhancing self-esteem and resilience to stress and reducing depression and anxiety.
