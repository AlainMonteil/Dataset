        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is of a scale not seen since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Although the predominant clinical presentation is with respiratory disease, neurological manifestations are being recognised increasingly. Based on knowledge of other coronaviruses, especially those that caused the SARS and MERS epidemics, we might expect to see rare cases of central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is of a scale not seen since the 1918 influenza pandemic.

        <p>A growing number of case reports and series describe a wide array of neurological manifestations, but many lack detail, reflecting the challenge of studying such patients. Encephalopathy is relatively common, being reported for 16 (7.5%) of 214 hospitalised COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, and 40 (69%) of 58 in intensive care with COVID-19 in France. Encephalitis has been described in 8 patients to date, and Guillain-Barré syndrome in 19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 is detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of some patients. Anosmia and ageusia are common and may occur in the absence of other clinical features. Unexpectedly, acute cerebrovascular disease is also emerging as an important complication, reported for 88 patients, mostly with ischaemic stroke, and possibly due to a pro-inflammatory hypercoagulable state with elevated CRP, D-dimer, and ferritin.A growing number of case reports and series describe a wide array of neurological manifestations, but many lack detail, reflecting the challenge of studying such patients.

        <p>Where next? Careful clinical, diagnostic and epidemiological studies are needed to help define the manifestations and burden of neurological disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Precise case definitions must be used to distinguish non-specific complications of severe disease, such as hypoxic encephalopathy and critical care neuropathy, from those caused directly or indirectly by the virus; these include infectious, paraand post-infectious encephalitis, hypercoagulable states leading to stroke, and acute neuropathies such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. Recognising SARS-CoV-2 neurological disease in patients whose respiratory infection is mild or asymptomatic may prove challenging, especially if the primary COVID-19 illness occurred weeks earlier. The proportion of infections leading to neurological disease will remain small. However, these patients may be left with severe neurological sequelae. With so much of the population infected, the overall number of neurological patients, and their associated health, social and economic costs, may be large. Healthcare planners and policymakers must prepare for this eventuality.Where next?

        <p>As of 19 th May 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in more than 4.8 million confirmed cases worldwide, and more than 300,000 deaths. It is the largest and most serious pandemic since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Whilst the most common and important presentation is with respiratory disease, there are increasing reports of neurological features. These appear to be a combination of non-specific complications of systemic disease, or infection and/or inflammation of the nervous system and vasculature, which may be para-or postinfectious. In this rapid review, we consider which neurological manifestations might be expected for COVID -19, given what we know about related coronaviruses and respiratory viruses more broadly; we summarize the evidence to date for COVID-19, and examine putative disease mechanisms; finally, we suggest a framework for investigating patients with suspected COVID-19 neurological disease to support clinico-epidemiological, disease mechanism and treatment studies.As of 19 th May 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in more than 4.8 million confirmed cases worldwide, and more than 300,000 deaths.

        <p>Before SARS-CoV-2, six coronaviruses were known to infect humans. Four that cause seasonal, predominantly mild respiratory illness have a high incidence globally, accounting for about 15-30% of upper respiratory tract infections. 1 Two have led to major epidemics with deaths principally from respiratory disease; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was caused by SARS-CoV in 2002-3 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) by MERS-CoV in 2012. 2,3 Both the more innocuous coronaviruses and these epidemic strains have been associated with occasional disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS).Before SARS-CoV-2, six coronaviruses were known to infect humans.

        <p>Both CNS and PNS disease were reported following SARS (appendix, page 10-11). SARS-CoV was detected in CSF by RT-PCR in two of three cases of encephalopathy with seizures; 4,5 it was cultured from brain tissue at autopsy in the third. 6 Four patients with severe SARS developed neuromuscular disease, predominantly motor neuropathy, myopathy, or both, 7 which may have been SARS-specific or secondary to critical illness. 8 CNS involvement was described for five adults with MERS; two had acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), two had cerebrovascular disease, and one had Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis. [9][10][11] Neuropathy was described for 3 patients. 9,11 HCoV-OC43, a seasonal coronavirus, has caused encephalitis in an infant with severe combined immunodeficiency, 12 and ADEM in an older immunocompetent child. 13 Headache, neck stiffness, and seizures were described among 22 children (median age 36 months) with suspected CNS infection and coronavirus IgM antibodies in serum and/or CSF. 14 Ten had a CSF pleiocytosis, and eight had brain imaging abnormalities. All 22 made a full recovery. 14 Neurological complications have been described for other respiratory viruses, particularly seasonal and pandemic influenza. 1 These include acute necrotising encephalopathy associated with mutations in the RANBP2 gene, acute infantile encephalopathy, and acute haemorrhagic leukoencephalopathy and myelopathy in adults. 15,16 The estimated incidence of neurological disorders during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic was 1.2 per 100,000, with children affected more than adults. [17][18][19][20] The 1918 H1N1 "Spanish" influenza pandemic was associated with post-infectious encephalitis lethargica. 21Both CNS and PNS disease were reported following SARS (appendix, page 10-11).

        <p>Although neurological complications are rare in SARS, MERS and COVID-19, the scale of the current pandemic means that even a very small proportion could build up to a large number of cases. Table 1 shows that for SARS and MERS, the minimum prevalence of CNS complications ranged from 0.04% to 0.2% and for PNS complications from 0.05% to 0.16%; the extrapolated number of cases with neurological complications of COVID-19, based on these related viruses, is also shown. Given the 4.8 million cases of COVID-19 globally as of 19 th May 2020, this projects to a total of 1805-9671 patients with CNS, and 2407-7737 with PNS complications. These numbers, which don't include the increasingly important syndromes of stroke-associated COVID-19 infection, will rise as the pandemic continues.Although neurological complications are rare in SARS, MERS and COVID-19, the scale of the current pandemic means that even a very small proportion could build up to a large number of cases.

        <p>As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses there are increasing reports of neurological manifestations (Table 2). These can be considered as direct effects of the virus on the nervous system, para-or post-infectious immune mediated disease, and neurological complications of the systemic effects of COVID-19. The challenges in managing patients with a highly contagious infection, and the overwhelming numbers of cases mean that many early reports lack detail, have limited CSF analysis, imaging or follow up, and appear on non-peer-reviewed websites.As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses there are increasing reports of neurological manifestations (Table 2).

        <p>Encephalitis is inflammation of the brain parenchyma, usually caused by an infection, or the body's immune defences. Although strictly speaking a pathological diagnosis, for practical purposes clinical evidence of brain inflammation is accepted, such as a CSF pleiocytosis, imaging changes or focal abnormalities on electroencephalogram (EEG). Detection of virus in the CSF per se does not diagnose encephalitis if there is no evidence of brain inflammation (Table 3; appendix, page 3). 22 As of 19 th May 2020, eight adults (four women) aged 24-78 (median 62) years have been described who had encephalitis associated with COVID-19, mostly diagnosed through a nasal/nasopharyngeal swab. [23][24][25][26][27][28][29] Neurological features mostly started from the time of respiratory symptom onset to 17 days after, though in one 60-year-old man confusion preceded cough and fever by two days (Figure 2a); 25 two patients had fever only, with no respiratory features. 26,29 The neurological manifestations were typical for encephalitis, with irritability, confusion and reduced consciousness, sometimes associated with seizures; three patients also had neck stiffness [24][25][26] and another had psychotic symptoms. 30 A 40-year-old man developed ataxia, oscillopsia, hiccups and bilateral facial weakness. 27 CSF, reported for six patients showed a pleiocytosis in five, mostly lymphocytic, and was normal in one. Four had CSF PCR performed for SARS-CoV-2, of whom one was positive -a 24-year-old man with encephalitis, minor respiratory symptoms and "ground glass" changes on chest CT, who had a PCR negative respiratory sample. 24 Few publications reported a comprehensive work up for other causes of encephalitis. 30 Brain imaging was normal or had no acute changes for six patients, and showed high signal intensity in two, including temporal lobe changes in one; 23 the patient with ataxia had a cerebellar lesion that extended into the spinal cord. 27 Electroencephalography was performed in five patients. Two had generalised slowing, two had focal abnormalities; one, who presented with psychotic symptoms followed by a seizure, was found to be in non-convulsive status epilepticus. 30 One patient responded quickly to high dose steroids, 25 but for most there was no specific treatment beyond anticonvulsants, antiviral and antibiotic medication.Encephalitis is inflammation of the brain parenchyma, usually caused by an infection, or the body's immune defences.

        <p>There is no specific treatment for SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis. As for other forms of encephalitis, there will be questions around the relative contributions of viral damage and host inflammatory response, and whether corticosteroids might be useful. Clinical trials seem unlikely, given current numbers.There is no specific treatment for SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis.

        <p>Encephalopathy is the syndrome of altered mental status, which can manifest as changed personality, behaviour or consciousness. In encephalopathic SARS-CoV-2 patients, in whom brain inflammation has not been proven, the wide range of other causes to consider includes hypoxia, drugs, toxins, and metabolic derangements (appendix, page 3). 22 The largest study to date, from Wuhan where the pandemic began, described retrospectively 214 patients with COVID-19, of whom 53 had CNS symptoms including dizziness (36 patients, 46.1%), headache (28,35.9%), and impaired consciousness (16, 20.5%), 27 had severe respiratory disease but there was little further detail. 31 In a French series of 58 intensive care patients with COVID-19, 49 had neurological complications, including 40 (69%) with encephalopathy, and 39 (67%) with corticospinal tract signs. 32 MRI in 13 patients showed leptomeningeal enhancement for eight and acute ischemic change for two (see below); CSF examination for 7 patients showed no pleiocytosis. Fifteen (33%) of 45 who had been discharged had a dysexecutive syndrome. In addition to these series, there has been a handful of case reports, including an encephalopathic woman with imaging changes consistent with acute necrotising encephalopathy 23 (Figure 1a) and a fatal case in which viral particles were found in endothelial cells and neural tissue, though there was no indication of whether this was associated with inflammation. 33 There have been several reports of seizures in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Paroxysmal episodes consistent with seizures were described in two infants with no respiratory symptoms but SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab. 34,35 Both made a good recovery. In one series of 168 children hospitalised with COVID-19, seizures were described for five (3%) children, of whom three had preexisting epilepsy and one had previous febrile seizures. 36Encephalopathy is the syndrome of altered mental status, which can manifest as changed personality, behaviour or consciousness.

        <p>ADEM is a syndrome of multifocal demyelination, typically occurring weeks after an infection, which generally presents with focal neurological symptoms often with encephalopathy. 37 Two case reports describe middle-aged women with ADEM and SARS-CoV-2 detected on respiratory swabs. One developed dysphagia, dysarthria and encephalopathy 9 days after onset of headache and myalgia. 38 The other presented with seizures and reduced consciousness and required intubation for respiratory failure. 39 Both had normal CSF and high signal intensities on MRI typical of ADEM. They both improved after treatment, the first with IVIG, the second with steroids. To date there is just a single report of myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord) associated with COVID-19. A 66-year-old man in Wuhan, China developed fever, fatigue and then acute flaccid paraparesis with incontinence. Examination demonstrated hyporeflexia and a sensory level at T10. He was treated with dexamethasone and IVIG and was discharged for rehabilitation. 40 ADEM and myelitis, usually considered post-infectious diseases, are treated typically with corticosteroids or other immunotherapies. In these para-infectious cases, with SARS-CoV-2 detectable at presentation, clinicians may need to be more cautious, especially if virus is detected in the CSF.ADEM is a syndrome of multifocal demyelination, typically occurring weeks after an infection, which generally presents with focal neurological symptoms often with encephalopathy. 37 Two case reports describe middle-aged women with ADEM and SARS-CoV-2 detected on respiratory swabs.

        <p>As COVID-19 has spread around the world, evidence has grown for an association with cerebrovascular disease, as well as other forms of vascular disease. There were cerebrovascular manifestations for 13 (5.9%) of 221 COVID-19 patients in an early retrospective case series from Wuhan: 11 (5%) developed ischaemic stroke, one (0•5%) had intracerebral haemorrhage, and one (0•5%) cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. 41 In Brescia, Italy 43 (77%) of 56 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients admitted to one neurology unit had cerebrovascular disease: 35 ischaemic and three haemorrhagic stroke, and five with transient ischaemic attacks. 42 In total 88 patients with ischaemic and 8 with haemorrhagic stroke [41][42][43][44][45] have been reported, 18 (19%) of who died (Table 2; appendix, pages 12-22) Most patients were over 60 years old, many with known risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, especially hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, and vascular disease. 41,[45][46][47][48] Younger stroke patients have also been reported. 43,47,[49][50][51] In one New York hospital, five young stroke patients with SARS-CoV2 were admitted in just two weeks, whereas the average number of young stroke admissions per two weeks in the preceding year was 0•73. 51 Two had no other symptoms of COVID-19. All had large vessel ischaemic strokes. Cerebrovascular symptoms began a median (range) of 9•5 (0-33) days after the onset of respiratory illness, though in one patient the stroke preceded reparatory features, 31 and in five there were only cerebrovascular symptoms. 43,48,49,51 In a couple of patients, ischaemic stroke has been associated with thrombus in the aorta, 49,52 and indeed multiple infarcts have been reported for these and other patients, 46,47,53 sometimes associated with arterial thrombosis and limb ischaemia. 46,53 Concurrent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism has been found for other stroke patients. 47,49 Arterial and venous imaging is clearly essential for COVID-19 patients with acute cerebrovascular events. Small asymptomatic infarcts identified on MRI only have also been described. 32 Blood D-dimer concentration was raised in many COVID-19 stroke patients, consistent with a pro-inflammatory, coagulopathic state in the setting of critical illness. 41,[45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52] Positive lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin and anti-β2glycoprotein-1 antibodies have also been reported in COVID-19 associated stroke, 46 47 though these can be raised in other critical illness, including infections.As COVID-19 has spread around the world, evidence has grown for an association with cerebrovascular disease, as well as other forms of vascular disease.

        <p>Immediate anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin has been recommended for COVID-19 patients, to reduce the risk of thrombotic disease. 54 This might also reduce COVID-19-associated ischaemic stroke, but it must be balanced against the risk of intracranial haemorrhage, including haemorrhagic transformation of an acute infarct. Several randomised controlled trials are looking at the role of anticoagulation in COVID-19 patients, including the impact on stroke incidence.Immediate anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin has been recommended for COVID-19 patients, to reduce the risk of thrombotic disease. 54 This might also reduce COVID-19-associated ischaemic stroke, but it must be balanced against the risk of intracranial haemorrhage, including haemorrhagic transformation of an acute infarct.

        <p>Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute polyradiculopathy characterized by rapidly progressive symmetrical limb weakness, with sensory symptoms, and areflexia, with or without facial weakness, though there are several variants.

For the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections world-wide, incidence is not particularly above what might be expected. 55 Neurological symptoms started typically 7 (range -7-24) days after respiratory or systemic features (Figure 2a), although two patients developed febrile illness 7 days after the onset of GBS; 56,57 on hospital admission one had a positive swab for SARS-CoV-2, and the other had lymphocytopenia and thrombocytopenia, characteristic for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Three patients had diarrhoea before the onset of neurological disease.Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute polyradiculopathy characterized by rapidly progressive symmetrical limb weakness, with sensory symptoms, and areflexia, with or without facial weakness, though there are several variants.

        <p>Viral entry to the brain via the olfactory bulb, the only part of the CNS not protected by dura, is one plausible route for SARS-CoV-2, especially given the anosmia in COVID-19. This is thought to be a route of entry for herpes simplex virus, the most common cause of sporadic viral encephalitis. 78 In mouse models, following intranasal injection HCoV-OC43 invades the CNS by the olfactory route. 79 Alternative entry routes include carriage across the blood brain barrier, following viraemia, or via infected leukocytes. 1 The angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor, which SARS-CoV-2 binds to for entry into cells, 80 is found in brain vascular endothelium and smooth muscle. 81 SARS-CoV-2 replicates in neuronal cells in vitro. 82 Damage within the CNS or PNS may be caused directly by virus or by the body's innate and adaptive immune responses to infection. Data so far do not suggest that SARS-CoV-2 or related coronaviruses are highly neurovirulent, unlike herpes simplex virus, some enteroviruses and some arthropodborne viruses, which can cause rampant destruction of neurons. 78 Autopsy material from a patient who developed encephalopathy weeks after presenting with SARS showed oedema, neuronal necrosis and broad gliocyte hyperplasia. 6 Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated SARS-CoV in the brain was associated with elevated expression of monokine induced by interferon-g (Mig) and infiltration of monocytes/macrophages plus T lymphocytes. These findings are consistent with viral CNS entry triggering infiltration of immune cells and cytokine/chemokine release, which contributed to tissue damage.Viral entry to the brain via the olfactory bulb, the only part of the CNS not protected by dura, is one plausible route for SARS-CoV-2, especially given the anosmia in COVID-19.

        <p>Early indicators suggest cerebrovascular disease in COVID-19 may be due to a coagulopathy. SARS-CoV-2 can cause damage to endothelial cells activating inflammatory and thrombotic pathways. 84 Endothelial cell infection and/or monocyte activation, upregulation of tissue factors, and the release of microparticles activating the thrombotic pathway and causing microangiopathy may occur for SARS-CoV-2, as for other viruses. 85,86 The latter is postulated to represent part of the secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis spectrum described in severe COVID-19. 87 Thrombocytopenia with elevated D-dimer and CRP in severe COVID-19 and stroke are consistent with a virus-associated microangiopathic process. 41 Endothelial dysfunction can potentially lead to micro-and macrovascular, arterial and potentially venous complications in the brain, as described systemically. 88 Acute ischaemic stroke may also occur through the early inflammatory process following acute infection destabilising a carotid plaque or triggering atrial fibrillation. 89 A vasculitis process similar to that for varicella zoster virus, where viral replication in the cerebral arterial wall triggers local inflammation, 90 is also plausible: endothelial infection by SARS-CoV-2 with inflammation and apoptosis of endothelial cells has been shown in kidney, heart, bowel and lung at autopsy, 84 but cerebral vessels have not yet been investigated.Early indicators suggest cerebrovascular disease in COVID-19 may be due to a coagulopathy.

        <p>As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread, and patients with neurological symptoms are seen increasingly, it is essential that the desire to publish quickly is balanced with the need for careful clinical, diagnostic and epidemiological studies.

        <p>In patients with neuropathy, cerebrovascular disease or ADEM, where the damage is likely caused by host response to viral infection, establishing causality is even more challenging, especially if patients present after virus has cleared from the nasopharynx. Clinical case definitions for COVID-19, based on the history and typical findings for chest imaging and blood investigations (Table 3) will be useful. For stroke patients, consider cerebral angiography, intracranial vessel wall imaging and, if necessary, brain biopsy, looking for vasculitis. The apparent high incidence of cerebrovascular disease in patients with COVID-19, with predominantly large vessel disease and markers of a highly prothrombotic state, suggest a causal relationship. However, the high prevalence of the virus during the pandemic, and the fact that most stroke patients have other risk factors, mean it is hard to be sure about causation. The link with SARS-CoV-2 may ultimately need to be proven by careful casecontrol studies.In patients with neuropathy, cerebrovascular disease or ADEM, where the damage is likely caused by host response to viral infection, establishing causality is even more challenging, especially if patients present after virus has cleared from the nasopharynx.
