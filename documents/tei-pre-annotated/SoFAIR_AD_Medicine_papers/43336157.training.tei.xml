        <p>Nutrient availability is the major regulator of life and reproduction, and a complex cellular signaling network has evolved to adapt organisms to fasting. These sensor pathways monitor cellular energy metabolism, especially mitochondrial ATP production and NAD + /NADH ratio, as major signals for nutritional state. We hypothesized that these signals would be modified by mitochondrial respiratory chain disease, because of inefficient NADH utilization and ATP production. Oral administration of nicotinamide riboside (NR), a vitamin B3 and NAD + precursor, was previously shown to boost NAD + levels in mice and to induce mitochondrial biogenesis. Here, we treated mitochondrial myopathy mice with NR. This vitamin effectively delayed early-and late-stage disease progression, by robustly inducing mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissue, preventing mitochondrial ultrastructure abnormalities and mtDNA deletion formation. NR further stimulated mitochondrial unfolded protein response, suggesting its protective role in mitochondrial disease. These results indicate that NR and strategies boosting NAD + levels are a promising treatment strategy for mitochondrial myopathy.Nutrient availability is the major regulator of life and reproduction, and a complex cellular signaling network has evolved to adapt organisms to fasting.

        <p>Mitochondrial disorders, caused by respiratory chain deficiency (RCD), are the most common form of inherited metabolic disorders and manifest with exceptional clinical variability (Ylikallio &amp; Suomalainen, 2011). Despite their progressive and often fatal outcome, no curative treatment is available. Therapy trials for these diseases are mostly hampered by heterogeneity of the disease manifestations and the consequent lack of patient groups with homogenous genetic background and clinical presentations (Suomalainen, 2011). Development of mouse models replicating mitochondrial disease phenotypes has provided a unique opportunity both for therapeutic trials and for detailed studies of molecular pathophysiology of primary mitochondrial dysfunction.Mitochondrial disorders, caused by respiratory chain deficiency (RCD), are the most common form of inherited metabolic disorders and manifest with exceptional clinical variability (Ylikallio &amp; Suomalainen, 2011).

        <p>We have previously generated Deletor mice, with adult-onset mitochondrial myopathy (MM) (Tyynismaa et al, 2005). These mice carry a dominant patient mutation in mitochondrial replicative helicase Twinkle, resulting in progressive MM after 12 months of age, with the accumulation of multiple mtDNA deletions in their skeletal muscle and brain, leading to a subtle progressive respiratory chain deficiency (Zeviani et al, 1989;Suomalainen et al, 1992;Tyynismaa et al, 2005). These mice have a normal lifespan and physical performance despite typical morphological changes in MM, cytochrome c oxidase (COX)-negative fibers, and ultrastructural mitochondrial abnormalities, in their muscle. The histological and physiological findings in Deletors mimic closely those of patients with the same mutation (Suomalainen et al, 1992(Suomalainen et al, , 1997)), making Deletor mice an optimal model for therapy trials.We have previously generated Deletor mice, with adult-onset mitochondrial myopathy (MM) (Tyynismaa et al, 2005).

        <p>We found that RCD in Deletor muscles induced a pseudostarvation response, despite normal food intake, with wide induction of genes with the ATF transcription factor-binding sites in their upstream regulatory regions (Tyynismaa et al, 2010). One of these genes was FGF21, encoding a fasting cytokine and leading to increased blood FGF21 concentration and consequent fat mobilization from adipose tissue and liver (Kharitonenkov et al, 2005), without, however, activation of fasting-related beta oxidation or mitochondrial biogenesis. This suggested that RCD induces only some fasting-related pathways, raising the question whether such conflicting signaling, partially promoting catabolism, partially anabolism, could contribute to disease progression. In C. elegans, ATFs have been linked to mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR mt ) (Nargund et al, 2012), induced by mitochondrial proteostasis, activating ClpP protease (Haynes et al, 2007(Haynes et al, , 2013)), leading to ATF relocalization to nucleus and induction of UPR mt -associated gene expression (e.g., mitochondrial heat shock proteins, HSPs). The MM-linked pseudo-starvation response with potential links to UPR mt strongly supported the involvement of abnormal nutrient signaling in the disease process.We found that RCD in Deletor muscles induced a pseudostarvation response, despite normal food intake, with wide induction of genes with the ATF transcription factor-binding sites in their upstream regulatory regions (Tyynismaa et al, 2010).

        <p>Nutrient sensors Sirt1 and AMPK monitor tissue NAD + /NADH and AMP/ATP ratios, respectively. If these ratios increased, the sensors induce a metabolic fasting response, boosting mitochondrial biogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and oxidative ATP production (Imai et al, 2000;Rodgers et al, 2005;Canto et al, 2009Canto et al, , 2012)). We hypothesized that RCD reduces NADH utilization, decreasing NAD + /NADH and signaling for high nutrient availability, leaving Sirt1 inactive and attenuating mitochondrial biogenesis. However, RCD also decreases ATP production, increasing AMP/ATP, signaling for low nutrition availability, and leading to a potential conflict in nutrient sensor activation and a partial pseudo-starvation response (Nunnari &amp; Suomalainen, 2012). Previous treatment trials of RC-deficient mice have indicated that activation of mitochondrial biogenesis may be beneficial: High-fat diet (Ahola-Erkkila et al, 2010), PPAR (Wenz et al, 2008;Yatsuga &amp; Suomalainen, 2011) and AMPK agonists (Viscomi et al, 2011) all delayed disease progression. Recently, nicotinamide riboside (NR), a vitamin B3-analogue and NAD + precursor, was shown to promote oxidative metabolism in mice by increasing NAD + /NADH (Bieganowski &amp; Brenner, 2004;Canto et al, 2012). Furthermore, NAD + precursors improved mitochondrial function in aging mice to mimic that of young mice, in SIRT1-dependent manner (Gomes et al, 2013).

        <p>We administered 400 mg/kg/day of NR, or chow diet (CD), for two groups of male Deletor and control mice (Yang et al, 2007;Canto et al, 2012): "pre-manifestation" (12 months at initiation, 16 months at termination), to test whether early NR treatment can prevent MM, and "post-manifestation" (17 months at initiation, 21 months at termination), to test whether NR can affect the progression of an already-manifested disease. The control groups received similar chow diet without NR. The dose and study protocol were exactly as published previously (Canto et al, 2012), because they showed that this dose of NR efficiently increased NAD + in skeletal muscle.We administered 400 mg/kg/day of NR, or chow diet (CD), for two groups of male Deletor and control mice (Yang et al, 2007;Canto et al, 2012): "pre-manifestation" (12 months at initiation, 16 months at termination), to test whether early NR treatment can prevent MM, and "post-manifestation" (17 months at initiation, 21 months at termination), to test whether NR can affect the progression of an already-manifested disease.

        <p>We first analyzed the NAD + content of Deletor mouse muscle, to clarify whether respiratory chain deficiency affected this pool. Very old Deletor mice, from 23 to 27 months of age, showed a decreasing trend in their skeletal muscle (Fig 1A), whereas younger mice of 17-21 months showed a variation in their NAD + levels with no clear decrease (Supplementary Fig S1). These results suggest that NAD + pool was progressively depleted upon mitochondrial myopathy progression.We first analyzed the NAD + content of Deletor mouse muscle, to clarify whether respiratory chain deficiency affected this pool.

        <p>After 16 weeks of NR treatment, the amount of muscle fibers with decreased cytochrome c oxidase activity (COX-negative), a hallmark of MM and a measure of disease progression, was significantly lower in quadriceps femoris muscle (QF) of both preand post-manifestation Deletors compared to the CD-fed Deletors. The post-manifestation Deletors on NR diet showed 1.8-fold less, and pre-manifestation mice 1.5-fold less, COX-negative fibers than Deletors on CD (Fig 1B). The wild-type littermates showed no COXnegative fibers. The overall histochemical COX activity in both oxidative and non-oxidative muscle fibers was increased in all mice receiving NR (Fig 1C ), and the amounts of oxidative phosphorylation enzymes having mtDNA-encoded subunits, especially ATPase, were increased (Fig 1D -H). Multiple mtDNA deletions in the Deletor mouse accumulate in the skeletal muscle along with MM progression and are thought to underlie RCD in both mice and men (Zeviani et al, 1989;Suomalainen et al, 1992;Tyynismaa et al, 2005). Consistent with a decrease in COX-negative fibers, both NR-fed Deletor groups had significantly lower mtDNA deletion load in QF than CD-fed Deletors (Fig 1I andJ), indicating that their accumulation in Deletor tissues was considerably slowed down. NR treatment increased mtDNA copy number in QF of WT mice, and mtDNA amount also trended upwards in Deletors (Fig 1K). Citrate synthase activity indicated an significantly increased mitochondrial mass in all NR-fed mice (Fig 1L). These results demonstrate that NR induced mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative ATP production capacity robustly and significantly delayed the progression of MM, irrespective of the disease stage.After 16 weeks of NR treatment, the amount of muscle fibers with decreased cytochrome c oxidase activity (COX-negative), a hallmark of MM and a measure of disease progression, was significantly lower in quadriceps femoris muscle (QF) of both preand post-manifestation Deletors compared to the CD-fed Deletors.

        <p>The electron microscopic examination of skeletal muscle ultrastructure on CD showed swollen mitochondria increased in number, with distorted cristae and subsarcolemmal accumulations, accompanied by myofibrillar degeneration and autophagosomes, especially evident in oxidative, but also in glycolytic fibers (Fig 2A -C), similar to previously reported in MM patients (Suomalainen et al, 1992). On NR diet, the Deletor and WT mice showed a remarkable induction of mitochondrial biogenesis, with an increase in the amount and volume of intermyofibrillar and subsarcolemmal mitochondria ( (Suomalainen et al, 1992;Tyynismaa et al, 2005). This suggests that liver phenotype is secondary to metabolic signals induced by RCD in the skeletal muscle and BAT. NR, however, increased mtDNA copy number in WT (Fig 3O) and changed ultrastructure of rough endoplasmic reticulum, showing close association of the membranes with mitochondria and a suggestive increase in ribosomes on mitochondria in both Deletor and WT (Fig 3Q andS). These findings suggest the induction of metabolic activity in the liver. NR did not clearly affect mtDNA deletion load or copy number in the Deletor brain (Supplementary Fig S4B andC). Whether NR crosses the blood-brain barrier remains to be confirmed (Canto et al, 2012).The electron microscopic examination of skeletal muscle ultrastructure on CD showed swollen mitochondria increased in number, with distorted cristae and subsarcolemmal accumulations, accompanied by myofibrillar degeneration and autophagosomes, especially evident in oxidative, but also in glycolytic fibers (Fig 2A -C), similar to previously reported in MM patients (Suomalainen et al, 1992).

        <p>NR enhanced FOXO1 deacetylation, suggesting SIRT1 activation NR had many beneficial effects on morphological hallmarks of MM and has previously been shown to boost tissue NAD + levels as well as Sirt1 activity, as measured by FOXO1 deacetylation (Brunet et al, 2004;Canto et al, 2012). The steady-state NAD + levels showed an increasing trend in mouse livers and muscle after 16 weeks of NR diet, but these steady-state changes after long-term diet were subtle (Supplementary Fig S1A andB). However, NR significantly decreased the acetylated inactive form of FOXO1 in both Deletor and WT mouse muscle and increased the total amount of FOXO1 in Deletors (Fig 4A -C). These results support the induction of NAD + -stimulated Sirt1 deacetylase function. Activation of fatty acid beta oxidation was suggested by increased mRNA expression levels of long-chain fatty acid transport receptor, CD36, and two enzymes of fatty acid oxidation pathway, ACOX1 and MCAD (Fig 4D -F). These results suggest that NR was capable of activating NAD + -responsive sirtuin signaling and downstream mitochondrial biogenesis.NR enhanced FOXO1 deacetylation, suggesting SIRT1 activation NR had many beneficial effects on morphological hallmarks of MM and has previously been shown to boost tissue NAD + levels as well as Sirt1 activity, as measured by FOXO1 deacetylation (Brunet et al, 2004;Canto et al, 2012).

        <p>RCD induced mitochondrial unfolded protein response and is further enhanced by NR UPR mt has been suggested to be beneficial for health and lifespan (Houtkooper et al, 2010;Mouchiroud et al, 2013) and to overlap with RCD-induced pseudo-starvation response (Tyynismaa et al, 2010;Suomalainen et al, 2011;Nunnari &amp; Suomalainen, 2012). Of note, we show here that Deletors on CD show the induction of HSP60, HSP70, and ClpP expression, as well as the AARE-regulated FGF21 (Fig 4G and H), indicating that RCD induces UPR mt through mechanisms that are conserved between worms and mammals (Durieux et al, 2011;Houtkooper et al, 2013). NR further increased UPR mt protein amounts. These results indicate that UPR mt is induced by RCD and suggest that NAD + /NADH contributes to UPR mt induction.RCD induced mitochondrial unfolded protein response and is further enhanced by NR UPR mt has been suggested to be beneficial for health and lifespan (Houtkooper et al, 2010;Mouchiroud et al, 2013) and to overlap with RCD-induced pseudo-starvation response (Tyynismaa et al, 2010;Suomalainen et al, 2011;Nunnari &amp; Suomalainen, 2012).

        <p>Mitochondrial myopathy is one of the most common manifestations of adult-onset mitochondrial disorders (Ylikallio &amp; Suomalainen, 2011) and is progressive in nature. Currently, only palliative care can be offered to the patients. We demonstrate here that oral supplementation with NR, a vitamin B3 form and NAD + precursor, efficiently prevented development and progression of mitochondrial myopathy in mice. NR delayed the development of morphological hallmarks and ultrastructural changes in mitochondria and resulted in a remarkable induction of mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism, with an increase in mitochondrial mass, mtDNA, and respiratory chain protein amounts in the muscle. Moreover, NR-fed Deletors showed less mutant mtDNA than their CD-fed littermates, which could be a result of decreased generation of mtDNA deletions or their increased clearance. We show that NR significantly delayed disease progression even in mice that already manifested the disease, which is the time, when medical treatment would typically be started for patients. These results are remarkable, as they underline the utmost importance of specific vitamin cofactors as modifiers of metabolism in disease, and emphasize the role of nutritional signaling in the pathogenesis of adult-onset mitochondrial disorders.Mitochondrial myopathy is one of the most common manifestations of adult-onset mitochondrial disorders (Ylikallio &amp; Suomalainen, 2011) and is progressive in nature.

        <p>Mitochondrial biogenesis induction as a treatment strategy was first proposed by Moraes group as their chemical or transgenic induction of PGC1alpha transcription coactivator in severe mitochondrial COX deficiency improved RC function and delayed death of the mice (Wenz et al, 2008). These findings were replicated in other models of mitochondrial dysfunction (Viscomi et al, 2011;Yatsuga &amp; Suomalainen, 2011). The link to nutritional signaling was underlined by the improvement of mitochondrial pathology after high-fat diet (Ahola-Erkkila et al, 2010) and treatment by AMPK agonist AICAR (Viscomi et al, 2011) or rapamycin (Johnson et al, 2013). In wild-type mice, using an identical treatment protocol as ours, NR was recently shown to increase tissue NAD + levels and to induce FOXO1 deacetylation, indicating the activation of Sirt1 deacetylase (Canto et al, 2012). As Canto et al, we found in MM mice signs of sirtuin activation after NR treatment. NR induced FOXO1 deacetylation, which points to Sirt1 activation. The sirtuin-mediated fasting response has potential to activate the downstream target PGC1alpha and mitochondrial biogenesis. This mechanism may underlie the slowed-down disease progression. These findings propose that similar consequences on mitochondrial biogenesis, which have been previously obtained by pharmacological induction of PGC1alpha, can be achieved by vitamin B3 supplementation.Mitochondrial biogenesis induction as a treatment strategy was first proposed by Moraes group as their chemical or transgenic induction of PGC1alpha transcription coactivator in severe mitochondrial COX deficiency improved RC function and delayed death of the mice (Wenz et al, 2008).

        <p>The role of BAT in mitochondrial disease is a little studied field. Patients with a specific mtDNA mutation, m.8344A&gt;G, show multiple symmetric lipomas, which have recently been reported to contain UCP1-positive adipocytes, typical for BAT (Plummer et al, 2013). This observation suggested that mitochondrial dysfunction may affect BAT differentiation or function, but the mechanisms involved are unknown. Cold stimulus activates BAT and results in increased oxygen consumption. We found that Deletors responded to cold by increasing their oxygen consumption and CO 2 production, but not to similar level as their wild-type littermates, which suggested BAT dysfunction. Indeed, the Deletors showed multiple mtDNA deletions in BAT, and their mitochondrial ultrastructure showed low crista content and matrix density. NR has been previously shown to induce mitochondrial biogenesis in BAT of normal mice (Canto et al, 2012). NR effectively cured both the response to cold and mitochondrial ultrastructural abnormalities in Deletors. BAT is an active metabolic organ in mice, but recent years have shown that BAT activity also in humans contributes to lipid metabolism (Virtanen et al, 2013). Our results, indicating decreased BAT function in MM, suggest that the tissue may contribute to mitochondrial disease manifestations.The role of BAT in mitochondrial disease is a little studied field.

        <p>UPR mt has been suggested to be beneficial for health and lifespan (Houtkooper et al, 2010;Mouchiroud et al, 2013). We show here that the partial pseudo-starvation response initiated by RCD in skeletal muscle of MM mice shares key components of UPR mt , previously characterized in detail in C. elegans (Haynes et al, 2007(Haynes et al, , 2013;;Durieux et al, 2011), and not before known to be involved in disease. Therefore, the RCD-induced UPR mt involves mechanisms that are conserved between worms and mammals. Importantly, NR further enhanced UPR mt , supporting the previous finding that NAD + /NADH contributes to UPR mt induction (Mouchiroud et al, 2013), although it is not the sole required signal. Furthermore, improved mitochondrial ultrastructure and function by NR, along with enhanced UPR mt , suggests that UPR mt induction is protective for MM.UPR mt has been suggested to be beneficial for health and lifespan (Houtkooper et al, 2010;Mouchiroud et al, 2013).

        <p>We have previously described that fasting cytokine FGF21 is a potential biomarker for mitochondrial myopathies (Suomalainen et al, 2011), driven by an upstream regulatory AARE element (Tyynismaa et al, 2010). Here, we link FGF21 (Kharitonenkov et al, 2005) to be part of UPR mt . NR further induced UPR mt and FGF21, while COX-negative fiber amount decreased. Therefore, we propose that FGF21 is a serum biomarker of skeletal muscle UPR mt , and part of the pseudo-starvation response induced by RCD, which signals and conveys the local mitochondrial activity and metabolic situation of muscle to the whole organism. FGF21 is a valuable marker for diagnostic use of disorders associated with UPR mt . However, upon interventions with NAD + precursors, or treatment trials enhancing UPR mt , also FGF21 would be induced, and in those situations, FGF21 serum concentrations may not reflect muscle treatment response. Our data suggest that conflicting nutrient signaling is integral for MM pathogenesis and disease progression. We show that fine tuning of cellular signaling with vitamin cofactors, especially NAD + precursors, is an intriguing and straightforward therapeutic strategy that should be explored in patients with late-onset mitochondrial myopathy, the most common type of adult-onset mitochondrial disorders.We have previously described that fasting cytokine FGF21 is a potential biomarker for mitochondrial myopathies (Suomalainen et al, 2011), driven by an upstream regulatory AARE element (Tyynismaa et al, 2010).

        <p>All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines by ethical board of State Provincial Office for Animal Experimentation of Finland. The Deletor mouse model was generated in C57BL/6 congenic background and has been previously characterized (Tyynismaa et al, 2005); WT mice were littermates from the same congenic mouse strain C57BL/6. Deletor and WT male mice were administered either CD diet (rodent diet with 11% fat, 65% carbohydrate, 24% protein of total calorie content, Altromin Spezialfutter GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Germany) or NR diet (rodent diet as CD, supplemented with 0.24% of NR). NR was custom-synthesized as previously described (Yang et al, 2007) and was kindly provided by Amazentis and Merck Research laboratories. The food pellets were manually prepared by baking NR into the powdered food as described previously (Canto et al, 2012), and the protocol followed this published protocol in detail. The pellets were stored at À20°C. During the intervention, the mice were regularly monitored for weight, food consumption, and physical endurance. Their exercise capability was measured twice by treadmill exercise test (Exer-6M Treadmill, Columbus Instrument) at the start and the end of the diet. The exercise test protocol consisted of the initial running speed of 7 m/s, which was increased every 2 min with 2 m/s and continued until the animal was unable to run or repeatedly fell from the belt at the stimulus site.All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines by ethical board of State Provincial Office for Animal Experimentation of Finland.

        <p>Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production, as well as spontaneous moving and feeding activities, were recorded by Oxymax Lab Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS; Columbus Instruments, OH, USA). The mice were kept in individual cages inside a CLAMS chamber for 3 days; the first day and night was a nonrecording adjustment period followed by a 24-h recording at room temperature (+22°C) and a 6-h cold exposure (+4°C). Measurements were performed for a total of 18 Deletor mice (n = 8 on NR and n = 10 on CD) and six WT mice (n = 3 on NR and n = 3 on CD) belonging to the post-manifestation group and for four Deletor mice (n = 2 on NR and n = 2 on CD) and four WT mice (n = 2 on NR and n = 2 on CD) from the pre-manifestation group. The results of O 2 consumption and CO 2 production were used to calculate respiratory exchange rate and analyzed separately from the light (inactive) and dark (active) periods of the day and from the cold exposure.Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production, as well as spontaneous moving and feeding activities, were recorded by Oxymax Lab Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS; Columbus Instruments, OH, USA).

        <p>Tissue sections were prepared from QF, liver, and BAT. Samples were embedded with OCT Compound Embedding Medium (Tissue-Tek) and snap-frozen in 2-methylbutane in liquid nitrogen. Frozen sections (12 lm) from QF were assayed for in situ histochemical COX and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activities simultaneously. From QF sections, COX-negative and COX-negative plus SDHpositive and normal fibers were calculated. Approximately 2000 fibers were counted from each mouse sample. The intensity of COX histochemical activity from QF for both oxidative and non-oxidative fibers was measured with

        <p>Mitochondrial disorders are the most common cause of inherited metabolic disease of adults and children, with no means of cure. Physiological studies utilizing mouse models have suggested that energy metabolic defect in adult muscle is interpreted by some cellular pathways as a state of starvation, despite normal nutrition, leading to "pseudo-starvation" response. One of the cellular mediators for this response is the ratio of oxidized (NAD + ) to reduced (NADH) nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Vitamin B3 is a direct precursor of NAD + . We asked here whether increasing cellular NAD + levels by a vitamin B3 form, nicotinamide riboside (NR), could alleviate pathological changes upon mitochondrial myopathy (MM) or delay disease progression.Mitochondrial disorders are the most common cause of inherited metabolic disease of adults and children, with no means of cure.

        <p>We report that per-oral NR, a vitamin B3 form and NAD + precursor, effectively delayed mouse MM progression. NR robustly induced mitochondrial mass and function and cured structural abnormalities of mitochondria, as well as delayed accumulation of mitochondrial DNA mutations. We show here that MM pseudo-starvation response is linked with a protective stress response, mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), with induction of fasting cytokine FGF21. NR further enhanced UPRmt, supporting a protective role of UPRmt upon MM.We report that per-oral NR, a vitamin B3 form and NAD + precursor, effectively delayed mouse MM progression.
