        <p>Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality worldwide, 1 contributing to over 8.7 million deaths globally in 2015. 2 Cancer incidence is increasing due, in part, to higher morbidity from chronic diseases and epidemiological transitions in developing countries. 3 This increase highlights the importance of identifying prognostic indicators associated with cancer progression such as the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR). 4 The link between inflammation and cancer was first observed by Rudolf Virchow, who detected leukocytes within tumours and hypothesized that inflammation increased cellular proliferation. 5 Since this discovery in the 19 th century, inflammation has been recognised as one of the six biological capabilities of tumour development and a hallmark of cancer, 6 with links to cancer initiation, progression and metastasis. 7 The paradoxical role of neutrophils in both the prevention and facilitation of tumour progression has generated significant research interest around neutrophils in the tumour microenvironment. 8 The NLR has emerged as a potential biomarker of cancer prognosis and is of particular clinical interest due to its accessibility and the ease of calculating the ratio from patients' routine blood cell counts. 9 The NLR was first recognised for its association with systemic inflammation in the critically ill and meta-analyses on the association between elevated NLR and poor prognosis have reported a wide range of effect sizes, depending on the site of cancer. 9,10 The close association between inflammation and cancer progression hints at the potential of elevated tumour-associated neutrophils (TAN), or neutrophils which infiltrate tumours, 11 as a prognostic biomarker. 8,12,13 Many systematic reviews and meta-analyses have explored the association between neutrophils and cancer prognosis. However, the myriad of different cancer sites, stages, treatments, survival outcomes and cut-off values for classifying a "high" NLR complicates the interpretation of this body of evidence.Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality worldwide, 1 contributing to over 8.7 million deaths globally in 2015. 2 Cancer incidence is increasing due, in part, to higher morbidity from chronic diseases and epidemiological transitions in developing countries. 3 This increase highlights the importance of identifying prognostic indicators associated with cancer progression such as the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR). 4 The link between inflammation and cancer was first observed by Rudolf Virchow, who detected leukocytes within tumours and hypothesized that inflammation increased cellular proliferation. 5 Since this discovery in the 19 th century, inflammation has been recognised as one of the six biological capabilities of tumour development and a hallmark of cancer, 6 with links to cancer initiation, progression and metastasis. 7 The paradoxical role of neutrophils in both the prevention and facilitation of tumour progression has generated significant research interest around neutrophils in the tumour microenvironment. 8 The NLR has emerged as a potential biomarker of cancer prognosis and is of particular clinical interest due to its accessibility and the ease of calculating the ratio from patients' routine blood cell counts. 9 The NLR was first recognised for its association with systemic inflammation in the critically ill and meta-analyses on the association between elevated NLR and poor prognosis have reported a wide range of effect sizes, depending on the site of cancer. 9,10 The close association between inflammation and cancer progression hints at the potential of elevated tumour-associated neutrophils (TAN), or neutrophils which infiltrate tumours, 11 as a prognostic biomarker. 8,12,13 Many systematic reviews and meta-analyses have explored the association between neutrophils and cancer prognosis.

        <p>It is currently unclear how the association between NLR and poor prognosis varies depending on the site of cancer or the treatment considered. Umbrella reviews allow for the analysis of such broad subject areas to examine the strength and credibility of associations using the results of published systematic reviews and meta-analyses. 14,15 Umbrella review methods assess the strength and consistency of the literature to evaluate bias and identify which associations are supported by strong evidence. 14 Here we carried out an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses with the aim of comprehensively evaluating the validity and strength of reported associations between NLR or TAN and cancer prognosis and identify potential biases in relevant literature.It is currently unclear how the association between NLR and poor prognosis varies depending on the site of cancer or the treatment considered.

        <p>Searches were conducted in Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Database (Additional File 1: Appendix A) and aimed to include all systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in English from inception up to 29 May 2020. Measures of neutrophil counts included NLR and TAN (intratumoural, peritumoural and stromal neutrophils). Overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), progression-free survival (PFS), disease-free survival (DFS) and reoccurrence-free survival (RFS) were considered as cancer outcomes. Articles were initially screened by title and abstract to determine eligibility for full text screening and inclusion using RefWorks web-based bibliography and database manager. 16Searches were conducted in Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Database (Additional File 1: Appendix A) and aimed to include all systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in English from inception up to 29 May 2020.

        <p>Included studies were systematic reviews and meta-analyses of individual observational studies in humans with any cancer diagnosis and NLR or TAN measurements taken around the time of diagnosis. Systematic reviews which did not include a meta-analysis were excluded. Meta-analyses were excluded if they did not assess a cancer outcome in our inclusion criteria, included more than one outcome in a single analysis, did not specify the cancer site or included multiple cancer sites in a single analysis without clarifying whether there was a shared feature (e.g. analyses that combined cancers and classified them as "other cancers" without further details). However, meta-analyses which assessed multiple cancers in a single analysis based on a shared feature were included and classified as "composite cancer endpoints". Meta-analyses were also excluded if they did not provide sufficient detail for replication, such as the hazard ratio (HR), 95% confidence interval and total sample size of each individual study included in a meta-analysis. If a single systematic review included multiple meta-analyses, all meta-analyses were individually assessed for eligibility.Included studies were systematic reviews and meta-analyses of individual observational studies in humans with any cancer diagnosis and NLR or TAN measurements taken around the time of diagnosis.

        <p>When more than one meta-analysis was identified for a single association at a specific site, they were assessed for concordance in the direction, magnitude and significance of their effect estimates. If the duplicate meta-analyses identified agreed in significance, magnitude and direction of effect, the meta-analysis with the greatest number of component studies was included. Where disagreement was found, both duplicate meta-analyses were excluded unless the disagreement arose from an underpowered metaanalysis (less than five component studies), in which case the meta-analysis with the greatest number of component studies was used.When more than one meta-analysis was identified for a single association at a specific site, they were assessed for concordance in the direction, magnitude and significance of their effect estimates.

        <p>Data extraction forms were generated to record information from each meta-analysis and the included individual studies. First author, year of publication, outcome measure, biomarker and cancer diagnosis were extracted from each meta-analysis.

        <p>The weighted inverse variance method was used with restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimations to reproduce all included meta-analyses in 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> with the "meta" package 17 and "metagen" command. 18 For each cancer site specific biomarker and outcome pair, the summary effect size and 95% confidence interval were calculated using fixed and random effects models with adjustment by the Knapp-Hartung modification. To take into account heterogeneity between studies, a random effects model was used to compute summary effect size estimates. 19,20 Estimates from the fixed effects model are also presented.
        </p>
        <p>Each included meta-analysis was reproduced to yield both fixed and random effects estimates. Reproduced random or fixed effect estimates which did not match the results of the original review results were assessed for absolute and percent difference. Metaanalyses with a difference in HR of 0.01 were attributed to rounding errors. Studies with larger discrepancies were investigated to determine the source of disagreement. Where there were issues with reproducibility, the calculated values of the random effects model were used to assess the evidence for the association.Each included meta-analysis was reproduced to yield both fixed and random effects estimates.

        <p>We calculated 95% prediction intervals (PI) in order to assess the impact of uncertainty around the summary effect size estimate and between-study variance (Tau). 21 Prediction intervals account for the uncertainty caused by heterogeneity when estimating the distribution of true effect sizes in an association and yield an interval which predicts the effect size of future studies investigating the same association. 21 In studies with large amounts of heterogeneity or an effect size close to the null value, the prediction interval may be wide enough to include the null value (HR=1). This suggests the true effect size in a single meta-analysis may be a HR of 1 or &lt;1. We further assessed heterogeneity with Cochran's Q test and quantified using the I 2 statistic. 22 We considered Cochran's Q test to detect a departure from homogeny in the effect sizes of individual studies when P&lt;0.10. 22 Due to common limitations associated with Cochran's Q test, the I 2 statistic was also used to quantify the percentage of variation which can be attributed to heterogeneity. 22 The 95% confidence intervals around each I 2 value were included to evaluate the uncertainty around estimates of heterogeneity. 23 However, large measures of variation due to heterogeneity, representing true heterogeneity or inconsistency due to bias, 24 were primarily assessed through prediction intervals. To further assess heterogeneity, we used sub-group analysis and metaregression and as detailed below.We calculated 95% prediction intervals (PI) in order to assess the impact of uncertainty around the summary effect size estimate and between-study variance (Tau). 21 Prediction intervals account for the uncertainty caused by heterogeneity when estimating the distribution of true effect sizes in an association and yield an interval which predicts the effect size of future studies investigating the same association. 21 In studies with large amounts of heterogeneity or an effect size close to the null value, the prediction interval may be wide enough to include the null value (HR=1).

        <p>To further explore heterogeneity and determine the impact of adjustment with additional prognostic factors, sub-group analyses of the statistical models used in each study were conducted. Meta-analyses which reported the analysis method (univariate or multivariate) of their component studies were included. The Q test for subgroup differences was used to test for significant differences in the random effects model effect size between subgroups in each meta-analysis (P&lt;0.05).To further explore heterogeneity and determine the impact of adjustment with additional prognostic factors, sub-group analyses of the statistical models used in each study were conducted.

        <p>Meta-regression was used to assess NLR cut-offs as a source of heterogeneity in all component studies that reported them. 25 We used a random-effects meta-regression model with REML estimates to account for residual heterogeneity and the Knapp-Hartung method to adjust CIs and test statistics. 26 Small study effects and funnel plot asymmetry were quantified through the arcsine-Thompson test described by Rücker et al. 2008 and the command "metabias" from the 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> package "meta". 27,17 The arcsine-Thompson has greater power than similar tests of small study effects when heterogeneity is present, however it may be overly conservative when no heterogeneity is present. 27 A low significance value in the arcsine-Thompson test (P&lt;0.10) was used to indicate presence of small study effects which could reflect publication and other selective reporting biases. Further assessment was carried out to determine if the summary effect size estimate of each meta-analysis was greater than the point estimate of the largest included study, indicating potential small study effects. 28 A meta-analysis was judged to have evidence of small study effects if either one of these criteria were met.
        </p>
        <p>The test for excess significance (TES) was used to determine if the number of observed significant results differed significantly from the expected number, indicating reporting bias. 29 TES results can reveal reporting bias if the number of observed studies with significant results in each meta-analysis is significantly larger than the expected number using a two-tailed binomial probability test (P&lt;0.10). 30 The expected number of significant results in each meta-analysis was calculated as the sum of the statistical power estimate, or the probability that each component study will find a positive result. 29,30 The estimated power for each component study was calculated in 
            <rs type="software">Stata</rs>
            <rs type="version">14</rs>, 31 using the "power cox" command to calculate the power of each test given its sample size, effect size and significance level. 32 The estimation of power for each component study also requires an estimation of the true effect size, so the effect size of the largest study was used to give an estimation of true effect with the smallest standard error. Estimates from both fixed and random effects models were included for sensitivity analysis. The "binom.test" command in R was used to assess the significance of differences in the number of observed versus expected significant studies using an exact binomial test. 33 Credibility ceilings were utilised for sensitivity analysis and to test the robustness of meta-analyses, considering studies of biomarkers often underestimate biases due to large sample sizes and observational study design. 34,35 Credibility ceiling calculations inflate the variance of each study included in a meta-analysis to account for the probability c that the true effect size is in the opposite direction of effect of the observed point estimate. 35 Inflated variances were calculated in 
            <rs type="software">Stata</rs>
            <rs type="version">14.</rs> 31,34 The summary effect size and heterogeneity of each meta-analysis was assessed with ceiling values ranging from 5 to 20%.

The number of studies in each meta-analysis was also included as eligibility criterion for strong evidence since a sample size greater than three is required for reliable assessment of heterogeneity and small study effects. 22,38,39 Associations categorised as "highly suggestive" were eligible to be upgraded to "strong" if they presented a HR&gt;2 and a lower 95% CI&gt;1.6. 40 To assess the potential impact of limitations around the measures assessing heterogeneity on the GRADE criteria, we performed a sensitivity analysis in which I 2 and Cochran's Q test criteria were removed for associations classified as strong.

        <p>In 48 meta-analyses (24%), the largest component study was not statistically significant at P&lt;0.05. However, 42 (88%) of these meta-analyses still had a statistically significant summary random effects estimate. In three meta-analyses, 70,72,96 the largest component study had an effect size in the opposite direction to the random effects estimate (HR&lt;1). The effect size estimates of the largest component studies tended to be more conservative than the random effect estimates, with 136 meta-analyses (67%) yielding a HR which was greater than the point estimate of the largest component study. However, there was correlation between the log(HR) of the summary random effects and the largest component study for each meta-analysis, indicating consistency in the results (Figure 2A).In 48 meta-analyses (24%), the largest component study was not statistically significant at P&lt;0.05. However, 42 (88%) of these meta-analyses still had a statistically significant summary random effects estimate.

        <p>In order to determine the impact of study size on the magnitude of the summary effect size, random effects estimates were plotted against the inverse variance of the pooled effect size from each meta-analysis. When compared to meta-analyses with large variances, those with smaller variances produced more conservative estimates, displaying a smaller range of HR estimates and a slight tendency toward a null value (HR=1). Meta-analyses with large variance displayed a wide range of random effects HR and included an increased number of HR estimates greater than two (Figure 2B).In order to determine the impact of study size on the magnitude of the summary effect size, random effects estimates were plotted against the inverse variance of the pooled effect size from each meta-analysis.

        <p>This umbrella review does not address causality directly and cannot determine whether the association between neutrophils and poor prognosis in cancer is causal or due to confounding or reverse causation. 135,136 Previous studies have highlighted the paradoxical role of neutrophils in both tumour progression and suppression. 13 Our study suggests that the overall effect of high NLR could be tumourigenic in certain cases, but further work is required to assess this.This umbrella review does not address causality directly and cannot determine whether the association between neutrophils and poor prognosis in cancer is causal or due to confounding or reverse causation. 135,136 Previous studies have highlighted the paradoxical role of neutrophils in both tumour progression and suppression. 13 Our study suggests that the overall effect of high NLR could be tumourigenic in certain cases, but further work is required to assess this.</p>
        <p>Our study supports the relationship between elevated NLR and poor outcomes in cancer in terms of effect size and consistency of findings. We cannot address temporality as the studies included measured biomarkers before the initiation of treatment but after diagnosis. The biological mechanisms behind inflammation and cancer progression could suggest temporality, as elevated NLR and TAN are proposed to promote increased cell proliferation, angiogenesis and risk of metastasis as contributors to poor prognosis. 5,13,137Our study supports the relationship between elevated NLR and poor outcomes in cancer in terms of effect size and consistency of findings.

        <p>Future research should focus on strengthening the current evidence base for specific cancers which displayed suggestive and highly suggestive associations, addressing heterogeneity and small-study issues. Unveiling a causal association between neutrophils and cancer outcomes could lead to cancer treatments which involve neutrophils as a therapeutic target and validate the NLR as a prognostic biomarker in cancer. A causal association between neutrophils and poor prognosis could give further insight into experimental therapy which lowers neutrophils counts in the body to improve outcomes in cancer. [138][139][140][141] Sub-group analysis suggested that the magnitude and direction of effect of NLR on cancer outcomes was robust to adjustment for additional prognostic factors. Regardless, consensus on a minimum set of covariates to adjust for is needed. Furthermore, the dose response relationship between NLR and prognosis remains unclear. Within the included papers, only two of the 86 conducted a dose response analysis. 82,142 Future work should consider whether the association is linear or has threshold effects. In light of the variation observed in metaregressions of NLR cut-off and effect size, identification of a clinically relevant NLR cut-off could be specific to different cancer sites and may be affected by treatment. Future systematic reviews should consider performing individual patient data (IPD) metaanalyses to allow for the assessment of NLR values on a continuous scale.Future research should focus on strengthening the current evidence base for specific cancers which displayed suggestive and highly suggestive associations, addressing heterogeneity and small-study issues.

        <p>The quantitative evidence presented suggests an association between elevated NLR and poor outcomes in cancer patients across a wide spectrum of diagnoses, stages of disease and courses of treatment. The evidence is strongest for associations between NLR and OS in prostate, non muscle-invasive bladder and nasopharyngeal cancer, amongst others. Overall however, and in particular for associations between TAN and poor prognosis in cancer patients, evidence is limited by study quality, heterogeneity and small-study effects. Further research is required to overcome the limitations of the existing evidence.The quantitative evidence presented suggests an association between elevated NLR and poor outcomes in cancer patients across a wide spectrum of diagnoses, stages of disease and courses of treatment.
