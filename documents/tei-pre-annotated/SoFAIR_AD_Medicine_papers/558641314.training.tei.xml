        <p>The global supply of COVID-19 vaccines remains limited. An understanding of the immune response that is predictive of protection could facilitate rapid licensure of new vaccines. Data from a randomized efficacy trial of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine in the United Kingdom was analyzed to determine the antibody levels associated with protection against SARS-CoV-2. Binding and neutralizing antibodies at 28 days after the second dose were measured in infected and noninfected vaccine recipients. Higher levels of all immune markers were correlated with a reduced risk of symptomatic infection. A vaccine efficacy of 80% against symptomatic infection with majority Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant of SARS-CoV-2 was achieved with 264 (95% CI: 108, 806) binding antibody units (BAU)/ml: and 506 (95% CI: 135, not computed (beyond data range) (NC)) BAU/ml for anti-spike and anti-RBD antibodies, and 26 (95% CI: NC, NC) international unit (IU)/ml and 247 (95% CI: 101, NC) normalized neutralization titers (NF 50 ) for pseudovirus and live-virus neutralization, respectively. Immune markers were not correlated with asymptomatic infections at the 5% significance level. These data can be used to bridge to new populations using validated assays, and allow extrapolation of efficacy estimates to new COVID-19 vaccines.The global supply of COVID-19 vaccines remains limited.

        <p>The global supply of COVID-19 vaccines remains limited despite intense production efforts. Authorization of new vaccines could help meet demand. As more countries implement vaccine programs, it will become increasingly difficult to conduct clinical efficacy studies of new vaccines. Understanding the relationship between immune responses to vaccines and protection against clinical outcomes is urgently needed to speed vaccine development. Knowledge of immune measures that are statistically associated with protection against disease ('correlates of protection') may allow new vaccines to be authorized for use on the basis of immunogenicity and safety data alone, when large efficacy trials are not feasible. In addition, understanding the immune response allows for comparison of vaccines across cohorts of people who differ by age, race, ethnicity, or other factors.The global supply of COVID-19 vaccines remains limited despite intense production efforts.

        <p>Evidence that antibodies may play a role in mediating protection against overt disease has come from vaccination and challenge studies in animals. Both neutralizing antibody titers and Fc-dependent functional antibody responses correlate with protection induced by DNA and adenoviral vector vaccines in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) 21,22 . Additionally, higher doses of passively transferred monoclonal antibodies were more protective than were lower doses in golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) and rhesus macaques challenged with the SARS-CoV-2 virus containing D614 in its spike protein 23 .Evidence that antibodies may play a role in mediating protection against overt disease has come from vaccination and challenge studies in animals.

        <p>A meta-analysis modeling the relationship between VE reported from phase 3 vaccine clinical trials and neutralization titers in convalescent patients showed a significant association at the study level between VE and neutralizing antibody levels 24 . Nevertheless, no study to date has defined a correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection or disease that can be used by regulators and vaccine developers. The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222) is a chimpanzee adenoviral vector vaccine with full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike insert which was developed at the University of Oxford and is in widespread global use and produced by AstraZeneca and their manufacturing partners. Using data from the United Kingdom and Brazil, we previously estimated an overall VE of 66.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 57.4 to 74.0) against symptomatic infection and 27.3% (95% CI: -17.2 to 54.9) against asymptomatic infection 2,3 . We previously showed that estimates of VE against symptomatic COVID-19 infection were higher in subgroups with higher pseudovirus neutralization antibody titers, or higher anti-spike IgG levels, in vaccine clinical trials of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in adults using summarized data 3 . Here, we report the relationship between a continuous measure of the humoral immune responses to vaccination and protection afforded by this vaccine, which may facilitate further vaccine development. Specifically, we used individual data from the United Kingdom and identified the thresholds for four immune markers associated with protection against symptomatic infection. The WHO international standard units are reported for all assays, to allow comparisons across studies and platforms.A meta-analysis modeling the relationship between VE reported from phase 3 vaccine clinical trials and neutralization titers in convalescent patients showed a significant association at the study level between VE and neutralizing antibody levels 24 .

        <p>Using the COV002 data from the United Kingdom, we assessed the correlation between immune markers at 28 days post the second dose (post-boost + 28 days, PB28) of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. Participants were reminded weekly to contact their study site if they experienced any of the primary symptoms of COVID-19 (fever ≥ 37.8 °C; cough; shortness of breath; anosmia or ageusia) and were assessed in clinic with a nose and throat swab taken for nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). Additionally, participants were asked to complete a nose and throat swab at home each week, which was used to detect asymptomatic infections. Nucleic acid amplification test positive (NAAT+) participants who had symptoms other than the main five COVID-19 symptoms were categorized as nonprimary symptomatic and were not included in correlates analysis.Using the COV002 data from the United Kingdom, we assessed the correlation between immune markers at 28 days post the second dose (post-boost + 28 days, PB28) of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and symptomatic and asymptomatic infections.

        <p>Here, we report an analysis of potential correlates of protection using data from 171 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 1,404 noncases, showing that higher anti-spike IgG, anti-RBD IgG, and neutralizing antibody titers are all associated with lower risk of symptomatic disease. We used immune responses in a phase 2/3 clinical trial to derive a model to predict absolute risk of infection, with appropriate adjustment for bias, assigning estimates for each level of antibody in the dataset. The relative risk of infection was then derived by reference to risk of infection in the control group. This is a robust approach to derive population estimates and was adapted from recently described methods 25,26 .Here, we report an analysis of potential correlates of protection using data from 171 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 1,404 noncases, showing that higher anti-spike IgG, anti-RBD IgG, and neutralizing antibody titers are all associated with lower risk of symptomatic disease.

        <p>We previously published overall aggregate-level summaries of antibody levels in participants with different prime-boost intervals. Vaccination prime-boost intervals were associated with varying levels of VE, and there are some intriguing similarities between the aggregate-level data with the estimate provided from analysis of individual participant level data in this report. The estimated anti-spike IgG level of 40,923 AU/ml and the pseudovirus neutralizing antibody titer of 185 associated with 80% VE in our models were similar to the geometric mean titers of 48,961 AU/ml and 237.0, respectively, previously reported in the subgroup of participants vaccinated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 with a dose interval of at least 12 weeks between their first and second dose-a regimen that provided 80.0% (95% CI 65.2 to 88.5) VE in the pooled analysis of clinical trial data from the United Kingdom, Brazil, and South Africa 3 . The aggregate-level results previously published included all eligible participants in the assessment of VE, but only those with available antibody data were included in the summaries of immunogenicity, meaning that direct comparisons of efficacy with immunogenicity were not in the same populations. Our current approach analyzes the relationship between infections and antibody levels at the individual level in a single set of participants, with appropriate adjustment for confounding, providing robust outputs. In addition, the current work provides outputs in WHO standard units, which are necessary for comparisons with data from other laboratories with different assays.We previously published overall aggregate-level summaries of antibody levels in participants with different prime-boost intervals.

        <p>No serological measurements in our data were shown to correlate with protection against asymptomatic infection or against symptomatic illness with only mild upper respiratory symptoms.

        <p>The antibody correlates presented in this report relate to protection against mild disease, defined as a NAAT+ test with at least one symptom present. Weekly self-swabbing in the trial enabled detection of many mild cases. At these antibody titers, efficacy against more severe endpoints, used in other trials, would be higher than the estimates in this analysis. Notably, this has been confirmed in the analysis of real-world effectiveness, in which the milder cases are not detected, after two doses of the vaccines in older adults in England, where VE was 90% for Pfizer and 89% for ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 against symptomatic disease using the same case definition for both vaccines 11 , while lower efficacy estimates were measured in our previously reported efficacy analysis with a milder disease endpoint 2 .The antibody correlates presented in this report relate to protection against mild disease, defined as a NAAT+ test with at least one symptom present.

        <p>The correlates of vaccine efficacy reported here could be used to extrapolate efficacy to immunogenicity data for novel vaccines where clinical efficacy results are unavailable. A trial of a new vaccine that works through similar immune mechanisms and which produces antibody responses that are above the correlate values reported here in at least 50% of participants (that is, it has a similar or higher median), might be expected to have similar efficacy against the clinical endpoints used in our UK trial, and higher efficacy against more severe endpoints. We provide correlates for vaccine efficacy estimates ranging from 50% to 90% to allow flexibility in the way these estimates are utilized by the regulators and policy-makers.The correlates of vaccine efficacy reported here could be used to extrapolate efficacy to immunogenicity data for novel vaccines where clinical efficacy results are unavailable.

        <p>These observations indicate that the reduced neutralizing capacity against B.1.351 and other variants of concern, might drive reduced protection against initial infection, and perhaps transmission, but protection against severe disease is maintained. Clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have consistently shown higher efficacy against more severe forms of disease, such as those causing hospitalization or death, than against mild infections [2][3][4][5]15,31 . We are unable to assess correlates of protection against severe disease or hospitalization as there were no vaccinated participants hospitalized in the COV002 study. Although live-virus and pseudovirus neutralization assays were modestly correlated with each other, the live-virus assay was more closely associated with protection against symptomatic COVID-19 than was the pseudovirus assay. This may reflect the sensitivity and dynamic range of the assays.These observations indicate that the reduced neutralizing capacity against B.1.351 and other variants of concern, might drive reduced protection against initial infection, and perhaps transmission, but protection against severe disease is maintained.

        <p>Protection against symptomatic COVID-19 is not absolute with any vaccine, and the results presented here show that there is no single threshold value for any of the assays investigated that was indicative of sterilizing immunity in our data. Instead, the probability of infection decreases on average with higher immune responses, but substantial variation exists between individuals. This is similar to studies of respiratory syncytial virus, in which risk of infection decreased with higher antibody levels, although infections were still observed at high antibody levels, suggesting that a definitive individual threshold of protection does not exist 32 . We provide antibody estimates that correspond with 50% to 90% VE; however, the wide CIs around these estimates should be noted.Protection against symptomatic COVID-19 is not absolute with any vaccine, and the results presented here show that there is no single threshold value for any of the assays investigated that was indicative of sterilizing immunity in our data.

        <p>These estimates represent the antibody level observed 28 days after a second dose of vaccine that provide protection during the subsequent 4-to 6-month period among UK COV002 efficacy and immunogenicity cohorts.

Further work is needed to determine the durability of antibody and long-term protection after vaccination.These estimates represent the antibody level observed 28 days after a second dose of vaccine that provide protection during the subsequent 4-to 6-month period among UK COV002 efficacy and immunogenicity cohorts.

        <p>High levels of protection were noted after vaccination with one dose of a lipid nanoparticle RNA vaccine, despite modest levels of neutralizing antibody, strongly supporting the concept that other mechanisms are at play as co-correlates of protection 5,33 . We have previously shown that a wide range of Fc-mediated antibody functions are induced by vaccination, and it is possible that these functions may be important in the absence of neutralizing antibody 34 . Furthermore, strong T cell responses induced by ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 may contribute to protection 14,16 and have been associated with recovery from COVID-19 disease [35][36][37] . The relationship between antibody and T cell responses may differ depending on the type of vaccine used, and care should be taken when interpreting data from clinical testing of different vaccine technologies.High levels of protection were noted after vaccination with one dose of a lipid nanoparticle RNA vaccine, despite modest levels of neutralizing antibody, strongly supporting the concept that other mechanisms are at play as co-correlates of protection 5,33 .

A formal validation has since been completed (after the testing of clinical study samples in this manuscript).

        <p>Approximately 10% of the pseudovirus neutralization antibody titers were below the LLOQ. We performed a sensitivity analysis to account for the potential bias caused by imputing LLOQ / 2. Studies have shown that imputing LLOQ / 2 can lead to bias and CIs with poor coverage when a substantial proportion of the data are censored [41][42][43] . When a bootstrap is required for missing data, Brand et al. found single imputation embedded inside a bootstrap showed better statistical properties than other methods 43 .

        <p>Not all participants with results from the pseudovirus neutralization titer also have results from the anti-spike, anti-RBD, and live neutralizing antibody titers. For each bootstrap sample, we iteratively predicted the missing and censored values for each antibody titers in a Gibbs sampler, constraining the predictions for the censored values to be less than or equal to the LLOQ. The antibody titers were iteratively predicted by a sequence of Bayesian linear regressions. For each regression, the independent variables were the current prediction for all other titers, the baseline risk score and all variables used in the inverse probability weighting model.Not all participants with results from the pseudovirus neutralization titer also have results from the anti-spike, anti-RBD, and live neutralizing antibody titers.
