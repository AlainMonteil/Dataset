        <p>Background. The severe inflammatory state secondary to Covid-19 leads to a severe derangement of hemostasis that has been recently described as a state of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and consumption coagulopathy, defined as decreased platelet count, increased fibrin(ogen) degradation products such as D-dimer as well as low fibrinogen.Background.

        <p>Aims. Whole blood from 24 patients admitted at the intensive care unit because of Covid-19 was collected and evaluated with thromboelastography by the TEG point-of-care device on a single occasion and six underwent repeated measurements on two consecutive days for a total of 30 observations.

        <p>Results. TEG parameters are consistent with a state of hypercoagulability as shown by decreased R and K values, and increased values of K angle and MA. Platelet count was normal or increased, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were near(normal). Fibrinogen was increased and D-dimer was dramatically increased. Creactive protein was increased. Factor VIII and von Willebrand factor (n=11) were increased. Antithrombin (n=11) was marginally decreased and protein C (n=11) was increased.Results.

        <p>The results of this cohort of patients with Covid-19 are not consistent with acute DIC, rather they support hypercoagulability together with a severe inflammatory state. These findings may explain the events of venous thromboembolism observed in some of these patients and support antithrombotic prophylaxis/treatment. Clinical trials are urgently needed to establish the type of drug, dosage and optimal duration of prophylaxis.The results of this cohort of patients with Covid-19 are not consistent with acute DIC, rather they support hypercoagulability together with a severe inflammatory state.

        <p>The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the pandemic outbreak across the Word [1,2]. The clinical condition that is associated with the infection has been named Covid-19. The major clinical challenge associated with Covid-19 is severe, often fatal, interstitial pneumonia [3]. The severe inflammatory state secondary to the infection leads to a severe derangement of hemostasis typically observed in patients with sepsis and has been described as a state of acute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), based on decreased platelet count, prolonged prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin time (PT/APTT), increased fibrin(ogen) degradation products such as D dimer as well as low fibrinogen [4]. Clinical observations made on a series of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of our hospital, showed however that a certain number of patients with Covid-19 developed clinical signs of pulmonary embolism and/or deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs (unpublished observations). The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in these patients has not been confirmed with imaging or autopsy in all patients, as in most cases the former was not promptly available and the latter is currently not allowed in all hospitals by health authorities. However, pulmonary embolism diagnoses are supported by the fact that most (up to 1/3) Covid-19 patients had deep vein thromboses of the lower limbs as shown by compression ultrasonography. Since a thromboelastography point of care device was available in the ICU, we decided to collect viscoelastic observations in some of the Covid-19 patients.The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the pandemic outbreak across the Word [1,2].

Tests were carried out by TEG (Haemonetics TEG 5000, Braintree, MA), an vitro point of care device, able of assessing the viscoelastic properties of clotting native whole blood upon activation of hemostasis by exogenously added triggers (kaolin). The assay system mimics to some extent what occurs in vivo with the contribution of blood cells, platelets and plasma. TEG evaluation was performed in the presence of heparinase, meant to quench heparin as most of the patients were on prophylaxis with low molecular weight (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin. We recorded the following parameters. R (minutes), which is a measure of the clotting time from the point of coagulation ignition to the appearance of the clot; K (minutes) and K angle, which define the velocity of clot formation; MA (mm), which defines the maximal amplitude of the clot; Lys-30, which defines the percentage decrease of clot amplitude at 30 minutes post-MA. Accordingly, short R, K or Lys-30 as well as high K angle or MA denote hypercoagulability.Thromboelastography.

Twenty-four patients were evaluated by the TEG on a single occasion and six underwent repeated measurements on two consecutive days thereafter for a total of 30 observations. Table 1 shows the viscoelastic as well as hemostasis and other biochemical results. Their values have been compared with the mean of the respective reference range, previously established in our laboratory using 40 heathy adult subjects. R and K values were shorter than the mean value of the reference population in 50% and 83% of the Covid19 population, respectively. K angle and MA values were higher than the mean value of the reference population in 72% and 83% of the Covid-19 population, respectively.

        <p>This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved Overall, the results of this study support the concept that the hypercoagulability displayed by TEG is due to the profound derangement of hemostasis and is the likely contributor to pulmonary embolism and/or deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs observed in patients with Covid-19. Other contributions may stem from the endothelial dysfunction (as shown by the greatly increased levels of von Willebrand factor, both antigen and ristocetin cofactor) and sepsis subsequent to the massive infection. There are few studies dealing with hemostasis derangement and Covid-19. Tang et al [5] reported results compatible with a state of DIC, which were however based on such biochemical markers as high fibrin degradation products (e.g., D dimer), prolonged PT/APTT and low platelet counts. Part of the above results are confirmed in this report (e.g., increased D dimer), but other signs of DIC such as prolonged PT/APTT are not confirmed. Furthermore, reduced platelet counts and low fibrinogen clotting activity, which are pathognomonic signs of DIC are normal or even increased in our cohort and do not support the consumption coagulopathy, which is the hallmark of acute DIC. The reasons for the discrepancy is unclear. It cannot be excluded that the two populations, although both admitted to the ICU, were at different time points during the course of the disease progression.This article is protected by copyright.

        <p>Cumulatively, our results suggest that patients with Covid-19 may develop a state of hypercoagulability as shown by the TEG parameters, increased factor VIII, von Willebrand factor and fibrinogen. This hypercoagulability could contribute (in addition to other causes) to the development of pulmonary embolism and/or deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs. The reasons for the observed hypercoagulability are unknown. Plasma hypercoagulability may be commonly due to increased levels of pro-coagulant factors, decreased levels of the naturally occurring anti-coagulant factors or both. In this cohort factor VIII, which is one of the most potent triggers of hypercoagulability, was strongly increased (up to 460 U/dL, Table1) and the main naturally occurring anticoagulants are (near)normal (i.e., antithrombin) or even increased (i.e., protein C). Additional explanations for the hypercoagulability may be the presence of high numbers of circulating microvesicles. These moieties are cytoplasmic microparticles stemming from platelets or monocytes, which carry the procoagulant asset of the parent cells (i.e., tissue factor from monocytes and phosphatydil-serine from platelets). Microvesicles are known determinants of venous thromboembolism [6].

Neutrophil external traps (NET), which are released from activated neutrophils, constitute a mixture of nucleic DNA, histones and nucleosomes [8], which may add procoagulant substances associated with plasma hypercoagulability and increased risk of thrombosis in animal models and in humans [9,10]. It is well known that inflammation is closely associated with thrombosis. Proinflammatory cytokines are established modulators of coagulation and fibrinolysis activation [11] and might constitute another formidable trigger to explain the procoagulant imbalance in patients with Covid-19. Finally, endothelial derangement may play an additional role. Elevated von Willebrand factor levels found in this study (up to 863 U/dL, Table 1) may be taken as surrogate markers of endothelial derangement in Covid-19.This article is protected by copyright.

        <p>Whatever the reasons, the signs of hypercoagulability observed in this study would support the use of antithrombotic drugs in patients with Covid-19 to quench the procoagulant imbalance and possibly venous thromboembolism (either deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs or pulmonary embolism). Some limitations of this study should be recognized. First, blood collection and laboratory tests were not performed for all consecutive patients seen at the ICU in a pre-specified period (i.e., 13-24 th March 2020). It is therefore possible that there may be a selection bias and that the sample size is not large enough to represent the whole population of Covid-19 patients admitted to ICU. Second, the direct signs of hypercoagulability observed in this cohort rest mainly on the TEG parameters. This device is used to guide transfusion in critically ill hemorrhagic patients [12] and more rarely to detect hypercoagulability, although there are observations showing that TEG is also useful to detect hypercoagulability [13][14][15]. These limitations notwithstanding, it is of interest to note that a state of hypercoagulability has been shown in these patients. Although, a recent study showed that the antithrombotic prophylaxis with LMWH or unfractionated heparin is associated with decreased mortality in severe Covid-19 patients [16], the benefit/risk ratio of using other anticoagulants, as well as the timing of starting anticoagulation at which dose and how long for, should be evaluated by appropriate randomized clinical trials.Whatever the reasons, the signs of hypercoagulability observed in this study would support the use of antithrombotic drugs in patients with Covid-19 to quench the procoagulant imbalance and possibly venous thromboembolism (either deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs or pulmonary embolism).
