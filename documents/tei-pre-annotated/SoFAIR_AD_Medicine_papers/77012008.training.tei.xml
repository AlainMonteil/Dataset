        <p>Antimicrobial resistance is an internationally recognised threat to health. The contribution of primary healthcare is particularly important as this is where almost 80% of all antibiotics used within the health service are prescribed. 1 Bacterial infections resistant to antibiotics can limit the availability of effective treatment options, rendering some commonly encountered bacterial infections difficult to treat, including those of the urinary tract. Antibiotic resistant infections are also twice as likely to be associated with greater morbidity and mortality and are associated with increased healthcare costs. 2 In low income countries, affordability of second line drugs and reduced access to healthcare can restrict the use of newer broad spectrum antibiotics, resulting in growing concerns for increased morbidity and mortality from antibiotic resistant infections in these countries. 3 Children receive a lot of primary healthcare services and, as such, receive a disproportionately high number of antibiotics compared with middle aged populations. 4 Children are also key drivers of infection within communities and can contribute to the spread of bacteria from person to person.

        <p>Urinary tract infections are one of the most common bacterial infections seen in primary care. 6 In children with a suspected urinary tract infection, the most common management strategy is to treat empirically with an antibiotic while results of culture and sensitivity testing are awaited. Young children are more vulnerable to immediate and long term complications, including renal scarring and renal failure, 7 and therefore require prompt appropriate treatment. Escherichia coli is responsible for over 80% of all urinary tract infections 8 and is also the most common cause of bacteraemia and foodborne infections and a cause of meningitis in neonates. 9 We conducted a systematic review to investigate the prevalence of resistance in community acquired E coli urinary tract infection to the most commonly prescribed antibiotics given to children in primary care and to quantify the relation between previous exposure to antibiotics in primary care and bacterial resistance. We stratified results by OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) status of the study countries as antibiotics tend to be used differently in these groups. In the more developed OECD countries antibiotics are obtained mostly only by prescription, whereas in "developing" non-OECD countries many antibiotics, including those commonly used to treat urinary tract infection, can be obtained over the counter, without the need for a prescription.

        <p>We extracted and reported resistance to antibiotics commonly prescribed and reported for urinary tract infection in children in primary care: ampicillin, co-amoxiclav (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid), co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), trimethoprim, nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftazidime (as a marker for cephalosporin resistance). Ampicillin was reported in place of amoxicillin because of more frequent reporting and its equivalence in spectrum of antimicrobial activity. 16 We used the Cochrane collaboration's risk of bias tool to assess papers for quality. 17 Selection bias was assessed with the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist for cohort and case-control studies (www. casp-uk.net). We produced quality assessment charts based on a traffic light system of "good," "adequate," and "poor" reporting (see appendix 2), as recommended by Cochrane. 17 Our key quality criteria for eligible studies were a reliable measure of antibiotic resistance; clear reporting of bacterial resistance in children and young people aged up to 17; and clear reporting of urinary bacteria isolated as community acquired. The same key quality indicators applied for papers that included information on previous antibiotic exposure, with the addition of adjustment for confounders including age, sex, previous admission to hospital, and comorbidities.We extracted and reported resistance to antibiotics commonly prescribed and reported for urinary tract infection in children in primary care: ampicillin, co-amoxiclav (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid), co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), trimethoprim, nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftazidime (as a marker for cephalosporin resistance).

        <p>All statistical analyses were conducted with 
            <rs type="software">Stata</rs> version 
            <rs type="version">13</rs> software, and all methods undertaken according to PRISMA guidelines. 18 We calculated estimates of pooled prevalence of resistance by generating a forest plot for each antibiotic, stratified by OECD status. Forest plots illustrated the proportion of resistant E coli for each country, along with 95% confidence intervals, and the pooled prevalence of resistance per antibiotic per economic country group (OECD v non-OECD). We calculated pooled estimates for each country and for OECD and non-OECD groups using the pooled country estimates. Pooled prevalence estimates were generated for children/ young people of all age groups (ages 0-17) and children aged 0-5, for comparison. When we could identify the first line antibiotics, these were indicated in the forest plot. I 2 of 25%, 50%, and 75% were used to signify low level, moderate level, and high level heterogeneity, in line with Cochrane recommendations. 17 All pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals were generated with double arcsine transformation to adjust for variance instability. This avoids implausible 95% confidence intervals for prevalence estimates when generated under the normal approximation. 19 For studies investigating the association between previous antibiotic exposure and bacterial resistance, the outcome measure was the odds ratio of bacterial resistance in children previously exposed to antibiotics compared with those children previously unexposed. The crude estimates from these studies were grouped according to the reported preceding exposure time period (0-1 month, 0-3 months, and 0-6 months). One study investigated exposure at discrete time intervals up to 12 months or more before urine sampling and was reported separately. We carried out a random effects meta-analysis and generated a pooled odds ratio for each exposure time period measured. These were compared with adjusted odds ratios for each time period, when reported. We assessed heterogeneity using the I 2 statistic. Meta-regression was used to investigate differences in the odds ratios between antibiotic exposure and resistance across different time periods. Finally, we generated funnel plots to explore the possibility of small study effects, which can be caused by publication bias.

        <p>association between previous antibiotic exposure and bacterial resistance Figure 3 shows a forest plot of five studies investigating the relation between previous exposure to any versus no antibiotics and bacterial resistance. The studies varied in the combinations of antibiotic resistance and exposure investigated, some reporting resistance and exposure to any antibiotic, while others reported resistance to trimethoprim, co-trimoxazole, or third generation cephalosporins. In figure 3 , for all time periods of exposure the crude odds of resistance were greater in children exposed to antibiotics than in those who were unexposed. The effect sizes show a decline between exposure time periods of 0-1 month (pooled odds ratio 8.38, 95% confidence interval 2.84 to 24.77) and 0-3 months (3.38, 2.05 to 5.55), then an increase at 0-6 months (13.23, 7.84 to 22.31). The study by Allen and colleagues, which explored the association between exposure to any antibiotic in the previous six months and resistance to co-trimoxazole, measured previous exposure to antibiotics for four weeks or more within the six months before the urine sample was taken. The three other studies shown in figure 3 measured exposure to any antibiotic for an unspecified total prescription time period. Given the overlap in the exposure time periods reported by the included studies, we did not conduct a meta-regression analysis for the data presented in figure 3.association between previous antibiotic exposure and bacterial resistance Figure 3 shows a forest plot of five studies investigating the relation between previous exposure to any versus no antibiotics and bacterial resistance.

        <p>In most countries it is standard practice to treat empirically with an antibiotic when a child presents to primary care with a suspected urinary tract infection. Sometimes a urine sample is taken only if the illness does not respond to first line antibiotic treatment. This can lead to falsely high reported resistance rates to first line antibiotics. This problem would be removed if only incident cases were included or systematic urine sampling was used, but studies did not present this information. That said, there were no obvious differences in resistance rates according to the timing of the urine sampling. Furthermore, variation in sampling strategies could explain some of the variation in pooled prevalence of resistance between OECD and non-OECD countries, though this could not be explored from the data available. Reverse causality and other confounding associations could also have introduced bias to our findings; including previous hospital admissions, comorbidities, age, and sex. Studies that attempted to adjust for confounding factors, however, did not show differences between crude and adjusted estimates of association.In most countries it is standard practice to treat empirically with an antibiotic when a child presents to primary care with a suspected urinary tract infection.

        <p>results in the context of existing research Prevalence of urinary bacterial resistance We believe our rates of prevalence of resistance are accurate as they are consistent with other data sources. The highest reported resistance to ampicillin in our review was similar to the reported aminopenicillin group resistance in the European EARS-Net database and US Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy (CDDEP) databases. 86 87 Resistance to ampicillin in other studies from the US ranged between 36% and 54%, suggesting that resistance to antibiotics in young children is similar to that of the general population. The similarities observed here could be a result of transmission between age groups of genetic resistance factors such as plasmids, facilitated through frequent interaction between children and adults. Trimethoprim resistance was reported by three studies from the UK, all with large sample sizes (&gt;1700 isolates); all reported resistance in excess of 20%. These are similar to levels of trimethoprim resistance reported by other UK based studies; Bean and colleagues reported trimethoprim resistance in community acquired urinary isolates from adults and children at 39%. 88 Additionally, Farrell and colleagues reported 27% resistance in E coli urinary isolates from all age groups. 89 In total, seven OECD studies from five countries (UK, Ireland, Austria, Australia, and Sweden) reported susceptibility to trimethoprim; these were also the only countries to report trimethoprim as a first line antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infection (appendix 5). Trimethoprim resistance was infrequently tested for in many studies from OECD countries, which probably because it is not a first line treatment in their country. Co-trimoxazole was the most common first line treatment for urinary tract infection worldwide (15 countries and 37 studies). Resistance to co-trimoxazole was relatively high worldwide, particularly in non-OECD countries at 64%. Resistance to nitrofurantoin, an antibiotic used almost exclusively for urinary tract infections, was low worldwide, supporting its continued effectiveness as a first line treatment for uncomplicated infections. [90][91][92] For many of the antibiotics reported in this review, the pooled prevalence of resistance was higher in children aged 0-5 than in all children and young people (0-17). It has been previously suggested that resistance levels are likely to be higher in those communities with a higher proportion of young children because of their high consumption of antibiotics. 93 A study conducted in France found that children aged under 7 consumed three times more antibiotics than older populations. 94 The findings in our review support this theory as resistance to all commonly prescribed antibiotics worldwide was higher in younger children than in children of predominantly older age. Our findings also suggest there could be a reversible element of antibiotic resistance, whereby reduced use of antibiotics (in older children) reduces the selective pressure that favours antibiotic resistant strains.results in the context of existing research Prevalence of urinary bacterial resistance We believe our rates of prevalence of resistance are accurate as they are consistent with other data sources.

        <p>Our meta-analysis showing an association between exposure to antibiotics in the previous six months and isolation of resistant urinary isolates is similar to our previous 2010 review, which explored the effect of antibiotic prescribing in primary care on the development of resistance in individual patients of all ages. 5 Consistent with our previous review, we found some evidence from Duffy and colleagues of decreasing resistance for increasing time from antibiotic prescribing. 24 Policy, clinical, and research implications Our findings detail global high level resistance to some of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for children primary care, which could result in several drugs becoming ineffective first line treatments in many countries. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in collaboration with the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) 95 recommend that an antibiotic should be selected for first line empirical treatment of urinary tract infection only if the local prevalence of resistance is less than 20%. According to these guidelines, our review suggests ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, and trimethoprim are no longer suitable first line treatment options for urinary tract infection in many OECD countries and that as a result many guidelines, such as those published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), might need updating. In non-OECD countries, resistance to all first line antibiotics specified for urinary tract infections was in excess of 20% (appendix 5), suggesting that choices of first line treatment might need to be re-evaluated in less well developed countries. Our results also support the need for prescribing guidelines to reflect patterns of local resistance and that, for many areas, nitrofurantoin might be the most appropriate first line treatment for lower urinary tract infection. That said, care is needed because ruling out the use of some first line antibiotics could lead clinicians to prescribe broad spectrum second line antibiotics, such as co-amoxiclav, cephalosporins, and quinolones, resulting in a vicious cycle of increasing use of broad spectrum antibiotics and bacterial resistance.Our meta-analysis showing an association between exposure to antibiotics in the previous six months and isolation of resistant urinary isolates is similar to our previous 2010 review, which explored the effect of antibiotic prescribing in primary care on the development of resistance in individual patients of all ages. 5 Consistent with our previous review, we found some evidence from Duffy and colleagues of decreasing resistance for increasing time from antibiotic prescribing. 24 Policy, clinical, and research implications Our findings detail global high level resistance to some of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for children primary care, which could result in several drugs becoming ineffective first line treatments in many countries.

        <p>Prevalence of resistance to common antibiotics in primary care was higher in non-OECD countries than OECD countries, which could be because of weaker infrastructure of primary care, weaker regulation of antibiotic use, and the need for higher use of antibiotic because of higher risks of serious bacterial infection in children living in non-OECD countries. Improved infrastructure of primary care, access to healthcare, and antibiotic regulation might be necessary to reduce the burden of antimicrobial resistance in these settings.Prevalence of resistance to common antibiotics in primary care was higher in non-OECD countries than OECD countries, which could be because of weaker infrastructure of primary care, weaker regulation of antibiotic use, and the need for higher use of antibiotic because of higher risks of serious bacterial infection in children living in non-OECD countries.

        <p>Furthermore, the results indicate that bacterial resistance to antibiotics can persist for up to six months after antibiotic exposure in individual children. The study conducted by Duffy and colleagues is an exemplar of how future studies should measure associations between resistance and time since exposure to antibiotics. 24 In addition, future studies should also consider inclusion of incident data whenever possible to facilitate better comparison with other studies. Primary care clinicians should consider the impact of any antibiotic use on subsequent antimicrobial resistance and avoid their unnecessary use by following local and national guidance whenever possible. When antibiotic treatment is needed, our findings suggest that clinicians should consider a child's antibiotic use in the past six months when selecting further treatment, avoiding the use of broad spectrum antibiotics whenever possible. 96 Our findings also support other evidence for the continued availability of nitrofurantoin as an effective treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in primary care. 91 97Furthermore, the results indicate that bacterial resistance to antibiotics can persist for up to six months after antibiotic exposure in individual children.
