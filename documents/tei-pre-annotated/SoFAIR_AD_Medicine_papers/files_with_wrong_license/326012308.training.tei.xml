        <p>A cute hypoxemic respiratory failure is among the leading causes of intensive care unit admission in adult patients, often leading to endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation. 1 The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has further highlighted the importance of understanding the best approach to providing respiratory support for patients with respiratory failure. Invasive mechanical ventilation is associated with severe adverse events, 2 and avoiding unnecessary endotracheal intubation remains a major goal in the management of patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. 3 Multiple noninvasive oxygenation strategies have been developed to support oxygenation and ventilation that may lead to a reduced risk of endotracheal intubation and mortality. However, it remains unclear which of these is most effective. 4 Standard oxygen therapy, typically at flow rates of less than 15 L/min, has been the conventional approach to delivering supplemental oxygen to patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Alternatively, noninvasive ventilation using either a face mask or helmet interface has been promoted to reduce the risk of endotracheal intubation. Oxygen delivery at high flow via nasal cannula has been gaining acceptance because of the ability to more closely match a patient's inspiratory demand in the setting of hypoxemia. 5 Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing the effectiveness of noninvasive ventilation or high-flow nasal oxygen with standard oxygen therapy have produced conflicting results. [6][7][8][9][10][11][12] Patients in the control groups in most of these trials received standard oxygen therapy, and there have been few head-to-head comparisons of the other different noninvasive oxygenation modalities. 7,11 Moreover, most metaanalyses have been limited to traditional pairwise comparisons and therefore have not combined direct and indirect evidence for all potential comparisons. [13][14][15][16] To provide additional clinical information, a network metaanalysis was conducted to compare the association of different noninvasive oxygenation strategies with mortality and receipt of endotracheal intubation in adult patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.A cute hypoxemic respiratory failure is among the leading causes of intensive care unit admission in adult patients, often leading to endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation. 1 The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has further highlighted the importance of understanding the best approach to providing respiratory support for patients with respiratory failure.

        <p>A systematic literature search was conducted through April 2020 to identify RCTs enrolling adult patients (&gt;18 years of age) with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure comparing high-flow nasal oxygen, face mask noninvasive ventilation, helmet noninvasive ventilation, or standard oxygen therapy and evaluating 1 or both of the 2 key outcomes of mortality or endotracheal intubation. Studies that were primarily focused on the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ie, &gt;50% of the study population) or congestive heart failure (ie, &gt;50% of the study population) and those evaluating noninvasive oxygen strategies in the immediate postextubation period and after major cardiovascular surgery were excluded. The rationale for excluding studies primarily enrolling these patients was based on the established efficacy of noninvasive ventilation for these conditions. 20,21 However, we anticipated that some included randomized studies would also include patients with congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, given that the etiology of acute respiratory failure is often unclear at presentation or may have an acute on chronic component.A systematic literature search was conducted through April 2020 to identify RCTs enrolling adult patients (&gt;18 years of age) with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure comparing high-flow nasal oxygen, face mask noninvasive ventilation, helmet noninvasive ventilation, or standard oxygen therapy and evaluating 1 or both of the 2 key outcomes of mortality or endotracheal intubation.

        <p>Two reviewers (B.L.F. and F.A.) independently extracted individual study data and evaluated studies for risk of bias using a previously piloted standardized form and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for RCTs. 23 The following domains of each of the primary studies were assessed: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of study participants, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other biases. Based on these domains, the overall risk of bias for each included study was assessed. The certainty of each direct, indirect, and network meta-analysis estimate was estimated based on the 4-step approach suggested by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group (ie, high, moderate, low, and very low certainty). 24 In the presence of incoherence (ie, differences between direct and indirect evidence), the lower certainty of the 2 assessments was assigned to the corresponding network estimate. 24Two reviewers (B.L.F. and F.A.) independently extracted individual study data and evaluated studies for risk of bias using a previously piloted standardized form and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for RCTs. 23 The following domains of each of the primary studies were assessed: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of study participants, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other biases.

        <p>A series of pairwise conventional meta-analyses were performed with random-effects models to assess for direct associations between interventions and study outcomes. Network meta-analyses using bayesian random-effects models (log-link, binomial likelihood) were conducted to derive headto-head treatment estimates comparing all interventions. Analyses were based on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods using minimally informative treatment effect estimates and informative prior distributions for heterogeneity estimates, following the approach suggested by Turner et al. 25 Although these prior distributions were derived in the log odds scale, it was expected that these would be wide enough to cover possible values in the log relative risk scale. Correction of the treatment associations for multigroup trials was applied. 26 Further details on the model specification are in eAppendix 2 in the Supplement. Pairwise and network risk ratios (RRs) were derived, estimating summary estimates from the medians and corresponding 95% credible intervals (CrIs) from the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of the posterior distribution. In addition to relative associations, bayesian analyses were used to produce risk differences and 95% CrIs between treatment groups. Prior distributions for event rates of intubation and allcause mortality in the standard oxygen therapy group were derived from the data and from previous literature. 27 The probability for each treatment to obtain each possible rank (probability of being best, second best, etc) was also estimated. 28 Specifically, in the bayesian framework and in each Markov chain Monte Carlo cycle, each treatment was ranked according to the estimated effect size. The proportion of cycles in which a treatment ranks first out of the total turns into the probability of being first, second, and so forth. 29 Heterogeneity in treatment effects between studies was quantified using the posterior distribution τ 2 . Incoherence between direct and indirect comparisons was estimated using the node-splitting approach contrasting estimates from both direct and indirect evidence. 30,31 Model convergence was assessed using the Brooks-Gelman-Rubin diagnostic, trace plots, and autocorrelation plots. Goodness of fit was assessed by comparing the mean residual deviance with the number of contributing data points. Statistical significance was defined as 95% CrIs that did not include the value 1.0. All analyses were performed in

        <p>Several sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the pooled RRs for the main outcomes. These analyses excluded studies that enrolled any patient with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or congestive heart failure, studies that enrolled postoperative patients, and studies that included patients with less severe respiratory failure (mean partial pressure of arterial oxygen [PaO 2 ] to fraction of inspired oxygen [FIO 2 ] ratio &gt;200). Because there was variability in the timing of reporting of mortality, the analysis of the primary outcome was limited to studies that reported mortality at hospital discharge. An analysis restricted to studies that included at least 50% of immunocompromised patients (ie, &gt;50% of patients with hematologic malignancies, solid tumors with active chemotherapy, treatment with immunosuppressant drugs, or solid organ transplants) was also conducted. Furthermore, to assess the effect of study quality, an analysis restricted to studies with the lowest risk of bias was performed. In addition, to assess the robustness of the findings, the main analyses were refitted using noninformative priors for heterogeneity and also using moderately enthusiastic priors for treatment effects for high-flow nasal oxygen and skeptical priors for face mask noninvasive ventilation, based on measures of association and distributions obtained from recent evidence. 7,27,32 These latter sensitivity analyses were intended to account for a subgroup of clinicians who may have greater confidence in high-flow nasal oxygen compared with face mask noninvasive ventilation.

        <p>Twenty-five RCTs (3804 patients) were included in the analysis of endotracheal intubation, of which 1 RCT (47 patients) did not report any intubation events in any of the treatment groups. 37 All studies were unblinded for this outcome, and the risk of bias for this outcome was assessed as high due to potential cointerventions and variable criteria for endotracheal intubation between groups. The overall risk of bias assessed across all domains was deemed to be high for 7 (28%) and unclear for 18 (72%) of the 25 trials included (eTable 3 in the Supplement).Twenty-five RCTs (3804 patients) were included in the analysis of endotracheal intubation, of which 1 RCT (47 patients) did not report any intubation events in any of the treatment groups. 37 All studies were unblinded for this outcome, and the risk of bias for this outcome was assessed as high due to potential cointerventions and variable criteria for endotracheal intubation between groups.

        <p>For the primary outcome, the observed association between face mask noninvasive ventilation and reduced risk of mortality was no longer significant when considering studies that included only patients with more severe respiratory failure (mean PaO 2 :FIO 2 ratio &lt;200), when using noninformative priors for heterogeneity, and after excluding studies that enrolled any patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with congestive heart failure, or who were in the postoperative period (eTable 6 in the Supplement). However, the association of helmet ventilation with a lower risk of mortality remained significant across all sensitivity analyses. For the secondary outcome, all noninvasive ventilation strategies remained significantly associated with reduced risk of intubation across multiple sensitivity analyses when compared with standard oxygen therapy. Finally, the analyses restricted to studies with low risk of bias yielded results similar to the main analysis for all comparisons (eTables 6 and 7 in the Supplement). The overall results were robust when the analyses considered moderately optimistic priors that high-flow nasal oxygen would be associated with benefit and skeptical priors that face mask ventilation would be associated with harm.

        <p>The results of this study exhibit the potential benefit of delivering noninvasive ventilation using a helmet interface to patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, although the low certainty should be considered when interpreting these results. These findings are consistent with a recent systematic review and traditional pairwise meta-analysis that showed that use of helmet noninvasive ventilation was associated with decreased risk of intubation and mortality compared with other modalities. 13 However, in addition to not including indirect evidence, this previous study included both randomized and observational studies and included studies primary targeting patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The results of this network meta-analysis also raise the question of whether helmet noninvasive ventilation and face mask noninvasive ventilation should be considered distinct therapeutic interventions with potentially different physiological and clinical effects. Physiological studies have shown that the helmet interface decreases air leaks compared with the face mask interface; decreased air leaks may allow for more effective delivery of higher levels of positive end-expiratory pressure, potentially increasing alveolar recruitment and decreasing respiratory effort. 3,[52][53][54] Patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure may also have better tolerance for a helmet interface compared with other strategies, minimizing interruptions in therapy. Network geometry shows nodes as interventions and each head-to-head direct comparison as lines connecting these nodes. There is no direct comparison between high-flow nasal oxygen and helmet noninvasive ventilation for any of the study outcomes. The size of the nodes is proportional to the number of participants in each node. The thickness of the connecting line is proportional to the number of randomized clinical trials in each comparison. Both network plots include 1 study (n = 47) that did not report any event of death or intubation and 1 three-group study (face mask noninvasive ventilation, high-flow nasal oxygen, and standard oxygen therapy). Therefore, the total number of comparisons is higher than the number of randomized clinical trials for each outcome. Patients may be included in multiple comparisons, and this is accounted within the bayesian model and does not mean participants are duplicated. The finding that face mask noninvasive ventilation was associated with a lower rate of overall mortality and endotracheal intubation when compared with standard oxygen therapy needs to be assessed in the context of the uncertainty existing in the literature and relatively small sample size of included studies. It is possible that this association is driven by inclusion of patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure who also have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and/or congestive heart failure; face mask noninvasive ventilation has been demonstrated to be helpful in these situations. 21,[55][56][57][58][59] In the sensitivity analyses excluding trials that included such patients, the association with decreased mortality was no longer observed.The results of this study exhibit the potential benefit of delivering noninvasive ventilation using a helmet interface to patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, although the low certainty should be considered when interpreting these results.

        <p>Concerns regarding the safety of face mask noninvasive ventilation for patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure have been raised based on associations with increased mortality in large observational studies in patients with acute re-spiratory distress syndrome. 27,60 Clinicians who believe that face mask noninvasive ventilation may be harmful for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure might consider the sensitivity analysis using skeptical priors, in which face mask ventilation was no longer associated with a lower risk of intubation and mortality when compared with standard oxygen therapy and might even be associated with increased harm when compared with high-flow nasal oxygen therapy. Potential mechanisms for such harm include higher-than-targeted tidal volumes while patients breathe spontaneously, leading to high transpulmonary pressures and patient self-inflicted lung injury. 60,61 Although these potential harms might be especially important for face mask noninvasive ventilation, they may be common to all noninvasive oxygenation strategies, particularly by further delaying intubation and perpetuating lung injury in patients with high respiratory effort. [61][62][63] This might be especially relevant for more severely ill patients. A, For the primary outcome, all-cause mortality, the longest follow-up was up to 90 days. B, For the secondary outcome, intubation, the longest follow-up was up to 30 days. All outcomes are reported as network risk ratios and absolute risk differences with 95% credible intervals (CrIs). The certainty for each network meta-analysis estimate was estimated based on the 4-step approach suggested by the GRADE Working Group. Initially, each direct and indirect comparison was rated independently using the GRADE approach (risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision), and these were used to rate the network estimate. In case of disagreement between the direct and indirect rating, the network estimate was assigned the higher rating. In the presence of incoherence, the network estimate was assigned the lower rating of the direct/indirect assessment. For estimating risk ratios for the comparison of helmet noninvasive ventilation vs high-flow nasal cannula, only indirect evidence was used because no direct pairwise comparisons were available.Concerns regarding the safety of face mask noninvasive ventilation for patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure have been raised based on associations with increased mortality in large observational studies in patients with acute re-spiratory distress syndrome. 27,60 Clinicians who believe that face mask noninvasive ventilation may be harmful for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure might consider the sensitivity analysis using skeptical priors, in which face mask ventilation was no longer associated with a lower risk of intubation and mortality when compared with standard oxygen therapy and might even be associated with increased harm when compared with high-flow nasal oxygen therapy.

        <p>The association between noninvasive oxygenation strategies and lower mortality was less apparent in the sensitivity analysis restricted to patients with more severe hypoxemia.

        <p>The results of this study also showed a significant association with a lower risk of intubation but not mortality with the use of high-flow nasal oxygen when compared with standard oxygen therapy. These findings are consistent with other recent systematic reviews. 14,15 However, the sensitivity analysis using optimistic priors suggested there may still be a potential benefit of high-flow nasal oxygen in reducing mortality. Overall, these discordant conclusions reinforce the need for additional RCTs of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy to treat acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.The results of this study also showed a significant association with a lower risk of intubation but not mortality with the use of high-flow nasal oxygen when compared with standard oxygen therapy.

        <p>This study has several limitations. First, an assumption of the network meta-analysis is that the individual trials enrolled similar populations and that the intervention protocols were also similar across different studies. The analyses demonstrated only minimal incoherence, specifically in the comparison of high-flow nasal oxygen vs face mask noninvasive ventilation, which could be partially explained by the influence of 1 large trial and the partial inclusion of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure. 7 Trials that predominantly targeted patients with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or congestive heart failure were excluded, but several trials in this network meta-analysis included some of these patients, potentially leading to an overestimation of the beneficial effect of noninvasive ventilation strategies for patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. 6,39,44 However, the overall findings, in particular for endotracheal intubation, were consistent in sensitivity analyses that excluded these trials.This study has several limitations.

        <p>Third, this study included patients with a range of severity of respiratory failure (based on baseline PaO 2 :FIO 2 ratio), representing a source of potential intransitivity. However, the relative effects of interventions can remain consistent even in the case of different baseline risk of the outcomes. 64 Fourth, although helmet noninvasive ventilation had a higher probability to be ranked first, these findings should be assessed with caution. The use of rank probabilities might seem intuitive for clinicians but does not consider the certainty of the evidence, which was deemed to be low for comparisons with helmet noninvasive ventilation. Indeed, the studies evaluating the effectiveness of this intervention were scarce and included a small number of participants when compared with other strategies. 29 Therefore, uncertainty remains about the effectiveness of this treatment.Third, this study included patients with a range of severity of respiratory failure (based on baseline PaO 2 :FIO 2 ratio), representing a source of potential intransitivity.
