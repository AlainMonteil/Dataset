        <p>This is a PDF file of an article that has undergone enhancements after acceptance, such as the addition of a cover page and metadata, and formatting for readability, but it is not yet the definitive version of record. This version will undergo additional copyediting, typesetting and review before it is published in its final form, but we are providing this version to give early visibility of the article.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), an infection due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that may cause interstitial pneumonia and respiratory failure, has currently taken on pandemic proportions. 1 COVID-19 outbreak has emerged in Wuhan (China) and has rapidly spread to Europe, particularly to Italy 2 , where, as of to date (April 1, 2020), 80572 people have tested positive. 3 Two recent publications have brought attention to COVID-19-associated cutaneous manifestations. 4,5 Joob et al. reported on a dengue-like petechial rash in a COVID-19 patient from Thailand. 4 Recalcati described 18 out of 88 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the Lecco Hospital (Lombardy region, Italy) who developed erythematous rash (n=14), widespread urticaria (n=3) or varicella-like vesicles (n=1). 5 During the Italian outbreak, we have observed a varicella-like papulovesicular exanthem as a rare but specific COVID-19-associated skin manifestation. Eight Italian Dermatology Units collected clinical data of patients with COVID-19 (microbiologically proven by nasopharyngeal swab) and no history of new medications in the previous 15 days who developed varicella-like lesions.</p>
        <p>Demographic and clinical features of the 22 patients are summarized in Table 1.</p>
        <p>Male patients were 72.7% (n=16/22) and the median age was 60 years. Most patients (n=17/22; 77.3%) came from Lombardy, currently the worst-hit region in Italy, while the remaining patients came from Piedmont (n=1), Emilia-Romagna (n=1), Toscana (n=1), Lazio (n=1), and Campania (n=1).</p>
        <p>Median latency time from systemic symptoms to exanthem was three days (range from -2 to 12 days). Median duration of skin manifestations was eight days (range= 4 -15 days). Lesions were scattered in most cases (n=16; 72.7%), while they were diffuse in six (27.3%) cases. Predominance of vesicles was observed in 12 (54.5%) patients. No variations in the papulovesicular presentation were observed in our case series. Trunk was constantly involved, in some cases in association with limbs (n=4; 18.2%). (Fig. 1a-d) No facial or mucosal involvements were scored. Itching, which was generally mild, was reported in nine (40.9%) patients. In all the patients who underwent skin biopsy (n=7), histology was consistent with viral infection. (Fig. 1e-f) Most common systemic symptoms were fever (n=21/22; 95.5%), followed by cough (n=16; 72.7%), headache (n=11; 50%), weakness (n=11; 50%), coryza (n=10; 45.5%), dyspnea (n=9; 40.9%), hyposmia (n=4; 18.2%), hypogeusia (n=4; 18.2%), pharyngodynia (n=1; 4.5%), diarrhea (n=1; 4.5%), myalgia (n=1; 4.5%). Death occurred in three (13.6%) patients.</p>
        <p>Ours is the first series on this varicella-like exanthem as a specific COVID-19-associated cutaneous picture, unlike the non-specific cutaneous manifestations such as erythematous rash or urticaria reported by Recalcati. 5 Its typical features are constant trunk involvement, usually scattered distribution and mild/absent pruritus, the latter being in line with most viral exanthems but unlike true varicella. Lesions generally appear 3 days after systemic symptoms and disappear upon 8 days, without leaving scarring. A limitation of our study was missing histology in some cases. Moreover, demonstration of SARS-CoV-2 presence by Polymerase Chain Reaction in lesional skin was not possible due to specific primer unavailability. If further studies validate our findings, this early skin manifestation will represent a useful clue to suspect COVID-19 in asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic patients.</p>
