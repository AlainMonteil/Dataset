        <p>The evaluation of fetal growth is one of the key objectives of prenatal care. Fetal growth depends on several factors, including uteroplacental function, maternal disease, maternal cardiovascular function or cardiac disease, maternal nutrition, altitude, smoking and illicit drug use, and presence of pathological conditions, such as infection, aneuploidy and some genetic conditions. However, uteroplacental insufficiency or dysfunction represents one of the most frequent causes of abnormal growth in an otherwise normal fetus.The evaluation of fetal growth is one of the key objectives of prenatal care.

        <p>This Guideline provides definitions of FGR, previously referred to as intrauterine growth restriction, and SGA, and describes the best possible management options based on current data and knowledge. For the purposes of this Guideline, we assume that the pregnancy is singleton, pregnancy dating has been carried out correctly (preferably in the first trimester by ultrasound) and that there are no fetal pathologies, such as aneuploidy, congenital malformation or infection. Details of the grades of recommendation used in this Guideline are provided in Appendix 1. Reporting of levels of evidence is not applicable to this Guideline.This Guideline provides definitions of FGR, previously referred to as intrauterine growth restriction, and SGA, and describes the best possible management options based on current data and knowledge.

        <p>Fetal growth is a dynamic process and its assessment requires multiple observations of fetal size over time. Fetal size is determined through biometric evaluation of the head circumference, biparietal diameter, abdominal circumference (AC) and femur length and/or derivation of estimated fetal weight (EFW) computed by different formulae. The ISUOG Guidelines on ultrasound assessment of fetal biometry and growth describe methodology, reference ranges, growth standards and quality-control processes for appropriate assessment of fetal biometry and diagnosis of fetal growth disorders 6 . Controversies in relation to reference ranges and other issues related to the assessment of fetal biometry are described in this Guideline.Fetal growth is a dynamic process and its assessment requires multiple observations of fetal size over time.

        <p>A fetus is considered to be SGA when its size (biometric evaluation) falls below a predefined threshold for its gestational age. The most common definition of SGA is EFW or AC below the 10 th percentile of given reference ranges. Nevertheless, other thresholds have been described, such as the 5 th and 3 rd percentiles (the latter approximating to 2 SD) or a Z-score of -2.A fetus is considered to be SGA when its size (biometric evaluation) falls below a predefined threshold for its gestational age.

        <p>FGR is a condition that is frequently, but unhelpfully, defined as the fetus failing to reach its genetically predetermined growth potential. The identification of FGR is often not straightforward as fetal growth cannot be assessed through a single biometric evaluation of the fetal size, and growth potential is hypothetical.FGR is a condition that is frequently, but unhelpfully, defined as the fetus failing to reach its genetically predetermined growth potential. The identification of FGR is often not straightforward as fetal growth cannot be assessed through a single biometric evaluation of the fetal size, and growth potential is hypothetical.</p>
        <p>The main distinction between SGA and FGR is that a SGA fetus may be small but not at increased risk of adverse perinatal outcome, while a fetus with size above the 10 th percentile may be FGR and at increased risk of adverse perinatal and long-term outcome [7][8][9][10][11] .The main distinction between SGA and FGR is that a SGA fetus may be small but not at increased risk of adverse perinatal outcome, while a fetus with size above the 10 th percentile may be FGR and at increased risk of adverse perinatal and long-term outcome [7][8][9][10][11] .</p>
        <p>Fetuses with birth weight below the 10 th percentile are at increased risk of stillbirth 12 and perinatal mortality [13][14][15] , with those with birth weight below the 3 rd percentile being at the highest risk 12,13 . For this reason, fetal size at the lower extreme of the growth charts, for example AC or EFW below the 3 rd percentile for given growth charts, can be used as an isolated criterion to define FGR at any gestational epoch 16 . However, the optimal size at birth that is associated with the lowest perinatal mortality seems to be substantially higher than the median birth weight of a normal cohort 13 . In fact, a population-based cohort study found increased perinatal mortality even in fetuses with birth weight within the normal range, with those with birth weight between the 70 th and 90 th percentiles being at the lowest risk, and an inverse association between perinatal mortality and birth weight below the 80 th percentile 13 . A large Scottish population-based cohort study demonstrated a progressive increase in the risk of stillbirth in pregnancies with a predicted birth weight below the 25 th percentile 17 .Fetuses with birth weight below the 10 th percentile are at increased risk of stillbirth 12 and perinatal mortality [13][14][15] , with those with birth weight below the 3 rd percentile being at the highest risk 12,13 .

        <p>In order to differentiate between SGA and FGR in cases in which the fetal size is below the 10 th percentile, additional biophysical parameters are required. Many methods have been proposed for this purpose, such as evaluation of fetal growth velocity, use of customized growth charts, Doppler velocimetric evaluation of placental and fetal circulations and use of biomarkers. Some of these biophysical parameters are also used to monitor fetal status and/or as delivery decision criteria (e.g. umbilical artery (UA) Doppler). Biophysical tools, such as ductus venosus velocimetry, biophysical profile (BPP) scoring and cardiotocographic (CTG) assessment of fetal heart rate short-term variation (STV), are not used as diagnostic criteria for FGR but for the surveillance and management of pregnancies already diagnosed as FGR, and are discussed below.In order to differentiate between SGA and FGR in cases in which the fetal size is below the 10 th percentile, additional biophysical parameters are required.

        <p>There are several methods to evaluate fetal growth velocity, including use of longitudinal growth charts 18 , assessment of deviation from growth-velocity charts 18 and individualized growth assessment 19 . Overall, the objective is to evaluate the fetal growth trajectory and identify those fetuses that are deviating from their individual trajectory, indicating a failure to reach their growth potential. There is evidence to suggest that reduced fetal growth velocity in the third trimester is associated with increased risk of adverse outcome 11,20 . Reduced growth velocity is normally taken to be a fall between consecutive ultrasound scans of &gt; 50 percentiles for AC or, more commonly, EFW 6 .There are several methods to evaluate fetal growth velocity, including use of longitudinal growth charts 18 , assessment of deviation from growth-velocity charts 18 and individualized growth assessment 19 .

        <p>In customized charts, the fetal weight and growth are adjusted for variables known to impact fetal size. These can include maternal height, weight, age, parity and ethnicity and fetal sex. Adjustment for these variables is suggested to allow for better identification of SGA fetuses at risk of perinatal complications 6 .

        <p>The rationale behind the application of Doppler velocimetry in fetal growth assessment is that it can identify uteroplacental function through evaluation of the uterine and umbilical arteries. Uteroplacental insufficiency is putatively mediated through spiral artery maladaptation and alterations in the villous vascular tree. On the fetal side, Doppler velocimetry allows evaluation of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and ductus venosus as fetal cardiovascular adaptation progresses from hypoxia to acidemia.The rationale behind the application of Doppler velocimetry in fetal growth assessment is that it can identify uteroplacental function through evaluation of the uterine and umbilical arteries.

        <p>A lack of physiological transformation of the uterine arteries from high-to low-resistance vessels is thought to reflect inadequate trophoblastic invasion of the spiral arteries, leaving a high-resistance circulation.

        <p>Progressively increasing PI in the UA corresponds to a progressive reduction in the placental surface area available for gas and nutrient exchange and increased fetal afterload resistance, and is associated with placental vascular insufficiency reflected by absent and, in the end-stage phase, reversed end-diastolic flow (EDF) in the UA 22 .Progressively increasing PI in the UA corresponds to a progressive reduction in the placental surface area available for gas and nutrient exchange and increased fetal afterload resistance, and is associated with placental vascular insufficiency reflected by absent and, in the end-stage phase, reversed end-diastolic flow (EDF) in the UA 22 .</p>
        <p>Reduced fetal MCA-PI is a consequence of vasodilatation, the so called 'brain-sparing' effect. This represents a hemodynamic response to fetal hypoxemia, via direct vascular sensing of oxygen tension in the cerebral circuit, and in other vascular beds a consequent redistribution of fetal cardiac output occurs preferentially to the coronary arteries and adrenal glands 23 .Reduced fetal MCA-PI is a consequence of vasodilatation, the so called 'brain-sparing' effect.

        <p>Alterations in the ductus venosus flow velocity waveform, especially absent or reversed a-wave, are caused by progressive dilatation of the ductus venosus isthmus in order to increase the blood flow toward the heart, in an attempt to compensate for extreme oxygen deprivation 24 .

        <p>The BPP score consists of the combined evaluation of fetal tone, gross body movement, breathing movement, amniotic fluid volume and heart-rate reactivity. BPP score can predict both fetal pH and outcome 26,27 . The relationship between altered BPP score and fetal pH seems to be consistent across gestational ages 26 . A score of ≤ 4 is associated with a fetal pH ≤ 7.20, while a score of &lt; 2 has a sensitivity of 100% for acidemia 27 .

        <p>A reactive CTG virtually excludes fetal hypoxemia. The fetal heart rate STV is a biophysical parameter obtained by computerized CTG (cCTG) that reflects autonomic nervous system function. In the context of FGR and the accompanying presence of severe hypoxemia or hypoxia, the fetal sympathetic and parasympathetic activity is altered, resulting in reduced fetal heart rate variation, and, thus, reduced STV. cCTG and evaluation of STV have been validated against invasive testing in fetal hypoxemia and acidemia and represent the only objective measure of fetal heart rate 29 . Visual inspection of conventional CTG does not provide the same information as cCTG, as CTG represents a largely subjective assessment with low intraand interobserver reproducibility.A reactive CTG virtually excludes fetal hypoxemia.

        <p>There are two main phenotypes of FGR which differ significantly in many aspects, such as prevalence, prediction by first-trimester ultrasound, gestational age at onset, placental histopathological findings, Doppler velocimetric profile, maternal associated disease, severity and perinatal outcome. Table 1 presents the main characteristics of the two phenotypes, which are defined as early-onset and late-onset FGR based on the observation that one phenotype is more frequent in early gestation and the second near term [39][40][41][42] . The distinction between early and late FGR is usually based on diagnosis before or after 32-34 weeks' gestation. Although UA Doppler evaluation seems to discriminate better than gestational age between the two phenotypes of FGR with regards to their association with pre-eclampsia and adverse perinatal outcome 39,40 , 32 weeks seems to be the optimal gestational-age cut-off at diagnosis and provides a reasonable classification of the two FGR phenotypes 40 . This gestational-age threshold, therefore, is largely agreed upon as the main criterion to differentiate between early and late FGR 16 and is used to distinguish between early-and late-onset FGR in this Guideline.There are two main phenotypes of FGR which differ significantly in many aspects, such as prevalence, prediction by first-trimester ultrasound, gestational age at onset, placental histopathological findings, Doppler velocimetric profile, maternal associated disease, severity and perinatal outcome.

        <p>There is considerable methodological heterogeneity in studies reporting reference ranges for MCA and UA Doppler indices and their ratio, which may, at least partly, explain the differences in reported reference ranges 46 . Even among studies with a high methodological quality score, there are significant differences in the definition of 'normality' and normal ranges 46 . A recent study evaluating the 10 most-cited articles providing reference ranges for MCA-PI, UA-PI and cerebroplacental ratio (CPR), found wide discrepancies in Doppler reference values that accounted for a variability of up to 50% in the 5 th percentile cut-off value of MCA-PI at term 47 . Similarly, the study found significant differences in the cut-off for UA-PI above the 95 th percentile (20-40%) and CPR below the 5 th percentile (15-35%) 47 . Wide discrepancies have been reported in reference ranges used for biometry, Doppler parameters and birth weight, even at national level in centers with high expertise in the management of FGR, that might significantly impact the diagnosis and management of FGR 48 .There is considerable methodological heterogeneity in studies reporting reference ranges for MCA and UA Doppler indices and their ratio, which may, at least partly, explain the differences in reported reference ranges 46 .

        <p>Another reason for the lack of standardization of quantitative Doppler velocimetry is that there is no uniformity in Doppler indices that are used, especially in research studies. For example, cerebral blood-flow redistribution can be defined as MCA-PI below different percentile thresholds (5 th or 10 th percentile), Z-scores or multiples of the median (MoM), or it can be defined as umbilicocerebral ratio (UCR) or CPR above or below different percentile thresholds, Z-scores or MoM, respectively 49 . The Delphi consensus procedure identified CPR below the 5 th percentile and UA-PI above the 95 th percentile as Doppler criteria to define FGR 16 . The rationale behind the application of the ratios of MCA-PI and UA-PI (CPR and UCR), instead of the individual components, is that they have been shown to be more sensitive to fetal hypoxia 50 and to be associated more strongly with adverse perinatal outcome 49,51 . CPR is reported in studies more frequently than is UCR. A recent study suggested that UCR may allow for better differentiation of cases in the abnormal range in early FGR, as compared with CPR 52 . However, it should be highlighted that there is no strong evidence in favor of either ratio.Another reason for the lack of standardization of quantitative Doppler velocimetry is that there is no uniformity in Doppler indices that are used, especially in research studies.

The rationale behind the application of the ratios of MCA-PI and UA-PI (CPR and UCR), instead of the individual components, is that they have been shown to be more sensitive to fetal hypoxia 50 and to be associated more strongly with adverse perinatal outcome 49,51 . CPR is reported in studies more frequently than is UCR. A recent study suggested that UCR may allow for better differentiation of cases in the abnormal range in early FGR, as compared with CPR 52 . However, it should be highlighted that there is no strong evidence in favor of either ratio.</p>
        <p>The high variability in Doppler reference ranges and indices used has a major clinical impact on prenatal diagnosis, monitoring, timing of delivery decision, reproducibility and comparison of findings between research studies, efficacy of clinical policies and protocols, and many other aspects 46 . The discussion about which reference ranges to use for the diagnosis and management of FGR is beyond the scope of this Guideline. However, these differences should be acknowledged and action is needed to homogenize the adoption of Doppler indices, thresholds and reference ranges in clinical and research practice.

        <p>Early FGR is particularly associated with maternal vascular malperfusion of the placenta, characterized by abnormal transformation of the spiral arteries, pathologic features of the placental villi and multifocal infarction; these disease components result in so-called 'placental insufficiency' and form the most common basis for placenta-mediated FGR 53,54 . Chronic ischemia of the placental villi impairs PlGF secretion and leads to excessive sFlt-1 release by syncytial knots, thus resulting in elevated sFlt-1/PlGF ratio which typifies early FGR and the associated hypertensive disorders of pregnancy [34][35][36][37][38] . Elevated Doppler UA-PI typically precedes a cascade of Doppler alterations, fetal heart rate changes and BPP modifications, with end-stage cardiovascular deterioration caused by severe hypoxemia followed by acidosis [55][56][57] . Uterine artery, UA and MCA Doppler abnormalities represent early changes in early FGR and may be present for many weeks before severe cardiovascular and metabolic deterioration occurs. Although absent UA-EDF represents a progressive deterioration of uteroplacental function, it still precedes critical fetal deterioration, and the progression to reversed UA-EDF might be slow. However, the rate and rapidity of alteration in UA Doppler, from increased blood-flow resistance to absent EDF, determines the rate of fetal deterioration 56,58 . The late deterioration in early FGR characterized by severe placental insufficiency is reflected by reversal of the EDF in the UA, and worsening generalized cardiovascular and metabolic failure reflected by alterations in the ductus venosus (absent or reversed a-wave) 57,59 . This cardiovascular deterioration might precede or occur in parallel with the alteration of the STV, eventually manifesting as abnormal BPP score, spontaneous repetitive decelerations on CTG and stillbirth 39,60 .Early FGR is particularly associated with maternal vascular malperfusion of the placenta, characterized by abnormal transformation of the spiral arteries, pathologic features of the placental villi and multifocal infarction; these disease components result in so-called 'placental insufficiency' and form the most common basis for placenta-mediated FGR 53,54 .

        <p>At present, there is no effective therapy for early FGR, though efficient recognition and management of severe pre-eclampsia may prolong some pregnancies with early FGR. The timely use of steroids, followed by magnesium sulfate, transfer to a tertiary care center and consideration of the safest mode of delivery, are the key concepts in early-FGR management 61 . Ultimately, delivery represents the only therapeutic option in early FGR, in order to prevent severe consequences from hypoxia and acidosis that can lead to perinatal morbidity and mortality. On the other hand, the decision to deliver has to be balanced against the possible harm caused by prematurity 62,63 . This is further complicated by the fact that the fetus is suffering from growth restriction, which is an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes associated with prematurity, thus making the outcome even more unfavorable 64,65 . This is highlighted by the fact that, in fetuses with early FGR, neonatal survival first exceeds 50% after 26 weeks' gestation, which is 2 weeks later than in their appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) counterparts 55 . In this view, optimal monitoring and timing of delivery are of crucial importance when managing early FGR.At present, there is no effective therapy for early FGR, though efficient recognition and management of severe pre-eclampsia may prolong some pregnancies with early FGR.

        <p>Once early FGR is suspected/diagnosed, the pregnancy should be monitored and managed in tertiary-level fetal medicine and neonatal units according to a uniform management protocol 66 . Multidisciplinary counseling by neonatology and maternal-fetal medicine specialists is important. Evidence from a randomized trial (Trial of Randomized Umbilical and Fetal Flow in Europe (TRUFFLE)) shows that monitoring and delivery timing according to a specific protocol including ductus venosus Doppler and cCTG provides better-than-expected outcomes 66 . It should be taken into account that cCTG is not available or used universally. In that case, in addition to Doppler evaluation, assessment of conventional CTG and, where undertaken, BPP scoring should be performed 27 .

        <p>MCA Doppler is one of the first parameters that becomes abnormal in early FGR. There seems to be a weak association between low MCA-PI and adverse short-term neonatal outcome and between low MCA-PI and high UCR and 2-year adverse neurodevelopmental outcome 52 . However, gestational age at delivery and birth weight have the most pronounced impact on these outcomes 52 . Thus, MCA Doppler seems to guide monitoring before 32 weeks of gestation but there is no evidence that it should be used to determine delivery timing.MCA Doppler is one of the first parameters that becomes abnormal in early FGR.

        <p>Around 70% of women with early FGR will develop hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, mainly pre-eclampsia 68 .

        <p>All available guidelines on early FGR recommend corticosteroid prophylaxis to prevent neonatal respiratory distress syndrome if the birth is likely to occur before 34 + 0 weeks 43,67,[70][71][72][73][74] .

Despite this recommendation, it is worth noting that no randomized trial has been performed in order to establish whether the benefits of corticosteroids in premature fetuses also apply to premature growth-restricted fetuses, in whom the reduced metabolism of corticosteroids by a smaller placenta and the already high level of endogenous adrenal corticosteroids might further damage the white matter of the brain and myelination 75 .

        <p>The TRUFFLE study is the largest randomized trial on timing of delivery in early FGR and was based on three randomization arms: early ductus venosus Doppler changes (PI &gt; 95 th percentile), late ductus venosus Doppler changes (a-wave at or below baseline) and reduced fetal heart rate STV on cCTG (&lt; 3.5 ms before 29 weeks and &lt; 4.0 ms thereafter) 83 . In addition, in all three arms, safety-net criteria were applied as an absolute indication for delivery, and were represented by spontaneous repeated persistent unprovoked fetal heart rate decelerations in all three arms or by STV &lt; 2.6 ms at 26 + 0 to 28 + 6 weeks and &lt; 3.0 ms at 29 + 0 to 31 + 6 weeks in the ductus venosus arms. The protocol recommended delivery if reversed UA-EDF occurred after 30 weeks or if there was absent UA-EDF after 32 weeks. Overall, the TRUFFLE study provided evidence that timing of delivery based on ductus venosus Doppler measurement in conjunction with cCTG safety-net criteria improves long-term (2-year) neurodevelopmental outcome in surviving infants. The cCTG STV 'safety net' was deliberately set at a level below that of the two ductus venosus randomized groups. Figure 1 presents the protocol recommended by the TRUFFLE study for monitoring and managing pregnancies with early FGR 66 . Despite the fact that data from the TRUFFLE study showed better-than-expected results in terms of infant survival without neurological impairment (82% of children), the gestational age at study entry and at delivery and birth weight were strongly related to adverse outcome.

        <p>If cCTG is not available or not used, delivery timing should be based on combination of Doppler velocimetry indices (mainly ductus venosus before 30 weeks) and conventional CTG, or BPP where this is undertaken.

However, when visually interpreting the fetal heart reactivity on conventional CTG, the gestational age and corresponding fetal maturity should be taken into account.

        <p>The pathophysiology of late FGR differs from that of early FGR. Late FGR is characterized by milder and more aspecific placental lesions and/or alteration in oxygen and nutrient diffusion 84,85 . Consequently, alterations in UA Doppler and venous districts are rare and fail to identify the vast majority of late-FGR cases or to predict adverse outcome in these fetuses 40 . Several studies have found an association between MCA vasodilatation (i.e. reduction in MCA-PI) or the alteration of its ratio with UA-PI and poorer perinatal outcome 86 , including stillbirth 39 , higher risk of Cesarean delivery [87][88][89] , and increased risk of abnormal neurodevelopment at birth 90 and at 2 years of age 91 . The rationale for using the ratios of MCA-PI and UA-PI (CPR and UCR) is that they can identify subtle changes between placental and cerebral blood-flow perfusion that may not be appreciated by evaluation of a single parameter. Furthermore, it has been suggested that evaluation of the CPR may improve the prediction of adverse perinatal outcome in growth-restricted fetuses [92][93][94] .The pathophysiology of late FGR differs from that of early FGR.

The pathophysiology of late FGR is still not completely understood and this may determine a lower identification rate of fetuses exposed to growth restriction near term 99 . Moreover, fetuses near term seem to have reduced tolerance to hypoxemia 100 , possibly because of their relatively high metabolic rate, compared with fetuses at an earlier gestation. Thus, frequent monitoring of pregnancies with late FGR is warranted in the same way as for those with early FGR.Despite presenting with milder clinical form than early FGR, late FGR is still associated with poor perinatal outcome 87,95 and longer-term educational attainment 91,96,97 .

        <p>The only randomized interventional trial on FGR at or close to term is the Disproportionate Intrauterine Growth Intervention Trial At Term (DIGITAT) study 102 . The study compared the effect of induction of labor vs expectant monitoring in singleton pregnancies beyond 36 + 0 weeks of gestation with suspected FGR. The study did not take into account any Doppler assessment and the only Doppler parameter reported was absent EDF in the UA (present in 14/650 pregnancies). The induction-of-labor policy, compared with expectant management, did not affect the rate of adverse neonatal outcome or neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcome at 2 years of age, except for in children with birth weight below the 2.3 rd percentile 103 . Moreover, it did not affect the rates of instrumental vaginal delivery and Cesarean section. In the induction-of-labor group, more neonates were admitted to intermediate-level care, but this outcome was reduced when considering only induction after 38 weeks of gestation 104 . Importantly, the proportion of neonates with birth weight below the 3 rd percentile was greater in the expectant-monitoring arm, as was the proportion of women who developed pre-eclampsia. Based on these findings, it would appear that induction of labor for suspected FGR after 38 weeks' gestation is not associated with increased incidence of instrumental vaginal delivery or Cesarean section, or adverse neonatal or 2-year child outcome, while it seems to be associated with decreased incidence of neonates with extremely low birth weight and of progression to pre-eclampsia. Of note, fetuses at term with birth weight below the 3 rd percentile have the highest risk of stillbirth, approximately 1:100 12 , hence these pregnancies should not exceed 37 + 6 weeks of gestation, independent of Doppler findings. All cases of stillbirth in the DIGITAT trial occurred among women who, despite meeting the inclusion criteria, declined to participate (approximately 1%, pers. comm.). This stresses the importance of monitoring growth-restricted fetuses at or near term, and timely delivery.The only randomized interventional trial on FGR at or close to term is the Disproportionate Intrauterine Growth Intervention Trial At Term (DIGITAT) study 102 .

Based on these findings, it would appear that induction of labor for suspected FGR after 38 weeks' gestation is not associated with increased incidence of instrumental vaginal delivery or Cesarean section, or adverse neonatal or 2-year child outcome, while it seems to be associated with decreased incidence of neonates with extremely low birth weight and of progression to pre-eclampsia. Of note, fetuses at term with birth weight below the 3 rd percentile have the highest risk of stillbirth, approximately 1:100 12 , hence these pregnancies should not exceed 37 + 6 weeks of gestation, independent of Doppler findings. All cases of stillbirth in the DIGITAT trial occurred among women who, despite meeting the inclusion criteria, declined to participate (approximately 1%, pers. comm.). This stresses the importance of monitoring growth-restricted fetuses at or near term, and timely delivery.</p>
        <p>In pregnancies with late FGR and UA-PI above the 95 th percentile, expert opinion is that delivery should be considered when the gestation is beyond 36 + 0 weeks and not later than 37 + 6 weeks 105 .In pregnancies with late FGR and UA-PI above the 95 th percentile, expert opinion is that delivery should be considered when the gestation is beyond 36 + 0 weeks and not later than 37 + 6 weeks 105 .</p>
        <p>Though cerebral redistribution is associated with adverse short-and long-term perinatal outcome 49,[106][107][108] , there is currently no evidence as to how cerebral Doppler should be utilized in the delivery timing of FGR. However, it seems reasonable that, in pregnancies with late FGR and signs of cerebral blood-flow redistribution, delivery should be considered at around 38 + 0 weeks and not later than 38 + 6 weeks. It is important that each unit predisposes and follows a precise dedicated monitoring protocol, based also on local experience and resources.Though cerebral redistribution is associated with adverse short-and long-term perinatal outcome 49,[106][107][108] , there is currently no evidence as to how cerebral Doppler should be utilized in the delivery timing of FGR.

        <p>Considering that the major cause of perinatal death at term is stillbirth and that some SGA fetuses might suffer some degree of stunted growth that is not adequately identified by current biophysical tools, it is reasonable to consider delivery after 38 + 0 weeks of gestation, and the pregnancy should not exceed 39 + 0 weeks, in order to reduce the risk of severe growth restriction or stillbirth in fetuses identified as SGA.

        <p>The Delphi consensus on the criteria for FGR diagnosis 16 is of importance as it has established a uniform definition of early and late FGR. However, it is still not clear whether a proportion of fetuses with AC or EFW below the 10 th percentile (namely SGA) with normal umbilical and cerebral Doppler indices might suffer from stunted fetal growth as suggested by recent findings 110,121 . This question warrants further exploration. It is hypothesized that even before the signs of hypoxemia establish, there is a 'preclinical' phase during which the fetus is exposed to a reduced supply of nutrients and oxygen to which it responds by reduced growth and oxidative metabolism.The Delphi consensus on the criteria for FGR diagnosis 16 is of importance as it has established a uniform definition of early and late FGR.

        <p>There are several hypotheses regarding the underlying pathophysiological processes of fetal growth impairment, such as inadequate maternal perfusion of the uterus due to overrun of the maternal hemodynamic adaptation potential, overrun of the placental potential in response to increasing fetal needs, or placental senescence due to oxidative stress. It may be that UA Doppler alterations and signs of cerebral blood-flow redistribution are not sophisticated enough to capture and discriminate these imbalances between fetal needs and maternal and/or placental potential before hypoxemia establishes. In this respect, more efforts should be made to identify potential predictors of the subgroup of SGA fetuses that is at increased risk of perinatal and long-term adverse outcomes. New emerging biophysical and biochemical tools, such as alternative analysis of fetal heart rate acceleration and deceleration parameters 122 , evaluation of maternal hemodynamics 113 , evaluation of umbilical vein blood-flow volume 85,112,123 and even assessment of uterine blood-flow volume 124,125 could help to disentangle the different aspects of SGA and FGR. The finding that sFlt-1/PlGF ratio can predict the short-term presence or absence of pre-eclampsia 33 opens the possibility that placental protein markers can offer considerably enhanced screening test precision to distinguish the healthy SGA fetus from the fetus with placenta-mediated FGR that is at risk of stillbirth and asphyxia-related morbidity. In women with hypertensive disorders, the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio has been shown to be able to differentiate cases with pre-eclampsia and SGA from those with pre-eclampsia and AGA fetuses 126 , and this should be explored further in pregnant patients monitored for SGA and/or FGR 34 .There are several hypotheses regarding the underlying pathophysiological processes of fetal growth impairment, such as inadequate maternal perfusion of the uterus due to overrun of the maternal hemodynamic adaptation potential, overrun of the placental potential in response to increasing fetal needs, or placental senescence due to oxidative stress.

        <p>Early FGR is associated with complications related to prematurity, as preterm birth is often necessitated to prevent stillbirth. There is a strong desire to delay progression of the condition once the diagnosis is made. Attempts have been made by several research groups (STRIDER (Sildenafil TheRapy In Dismal prognosis Early-onset intrauterine growth Restriction) consortium) to evaluate the role of sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase Type-5 inhibitor, in improving the outcome of fetuses with early FGR. It is believed that its potential vasodilatory effect on the uterine vessels might improve fetal growth in utero. The UK-based randomized placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that administration of sildenafil at a dose of 25 mg three times daily (n = 70) vs placebo (n = 65) does not prolong the pregnancy or improve outcomes in severe early-onset FGR diagnosed between 22 + 0 and 29 + 6 weeks of gestation 127 . A similar trial from New Zealand and Australia, including 122 cases of early FGR, demonstrated that maternal use of sildenafil has no effect on fetal growth velocity 128 . Significant concerns regarding the safety of sildenafil during pregnancy were raised following an excess of neonatal deaths due to pulmonary hypertension in one trial based in The Netherlands, and it is currently recommended that sildenafil should not be used in FGR outside the setting of high-quality randomized clinical trials 129 .Early FGR is associated with complications related to prematurity, as preterm birth is often necessitated to prevent stillbirth.

The EVERREST (doEs Vascular endothelial growth factor gene therapy safEly impRove outcome in seveRe Early-onset fetal growth reSTriction?) group 125 is planning an uncontrolled open-label trial in pregnancies affected by early FGR in order to evaluate the efficacy of localized injected maternal vascular endothelial growth factor gene therapy to improve fetal growth. Given that high maternal vascular resistance and low cardiac output are characteristic in early FGR, vasodilator agents and increasing intravascular volume have been suggested to improve fetal growth and prolong gestation 130 . Importantly, therapies for maternal hypertension that reduce cardiac output, such as beta blockers, have been linked to poor perinatal outcome and stillbirth and should be used with caution in these cases.Several novel approaches are being investigated for improving the outcome of pregnancies with early-onset FGR.

        <p>Besides the need for homogeneous application of Doppler indices, thresholds and reference ranges, the question regarding their clinical utility for monitoring of and timing delivery in FGR pregnancies diagnosed &gt; 32 weeks' gestation is still to be answered. The evidence of association between signs of cerebral blood-flow redistribution and adverse pregnancy outcome is based mainly on retrospective and observational studies, in which the application of Doppler indices might have influenced pregnancy management and outcome, and therefore introduced bias. Currently, there is no randomized interventional trial on the utility of Doppler parameters in timing delivery in late FGR. Thus, the key research question is whether early delivery of fetuses with late FGR and signs of cerebral blood-flow redistribution is beneficial (by removing the fetus from exposure to a hostile environment and hypoxemia) or harmful (by inducing late prematurity). A study of this kind should address the issues of perinatal morbidity and mortality, as well as long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Moreover, it is not clear which monitoring policy is most beneficial and which Doppler parameters and thresholds perform best in late FGR. Ongoing randomized controlled trials on this topic will provide answers to these important questions.Besides the need for homogeneous application of Doppler indices, thresholds and reference ranges, the question regarding their clinical utility for monitoring of and timing delivery in FGR pregnancies diagnosed &gt; 32 weeks' gestation is still to be answered.

        <p>Early diagnosis, close follow-up and timely delivery of pregnancies with FGR are of crucial importance for perinatal short-and long-term outcome. The identification of FGR is not always straightforward, for several reasons. First, a single biometric measurement of fetal size is not sufficient to evaluate fetal growth, except perhaps in the case of extremely small fetal size. Thus, additional biophysical tools and/or evaluations are needed in order to identify FGR. Second, there are two phenotypes of FGR that differ significantly in many aspects. Knowledge of the clinical manifestation and progress of early-onset and late-onset FGR is of crucial importance for all aspects of management (from diagnosis to delivery). At present, the most recognized criteria to define early and late FGR are those derived from an international Delphi survey consensus 16 .Early diagnosis, close follow-up and timely delivery of pregnancies with FGR are of crucial importance for perinatal short-and long-term outcome.

        <p>Once the diagnosis of FGR has been made, multimodality assessment (including Doppler velocimetry, cCTG and BPP), which may differ between countries, is recommended. Early FGR is associated more strongly with abnormal trophoblastic invasion and consequent placental insufficiency. The risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity and long-term adverse outcome is very high in these pregnancies, and depends both on the severity of growth restriction and prematurity. For this reason, pregnancies with early FGR should be managed in multidisciplinary tertiary-level units. Despite the severity of early FGR, the cascade of Doppler alterations is quite well-known and randomized controlled trials have provided a robust level of evidence for delivery criteria.Once the diagnosis of FGR has been made, multimodality assessment (including Doppler velocimetry, cCTG and BPP), which may differ between countries, is recommended.

        <p>Late FGR has a milder clinical presentation than does early FGR, and hence, it is not associated with severe prematurity but can still be associated with significant morbidity. Despite that, at present, the diagnosis and management of late FGR, especially near term, is complex. The assessment of MCA-PI and its ratios to UA-PI have a central role in the identification of late FGR. However, there is no clear evidence as to whether the decision to deliver based on Doppler evaluation of cerebral blood-flow redistribution might be beneficial in terms of short-and long-term neurodevelopmental outcome and which is the optimal gestational age at which to deliver these pregnancies.Late FGR has a milder clinical presentation than does early FGR, and hence, it is not associated with severe prematurity but can still be associated with significant morbidity.
