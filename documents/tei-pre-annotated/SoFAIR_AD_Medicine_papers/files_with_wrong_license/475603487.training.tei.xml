        <p>Epidemiology A timeline of the outbreak is summarized in Table 1. As of April 11, 2020, 1,610,909 confirmed cases worldwide have been reported. 4 Early investigations reported a basic reproductive number (R 0 ) ranging between 1.4 and 3.9, while a mean incubation period of 5.2 days 5 ranging between 1 and 14 days. 6 According to the World Health Organization, 4 the current estimated global mortality is 99,690 (6.19% of confirmed cases) (Fig), the proportion of which may vary based on demographics of a location. All ages are susceptible to infection, and viral shedding may occur in asymptomatic individuals. 7 The risk factors for poor prognosis include advancing age and comorbidities, 8 while mortality is associated with age, high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and D-dimer levels of &gt;1 mg/mL on admission. 9Epidemiology A timeline of the outbreak is summarized in Table 1.

        <p>Current evidence indicates an initial animal-to-human transmission from wild animals traded at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. The origin and mechanism of which remain to be clarified-while some genomic studies suggested bats as the natural reservoir, 16 others suggested pangolins. 17 As the outbreak progressed, person-to-person transmission remains the main mode of spread. This is through (1) respiratory droplets released via coughing or sneezing, (2) aerosol, typically during aerosolgenerating clinical procedures, and (3) mucosal membrane contact with fomites. 18,19 Faecal-oral transmission has been speculated, 20 given the detection of viral RNA in stools, reported gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, and ACE2 expression along the GI-tract. 21 No evidence of intrauterine or transplacental transmission has been reported.

        <p>In a study that analyzed 138 COVID-19 patients, 25 the most common clinical features were fever (99%), fatigue (70%), dry cough (59%), anorexia (40%), myalgias (40%), dyspnea (31%), and sputum production (27%). Other cohort studies have reported a similar range of clinical findings. 3,[26][27][28] However, fever might not be a universal finding, with 1 study reporting only 20% of their patients with very low grade fever (&lt;100.4˚F/38˚C) and another 2 reporting fever in 44% of patients. Headache, sore throat and rhinorrhea have also been noted as less common symptoms. 29 Although not highlighted in the aforementioned studies, anosmia and dysgeusia (smell and taste disorders) have been reported as well (Table 2). 29In a study that analyzed 138 COVID-19 patients, 25 the most common clinical features were fever (99%), fatigue (70%), dry cough (59%), anorexia (40%), myalgias (40%), dyspnea (31%), and sputum production (27%).

        <p>The most frequent, serious manifestation of COVID-19 infection seems to be pneumonia, which is characterized by cough, fever, dyspnea and bilateral infiltrates displayed on radiographic chest imaging. Unfortunately, there are no specific clinical features that discern COVID-19 from other viral respiratory illnesses. 29 Although most patients will only experience mild symptoms of the disease, some patients will experience rapid progression of their symptoms over the span of a week (Table 3). 3,25 One study 30 found that 17% of their patients developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and among these, 65% rapidly worsened and died from multiple organ failure. In a study focusing on the associated risk factors, 31 it was reported that ARDS was greatly associated with older age (&gt;65 years old), diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. For most cases, bilateral lower zone consolidation (identified through chest x-ray) peaked at 10-12 days from symptom onset. 32The most frequent, serious manifestation of COVID-19 infection seems to be pneumonia, which is characterized by cough, fever, dyspnea and bilateral infiltrates displayed on radiographic chest imaging.

        <p>COVID-19 infection shares similar radiological features 33 to those of other viral pneumonia. 34 The hallmarks of COVID-19 on computed topography imaging are bilateral and peripheral ground-glass opacities, and consolidative pulmonary opacities. Crazy paving patterns have also been observed. 27 A staging system for using computed topography images has been reported 33 and is summarized in Table 4.COVID-19 infection shares similar radiological features 33 to those of other viral pneumonia. 34 The hallmarks of COVID-19 on computed topography imaging are bilateral and peripheral ground-glass opacities, and consolidative pulmonary opacities.

        <p>Patients with existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) are at a greater risk of suffering from severe COVID-19 and having poorer prognosis. A meta-analysis comprising of 46,248 patients with confirmed COVID-19 found that the most common co-morbidities were hypertension (17%), diabetes (8%), and CVD (5%). 36 CVD and hypertension have also been more prevalent in the severe patient group as compared to non-severe cases (odds ratio of 3.42 and 2.36, respectively). 36 Existing CVD is also associated with higher mortality which is summarized in Table 5. 16 On the other hand, it is widely agreed that COVID-19 can also have adverse effects on cardiovascular health itself, causing or aggravating damage to the heart. There are reports of cardiogenic involvement in patients without known CVD 37 as well as cases with solely cardiac presentations. 38,39 Mechanism of Cardiovascular InvolvementPatients with existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) are at a greater risk of suffering from severe COVID-19 and having poorer prognosis.

        <p>The exact mechanism of cardiovascular involvement in COVID- 19 is not yet well understood, however elevated cardiac biomarker levels are commonly seen. In a study by Wang et al, 7.2% of patients had either elevated troponin levels or new electrocardiography or echocardiography abnormalities suggestive of cardiac injury. 25 ACE2 is highly expressed in the heart, providing opportunity for ACE2-dependent myocardial infection. Cytokine storm from systemic inflammation and the hypoxic state from ARDS inducing excessive extracellular calcium levels leading to myocyte apoptosis are also possible mechanisms of damage. 40 Surge in cytokine levels due to hyperinflammatory response or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and increased myocardial demand in the setting of acute infection can lead to atherosclerotic plaque instability and myocardial injury, increasing the risk of acute myocardial infarction. 41 Blood pressure abnormalities can also be seen in response to the illness. 41 Additionally, palpitations due to arrhythmia have been observed. 41,42 The type of arrhythmias are variable and etiology can be multi-factorial, ranging from hypoxic state due to ARDS to myocarditis. 41 Hu et al and Zeng et al also reported patients with reduced ejection fraction and heart enlargement. 39,43 Therefore, possible long-term effects of COVID-19 on cardiovascular system such as risk of heart failure should be considered and further investigated.The exact mechanism of cardiovascular involvement in COVID- 19 is not yet well understood, however elevated cardiac biomarker levels are commonly seen.

        <p>Effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers on COVID-19 susceptibility and prognosis have been controversial. Some evidence suggests that increasing ACE2 expressions facilitate COVID-19 infection, 44 while others suggest potential beneficial effects of reducing lung injury. 45 Therefore, changes to their standard indications on the basis of COVID-19 is not currently recommended. 40Effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers on COVID-19 susceptibility and prognosis have been controversial.

        <p>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the abrupt loss of kidney function that develops within 7 days.

        <p>Although the exact pathogenesis of kidney involvement in COVID-19 infection is unclear, it is reported that AKI in COVID-19 accompanies sepsis, multiorgan failure and shock, suggesting the cause of AKI to be acute tubular necrosis. 29 Alternatively, a study based on single-cell transcriptome analysis 47 proved ACE2 receptor expression in kidney cells, suggesting the plausibility of direct renal cellular damage from SARS-CoV-2. This is further supported by the recent detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a urine sample from an infected patient. 46 Findings of one of the first systematic investigations of kidney function in COVID-19 patients 48 are summarized in Table 7.Although the exact pathogenesis of kidney involvement in COVID-19 infection is unclear, it is reported that AKI in COVID-19 accompanies sepsis, multiorgan failure and shock, suggesting the cause of AKI to be acute tubular necrosis. 29 Alternatively, a study based on single-cell transcriptome analysis 47 proved ACE2 receptor expression in kidney cells, suggesting the plausibility of direct renal cellular damage from SARS-CoV-2.

        <p>In some patients, the metabolic consequences of AKI cannot be adequately controlled with conservative management; hence renal replacement therapy (RRT) can be required. There is little to no evidence that the starting time, 49 modality 50 and dose 51 of RRT has any difference in outcomes. However, convection therapies are known to cause filter clots and use consumables (eg, tubing and dialysate and/or replacement solution bags), which can increase costs and exacerbate the issues faced by an overwhelmed hospital. Continuous RRT (CRRT) has been successfully applied in the treatment of SARS, 52 MERS, 53 and sepsis. 46 A hemofiltration dose of 6 L/min removed proinflammatory cytokines and improved Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at day 7 in septic patients, 54 suggesting the effectiveness of CRRT in the management of renal manifestations in COVID-19.In some patients, the metabolic consequences of AKI cannot be adequately controlled with conservative management; hence renal replacement therapy (RRT) can be required.

        <p>A significant number of patients reported GI symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, with some reporting these symptoms as their sole presenting complaint. 32 The incidence of GI patients with and without AKI Estimated hazard ratio indicates that the mortality risk of COVID-19 patients with AKI is »5.3x (P&lt; 0.001) higher than the mortality risk of COVID-19 patients without AKI. AKI, acute kidney injury; BUN, blood urea nitrogen; KDIGO, Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes; SCr, serum creatinine. Conclusions: BUN and SCr are key predictors of AKI and they were found to be significantly higher in non-severe cases of COVID-19 compared to other commonly known pneumonia. Both high levels of BUN and SCr were commonly observed in severe and deceased cases across the course of COVID-19. Unlike BUN, for other pneumonia cases, there were no reported elevated SCr levels. Occurrence of kidney dysfunction in COVID-19 patients could be due to kidney-lung crosstalk 76 for the following reasons: renal cells have the potential to be target sites for SARS-CoV-2 and inflammatory responses following lung impairments could damage the kidney, where this kidney-lung crosstalk could lead to a "cytokine storm" that acutely induces multi-organ failure and death. Furthermore, direct renal cellular damage is consistent with another report 77 which found acute renal tubular damage in 6 COVID-19 cases from the histological analysis of renal cell autopsies.A significant number of patients reported GI symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, with some reporting these symptoms as their sole presenting complaint. 32 The incidence of GI patients with and without AKI Estimated hazard ratio indicates that the mortality risk of COVID-19 patients with AKI is »5.3x (P&lt; 0.001) higher than the mortality risk of COVID-19 patients without AKI.

        <p>Mild and transient liver injury, as well as severe liver damage can occur in COVID-19. Wong et al indicated that 14.8-53.1% of COVID-19 patients had abnormal levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and bilirubin during the course of the disease, with bilirubin showing the smallest elevation. Furthermore, they reported that severity of liver damage is proportional to that of COVID-19. 32 Gammaglutamyl transferase was elevated in 54% of patients in 1 cohort study that included 56 COVID-19 patients. 56Mild and transient liver injury, as well as severe liver damage can occur in COVID-19.

        <p>The surge in inflammatory parameters like IL-2, IL-7, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, interferon-g inducible protein 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-a, and tumor necrosis factor-a can be caused by an imbalanced immune response leading to cytokine storm or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. 57 Along with typical cardinal features like hyperferritinaemia, cytopenia, and unremitting fever; pulmonary and cardiac involvement including ARDS and acute coronary syndrome can also result from hypercytokinaemia. 57,58 Moreover, accumulating evidence suggests that this hyperinflammatory state can be predictors of morbidity and mortality in a significant subgroup of patients. 57 In a multicenter retrospective study, it was found that ferritin and IL-6 levels were more elevated in the non-survivor group as compared to the survivors. 59 This is also supported by findings of Qin et al who recently discovered that severe cases had higher neutrophillymphocyte ratio, lower percentages of basophils, eosinophils, and monocytes, as well as elevated inflammatory biomarkers and cytokines. Additionally, the number of suppressor and helper T cells, B cells, and NK cells were decreased in the severe group. 60 Septic shock is also reported in 4%-8% of patients in several case series. 61 Therefore, it is paramount for all patients with severe COVID-19 to be screened for hyperinflammation using ferritin levels, platelet count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate along with the HScore. 57,62 Once identified, therapeutic approach is to suppress the immune system. However, it is a difficult decision to determine whether antiinflammatory effects of treatment outweigh the risk of impairing the immune system that is trying to fight the infection. In addition to the options of steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins, IL-6 receptor antagonist monoclonal antibodies like tocilizumab and sarilumab, anakinra, Janus kinase inhibitor and CC chemokine receptor 5 antagonists are also in the clinical trial stage for treatment of cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19. 61The surge in inflammatory parameters like IL-2, IL-7, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, interferon-g inducible protein 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-a, and tumor necrosis factor-a can be caused by an imbalanced immune response leading to cytokine storm or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. 57 Along with typical cardinal features like hyperferritinaemia, cytopenia, and unremitting fever; pulmonary and cardiac involvement including ARDS and acute coronary syndrome can also result from hypercytokinaemia. 57,58 Moreover, accumulating evidence suggests that this hyperinflammatory state can be predictors of morbidity and mortality in a significant subgroup of patients. 57 In a multicenter retrospective study, it was found that ferritin and IL-6 levels were more elevated in the non-survivor group as compared to the survivors. 59 This is also supported by findings of Qin et al who recently discovered that severe cases had higher neutrophillymphocyte ratio, lower percentages of basophils, eosinophils, and monocytes, as well as elevated inflammatory biomarkers and cytokines.

        <p>The Nervous System It has been suggested that viral invasion of the central nervous system by SARS-CoV2 is possible by the synapse-connected route observed with other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and can lead to several neurological complications including ataxia, seizures, neuralgia, unconsciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease and encephalopathy. 61,63 Mao et al reported that 36.4% of their cohort had neurologic manifestations, the severe group being more likely to have acute cerebrovascular disease, impaired consciousness and skeletal muscle injury. 64 Furthermore, Li et al proposed that this potential viral invasion might play a partial role in the pathophysiology of acute respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. 63 The Coagulation Cascade Disseminated intravascular coagulation is another common complication of COVID-19 reported in 71.4% of nonsurvivors compared to only 0.6% of survivors. 65 It has also been found that use of anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin improved outcomes in severe cases with coagulopathy. 66The Nervous System It has been suggested that viral invasion of the central nervous system by SARS-CoV2 is possible by the synapse-connected route observed with other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and can lead to several neurological complications including ataxia, seizures, neuralgia, unconsciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease and encephalopathy. 61,63 Mao et al reported that 36.4% of their cohort had neurologic manifestations, the severe group being more likely to have acute cerebrovascular disease, impaired consciousness and skeletal muscle injury. 64 Furthermore, Li et al proposed that this potential viral invasion might play a partial role in the pathophysiology of acute respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. 63 The Coagulation Cascade Disseminated intravascular coagulation is another common complication of COVID-19 reported in 71.4% of nonsurvivors compared to only 0.6% of survivors. 65 It has also been found that use of anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin improved outcomes in severe cases with coagulopathy. 66</p>
        <p>One case of rhabdomyolysis as a potential late complication of COVID-19 has been reported in China. The possibility of under-diagnosis due to muscle pains being a common symptom of COVID-19 as well as creatine kinase and myoglobin levels not being routinely tested is also highlighted in the letter. 67One case of rhabdomyolysis as a potential late complication of COVID-19 has been reported in China.

        <p>Current interventions are supportive, as effective antiviral treatment has not yet been identified. The clinical management of adult patients are guided by international guidelines as well as local experience and regional outcomes. 68,69 Patients with signs of pneumonia and those of the high-risk group are indicated for hospitalization. Those with mild flu-like symptoms are discharged, supplemented with symptomatic treatment and advised to return in case of illness worsening.Current interventions are supportive, as effective antiviral treatment has not yet been identified.

        <p>Noninvasive oxygenation is generally not recommended in hypoxemic COVID-19 patients, particularly the use of high nasal flow oxygen. Noninvasive ventilation with continuous positive airway pressure, rather than bilevel positive airway pressure, is preferred. A target peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 92%-96% has been suggested. 70 Endotracheal intubation is indicated upon acute deterioration or failure of response towards standard oxygen therapy. Higher, instead of lower, positive end-expiratory pressure is recommended. For severe ARDS, prone ventilation for 16 hours/day is suggested. 71 Additional rescue interventions include extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation.Noninvasive oxygenation is generally not recommended in hypoxemic COVID-19 patients, particularly the use of high nasal flow oxygen.

        <p>Upon recognition of sepsis, standard care 72 is to be commenced as soon as possible. This includes initiation of fluid bolus and vasopressors for hypotension. Prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism is strongly recommended, LMWH preferred over unfractionated heparin, as well as nonpharmacological modalities such as intermittent pneumatic compression stockings. As mentioned above, AKI can be managed by CRRT. Intermittent RRT has been suggested to be as effective. 72 Cardiac support can be managed with direct input from the cardiology team and inotropic support if required.Upon recognition of sepsis, standard care 72 is to be commenced as soon as possible.

        <p>Multiorgan involvement has been apparent since the emergence of COVID-19-the rapidity of disease progression is widely influenced by the presence of comorbidities and of extrapulmonary organ injuries. ARDS, heart failure, renal failure, shock, and multiorgan failure precipitate death. Full attention to the comorbidities and potential organ injuries is therefore crucial in the implementation of preventative and protective measures. Acknowledging this could help in triaging the management of individual patients, minimizing the risk of decompensation. Alongside the rapid pace at which scientific results are shared, this paper hopes to add onto the ever-emerging landscape of medical knowledge on COVID-19.Multiorgan involvement has been apparent since the emergence of COVID-19-the rapidity of disease progression is widely influenced by the presence of comorbidities and of extrapulmonary organ injuries.
