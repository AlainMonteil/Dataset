Mental health and examining factors that may influence distress have been outlined as key research priorities in order to inform interventions. This research sought to examine whether intolerance of uncertainty and coping responses influence the degree of distress experienced by the UK general public during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
        <p>Methods: Utilising a cross-sectional online questionnaire design, participants were recruited (N= 842) using snowball sampling over a 10-day period in the early 'lockdown' phase of the pandemic. Findings: Around a quarter of participants demonstrated significantly elevated anxiety and depression, with 14.8% reaching clinical cut-off for health anxiety. A one-way MANOVA indicated those in 'vulnerable' groups were significantly more anxious (p&lt; .001), and also more anxious in relation to their health (p&lt; .001). Mediation modelling demonstrated maladaptive coping responses partially mediated the predictive relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and psychological distress. Conclusions: Mental health difficulties have become significantly raised during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, particularly for the vulnerable. Findings support emerging research suggesting the general public are struggling with uncertainty, more so than normal. Vulnerable groups are more anxious about their health, but not more intolerant of uncertainty than the non-vulnerable. Finally, this study indicated two modifiable factors that could act as treatment targets when adapting interventions for mental health during the COVID-19 global health crisis.Methods: Utilising a cross-sectional online questionnaire design, participants were recruited (N= 842) using snowball sampling over a 10-day period in the early 'lockdown' phase of the pandemic.

        <p>COVID-19 is an infectious disease that was first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Since then, the novel COVID-19 strain of coronavirus has spread worldwide, and was declared a 'public health emergency of international concern' in January 2020 (World Health Organisation, 2020a). The virus is contracted through an infected person coughing or sneezing, and will cause mild to moderate symptoms in most individuals infected. Symptoms include a fever, tiredness and a persistent dry cough (National Health Service, 2020a). However for some individuals, particularly those in vulnerable groups, symptoms can be more severe, and may result in hospitalization and/or death (World Health Organization, 2020a). There is currently no cure or vaccine for COVID-19.COVID-19 is an infectious disease that was first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019.

        <p>At the time of recruitment (17 th April 2020), there were 2.12 million cases globally of COVID-19, and 147,364 deaths recorded (World Health Organisation, 2020b).At the time of recruitment (17 th April 2020), there were 2.12 million cases globally of COVID-19, and 147,364 deaths recorded (World Health Organisation, 2020b).</p>

        <p>The socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 is uncertain, however it is likely to be profound and long lasting. Whilst it is not completely clear what effects the pandemic and lockdown will have on the mental health of the general population (Xiang et al., 2020), previous research exploring the psychological impact of previous pandemics (e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome; SARS) found that 35% of individuals recovering from SARS reported moderate to severe levels of depression and/or anxiety (Cheng et al., 2004), and during the H1N1 pandemic 30% of children and 25% of quarantined adults reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (Sprang &amp; Silman, 2013). A recently published rapid review summarizes these concerns, stating that quarantine can have a negative, potentially long-lasting impact on psychological health, and that this can be amplified by stressors both within and after quarantine (e.g. duration of quarantine, lack of information, financial loss; Brooks et al., 2020).The socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 is uncertain, however it is likely to be profound and long lasting.

        <p>Emerging reports suggest that due to the scale of the current pandemic, the impact is likely to be considerably larger, surpassing the effect of previous infectious disease outbreaks such as the SARS (Wilder-Smith et al., 2020). This gives some indication that for those who are unduly challenged by the uncertain time frame of restricted movement, reduced social contact for extended periods, and illness of self or close others, the psychological effects are likely to be very pronounced. This is supported by an initial survey of the UK population, which indicated that many individuals had widespread concerns about the impact the pandemic will have on their psychological health, more so than physical health concerns (Holmes et al., 2020).Emerging reports suggest that due to the scale of the current pandemic, the impact is likely to be considerably larger, surpassing the effect of previous infectious disease outbreaks such as the SARS (Wilder-Smith et al., 2020).

        <p>Numerous articles have been written emphasizing the importance of considering the psychological impact of pandemics on the general population (e.g. Sim &amp; Chua, 2004), and expert panels have stated that monitoring of mental health difficulties and examining psychological factors that may influence levels of distress are key research priorities during this time (Holmes et al., 2020). Recent data from China reflects 25% of the general population experienced some level of psychological distress during the first wave of COVID-19 (Qiu et al., 2020). This level of distress seems to remain stable throughout different phases of the pandemic, with Wang et al. (2020) noting no significant difference between rates of stress, anxiety and depression during the initial phase of COVID-19 in comparison to the peak in China four weeks later. Therefore any increased psychological distress within the UK population could be long-standing, and is likely to have much wider socioeconomic impacts than anticipated (e.g. increased demand on mental health services). In addition, there has been limited research published exploring directly modifiable factors that influence distress, and it is therefore imperative to determine what factors exist that can be targeted in the treatment of any arising mental health difficulties.Numerous articles have been written emphasizing the importance of considering the psychological impact of pandemics on the general population (e.g. Sim &amp; Chua, 2004), and expert panels have stated that monitoring of mental health difficulties and examining psychological factors that may influence levels of distress are key research priorities during this time (Holmes et al., 2020).

        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a high degree of uncertainty worldwide; international responses have varied, rates of infection have been heterogeneous, but all agree that this pandemic is unprecedented. It is likely that some individuals will find this uncertainty difficult to tolerate. 'Intolerance of uncertainty' (IU) is a psychological concept most notably examined as a key maintaining factor within generalized anxiety disorder. However, with more recent research suggesting IU is a concept found across many emotional disorders (e.g. Carleton et al., 2012;Carleton et al., 2014;Fergus &amp; Bardeen, 2013;Holaway et al., 2006), transdiagnostic models of IU have been established (Einstein, 2014;Freeston et al., 2020).The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a high degree of uncertainty worldwide; international responses have varied, rates of infection have been heterogeneous, but all agree that this pandemic is unprecedented.

        <p>IU refers to an individual's negative emotions, cognitions and behaviours (e.g. coping behaviours) when experiencing uncertainty (Birrell et al., 2011); this could include day-to-day things such as wondering if the bus will arrive on time, to awaiting the outcome of an interview, the uncertain nature of an early stage relationship or presently, the not knowing when the threat of COVID-19 will remit.IU refers to an individual's negative emotions, cognitions and behaviours (e.g. coping behaviours) when experiencing uncertainty (Birrell et al., 2011); this could include day-to-day things such as wondering if the bus will arrive on time, to awaiting the outcome of an interview, the uncertain nature of an early stage relationship or presently, the not knowing when the threat of COVID-19 will remit.</p>
        <p>Models of IU suggest that an individual's ability to tolerate uncertainty will likely influence the way they respond and cope with a situation (Einstein et al., 2014). Coping strategies are an individual's efforts to manage their distress, although they are not always effective at doing so. Particular coping strategies (e.g. acceptance, seeking support) are associated with greater psychological health than other, more maladaptive strategies (e.g. self-blame, denial; Hagan et al., 2017;Meyer, 2001). Research exploring IU and coping within the H1N1 pandemic in Canada found that greater IU predicted higher levels of H1N1-specific anxiety in participants (Taha et al., 2014) but this relationship was mediated by the coping strategies used, with individuals with high IU being more likely to use emotion-focused coping (e.g. self-blame and rumination). Due to the proposed transdiagnostic nature of IU, further research is needed to explore whether IU and coping responses play a role in a range of mental health difficulties during a pandemic. In addition, there was no enforced lockdown in Canada for the general population during the H1N1 pandemic so generalizability is limited, and it is unclear what the psychological impact of the current, more restrictive containment measures for COVID-19 will be.Models of IU suggest that an individual's ability to tolerate uncertainty will likely influence the way they respond and cope with a situation (Einstein et al., 2014).

        <p>The proliferation of COVID-19 may also present a special case for individuals with underlying health conditions. In the UK, the government outlined groups that are likely to be more vulnerable to experiencing the severe symptoms of COVID-19; this included individuals with chronic respiratory diseases, those on immunosuppressive medication and those above the age of 70 (National Health Service, 2020b). Of all the COVID-19 deaths that occurred in England and Wales during March and April 2020, 90.4% of individuals had a pre-existing health condition (Office for National Statistics, 2020). Previous research into IU in health conditions is sparse, however it could be argued that for these individuals, the increased uncertainty and more pronounced health threat will be particularly difficult to manage.The proliferation of COVID-19 may also present a special case for individuals with underlying health conditions.

        <p>Difference in IU, generalized anxiety, depression, and health anxiety scores between vulnerable groups and the general population were assessed using a one-way MANOVA. Levene's Test highlighted that the assumption of homogeneity of variances had been violated (p &lt; .05), so all four dependent variables were transformed using a square root transformation. The normal Q-Q plots indicated that following transformation the variables were approximately normally distributed. Pearson's correlations identified no multicollinearity between dependent variables (r &lt; .90; see Table 4), and scatterplots highlighted that there was a linear relationship between the dependent variables in both vulnerable and non-vulnerable groups. Mahalanobis distance identified multivariate outliers, but these were not removed as removing these outliers did not change the profile of results.

        <p>Formatted: Not Highlight Finally, multiple parallel mediation modeling using the PROCESS macro for 
            <rs type="software">SPSS</rs> (Hayes, 2017) explored whether IU predicted mental health variables (i.e. anxiety, depression and health anxiety scores), and whether adaptive and maladaptive coping responses mediated this relationship. Based on information from previous literature (e.g. WHO World Mental Health Survey Consortium, 2007;McLean et al., 2011;Scott et al., 2007) and following preliminary analysis of study demographic data, gender, age, previous mental health condition and vulnerable group status were all inputted as covariates to isolate the effects of IU and coping responses. Indirect effects were tested using non-parametric bootstrapping with 5,000 samples. When 95% confidence intervals did not include zero, the indirect effect was considered significant (Hayes, 2017).

        <p>Those who identified with the UK government defined "vulnerable group" were significantly more likely to reach threshold for health anxiety or generalized anxiety than those who did not. This is consistent with previous research reporting high prevalence of health anxiety in medical and hospital samples (Alberts et al., 2011;Daniels et al., 2020), with highest reported rates of a similar 24.7% (Tyrer et al., 2011), where the normal range is 4-6% (Bleichhardt &amp; Hiller, 2007;Sunderland et al., 2013). It is likely that during a time of increased threat such as an infectious disease pandemic, individuals with physical health conditions are likely to be vigilant, checking for symptoms and signs of COVID-19, avoiding contamination, and taking other strategic and automatic behaviours which inadvertently perpetuate or precipitate health anxiety (Salkovskis et al., 2003). Thus elevated rates of health anxiety are unsurprising, particularly given the higher rates of mortality in those with underlying conditions (Office for National Statistics, 2020). Indeed, health anxiety may be seen as adaptive in this context, with anxiety previously being associated with higher compliance in safety precautions during pandemics (Rubin et al., 2009). Many of these individuals will continue to 'shield' for longer during current and future pandemic waves (Public Health England, 2020), therefore it is essential that their mental health needs are addressed in an accessible, evidence-based way (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy; Hofmann et al., 2012).Those who identified with the UK government defined "vulnerable group" were significantly more likely to reach threshold for health anxiety or generalized anxiety than those who did not.

        <p>In a recent paper published in the Lancet, Holmes et al. (2020) outlined that psychological support for COVID-19 should be 'mechanistically informed'. Current findings indicated that IU predicted the three mental health difficulties studied within this paper, and maladaptive coping responses partially mediated this relationship. This extends on Taha et al.'s (2014) research that found emotion-focused coping mediated the relationship between IU and H1N1-specific anxiety, as current findings highlight the transdiagnostic importance of these variables (Einstein, 2014). This finding is of clinical importance, as IU and maladaptive coping responses are modifiable factors that could be targeted when adapting psychological interventions for COVID-19. Individuals in vulnerable groups were not significantly different in their ability to tolerate uncertainty than the rest of the general population, which may be attributed to an adapted tolerance of uncertainty when living with a long-term health condition (Kurita et al., 2013). Freeston et al.'s (2020) model of uncertainty distress suggests that alongside intolerance of uncertainty, 'perceived threat' (i.e. degree to which one feels under threat) independently contributes to psychological distress. Thus it could be that for physically vulnerable individuals, it is the perceived (and arguably realistic) increase in threat, rather than their overall ability to tolerate uncertainty, that contributes to their increased levels of psychological distress. This should be examined further. (Salkosvkis et al., 2003) may be benefit from adaptation to incorporate IU and patterns of coping as discussed herewith. For example, from both our results and proposed models of IU (Freeston et al., 2020) it could be theorized that individuals who are struggling with their mental health may find uncertainty difficult to manage, and may be more likely to be using maladaptive coping strategies such as self-distraction as a result. Maladaptive strategies such as these can perpetuate distress by preventing disconfirmation of the feared outcome (Salkovskis et al., 2003). Thus, public health strategies should focus on providing resources to encourage and equip the public in the use of adaptive coping strategies such as acceptance, and appropriate levels of support seeking (Daniels, 2020), to increase tolerance of uncertainty during this time.In a recent paper published in the Lancet, Holmes et al.

        <p>However, it is worth noting that adaptive strategies were not a significant mediator. As reflected in the post-hoc analysis, this is perhaps due to an underuse of some adaptive strategies (e.g. acceptance) and increased use of particular 'help-seeking' strategies (e.g. seeking emotional and instrumental support) in individuals who find it difficult to tolerate uncertainty. The potential overuse of 'help-seeking' type strategies may be reflective of safety-seeking behaviours commonly seen in health anxiety and GAD such as reassurance seeking, however the degree of safety-seeking and whether this constitutes 'excessive', for example, is purely speculative. In these cases, commonly considered adaptive strategies have the potential to become maladaptive (i.e. maintain Formatted: Not Highlight Formatted: Not Highlight the difficulties; Salkovskis et al., 2003), therefore this should be kept in mind when considering how to appropriately promote their use.However, it is worth noting that adaptive strategies were not a significant mediator.

        <p>Regarding the potential benefit of increasing tolerance of uncertainty in the general public, previous transdiagnostic treatments of IU have already been established (e.g. Robichaud &amp; Dugas, 2006) and form part of recommended UK guidelines (NICE, 2011). Concepts from these treatments could be adapted to provide psychological support and guidance in a more structured and targeted way to those who are struggling the most with uncertainty. It is likely that while face-to-face contact is limited, online resources will be particularly useful and have been found to be as efficacious as traditional interventions (Carlbring et al., 2018). Development of online resources now will help prepare for future infection waves and pandemics.Regarding the potential benefit of increasing tolerance of uncertainty in the general public, previous transdiagnostic treatments of IU have already been established (e.g. Robichaud &amp; Dugas, 2006) and form part of recommended UK guidelines (NICE, 2011).

        <p>At 20%, males were under-represented within the current study. Previous research suggests over-representation of females is common in mental health online surveys (Batterham, 2014), and that females have greater levels of mental health difficulties than males (19% compared to 12%;McManus et al., 2016). However, the rates of existing mental health difficulties were found to be typical of the general population, and rates of current mental health difficulties found within this study were still significantly above those rates found in females alone.At 20%, males were under-represented within the current study.

        <p>The scope of this project was restricted to the public, and future research could seek to determine whether other groups that may be less able to tolerate uncertainty and more vulnerable to psychological distress. For example, Kang et al. (2020) suggested that rates of distress may be even higher in 'key worker' populations.The scope of this project was restricted to the public, and future research could seek to determine whether other groups that may be less able to tolerate uncertainty and more vulnerable to psychological distress.

        <p>However this data is currently emerging (Roberts et al. 2020). In addition, the current study considered whether people in vulnerable groups were more likely to experience psychological distress, but did not ask whether individuals had close friends or family that were vulnerable when families are expected to 'shield' together. It raises the question of indirect impact.However this data is currently emerging (Roberts et al. 2020).

        <p>Finally, this study is cross-sectional in nature and therefore the mediation analyses offer an impression of directionality that could be explored further in future experimental research.Finally, this study is cross-sectional in nature and therefore the mediation analyses offer an impression of directionality that could be explored further in future experimental research.</p>
        <p>Longitudinal research replicating current findings would firmly establish the psychological impact of COVID-19 and how intolerance of uncertainty and distress will change over the course of the current and future waves of the pandemic.Longitudinal research replicating current findings would firmly establish the psychological impact of COVID-19 and how intolerance of uncertainty and distress will change over the course of the current and future waves of the pandemic.</p>
        <p>This study is the first to examine health anxiety and coping responses in the general population during COVID-19, adding to the emerging literature on psychological distress and intolerance of uncertainty during unprecedentedly uncertain times. Overall, this study reflects increased mental health difficulties during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, highlighting the importance of targeting modifiable variables to enable the public to manage their psychological health during this time, equipping them for potential future pandemic waves.This study is the first to examine health anxiety and coping responses in the general population during COVID-19, adding to the emerging literature on psychological distress and intolerance of uncertainty during unprecedentedly uncertain times.
