        <p>• Interpreting the result of a test for covid-19 depends on two things: the accuracy of the test, and the pre-test probability or estimated risk of disease before testing • A positive RT-PCR test for covid-19 test has more weight than a negative test because of the test's high specificity but moderate sensitivity • A single negative covid-19 test should not be used as a rule-out in patients with strongly suggestive symptoms • Clinicians should share information with patients about the accuracy of covid-19 tests Across the world there is a clamour for covid-19 testing, with Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization, encouraging countries to "test, test, test." 1 The availability of the complete genome of covid-19 early in the epidemic facilitated development of tests to detect viral RNA. 2 Multiple assays with different gene targets have been developed using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). 3 These viral RNA tests use samples usually obtained from the respiratory tract by nasopharyngeal swab, to detect current infections. Serology blood tests to detect antibodies indicating past infection are being developed; these will not be considered in depth in this article.• Interpreting the result of a test for covid-19 depends on two things: the accuracy of the test, and the pre-test probability or estimated risk of disease before testing • A positive RT-PCR test for covid-19 test has more weight than a negative test because of the test's high specificity but moderate sensitivity • A single negative covid-19 test should not be used as a rule-out in patients with strongly suggestive symptoms • Clinicians should share information with patients about the accuracy of covid-19 tests Across the world there is a clamour for covid-19 testing, with Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization, encouraging countries to "test, test, test." 1 The availability of the complete genome of covid-19 early in the epidemic facilitated development of tests to detect viral RNA. 2 Multiple assays with different gene targets have been developed using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). 3 These viral RNA tests use samples usually obtained from the respiratory tract by nasopharyngeal swab, to detect current infections.

        <p>No test gives a 100% accurate result; tests need to be evaluated to determine their sensitivity and specificity, ideally by comparison with a "gold standard." The lack of such a clear-cut "gold-standard" for covid-19 testing makes evaluation of test accuracy challenging.No test gives a 100% accurate result; tests need to be evaluated to determine their sensitivity and specificity, ideally by comparison with a "gold standard."

        <p>A systematic review of the accuracy of covid-19 tests reported false negative rates of between 2% and 29% (equating to sensitivity of 71-98%), based on negative RT-PCR tests which were positive on repeat testing. 6 The use of repeat RT-PCR testing as gold standard is likely to underestimate the true rate of false negatives, as not all patients in the included studies received repeat testing and those with clinically diagnosed covid-19 were not considered as actually having covid-19. 6 Accuracy of viral RNA swabs in clinical practice varies depending on the site and quality of sampling. In one study, sensitivity of RT-PCR in 205 patients varied, at 93% for broncho-alveolar lavage, 72% for sputum, 63% for nasal swabs, and only 32% for throat swabs. 7 Accuracy is also likely to vary depending on stage of disease 8 and degree of viral multiplication or clearance. 9 Higher sensitivities are reported depending on which gene targets are used, and whether multiple gene tests are used in combination. 3 10 Reported accuracies are much higher for in vitro studies, which measure performance of primers using coronavirus cell culture in carefully controlled conditions. 2 The lack of a clear-cut "gold-standard" is a challenge for evaluating covid-19 tests; pragmatically, clinical adjudication may be the best available "gold standard," based on repeat swabs, history, and contact with patients known to have covid-19, chest radiographs, and computed tomography scans. Inevitably this introduces some incorporation bias, where the test being evaluated forms part of the reference standard, and this would tend to inflate the measured sensitivity of these tests. 11 Disease prevalence can also affect estimates of accuracy: tests developed and evaluated in populations with high prevalence (eg, secondary care) may have lower sensitivity when applied in a lower prevalence setting (eg, primary care). 11 Correspondence to J Watson Jessica.Watson@bristol.ac.uk Further evidence and independent validation of covid-19 tests are needed. 13 As current studies show marked variation and are likely to overestimate sensitivity, we will use the lower end of current estimates from systematic reviews, 6 with the approximate numbers of 70% for sensitivity and 95% for specificity for illustrative purposes.A systematic review of the accuracy of covid-19 tests reported false negative rates of between 2% and 29% (equating to sensitivity of 71-98%), based on negative RT-PCR tests which were positive on repeat testing. 6 The use of repeat RT-PCR testing as gold standard is likely to underestimate the true rate of false negatives, as not all patients in the included studies received repeat testing and those with clinically diagnosed covid-19 were not considered as actually having covid-19. 6 Accuracy of viral RNA swabs in clinical practice varies depending on the site and quality of sampling.

        <p>Sensitivity and specificity can be confusing terms that may be misunderstood 14 Pre-test probability is high in someone with typical symptoms of covid-19, an occupational risk of exposure, and working in a high prevalence region, and negative test results can therefore be misleading. Table 1 shows that for a pre-test probability of 90%, someone with a negative test has a 74% chance of having covid-19; with two negative tests this risk is still around 47%. If this doctor were to return to work and subsequently the test was confirmed as a false negative, then the decision to work would potentially have significant consequences for his patients, colleagues, and everyone with whom he came into contact. It is therefore safest for this GP with strongly suggestive symptoms to self-isolate in line with guidelines for covid-19, even though his test results are negative. This case illustrates the fallacy of base-rate neglect; it can be tempting to trust the results of an "objective" test more than one's own "subjective" clinical judgement. In general, during this pandemic, pre-test probabilities of covid-19 will be high, particularly in high prevalence secondary care settings.

        <p>(see supplementary file 'Definitions and formulae for calculating measures of test accuracy'). Sensitivity is the proportion of patients with disease who have a positive test, or the true positive rate. Specificity is the proportion of patients without disease who have a negative test, or true negative rate. These terms describe the operating characteristics of a test and can be used to gauge the credibility of a test result. They can be combined to calculate likelihood ratios, which are dimensionless numbers that indicate the strength of a positive or negative test result.(see supplementary file 'Definitions and formulae for calculating measures of test accuracy').

        <p>For calculating probabilities, a likelihood ratio can be used as a multiplier to convert pre-test odds to post-test odds. Positive likelihood ratios greater than 1 are progressively stronger, with 10 representing a very strong positive test result. Negative likelihood ratios less than 1 are also progressively stronger, with 0.1 representing a very strong negative test result. In the case of the nasopharyngeal swab RNA test for covid-19, the positive likelihood ratio is about 14, which is excellent.For calculating probabilities, a likelihood ratio can be used as a multiplier to convert pre-test odds to post-test odds.

        <p>While positive tests for covid-19 are clinically useful, negative tests need to be interpreted with caution, taking into account the pre-test probability of disease. This has important implications for clinicians interpreting tests and policymakers designing diagnostic algorithms for covid-19.
