        <p>MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prevalence of infection and antibiotic exposure (cross-sectional design) and all-cause in-hospital mortality (longitudinal design). RESULTS Among 15 202 included patients (mean age, 61.1 years [SD, 17.3 years]; 9181 were men [60.4%]), infection data were available for 15 165 (99.8%); 8135 (54%) had suspected or proven infection, including 1760 (22%) with ICU-acquired infection. A total of 10 640 patients (70%) received at least 1 antibiotic. The proportion of patients with suspected or proven infection ranged from 43% (141/328) in Australasia to 60% (1892/3150) in Asia and the Middle East. Among the 8135 patients with suspected or proven infection, 5259 (65%) had at least 1 positive microbiological culture; gram-negative microorganisms were identified in 67% of these patients (n = 3540), gram-positive microorganisms in 37% (n = 1946), and fungal microorganisms in 16% (n = 864). The in-hospital mortality rate was 30% (2404/7936) in patients with suspected or proven infection. In a multilevel analysis, ICU-acquired infection was independently associated with higher risk of mortality compared with community-acquired infection (odds ratio [OR], 1.32 [95% CI, 1.10-1.60]; P = .003). Among antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, infection with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (OR, 2.41 [95% CI, 1.43-4.06]; P = .001), Klebsiella resistant to β-lactam antibiotics, including third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems (OR, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.02-1.63]; P = .03), or carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter species (OR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.08-1.81]; P = .01) was independently associated with a higher risk of death vs infection with another microorganism.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prevalence of infection and antibiotic exposure (cross-sectional design) and all-cause in-hospital mortality (longitudinal design).

        <p>nfection is a common occurrence among patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) and a prerequisite to the development of sepsis. 1 Since 2009, several studies have provided national and international epidemiological data on sepsis, [2][3][4][5][6] but fewer studies have specifically concentrated on the underlying infections. Detailed data from around the world on types of infection, including causative microorganisms, as well as on the use and availability of diagnostic and treatment options are important because they can help increase and maintain awareness among clinicians, patients, and caregivers about the effects of infections; identify risk factors for infection; aid in the development of focused policies for diagnosis and treatment; facilitate adequate and appropriate resource allocation; assist in the design of interventional studies; and provide a baseline against which changes in patient characteristics and the effects of new treatments or management programs can be assessed over time.nfection is a common occurrence among patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) and a prerequisite to the development of sepsis. 1 Since 2009, several studies have provided national and international epidemiological data on sepsis, [2][3][4][5][6] but fewer studies have specifically concentrated on the underlying infections.

        <p>In 1992, the European Prevalence of Infection in Intensive Care (EPIC I) study was conducted in western European ICUs. 7 On the study day, 45% of patients had suspected or proven infection and 62% were receiving antibiotics (prophylactic or therapeutic). In 2007, a study of similar design but extending inclusion to ICUs worldwide (Extended Prevalence of Infection in Intensive Care [EPIC II]) was conducted. 8 On the study day, 51% of the patients had suspected or proven infection and 71% were receiving prophylactic antibiotics, therapeutic antibiotics, or both types of antibiotics.In 1992, the European Prevalence of Infection in Intensive Care (EPIC I) study was conducted in western European ICUs. 7 On the study day, 45% of patients had suspected or proven infection and 62% were receiving antibiotics (prophylactic or therapeutic).

        <p>This was an observational, cross-sectional, 24-hour point prevalence study that used a similar study design to that used in the previous EPIC studies. 7,8 An international steering committee was established with representatives from 5 continents who were selected for their acknowledged expertise in the field of intensive care infections (eAppendix 1 in the Supplement). With support from the World Federation of Societies of Intensive and Critical Care Medicine, emails were sent to members of national intensive care societies, to contacts of the steering committee members, and to more than 35 000 contacts held in the database of the International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine, informing them of the upcoming study. The initiative was also announced during various international meetings and shared on social media.

        <p>The study definitions were provided in the case report form and appear in the Supplement. Closed ICUs were defined as those in which only ICU physicians could write orders. Volume in the ICU was defined as the number of admissions during the year prior to inclusion in the study (ie, 2016). If an infection was considered present, investigators were asked to indicate whether it was definite, probable, or possible per definitions from the International Sepsis Forum, 9 and its mode of acquisition (in the community, at the hospital or health careassociated, or in the ICU). Antibiotics received on the study day (prophylactic and therapeutic) were recorded.The study definitions were provided in the case report form and appear in the Supplement.

        <p>To estimate associations of patient characteristics, ICU organizational factors, and gross national income per capita with infection and in-hospital death, we used a 3-level technique with the structure of a patient (level 1) admitted to a hospital (level 2) within a country (level 3). Thus, patients were nested within hospitals within countries. The random-effects model included hospital and country units to express the concept that patients from the same country and treated at the same hospital share a common environment.To estimate associations of patient characteristics, ICU organizational factors, and gross national income per capita with infection and in-hospital death, we used a 3-level technique with the structure of a patient (level 1) admitted to a hospital (level 2) within a country (level 3).

        <p>In this 24-hour point prevalence study conducted at 1150 participating centers in 88 countries on September 13, 2017, the overall rate of suspected or proven infection was 54%, which was higher than in previous EPIC studies (45% for EPIC I [measured in 1992] 7 and 51% for EPIC II [measured in 2007] 8 ). The effect of increased detection rates due to changes in protocols and improved technology cannot be ruled out, although the proportion of patients with positive microbiological cultures was lower than in the EPIC II study (65% vs 70%). The proportion of patients with ICU-acquired infection was similar to the 21% reported in the EPIC I study. 7 The present data indicate that the proportions of patients in the ICU with infection continued to vary considerably across geographic regions. Although most of the participating centers were in Europe, the rest of the world was well represented with large numbers of centers in China and South America; however, countries with low to lower-middle gross national income per capita contributed just 6% of the centers and less than 5% of the patients. The variation in prevalence of infection was associated with patient-specific and diseasespecific factors and with process of care factors across centers. Such factors may include different ICU admission criteria, lower availability of resources to adjudicate or exclude a diagnosis of infection, low nurse-to-patient ratios, and differences in infection control and antimicrobial stewardship policies. The independent effects of each of these factors could not be determined from this study, but process of care differences across centers and their relationship to the prevalence of infection should be considered when planning and interpreting the results of clinical trials.In this 24-hour point prevalence study conducted at 1150 participating centers in 88 countries on September 13, 2017, the overall rate of suspected or proven infection was 54%, which was higher than in previous EPIC studies (45% for EPIC I [measured in 1992] 7 and 51% for EPIC II [measured in 2007] 8 ).

        <p>Gram-negative microorganisms were identified more frequently than gram-positive microorganisms on culture. No specific microorganism was independently and significantly associated with a higher risk of death when considering all patients with an infection. Older age, higher SAPS II, and comorbid metastatic cancer, HIV infection, and heart failure were independently associated with a higher risk of death. This variation was associated with patient-specific and diseasespecific factors and with process of care and country-tocountry differences. In an extended analysis of data from the EPIC II study, the importance of hospital and ICU organizational factors on outcomes was also demonstrated. 13 In terms of country-to-country variation, differences in health care (both primary care and hospital-based) expenditure, access to ICU facilities, and bed availability may play a role. Other country-related factors may include local variations in living conditions, nutritional status, vaccine availability, antibiotic availability and consumption, and poor sanitation. 14 It is not possible to determine the relevant importance of each of these aspects from the present data but these are important considerations when assessing the global burden of infection.Gram-negative microorganisms were identified more frequently than gram-positive microorganisms on culture.

        <p>When considering only antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, infections with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, Klebsiella resistant to β-lactam antibiotics (including third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems), and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter species were independently associated with an increased risk of death, highlighting the association of antibiotic resistance with mortality and the importance of good antibiotic stewardship. Carbapenemresistant Acinetobacter baumannii and carbapenem-resistant or third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae have been listed as critical pathogens on the World Health Organization priority list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria for effective drug development, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus as high priority. 15 These infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality and contribute to prolonged hospital stays and high hospital costs.

        <p>The study has several limitations. First, participation was entirely voluntary, with no financial incentive, so that monitoring of data input and accuracy could only be performed centrally. Voluntary participation may also lead to participation bias. Second, due to the study design, it was not possible to establish the time of infection onset and no information on infection resolution, appropriateness of treatment selection, or effectiveness of antibiotic choices was collected. Moreover, because this was a 24-hour point prevalence study conducted during autumn in the northern hemisphere and during spring in the southern hemisphere, it is possible that seasonal factors may account for some of the geographical differences. Differences in climate within and between countries may also potentially influence the types of causative microorganisms. 20 Point prevalence studies are also biased by patient length of stay, potentially resulting in an oversampling of patients with longer ICU lengths of stay and influencing assessments of risk for mortality.The study has several limitations.

        <p>Third, even though a large number of centers participated, the representation of each country may be heterogeneous in terms of the proportions of ICUs that participated, resulting in a patchwork picture rather than complete global coverage, and there may be important differences in availability and quality of health care within some of the geographical regions, limiting interpretation of some of the results. In addition, because of the small numbers of centers in some re-gions, particularly regions with low to lower-middle gross national income per capita, differences in infection rates by region and the true association with mortality are difficult to evaluate because of the multiple local variations in living conditions, access to medical care, local infrastructure, and facilities, including for microbiological cultures.Third, even though a large number of centers participated, the representation of each country may be heterogeneous in terms of the proportions of ICUs that participated, resulting in a patchwork picture rather than complete global coverage, and there may be important differences in availability and quality of health care within some of the geographical regions, limiting interpretation of some of the results.

        <p>Fifth, despite improved communication capabilities, which helped to spread the news of the study, and more widespread access to the internet, which enabled easy and secure data input, many centers were unable to participate.
