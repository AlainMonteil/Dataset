        <p>Background: Post-acute COVID-19 Syndrome is now recognized as a complex systemic disease that is associated with substantial morbidity.</p>
        <p>Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of persistent symptoms and signs at least 12 weeks after acute COVID-19 at different follow-up periods.</p>
        <p>A significant number of patients who have recovered from acute COVID-19 infection are reporting lasting symptoms resulting in impairment of everyday activities beyond the initial acute period. These post COVID-19 patients suffer from a phenomenon known as "long" or "chronic" COVID-19 or more recently, Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 or Post-Acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) (1,2).</p>
        <p>The terms "long COVID-19" and "post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS)" lack a unified definition. The definition endorsed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the World Health Organization (WHO) as a set of "signs and symptoms that emerge during or after an infection consistent with COVID-19, persist for more than 12 weeks, and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis" (3,4).</p>
        <p>Many experts including the NICE panel also agree to subdivide into two categories: 1-post-COVID-19 subacute phase of ongoing symptoms that last 4-12 weeks after the onset of illness, and 2-chronic phase or long COVID-19, defined as symptoms and abnormalities that last more than 12 weeks after the onset of illness and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis (2,4). This timeframe distinction is important because it differentiates between the acute illness and the sequelae of possibly an irreversible tissue damage with varying degrees of dysfunction and symptoms potentially involving several possible conditions as suggested by some experts: post-intensive care syndrome, post-thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications, acute-phase immune-mediated complications, and/or multi-systemic inflammatory syndrome in children or adults (5). Globally, the number of patients recovering from COVID-19 infection continues to grow at an unprecedented rate.</p>
        <p>Therefore, we sought to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of available literature to estimate the prevalence of persistent symptoms and signs after at least 12 weeks of acute COVID-19 at different follow-up (FU) periods.</p>
        <p>This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline for study design, search protocol, screening, and reporting (6,7).</p>
        <p>The literature was searched by a medical librarian for the concepts of long-term symptoms in patients infected by Covid-19. Search strategies were created using a combination of keywords and standardized index terms. Searches were originally run in November 2020 and updated in January and September 2021 in Ovid Embase, Ovid Medline (including publication ahead of print, in-process &amp; other nonindexed citations) and PubMed.gov which includes preprints. Results were limited to English language and primarily adult studies. All citations were exported to 
            <rs type="software">EndNote</rs> where 4,539 duplicates were removed leaving 3,921 citations. Search strategies are provided in the supplementary material (Supplement 1).
        </p>
        <p>Articles were considered eligible for inclusion if they (1) were written in the English language; (2) were peer-reviewed cohort, case-control or cross-sectional studies that reported the prevalence of persistent symptoms among individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection; (3) included at least 50 patients (4) had followup of at least 3 months after symptoms onset (as per the NICE definition), (5) all patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 and (6) follow-up reported as mean, median or set-interval following symptoms onset, diagnosis, acute illness or initial CT chest imaging. Where studies had overlapping investigated populations, studies with larger sample sizes were prioritized with the remainder excluded (8).</p>
        <p>We subsequently identified a subgroup of these eligible studies that included studies with a comparator group consisting of non-COVID cases.</p>
        <p>Six reviewers (O.O., M.S.A., M.O., N.A.F., R.A., B.A.S.) examined the titles and abstracts of articles in pairs, using the above pre-defined selection criteria. This was followed by a full text review of each article to confirm meeting the eligibility criteria. Disagreements regarding inclusion of a full-text article were discussed and agreed with the senior reviewer (IT).</p>
        <p>Data were extracted simultaneously by six reviewers in duplicates (OO, NAF, BAS, RA, MSA, MO) into a pre-specified data collection form, with any discrepancies resolved in consultation with the senior reviewer (IMT). Data were collected across the following domains: study characteristics, follow-up method, baseline demographics and symptom prevalence. Full details of the data collation variables can be found in the supplementary material (Supplement 2).</p>
        <p>The reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias for each study using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool for prevalence studies. JBI critical appraisal checklist for studies reporting prevalence consists of nine questions: (1) Sample frame suitability,(2) Sampling method appropriateness (3) Sample size adequacy,(4) Proper description of study subjects and setting, (5) Sufficient coverage of the identified sample (6) Usage of valid methods for identification of the condition, (7) Standard and reliable way of measurement of the condition for all participants, (8) Appropriate statistical analysis and (9) Adequate response rate (9). Each study was assessed across each of these questions and determined as either 'Yes', 'No' or 'Unclear'. Studies were assigned an overall score, reflecting the number of questions with a 'Yes' response.</p>
        <p>Studies with a comparator group consisting of non-COVID cases were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) (10).The NOS rates observational studies based on 3 parameters: selection, comparability between exposed and unexposed groups, and exposure and outcome assessment. These 3 domains can have a maximum score of 4, 2, and 3 stars, respectively. Studies with &lt;5 stars are considered low quality, 5-7 stars moderate quality, and &gt;7 stars high quality.</p>
        <p>Our outcome of interest was prevalence of symptoms at follow-up across four different follow up intervals: 3-&lt;6 months, 6-&lt;9 months, 9-&lt;12 months and ≥12 months. Due to varying definitions of "day 0" to follow up across the literature, we accepted definitions of "day 0" that include COVID-19 symptom onset, COVID-19 diagnosis or hospital discharge after acute illness. We further categorized studies according to the severity of COVID-19, which was defined in this context as patients' setting during acute illness: ranging from outpatient (OP), general inpatient wards (IP) or intensive care unit (ICU) settings. Where symptoms prevalence at follow-up was not reported separately based on COVID-19 severity, studies were described as "mixed", for example "mixed IP/ICU".</p>
        <p>The range of persistent COVID-19 symptoms reported to date was then identified and categorized.</p>
        <p>Given the exchangeable terminology to refer to symptoms across studies, the following terms were grouped: "sleep disturbance" to refer to insomnia, daytime sleepiness, sleep difficulties, and/or sleep disorders, "concentration difficulties" to refer to confusion, change in level of consciousness and/or concentration, "cognitive impairment" to refer to cognitive dysfunction, brain fog, and/or cognition difficulties, "loss of taste" to refer to taste dysfunction, alteration of taste, dysgeusia, and parageusia, "loss of smell" to refer to smell dysfunction, alteration of smell, anosmia, hyposmia, smell blindness, and olfactory disorders. Signs and symptoms were divided into 7 main systems: mental health, respiratory system, cardiovascular system, musculoskeletal system, nervous system, gastrointestinal system and other.</p>
        <p>The total cohort number and the number of patients with different symptoms or complaints were extracted from each study at different follow up times into 4 intervals: 3-&lt;6 months, 6-&lt;9 months, 9-&lt;12 months and ≥12 months. We performed separate meta-analyses for the aforementioned follow up intervals where ≥3 studies reported symptom prevalence at that follow up interval. The arcsine transformation was used to obtain a pooled estimate of the prevalence of each symptom. As conventional meta-analysis models assume normally distributed data, the arcsine-based transformations are applied to the proportion data to yield better approximations to the normal distribution and they have the important advantage of stabilizing variances (11,12). We used DerSimonian and Laird random effect model with inverse variance method to pool prevalence (13). We performed subgroup meta-analyses by severity of acute COVID-19 in the included studies, thereby allowing a visual display of heterogeneity due the differences in the severity of illness in reporting studies. We evaluated between-studies heterogeneity using the I 2 statistic, which estimates the variability percentage in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than to chance (14). Twotailed p&lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>
        <p>We performed meta-regression to explore between studies heterogeneity. We considered several a priori chosen study level variables based on clinical plausibility (Supplement 3). Meta-regression was performed for each symptom where ≥10 studies reported prevalence at any given follow-up interval as per the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews (15).The regression coefficients obtained from the meta-regression analyses describe how the outcome variable (the pooled prevalence) changes with a unit increase in the continuous explanatory variable and changes for the category of interest compared to a reference category for a categorical variable. The statistical significance was considered as p&lt;0.01for the results of the meta-regression and we reported if a variable was found to be a significant contributor to heterogeneity. All statistical analyses were performed using 
            <rs type="software">Stata</rs>
        </p>
        <p>Of the 3209 abstracts screened, 152 full-text articles were reviewed with 63 included in the final analysis (Figure 1) . After full article review, the most common reason for exclusion was the absence of reported data on symptom prevalence at stated follow-up (n=36), followed by the inclusion of COVID-19</p>
        <p>Meta-analysis highlighted the substantial heterogeneity between symptom prevalence's reported across studies, with I 2 statistics ranging from 75.4% (difficulty concentrating at 3-&lt;6 months follow up) to 99.4% (fatigue at 9-&lt;12 months follow up), with the vast majority of symptoms across all follow up intervals producing an I 2 ≥ 90%. The most commonly reported symptoms between 3-&lt;6 months are fatigue (32%, 95% CI = 22-44%, number of studies = 25, sample size = 7268) followed by dyspnea (25%, 95% CI = 17-34%, number of studies = 28, sample size = 8132), sleep disorder (24%, 95% CI = 8-44%, number of studies = 8, sample size = 4369) and concentration difficulty (22%, 95% CI = 15-31%, number of studies = 5, sample size, = 466). Between 6-&lt;9 months, the most common symptoms reported were effort intolerance (45%, 95% CI -25-67%, number of studies = 5, sample size = 850), fatigue (36%, 95% CI = 27-46%, number of studies = 19, sample size 8191), sleep disorder (29%, 95% CI 15-45%, number of studies = 12, sample size = 242000), and dyspnea (25%, 95% CI = 20-30%, number of studies = 13, 4384). In the 9-&lt;12 months period, the meta-analysis included 9 symptoms with the highest prevalence reported for fatigue (37%, 95% CI = 16-62%, number of studies = 5, sample size = 3758) and dyspnea (21%, 95% CI = 14-28%, number of studies = 5, sample size = 3758), with loss of taste being the least reported (6%, 95% CI 1-13%, number of studies = 3, sample size = 1742). Similarly, fatigue was the most reported symptom (41%, 95% CI 30-53%, number of studies = 4, sample size = 1246) in the &gt;12 months period. It is noteworthy that fatigue, dyspnea, myalgia, and sleep disorder were most reported in the &gt;12 months interval; while cough, headache, loss of taste and loss of smell were most common at 6-&lt;9 months (Figure 2, Panels A-B, Supplement 6, Panels C-D).</p>
        <p>Due to a limited number of studies reporting symptom prevalence at 9-&lt;12 months or ≥12 months, meta-regression was performed for symptom prevalence at 3-&lt;6 months and 6-&lt;9 months (Supplement 6). Observed statistically significant effect modifiers included: world region where the study was conducted, percentage of study participants who were men, and those who had DM, disease severity category as defined earlier and the overall study quality score.</p>
        <p>Studies reporting results from Asian populations reported a lower prevalence of fatigue, dyspnea, loss of smell and loss of taste at 3-6 month follow up and a lower prevalence of fatigue at 6-9 month follow up.</p>
        <p>A higher proportion of men was found to be associated with a lower prevalence of cough and loss of smell at 6-9 months follow up, whilst a higher proportion of diabetes mellitus as a comorbidity was associated with a lower prevalence of loss of smell and taste at 3-6 and 6-9 month follow up. Studies investigating patients in ICU were associated with a higher prevalence of dyspnea compared to studies investigating an OP population at 3-6 month and 6-9 month follow up intervals. Higher study quality was found to be associated with lower prevalence of dyspnea at 3-6 months and cough at 6-9 months follow up.</p>
        <p>A total of 6 studies reporting symptoms prevalence included a comparator group consisting of COVID-19 negative cases, with a summary of their findings presented in Table 2 (17,24,26,37,59,62). Of these, 2 studies compared long term symptom prevalence of COVID-19 cases to either influenza, pneumonia or other respiratory tract infection cases (17,26). Overall, all but one study reported higher prevalence of symptoms or adverse event in cases following COVID-19 compared to respective comparator groups, with one negative study specifically assessing olfactory and gustatory dysfunction at 6 months (37). Two out of 6 studies were rigorously designed. One study observed that COVID-19 cases had significantly higher hazard of mood disorder, anxiety and insomnia when compared to matched cohorts with influenza or respiratory tract infection (26). Another study observed that COVID-19 cases have significantly higher prevalence of symptoms at 6 and 9 months follow-up when compared to community controls, including fatigue, sleep difficulties, hair loss, smell disorder, taste disorder, palpitations, chest pain and headaches (45).</p>
        <p>The studies were generally assessed to have good quality with a mean average critical appraisal score across all studies of 7.97/9. The question that affected the scores the most was "Was the sample size adequate?", with few studies demonstrating appropriate sample size calculations nor representing a significantly large enough sample to provide high external validity (Table S1).</p>
        <p>Study quality was assessed via the NOS as moderate to high, ranging from 5 to 9 (maximum 9), with a number of studies using an non-representative sample of healthcare workers (37,59), or having comparability concerns by not adequately matching cases with the comparator group (17,37,59,62) (Table S2).</p>
        <p>In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 63 studies with a total of 257,348 COVID-19 patients from different world regions, we observed that patients report several clinically significant symptoms across many organs systems 3 months post-acute COVID-19. In addition, we observed that the high betweenstudies heterogeneity of reported symptoms prevalence could at least be partially explained by clinically plausible effect modifiers such as acute COVID-19 severity, and certain patients' demographics and comorbidities (26,45,80,81).</p>
        <p>Our findings lend more support to the initiatives of several countries and organizations that have started to fund more research and disseminate guidelines to better understand, diagnose and treat PACS (8,82,83).</p>
        <p>It remains unknown what proportion of these lingering symptoms are true sequalae of COVID-19 vs. the effects of underlying chronic diseases or pandemic effects on individuals and societies (84,85). Although most studies did not have a control group, the association of certain symptoms with COVID-19 infection among the 6 studies that had appropriate comparator groups supports our findings of a significant burden of PACS. Recent rigorously conducted comparative studies that examined the risk of new clinical sequalae rather than persistent symptoms at 6-month follow-up have shown a higher risk of long-term complications and incident diagnoses after acute COVID-19 infection, among non-hospitalized cases when compared to a matched non-COVID cohort, and hospitalized COVID-19 cases when compared to matched hospitalized influenza cases or when compared to other non-COVID viral lower respiratory tract illnesses. An increasing risk gradient of new sequalae was observed with increasing COVID-19 severity (86,87).</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the mechanisms that explain these chronic symptoms after COVID- 19 are not yet fully understood. In addition to the direct effects of SARS-CoV-2, the immune response to the virus is believed to be partly responsible for the appearance of these lasting symptoms, possibly through facilitating an ongoing hyperinflammatory process (88). Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the long-term outcomes of COVID-19 infection: a) Sequalae of COVID-19 organ involvement during acute infection, b) COVID-19 patients with chronic symptoms may harbor the virus in several potential tissue reservoirs across the body, which may not be identified by nasopharyngeal swabs, c) cross reactivity of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies with host proteins resulting in autoimmunity, d) delayed viral clearance due to immune exhaustion resulting in chronic inflammation and impaired tissue repair, e) mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired immunometabolism, and f) alterations in microbiome leading to long-term health consequences of COVID-19 (88)(89)(90)(91).</p>
        <p>Our systematic review provides a rigorous and unique update of previous attempts by other investigators. First, a number of previous reviews either did not assess the included studies for risk of bias or utilized an inappropriate assessment tool, such as the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for noncomparative studies. We observed that the quality of included studies to be a significant contributor to heterogeneity of reported symptoms prevalence, with lower quality studies reporting higher prevalence of certain symptoms (92,93). Second, other systematic reviews have included studies with short followup periods between one and three months after acute illness and hence do not provide an indication of persistent and chronic symptoms that are defined beyond 12 weeks as per NICE (92)(93)(94)(95). Third, although previous studies have performed meta-analysis, with Michelen et al. performing meta-regression for variables of ICU admission and proportion female and Iqbal et al. performing thorough sub-group analysis, no previous systematic review has separated symptoms prevalence across different follow-up intervals or considered other important effect-modifiers for meta-regression (96,97). Finally, and importantly, we present the first attempt to identify and assess studies including an appropriate non-COVID group to provide additional evidence of the association between COVID-19 and the high prevalence of symptoms at follow-up.</p>
        <p>Although our review included the most recent eligible studies with the largest sample size, there is a degree of consistency between the findings of symptoms prevalence between our meta-analyses and others. We report a prevalence of fatigue of 32%, 36%, 47% and 41% across follow up periods from 3 to 6 months, 6 to 9 months, 9 to 12 months and greater than 12 months respectively, which is comparable to the findings of Michelen et al. (30.1%) and Iqbal et al. (37%). This similarity is also the case for dyspnea, with previous meta-analysis reporting estimates of prevalence between 25 and 35%, as well as myalgia and hair loss.</p>
        <p>Our study is the largest and most comprehensive systematic review of persistent symptoms after acute COVID-19 to date. However, it has a number of limitations inherent to the included studies and studies design. As noted by previous systematic reviews on this topic, studies included in our review lacked uniform symptom terminology, standardized recording methods, and grouping of multiple symptoms under umbrella terms. This limited our ability to compare prevalence and frequency of these symptoms across the studies. Severity of illness was not described in numerous studies, with results presented for whole cohorts and not presented as sub-groups. Thus, grouping all symptoms of various disease severity yield inaccurate estimates of symptoms frequencies. The high observed statistical heterogeneity as measured by I 2 limit the interpretation of the pooled frequencies, although our extensive metaregression illuminates significant contributors to this heterogeneity; namely severity as defined by highest level of medical care, geographic location, prevalence of diabetes and method of assessing symptom at follow-up (98).</p>
        <p>We agree with Nasserie et al. in their recommendations about areas of improvement in future research of PACS whether in the conduct of studies or reporting of the various characteristics of symptoms for such conditions including the use of a standardized definition for symptoms and time-zero and including an objective measure of symptom severity and duration. There is a need for further rigorously conducted cohort studies in order to quantify the relative risk of developing long term symptoms following acute COVID-19 infections in comparison to non-COVID-19 comparator group, including healthy controls and those with other acute respiratory infections (94,97,99). Although there are baseline differences in between groups in terms of co-morbidities, COVID-19 cases had significantly lower selfreported "health change" compared to controls.</p>
        <p>No funding was received for this work.</p>
        <p>In this large systematic review, we observed, with high degree between-study heterogeneity, that a large proportion of COVID-19 patients have persisting and varying symptoms for several months after the acute infection. While there remain many unanswered questions about PACS, our study brings more evidence from a large number of patients and across different worldwide populations about the prevalence of the long-term effects of COVID-19. Our data support the recent global efforts to conduct additional research to address its underlying mechanisms, epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of PACS.</p>
