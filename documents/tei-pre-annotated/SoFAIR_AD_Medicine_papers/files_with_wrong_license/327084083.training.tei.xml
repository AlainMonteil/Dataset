        <p>The functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), or disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBIs), are gastrointestinal (GI) disorders related to any combination of motility disturbance, visceral hypersensitivity, altered mucosal and immune function, altered gut microbiota, and altered central nervous system (CNS) processing. 1 They result in significant global healthcare costs [2][3][4] and impaired health-related quality of life (QOL). 5 However, population-based cross-sectional surveys have not satisfactorily delineated their actual prevalence. Published studies have involved highly variable diagnostic criteria, study populations, questionnaires, and data collection methods. [6][7][8] For irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia (FD), the two most researched disorders, reported prevalence estimates are very broad (1.1-45.0% for IBS, 9 and 1.8-57.0% for FD). 10,11 Thus, given the large methodological heterogeneity, it is inappropriate to pool individual prevalence rates, and we are left with an unanswered question as to whether the differences in prevalence rates seen among individual countries in prior surveys reflect genuine differences between populations or are due to methodological differences between studies.</p>
        <p>The ideal global epidemiological study would use uniform methodology to assess nationally representative populations of sufficient size throughout the world, but this is not feasible. The present study, conducted in 33 countries at the same time, did use standardized methodology (although circumstances mandated two different data collection methods), with identical diagnostic questions to approximate to that ideal, assessed the global prevalence and burden of FGIDs, including sub-analyses by country, sex, and age groups. The results are summarized for all FGIDs, but the main focus is on five prevalent disorders because they are the most researched of the FGIDs and the most salient for clinicians: IBS, FD, functional constipation (FC), functional diarrhea, and functional bloating/distention.</p>
        <p>The overall aims of this global study were to conduct an extensive multinational epidemiological study of all the FGIDs that are assessible by self-report, to obtain reliable and precise regional and local estimates of FGID prevalence, and to collect data on numerous potentially associated factors that might explain differences in FGIDs among populations and generate hypotheses to advance understanding of their pathophysiology.</p>
        <p>Secondary aims included the development of a database that could serve as a source of data mining and be integrated with other similar databases in the future, and to establish a network of FGID experts with a track record of research collaboration on a global scale.</p>
        <p>The present paper focuses on classic epidemiological findings: prevalence rates by country and geographical region, by age and sex, and preliminary indicators of burden of disease. As a descriptive study, there are no a priori hypotheses, so no hypothesis testing was conducted.</p>
        <p>The study was conducted in 33 countries (Fig. A minimum of 2,000 individuals were surveyed in each country, in both the Internet and household surveys. In India and China, the minimum number of individuals in the surveys was increased to allow for the size of the national populations. In Japan the sample size was raised to 2,500 because the sex ratio among the first 2,000 participants was higher among men in some age groups. We recruited an additional 500 participants, primarily women, to achieve a more balanced sex ratio. Thus, the final study population was larger than originally anticipated at 70,000 (33 countries with 2,000 individuals each, plus double surveys in China and Turkey). The pre-defined demographic parameters for all countries were 50% females and 50% males, and 40% for 18-39 years, 40% for 40-64 years, and 20% for 65+ years.</p>
        <p>In countries where most adults use the Internet, a secured online survey (accessible only to pre-selected invited participants) was conducted using population samples provided by a professional company (Qualtrics, LLC., Provo, Utah, USA) who awarded participant points redeemable for gifts. These surveys were anonymous, nationwide, and had built-in qualityassurance measures to exclude poor-quality responders, including two attention-check questions, a completion-speed check, and repeat questions to detect inconsistent responders.</p>
        <p>The software ensured that there were no missing answers to compulsory questions, and had automated skip patterns, resulting in complete and accurate symptom pattern information.</p>
        <p>In countries in which an Internet survey was unfeasible, usually because of poor Internet coverage, personal interviews were conducted in probability samples of individuals (one per household) in selected villages and cities, without national representation. The household survey countries were Bangladesh, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, and Nigeria. In the case of Iran, the Internet infrastructure was sufficient for an Internet survey, but Qualtrics, Rome IV FGID diagnoses. Subjects with a history of peptic ulcer disease were excluded from esophageal, gastroduodenal and biliary diagnoses. Finally, subjects who reported diverticulitis or bowel resection were excluded from bowel and anorectal disorders. Since no independent medical evaluation was done, this exclusion method may have eliminated individuals who did not have a functional GI disorder.</p>
        <p>For household countries, where a proportion of cases had missing responses to diagnostic questions on the 22 FGIDs, these cases were excluded from prevalence analysis for all the FGIDs (N=4,087) leaving a final total of 18,949. This was necessary because several Rome FGID diagnoses overlap and the determination of whether a person warrants a particular diagnosis may depend on whether criteria for one or more other FGIDs are met.</p>
        <p>The survey also included an 80-item supplemental questionnaire on sociodemographic characteristics, medical and health history, co-morbid symptoms and conditions, GI infections, healthcare utilization, medications, childhood and current living conditions, psychosocial variables, diet, QOL, and culture and religion (Supplemental Table 1). It incorporated validated questionnaires such as the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15), 13 IBS symptom severity scale (IBS-SSS), 14 , and the Personal Health Questionnaire-4</p>
        <p>(PHQ-4) 15 on anxiety and depression.</p>
        <p>The Rome III IBS diagnostic questions 16 were included in all nine household survey countries and in 14 of the 26 Internet countries (Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Egypt, France, Germany, Holland, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Singapore, and Turkey) to compare IBS prevalence between Rome III and Rome IV criteria. The reason we did this for IBS and not for all FGIDs was that its criteria underwent the most substantial change between Rome III and IV and the length of the study questionnaires reached a limit that could not be expanded. Including all the Rome III questions for the other FGIDs would have increased the study questionnaire by about 50%.</p>
        <p>We used two proxy variables to assess the burden of FGIDs: (1) healthcare utilization; i.e., history of (a) physician consultation about bowel problems and (b) frequency of doctor visits per year for any health problems, and (2) quality of life scores on the PROMIS Global-10 questionnaire (range 4-20). 17 As part of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement</p>
        <p>Information System (PROMIS), this questionnaire is a publicly available global health assessment tool that measures symptoms, functioning, and healthcare-related quality of life (HRQoL) for a wide variety of chronic diseases and conditions.</p>
        <p>The study questionnaire underwent translatability assessment by a professional company (TransPerfect, Inc. USA), 18, and was then translated by the same company into 21 languages with linguistic validation (cognitive debriefing). Each country PI monitored this process to ensure that the translated questionnaires were linguistically valid and culturally adapted for their country. Where appropriate, the translations were "localized," e.g., the original English questionnaire was translated into Spanish for Mexico and then localized for Colombia, Argentina, and Spain.</p>
        <p>In a descriptive study, when estimating prevalence rates, sample size considerations are guided by the desired precision in the 95% confidence intervals. When estimating unknown prevalence rates, the most conservative approach (i.e., the one that provides the largest variance and thus the widest confidence intervals), assumes a prevalence of 0.50. In this study, we chose the minimum sample size of 2,000 participants per country to obtain high precision of within-country estimates of prevalence rates. Thus, 95% confidence intervals (CI) for prevalence rates as high as 0.50 would range within ± 0.022; and less common diagnoses (smaller prevalence rates) would have higher precision (narrower CIs).</p>
        <p>We calculated country-specific prevalence rates for all major FGID diagnoses by sex and age groups. Prevalence rates were pooled across countries using Yang's meta-prevalence method, 19 which combines separate population survey prevalence estimates into an overall meta-prevalence estimate. Because of substantial differences in data collection methodology between the Internet and household methods, global pooling was done within survey type only.</p>
        <p>Ethical review was completed for all countries. The study was approved or exempted from ethics board oversight (the latter for Internet survey countries, where subjects were anonymous to the investigators). All survey participants completed a written consent form, either electronically (Internet surveys) or on paper (household surveys).</p>
        <p>The survey was completed by 73,076 respondents; 36,148 women (49.47%) and 36,928 men (50.53%). The numbers of women by survey group were 26,576 respondents (49.1%) in the Internet countries and 18,949 (50.5%) in the household countries. We successfully achieved equal sex distribution and pre-planned age ranges in most countries with both surveying methods.</p>
        <p>We do not have full data on response rates. In the Internet surveys, panels of registered country-specific survey-takers were contacted through email until all quota categories were filled. There is no way to know how many saw those e-mails or how many were reached, so response rates are not available.</p>
        <p>We have full response rates for Bangladesh, Malaysia, both surveyed regions in India, and The prevalence results are presented below in accordance with GI tract anatomical regions, corresponding to the order of the questions in the Rome IV Diagnostic Questionnaire. The results for all the FGIDs appear in Table 1. These results will be discussed in a more comprehensive and overlapping context in the Discussion section below.</p>
        <p>The prevalence rates of five selected major FGIDs compared across all the countries surveyed are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 3, to provide a more detailed view of the variance of these disorders globally.</p>
        <p>The most prevalent esophageal disorder in Internet and household surveys was functional dysphagia, with pooled prevalence rates of 3.2% (3.0, 3.3) and 1.2% (1.0, 1.3), respectively.</p>
        <p>The rates for functional heartburn, reflux hypersensitivity, and esophageal chest pain were substantially lower. All esophageal disorders were more prevalent among women in both survey methods. However, there was a divergence in results in terms of age, with decreasing rates in the older age groups in the Internet countries but increasing rates with age in the household countries.</p>
        <p>FD was the most prevalent gastroduodenal disorder, with a pooled prevalence rate of 7.2%</p>
        <p>The most prevalent bowel disorder in both survey types was FC, with pooled rates of 11.7% (11.4, 12.0) and 6.6% (6.3, 6.9) for Internet and household surveys, respectively.</p>
        <p>Other prevalent disorders were functional diarrhea at 4.7% (4.5, 4.9) and 1.2% (1.0, 1. 2 and Fig. 3). However, most of the countries (19 of 26) had IBS rates between 3% to 5%. The outliers besides Singapore and Egypt were Japan (2.2%) China (2.3%), Russia (5.9%), South Africa (5.9%), and the USA (5.3%). Twenty four of the 26 countries had prevalence rates between 2% to 6%, with Singapore and Egypt as outliers. In the household countries, IBS prevalence ranged from 0.2% (0.1, 0.3) in India to 4.6% (3.7, 5.5) in Bangladesh, and the variance was greater than in the Internet countries (Table 2 and Fig. 3). The pooled prevalence rates for IBS were substantially higher among women in both survey methods, with a female-to-male odds ratio of 1. household participants having at least one of those six disorders.</p>
        <p>There were almost no cases of either of these diagnostic entities. The rate for centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome was 0.02% (N=9) for the Internet survey and 0.05% (N=9) for the household survey. The corresponding rates for biliary pain were 0.08% (N=44) and 0.03% (N=5), respectively.</p>
        <p>In the Internet surveys, 8.1% (7.9, 8.3) of subjects met criteria for at least one anorectal disorder, compared to 2.7% (2.5, 2.9) in the household surveys. In both cases, the most prevalent disorder was proctalgia fugax at 5.9% (5.7, 6.1) in the Internet surveys and 1.7%</p>
        <p>(1.5, 1.9) in the household surveys.</p>
        <p>In the 14 Internet countries where Rome III questions were included, the overall IBS prevalence was 3.8% (3.6, 4.0) by Rome IV criteria and 10.1% (9.8, 10.5) by Rome III criteria. Rome IV IBS rates were substantially lower than Rome III in all countries, ranging from 24% to 57% of Rome III IBS prevalence rates. In the nine household countries, the pooled IBS prevalence rates were 1.5% (1.3, 1.7) using Rome IV and 3.5% (3.3, 3.8) using</p>
        <p>Rome III, with Rome IV prevalence rates ranging from 18% to 75% of Rome III IBS prevalence rates. In this group of countries, the prevalence increased for both criteria with increasing age.</p>
        <p>In contrast to the household surveys, by both criteria, IBS rates were lower on average in older individuals in the Internet surveys. Women had substantially higher IBS rates than men in all age groups by both criteria: Rome III OR=1.72 ( prevalence rates by Rome IV were lower than in most studies using previous versions of the Rome criteria 9 and generally half or less of Rome III prevalence rates in the same countries. This is in line with a recently published study in the US, Canada and the UK, that used a similar study methodology, 21 (d) Rome IV IBS rates were similar among most of the Internet countries, with 19 of the 26 having prevalence rates between 3-5%. Singapore and Egypt were clear outliers at 1.3% and 7.6%, respectively. In the household countries, the prevalence was more variable, ranging from 0.2% in India to 4.6% in Bangladesh. As has been reported previously, we found women to have higher rates of IBS than men. We also found the sexes to have a different IBS subtype pattern: among women the rate of IBS-C is higher than IBS-D, while among men this is reversed, (e) in the Internet countries FGID prevalence decreased with age, but there was an opposite trend seen in the household countries, (f) FGID prevalence rates for the household countries were consistently lower than the Internet countries. This also holds true for Turkey, even though their household survey methodology was much more similar to Internet surveys than in other household survey countries. Notably, the pattern of relative prevalence among the various disorders was consistent among the various FGIDs among all countries, and (g) a few disorders, such as functional dysphagia, rumination, and proctalgia fugax, have prevalence rates that are higher than might be expected in light of clinical experience. It is possible that as we deepen our analyses of the entire database, some patterns may evolve that we are unaware of at the present.</p>
        <p>Our findings on the cumulative presence of FGIDs (meeting diagnostic criteria for at least one FGID) are congruent with a previous study of the U.S. population with the original Rome criteria (when there were 20 FGIDs) published in 1993, 22 which found 69% of U.S. adults to have any FGID. The high prevalence in both cases is simply the result of evaluating simultaneously the presence of many disorders in the same population samples, yielding a comprehensive picture of the vast scope of FGIDs as a societal health problem.</p>
        <p>Among the Internet-surveyed countries, the prevalence rates for many of the FGIDs, and IBS in particular, were quite similar and the variance was low. This illustrates that IBS and the other FGIDs are truly world-wide disorders. It also shows that the Rome IV diagnostic questionnaire can identify these disorders across geographical regions and in numerous translations. Yet, as has been reported previoiusly, 8,10,23 there is variance among the countries in the prevalence of these disorders. There are several potential explanations for this variability, including cultural differences, social reporting sensitivity, ethnic diversity, genetics, and dietary habits. We are confident that the differences found in this study are not due to differences in study methodology, which was uniform within Internet and household surveys. Thus, in light of the rigorous and uniform research methodology we applied, we believe that the observed prevalence rates do reflect accurately differences among countries and are variable enough to warrant further investigation into reasons for differences between countries and regions, 24,25 and their association with potential predictive factors covered in our supplemental questionnaire. Such analyses can provide insights into more subtle aspects of the FGIDs and generate hypotheses for future research but are beyond the scope of the present paper.</p>
        <p>One of the more notable findings of our study is that IBS was less than half as prevalent using Rome IV compared to Rome III. This comparison was included in the study to assess whether worldwide regional prevalence differed according to the criteria used. 26 The current Rome IV criteria are more stringent, requiring at least weekly abdominal pain (discomfort was not included), whereas Rome III required abdominal pain or discomfort at least 2-3 times monthly. 27,28 We believe that this change in criteria resulted, as previously reported, [29][30][31][32] in a shift in prevalence from IBS-C to FC and from IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D) to functional diarrhea, since the increased pain frequency threshold required for IBS was not reached or the subjects suffered from discomfort rather than pain. This is consistent with the approach of viewing individual patients with constipation on a pain frequency spectrum 33 where differences in pain occurrence determine shifts from IBS to FC or functional diarrhea.</p>
        <p>The Rome IV IBS criteria, being more restrictive than Rome III, lead to more similar diagnostic groups for clinical research and drug trials. Consequently, the Rome IV criteria are identifying more severe cases of IBS, as also reflected in the IBS-SSS scores, rather than the totality of the condition as seen by clinicians. However, clinicians may not use such stringent criteria in practice, as treatment is likely to be the same even for "sub-threshold" patients with slightly less frequent abdominal pain. Clinicians tend to rely more on symptom presentation and clusters. Thus, the relative prevalence "shift" away from IBS may have more implications for recruitment into research studies, especially clinical trials, where the Rome IV criteria define a more severe or specific population than those seen in clinical practice. Since FC and functional diarrhea and their corresponding IBS subtypes often respond to the same therapies, 34 the shift in diagnosis may have less impact on treatment.</p>
        <p>Unspecified functional bowel disorder was the most prevalent bowel diagnosis in our study. As it is the default diagnosis for people who have significant bowel symptoms but fail to qualify for another bowel disorder, the diagnostic criteria for functional bowel disorders, especially IBS, may be too restrictive. In contrast, the least prevalent subtype of IBS (Table 1) was IBS-U, so the addition of the Bristol Stool Form Scale as a discriminator for IBS subtypes may have facilitated the classification of the three specific subtypes (IBS-C, IBS-D and IBS-M), reducing the number of non-specific cases. Diagnostic criteria for cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, central abdominal pain syndrome, and functional biliary pain, where hardly any cases were identified, may also be restrictive. These disorders may be particularly difficult to identify in studies based on questionnaires. Previous studies have shown somewhat higher prevalence rates, especially for chronic abdominal pain syndrome, the more studied of these relatively rare disorders. 22,35 Although the prevalence rates for many of the individual FGIDs were low, a large proportion of individuals met diagnostic criteria for at least one FGID. Combined with the findings that individuals meeting FGID criteria were twice as likely to consult doctors for bowel problems and had significantly lower general QOL than othera, the collective burden of these disorders is substantial. The results of our study confirm that FGIDs are more prevalent among women than men. This is consistent with previous reports over the years. 36 Also consistent with previous reports, we found in the Internet surveys that FGIDs decreased with age. 9 However, in the household surveys, prevalence rates tended to rise with increasing age, as discussed further below.</p>
        <p>A key strength of this study that has implications for future research was the effectiveness of Internet surveys. Not only is this now becoming the default option in most countries since telephone and mail surveys are not feasible ways to reach the general population, but it provided reliable, quality-controlled data with a nationally representative distribution. This could not be accomplished with household surveys.</p>
        <p>The most important limitations of our study relate to the lack of national representation and missing data in the household surveys (excepting Turkey). Furthermore, the necessity of relying on two different survey methodologies precluded calculation of pooled global prevalence rates for all 33 countries together.</p>
        <p>The anonymous Internet survey methodology constitutes a very different survey experience for subjects than the face-to-face household survey methodology, and cultural sensitivities around reporting of FGID symptoms may have led to the large differences in prevalence rates observed between the two survey methods. Our assessment is that the Internet surveys provided more reliable estimates of prevalence rates because a) we achieved national representation, b) we achieved more complete, accurate and reliable data collection since no question that required an answer could be skipped, and questions that should have been skipped, based on responses to key trigger questions, were always skipped and could not be answered. In addition, quality control measures including maximum speed of questionnaire completion, repeat questions for response consistency assessment, and attention-check questions were included. Finally, data were automatically and accurately entered into the study database, eliminating manual entry errors. Another strength of the study was the uniform translation methodology with linguistic validation and cultural adaptation, which also generated a repository of translated study questionnaires for future global research in FGIDs.</p>
        <p>The pattern of relative prevalence among the various FGIDs was consistent in spite of the substantial differences in the absolute prevalence rates between the Internet and household surveys. While the reasons for the lower mean FGID prevalence in the household surveys compared to the Internet surveys are unclear, there are several possible explanations. It could be a consequence of reluctance to report sensitive or intimate digestive tract symptoms in face-to-face interviews. This could be more salient in younger respondents, consistent with the unique finding in household countries that rates increased with age. Moreover, since we included only one subject per household and FGIDs often cluster in families, this method might have under-estimated the prevalence. Another factor contributing to the prevalence difference was that a much higher percentage of household than Internet survey participants (48.7 vs. 9.7%) lived in rural communities: We found that FGIDs were reported somewhat more frequently in urban than rural areas with an OR=1.14 (1.08, 1.21) for Internet countries and OR=1.17 (1.09, 1.26) for household surveys, although the magnitude of difference was inconsistent across all FGIDs. Because the prevalence rates were particularly low in India and Turkey (household), we rechecked the data entry process and the diagnostic scoring syntax, but no mistakes were found to explain this. The two geographically and linguistically separate sites surveyed in India had similarly low prevalence rates. To date, we have no definitive explanation for these unusually low rates, especially in light of the very different results from Bangladesh, a country with much in common with India.</p>
        <p>Another limitation of the study is the lack of response rates for the Internet surveys and limited response rate information for the household surveys. However, in those countries for which we have precise data, Bangladesh, Malaysia, both regions in India, and Iran, the response rates were all over 90%. Since similar participation encouragement methods were used in all household countries, we feel confident that the response rates were high in the others as well, although we don't have the exact figures.</p>
        <p>An additional limitation of our study is that since it was a non-clinical questionnaire study of the general population, participants were not evaluated with procedures such as endoscopy or manometry, so some of the participants could have had an "organic" cause of their digestive symptoms. However, we believe that our inclusion of a checklist of organic diagnoses that might account for GI symptoms, and our exclusion of such cases from FGID prevalence counts (7.6% in Internet countries and 4.0% in household countries), compensated at least partially for this. A further limitation was that we attained less than satisfactory coverage of Africa and the Middle East. Our attempts to rectify this proved futile due to difficulties in recruiting interested investigators in the relevant countries.</p>
        <p>The data collected with the supplemental questionnaire used in this study may yield findings on a range of variables with possible associations with FGIDs. Future analyses using those data will enable us to look at the relevance of differences in factors such as diet, hygiene, economic status, level of education, previous GI infections, and psychological comorbidity, in regard to FGID prevalence. These are likely to generate observations and hypotheses for further work that eventually may produce new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of FGIDs.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, this paper represents the first report documenting the global prevalence of</p>
        <p>FGIDs assessed with a uniform diagnostic questionnaire and research methodology. The results may influence substantially future planning of health care resources and clinical trials.</p>
        <p>Funding for research in the FGIDs is universally low, and they are viewed as a non-priority.</p>
        <p>The data highlight a strong need and rationale for this to change. They should be of interest to multiple medical disciplines in addition to gastroenterologists, including general practitioners, family physicians, internists, nurses, dieticians, epidemiologists, public health experts, as well as other allied health care providers. We expect that the results presented here, and those to be reported from our future analyses, will serve as essential reference data for years to come.</p>

Also, individuals who met Rome IV criteria for any FGID were more likely to have visited doctors at any time in the past because of bowel problems than those with no FGID: 47.1% vs. 26.5% in the Internet, and 26.4% vs. 11.9% in the household survey. The same applied for each of the five selected major FGIDs.</p>
        <p>Health-related QOL was lower on the PROMIS Global-10 questionnaire for individuals with any FGID compared to subjects with no FGID for global mental and global physical scores, in both Internet and household surveys. Most participants reported QOL scores in the middle of the possible range of scores, with little variability. men. The corresponding figure for the household surveys was 24%. Our data show that the female predominance of FGIDs is present for FGIDs in all regions of the GI tract, from the esophagus to the rectum, and with both Internet and household survey methodologies, (c) IBS</p>

What you need to know: Background and Context: Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs, or disorders of gut-brain interaction) place an economic burden on healthcare systems and reduce quality of life, but little is known about their worldwide prevalence or distribution.</p>
        <p>New Findings: In a large-scale multi-national study, the authors found that more than 40% of persons worldwide have FGIDs. Similar trends and relative distributions were found in people who completed internet vs personal interviews.</p>
        <p>Limitations: Study participants completed questionnaires over the internet or by in-person interviews; further studies of the worldwide prevalence of FGIDs, where possible with confirmation, are indicated.</p>
        <p>Impact: FGIDs are common in all regions of the world. Proportions of persons with irritable bowel syndrome are lower when the Rome IV criteria are used, compared with the Rome III criteria.</p>
        <p>Lay Summary: Functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome, are common worldwide, have negative effects on quality of life, and are a substantial economic burden; further research and new treatment strategies are needed.</p>
