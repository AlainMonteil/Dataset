        <p>This update and revision of the international guideline for urticaria is based on evidence and expert consensus and was developed following the methods recommended by Cochrane and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group. A structured consensus process was used to discuss and agree upon recommendations. The conference was held in a hybrid format on 3 December 2020, in Berlin, Germany and online.</p>
        <p>The guideline is a joint initiative of the Dermatology Section of the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (EAACI), the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network (GA²LEN) and its Urticaria and Angioedema Centers of Reference and Excellence (UCAREs and ACAREs), the European Dermatology Forum (EDF), and the Asia Pacific Association of Allergy, Asthma, and Clinical Immunology (APAAACI). All of these organizations provided funding for the development of the guideline, which is an update and revision of the EAACI/GA²LEN/EDF/WAO guideline on urticaria published in 2018. [1][2][3][4] There was no funding from other sources.</p>
        <p>The present update and revision of the guideline was undertaken by a panel of 64 urticaria experts from 31 countries, nominated as delegates by 50 participating national and/or international medical or scientific societies (Table 1). All of the societies involved endorse the guideline. The work of the expert panel was supported by a team of EuroGuiDerm methodologists led by Prof. Alexander Nast (Table 2) and included the contributions of the participants of the consensus conference.</p>
        <p>The aim of the guideline is to provide a definition and classification of urticaria, thereby facilitating the interpretation of data from different centers and areas of the world regarding underlying causes, eliciting factors, comorbidities, burden to patients and society, and therapeutic responsiveness of subtypes of urticaria. Furthermore, the guideline provides recommendations for diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in common subtypes of urticaria. This is an international guideline and takes into consideration the global diversity of patients, physicians, medical systems and access to diagnosis and treatment.</p>
        <p>The detailed methods used to develop this guideline are published as a separate Methods Report, which is available on the EDF website alongside a separate Evidence Report including all evidence-todecision frameworks (https://www.edf.one/de/home/Guide lines/ EDF-EuroG uiDerm.html).</p>
        <p>The guideline takes into account the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) Instrument 5 and the methods suggested by the GRADE working group. The literature review was conducted using the methods given in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. 6 In summary, experts from 50 societies were nominated to be involved in the development of this update and revision of the guideline. All members of the expert panel received an invitation to submit a declaration of their conflicts of interest (COIs) online and to self-declare their personal financial interests (P-F), non-personal financial interests (NP-F), and personal non-financial interests (P-NF).</p>
        <p>An overview of the declarations of P-F conflicts of interests is given in the Methods Report. Overall, 40 members of the expert panel (62.5%) declared that they had no P-F COIs.</p>
        <p>For the 2021 update of the guideline, the same key questions were used as those developed for the version of the guideline published in 2018. Details on the processes used to develop these questions are available in the Methods Report of the latter. 7 The key questions were translated into the PICO format, which specifies the intervention, comparison and outcome used to assess efficacy and safety.</p>
        <p>Systematic searches for randomized controlled trials and clinical controlled trials were undertaken in three databases on 15 May 2020.</p>
        <p>The search identified a total of 2053 records. Two independent reviewers evaluated the literature and extracted eligible data. The removal of duplicates and title/abstract screening left 144 records to be assessed as full texts for eligibility, of which 123 were excluded. High (++++) We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of effect.</p>
        <p>We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.</p>
        <p>Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.</p>
        <p>We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.</p>
        <p>A total of 21 records were determined to fulfill the inclusion criteria.</p>
        <p>A graphical breakdown of this process and a list of excluded full-text publications with reasons for exclusion can be found in the separate Methods Report.</p>
        <p>Wherever possible, we calculated effect measures with confidence intervals and performed meta-analyses using 
            <rs type="software">Review Manager</rs>. 8 We assessed the quality of the evidence following the GRADE approach using GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool (GDT). 9,10 Five criteria (risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias) were evaluated for each outcome resulting in an overall assessment of quality of evidence (Table 3). Effect measures such as risk ratios express the size of an effect, and the quality rating expresses how much confidence one can have in a result.
        </p>
        <p>Subsequently, evidence-to-decision frameworks were created to help the expert panel make judgments for specific comparisons about the size of the desirable and undesirable effects, as well as the balance between these, and to provide an overview of the quality of the evidence. The evidence assessment yielded 14 new or updated GRADE evidence profiles and 14 new or updated evidenceto-decision frameworks. A summary of the evidence is given in the separate Evidence Report. Recommendations for each of the evidence-based key questions were subsequently drafted using standardized wording (Table 4).</p>
        <p>Before the consensus conference, two rounds of pre-voting were In the guideline itself, the strength of the consensus reached for each recommendation is reported as shown in Table 5.</p>
        <p>Each recommendation in the guideline is formatted as shown in Boxes 1-3. At the top of each box, the question of interest is given (eg, "Should we … in chronic urticaria?"). In the row below the question of interest, the recommendation is spelled out in full using the standardized wording and symbols shown in Table 4. In Box 1, for example, we can see that a strong recommendation is being made (ie, "We recommend…" and "↑↑" in dark green). Additionally, we can see, based on the information given on the right-hand side of this same row, that the eligible participants in the consensus conference agreed upon this recommendation and its wording with strong consensus (≥90% agreement) and that the recommendation is based on expert consensus. If the recommendation is based, additionally, on evidence from a systematic review of the literature, the phrase used here will read "Evidence-and consensus-based (see Evidence Report)" instead of "Expert consensus."</p>
        <p>If there are multiple recommendations that address the same question of interest and each of these recommendations was voted upon separately, these can be grouped together as shown in Box 2.</p>
        <p>In this case, the strength of consensus and the evidence base are given for each recommendation separately.</p>
        <p>In Box 3, we also see two recommendations instead of one.</p>
        <p>However, in this case, because these were voted on jointly in the consensus conference, the information on the strength of consensus and the evidence base are shown only once and apply to both recommendations.</p>
        <p>Urticaria is a condition characterized by the development of wheals (hives), angioedema, or both. Urticaria needs to be differentiated from other medical conditions where wheals, angioedema, or both</p>

        <p>Strong recommendation for the use of an intervention "We recommend..."</p>
        <p>We believe that all or almost all informed people would make a choice in favor of using this intervention. Clinicians will not have to spend as much time on the process of decision-making with the patient and may devote that time instead to overcoming barriers to implementation and adherence. In most clinical situations, the recommendation can be adopted as a policy.</p>
        <p>Weak recommendation for the use of an intervention "We suggest..."</p>
        <p>We believe that most informed people would make a choice in favor of using this intervention, but a substantial number would not. Clinicians and other healthcare providers will need to devote more time to the process of shared decision-making. Policy makers will have to involve many stakeholders and policy making will require substantial debate.</p>
        <p>No recommendation with respect to an intervention "We cannot make a recommendation with respect to..." 0 Currently, a recommendation in favor of or against using this intervention cannot be made due to certain circumstances (eg, unclear or balanced benefit-risk ratio, no data available).</p>

        <p>Strong recommendation against the use of an intervention "We recommend against..."</p>
        <p>We believe that all or almost all informed people would make a choice against using this intervention. This recommendation can be adopted as a policy in most clinical situations.</p>
        <p>The spectrum of clinical manifestations of different urticaria types and subtypes is very wide. Additionally, two or more different subtypes of urticaria can coexist in any given patient.</p>
        <p>Urticaria is classified based on its duration, as acute or chronic, and the role of definite triggers, as inducible or spontaneous. Acute urticaria is defined as the occurrence of wheals, angioedema, or both for 6 weeks or less. Chronic urticaria is defined as the occurrence of wheals, angioedema, or both for more than 6 weeks. Chronic urticaria can come with daily or almost daily signs and symptoms or an intermittent/recurrent course. CSU may recur after a months or years of full remission.</p>
        <p>Inducible urticaria is characterized by definite and subtypespecific triggers of the development of wheals, angioedema, or both.</p>
        <p>These triggers are definite because wheals, angioedema, or both always and never occur when the trigger is present and absent, respectively. These triggers are specific because each subtype of inducible urticaria has its relevant trigger, for example cold in cold urticaria, and this trigger is not relevant in other forms of inducible urticaria.</p>
        <p>Rare subtypes of inducible urticaria exist in which the combined presence of two or more definite and specific triggers is required for the induction of wheals, angioedema, or both, for example coldinduced cholinergic urticaria. 12 Some patients with spontaneous urticaria experience triggerinduced wheals, angioedema, or both. These triggers are not definite, as their presence does not always induce signs and symptoms and because wheals, angioedema, or both also occur without them, that is, spontaneously. Some patients can present with more than one subtype of urticaria, which can also respond independently to treatment. c Also called cold contact urticaria.</p>
        <p>d Also called pressure urticaria.</p>
        <p>e Also called heat contact urticaria.</p>
        <p>f Also called Vibratory angioedema/urticaria.</p>
        <p>How should urticaria be classified?</p>
        <p>We recommend that urticaria is classified based on its duration as acute (≤6 weeks) or chronic (&gt;6 weeks).</p>
        <p>Expert consensus 1</p>
        <p>We recommend that urticaria is classified as spontaneous (no definite eliciting factor involved) or inducible (specific definite factor involved).</p>
        <p>Expert consensus</p>
        <p>Table 6 shows the classification of chronic urticaria (CU) subtypes for clinical use. This classification has been maintained from the previous version of the guideline by strong consensus (≥90%).</p>
        <p>We recommend that the current guideline classification of chronic urticaria should be maintained.</p>
        <p>Expert consensus 1 ≥90% agreement Urticarial vasculitis, maculo-papular cutaneous mastocytosis (formerly called urticaria pigmentosa) and indolent systemic mastocytosis with involvement of the skin, mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), autoinflammatory syndromes (eg, cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes or Schnitzler's syndrome), non-mast cell mediator-mediated angioedema (eg, bradykinin-mediated angioedema), and other diseases and syndromes that can manifest with wheals and/or angioedema are not considered to be types of urticaria, due to their distinctly different pathophysiologic mechanisms and/or clinical presentation (Table 7).</p>
        <p>Urticaria is a predominantly mast cell-driven disease. 13 Histamine and other mediators, such as platelet-activating factor (PAF) and cytokines released from activated skin mast cells, result in sensory nerve activation, vasodilatation and plasma extravasation as well as cell recruitment to urticarial lesions. The mast cell-activating signals in urticaria are heterogeneous, diverse, and include T cell-driven cytokines and autoantibodies. Histologically, wheals are characterized by edema of the upper and mid dermis, with dilatation and augmented permeability of the postcapillary venules as well as lymphatic vessels of the upper dermis. In angioedema, similar changes occur primarily in the lower dermis and the subcutis. Skin affected by wheals shows a mixed inflammatory perivascular infiltrate of variable intensity, consisting of T cells, eosinophils, basophils, and other cells. Vessel-wall necrosis, a hallmark of urticarial vasculitis, does not occur in urticaria. [14][15][16][17][18] The nonlesional skin of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) patients shows upregulation of adhesion molecules, infiltrating eosinophils, altered cytokine expression 19 and sometimes a mild-to-moderate increase of mast cell numbers. 13 These findings underline the complex nature of the pathogenesis of urticaria, which has many features in addition to the release of histamine from dermal mast cells. [20][21][22] Some of these features of urticaria are also seen in a wide variety of inflammatory conditions and are thus not specific or of diagnostic value. A search for more specific histological biomarkers for different subtypes of urticaria and for distinguishing urticaria from other conditions is desirable. 23</p>
        <p>The burden of CU for patients, their family and friends, the healthcare system and society is substantial. 24 The use of patient-reported outcome measures such as the urticaria activity score (UAS), the angioedema activity score (AAS), the CU quality of life questionnaire (CU-Q2oL), the angioedema quality of life questionnaire (AE-QoL), the urticaria control test (UCT), and the angioedema control test (AECT) in studies and clinical practice has helped to better define the effects and impact of CU on patients. 25 The available data indicate that urticaria markedly affects both objective functioning and subjective well-being. Note: These diseases and syndromes are related to urticaria 1) because they can present with wheals, angioedema, or both and/or 2) because of historical reasons. They are differential diagnoses of urticaria.</p>
        <p>Detailed history taking is essential in urticaria; it is the first step in the diagnostic workup of all urticaria patients. The second step is the physical examination of the patient. As wheals and angioedema are transient and may not be present at the time of physical examination, it is important to review patients' documentation of signs and symptoms (including pictures of wheals and/or angioedema). The third step, in chronic urticaria, is a basic diagnostic workup, with limited tests (see Table 8; recommended routine diagnostic tests).</p>
        <p>Further individually selected diagnostic tests may be useful, based on the outcome of the first three steps and depending on the urticaria type and subtype (Table 8; extended diagnostic program). The aims of all diagnostic tests performed should be clear to the physician and patient.</p>
        <p>Acute urticaria, because it is self-limiting, usually does not require a diagnostic workup apart from anamnesis for possible trigger factors. The only exception is the suspicion of acute urticaria due to a type I food allergy in sensitized patients or drug hypersensitivity, especially for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).</p>
        <p>In this case, allergy tests and patient education may be useful to allow patients to avoid re-exposure to relevant causative factors. b Unless strongly suggested by patient history, for example, allergy.</p>
        <p>c All tests are done with different levels of the potential trigger to determine the threshold.</p>
        <p>d For details on provocation and threshold testing see 45 e For patients in specialist care Should routine diagnostic measures be performed in acute urticaria?</p>
        <p>We recommend against any routine diagnostic measures in acute spontaneous urticaria.</p>
        <p>Expert consensus 1 ≥90% agreement</p>
        <p>In CSU, the diagnostic workup has seven major aims. They are to confirm the diagnosis and exclude differential diagnoses; to look for the underlying causes; to identify relevant conditions that modify disease activity;</p>
        <p>to check for comorbidities; to identify the consequences of CSU; to assess predictors of the course of disease and response to treatment; and to monitor disease activity, impact, and control (Table 9). 34 In all CSU patients, the diagnostic workup includes a thorough history, physical examination (including review of pictures of wheals and/ or angioedema), basic tests, and the assessment of disease activity, impact, and control. The basic tests include a differential blood count and CRP and/or ESR, in all patients, and total IgE and IG-anti-TPO, in patients in specialist care. Based on the results obtained by these measures, further diagnostic testing may be performed as indicated.</p>
        <p>Wheals or angioedema also occur in patients with diseases other than CSU (Figure 1). In patients who exclusively develop wheals (but not angioedema), urticarial vasculitis and autoinflammatory disorders such as Schnitzler syndrome or cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) need to be ruled out. On the contrary, in patients who suffer exclusively from recurrent angioedema (but not from wheals), bradykinin-mediated angioedema-like angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor-induced angioedema and HAE should be considered as differential diagnoses (Figure 1). The assessment of patients for differential diagnoses of CSU is guided by the history (Figure 1) and supported by basic tests, for example, CRP and/or ESR, differential blood count.</p>
        <p>Further testing should be performed only as indicated by the results of the history, physical examination, and basic testing.</p>
        <p>We recommend that differential diagnoses be considered in all patients with signs or symptoms suggestive of chronic urticaria based on the guideline algorithm.</p>
        <p>Expert consensus</p>
        <p>What routine diagnostic measures should be performed in chronic spontaneous urticaria?</p>
        <p>We recommend limited investigations. Basic tests include differential blood count, CRP and/or ESR, and in specialized care total IgE and IgG anti-TPO, and more biomarkers as appropriate. We recommend performing further diagnostic measures based on the patient history and examination, especially in patients with long-standing and/or uncontrolled disease.</p>
        <p>Expert consensus 1 &gt;75% agreement</p>
        <p>We recommend using provocation testing to diagnose chronic inducible urticaria. We recommend using provocation threshold measurements and the UCT to measure disease activity and control in patients with chronic inducible urticaria, respectively.</p>
        <p>Expert consensus 11 In some rare cases recurrent angioedema is neither mast cell mediator-mediated nor bradykinin-mediated, and the underlying pathomechanisms remain unknown. These rare cases are referred to as "idiopathic angioedema" by some authors. (UAS, and the weekly urticaria activity score, that is, UAS7, calculated from it), the angioedema activity score (AAS), the chronic urticaria quality of life questionnaire (CU-Q2oL), the angioedema quality of life questionnaire (AE-QoL), the urticaria control test (UCT), and the angioedema control test (AECT) should be used for this purpose. 38,39 PROMs are available in a wide range of languages.</p>
        <p>In CSU patients who develop wheals, disease activity should be assessed both in clinical care and trials with the UAS7 (Table 10), a unified and simple scoring system that was proposed in the last version of the guideline and has been validated. 40,41 The UAS7 is based on the assessment of key urticaria signs and symptoms (wheals and pruritus), which are documented by the patient, making this score especially valuable. The use of the UAS7 facilitates comparison of study results from different centers. As urticaria activity frequently changes, the overall disease activity is best measured by advising patients to document 24h self-evaluation scores once daily for several days. The UAS7, that is, the sum score of 7 consecutive days, should be used in routine clinical practice to determine disease activity and response to treatment of patients with CSU. For CSU patients who develop angioedema, with or without wheals, the Angioedema Activity Score (AAS) should be used to assess disease activity (Table 10). 42 CSU patients who experience wheals and angioedema should use the UAS7 and the AAS in combination.</p>
        <p>In addition to disease activity, it is important to assess the impact of disease on quality of life as well as disease control both in clinical practice and trials. The CU-Q2oL should be used to determine QoL impairment in CSU patients with wheals. For CSU patients with angioedema, with or without wheals, the AE-QoL should be used. In CSU patients with wheals and angioedema, the CU-Q2oL and the AE-QoL should be used.</p>
        <p>It is also important to assess disease control in patients with CSU. The urticaria control test (UCT) should be used to do this in CSU patients who develop wheals, with or without angioedema (Figure 2A). For CSU patients who develop angioedema, with or without wheals, the angioedema control test (AECT) should be used (Figure 2B). In CSU patients who develop wheals and angioedema, both the UCT and the AECT should be used. The UCT was developed and validated to determine the level of disease control in all forms of CU (CSU and CIndU). 43,44 The UCT is a simple four-item tool with a clearly defined cutoff for patients with "well-controlled" vs. "poorly controlled" disease, and it is thus suited for the management of patients in routine clinical practice. Note: For the UAS7, the sum of the score (0-3 for wheals +0-3 for pruritis) for each day is summarized over one week (7 days) for a maximum of 42.</p>
        <p>For the AAS, scores are summed up to an AAS day sum score (0-15), 7 AAS day sum scores to an AAS week sum score (AAS7, 0-105), and 4 ASS week sum scores may be summed up to an AAS 4-week sum score (AAS28, 0-420).

        <p>well-controlled disease is 10 points. Both the UCT and the AECT are easy to administer, complete, and score, and can help to guide treatment decisions.</p>
        <p>We recommend that patients with CU be assessed for disease activity, impact, and control at every visit.</p>
        <p>Expert consensus</p>
        <p>Which instruments should be used to assess and monitor disease activity in chronic spontaneous urticaria patients?</p>
        <p>We recommend the use of the urticaria activity score, UAS7, and/or of the angioedema activity score, AAS, for assessing disease activity in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria.</p>
        <p>Expert consensus</p>
        <p>We recommend the use of the chronic urticaria quality of life questionnaire, CU-Q2oL, and the angioedema quality of life questionnaire, AE-QoL, for assessing quality of life impairment in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria.</p>
        <p>Expert consensus 1 ≥90% agreement</p>
        <p>We recommend the use of the urticaria control test, UCT, and/or the angioedema control test, AECT, for assessing disease control in patients with CSU.</p>
        <p>Expert consensus 1 ≥90% agreement</p>
        <p>In patients with CIndU, the routine diagnostic workup should follow the consensus recommendations on the definition, diagnostic testing, and management of CindUs. 45 Diagnostics in CIndU aim to exclude differential diagnoses, to identify the subtype of CIndU, and to determine trigger thresholds. 45 The last of these is important as it allows for assessing disease activity and response to treatment.</p>
        <p>For most CIndU subtypes, validated tools for provocation testing are available. 45 Examples include cold and heat urticaria, where a Peltier element-based provocation device (TempTest ® ) is available, 46 symptomatic dermographism for which dermographometers (Dermographic Tester, FricTest) have been developed, 47,48 and delayed pressure urticaria (Dermographic Tester). In cholinergic urticaria, a graded provocation test with office-based methods, for example, pulse-controlled ergometry, is available. 49,50 Patients with contact urticaria or aquagenic urticaria should be assessed by appropriate cutaneous provocation tests. 45 Disease control, in patients with CIndU, is assessed by provocation threshold testing and use of the UCT and AECT. Patientreported outcome measures for disease activity and impact are available or being developed for some CindUs. 50,51 F I G U R E 2 A: The urticaria control test (UCT) and B: the angioedema control test (AECT).

        <p>Urticaria can occur in all age groups, including infants and young children. Recent reports indicate that, in children, the prevalence of CIndUs and CSU, disease characteristics, underlying causes of CSU, and response to treatment are very similar to those in adults. [52][53][54][55][56][57][58][59] The diagnostic workup of CSU in children has the same aims as in adults. Differential diagnoses should be excluded with a special focus on cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS). CAPS is a rare disease with a urticaria-like rash that manifests in childhood. 60 If possible, that is, depending on the age of the child, disease activity, impact, and control should be assessed using assessment tools similar to those used in adults, although it has to be noted that no validated diseasespecific tools for children are available as of now. Triggers of exacerbation should be identified and, where indicated, underlying causes, which appear to be similar to those in adults, should be searched for.</p>
        <p>In children with CIndU, similar tests for provocation and the determination of trigger thresholds should be performed (insofar as this is possible in terms of age-related cooperation).</p>
        <p>1. The goal of treatment is to treat the disease until it is gone and as efficiently and safely as possible aiming at a continuous UAS7 = 0, complete control and a normalization of quality of life. (Figure 3). It is important to highlight that patients need good counseling regarding continuous treatment and using patientreported outcome measures (PROMs), especially UAS.</p>
        <p>We recommend aiming at complete symptom control in urticaria, considering as much as possible the safety and the quality of life of each individual patient.</p>
        <p>Expert consensus 1 ≥90% agreement</p>
        <p>Although desirable, the elimination of underlying causes is not possible in most patients with urticaria. The underlying causes of CIndU are unknown, the underlying causes of acute spontaneous urticaria remain unknown in most patients, and the most common underlying causes of CSU, type I and type IIb autoimmunity, cannot be eliminated.</p>
        <p>The reduction of autoantibodies by plasmapheresis has been shown to be of temporary benefit in some, severely affected patients with CSU, 61 but experience and evidence are limited and costs are high.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the avoidance of triggering factors, where possible, can be of benefit for patients with urticaria. 62 In CIndU, avoidance of specific and definite triggers for the development of signs and symptoms, for example, cold in cold urticaria, can reduce disease activity. In CSU, avoidance of individually relevant and unspecific triggers, for example stress or the intake of NSAIDs, can help to reduce disease exacerbations. Importantly, the avoidance of triggers, in patients with CIndU and in patients with CSU, can result in markedly impaired quality of life, for example in patients with cholinergic urticaria who abstain from physical exercise or in patients with solar urticaria who avoid being outside.</p>
        <p>When these agents are suspected in the course of diagnostic workup, they should be omitted entirely or substituted by another class of agents if indispensable. Drugs causing non-allergic hypersensitivity reactions (the prototypes being NSAIDs) cannot only elicit, but can also aggravate preexisting CSU, so that elimination in the latter case will only improve symptoms in some patients.</p>
        <p>Should patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria be advised to discontinue medication that is suspected to worsen the disease?</p>
        <p>We recommend advising patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria to discontinue medication that is suspected to worsen the disease, for example, NSAIDs.</p>

        <p>Avoidance of the specific and definite triggers of CIndUs can help to reduce the occurrence of wheals and angioedema, but usually does not suffice to control the disease and can come with a substantial burden.</p>
        <p>Patients should be provided with information that helps them to recognize and minimize relevant trigger exposure. Patients with delayed pressure urticaria, for example, should be informed that pressure is defined as force per area and that simple measures, such as broadening of the handle of heavy bags may be helpful in the prevention of symptoms. Similar considerations hold for cold urticaria where the impact of the wind chill factor in cold winds needs to be remembered. For solar urticaria, the exact identification of the range of eliciting wavelengths may be important for the appropriate selection of sunscreens or for the selection of light bulbs with an UV-A filter. However, in many patients, the threshold for the relevant physical trigger is low and total avoidance of symptoms is virtually impossible. For example, severe symptomatic dermographism is sometimes confused with CSU because seemingly spontaneous hives are observed where even loose-fitting clothing rubs on the patient's skin or unintentional scratching by patients readily causes the development of wheals in that area.</p>
        <p>In contrast to CIndU, CSU has been reported to be associated with a variety of inflammatory or infectious diseases. This is regarded as significant in some instances, but studies show conflicting results</p>
        <p>and have methodological weaknesses. Infections that may contribute to CSU disease activity include those of the gastrointestinal tract like H. pylori infection and bacterial infections of the nasopharynx 63 (even if association with urticaria is not clear in the individual patient and a meta-analysis shows overall low evidence for eradication therapy, 63 H. pylori should be eliminated as an association with gastric cancer is suggested 64 ). Bowel parasites, a rare possible cause of CSU in developed industrial countries, should be eliminated if indicated. 63,65 In the past, intestinal candidiasis was regarded as a highly important underlying cause of CSU, 63 but more recent findings fail to support a significant causative role. 66 Apart from infectious diseases, chronic inflammatory processes due to diverse other diseases have been identified as potentially triggering CSU. These can be secondary to infections. This holds particularly for gastritis, reflux esophagitis, or inflammation of the bile duct or gall bladder. 67,68 Thus, it could be shown that successful eradication of helicobacter is only having an impact on CSU if also the subsequent inflammation, that Step-up * if:</p>
        <p>Step-down* Continue therapy and try to optimize -On 1-4 fold 2gAH &gt; 7-28d -On OMA &gt; 3m based on individual factors by reducing dose or extending intervals is, gastritis and esophagitis is healed. 69 However, similar to infections, it is not easily possible to discern whether any of these are relevant causes of CSU but should be treated as many of them may be also associated with development of malignancies.</p>
        <p>Although the mechanisms of stress-induced exacerbation are not well investigated, some evidence indicates that disease activity in patients with CSU can be linked to stress. 70 Further studies are needed to characterize the prevalence and relevance of CSU exacerbation by stress as well as the underlying mechanisms.</p>
        <p>Direct reduction of functional autoantibodies by plasmapheresis has been shown to be of temporary benefit in some, severely affected patients. 61 Due to limited experience and high costs, this therapy is suggested for autoantibody-positive CSU patients who are unresponsive to all other forms of treatment. Autoantibodies and potentially activated T cells may also be reduced by immunosuppressive medication, such as cicloporin. 71</p>
        <p>IgE-mediated food allergy is extremely rarely the underlying cause of CSU. 72,73 If identified, the specific food allergens need to be omitted as far as possible, which leads to a remission within less than 24 h.</p>
        <p>In some CSU patients, pseudoallergic reactions (non-IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions) to naturally occurring food ingredients and in some cases to food additives have been observed. [72][73][74][75][76][77] A pseudoallergen-free diet, containing only low levels of natural and artificial food pseudoallergens, has been tested in different countries, 78 and also, a low histamine diet may improve symptoms in some patients. 79 Those diets are controversial and as yet unproven in welldesigned double-blinded placebo-controlled studies. When used they must usually be maintained for a minimum of 2-3 weeks before beneficial effects are observed. This kind of treatment requires cooperative patients, and success rates may vary considerably due to regional differences in food and dietary habits. More research is necessary on the effects of natural and artificial ingredients of food on urticaria.</p>
        <p>Inducing tolerance can be useful in some subtypes of CIndU. Examples are cold urticaria, cholinergic urticaria, and solar urticaria, where a rush therapy with UV-A has been reported to be effective within 3 days. 80 However, tolerance induction is only lasting for a few days; thus, a consistent daily exposure to the stimulus just at threshold level is required. Tolerance induction and maintenance are often not accepted by patients, for example, in the case of cold urticaria where daily cold baths/showers are needed to achieve this.</p>
        <p>Current recommended treatment options for urticaria aim to target mast cell mediators such as histamine, or activators, such as autoantibodies. Novel treatments currently under development aim to silence mast cells via inhibitory receptors or to reduce mast cell numbers. The overall goal of all of these symptomatic treatments is to help patients to be free of signs and symptoms until their urticaria shows spontaneous remission. To achieve this, pharmacological treatment should be continuous, until no longer needed. Non-sedating 2nd generation H 1 -antihistamines, for example, should be used daily, to prevent the occurrence of wheals and angioedema, rather than on demand. This is supported by their safety profile (safety data are available for several years of continuous use), the results of randomized controlled trials and real-life studies, 81,82 and their mechanism of action, that is, their inverse agonist effects on the H 1 receptor, stabilizing its inactive state. Some patients with CIndU can benefit from short-term prophylactic antihistamine treatment before relevant trigger exposure.</p>
        <p>H 1 -antihistamines have been available for the treatment of urticaria since the 1950s. The older 1st generation H 1 -antihistamines have pronounced anticholinergic and sedative effects, and many interactions with alcohol and other drugs, such as analgesics, hypnotics, sedatives, and mood-elevating drugs, have been described. They can also interfere with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and impact on learning and performance. Impairment is particularly prominent during multi-tasking and performance of complex sensorimotor tasks such as driving. In a GA²LEN position paper, 83 it is strongly recommended not to use 1st generation H 1 -antihistamines any longer in allergy both for adults and especially in children. This view is shared by the WHO guideline ARIA. 84 Based on strong evidence regarding potentially serious side effects of 1st generation H 1 -antihistamines (lethal overdoses have been reported), we recommend against their use for the routine management of CU as first-line agents.</p>
        <p>Modern 2nd generation H 1 -antihistamines are minimally or nonsedating and free of anticholinergic effects. 85 However, two 2nd generation H 1 -antihistamines, astemizole and terfenadine, are shown to have cardiotoxic effects in patients treated with inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isoenzyme, such as ketoconazole or erythromycin. Astemizole and terfenadine are no longer available in most countries, and we recommend that they are not used.</p>
        <p>Most but not all 2nd generation H 1 -antihistamines have been tested specifically in urticaria, and evidence supports the use of bilastine, cetirizine, desloratadine, ebastine, fexofenadine, levocetirizine, loratadine, and rupatadine. We recommend the use of a standarddosed modern 2 nd generation H 1 -antihistamines as the first-line symptomatic treatment for urticaria. However, no recommendation can be made on which to choose because, to date, well-designed clinical trials comparing the efficacy and safety of all modern 2nd generation H 1antihistamines in urticaria are largely lacking.</p>
        <p>We recommend a 2nd Several studies show the benefit of the use of a higher than standarddosed 2nd generation H 1 -antihistamines in urticaria patients [86][87][88] corroborating earlier studies with 1st generation H 1 -antihistamines that came to the same conclusion. 89,90 Studies support the use of up to fourfold standard-dosed bilastine, cetirizine, desloratadine, ebastine, fexofenadine, levocetirizine, and rupatadine. 86,87,[91][92][93][94] If there is no improvement, should higher than fourfold doses of 2nd generation H 1 -antihistamines be used?</p>
        <p>We recommend against using higher than fourfold standarddosed H 1 -antihistamines in chronic urticaria ↓↓</p>
        <p>Evidence-and consensusbased (see Evidence Report)</p>
        <p>In summary, these studies suggest that some patients with urticaria, who show insufficient response to a standard-dosed 2nd generation H 1 -antihistamine, benefit from updosing which is preferred over mixing different 2nd generation H 1 -antihistamines as their pharmacologic properties are different. We, therefore, recommend to increase the dose up to fourfold, in such patients (Figure 4). Patients need to be informed that 2nd generation H 1 -antihistamine updosing is off-label and higher than fourfold is not recommended as it has not been tested.</p>
        <p>However, updosing has been suggested in the guidelines for urticaria since the year 2000 and so far no serious adverse events have been reported, nor has a side effect ever been reported in the literature attributed to long-term intake and potential accumulation.</p>
        <p>Omalizumab is the only other licensed treatment in urticaria for patients who do not show sufficient benefit from treatment with a 2nd generation H 1 -antihistamine, and therefore the next step in the algorithm.</p>
        <p>Omalizumab (anti-IgE) has been shown to be very effective and safe in the treatment of CSU. [95][96][97][98][99][100] Omalizumab has also been reported to be effective in CIndU [101][102][103] including cholinergic urticaria, 104 cold urticaria, 105,106 solar urticaria, 107 heat urticaria, 108 symptomatic dermographism, 109,110 and delayed pressure urticaria. 111 In CSU, omalizumab prevents wheal and angioedema development, 112 markedly improves quality of life, 113,114 is suitable for long-term treatment, 115 and effectively treats relapse after discontinuation. 115,116 The recommended initial dose in CSU is 300 mg every 4 weeks. Dosing is independent of total serum IgE. 117 Patients with urticaria who do not show sufficient benefit from treatment with omalizumab at the licensed dose of 300 mg every 4 weeks can be treated with omalizumab at higher doses, shorter intervals, or both. Studies support the use of omalizumab treatment at doses up to 600 mg and intervals of 2 weeks, in patients with insufficient response to standard-dosed omalizumab. [118][119][120][121] Patients need to be informed that omalizumab updosing is off-label.</p>
        <p>We recommend adding on omalizumab* for the treatment of patients with CU unresponsive to high dose 2nd</p>
        <p>Patients with urticaria who do not show sufficient benefit from treatment with omalizumab, should be treated with ciclosporin 3.5-5 mg/ kg per day. Ciclosporin is immunosuppressive and has a moderate, direct effect on mast cell mediator release. 122,123 Efficacy of ciclosporin in combination with a modern 2nd generation H 1 -antihistamine has been shown in placebo-controlled trials 71,124,125 as well as open controlled trials 126 in CSU, but this drug cannot be recommended as standard treatment due to a higher incidence of adverse effects. 124 Ciclosporin is off-label for urticaria and is recommended only for patients with severe disease refractory to any dose of antihistamine and omalizumab in combination. However, ciclosporin has a far better risk/benefit ratio compared with long-term use of steroids.</p>
        <p>We suggest using ciclosporin for the treatment of patients with CU unresponsive to high dose of 2nd Depending on the country, it must be noted that steroids are also not licensed for CU (eg, in Germany prednisolone is only licensed for acute urticaria). For acute urticaria and acute exacerbations of CSU, a short course of oral corticosteroids, that is, treatment of a maximum of up to 10 days, may, however, be helpful to reduce disease duration/activity. 127,128 Nevertheless, well-designed RCTs are lacking.</p>
        <p>Should oral corticosteroids be used as add-on treatment in the treatment of urticaria?</p>
        <p>We recommend against the long-term use of systemic glucocorticosteroids in CU. to the algorithm but it is acknowledged that omalizumab has restrictions due to its high cost and ciclosporin due to its safety profile.</p>
        <p>Since the severity of urticaria may fluctuate, and spontaneous remission may occur at any time, it is also recommended to reevaluate the necessity for continued or alternative drug treatment every 3-6 months. This is also reflected in Figure 3.</p>
        <p>All treatments not listed in the treatment algorithm (Figure 4) are based on clinical trials with low levels of evidence (Table 11).</p>
        <p>H₂-antagonists and dapsone, recommended in the previous versions of the guideline, are now perceived to have little evidence to maintain them as recommendable in the algorithm but they may still have relevance as they are very affordable in some more restricted healthcare systems.</p>
        <p>Sulfasalazine, methotrexate, interferon, plasmapheresis, phototherapy, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG/IGIV), and other treatment options have low-quality evidence or just case series have been published 2 (Table 11). Despite the lack of published evidence, all these drugs may be of value to individual patients in the appropriate clinical context. 129</p>
        <p>We cannot make a recommendation for or against the combined use of H 1 -and H 2 -antihistamines in patients with chronic urticaria. 0</p>
        <p>Expert consensus 1 ≥90% agreement Antagonists of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) 130 and IVIG, [131][132][133][134] which have been successfully used in case reports, are recommended currently only to be used in specialized centers as last option (ie, anti-TNF-alpha for delayed pressure urticaria and IVIG/IGIV for CSU). 135,136 For the treatment of CSU and symptomatic dermographism, UV-B (narrow band-UVB, TL01), UV-A, and PUVA treatment for 1-3 months can be added to antihistamine treatment [137][138][139] but caution should be taking regarding the carcinogenic properties of UV light treatment. Some treatment alternatives formerly proposed have been shown</p>
        <p>to be ineffective in double-blind, placebo-controlled studies and should no longer be used as the grade of recommendation is low. These include tranexamic acid and sodium cromoglycate in CSU, 140,141 nifedipine in symptomatic dermographism/urticaria factitia 142 and colchicine and indomethacin in delayed pressure urticaria. 143,144 However, more research may be needed for patient subgroups, for example, a pilot study 145 of patients with elevated D-dimer levels showed heparin and tranexamic acid therapy may be effective.</p>
        <p>We cannot make a recommendation with respect to further treatment options as standard therapies, but these may be considered in special cases, which also include those where financial or legal limitations for the recommended algorithm treatment exist. b Does include low histamine diet as pseudoallergen-free diet is also low in histamine.</p>
        <p>c No longer available in most countries; alternative H2-antihistamines are available including famotidine and nizatidine but evidence for their use in chronic urticaria varies. d Treatment can be considered especially if CSU and DPU are co-existent in a patient.</p>
        <p>been systematically studied in pregnant women with urticaria, it should be pointed out that the possible negative effects of increased levels of histamine receptor binding occurring in urticaria have also not been studied in pregnancy. Regarding treatment, no reports of birth defects in women having used modern 2nd generation H 1 -antihistamines during pregnancy have been reported to date. However, only small sample size studies are available for cetirizine 153 and one large meta-analysis for loratadine. 154 Furthermore, as several modern 2nd generation H 1 -antihistamines are now prescription free and used widely in both allergic rhinitis and urticaria, it must be assumed that many women have used these drugs especially in the beginning of pregnancy, at least before the pregnancy was confirmed. Nevertheless, since the highest safety is mandatory in pregnancy, the suggestion for the use of modern 2nd generation H 1 -antihistamines is to prefer loratadine with the possible extrapolation to desloratadine and cetirizine with a possible extrapolation to levocetirizine. All H 1 -antihistamines are excreted in breast milk in low concentrations. Use of 2nd generation H 1 -antihistamines is advised, as nursing infants occasionally develop sedation from the old 1st generation H 1 -antihistamines transmitted in breast milk.</p>
        <p>The increased dosage of modern 2nd generation H 1antihistamines can only be carefully suggested in pregnancy since safety studies have not been done, and with loratadine, it must be remembered that this drug is metabolized in the liver which is not the case for its metabolite desloratadine. 1st generation H 1 -antihistamines should be avoided. 83 The use of omalizumab in pregnancy has been reported to be safe, and to date, there is no indication of teratogenicity. [155][156][157][158] All further steps should be based on individual considerations, with a preference for medications that have a satisfactory risk-to-benefit ratio in pregnant women and neonates with regard to teratogenicity and embryotoxicity. For example, ciclosporin, although not teratogenic, is embryo-toxic in animal models and is associated with preterm delivery and low birth weight in human infants. Whether the benefits of ciclosporin in CU are worth, the risks in pregnant women will have to be determined on a case-by-case basis. However, all decisions should be re-evaluated according to the current recommendations published by regulatory authorities.</p>
        <p>Should the same treatment algorithm be used in pregnant women and during lactation?</p>
        <p>We suggest using the same treatment algorithm with caution both in pregnant and lactating women after riskbenefit assessment. Drugs contraindicated or not suitable in pregnancy should not be used.</p>
