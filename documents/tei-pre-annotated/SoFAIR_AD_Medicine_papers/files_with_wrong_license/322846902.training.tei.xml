        <p>To the editor, In a recent review article, there were multiple preventive measures that were proposed for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [1]. Since 2002, we had witnessed the emergence of three coronaviruses with a significant impact. These are the Severe Acute Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and according to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global number of cases is 80239 confirmed as of February 25, 2020 [2]. However, there is no recommended therapy for any of these CoVs.To the editor, In a recent review article, there were multiple preventive measures that were proposed for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [1].

        <p>Remdesivir (with a development code GS-5734) is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent. This medication is an experimental drug and had not been licensed or approved at the time of writing this article. It was synthesized and developed by Gilead Sciences in 2017 as a treatment for Ebola virus infection. It is a monophosphoramidate prodrug and is an adenosine analog.Remdesivir (with a development code GS-5734) is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent.

        <p>Remdesivir is metabolizes into its active form, GS-441524, that obscures viral RNA polymerase and evades proofreading by viral exonuclease, causing a decrease in viral RNA production. The antiviral mechanism for remdesivir is a delayed chain cessation of nascent viral RNA of Ebola virus. Remdesivir showed antiviral activity against multiple variants of Ebola virus in cell-based assays [3] as well as in a rhesus monkey model of Ebola virus disease, [4]. Remdesivir was given on a compassionate-use basis to a British nurse who survived Ebola virus disease when she relapsed nine months later in the United Kingdom with meningoencephalitis [5]. In a randomized controlled trial of Ebola Virus disease therapeutics, 673 participants received one of three monoclonal antibodies (Zmapp, mAb114 or REGN-EB3) or remdesivir [6]. However, the study was stopped as an interim analysis found that individuals who received REGN-EB3 or mAb114 had greater survival than either ZMapp or remdesivir [6].Remdesivir is metabolizes into its active form, GS-441524, that obscures viral RNA polymerase and evades proofreading by viral exonuclease, causing a decrease in viral RNA production.

        <p>In-vitro studies showed that remdesivir can inhibit coronavirus such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication. In an in-vitro test utilizing epithelial cell cultures of a primary human airway, remdesivir was effective against bat CoVs, prepandemic bat CoVs, and circulating contemporary human CoV in primary human lung cells [7,8]. One study showed that remdesiv and interferon beta were superior to lopinavir, ritonavir and interferon beta both in vitro and in MERS-CoV mouse model [9].In-vitro studies showed that remdesivir can inhibit coronavirus such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication.

        <p>With the emergence of the 2019-nCoV (COVID-19), we are in a need for an effective antiviral agent to be able to halt the current outbreak. It had been suggested that remdesivir might be an option for the therapy of the COVID-19 patients [10]. In a case report, remdisivir reatment with started intravenous on day 7 in a patient with 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) [11].With the emergence of the 2019-nCoV (COVID-19), we are in a need for an effective antiviral agent to be able to halt the current outbreak.

        <p>Given the broad-spectrum anti-CoV activity of remdesivir demonstrated in pre-clinical studies; a randomized, controlled, double blind clinical trial is planned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in hospitalized patients with mild or moderate 2019-nCoV respiratory disease [12].Given the broad-spectrum anti-CoV activity of remdesivir demonstrated in pre-clinical studies; a randomized, controlled, double blind clinical trial is planned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in hospitalized patients with mild or moderate 2019-nCoV respiratory disease [12].</p>
        <p>This clinical trial has already involved 308 hospitalized adult patients with mild and moderate 2019-nCoV respiratory disease. The participants were randomized to either placebo or remdesivir 200 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 100 mg iv once-daily as maintenance doses for 9 days. The primary outcome was defined as the Time to Clinical recovery (TTCR), up to 28 days [12]. TTCR is defined as the time (in hours) from initiation of study treatment (active or placebo) until normalization of fever, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, and alleviation of cough, sustained for at least 72 hours [12].
