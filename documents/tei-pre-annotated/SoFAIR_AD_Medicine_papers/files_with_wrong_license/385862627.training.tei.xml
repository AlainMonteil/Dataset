        <p>Mycorrhizas are among the most significant biological inter-kingdom interactions, as they involve ~340,000 land plants and ~50,000 taxa of soil fungi. In these mutually beneficial interactions, fungi receive photosynthesis-derived carbon and provide the host plant with mineral nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen in exchange. Over 150 years of research on mycorrhizas has raised awareness of their biology, biodiversity and ecological impact. In this Review, we focus on recent phylogenomic, molecular and cell biology studies to present the current state of knowledge on the origin of mycorrhizal fungi and the evolutionary history of their relationship with land plants. As mycorrhizas feature a variety of phenotypes, depending on partner taxonomy, physiology and cellular interactions, we explore similarities and differences between mycorrhizal types. During evolution, mycorrhizal fungi have refined their biotrophic capabilities to take advantage of their hosts as food sources and protective niches, while plants have developed multiple strategies to accommodate diverse fungal symbionts. Intimate associations with pervasive ecological success have originated at the crossroads between these two evolutionary pathways. Our understanding of the biological processes underlying these symbioses, where fungi act as biofertilisers and bioprotectors, provides the tools to design biotechnological applications addressing environmental and agricultural challenges.Mycorrhizas are among the most significant biological inter-kingdom interactions, as they involve ~340,000 land plants and ~50,000 taxa of soil fungi.

        <p>Mycorrhizas are ubiquitous mutualistic symbioses established between plant roots and soil fungi. Across the intimate cellular contact between the two symbiotic partners, mycorrhizal fungi receive fixed carbon from their photosynthetic hosts in exchange for mineral nutrients, such as phosphorus and nitrogen, with a positive impact on plant growth 1 . The beneficial effect of symbiosis on host plants also includes an increased tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses 2 . In addition, mycorrhizas offer several ecosystem services in natural and agricultural environments. In fact, mycorrhizal fungi are known drivers of carbon sequestration 3 and particle aggregation in soil, and have a major impact on the composition of microbial and plant communities 4 . For these reasons, mycorrhizas are believed to have shaped biosphere evolution since plant terrestrialization and, in the current context of growing environmental concerns, they represent crucial actors of ecosystem functioning 4,5 .Mycorrhizas are ubiquitous mutualistic symbioses established between plant roots and soil fungi.

        <p>Between 320,000 and 340,000 extant vascular and non-vascular plants can form mycorrhizas 6 . Among them, angiosperms account for the largest and most diverse group of mycorrhizal species (~85-90%). They include trees, shrubs, herbs and the majority of staple crops such as rice, wheat, maize, potato, sweet potato, tomato and cassava 7 . As for the fungal partners, at least 50,000 fungal species of Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Mucoromycota are estimated to form mycorrhizas 4 . This startling diversity, supported by over 400 million years of co-evolution between plants and fungi, has generated four main mycorrhizal types that have emerged at different times during plant evolution and feature specific morphological traits: ectomycorrhizas (ECM), arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM), orchid mycorrhizas (ORM) and ericoid mycorrhizas (ERM; Fig. 1). Cell-to-cell interactions in each mycorrhizal type (Box 1) have fascinated plant biologists since the pioneering ultrastructural observations in the 1980s 8,9 and set the foundation for subsequent investigations on signaling and gene regulation in these symbioses.Between 320,000 and 340,000 extant vascular and non-vascular plants can form mycorrhizas 6 .

        <p>Mycorrhizas are formed by the majority of plants, but display an uneven distribution: AM are the dominant type (72%), followed by ORM (10%), ECM (2%) and ERM (1.4%) 6 . Multiple mycorrhizal types co-exist in many ecosystems, with plant and fungal species establishing -in some cases -more than one mycorrhizal type (Fig. 1). In addition, a single fungus can colonize different hosts, establishing a 'common mycorrhizal network' (Fig. 1), that is, an underground hyphal network connecting distinct plant individuals 10 .Mycorrhizas are formed by the majority of plants, but display an uneven distribution: AM are the dominant type (72%), followed by ORM (10%), ECM (2%) and ERM (1.4%) 6 .

        <p>In this Review, we explore the biological diversity of mycorrhizas, which have historically been grouped according to their morphological features (Box 1), through the identification of unique and common traits between types. Fossil data and phylogenomic studies offer an evolution-based guideline to illustrate how ancient saprotrophic fungi feeding on decaying organic matter evolved a novel nutritional strategy based on biotrophism . Furthermore, we discuss how fungal biotrophism is supported by multiple signalling and colonization processes, underpinned by relatively conserved genetic bases in plants. Lastly, we outline the potential of mycorrhizal symbioses as important actors in a global scenario that calls for the increasing use of sustainable agricultural and environmental strategies (Box 2).In this Review, we explore the biological diversity of mycorrhizas, which have historically been grouped according to their morphological features (Box 1), through the identification of unique and common traits between types.

        <p>Due to their importance in ancient and extant ecosystems, the evolution of mycorrhizas has been explored in several reviews on the basis of data from palaeontology, genomic and phylogenomic studies, as well as plant and fungal diversity 6,14,15 , with the final aim to decipher the origin of their pervasive ecological success.Due to their importance in ancient and extant ecosystems, the evolution of mycorrhizas has been explored in several reviews on the basis of data from palaeontology, genomic and phylogenomic studies, as well as plant and fungal diversity 6,14,15 , with the final aim to decipher the origin of their pervasive ecological success.</p>
        <p>The earliest fossil evidence of plant-fungus associations is in the 407 million year old Rhynie chert , where rhizomes of extinct plants like Aglaophyton majus hosted arbuscule-like structures. These structures are similar to the AM observed in extant plant roots 16 (Box 1), suggesting that the AM symbiosis has played a role in land colonization by the earliest plants. Liverworts are the earliest diverging group among living plants and the occurrence of AMs in extant species (Fig. 2) supports this hypothesis, even though mycorrhizal fossils of these non-vascular plants have not been found. Rhynie chert specimens suggest that AM fungi assigned to the subphylum Glomeromycotina 17 were not alone in colonizing the first land plants, as additional intracellular fungi morphologically similar to extant Mucoromycotina have been found 18 . Indeed, phylogenomic evidence places the origin of both Mucoromycotina and Glomeromycotina (AM fungi) in the mid-late Silurian, ~420 million years ago (MYA) 17,19,20,21 .The earliest fossil evidence of plant-fungus associations is in the 407 million year old Rhynie chert , where rhizomes of extinct plants like Aglaophyton majus hosted arbuscule-like structures.

        <p>Even though the origin of ECM (Fig. 1 and Box 1) likely correlates with the appearance of Pinaceae (gymnosperms ), between 170 and 270 MYA 14 , ECM fossils are more recent and date back to 52 MYA, in the early Eocene 22 . The Gnepine hypothesis suggests that Gnetales are a sister group of Pinaceae 23 , and it is interesting that members of the genus Gnetum also bear ECM. However, other Gnetales (Welwitschia and Ephedra genera) are AM plants, as well as the remaining gymnosperms, including the 'living fossil' Ginkgo biloba. These data indicate that only some gymnosperms lost their primal AM status to embrace ECM, possibly under the pressure of environmental constraints. In general terms, the dominance of AM symbiosis in angiosperms mirrors the ecological success of this lineage since its evolutionary burst ~140-180 MYA. Major exceptions are represented by Orchidaceae and Ericaceae, two families that developed different mycorrhizal interactions. Convincing fossils of ORM are currently not available (Box 3), but their appearance must follow the late Cretaceous origin (76-84 MYA) of this family 24 . ERM developed in the Ericaceae from AM ancestors 25 and their most ancient fossils, belonging to the extant genus Leucothoe, date from 66-72 MYA 14 .Even though the origin of ECM (Fig. 1 and Box 1) likely correlates with the appearance of Pinaceae (gymnosperms ), between 170 and 270 MYA 14 , ECM fossils are more recent and date back to 52 MYA, in the early Eocene 22 .

        <p>Despite the discontinuity of the fossil record, mycorrhizal interactions likely evolved in non-vascular ancestors of extant plants with the instrumental role of favoring plant nutrient acquisition from the harsh primeval soils. In this regard, the limited occurrence of mycorrhizal interactions in extant early diverging plants (Bryophytes) appears puzzling. Mycorrhizas are in fact absent in mosses (including the model species Physcomitrella patens) and are found rather erratically in hornworts 6 and liverworts (Fig. 2), where the congeneric Marchantia paleacea and M. polymorpha are mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal, respectively 26 . A recent survey revealed that less than 30% of the examined liverworts engage associations with symbiotic fungi and those with Glomeromycotina are particularly few 27 . However, a limited number of species have been examined so far. Similarly, AM fungi are not dominant among early-diverging tracheophytes like ferns and club mosses 6,28 . A clue to this conundrum may come from the observation that photosynthesis and growth promotion in AM liverworts are enhanced under high CO 2 conditions 29 , resembling those of the Paleozoic atmosphere. It is therefore tempting to speculate that the progressive reduction in atmospheric CO 2 concentration during more recent geological eras eroded the usefulness of AM in some of these early diverging plants.Despite the discontinuity of the fossil record, mycorrhizal interactions likely evolved in non-vascular ancestors of extant plants with the instrumental role of favoring plant nutrient acquisition from the harsh primeval soils.

        <p>Biosphere evolution can therefore be added to some more obvious ecological considerations: in particular, bryophytes live in very humid environments and in close contact with the wet soil surface, possibly reducing the need for AM fungi as suppliers of water and minerals. On the other hand, the preference of seed plants (gymnosperms and angiosperms ) for AM may reflect the positive impact of mycorrhizal symbiosis on seed quality. In fact, studies on crop plants such as maize and wheat have demonstrated that mycorrhizal plants have larger seeds with a higher nutritional content 30,31 . This observation alone suggests a direct transgenerational effect with obvious implications in the success of mycorrhizal seed plants 32,33 .Biosphere evolution can therefore be added to some more obvious ecological considerations: in particular, bryophytes live in very humid environments and in close contact with the wet soil surface, possibly reducing the need for AM fungi as suppliers of water and minerals.

        <p>Mycorrhizal fungi are highly diverse in terms of their evolutionary history. However, genome sequencing of a substantial number of fungal species (see the fungal genomic resource MycoCosm ()) suggests that mechanisms of convergent evolution may have shaped their genomes. The most notable trait shared by all mycorrhizal fungi is the expansion of small secreted protein families that may act as effectors (Fig. 3) to manipulate host responses and to facilitate mutualistic interactions 34 .Mycorrhizal fungi are highly diverse in terms of their evolutionary history.

        <p>However, this genomic feature is also found in other plant-interacting microorganisms, like plant pathogens, where effector functions have been extensively characterized 35,36 . In addition, a limited complement of plant cell wall degrading carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) characterizes the evolutionarily oldest AM and ECM fungi 34,37 . In saprotrophic fungi , plant cell wall degrading enzymes are instrumental for the degradation of the organic soil litter. Whereas no data exists to support the origin of AM fungi from saprotrophic CAZyme-equipped ancestors, phylogenomic reconstructions clearly show that Basidiomycota ECM fungi evolved independently from saprotrophs, mainly wood decaying white and brown rot fungi, that possessed genes for lignin and/or cellulose degradation 38,39 . In most cases, the ECM lifestyle favored the loss of genes involved in the of lignocellulose and phenolic compounds present in soil organic matter 40 . However, the degree to which individual ECM species have maintained saprotrophy-related genes differs among lineages 37 , likely reflecting their evolutionary history and specific ecological functions, such as the ability to provide host plants with organic matter-derived nitrogen 41 . Genome sequencing of Pezizomycotina ECM, such as the widespread Cenoccoccum geophilum 42 and several truffles belonging to the Tuberaceae 43 , also revealed a reduction in lignocellulose-degrading enzymes in Ascomycota.However, this genomic feature is also found in other plant-interacting microorganisms, like plant pathogens, where effector functions have been extensively characterized 35,36 .

        <p>Irrespective of their evolutionary history, the small complement of CAZymes in AM and ECM suggests that fungal colonization of plant tissues may be largely modulated by the host plant, according to its nutritional needs and physiological status. Notably, the poor ability of fungi to degrade plant cell wall polysaccharides would also limit the release of degradation by-products, which are potent elicitors of plant defence 44 .Irrespective of their evolutionary history, the small complement of CAZymes in AM and ECM suggests that fungal colonization of plant tissues may be largely modulated by the host plant, according to its nutritional needs and physiological status.

        <p>In contrast with such apparently similar evolutionary trends in AM and ECM (Fig. 2), a surprisingly large set of cell wall degrading enzymes was found in the genomes of ORM and ERM fungi 37 . Their occurrence in ORM fungi like the Agaricomycetes Serendipita vermifera (order Sebacinales) and Tulasnella calospora (order Cantharellales) aligns with the role of these fungi in plant nutrition. In the early stages of their development, orchids are heterotrophic and ORM fungi feed them with carbohydrates likely extracted from soil organic matter 1 . Beside polysaccharidedegrading enzymes, the genomes of ERM Ascomycetes Oidiodendron maius and Rhizoscyphus ericae also contain numerous lipases, proteases and secondary metabolism enzymes, much like saprotrophs and non-mycorrhizal fungal endophytes 45,46 . Overall, the genomic features of phylogenetically distant ORM and ERM fungi, where a large suite of small secreted proteins (likely involved in their interactions with hosts) associate with an array of cell wall degrading enzymes (Fig. 3), mirror their dual biotrophic and saprotrophic capabilities. This may be the result of an evolutionary incomplete transition from the saprotrophic to the mycorrhizal habit 34,37 , likely due to the recent origin of these symbioses, both found exclusively in angiosperm taxa. However, some ECM lineages also originated quite recently but underwent a strong reduction in CAZymes. For example, molecular data indicate that ECM fungal lineages in the Laccaria genus have diversified from saprotrophic ancestors ~56-66 MYA 48 , whereas phylogenomics placed the origin of ERM fungi ~118 MYA, about the same time proposed for the origin of the family Ericaceae 45 . A more intriguing hypothesis to explain the genomic features of ERM and ORM fungi, in contrast to those of AM and ECM fungi, derives from the observation that specialization to narrow ecological niches commonly leads to gene loss 49 . Thus, one could hypothesize that AM (and to a lesser degree ECM) fungi evolved as exclusive mycorrhizal symbionts with the loss of specific genes, whereas ERM and ORM fungi retained a much broader ecological niche 4,47 , which allows them to switch between saprotrophic (in soil), mycorrhizal (in roots) and even pathogenic strategies 46 .In contrast with such apparently similar evolutionary trends in AM and ECM (Fig. 2), a surprisingly large set of cell wall degrading enzymes was found in the genomes of ORM and ERM fungi 37 .

        <p>Genome sequencing of AM fungi has provided clues to explain their peculiar status of obligate biotrophs and several of their characteristic functional traits. Different AM fungal species feature an overall comparable number of genes spread over very large genomes rich in transposable elements, ranging from 125 Mb in Rhizophagus irregularis to 770 Mb in Gigaspora margarita 50,51 . Phosphate uptake was established as the most iconic feature of AM fungi since the earliest studies on symbiosis functioning 52 , but only the recent sequencing of the G. margarita genome has revealed an expansion of phosphate metabolism-related genes, supporting the key role of these fungi as biofertilizers 51 . Some genome erosion has also occurred and all sequenced AM fungi lack a few basic metabolic processes, such as fatty acid and thiamine (also known as vitamin B 1 ) biosynthesis. The absence of fatty acid synthase 53 inspired the recent discovery that AM fungi -characterized by the extensive accumulation of reserve lipids -are fatty acid auxotrophs and rely on lipids received from the host plant 54,55 . Although tracing back the ancestors of AM fungi is not an easy task, Glomeromycotina cluster with the lipid-rich but predominantly saprotrophic Mortierellomycotina and Mucoromycotina 17,21 . Crucial information on a potential saprotrophic origin will come from genome sequencing of the earliest diverging taxa of Glomeromycotina, including Geosyphon pyriforme, a non-AM fungus that associates with photosynthetic cyanobacteria 56 .Genome sequencing of AM fungi has provided clues to explain their peculiar status of obligate biotrophs and several of their characteristic functional traits.

        <p>Studies focused on AM plants have revealed that a core set of genes is necessary to establish symbiosis 57 and that this plant symbiotic 'toolkit' is conserved across plant taxa 58,59 . This genetic signature includes members of the so-called common symbiotic signaling pathway (CSSP), namely SYMRK, CCaMK and CYCLOPS, that are conserved in all AM host species 59,60,61 and are also required for the establishment of symbiotic nitrogen fixation in legumes 57 and actinorhizal plants 62 . Unexpectedly, a few of these genes occur in charophytes, the closest living algal relatives of land plant ancestors 58 . The absence of known mycorrhizal-like interactions in algae opens several intriguing questions about the function of 'symbiotic' genes in charophytes and the process by which this set of genes has been exapted for new functions in early plants 58 . This symbiotic toolkit also includes transcription factors that coordinate the expression of a set of downstream plant genes involved in specific symbiotic functions, such as phosphate transport and lipid synthesis and transport 59 .Studies focused on AM plants have revealed that a core set of genes is necessary to establish symbiosis 57 and that this plant symbiotic 'toolkit' is conserved across plant taxa 58,59 .

        <p>The fungal symbiotic toolkit appears to have followed a different evolutionary trajectory. Transcriptomic analyses in ECM revealed that many fungal symbiotic genes, that is those up-regulated in mycorrhizal roots, are restricted to a single fungal species 37 . Indeed, the majority of symbiosis-induced genes do not have homologs between Laccaria amethystina and L. bicolor, that diverged only around 20 MYA. Also, the comparison across AM species of expressed candidate secreted proteins, expected to play a key role in plant-fungus interactions 35,36 , revealed the prevalence of lineage-specific proteins 64 . Remarkably, the expression of some of these secreted proteins can even differ within the same AM species, depending on the host plant 64 . Genomics data also point to large differences in the gene repertoire of closely related AM fungal species 50,51 . Although the majority of these genes has not been characterized, these observations indicate that lineage-specific genes with possible roles in symbiosis have evolved several times in the genome of mycorrhizal fungi, even over a relatively short evolutionary timescale 37,51,64 . Consequently, distinctive features of symbiotic fungi are not limited to the convergent loss of CAzymes -at least for AM and ECM -but also include the evolution of lineagespecific functional innovations.The fungal symbiotic toolkit appears to have followed a different evolutionary trajectory.

        <p>In addition to the necessary genetic toolkits, symbiotic partners need to sense each other in the soil, and signal exchange is an essential step in the development of mycorrhizal symbioses. Such presymbiotic chemical dialogue has been studied more deeply in AM, where a number of molecules have been characterized as reciprocally active symbiotic signals 65 . Host plant roots actively exude strigolactones 66,67 , a class of apocarotenoids that are sensed by AM fungi and promote spore germination , hyphal branching, nuclear divisions and respiratory metabolism 68,69 .

        <p>Our knowledge of presymbiotic signaling in other mycorrhizal interactions remains limited. Molecules acting as presymbiotic signals have not been identified in ERM and ORM, but the key genetic components of the plant CSSP have been identified through homology searches in the genome of some orchid species 81,82 and in the root transcriptome of the ERM species Rhododendron fortunei 59 . These findings, together with the ability of the CCaMK gene of the orchid Bletilla striata to restore both AM and nodule formation in a CCaMK-defective Lotus japonicus mutant 81 , suggest a wide conservation of the CSSP across plants forming different mycorrhizal types. Interestingly, some genes involved in early signaling, including key genes for strigolactone biosynthesis and secretion, are present in multiple copies in the genome of Gastrodia elata, a non-photosynthetic orchid that strictly depends on its ORM fungus for nutrients 82 .

        <p>Molecules acting as ECM presymbiotic signals have been recently identified 83 in the ECM fungus L. bicolor, which releases a cocktail of LCOs able to activate the CSSP in poplar roots. However, CSSP conservation in poplar is likely related to its ability to also host AM fungi. Indeed, a comparative analysis of over 120 plant genomes and 270 transcriptomes 59 demonstrated that a broad set of genes (not limited to CSSP members) is conserved in all plant lineages hosting intracellular symbiontsincluding AM, ORM, ERM as well as nitrogen fixing symbioses -but has been lost several times during the evolution of lineages hosting extracellular symbionts (including ECM and cyanobacterial associations) or those that are plainly nonsymbiotic (Fig. 3).Molecules acting as ECM presymbiotic signals have been recently identified 83 in the ECM fungus L. bicolor, which releases a cocktail of LCOs able to activate the CSSP in poplar roots.

        <p>In conclusion, the CSSP is emerging as a key pathway regulating all endomycorrhizal interactions. A few observations suggest a more general role, at least for individual CSSP members. In particular, L. japonicus CCamK and SymRK, or their orthologs in other species, were found to play a role in plant responses to beneficial microorganisms 84 , nematodes 85 , parasitic plants 86 , fungal endophytes 87 , pathogenic fungi 88 and thigmotropic stimuli 85,89 . These observations point to additional roles for individual CSSP members, in agreement with their presence in the genomes of charophytes, where their function has unfortunately not been characterized 20,58 .In conclusion, the CSSP is emerging as a key pathway regulating all endomycorrhizal interactions.

        <p>Following reciprocal signaling and recognition, the sub-apical region of young lateral roots is the most common site of plant-fungus contacts 8 . The broad developmental plasticity and responsiveness of this area may be a major requirement for symbiont accommodation.

        <p>Intriguingly, AM fungi are the only known fungal symbionts to develop a specialized adhesion structure -the hyphopodium 90 . This broad and often branched expansion of the hyphal tip represents a substantial resource investment by the fungus and generates a large contact surface with epidermal cells. Its development may be related to the inability of AM fungi to actively pierce the plant cell wall enzymatically and the consequent need to elicit accommodation responses in the host (including prepenetration apparatus assembly and local cell wall loosening under the hyphopodium). In fact, epidermal cell penetration occurs several hours after the partner contact 91 , in contrast with the direct penetration of epidermal cell walls by both ERM and ORM, both of which express numerous plant cell wall degrading enzymes during interaction with the plant 37,45 .Intriguingly, AM fungi are the only known fungal symbionts to develop a specialized adhesion structure -the hyphopodium 90 .

        <p>In ECM, extensive hyphal proliferation between and beneath epidermal cells is associated with a weakening of plant cell wall cohesion. Fungal colonization of the resulting apoplastic space is believed to depend on the chemical degradation of middle lamella pectins, combined with mechanical forces developed by hyphal tip growth 34,92 . Notably, in L. bicolor this process was recently shown to be enhanced by a symbiosis-induced endoglucanase (LbGH5-CBM1) 93 .In ECM, extensive hyphal proliferation between and beneath epidermal cells is associated with a weakening of plant cell wall cohesion.

        <p>In all cases, a substantial amount of fungal mycelium, either intercellular, as in ECM, or in the very lumen of individual plant cells, as in AM, ERM and ORM, is accommodated within the host tissues. This implies a massive reprogramming of plant development in coordination with fungal growth. In the case of ECM, this reprogramming primarily involves root meristems , which initially generate a novel pattern of recursive dichotomous branching and eventually stop their activity as the fungal mantle envelops them 34 . Alterations of root auxin signaling by the colonizing ECM fungus have been proposed to play a major role in these developmental processes, even if a consistent model is still missing 94 . Extensive root branching has been observed in both ERM and AM since the earliest interaction with the symbiotic fungi. However, the most striking developmental changes characterizing all endomycorrhizal interactions (AM, ERM and ORM) take place inside the colonized cells, with the appearance of de novo assembled cell compartments containing cell wall components that are lined by the host cell membrane (Box 1).In all cases, a substantial amount of fungal mycelium, either intercellular, as in ECM, or in the very lumen of individual plant cells, as in AM, ERM and ORM, is accommodated within the host tissues.

        <p>A common feature emerging from this scenario is that symbiotic fungal hyphae never have direct access to the host cell cytoplasm and they are confined to the apoplastic space within diverse symbiotic interfaces. These interfaces are also the main sites of nutrient exchange, thus representing the functional core of all mycorrhizal symbioses. In AM, the generation of a symbiotic interface seems to be dependent on CSSP signaling 78,95 , in striking analogy with other plant symbioses, such as symbiotic nitrogen fixation and actinorrhizas 62 . The numerous structural similarities observed among AM, ERM and ORM, as well as the induction of many homologs of AM-induced genes in ORM 81,96,97 , hint at the possible use of similar signaling and developmental processes across endomycorrhizal interactions.A common feature emerging from this scenario is that symbiotic fungal hyphae never have direct access to the host cell cytoplasm and they are confined to the apoplastic space within diverse symbiotic interfaces.

        <p>Since the first transcriptomic studies of both AM and ECM, particular interest was raised by genes involved in plant defence. Cell wall components of mycorrhizal fungi can indeed be perceived by the host plants as microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) and elicit plant immune responses 107 . The transient activation of such defence responses during early AM formation has been detected in several studies 108,109,110,111 . This activation has been explained as a form of plant priming 112 that contributes to the so-called mycorrhiza-induced resistance (MIR) and leads to higher resistance of AM plants to biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens, nematodes, insects and viruses 31,113,114,115 .Since the first transcriptomic studies of both AM and ECM, particular interest was raised by genes involved in plant defence.

        <p>Among MAMPs, chitin-related molecules have a pivotal role as elicitors of the plant response . Even if the picture is far from clear, such chitin-based signals have been shown to trigger different plant responses depending on the length of their chitinous backbone. Short-chain chitin oligomers (tetra-and pentamers) are potent elicitors of the CSSP in all AM hosts tested so far 70,71,72 -a function that in legumes is also played by chitin oligomer derivatives bearing lateral substitutions such as sulphate groups and a lipid tail 64,52 . By contrast, longer molecules (such as chito-octamers) activate pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) 107 , mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, reactive oxygen species release and defence gene expression 116,117 .

        <p>Early plant responses to ECM fungi also involve nonspecific, broad-spectrum defences, including increased chitinase and peroxidase activities during hyphal penetration into the apoplastic space of the root cortex. This pattern is attenuated in mature ECM 105,122,123, .

A few of these effectors have been demonstrated to enter the host cell and interfere with gene regulation.

Strikingly, some of these molecular tools (such as MAMPs and effectors) and processes (pattern-and effector-triggered immunity) are also fundamental during pathogenic interactions. The current challenge is to decipher the regulatory networks that discriminate between plant responses activated upon pathogen attacks from those allowing the establishment of a long-lasting beneficial interaction with mutualistic symbionts.

        <p>Notwithstanding the individual evolutionary history of each plant taxon, the mycorrhizal status seems to stem from common genetic bases already present in the common ancestor of land plants. The coevolution of land plants with AM fungi was revealed by fossil reports and is acknowledged as a dogma among plant biologists, but plant-fungal coevolution can also be hypothesized for the other more recent mycorrhizal types. Thanks to a number of independent evolutionary events, a few gymnosperm and angiosperm taxa, such as Pinaceae (170-270 MYA) and rosids (100-109 MYA), started to establish ECM interactions with fungi that had lost ancient saprotrophic strategies -including lignin decaying capabilities -in order to grant cell viability to their hosts 4 . Plant-fungus coevolution in ORM has likely been shaped by the peculiar nutritional strategies of orchids. In fact, ORM fungi ensure the ecological success of members of this large plant family by feeding them with organic carbon during early plant development, if not along the whole life cycle of the numerous achlorophyllous species 133 . Although ERM plants interact with a relatively small number of fungal taxa, a possible coevolution in this symbiosis is less clear because of the broad ecological niche of most fungal partners.Notwithstanding the individual evolutionary history of each plant taxon, the mycorrhizal status seems to stem from common genetic bases already present in the common ancestor of land plants.

        <p>Although mycorrhizal interactions occur in the roots of higher plants, their benefits extend to the whole individual, and even to its progeny, through the impact of symbiosis on seed production and quality. Such systemic effects are at the basis of the well-known 'growth effect' described in mycorrhizal interactions: the characterization of plant mechanisms underlying such systemic effects, such as phytohormone, miRNAs or peptide based signalling 135 for all mycorrhizal types is a crucial challenge for future research in this field. We envisage that the growing number of studies based on big data, implementation of models and correlation networks, are bound to provide new clues and lead the way to new research avenues addressing the biological and ecological complexity of mycorrhizal interactions and novel strategies for agricultural applications in a changing environment.Although mycorrhizal interactions occur in the roots of higher plants, their benefits extend to the whole individual, and even to its progeny, through the impact of symbiosis on seed production and quality.

        <p>The majority of mycorrhizal interactions belong to the four types illustrated in the scheme, which are also the most studied. In arbuscular mycorrhiza, hyphae originating from soil germinating spores contact the epidermal cell of host lateral roots through a flattened, often branched structure called the hyphopodium 79,90 . The hyphopodium and epidermal cell walls attach in an unclear process of softening and interweaving 137 . Penetrating hyphae then develop, cross the outer root cell layers with diverse colonization patterns that include the formation of loose intracellular coils and branched hyphae, and finally reach inner cortical cells, where they originate tree-like arbuscules 138 . Intracellular hyphae and arbuscules are always separated from the plant cell cytoplasm by an apoplastic interface surrounded by a perifungal membrane, a specialized extension of the host plasma membrane (in green) . The periarbuscular interface is believed to be the main site of nutrient exchange 139 , possibly facilitated by tubular expansions increasing the exchange surface 140,141 .The majority of mycorrhizal interactions belong to the four types illustrated in the scheme, which are also the most studied.

        <p>In ericoid mycorrhiza, hyphae penetrate the thick epidermal cell walls of Ericaceae roots without the development of apparent adhesion structures.

        <p>In ectomycorrhiza, sub-apical epidermal cells of emerging lateral roots are targeted by soil-borne hyphae. Their proliferation generates a pseudoparenchymatous tissue known as the sheathing mantle, engulfing the whole root tip 8 .

Such intraradical hyphae never penetrate the cell lumen, and the so-called Hartig net forms an intercellular interface (green).In ectomycorrhiza, sub-apical epidermal cells of emerging lateral roots are targeted by soil-borne hyphae.

        <p>The urgent demand for food safety and low-impact, sustainable agricultural practices offers a broad field of application for mycorrhizal interactions. In this respect, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi have the strongest potential, owing to their ability to colonize the majority of crop plants, and their positive effects on plant productivity 31,[155][156][157][158][159][160] and crop quality 161,162,163 . However, results on the benefits provided by AM fungi to host plants obtained in greenhouses may not directly be applicable in the field. As commented on in a recent field meta-analysis study 164 , a benefit in terms of increased yield is not often evident, especially when cereals are considered. It is also worth noting that AM fungi may also contribute to ecosystem functions such as soil aggregation 165 and reduced nutrient losses 166 . In addition, the reduced need for fertilizers directly influences the profitability and environmental impact of AM-based agricultural practices, even in the absence of a net yield increase. As previously advocated 167 , new production systems must be developed where the benefits for the host plant and the ecosystem services provided by mycorrhizal symbionts and other beneficial microorganisms are maximized to support sustainable agriculture 142,168. In the face of this great potential, the application of AM fungi in agroecosystems poses some technical challenges. Firstly, environmental variables can substantially impact the beneficial effects of AM 169 . Secondly, obligate biotrophy of AM fungi has been a major limitation to large scale inoculum production. Feeding AM fungi with lipids 170,171 opens new opportunities for massive in vitro production of pure inocula.The urgent demand for food safety and low-impact, sustainable agricultural practices offers a broad field of application for mycorrhizal interactions.

        <p>Lastly, the role of beneficial plant-fungus interactions has been overlooked for centuries by plant breeders, leading to crop varieties that have a high performance in fertilized soils, but are not particularly prone to AM colonization 172 . A novel approach has recently been proposed, based on the demonstration that plant treatments with exogenous Myc-factors (such as short-chain chitooligosaccharides ) promote AM establishment 173 . Field treatments with such AM fungal signals could facilitate root colonization by both native and inoculated AM fungi.Lastly, the role of beneficial plant-fungus interactions has been overlooked for centuries by plant breeders, leading to crop varieties that have a high performance in fertilized soils, but are not particularly prone to AM colonization 172 .
