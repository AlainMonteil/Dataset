        <p>CRP is a plasma protein produced by the liver and induced by various inflammatory mediators such as IL-6. Despite being non-specific, this acute phase reactant is used clinically as a biomarker for various inflammatory conditions; a rise in CRP levels are associated with an increase in disease severity [7].CRP is a plasma protein produced by the liver and induced by various inflammatory mediators such as IL-6.

        <p>The application of CRP in COVID-19 has been highlighted by a retrospective single-centre study in Wuhan, China, where the majority of patients in the severe cohort showed significantly higher levels compared to the non-severe cohort (57.9 mg/L vs 33.2 mg/L, P &lt; 0.001) [8]. A second retrospective cohort study found the likelihood of progressing to severe COVID-19 disease increased in patients with CRP levels &gt; 41.8 mg/L [9]. Both studies suggest CRP levels are a strong indicator to reflect the presence and severity of COVID-19 infection.The application of CRP in COVID-19 has been highlighted by a retrospective single-centre study in Wuhan, China, where the majority of patients in the severe cohort showed significantly higher levels compared to the non-severe cohort (57.9 mg/L vs 33.2 mg/L, P &lt; 0.001) [8].

        <p>Furthermore, a study from unpublished observations suggests CRP is one of the first biomarkers within blood plasma that changes to reflect physiological complications; if accepted CRP will be the most effective biomarker to predict the progression of COVID-19 infection. Contrastingly, the same study illustrated some cases of infection which showed changes in serum amyloid A (SAA) instead of evoking significant CRP changes thus requiring further evaluation [10].Furthermore, a study from unpublished observations suggests CRP is one of the first biomarkers within blood plasma that changes to reflect physiological complications; if accepted CRP will be the most effective biomarker to predict the progression of COVID-19 infection.

        <p>Whilst the use of SAA as a biomarker for COVID-19 requires further research, CRP and SAA are commonly used in conjunction to monitor inflammatory diseases.

        <p>Pathologically, computed tomography (CT) scans can identify lung lesions relating to COVID-19. Nonetheless, a study conducted in China revealed CT scores could not differentiate mild cases from severe. However, compared to erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), CRP levels were significantly greater during early periods of severe cases and proved to be a more sensitive biomarker in reflecting disease development [12].Pathologically, computed tomography (CT) scans can identify lung lesions relating to COVID-19.

        <p>The excellent performance of CRP as a biomarker is reflected in the 'area under curve' in the receiver operating analysis of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.10-1.00) where values 83% and 91% represent sensitivity and specificity, respectively. Hence compared to CT scans alone, CRP values are more reliable for earlier identification of case severity [12].

        <p>Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is an over-exaggerated immune response involving an overwhelming release of pro-inflammatory mediators. This mechanism underlies several pathological processes including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [13]. Studies investigating the role of cytokines in SARS and MERS have had also found a link between CRS and disease severity [14]. Understanding their role in COVID-19 disease may help facilitate the design of novel immunotherapies.Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is an over-exaggerated immune response involving an overwhelming release of pro-inflammatory mediators.

        <p>Studies have revealed that levels of IL-6, the most common type of cytokine released by activated macrophages, rise sharply in severe manifestations of COVID-19 [15].

        <p>One meta-analysis reviewing six studies show mean IL-6 concentrations were 2.9-fold higher in patients with complicated COVID-19 compared to those with non-complicated disease (n = 1302; 95% CI 1.17-7.19) [16]. In its analysis, the outcomes of the studies include ICU admission, onset of ARDS and mortality. Since the proportionate rise of IL-6 is correlated with disease severity, this study can prove groundbreaking. Although clinicians can use this to identify severity earlier and commence oxygen therapy sooner, the varying outcomes makes it somewhat difficult to ascertain what level of IL-6 corresponds to what negative outcome. Furthermore, many studies recruited participants from the same centre, giving rise to the potential of selection bias.

        <p>A retrospective study found several differences in WCC between severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients [8]. Both groups experienced an increase in leucocytes with the severe group having a significantly greater rise (5.6 vs 4.9 × 10 9 /L; P &lt; 0.001). NCs were predominantly driving this increase as the severe set (4.3 vs 3.2 × 10 9 /L; P &lt; 0.001). Interestingly, the levels of lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils and eosinophils were less, resulting in a greater neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR; 5.5 vs 3.2; P &lt; 0.001). NLR is an infamous biomarker, high in wide-spread inflammatory conditions and can be used to reflect disease severity.

        <p>Furthermore, Huang et al. found that levels of D-dimer on admission could be used to triage patients into critical care [5]. The researchers found that median D-dimer levels were higher in ICU patients compared to non-ICU patients (2.4 mg/L vs. 0.5 mg/L; p=0.0042). This, along with the previous study, suggests that D-dimer levels can be used as a prognostic marker and help clinicians monitor those who are likely to deteriorate earlier. However, this study confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19 using lower respiratory tract specimens and did not use paired nasopharyngeal swabs to investigate the viral RNA detection rate between the upper and lower respiratory tract specimens. Secondly, with a cohort size of 41 patients, it is difficult to assess predictors of disease severity and mortality with multivariable-adjusted methods.Furthermore, Huang et al. found that levels of D-dimer on admission could be used to triage patients into critical care [5].

        <p>Another study corroborates the previously documented work. The nadir platelet count was significantly associated with mortalityand the lower the nadir, the stronger the association [31]. Again, thrombocytopenia was more likely to occur in non-survivors than survivors. This study is from adequate sample sizes providing statistical power, however, similar to the previous studies, they are all retrospective making the correlation seen difficult to extrapolate from.Another study corroborates the previously documented work.

        <p>A retrospective study performed in China of patients with confirmed COVID-19 based on SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, revealed a univariable odds ratio for death at 80.1 (95% CI 10.3-620.4, p &lt; 0.0001) for hs-TnI [32]. This risk was higher compared to other biomarkers such as Ddimer and lymphocyte count. Another study of 416 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 reported that hs-TnI was elevated in 1 in 5 patients on presentation [33]. These patients were more likely to require invasive (22% vs 4%, p &lt; 0.001) or non-invasive (46% vs 4%, p &lt; 0.001) ventilation, develop ARDS (59% vs 15%, p &lt; 0.001) or acute kidney injury (9% vs 0%, p &lt; 0.001).A retrospective study performed in China of patients with confirmed COVID-19 based on SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, revealed a univariable odds ratio for death at 80.1 (95% CI 10.3-620.4, p &lt; 0.0001) for hs-TnI [32].

        <p>Early recognition of myocardial injury indicated by elevated hs-TnI aids in appropriate triage to a critical care area and informs the use of inotropes and vasopressors. However, elevated levels are common in hospitalised patients and are likely to be due to non-ischaemic causes of myocardial injury. This may lead to inappropriate use of cardiology consultation and downstream testing and increased risk to cardiac Table 4 Studies that compare WCC for COVID-19.Early recognition of myocardial injury indicated by elevated hs-TnI aids in appropriate triage to a critical care area and informs the use of inotropes and vasopressors.

        <p>A larger study of 701 patients revealed that elevated serum creatinine levels on admission correlated with severity due to significant abnormalities in the coagulation pathway [36]. They also found that these patients were more likely to require mechanical ventilation or be placed in intensive care. Univariate Cox regression analysis found elevated creatinine levels was also associated with in-hospital mortality (HR 2.99, 95% CI: 2.00, 4.47). Proteinuria, haematuria and elevated urea levels had similar, if not larger, hazard ratios.A larger study of 701 patients revealed that elevated serum creatinine levels on admission correlated with severity due to significant abnormalities in the coagulation pathway [36].

        <p>Interestingly, another study showed a potential role for urinalysis over serum markers of kidney function [37]. Here, abnormalities in the routine urine test on admission correlated strongly with disease severity. They go on to suggest that urinalysis may reveal kidney impairment more readily than evaluation of serum renal biomarkers. However, these tests were only carried out on admission and so patients in earlier stages of the infection had changes in serum levels obscured by compensatory kidney function. Hence renal abnormalities on admission may indicate higher risks of deterioration, ensuring appropriate triaging.Interestingly, another study showed a potential role for urinalysis over serum markers of kidney function [37].

        <p>Compared to other biomarkers, there is hesitancy in using WCC alone as it is influenced by many factors such as glucocorticoid treatment which increases it. Although WCC encompasses many cell types, NCs and LCs are most clinically relevant biomarkers. Multiple studies on COVID-19 have concurred high NLR in severe cases compared to non-severe cases due to high NC and low LC. The use of LC independently has been suggested as a potential biomarker of COVID-19 as patients have consistently low LC, with significant lymphopenia reported in critically ill patients [18,55]. Therefore, further research on WCC accuracy for assessing disease progression is necessary.Compared to other biomarkers, there is hesitancy in using WCC alone as it is influenced by many factors such as glucocorticoid treatment which increases it.

        <p>Although, most of the studies referenced in this review are single centred studies originating in Wuhan, China, the virus is now a global pandemic thus requiring international studies. As a copious amount of data was collected from the same location, it is possible patients may have been used in more than one study. Furthermore, categorising patients into severe and non-severe sub-groups is dependent on the definitions of severity of COVID-19. Two very different measures of severity used in some studies are ICU admission and onset of ARDS.Although, most of the studies referenced in this review are single centred studies originating in Wuhan, China, the virus is now a global pandemic thus requiring international studies.

Consequently, the sensitivity and specificity of biomarkers are useful indicators to the effectiveness, though not all studies discussed this.

        <p>Findings of these studies have discovered changes in biomarker levels and may potentially be useful in creating a therapeutic intervention. For instance, one study has reviewed the use of anticoagulation therapy in patients with coagulopathy or marked rise in D-dimers in the setting of COVID-19 [38]. Low molecular weight heparin was found to be associated with better prognosis in severe cases. To further asses the role of anti-coagulants as a treatment, we encourage large interventional trails to study this.Findings of these studies have discovered changes in biomarker levels and may potentially be useful in creating a therapeutic intervention.

        <p>In conclusion, the work to date suggests that there is clear evidence of how the levels of biomarkers may change according to severity of COVID-19 infection. This can be used as an adjunct in clinical practice to guide treatment and admission to ICU. By doing so, it may improve prognosis and minimise the mortality rates. However, being in the infant stages of understanding the pathology of this infectious disease, we urge for further research worldwide to better understand the changes noted in this review.In conclusion, the work to date suggests that there is clear evidence of how the levels of biomarkers may change according to severity of COVID-19 infection.
