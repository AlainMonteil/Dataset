        <p>The first confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the US was reported from Washington State on January 31, 2020. Soon after, Washington and California reported outbreaks, and cases in the US have now exceeded total cases reported in both Italy and China. The rate of infections in New York, with its high population density, has exceeded every other state, and, as of April 20, 2020, it has more than 30% of all of the US cases.The first confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the US was reported from Washington State on January 31, 2020.

        <p>Limited information has been available to describe the presenting characteristics and outcomes of US patients requiring hospitalization with this illness. In a retrospective cohort study from China, hospitalized patients were predominantly men with a median age of 56 years; 26% required intensive care unit (ICU) care, and there was a 28% mortality rate. However, there are significant differences between China and the US in population demographics, smoking rates, and prevalence of comorbidities.Limited information has been available to describe the presenting characteristics and outcomes of US patients requiring hospitalization with this illness.

        <p>The study was conducted at hospitals in Northwell Health, the largest academic health system in New York, serving approximately 11 million persons in Long Island, Westchester County, and New York City. The Northwell Health institutional review board approved this case series as minimal-risk research using data collected for routine clinical practice and waived the requirement for informed consent. All consecutive patients who were sufficiently medically ill to require hospital admission with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by positive result on polymerase chain reaction testing of a nasopharyngeal sample were included. Patients were admitted to any of 12 Northwell Health acute care hospitals between March 1, 2020, and April 4, 2020, inclusive of those dates. Clinical outcomes were monitored until April 4, 2020, the final date of follow-up. Data were collected from the enterprise electronic health record (Sunrise Clinical Manager; Allscripts) reporting database, and all analyses were performed using version 3
            <rs type="version">.5.2</rs> of the R programming language (
            <rs type="creator">R Project for Statistical Computing; R Foundation</rs>). Patients were considered to have confirmed infection if the initial test result was positive or if it was negative but repeat testing was positive. Repeat tests were performed on inpatients during hospitalization shortly after initial test results were available if there was a high clinical pretest probability of COVID-19 or if the initial negative test result had been judged likely to be a false-negative due to poor sample collection. Transfers from one in-system hospital to another were merged and considered as a single visit. There were no transfers into or out of the system. For patients with a readmission during the study period, data from the first admission are presented.
        </p>
        <p>Data collected included patient demographic information, comorbidities, home medications, triage vitals, initial laboratory tests, initial electrocardiogram results, diagnoses during the hospital course, inpatient medications, treatments (including invasive mechanical ventilation and kidney replacement therapy), and outcomes (including length of stay, discharge, readmission, and mortality). Demographics, baseline comorbidities, and presenting clinical studies were available for all admitted patients. All clinical outcomes are presented for patients who completed their hospital course at study end (discharged alive or dead). Clinical outcomes available for those in hospital at the study end point are presented, including invasive mechanical ventilation, ICU care, kidney replacement therapy, and length of stay in hospital.Data collected included patient demographic information, comorbidities, home medications, triage vitals, initial laboratory tests, initial electrocardiogram results, diagnoses during the hospital course, inpatient medications, treatments (including invasive mechanical ventilation and kidney replacement therapy), and outcomes (including length of stay, discharge, readmission, and mortality).

        <p>Outcomes such as discharge disposition and readmission were not available for patients in hospital at study end because they had not completed their hospital course. Home medications were reported based on the admission medication reconciliation by the inpatient-accepting physician because this is the most reliable record of home medications. Final reconciliation has been delayed until discharge during the current pandemic. Home medications are therefore presented only for patients who have completed their hospital course to ensure accuracy.Outcomes such as discharge disposition and readmission were not available for patients in hospital at study end because they had not completed their hospital course.

        <p>Race and ethnicity data were collected by self-report in prespecified fixed categories. These data were included as study variables to characterize admitted patients. Initial laboratory testing was defined as the first test results available, typically within 24 hours of admission. For initial laboratory testing and clinical studies for which not all patients had values, percentages of total patients with completed tests are shown. The Charlson Comorbidity Index predicts 10-year survival in patients with multiple comorbidities and was used as a measure of total comorbidity burden. The lowest score of 0 corresponds to a 98% estimated 10year survival rate. Increasing age in decades older than age 50 years and comorbidities, including congestive heart disease and cancer, increase the total score and decrease the estimated 10-year survival. A total of 16 comorbidities are included. A score of 7 points and above corresponds to a 0% estimated 10year survival rate. Acute kidney injury was identified as an increase in serum creatinine by 0.3 mg/dL or more (≥26.5 μmol/L) within 48 hours or an increase in serum creatinine to 1.5 times or more baseline within the prior 7 days compared with the preceding 1 year of data in acute care medical records. This was based on the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition. Acute hepatic injury was defined as an elevation in aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase of more than 15 times the upper limit of normal.Race and ethnicity data were collected by self-report in prespecified fixed categories.

        <p>A total of 5700 patients were included (median age, 63 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 52-75; range, 0-107 years]; 39.7% female) (Table 1). The median time to obtain polymerase chain reaction testing results was 15.4 hours (IQR, 7.8-24.3). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (3026, 56.6%), obesity (1737, 41.7%), and diabetes (1808, 33.8%). The median score on the Charlson Comorbidity Index was 4 points (IQR, 2-6), which corresponds to a 53% estimated 10-year survival and reflects a significant comorbidity burden for these patients. At triage, 1734 patients (30.7%) were febrile, 986 (17.3%) had a respiratory rate greater than 24 breaths/min, and 1584 (27.8%) received supplemental oxygen (Table 2 andTable 3). The first test for COVID-19 was positive in 5517 patients (96.8%), while 183 patients (3.2%) had ), the median follow-up at time of censoring was 4.5 days (IQR, 2.4-8.1). Mortality was 0% (0/20) for male and female patients younger than 20 years. Mortality rates were higher for male compared with female patients at every 10-year age interval older than 20 years.A total of 5700 patients were included (median age, 63 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 52-75; range, 0-107 years]; 39.7% female) (Table 1).

        <p>To our knowledge, this study represents the first large case series of sequentially hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the US. Older persons, men, and those with pre-existing hypertension and/or diabetes were highly prevalent in this case series and the pattern was similar to data reported from China. However, mortality rates in this case series were significantly lower, possibly due to differences in thresholds for hospitalization. This study reported mortality rates only for patients with definite outcomes (discharge or death), and longer-term study may find different mortality rates as different segments of the population are infected. The findings of high mortality rates among ventilated patients are similar to smaller case series reports of critically ill patients in the US.To our knowledge, this study represents the first large case series of sequentially hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the US.

        <p>ACEi and ARB medications can significantly increase mRNA expression of cardiac angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), leading to speculation about the possible adverse, protective, or biphasic effects of treatment with these medications. This is an important concern because these medications are the most prevalent antihypertensive medications among all drug classes. However, this case series design cannot address the complexity of this question, and the results are unadjusted for known confounders, including age, sex, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status indicators, and comorbidities such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure.ACEi and ARB medications can significantly increase mRNA expression of cardiac angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), leading to speculation about the possible adverse, protective, or biphasic effects of treatment with these medications.

        <p>Mortality rates are calculated only for patients who were discharged alive or died by the study end point. This biases our rates toward including more patients who died early in their hospital course. Most patients in this study were still in hospital at the study end point (3066, 53.8%). We expect that as these patients complete their hospital course, reported mortality rates will decline.Mortality rates are calculated only for patients who were discharged alive or died by the study end point.

        <p>This study has several limitations. First, the study population only included patients within the New York metropolitan area. Second, the data were collected from the electronic health record database. This precluded the level of detail possible with a manual medical record review. Third, the median postdischarge follow-up time was relatively brief at 4.4 days (IQR, 2.2-9.3). Fourth, subgroup descriptive statistics were unadjusted for potential confounders. Fifth, clinical outcome data were available for only 46.2% of admitted patients. The absence of data on patients who remained hospitalized at the final study date may have biased the findings, including the high mortality rate of patients who received mechanical ventilation older than age 65 years.This study has several limitations.

        <p>For simplicity, we present the number and percentage of test results that were above the upper limit of normal for the individual references ranges for these 3 tests. QTC resulted from the automated ECG reading. Acute kidney injury was identified as an increase in serum creatinine by ≥0.3 mg/dL (≥26.5 mol/L) within 48 hours or an increase in serum creatinine to ≥1.5 times baseline within the prior 7 days compared with the preceding 1 year of data in acute care medical records. Acute kidney injury is calculated only for patients with record of baseline kidney function data available and without a diagnosis of end-stage kidney disease.
