        <p>Oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) are associated with an increased risk of occurrence of cancers of the lip or oral cavity. This paper presents an updated report on the nomenclature and the classification of OPMDs, based predominantly on their clinical features, following discussions by an expert group at a workshop held by the World Health Organisation (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Oral Cancer in the UK. The first workshop held in London in 2005 considered a wide spectrum of disorders under the term 'potentially malignant disorders of the oral mucosa' (PMD) (now referred to as oral potentially malignant disorders: OPMD) including leukoplakia, erythroplakia, proliferative verrucous leukoplakia, oral lichen planus, oral submucous fibrosis, palatal lesions in reverse smokers, lupus erythematosus, epidermolysis bullosa and dyskeratosis congenita. Any new evidence published in the intervening period was considered to make essential changes to the 2007 classification. In the current update, most entities were retained with minor changes to their definition. There is sufficient evidence for an increased risk of oral cancer among patients diagnosed with "oral lichenoid lesions" and among those diagnosed with oral manifestations of chronic graft-versus-host disease. These have now been added to the list of OPMDs. There is, to date, insufficient evidence concerning the malignant potential of chronic hyperplastic candidosis and of oral exophytic verrucous hyperplasia to consider these conditions as OPMDs. Furthermore, due to lack of clear evidence of an OPMD in epidermolysis bullosa this was moved to the category with limited evidence.

        <p>In March 2020, the WHO Collaborating Centre for Oral Cancer in the UK convened a workshop attended by invited experts to discuss the advances in knowledge and recent changes in the understanding of oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs). OPMDs are a significant group of mucosal disorders that may precede the diagnosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) (Warnakulasuriya, Johnson, &amp; van der Waal, 2007). Since the introduction of this terminology, 'potentially malignant disorders of the oral mucosa' (PMD) (later OPMD), health care providers and researchers over the globe have enthusiastically adopted this term and the classification of entities therein, and this has resulted in better reporting of this important group of disorders. A recent review identified over 750 publications on the topic of OPMDs published since 2007 (Liu, Wu, Zhang, Shi, &amp; Yang, 2020). However, discrepancies in describing these disorders are still found in the published literature leading to inconsistency and a degree of confusion. The terminology for disorders that precede development of cancers has evolved over the years to align with greater scientific evidence and to reflect temporal advances in understanding of the natural history of these disorders. OPMDs refer to a group of lesions and conditions characterised by a variably increased risk of developing cancers of the lip (C00) and the oral cavity (C02-C06) (Warnakulasuriya et al., 2007). The terminology has been endorsed by the latest WHO classification on Head and Neck Tumours (Reibel, Gale, &amp; Hille, 2017).In March 2020, the WHO Collaborating Centre for Oral Cancer in the UK convened a workshop attended by invited experts to discuss the advances in knowledge and recent changes in the understanding of oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs).

        <p>The concept of 'pre-cancer' was introduced in 1805 when a European panel of physicians suggested that there are benign diseases that may develop into invasive malignancy if followed for a long time (Baillie, Simms, et al., 1806). The thinking behind the concept of OPMDs as reported by the 2005 workshop and re-affirmed by the Working Group (2020) is that OPMDs represent tissue "fields" with more or less distinctive clinical appearances at initial assessment, and where a proportion within each clinical category have been documented to have subsequently developed a cancer during follow-up; Viz: tissues within these categories have enhanced malignant potential. Some of these clinical alterations, red and white patches in particular, are seen to co-exist at the margins of overt OSCCs; they possess similar morphological and cytological changes observed inThe concept of 'pre-cancer' was introduced in 1805 when a European panel of physicians suggested that there are benign diseases that may develop into invasive malignancy if followed for a long time (Baillie, Simms, et al., 1806).

It is also important to recognise that OSCC can present without the patient or a clinician having been aware of a preceding clinically altered mucosa at the site. Thus, expert opinion at the 2005 workshop (published in 2007) proposed a shift from previously used terms "precancer", "epithelial precursor lesions", "premalignant", "precancerous", and "intraepithelial lesion" to OPMD. Lesions and conditions were combined into one category of "disorders", in recognition of the fact that field change usually exists due to exposure to environmental carcinogens across much of the upper aero-digestive tract, and that the whole person may have changes which influence the risk of cancer development (Johnson, 2017;2020).This article is protected by copyright.

        <p>Patients diagnosed with OPMDs may have an increased susceptibility to develop cancer anywhere in their mouth during their lifetime. The majority of these OPMDs may not progress to carcinoma, but rather they provide a field of abnormality in which cancer development is more likely than in their clinically normal mucosa, and more likely than in patients without such disorders. "Clinically normal mucosa" can by molecularly abnormal. As alluded to earlier, the cancer does not necessarily occur in the site of the visibly altered mucosa. An important challenge faced by clinicians managing patients with OPMDs is to be able to identify the small proportion of patients most likely to develop a future malignancy.Patients diagnosed with OPMDs may have an increased susceptibility to develop cancer anywhere in their mouth during their lifetime.

        <p>With these objectives in mind, inclusion of some additional disorders has been proposed (Warnakulasuriya, 2018;2020): oral lichenoid lesions and reactions, oral chronic graft-versus-host disease, chronic hyperplastic candidosis, and oral exophytic verrucous hyperplasia. We discuss the available evidence on these disorders in section 4 of this report. This paper lays out the updated classification, provides or endorses definitions of each disorder and highlights areas of uncertainty that warrant further investigation. The objective is to present a consensus on a revised classification of OPMDs, recommended nomenclature and definitions for each disorder. Such classification is predominantly, albeit not exclusively, based on clinical features.With these objectives in mind, inclusion of some additional disorders has been proposed (Warnakulasuriya, 2018;2020): oral lichenoid lesions and reactions, oral chronic graft-versus-host disease, chronic hyperplastic candidosis, and oral exophytic verrucous hyperplasia.

        <p>OPMDs have a wide range of clinical features including colour variations (white, red, and mixed white and red), topographic changes (plaque/plateau, smooth, corrugated, verrucous, granular, atrophic), and may be of variable size (Williams, Poh, Hovan, Ng, &amp; Rosin, 2008;Speight, Khurram, &amp; Kujan, 2018). Some OPMDs, particularly oral leukoplakia may superficially ulcerate due to abrasion of the surface by trauma from teeth or appliances.

        <p>The majority of patients with OPMDs are diagnosed in middle-aged or elderly patients, predominantly males (Napier &amp; Speight, 2008;Speight et al., 2018). In western populations, elderly females with long-standing leukoplakia and without obvious risk factors have, paradoxically, a significant risk of progression to cancer. These individuals could carry an endogenous risk factor, rather than being exposed to an environmental factor. Ethnicity and associated dominance of particular cultural risk factors have influenced the type and pattern of OPMDs reported in specific populations. For example, betel quid/areca nut chewing habits are widely prevalent in South Asian populations resulting in a greater prevalence of OPMDs (Lee et al., 2012a;Lee, et al., 2012b, Mello et al., 2018). Reverse smoking habit is also known to induce specific mucosal changes on the palate in some geographic regions (see section 3.7)The majority of patients with OPMDs are diagnosed in middle-aged or elderly patients, predominantly males (Napier &amp; Speight, 2008;Speight et al., 2018).

        <p>Leukoplakia is amongst the most common and most studied OPMD encountered in clinical practice and in population surveys. A bibliometric study of the most-cited articles on oral leukoplakia that provide a historical perspective on scientific evolution of our understanding of this disorder was published recently (Liu, Zhang, Wu, Yang, &amp; Shi, 2019). Historically, several definitions have been proposed for leukoplakia (Supplementary Table 1). The most recent definition by the WHO Collaborating Centre, published in 2007, was "A predominantly white plaque of questionable risk having excluded (other) known diseases or disorders that carry no increased risk for cancer" (Warnakulasuriya et al., 2007). The present Working Group found no reason to change this definition which is now being reported widely in the global literature.Leukoplakia is amongst the most common and most studied OPMD encountered in clinical practice and in population surveys.

        <p>It is emphasised that the term leukoplakia is used as a clinical diagnosis having excluded other clinically recognisable white or white/red lesions (Warnakulasuriya, 2019) (Table 2). The term "persistent" has been used under inclusion criteria but it must be noted that a history of persistence cannot always be ascertained at baseline. When the clinical features are clear it is not always important to definitively establish persistence. During clinical examination of a white patch it is important to first look for a local traumatic cause. If this is evident, the white patch should not be considered a leukoplakia, but rather be designated as a frictional keratosis. Frictional keratoses are typically diffuse and upon removal of the putative frictional source, they should resolve. It is important they are not regarded as an OPMD and must be distinguished from leukoplakia because the latter indicates a future cancer risk.It is emphasised that the term leukoplakia is used as a clinical diagnosis having excluded other clinically recognisable white or white/red lesions (Warnakulasuriya, 2019) (Table 2).

        <p>Leukoplakia can be sub-classified clinically into homogenous and non-homogenous types using distinct features based on colour and surface texture (Table 3). Homogenous leukoplakias are typically asymptomatic and present as a uniformly thin white plaque/patch. They have a smooth surface with a consistent surface topography throughout, are usually sharply demarcated and often exhibit shallow surface cracks/fissures.Leukoplakia can be sub-classified clinically into homogenous and non-homogenous types using distinct features based on colour and surface texture (Table 3).

        <p>The current expert group emphasises that at the time of baseline detection, oral leukoplakia is a provisional clinical diagnosis made by exclusion of other white disorders. A diagnostic biopsy is indicated to confirm this clinical diagnosis or modify it (ie. oral lichen planus, or hyperplastic candidosis). One or more underlying histopathologic diagnoses ranging from simple epithelial hyperplasia with hyperparakeratosis or hyper(ortho)keratosis, varying severity of epithelial dysplasia are consistent with oral leukoplakia (Reibel et al., 2017;Ranganathan and Loganathan, 2019). It is customary that the pathologist mentions whether the histology is compatible with the clinical diagnosis of leukoplakia or not, indicates the presence or absence of dysplasia and if present, provides the grade(s) of dysplasia. To achieve uniformity in reporting we recommend a pathology report to state "keratosis with no/mild/moderate/severe dysplasia, consistent with oral leukoplakia". A biopsy may on occasion demonstrate superficially invasive carcinoma, then the diagnosis of leukoplakia is revised to carcinoma. These pathological aspects of leukoplakia are presented in detail by Kujan et al., in this volume. Any field surveys that have not included a protocol for biopsy should clarify that the diagnosis was based on clinical features without histopathological confirmation Misdiagnosis and misclassification of leukoplakias have led to confusion and inaccurate reporting of prevalence (Auluck &amp; Pai, 2005), also thereby under-reporting malignant transformation inThe current expert group emphasises that at the time of baseline detection, oral leukoplakia is a provisional clinical diagnosis made by exclusion of other white disorders.

        <p> Tobacco pouch keratosis -this is a white patch found on the lower buccal grooves among smokeless tobacco users who retain their tobacco quid at the site (Müller, 2019). Most of them will resolve following discontinuation of the habit but those that persist should be included within the group leukoplakia. A biopsy is indicated at baseline and further study is needed to assess their natural history.  Sublingual keratosis-A white patch when found of the floor of the mouth or inferior surface of the tongue was termed sublingual keratosis by Kramer's group (Kramer, El-Labban, &amp; Lee, 1978a). The authors attributed high significance to these, having noted that a large proportion of their patients with such white patches developed squamous cell carcinomas in that area. Subsequent studies have not confirmed the extremely high risk of transformation noted in early studies, but the floor of mouth remains a high-risk site and leukoplakias at this site merit careful follow-up. The Working Group recommends that any white patch on floor of mouth -having excluded other known conditions -should be clinically considered a leukoplakia.  Sanguinaria-associated keratosis- Damm et al., (1999), Eversole et al., (2000) and Mascarenha et al., (2002) described a unique form of a white patch that could be attributed to the use of a dentifrice and/or mouthrinse containing the herbal additive sanguinaria. Tobacco pouch keratosis -this is a white patch found on the lower buccal grooves among smokeless tobacco users who retain their tobacco quid at the site (Müller, 2019).

        <p>This condition is defined as a distinct form of multifocal oral leukoplakia characterised by having a progressive clinical course, changing clinical and histopathologic features, and is associated with the highest proportion of oral cavity cancer development compared with other OPMDs (Cabay, Morton, &amp; Epstein, 2007;Iocca et al., 2019). Other terms proposed in the literature are Proliferative Multifocal Leukoplakia (Aguirre-Urizar et al., 2011) and Proliferative leukoplakia (Villa et al., 2018). From a clinical perspective, the evolution of this type of OPMD often begins as one or more leukoplakias, later presenting in multiple locations due to gradual spread of an individual focus or resulting from fusion over time of several adjacent foci (Villa et al., 2018). The original report by Hansen et al., (1985) coining the term Proliferative Verrucous Leukoplakia proposed that the diagnosis be made by a combination of clinical and histological features (Hansen, Olson, &amp; Silverman, 1985). Specific clinical diagnostic criteria were later proposed by Cerero-Lapiedra et al., (2010) and Carrard et al., (2013). Their criteria included the disorder affecting more than two different oral sites, and the existence of a verrucous area. Initial clinical presentation could be flat white lesions (without any verrucous component) (Batsakis, Suarez, &amp; El-Naggar, 1999;Villa et al., 2018), and may also sometimes have a lichenoid clinical appearance (Garcia-Pola et al ., 2016) and be signed out as being lichenoid by the pathologist. In the latter situation it is possible that a case could be erroneously treated as OLP for many years, with the risk of missing, or of accelerating, subsequent malignancy. Despite the imperfection of the term PVL to capture an expanded group of patients with multifocal disease, the term is widely reported, and the Working Group recommended retaining this term.This condition is defined as a distinct form of multifocal oral leukoplakia characterised by having a progressive clinical course, changing clinical and histopathologic features, and is associated with the highest proportion of oral cavity cancer development compared with other OPMDs (Cabay, Morton, &amp; Epstein, 2007;Iocca et al., 2019).

        <p>Erythroplakia is a solitary lesion defined (Table 1) as 'a predominantly fiery red patch that cannot be characterised clinically or pathologically as any other definable disease' Erythroplakia exhibits a clinical appearance of a sharply demarcated, flat or depressed, erythematous area of mucosa with a matt appearance. Inflammatory conditions that may result in a red clinical appearance are excluded prior to arriving at this diagnosis (see Table 3) (Kramer et al., 1978b;van der Waal &amp; Scully, 2011;Warnakulasuriya, 2019) The solitary presentation of erythroplakia helps to distinguish it from other more widespread conditions such as erosive lichen planus, lupus erythematosus and erythematous candidiasis which present more often in multiple sites (van der Waal, 2010). Other conditions include autoimmune disorders, infections, and vascular hamartomas/vascular neoplasms that may exhibit similar clinical features and should be considered in the differential diagnosis (Reichart &amp; Philipson, 2005). Most oral erythroplakias, at the time of diagnosis, are either histopathologically a squamous cell carcinoma or show high-grade epithelial dysplasia.Erythroplakia is a solitary lesion defined (Table 1) as 'a predominantly fiery red patch that cannot be characterised clinically or pathologically as any other definable disease' Erythroplakia exhibits a clinical appearance of a sharply demarcated, flat or depressed, erythematous area of mucosa with a matt appearance.

        <p>Oral submucous fibrosis is a well-recognised OPMD characterised by fibrosis of the oral mucosa (and submucosa) and there is a higher risk for oral cancer development in patients with OSF. In moderate to advanced cases fibrosis may also involve the oropharynx and the upper third of the oesophagus (Maher, Ahmed, Qureshi, Zuberi, &amp; Syed, 1991;Misra, Misra, Dwivedi, &amp; Gupta, 1998., Tilakaratne, Ekanayaka, &amp; Warnakulasuriya, 2016).

It is generally characterised by patients reporting a burning sensation of the oral mucosa and intolerance to spicy foods. Initial signs include a leathery mucosa, pallor, loss of tongue papillae, petechiae and occasionally vesicles. As the disease progresses fibrous bands develop in lips, cheek mucosa and soft palate and this hallmark feature leads to a limited mouth opening (Kerr et al., 2011). There is growing evidence to support the role of genetic susceptibility and family history in the pathogenesis and clinical presentation of OSF (Ray, Chatterjee, &amp; Chaudhuri, 2019). Several grading systems have been proposed. Based on objective criteria a 5-grade system was proposed by Kerr et al., (2011). The working group endorses this for clinical use. Carrozzo et al., (2019) characterised oral lichen planus (OLP) as a disease with bilateral white reticular patches affecting buccal mucosae, tongue, and gingivae. More severe presentations include erosions/areas of atrophy and ulceration. Despite being a common non-infectious disorder in the oral cavity (Roopashree et al., 2010), oral lichen planus (OLP) continues to be a disorder without clear causative factors (Krutchkoff, Cutler, &amp; Laskowski, 1978;van der Meij et al., 1999;Cheng, Gould, Kurago, Fantasia, &amp; Muller 2016;Aghbari et al., 2017). Cancer development in patients with a diagnosis of OLP was recently reviewed by Gonzalez-Moles et al., (2019). OLP should be diagnosed using both clinical and histopathological characteristics (Table 4) (van der Meij &amp; van der Waal, 2003;Al-Hashimi et al., 2007;Cheng et al., 2016), and should be clearly distinguished from disorders with similar clinical appearances but due to other causes including oral lichenoid lesions (van der Meij &amp; van der Waal, 2003), oral lichenoid drug reactions (Scully &amp; Bagan, 2004), oral lichenoid contact hypersensitivity reactions (Al-Hashimi et al., 2007), lichen planus pemphigoides, chronic ulcerative stomatitis, acute and chronic graft-versus host disease, lichen sclerosus, lupus erythematosus, and the early stages of PVL (Cheng et al., 2016;Carrozzo et al., 2019). When defining cancer development in patients with OLP authors should follow strict criteria in diagnosing OLP that incorporate clinical, histopathological and patient characteristics (Idrees, Kujan, Shearston, &amp; Farah, 2020).

        <p>Lupus erythematosus is a chronic auto-immune disease which can be principally subdivided into 3 forms: (1) systemic, (2) drug-induced, and (3) discoid. Oral lesions may manifest in approximately 20% patients with systemic lupus. Oral lesions of lupus erythematosus (OLE) exhibit similar clinical presentations as found in OLP. Typically, OLE presents as a central circular zone of atrophic mucosa, with superficial ulceration surrounded by whitish striae (Odell, 2017). Buccal mucosae, palate and lips are most commonly affected. Histopathologic criteria for the diagnosis of (discoid) lupus erythematosus are described by Schiødt, (1984). Carcinomas developing within lesions OLE are rare intra-orally, and most arise on the lips (Arvanitidou et al., 2018). It is not always possible to confidently distinguish OLP from OLE intra-orally, so that in the absence of systemic features it is quite possible that malignancy arising in LE would be misclassified as a malignancy arising in OLP.Lupus erythematosus is a chronic auto-immune disease which can be principally subdivided into 3 forms: (1) systemic, (2) drug-induced, and (3) discoid.

        <p>Dyskeratosis Congenita (DKC) (also called Zinsser-Cole-Engman syndrome), is a rare hereditary condition of dysfunctional telomere maintenance that is regarded as a potentially malignant disorder. A higher frequency of oral cancers is noted among patients affected by this condition (Bongiorno, Rivard, Hammer, &amp; Kentosh, 2017). The pathogenesis is attributed to mutations of several genes that help maintain telomere structure and function, such as the DKC1 gene. DKC1 gene encodes for the ribonucleoprotein dyskerin (Abdel-Karim et al., 2009;Ballew &amp; Savage, 2013). Most cases are inherited, and may be X-linked, autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive, with variable penetrance (Handley &amp; Ogden, 2006). The condition often arises early and should always be considered and excluded in a child presenting with oral leukoplakia.

Lichenoid like lesions have also been reported (Handley &amp; Ogden, 2006). The prognosis is often poor, due to either malignant change within the oral lesions or bone marrow failure resulting in overwhelming infection and death. Attempts have been made to identify potential markers for future cancerous change within these oral lesions. Evidence for disturbed cytokeratin, abnormal p53 expression and changes at an ultrastructural level (foetal/neonatal features) have been reported some 10 years before malignant change (McKay, Ogden, &amp; Chisholm, 1991;Ogden, Chisholm, Hopwood, &amp; Lane, 1993).

Lichenoid like lesions have also been reported (Handley &amp; Ogden, 2006). The prognosis is often poor, due to either malignant change within the oral lesions or bone marrow failure resulting in overwhelming infection and death. Attempts have been made to identify potential markers for future cancerous change within these oral lesions. Evidence for disturbed cytokeratin, abnormal p53 expression and changes at an ultrastructural level (foetal/neonatal features) have been reported some 10 years before malignant change (McKay, Ogden, &amp; Chisholm, 1991;Ogden, Chisholm, Hopwood, &amp; Lane, 1993).

        <p>It is a diagnostic challenge to clinically distinguish OLL from OLP. Recently, Aguirre-Urizar et al., (2020) proposed grouping OLP and OLLs under the term "oral lichenoid disease", which they define as a potentially malignant disorder of the oral mucosa that cannot be clinically or histopathologically diagnosed as any other specific oral disease. Oral lichenoid diseases encompass both OLP and OLL and characteristically show white papules (and reticular formation) and are sometimes accompanied by other types (erosive-ulcerative, atrophic, plaque, and bullous).It is a diagnostic challenge to clinically distinguish OLL from OLP.

        <p>OGVHD is reported in patients with haematologic malignancies receiving allogeneic stem cell transplants (Elad, Zadik, Caton, &amp; Epstein, 2019). They present in acute and chronic forms that usually involve several organs (Flowers, Kansu, &amp; Sullivan, 1999). Oral lesions with a lichenoid appearance, erythema, atrophy, and ulceration were reported in more than 90% of patients who suffered from GVHD (Schubert et al., 1984;Fricain et al., 2005). Since our previous Workshop Report on OPMDs (Warnakulasuriya et al., 2007), progression to cancer in OGVHD-related oral lichenoid lesions has subsequently been reported in several case studies (Demarosi, 2005;Mawardi et al., 2011;Frydrych, Kujan, &amp; Farah, 2019;Hashimoto, Nagao, Koie, Miyabe &amp; Saito, 2019).

        <p>CHC presents as an adherent white patch caused by a chronic fungal infection, usually Candida albicans (Farah et al., 2019). The clinical presentation is thick white plaques, or mixed red and nodular non-homogenous white patches most commonly involving the anterior buccal mucosae and commissures or on the dorsum of the tongue (Dilhari et al., 2016). There is some experimental evidence that Candida causes epithelial hyperproliferation (Sitheeque &amp; Samaranayake, 2003;Rast, Kullas, Southern, &amp; Davis, 2016). It is known that C. albicans dramatically modifies the clinical and histological aspects of oral white plaques commonly referred to as candida leukoplakia. Candida is frequently present in the biopsies of moderate and severe dysplasia and significant dysplastic changes are noted in the epithelium of candida leukoplakias harbouring Candida species (McCullough et al., 2002;Shukla et al., 2019). It is postulated that Candidarelated oral carcinogenesis could arise from acetaldehyde production from alcoholic beverages by specific Candida isoforms (Alnuaimi et al., 2016). Candidalysin -a cytolytic peptide toxin secreted by C. albicans -by interacting with Epithelial Growth Factor Receptors (EGFR) could activate human EGF pathways to produce increased cell proliferation (Ho et al., 2019).CHC presents as an adherent white patch caused by a chronic fungal infection, usually Candida albicans (Farah et al., 2019).

        <p>The distinction between candida leukoplakia and chronic hyperplastic candidosis is not clear and most authors consider these two terms synonymous. The first description of candidal leukoplakia was published by Cawson &amp; Lehner, (1968) and reviewed by Sitheeque &amp; Samaranayake, (2003). Both sets of authors emphasize that the lesions responded readily to antifungal treatment, which supports a causal relationship. Nevertheless, it must be noted that whilst many cases improve with antifungal treatment, they do not disappear completely. The current Working Group noted that it is important to have consistency in the way we use these two terms and that antifungal treatment should be part of the diagnostic process.The distinction between candida leukoplakia and chronic hyperplastic candidosis is not clear and most authors consider these two terms synonymous.

        <p>Verrucous hyperplasia of the oral mucosa -a relatively unrecognized entity that may resemble verrucous carcinoma both clinically and histologically was first described by Shear and Pindborg, (1980). VH was considered a precurser of verrucous carcinoma (Batsakis et al., 1999). A new entity was proposed by a group of South Asian pathologists to describe a "mass type" lesion with an exophytic and verrucous appearance specifically recognised among areca nut and betel quid users (Zain et al., 2016;Patil, Warnakulasuriya, Raj, Sanketh, &amp; Rao, 2016). This disorder was first noted in Taiwanese patients diagnosed with OPMDs (Wang et al., 2009) and the name proposed by these authors was oral verrucous hyperplasia. A second cohort was described later by the same group amongst which 6 (10%) developed an oral cancer (Wu et al., 2018). This disorder can present in two forms: 1) as an exophytic, fleshy verruco-papillary outgrowth with a white and/or pink surface colour or 2) as a white, plaque-like exophytic verrucous lesion. It typically manifests as a discrete or solitary lesion and may co-exist in patient presenting with oral submucous fibrosis.

        <p>The most common histopathological diagnosis reported for a cancer arising in a patient with an OPMD is a conventional squamous cell carcinoma. OPMDs are a heterogeneous and have variability in their ratios of progression to cancer (1.4% -49.5%) over a follow-up period ranging from 12 months to 20 years) (Iocca et al., 2019). Predicting the risk of transformation remains a significant challenge even in specialist practice. At one end of the spectrum patients diagnosed with PVL and erythroplakia show high frequencies of cancer development (close to 30-50%), and on the other hand, oral lichen planus (OLP) show lower frequencies of cancer development (1-2%).

        <p>Malignancy can arise from an area of "normal-looking" mucosa without the patient or a clinician being aware of an OPMD being present earlier at the site. This is consistent with the concept of a field change, that apparently normal mucosa may contain significant molecular aberrations that increase the likelihood of cancer (Nikitakis et al., 2018;Thomson, Goodson, &amp; Smith, 2017;Farah et al., 2018;Farah, Shearston, Nguyen, &amp; Kujan, 2019).Malignancy can arise from an area of "normal-looking" mucosa without the patient or a clinician being aware of an OPMD being present earlier at the site.

        <p>There is a need to further investigate the basic biology associated with the concept of field cancerisation as proposed by Slaughter et al., (1953) -not least in ensuring common terminology (Ogden &amp; Hall, 1997). Field cancerisation is characterized by phenotypic and genetic changes in the neighbouring areas of frank carcinomas, whilst the term "field change" should be reserved for alterations in tissues that show no evidence of disease clinically or histologically (Ogden, 1998). A proliferating field that gradually displaces the normal mucosa have been detected on the basis of mutations in TP53, whereas they are usually not detected by routine diagnostic techniques (Braakhuis, Tabor, Kummer, Leemans, &amp; Brakenhoff, 2003;Braakhuis, Leemans, &amp; Brakenhoff, 2005). Thus, the identification of a marker usually associated with malignant disease would signify a field change effect in the absence of histomorphological evidence of dysplasia. Such patients may not have yet developed nor indeed may never develop a tumour.There is a need to further investigate the basic biology associated with the concept of field cancerisation as proposed by Slaughter et al., (1953) -not least in ensuring common terminology (Ogden &amp; Hall, 1997).

        <p>An increased susceptibility of Fanconi anaemia (FA) patients to early-onset OSCCs -largely in the absence of known life-style risk factors -has been observed for decades. Fanconi anaemia (FA) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of DNA repair genes in which the defect(s) lie in the repair of DNA crosslinks. It is characterized by physical congenital anomalies (skeletal malformations), aplastic anaemia, and then progressive pancytopenia. FA may lead to bone marrow failure, leukemia, and/or solid tumours, including head and neck cancers, with oral squamous cell carcinoma being the most common type. Recently there has been renewed interest among researchers on development of OSCCs in FA. Masserot et al., (2008) described head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in 13 patients (8 in oral cavity) with Fanconi anemia after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In a systematic review Furquim et al., (2018) identified a total of 121 individuals affected by FA and OSCC among 47 published from 1970 to 2016. The tongue was the most affected site. The overall risk was estimated to increase 500 to 700-fold for head and neck cancer in FA patients compared to the general population (Kutler et al., 2003) and the majority developed carcinomas at an early age.

Masserot et al., (2008) described head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in 13 patients (8 in oral cavity) with Fanconi anemia after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In a systematic review Furquim et al., (2018) identified a total of 121 individuals affected by FA and OSCC among 47 published from 1970 to 2016. The tongue was the most affected site. The overall risk was estimated to increase 500 to 700-fold for head and neck cancer in FA patients compared to the general population (Kutler et al., 2003) and the majority developed carcinomas at an early age. Therefore, young people who develop HNSCC must receive</p>
        <p>FA diagnostic tests. Patients with FA can present with potentially malignant disorders, especially oral leukoplakia (Amenábar, Torres-Pereira ,Tang, &amp; Punyadeera, 2019). Among 138 Brazilian patients with FA who had not undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), 16 cases (12%) were diagnosed with oral leukoplakia, with a median age of 16.5 years (Cavalcanti et al., 2015)FA diagnostic tests.

        <p>Plummer-Vinson (Paterson-Kelly) syndrome (PVS) -a constellation of symptoms relating to postcricoid oesophageal webs, atrophic glossitis, koilonychia, and dysphagia considered to be caused by microcytic hypochromic anaemia -was linked to predisposition to upper digestive tract cancer. Barron, (1991) claimed in an analysis of a Welsh cohort that this syndrome no longer existed. Anaemia causes atrophy of the oral epithelium (Rennie et al., 1984;Ranasinghe et al., 1987) and could be a co-factor among people with OPMDs and deserves attention in future research.Plummer-Vinson (Paterson-Kelly) syndrome (PVS) -a constellation of symptoms relating to postcricoid oesophageal webs, atrophic glossitis, koilonychia, and dysphagia considered to be caused by microcytic hypochromic anaemia -was linked to predisposition to upper digestive tract cancer.

        <p>It has recently been suggested to replace the term OPMD with: "potentially premalignant oral epithelial lesion (PPOEL)" (Nikitakis, 2018;van der Waal, 2018). The terminology, oral potentially malignant disorders, is now well established in the literature with over 750 publications and the Working Group could not see any reason for change. Both in the 2007 paper, and here, we argue distinction between the terms "potentially malignant" and "premalignant": the former indicates an unknown potential for the later development of a malignant tumour; the latter an inevitability given sufficient time. "Potentially premalignant" may indicate lack of premalignancy. Moreover, changes observed in histology are not limited to epithelium and therefore "epithelial lesion" is inappropriate. Epithelial-connective tissue interactions are fundamental to homeostasis and disease and connective tissue changes are a striking component of many disorders (Vucicevic Boras et al., 2018;Johnson, 2020), including in oral lichen planus and oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) (Arakeri et al., 2018;Lodi et al., 2005).It has recently been suggested to replace the term OPMD with: "potentially premalignant oral epithelial lesion (PPOEL)" (Nikitakis, 2018;van der Waal, 2018).

        <p>This paper provides an update on the 2007 WHO Collaborating Centre's classification of oral potentially malignant disorders. The Working Group identified sufficient evidence on oral lichenoid lesions and oral graft versus host disease that merit their addition to the classification proposed in 2007. The natural history and the biological behaviour of many OPMDs remain unknown and there was consensus that further research on these disorders is warranted. A global research consortium to study OPMDs is needed to establish multi-site longitudinal studies with well-defined clinicopathological diagnostic criteria to address questions and characterise their natural history, and possibly to prevent development of oral cancer in patients diagnosed with these disorders. with diffuse borders; when found on alveolar ridges these are referred to as alveolar ridge keratosis (ARK); a white line along the occlusal plane is referred to as linea alba buccalis; Morsicatio buccarum is a condition characterized by chronic irritation or injury to the buccal mucosa, caused by repetitive chewing, biting or nibbling; None of these should be characterised as oral leukoplakia.This paper provides an update on the 2007 WHO Collaborating Centre's classification of oral potentially malignant disorders.
