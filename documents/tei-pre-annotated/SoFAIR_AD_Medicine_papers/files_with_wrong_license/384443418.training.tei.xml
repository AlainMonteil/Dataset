        <p>Twenty-four systematic reviews and meta-analyses were included. The majority of reviews were of moderate or high methodological quality. Physically active older adults (≥60 years) are at a reduced risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, breast and prostate cancer, fractures, recurrent falls, ADL disability and functional limitation and cognitive decline, dementia, Alzheimer's disease and depression. They also experience healthier ageing trajectories, better quality of life and improved cognitive functioning.Twenty-four systematic reviews and meta-analyses were included.

        <p>A global decline in fertility rates and increased life expectancy has resulted in the growth in the number and proportion of older adults in the world's population 1 . Increase in life expectancy represents one of the greatest public health successes of the 20 th century. The global population aged ≥60 years numbered 962 million in 2017. This is expected to double by 2050, when it is projected to reach nearly 2.1 billion 1 . Retaining physical and cognitive function and delaying the onset of illnesses and disability is a major challenge for many in older age. Maintaining physical function, independence and quality of life (QoL) among older adults are public health and economic imperatives 2,3 . Evidence suggests that the age-related declines in functional capacity, QoL, and increased risk of morbidity, disability and mortality may be offset or delayed by the adoption of more physically active lifestyles. International guidelines recommended that older adults should engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per week 2,3 . However, physical inactivity has become nearly ubiquitous, with an estimated 31% of the world's population not meeting recommended levels of physical activity 4 . The prevalence of physical inactivity in older Europeans (≥55years) has been reported to range from 5% in Sweden to 29% in Portugal 5 . Physical inactivity is recognised as one of the leading risk factors for overweight, obesity, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and chronic conditions. It has been identified as the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality (6% of deaths globally) 6 and is estimated as being the principal cause for approximately 21-25% of breast and colon cancer burden, and approximately 27% of diabetes and 30% of ischaemic heart disease burden 6 . Globally, physically inactive lifestyles have been estimated to cost (INT) $53•8 billion in direct health care costs annually. 7,8 However, these population health estimates of the impact of physical inactivity on health often fail to specifically elicit the benefits for older adults, despite the fact that this group may have more to gain from physical activity. Older adults are at a particular risk of leading inactive lifestyles. For many, ageing is defined by rapid declines in levels of physical activity, loss of mobility and functional independence and premature morbidity 9 . This stage of life represents an important period to promote physical activity to improve functions of daily living and slow progression of disease and disability. Therefore, this umbrella review aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic overview of the epidemiological evidence of the specific consequences of physical inactivity on physical and mental health outcomes in older adults.A global decline in fertility rates and increased life expectancy has resulted in the growth in the number and proportion of older adults in the world's population 1 .

        <p>We conducted a systematic search of six bibliographic databases (Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL and EBM reviews) from inception to November 1 st 2019, for systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses of longitudinal observational studies, investigating the relationship between physical activity and any physical or mental health outcome in adults aged ≥60 years. In addition, we hand-searched the reference lists of eligible articles and other narrative overviews of systematic reviews/meta-analyses. To be included in this umbrella review, articles had to be reviews including: adults aged ≥60 years (studies that enrolled participants &lt;60 years were excluded, even if the sample mean age was ≥60 years); case control or cohort longitudinal studies (retrospective and prospective cohorts) investigating the association of physical activity with any health-related outcome (e.g. cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, all-cause mortality, obesity/overweight, diabetes and metabolic diseases). Studies had to report these outcomes as relative risk (RR), odds ratio (OR), hazard ratio (HR) or continuous data and be published in English.We conducted a systematic search of six bibliographic databases (Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL and EBM reviews) from inception to November 1 st 2019, for systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses of longitudinal observational studies, investigating the relationship between physical activity and any physical or mental health outcome in adults aged ≥60 years.

        <p>Table 1 summarises the main findings for the included reviews and associations between physical activity and physical and mental health outcomes in older adults. The narrative synthesis of findings below describes in detail the association between physical activity and outcomes for chronic disease prevention and risk reduction (all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and CVD mortality, arterial stiffness, cancer prevention and mortality), functional status outcomes (musculoskeletal health, activities of daily living disability, functional limitations, healthy ageing, quality of life and risk of falling) and mental health outcomes (cognitive decline, dementia, Alzheimer's disease and incident depression) in older adults. We have reported all instances where the included reviews reported pooled effect sizes for analyses in older adult populations (Table 1).

        <p>All-cause mortality: Three systematic reviews with meta-analysis were included 14,16 . Two reviews were rated as low quality 14,16 and one was rated as high quality 15 (Table S2). Overall, the reduction in all-cause mortality ranged from 22% in older adults (≥60 years) who performed a low dose of MVPA (1-499 Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET)-min) 16 to 34% in participants (≥70 years) with high levels of total physical activity 15 . A dose-response relationship between physical activity and all-cause mortality was evident 14,16 . The greatest reduction in risk for older adults was seen in the difference in those doing the least-or no MVPA to some MVPA (1-499 MET-min per week) 16 . For those meeting guidelines of 150mins of MVPA per week (500-999 MET-min) mortality was reduced by 28% 16 (Table 1). The reduction in all-cause mortality was also considerably greater in older women compared to older men (32% compared to 14%) 16 . Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and CVD mortality: Two reviews assessed the association of physical activity and coronary heart disease (CHD) in older adults, 16,17 both of which were rated as low quality (Table S2). Batty (2002) concluded that older men benefit from a reduced CHD risk from physical activity but did not conduct a meta-analysis of the n=8 prospective cohort studies (n=19,085 participants) and n=1 case-control study (543 participants). In a separate included study, a significant reduction in the risk of CVD mortality of 25% for low doses of MVPA to 40% for high doses of MVPA compared to those who were inactive was identified in a meta-analysis of n=3 prospective cohort studies (n=66,316 participants) 16 (Table 1). Arterial stiffness: One low quality systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that physically active individuals had significantly lower arterial stiffness than their sedentary peers (standardized mean difference: -1.017 ± 0.340, 95% CI: -1.684 to -0.350, p = 0.003) 18 . Cancer prevention and mortality: Three low quality systematic reviews 16,19,20 (Table S2) assessed the relationship between physical activity and cancer. Physical activity was significantly associated with a 12% reduction in risk of breast cancer when comparing the highest vs the lowest level of activity 20 . A dose-response analysis revealed that breast cancer risk decreased by 2% for every 25 MET-h/week increment in non-occupational activity, 3% for every 10 MET-h/week increment in recreational activity, and 5% for every 2 h/week increment in moderate plus vigorous recreational activity, respectively 20 . Functional status outcomes Musculoskeletal (MSK) health: One high quality review 21 assessed the relationship between physical activity and MSK health. The meta-analysis of 22 prospective cohort studies (n=1,235,768 participants; 14,843 fracture cases) reports a 29% reduction in risk of total fractures (hip, wrist-and vertebral fractures) for the highest vs lowest category of physical activity (RR=0.71, 95% CI: 0.63 to 0.80). An analysis of fracture subtypes showed a significant reduction in risk of wrist fracture (28%) (RR=0.72, 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.96) among individuals with the highest category of physical activity compared to those with the lowest category. A sensitivity analysis of 10 studies with participants aged ≥62 years old reported a 31% reduction in relative risk of fracture according to the highest vs lowest category of physical activity (RR=0.69, 95% CI: 0.61 to 0.76) 21 .All-cause mortality: Three systematic reviews with meta-analysis were included 14,16 .

        <p>An included meta-analysis of (prospective) longitudinal studies for the prevention of onset and progression of basic activities of daily living (BADL) disability by physical activity 22 concluded that there was a 49% reduction in the incidence of BADL disability in older adults (aged ≥50 years) with a medium/high level of physical activity compared with those with a low physical activity level (OR=0.51, 95% CI: 0.38-to 0.68; n=9 studies; n=17,176 participants; medium quality review). In this review 'disability' was defined as having any difficulty in performing BADL (measured using self-report questionnaires and instruments including the ADL disability scale and the Physical Activities of Daily Living-Help (PADL-H) scale) to distinguish it from 'functional limitations' (defined as restrictions in basic and mental actions). A medium/high physical activity level vs low levels of physical activity also reduced the progression of BADL disability by 45% (OR=0.55, 95% CI: 0.42 to 0.71, p&lt;0.001; n=4 studies, n=8625 participants). The preventative effect was found in both older (≥75 years) and younger (&lt;74 years) individuals with and without diseases, and in older adults who already had functional limitations or disability 22 . Functional limitations: A medium quality systematic review for the relationship between physical activity and outcomes of impairment or functional limitation in older adults (&gt;65 years old) was included 23 . Functional outcomes included assessment of functional status decline, impairment or functional status limitations, or disability, measured using self-report questionnaire assessments such as the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and the HAQ disability index, or via physical performance tests (e.g. hand-grip strength, mobility activities, walking distance, stair climbing) 23 . Higher levels of physical activity predicted increased functional status in older age. Moderate and high levels of physical activity appeared effective in conferring a ~50% reduction in risk of functional limitations or disability (average odds ratio ~0.5). In higher-level functions (such as walking a distance or climbing stairs) the relative risk or odds of functional decline or limitation was significantly reduced in those more physically active (~50% reduction in the high activity group). Longitudinal data from 6 studies (n=3918) also reports that those exercising at high levels in middle age (e.g. jogging regularly) postponed a disability or functional limitation and prolonged disability-free life (13.2 years mean follow-up time) 23 . Healthy ageing: One high quality systematic review with meta-analysis was included 24 . Healthy ageing is defined as the process of developing and maintaining the functional ability that enables wellbeing in older age 25 . In the included review, healthy ageing was used as a collective term whereby a number of outcomes were grouped, for example; living to a specific age or during follow up; health status (measures included the patient health questionnaire (PHQ) and the self-rated life satisfaction questionnaire); physical performance; diseases (assessed via medical history questionnaire) 24 . A sensitivity analysis with participants aged ≥65 years of age at baseline showed a significant positive association between physical activity and healthy ageing (ES=1.14, 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.22, p&lt;0.001).An included meta-analysis of (prospective) longitudinal studies for the prevention of onset and progression of basic activities of daily living (BADL) disability by physical activity 22 concluded that there was a 49% reduction in the incidence of BADL disability in older adults (aged ≥50 years) with a medium/high level of physical activity compared with those with a low physical activity level (OR=0.51, 95% CI: 0.38-to 0.68; n=9 studies; n=17,176 participants; medium quality review).

        <p>A medium quality systematic review for the association between physical activity and QoL in older adults was included 12 . Measures of QoL in this review included the World Health Organisation QoL-100 (WHO QoL-100), Health Related Qol (HR-QoL), Short Form-36 (SF-36), and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) 12 . Physical activity had a consistent positive association with a number of QoL domains; functional capacity; general QoL; autonomy; past, present and future activities; death and dying; intimacy; mental health; vitality; and psychological 12 . However, only four of the 31 included studies were prospective cohort studies.A medium quality systematic review for the association between physical activity and QoL in older adults was included 12 .

        <p>A high quality systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based and longitudinal studies for the association of physical activity and risk of falling in community dwelling older adults concluded that the risk of being a recurrent faller (two or more selfreported falls over the follow-up period of 12-36 months) was 39% higher in those older adults with the lowest levels of physical activity. However, the association between any fall and physical activity level was inconclusive (Table 1) 26 .A high quality systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based and longitudinal studies for the association of physical activity and risk of falling in community dwelling older adults concluded that the risk of being a recurrent faller (two or more selfreported falls over the follow-up period of 12-36 months) was 39% higher in those older adults with the lowest levels of physical activity.

        <p>Cognitive decline: Three medium quality 23,27,28 and three high quality systematic reviews with meta-analysis for the relationship between physical activity and cognitive decline were included 11,29,30 . Common diagnostic criteria included use of the Modified Mental State Examination (MMSE) and clinical evaluation, Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) and the Mental State Questionnaire (MSQ). The reduction in risk of cognitive decline ranged from a 26% reduction from moderate levels of physical activity compared with no/lowest levels of physical activity 29 to a 38% reduction in those who performed a high level of physical activity 30 . Low-to-moderate level of activity showed a significant protection (35% reduction in RR) against cognitive impairment 30 . Furthermore, an analysis of participants aged ≥65 years reported a reduction in the risk of cognitive decline of 36% by staying highly physically active 29 . The collective evidence from a number of the included reviews suggests that physical activity may help to improve cognitive function and, consequently, delay the progression of cognitive impairment in older adults 23,27,28 Dementia: Two high quality reviews with meta-analysis 11,29 , two medium quality systematic literature reviews 23,31 and one medium quality systematic review with meta-analysis were included 32 . Common diagnostic criteria included the Mini Mental State Examination (3MS), MMSE, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The evidence suggests that habitual physical activity reduces the subsequent risk of dementia in healthy older adults 23 . Higher levels of physical activity are associated with a 14% 11 to 21% 29 reduction in the risk of dementia. Higher intensity of physical activity reduced all-cause dementia risk by 28% 32 . An analysis of moderate intensity physical activity reported a risk reduction of 24% 29 . Observations of the protective effect of physical activity were consistent in comparative analysis of studies with a follow up period greater-and less than 5 years, and with sample sizes greater-and less than 1000 participants. There is a significant risk reduction effect (26%) of physical activity for people beyond the age of 65 developing all-cause dementia while insignificant for people below the age of 65 years 29 (Table 1). Both moderate and high levels of physical activity reduced risk of vascular dementia in older adults (Table 1) 32 . Alzheimer's disease (AD): Three medium 33,34,32 and two high-quality 29,35 reviews with metaanalysis were included. Studies included in the reviews represented a global distribution of older adult populations. Diagnostic criteria included the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA), MMSE and the DSM. The relative risk reduction of AD with physical activity ranged from 32% 32 to 42% 34 in participants with higher levels of physical activity compared to those with lower levels. The findings indicate that physical activity may be an important protective factor against AD in older adults. For those older adults (~70-80 years on average) meeting international physical activity recommendations of ≥150 min/week of MVPA, risk of development of AD (approximately 5 or more years later) was reduced by 40% 35 . Furthermore, the estimated Population Attributable Risk percentage (PAR%) was particularly high for lower vs higher physical activity level (31.9%) 34 . Incident depression: One high quality meta-analysis was included 36 . The study evaluated participants who were free of depression or depressive symptoms at baseline, and evaluated incident depression as the outcome, including (among other measures) increased depressive symptoms through established cut-offs of depression screening instruments, or based on selfreport or physician diagnosis of depression 36 . Participants with higher physical activity levels were at reduced odds (17% reduction in risk) of incident depression when compared with people with lower physical activity levels. Completing 150 minutes per week of MVPA was protective for incident depression in adjusted OR and adjusted RR analyses. A sensitivity analysis of data from cohorts of older participants with higher physical activity levels reported a 21% reduction in incident depression when compared with people with lower physical activity levels in adjusted OR and adjusted RR analyses (30% reduction in RR).Cognitive decline: Three medium quality 23,27,28 and three high quality systematic reviews with meta-analysis for the relationship between physical activity and cognitive decline were included 11,29,30 .

        <p>This umbrella review has identified that physically active older adults (≥60 years) are at a reduced risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (low quality evidence); breast and prostate cancer (low quality evidence); fractures (high quality evidence); ADL disability, functional limitation (medium quality evidence) and risk of falling (high quality evidence); and cognitive decline, dementia, Alzheimer's disease and depression (high quality evidence). They also experience healthier ageing trajectories (high quality evidence); better quality of life (medium quality evidence) and improved cognitive functioning (medium quality evidence). Emerging evidence demonstrates that there are health benefits of physical activity for older adults below levels that are currently recommended.This umbrella review has identified that physically active older adults (≥60 years) are at a reduced risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (low quality evidence); breast and prostate cancer (low quality evidence); fractures (high quality evidence); ADL disability, functional limitation (medium quality evidence) and risk of falling (high quality evidence); and cognitive decline, dementia, Alzheimer's disease and depression (high quality evidence).

        <p>The findings provide compelling evidence of positive associations between physical activity and lower rates of morbidity and mortality in older adults. This evidence is consistent with the evidence for the health benefits of physical activity in younger age groups 2 . Typically, the analyses in the included reviews compared the highest and lowest categories of physical activity. However, evidence in the included reviews demonstrates emerging evidence that there are protective effects for older adults who participate in a level of activity well below current recommendations. A weekly dose of MVPA corresponding to 75 min per week has been shown to be associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality by 22% 16 . This level of physical activity represents a reasonable primary target for older inactive adults. Starting with small increases in physical activity may encourage some older adults, who were previously physically inactive or chronically ill, to progressively incorporate more activity into their daily routine. Fractures, which are often a consequence of falls, are one of the most serious musculoskeletal problems seen in the older adult population 37 . Physical activity has been identified as a lifestyle factor that may influence the risk of falls and fractures in adults through maintaining mobility, physical functioning, bone mineral density, muscle strength, and balance 38 . The risk of recurrent falls was reduced in older adults with higher levels of physical activity, and although the association of falling (any fall) with physical activity was inconclusive 26 , other reviews evaluating the association of usual physical activity with the risk of falling in the general population have suggested a general decrease in risk 38 , and a strong positive relationship between fall-related efficacy (perceived self-confidence at avoiding falls during essential, relatively non-hazardous activities) and activity 13 . Increasing levels of physical activity within an appropriate range has been shown to reduce the risk of hip fractures in general population studies of men and women 38,39 . Engaging in higher levels of physical activity also reduced the risk of total fractures by 29% and significantly reduced the risk of wrist fracture by 28% 21 .The findings provide compelling evidence of positive associations between physical activity and lower rates of morbidity and mortality in older adults.

        <p>Maintaining functional status is an important part of active ageing and reducing age-related morbidity. The evidence in this review suggests that greater physical activity predicts higher functional status in older age. Physical activity reduces the age-related decline in functional capacity and maintains muscle strength and mass among adults aged 65-85 years 23 . The risk of developing functional limitations or BADL disability 22,23 and the progression of BADL disability was reduced by participation in physical activity 22 . Emerging evidence also highlights the positive impact of physical activity on the healthy ageing process, by improving QoL 12 and increasing the odds of maintaining well-being in older age 24 . Finally, as the global population ages, the number of people living with cognitive impairment or dementia is expected to increase dramatically, with some estimates suggesting that the number of people living with dementia will triple from 50 million to 152 million by 2050 40 . Changes in physical function often occur with cognitive losses, which can then accelerate the risk of disability and need for care. Evidence contained within this review suggests that all levels of physical activity confer significant and consistent protection against the occurrence of cognitive decline in people without dementia 11,29,30 . Growing evidence also reports that physical activity can improve cognitive function and, consequently, delay the progression of cognitive impairment in older adults 23,27,28,41Maintaining functional status is an important part of active ageing and reducing age-related morbidity.

        <p>We employed strict criteria in the final selection of searched literature and implemented procedures to ensure high-quality implementation of the methodology. Two independent investigators followed an a priori protocol to perform the data extraction, data analysis and quality assessment of the methods of included systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The inclusion of only longitudinal study designs (most often in the form of cohort studies) is a strength of this review, enabling an evaluation the relationship between physical activity, risk factors and the development of disease over time. This allows some inference regarding causation from the evidence, however reverse causality cannot be completely ruled out. This review has several limitations: 'gray' literature was not included and the search was limited to journal articles published in English. We also did not meta-analyse data from individual studies, therefore there may be some overlap in the evidence presented in different reviews. We did however report effect sizes that reflected the greatest control for potential confounders from each meta-analysis. It is also worth noting that the main methodological limitation of the majority of studies in the included reviews was the use of subjective methods for physical activity assessment. This heterogeneity may have led to some underestimation or exaggeration of the observed relationships, although the majority of studies reported the use of appropriate methods to assess publication bias and adjust for heterogeneity in analysis.We employed strict criteria in the final selection of searched literature and implemented procedures to ensure high-quality implementation of the methodology.

        <p>For those older adults meeting international physical activity recommendations there is a significant reduction in risk of all-cause mortality, Alzheimer's disease and incident depression. The included reviews also consistently report that the greatest risk reduction across health outcomes comes with higher levels and intensities of physical activity. This review also contains emerging meta-analytic evidence that moderate intensity physical activity may be sufficient for reducing the risk of all-cause dementia in older adults 29 and that some of the protective benefits of physical activity for older adults are accrued well below current guidelines for health 16 , both areas which require further investigation to potentially support a greater number of older adults to become more physically active. A number of included reviews also advocate the need for further research to demonstrate the relationships between health outcomes and habitual physical activity with objective measurement of physical activity. An emerging area requiring further research is the influence sedentary behaviour exerts on health in older adults, independent of physical activity. Physical activity plays a key role in the 'compression of morbidity' decreasing the time spent in ill-health as people age and ensuring that an increase in life expectancy is also an increase in life-time spent in good health. To make active and healthy ageing a reality by keeping older adults healthy, independent and fulfilled, it is imperative that policies and actions in addressing physical inactivity in older adults reflect this emerging evidence.For those older adults meeting international physical activity recommendations there is a significant reduction in risk of all-cause mortality, Alzheimer's disease and incident depression.

This review highlights that those older adults who are physically active experience healthier ageing trajectories. However, evidence shows that many older adults are not engaging in sufficient levels of physical activity to attain these health benefits 5 . This stage of life represents an important period to promote physical activity to improve functions of daily living and slow progression of disease and disability. To unlock the benefits of physical activity it is imperative that policy and practice supports older adults to achieve the recommended levels of physical activity 44 .
