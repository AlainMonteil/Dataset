Given the exponential growth of the disease, patients with COVID-19 may overwhelm the emergency department (ED), medical floors, intensive care unit resources, personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies, and medical staff.

The United States now has the highest number of documented COVID-19 patients in the world, and it is likely that we will be managing patients with this disease over at least the next 12-18 months..

There is a recognition of two major challenges in providing recommendations for AMI care in the COVID-19 era:</p>
        <p>1) Cardiovascular manifestations in the COVID-19 patient are complex: patients may present with AMI, myocarditis simulating a STEMI presentation, stress cardiomyopathy, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary spasm, or myocardial injury without a documented Type I or Type II AMI.

[1][2][3][4][5][6] ; and</p>
        <p>2) The prevalence of COVID-19 disease in the US population remains unknown. In certain regions, community spread of SARS-CoV2 is prevalent, and the sensitivity of testing is imperfect. Further, patients testing positive for COVID-19 can be asymptomatic despite significant abnormalities noted on chest computed tomography (CT) scan and there appears to be significant risk of asymptomatic transmission of the disease. [9][10] Therefore, a balance must be struck in identifying appropriate patients for invasive approaches to AMI regardless of their COVID-19 status, and maintaining the safety of healthcare workers who might be exposed to the disease as well as minimizing contamination of cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL) facilities. The need for additional patient evaluation might translate into some delays in reperfusion. A small study from Hong Kong examining the care of STEMI patients during the COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated a delay in symptom onset to medical contact times suggesting that there may also be patient and/or or systems-related delays in medical care during this pandemic. 6 In addition, there has been a reduction in STEMI activations, reflecting a reluctance to seek medical attention or misdiagnoses given the focus on respiratory issues. 11 Given this complexity, a reassessment of the current strategies for efficient and effective management of AMI during the COVID-19 pandemic is required. This is addressed with a focus on 1) clinical presentation including STEMI, cardiogenic shock, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), and non-STEMI; 2) PPE for health care workers; 3) role of the ED, EMS and CCL; and 4) Regional STEMI systems of care. We conclude with recommendations that balance the benefits and risks of invasive management of ischemic heart disease, as well as health care team protections, anticipating these recommendations to be relevant during the entire period of the US coronavirus pandemic.2) The prevalence of COVID-19 disease in the US population remains unknown.

        <p>Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the standard of care for patients presenting to PCI centers (within 90 minutes of first medical contact). 7 This should remain the standard of care for STEMI patients during the COVID-19 pandemic with some important caveats (Table 1)(Figures 1 and2). Until we can firmly establish the prevalence of the disease in the general population of the country, all patients presenting with a suspected STEMI should be considered COVID-19 possible. With a primary PCI strategy, ED stays should be focused and patients should be transferred to the CCL as expeditiously as possible. Yet, additional time to establish an AMI diagnosis may be indicated (e.g. in some cases, echocardiography to assess for wall motion), and/or for COVID-19 status assessment and potential treatment (e.g. respiratory support).Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the standard of care for patients presenting to PCI centers (within 90 minutes of first medical contact). 7 This should remain the standard of care for STEMI patients during the COVID-19 pandemic with some important caveats (Table 1)(Figures 1 and2).

        <p>In certain circumstances, a more detailed and confirmatory evaluation in the ED might be required prior to transfer to the CCL. Thus, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there may be longer door-to balloon (D2B) times. D2B times should still be tracked, but we may expect more patient and/or system-related delays documented as appropriate reasons for delay in the ACC National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) programs (Chest Pain-MI and/or CathPCI). These programs are also working to support direct COVID-19 status documentation to further inform patient risk and local quality of care assessments.In certain circumstances, a more detailed and confirmatory evaluation in the ED might be required prior to transfer to the CCL.

        <p>Two point-of-care assays have recently received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for rapidly making the diagnosis of COVID-19. 12 As these tests become widely available, they should be routinely implemented in all STEMI patients to better characterize patient diagnosis and risk, optimize the treatment plan for a given patient (for AMI +/-COVID-19), and guide appropriate placement within the hospital, including a dedicated CCL and postprocedure unit.Two point-of-care assays have recently received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for rapidly making the diagnosis of COVID-19. 12 As these tests become widely available, they should be routinely implemented in all STEMI patients to better characterize patient diagnosis and risk, optimize the treatment plan for a given patient (for AMI +/-COVID-19), and guide appropriate placement within the hospital, including a dedicated CCL and postprocedure unit.</p>
        <p>It is important to emphasize that primary PCI should remain the standard of care, including for COVID-19 confirmed or probable patients. Once primary PCI is performed on the infarct related artery, if clinically safe and indicated, any high grade disease in a non-infarct related artery should also be treated during the index procedure to minimize further exposure of the CCL staff during a staged procedure. Primary PCI is superior for establishing normal (TIMI grade 3) coronary flow compared to an initial fibrinolysis strategy and has a significantly lower risk of fatal and nonfatal bleeding complications 7 . Furthermore, after a fibrinolysis-based strategy, just over 50% of patients reperfuse resulting in a high proportion of patients requiring rescue PCI. 7 This can result in prolonged ICU hospitalization with attendant exposure to multiple healthcare providers and limiting access of ICU beds for COVID-19 patients.It is important to emphasize that primary PCI should remain the standard of care, including for COVID-19 confirmed or probable patients.

        <p>In addition, some of these patients may have a "STEMI-mimicker" such as focal myocarditis or stress cardiomyopathy known to be associated with COVID-19 13,14 . Fibrinolysis of these patients would provide no benefit to the patient, but still incur bleeding risk and eventual invasive diagnostic catheterization given that the ST-elevation is unlikely to resolve. Each primary PCI center will need to monitor the ability to provide timely primary PCI based on staff and PPE availability, need for additional testing, as well as a designated CCL which will require terminal cleaning after each procedure. In the absence of these resources, a fibrinolysis first approach should be considered.In addition, some of these patients may have a "STEMI-mimicker" such as focal myocarditis or stress cardiomyopathy known to be associated with COVID-19 13,14 .

        <p>For patients who have an unclear, or equivocal, diagnosis of STEMI due to atypical symptoms, diffuse ST-segment elevation or atypical ECG findings, or a delayed presentation, additional noninvasive evaluation in the ED is recommended (Figure 1). The focus of this evaluation is two-fold: 1) further risk stratification for COVID-19 status and 2) further evaluation of the diagnosis specifically assessing the potential for coronary thrombotic occlusion versus other pathologies. Either a point of care ultrasound (POCUS) of the heart or a traditional transthoracic echocardiographic evaluation to assess for wall motion abnormality consistent with the electrocardiographic change may provide valuable information. Available clinical, ECG, laboratory and imaging data can inform a decision between the ED physician and interventional cardiologist regarding CCL activation. Coronary CT angiography may be considered in cases where the findings of ST elevation and transthoracic echocardiography are divergent. One clear advantage of an invasive approach to STEMI in the current era is the ability to diagnose a thrombotic coronary occlusion (as opposed to stress cardiomyopathy or myocarditis) before embarking on an early reperfusion approach. Regardless, patients with hemodynamic instability might still require an invasive evaluation in the CCL to make a definitive diagnosis and provide necessary hemodynamic assessment and support.For patients who have an unclear, or equivocal, diagnosis of STEMI due to atypical symptoms, diffuse ST-segment elevation or atypical ECG findings, or a delayed presentation, additional noninvasive evaluation in the ED is recommended (Figure 1).

        <p>We note that not all COVID-19 patients with ST elevation with/without an acute coronary occlusion will benefit from any reperfusion strategy or advanced mechanical support. In COVID-19 confirmed patients with severe pulmonary decompensation (adult respiratory distress syndrome) or pneumonia who are intubated in the ICU and felt to have an excessively high mortality, consideration for compassionate medical care may be appropriate. This decision is best made by each local healthcare team based on individual patient prognosis, patient and family wishes, as well as the resources available at their specific healthcare system.We note that not all COVID-19 patients with ST elevation with/without an acute coronary occlusion will benefit from any reperfusion strategy or advanced mechanical support.

        <p>Primary PCI is the standard of care for patients transferred rapidly from non-PCI centers (within 120 minutes of first medical contact at Referral Hospital). 7 For patients in whom rapid reperfusion with primary PCI is not feasible, a pharmacoinvasive approach is recommended with initial fibrinolysis followed by consideration of transfer to a PCI center (Figure 3). 15,16 Transfer to a PCI center following fibrinolysis in the pre-COVID-19 period was generally considered routine and should remain the standard of care. However, patients with STEMI at a referral hospital with established COVID-19 infection should be discussed prior to transfer to a PCI center. Fibrinolysis within 30 minutes of STEMI diagnosis, and transfer for rescue PCI when necessary, may be preferable for all COVID-19 positive STEMI patients who are at a referral hospital provided the diagnosis of a true STEMI is highly likely.Primary PCI is the standard of care for patients transferred rapidly from non-PCI centers (within 120 minutes of first medical contact at Referral Hospital). 7 For patients in whom rapid reperfusion with primary PCI is not feasible, a pharmacoinvasive approach is recommended with initial fibrinolysis followed by consideration of transfer to a PCI center (Figure 3). 15,16 Transfer to a PCI center following fibrinolysis in the pre-COVID-19 period was generally considered routine and should remain the standard of care.

        <p>While fibrinolysis first as a therapeutic strategy has been proposed for COVID-19 STEMI patients based on the experience from Sichuan hospital in China, 17 this might be more applicable in regions with limited primary PCI centers. In the United States, we propose that an initial fibrinolysis therapy be used in non-PCI capable hospitals if the first medical contact to reperfusion is felt to be &gt;120 minutes. In the era of COVID-19, each regional STEMI system will need to closely monitor transfer processes and times with active adjustment to a fibrinolysis first approach if delays ensue that might not have been present prior to the pandemic. As outlined above, in the presence of an equivocal diagnosis of a STEMI in a COVID-19 positive or probable patient, additional noninvasive imaging should help determine if the patient is likely to have ST-elevation associated with an occluded coronary artery, and therefore might benefit from a fibrinolysis reperfusion approach.While fibrinolysis first as a therapeutic strategy has been proposed for COVID-19 STEMI patients based on the experience from Sichuan hospital in China, 17 this might be more applicable in regions with limited primary PCI centers.

        <p>Patients with resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and/or cardiogenic shock will continue to be the highest risk subgroup of AMI patients. These patients will also be the highest risk for droplet-based spread of COVID-19. Patients with resuscitated OHCA should be selectively considered for CCL activation in the presence of persistent ST-elevation on their electrocardiogram, and a concomitant wall motion abnormality on echocardiographic evaluation. We recommend that OHCA patients without ST-elevation not receive a routine early invasive approach unless hemodynamic instability ensues, an acute coronary occlusion remains high on the differential diagnosis, and a multidisciplinary team concurs. 18,19 Appropriate PPE for the healthcare team in the emergency department and the CCL are required regardless of COVID-19 status since history may be limited in these patients. Consideration of revascularization and potential mechanical circulatory support (MCS) for patients in cardiogenic shock should proceed with PPE and special precautions for high droplet components of the procedure (i.e. intubation and extubation in negative pressure room by anesthesia if possible; intubation prior to arrival in the CCL).Patients with resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and/or cardiogenic shock will continue to be the highest risk subgroup of AMI patients.

        <p>For known COVID-19 positive or probable patient, while MCS might be considered for a cardiomyopathy and cardiogenic shock, venous-venous (V-V) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) should be considered for severe pulmonary decompensation and failure to oxygenate. When feasible, bedside placement of MCS or ECMO might decrease the risk of exposure to the CCL or cardiothoracic surgical team. The approach is dependent on local resources and the COVID-19 disease burden in the community. Finally, there are not enough data at this time to state whether advanced support devices for COVID-19 associated cardiovascular pathology will positively impact mortality rates and thus individual patient risk assessment is required.For known COVID-19 positive or probable patient, while MCS might be considered for a cardiomyopathy and cardiogenic shock, venous-venous (V-V) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) should be considered for severe pulmonary decompensation and failure to oxygenate.

        <p>The ED is the place of initial medical contact for the majority of patients with STEMI in the United States. For the past two decades, the priority in emergency medicine in caring for these patients has been to rapidly diagnose STEMI and aim for urgent reperfusion. However, as mentioned previously, the electrocardiographic diagnosis of STEMI is more difficult in the presence of COVID-19. It is important to emphasize that liberal use of the electrocardiogram in both the prehospital setting and the ED is still encouraged. Respiratory viral infections are known to increase the incidence of true STEMI (i.e. acute coronary occlusion) 25 , but myocarditis has been reported in cases of COVID-19 2,13 . As the electrocardiographic distinction between a true STEMI versus COVID-19 associated myocarditis can be challenging, additional noninvasive testing in consultation with cardiologist may be warranted.The ED is the place of initial medical contact for the majority of patients with STEMI in the United States.

In the setting of cardiac arrest, the use of PPE is even more critical for the reasons stated earlier.Therefore, we recommend that prehospital care providers have a low threshold of wearing appropriate protective equipment whenever responding to patients with a primary cardiac complaint.

        <p>Certain Emergency Medical System (EMS) STEMI protocols around the United States allow the prehospital care providers to activate their local hospital CCL when diagnosing STEMI in the field and directly transport the patient from the ambulance to the CCL ("ED Bypass"). This has contributed to reductions in first medical contact-to-balloon time and improved patient care. However, due to the logistical issues and time delays secondary to diagnostic uncertainty of STEMI with COVID-19, direct transport of the patient to the CCL is not felt to be prudent at this time. Therefore, we recommend initial assessment of all STEMI patients in the ED during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure the correct diagnosis and care plan (Figure 2). The attending interventional cardiologist should be notified, but without activation of the entire STEMI team until the plan for CCL activation is confirmed.Certain Emergency Medical System (EMS) STEMI protocols around the United States allow the prehospital care providers to activate their local hospital CCL when diagnosing STEMI in the field and directly transport the patient from the ambulance to the CCL ("ED Bypass").

        <p>Regional systems of care for patients with STEMI have emphasized efficiency and simplicity 8,26 . A fundamental strength of regional STEMI systems has been the ability to standardize protocols and provide quality improvement for a wide range of non-PCI hospitals, including community hospitals without on-site PCI 8 . The COVID-19 epidemic has quickly altered the landscape for regional STEMI care and systems and interventional cardiology teams are now faced with a new set of circumstances in which modified recommendations for care are expected and warranted. Regional systems of care for STEMI require close integration of EMS, ED providers, and STEMI referral hospitals in conjunction with the PCI center team. Each component of the regional STEMI system has its own inherent risk of COVID-19 infection/spread, as well as its own potential for delay in reperfusion for patients with STEMI.Regional systems of care for patients with STEMI have emphasized efficiency and simplicity 8,26 .

        <p>Based on early experience in China and Europe, key challenges include the availability of ICU beds, ventilators, ECMO, and the risk to HCW (including EMS personnel, ED staff and specialized diagnostic and treatment units like the CCL). As the US experience with COVID-19 is rapidly evolving, definitive best practices are clearly challenging and require flexibility for a complex regional care system. Based upon these new operational risks and patient comorbidities, it is imperative to consider immediate adjustments that maximize treatment options for patients with acute cardiovascular emergencies while protecting the safety of patients and providers. We propose the following guiding principles for Transfer STEMI Regional Systems of Care in the era of coronavirus (Table II)(Figure 3). These recommendations will need to be adapted to each regional system's PCI Center, STEMI referral hospitals, and EMS system and need to be communicated clearly between cardiology and emergency medicine providers within each hospital. As the COVID-19 pandemic grows or recedes, this algorithm will need to be updated and adapted but will eventually return to the principles of simplicity and efficiency previously outlined in the STEMI Accelerator program and the ACC/AHA Guidelines 7,8,26 . For now, each system must recognize the competing and equally important principles of (A) timely reperfusion of STEMI patients, B) safe regional transport and treatment of potentially high-risk patients and C) additional emphasis on protection and safety of all health care personnel. testing be expeditiously disseminated to all hospitals involved in the care of patients with AMI.Based on early experience in China and Europe, key challenges include the availability of ICU beds, ventilators, ECMO, and the risk to HCW (including EMS personnel, ED staff and specialized diagnostic and treatment units like the CCL).

        <p>Finally, we believe that each regional STEMI care network needs to revise their suggested algorithm for its local environment and ensure that EMS and referral hospital teams are facile with a balanced and standardized approach towards STEMI care during the COVID-19 pandemic. On transfer of a patient with a STEMI from a referral hospital to a PCI center, the patient should be reevaluated for the COVID-19 status and STEMI diagnosis. The patient can then be taken for primary PCI, pharmacoinvasive PCI or rescue PCI, as indicated.Finally, we believe that each regional STEMI care network needs to revise their suggested algorithm for its local environment and ensure that EMS and referral hospital teams are facile with a balanced and standardized approach towards STEMI care during the COVID-19 pandemic.
