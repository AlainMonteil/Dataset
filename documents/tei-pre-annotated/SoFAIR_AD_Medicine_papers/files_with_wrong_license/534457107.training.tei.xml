        <p>The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic. Globally, 10 million infections have been confirmed with 500,000 fatalities. 1 The novel coronavirus had first been reported in Hubei province of China in late 2019, where it caused a major cluster of atypical pneumonia. 2- 4 Despite major efforts to contain the original outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 has since spread globally. [5][6][7][8] Following the 2002/2003 SARS and 2012 MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) epidemics, this marks the third notable coronavirus outbreak in the 21 st century. 6,9 Four additional coronaviruses can infect humans, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43, 10 which in stark contrast to the highly contagious and pathogenic SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, 7,11,12 cause only mild respiratory illness, like the common cold. 13 The case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 is estimated to be lower than for SARS (~10%) and MERS (~35%). However, its basic reproduction number (R0) is potentially higher than for SARS (~2-3) and MERS (&lt;1). The exact values for CFR and R0 of SARS-CoV-2 are still under controversial debate. 14,15 Undetected, asymptomatic infections can challenge the accuracy of these parameters. [16][17][18][19] The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on individuals and the economy, as travel restrictions, social distancing and quarantine measures were implemented by many countries. 20,21 SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 belong to the family of Coronaviridae and the genus Betacoronavirus. Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that feature the largest known RNA virus genomes ranging approximately from 26 to 32 kb, [22][23][24][25][26] containing at least 6 (14 in case of SARS-CoV-2) open reading frames (ORFs). 27,28 The major reading frame ORF 1ab encodes for two overlapping polyproteins (pp1a, pp1ab), which are cleaved into 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-16) by the main protease M pro (also referred to as 3CL pro ) and the papain-like protease PL pro (Fig. 1). 27,[29][30][31][32] In addition, the papainlike protease is also a deubiquitinase. 33 The remainder of the genome encodes for accessory and structural proteins such as the spike glycoprotein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M) and the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N). 27,[29][30][31][32] The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 deposited in Genbank was from the ~30 kb isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (MN908947), 3 which is used for sequence-related analyses in this article. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to other viruses of the Betacoronavirus genus such as the bat coronavirus BatCoV RaTG13 (~96% sequence identity) and the SARS-CoV (~80% sequence identity). 34,35 SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are both of zoonotic origin, with bats being their natural reservoir. Transmission to humans can occur via their intermediate hosts palm civets (SARS) and dromedary camels (MERS). 36 SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have followed a similar evolutionary transmission cascade. 37,38 The spike glycoprotein (S) plays an important role in host range (tropism) and 'host jumps'. 39,40 In the case of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, it recognises the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2), which both viruses employ for cell entry. [41][42][43] Comparison of structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2, such as the spike protein (S), with those from animal coronaviruses indicate the involvement of bats as natural reservoir with a possibility for pangolins as intermediate hosts. 38,[44][45][46][47][48][49] As the introduction of coronaviruses into human population has been observed on multiple occasions, a better understanding of the naturally circulating viruses is of high interest for pandemic prevention as is antiviral research to prepare for future outbreaks. 50,51 The main protease as drug targetThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic.

        <p>The current COVID-19 pandemic has triggered global efforts for the rapid identification of vaccines and specific antiviral treatments. [52][53][54][55] Amongst the coronaviral targets that have been studied in the past, the main protease (M pro , 3CLpro, nsp5) received major attention, 25,56 particularly following the first SARS-CoV outbreak in the early 2000s. 23,57 Alternative coronaviral targets include the spike protein (S), RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp, nsp12), NTPase/helicase (nsp13) and papain-like protease (PL pro , part of nsp3). 50,58 The papain-like protease also recognises the C-terminal sequence of ubiquitin. Therefore, substratederived inhibitors of PL pro would be expected to also inhibit host-cell deubiquitinases, making drug-discovery campaigns against PL pro challenging. In stark contrast, the main protease M pro exclusively cleaves polypeptide sequences after a glutamine residue, positioning the main protease as an ideal drug target because, to the best of our knowledge, no human host-cell proteases are known with this substrate specificity. [59][60][61] Viral proteases are well validated drug targets that have led to various approved drugs, for example, against chronic infections with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), which employ aspartyl and serine proteases, respectively. 62 The SARS-CoV-2 M pro proteolytically cleaves the overlapping pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins to functional proteins (Fig. 1), which is a critical step during viral replication. 29,63,64 Replication-essential enzymes such as the RdRp or nsp13 cannot fully function without prior proteolytic release, 56 positioning M pro as a key enzyme in the viral replication cycle. Consequently, its inhibition can stall the production of infectious viral particles and thus alleviate disease symptoms. 23,50,[65][66][67][68] Capitalising on knowledge gained on structure and inhibitors of M pro from previous epidemical coronaviruses, M pro is one of the most attractive viral targets for antiviral drug discovery against SARS-CoV-2.The current COVID-19 pandemic has triggered global efforts for the rapid identification of vaccines and specific antiviral treatments.

        <p>Early homology models of SARS-CoV-2 M pro indicated close structural relation to other coronaviral main proteases. 69 Amino acid sequence alignments reveal ~99% identity with BatCoV RaTG13 M pro and ~96% with the previous SARS-CoV M pro . In contrast, sequence identity with MERS-CoV M pro is only ~50% (Fig. 2). Superimposition of the X-ray crystal structures of the main proteases of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV indicates a high degree of structural similarity and conservation of the active site (Fig. 3). This might prove valuable for the development of pan-coronaviral drugs and has already been employed for the development of SARS-CoV-2 M pro inhibitors that were based on previous compounds targeting the SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV main proteases. M pro is a cysteine protease with a catalytic dyad (cysteine and histidine) in its active centre (Fig. 3). While other cysteine and serine proteases contain a third catalytic residue, a buried water molecule occupies this place in the active site of M pro . 23,25,71 The proteolytic process is believed to follow a multi-step mechanism. After the cysteine side chain proton is abstracted by the histidine's imidazole, the resulting thiolate nucleophile attacks the amide bond of the substrate. The N-terminal peptide product is released by proton abstraction from histidine before the thioester is hydrolysed to release the C-terminal product and restore the catalytic dyad. 72,73 M pro (nsp5) autocleaves itself between nsp4 and nsp6, 74,75 before processing the overlapping polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab at 11 cleavage sites (Fig. 1). 29,63,64 While the M pro monomer is basically inactive, the homodimer is the primary active species with both protomers almost orthogonally aligned to each other (Fig. 4a). 68,72 Each protomer consists of three domains (Fig. 4b). In case of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, domains I and II comprise residues 8-101 and 102-184, respectively, and include an antiparallel β-barrel with similarities to trypsin-like serine proteases. 57 Domain II is connected to Domain III (residues 201-306) via a longer loop region (residues 185-200). Domain III is characterised by a cluster of five αhelices. 57,59,[76][77][78][79] The protomers bind to each other via an N-terminal finger (residues 1-7) located between domains II and III, which is involved in the formation of the substrate-binding site in a cleft between domains I and II. 57,59,[76][77][78] It is known that the mutations Ser284Ala, Thr285Ala and Ile286Ala in SARS-CoV M pro result in a 3.6-fold increase in catalytic activity. 80 Two similar mutations (Thr285Ala and Ile286Leu) are present in SARS-CoV-2 M pro , explaining higher activity observed for SARS-CoV-2 M pro compared to SARS-CoV M pro . 59 The Thr285Ala mutation is believed to bring domain III of both protomers closer to each other.Early homology models of SARS-CoV-2 M pro indicated close structural relation to other coronaviral main proteases. 69 Amino acid sequence alignments reveal ~99% identity with BatCoV RaTG13 M pro and ~96% with the previous SARS-CoV M pro .

        <p>According to the nomenclature introduced by Schechter and Berger, 81 M pro mainly recognises substrate residues ranging from P4 to P1'. 82 Prime site recognition beyond P1' is not conserved (Fig. 5). Specificity is mostly determined by P1, P2 and P1', which show the highest degree of conservation amongst the cleavage sites. 63 Glutamine in P1 is highly conserved in all polyprotein cleavage sites of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 5). In P2 more hydrophobic amino acids are tolerated with a clear preference for leucine. P1' tolerates small residues like serine or alanine. 56,60,61,[83][84][85] Analysis of all polyprotein cleavage sites processed by M pro for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 illustrates very similar substrate recognition profiles amongst these viruses (Fig. 5). Particularly important is the pronounced preference for glutamine in P1, strongly informing inhibitor design. 84 Since no human host-cell proteases with similar specificity are reported, reduced off-target effects are assumed for peptidomimetic inhibitors. 60,61 WebLogo. 86 The catalytic dyad of M pro is located in a cleft between domains I and II (Fig. 4b). 23,71 Despite the minor mutation S46A in close proximity, the active sites of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 M pro are highly conserved. The influence of the S46A mutation on shape, size, flexibility and plasticity of the active site and its relevance for inhibitor design is under debate. 87,88 As the monomer of M pro is principally regarded as inactive, the dimerization interface offers an alternative target site for drug discovery. 68,72 Although strong dimerization inhibitors are yet unavailable, the principle has been proven with the N-terminal octapeptide of SARS-CoV M pro . 89According to the nomenclature introduced by Schechter and Berger, 81 M pro mainly recognises substrate residues ranging from P4 to P1'. 82 Prime site recognition beyond P1' is not conserved (Fig. 5).

        <p>Inhibitors of SARS-CoV M pro have been reviewed comprehensively by Pillaiyar et al. in 2016. 72 MERS-CoV inhibitors have been reviewed by Liang et al. in 2018. 90 Peptidomimetics and small molecules have been reported with affinities in the micro-to nanomolar range. They often depend on warhead-based design strategies, employing different reactive groups to covalently attack the catalytic cysteine residue. Warheads utilised include Michael acceptors, aldehydes, epoxy ketones and other ketones. 72 Although SARS-CoV-2 emerged only very recently, several inhibitors have already been identified and successfully co-crystallised with M pro (Fig. 6). 59,79,91 They are often derived from previous campaigns which targeted the main proteases of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV and contain cysteine-targeting warheads (Fig. 6). The first reported inhibitors were covalently binding peptidomimetics (1-3) addressing the major substrate-recognition motif from P1' to P3. 59 They all comprise an a-ketoamide functionality that forms a hemithioacetal with Cys145. a-Ketoamides are already used as viral serine protease warheads in the approved HCV drugs telaprevir and boceprevir. 62 Compound 1 has previously been investigated as a broad-spectrum corona-and enteroviral protease inhibitor. 60 Like many other M pro inhibitors, the P1 side chains of 1-3 employ a g-lactam as a glutamine mimetic. P2 comprises hydrophobic cyclohexyl (1, 2) or smaller cyclopropyl (3) groups as leucine mimetics and P1' contains cyclopropyl (2) or benzylic (1, 3) residues.Inhibitors of SARS-CoV M pro have been reviewed comprehensively by Pillaiyar et al. in 2016. 72 MERS-CoV inhibitors have been reviewed by Liang et al. in 2018. 90 Peptidomimetics and small molecules have been reported with affinities in the micro-to nanomolar range.

        <p>Compounds 5 and 6 are the strongest SARS-CoV-2 M pro inhibitors with inhibition constants in the two-digit nanomolar range. These small peptidomimetics feature an indole moiety at the N-terminus (P3) and a C-terminal aldehyde warhead which binds covalently to Cys145, as proven by X-ray crystallography (Fig. 6c). 91 Similar peptide-aldehydes have previously been explored as inhibitors of SARS-CoV M pro . 93,94 Compound 5 and the previously investigated a-ketoamides 1 and 2 are structurally identical in P1 and P2; however, 5 inhibits one order of magnitude stronger, which is likely caused by the increased electrophilicity of the aldehyde warhead compared to the more drug-like a-ketoamide. Despite, the high reactivity of the aldehyde function, compounds 5 and 6 displayed sub-micromolar antiviral activity in Vero cells (Fig. 7). In agreement with compound 3, the in vitro activity of 5 and 6 was one order of magnitude weaker than the direct M pro inhibition in the enzymatic assay. Notably, 5 exhibited only low toxicity in animal models despite its aldehyde warhead. 91 A high-throughput screening campaign of a library of approved drugs and clinical candidates revealed six small molecules, ebselen, disulfiram, carmofur, tideglusib, shikonin and PX-12, as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M pro (Fig. 7). 79 Mass spectrometry experiments showed that ebselen, carmofur and PX-12 covalently modify Cys145. Small covalent modifiers like these may bind unspecifically, a characteristic associated with pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS). 95 Ebselen showed antiviral activity in Vero cells in the low micromolar range. In case of carmofur, a crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 M pro revealed transfer of the hexylurea side chain to Cys145, forming a hexylcarbamothioate interacting with S2 (PDB: 7BUY). 96 Crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 M pro in complex with X77 and baicalein (Fig. 7)Compounds 5 and 6 are the strongest SARS-CoV-2 M pro inhibitors with inhibition constants in the two-digit nanomolar range.

In agreement with compound 3, the in vitro activity of 5 and 6 was one order of magnitude weaker than the direct M pro inhibition in the enzymatic assay. Notably, 5 exhibited only low toxicity in animal models despite its aldehyde warhead. 91 A high-throughput screening campaign of a library of approved drugs and clinical candidates revealed six small molecules, ebselen, disulfiram, carmofur, tideglusib, shikonin and PX-12, as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M pro (Fig. 7). 79 Mass spectrometry experiments showed that ebselen, carmofur and PX-12 covalently modify Cys145. Small covalent modifiers like these may bind unspecifically, a characteristic associated with pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS). 95 Ebselen showed antiviral activity in Vero cells in the low micromolar range. In case of carmofur, a crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 M pro revealed transfer of the hexylurea side chain to Cys145, forming a hexylcarbamothioate interacting with S2 (PDB: 7BUY). 96 Crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 M pro in complex with X77 and baicalein (Fig. 7)</p>

        <p>While this manuscript was under peer-review, a study assessing known protease inhibitors for their anti-SARS-CoV-2 M pro activity was published. 102 Amongst the compounds that displayed M pro inhibition and reduction of cytopathic effect were the α-ketoamides boceprevir (Ki = 1.18 μΜ, EC50 = 1.31 μM) and calpain inhibitor XII (Ki = 0.13 Μm, EC50 = 0.49 μM), the peptide-aldehyde calpain inhibitor II (Ki = 0.40 Μm, EC50 = 2.07 μM) and the sulfonate-featured peptide GC-376 (k2/Ki = 40,800 M -1 s -1 , EC50 = 3.37 μM). A crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 M pro in complex with GC-376 was also reported (PDB: 6WTT).While this manuscript was under peer-review, a study assessing known protease inhibitors for their anti-SARS-CoV-2 M pro activity was published. 102 Amongst the compounds that displayed M pro inhibition and reduction of cytopathic effect were the α-ketoamides boceprevir (Ki = 1.18 μΜ, EC50 = 1.31 μM) and calpain inhibitor XII (Ki = 0.13 Μm, EC50 = 0.49 μM), the peptide-aldehyde calpain inhibitor II (Ki = 0.40 Μm, EC50 = 2.07 μM) and the sulfonate-featured peptide GC-376 (k2/Ki = 40,800 M -1 s -1 , EC50 = 3.37 μM).

        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic poses a major challenge to mankind. In view of the magnitude of the current global crisis, numerous attempts to develop vaccines and antiviral treatments are Repurposing of known drugs can provide an accelerated route to approval, which is likely the only option to address the current COVID-19 crisis. Small molecules like ebselen or carmofur are M pro inhibitors with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in cells; 79 however, their thiol reactivity might prove challenging. Repurposing approved protease inhibitors is an alternative approach. 102 Attempts to repurpose the approved combination of HIV protease inhibitors, ritonavir and lopinavir, was unsuccessful in clinical studies, which is not entirely unexpected, given the differences between the proteases of HIV and SARS-CoV-2. 107 It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 is not the last human coronavirus emerging from animals.The COVID-19 pandemic poses a major challenge to mankind.

        <p>It is therefore important to closely monitor virus populations to early understand their replication mechanism and investigate druggable targets. A sharp decline in research funding had been noted a few years after the first SARS epidemic. 61 Given the long-term nature of drug discovery projects, this has proven disastrous with respect to the current crisis. Now is the best time to progress protease inhibitors to anti-coronaviral drugs.It is therefore important to closely monitor virus populations to early understand their replication mechanism and investigate druggable targets.
