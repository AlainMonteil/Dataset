        <p>Although sudden cardiac death (SCD) is one of the most important modes of death in Western countries, pathologists and public health physicians have not given this problem the attention it deserves. New methods of preventing potentially fatal arrhythmias have been developed and the accurate diagnosis of the causes of SCD is now of particular importance. Pathologists are responsible for determining the precise cause and mechanism of sudden death but there is still considerable variation in the way in which they approach this increasingly complex task.

        <p>The present document is an update of the 2008 Guidelines for autopsy investigation of sudden cardiac death (SCD) developed by the Association for European Cardiovascular Pathology (AECVP) [1]. The update is timely in light of the new developments and increased availability of diagnostic tools at post-mortem and the growing awareness that a significant proportion of SCD, particularly at young age, are due to heredo-familial diseases. The writing committee is composed of clinical and forensic pathologists whose collective interests and experience cover the full range of disorders causing SCD. An extensive literature survey was conducted and all members of the writing committee approved the guidelines.The present document is an update of the 2008 Guidelines for autopsy investigation of sudden cardiac death (SCD) developed by the Association for European Cardiovascular Pathology (AECVP) [1].

        <p>Sudden death (SD) is often the first clinical manifestation of an underlying disease in previously asymptomatic, apparently "healthy" subjects. In this setting, autopsy represents the first, and only, opportunity to establish and register an accurate cause of death. In recent decades, there has been a substantial worldwide decrease in autopsy rates. As a result, important information may not reach national health registries and essential investigations and preventative care may not be implemented [2][3][4].Sudden death (SD) is often the first clinical manifestation of an underlying disease in previously asymptomatic, apparently "healthy" subjects.

        <p>The major difficulties in interpreting epidemiological data are the lack of standardization in death certificate coding and the variability in the definition of SD and SCD. SCD has been defined as "a natural, unexpected fatal event occurring within one hour from the onset of symptoms in an apparently healthy subject or in one whose disease was not so severe as to predict an abrupt outcome" [5]. This is a good description of many witnessed deaths in the community or emergency departments. It is less satisfactory in pathological practice, especially forensic practice, where autopsies may be requested on patients whose deaths were not witnessed, occurred during sleep, or at an unknown time before their bodies were discovered. Under these circumstances, it is probably reasonable to assume that death was sudden if the deceased was known to be in good health 24 h before death occurred [6]. Furthermore, for practical purposes, a death can also be classified as sudden if a patient was resuscitated after a cardiac arrest, survived on life support for a limited period, and then died due to irreversible brain damage.The major difficulties in interpreting epidemiological data are the lack of standardization in death certificate coding and the variability in the definition of SD and SCD.

        <p>Other definitions commonly used by cardiologists include sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (SADS) when both autopsy and toxicology investigations are inconclusive, the heart is structurally normal at gross and histological examination, and non-cardiac etiologies are excluded (in infants it is called sudden infant death syndrome, SIDS). Sudden unexplained death syndrome (SUDS) is used when death is without an apparent cause and an autopsy has not been performed (in infants it is called sudden unexplained death in infancy, SUDI) [7]. However, clear contradictions arise when comparing the meaning of these terms with that accepted in common forensic practice, where the death is considered as unexplained only by exclusion, i.e., after adequate post-mortem investigation including autopsy, death scene investigation, and the evaluation of the medical history of the victim and his/her family and of the circumstances of death.Other definitions commonly used by cardiologists include sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (SADS) when both autopsy and toxicology investigations are inconclusive, the heart is structurally normal at gross and histological examination, and non-cardiac etiologies are excluded (in infants it is called sudden infant death syndrome, SIDS).

        <p>Worldwide cardiovascular diseases are considered to be responsible for approximately 17 million deaths every year and about 25% are SCD [8]. A recent systematic review of publications on the incidence of SCD in the USA demonstrated that very few studies used primary data, that is data collected directly from first-hand experience. In addition, definitions of SCD and cardiac arrest are not standardized across the medical community [9]. The incidence of SCD increases dramatically with age, in parallel with the age-related increase of coronary heart disease. In adolescents and young adults (&lt;35 years), the approximate incidence is 0.01 per 1000 per year and cardiomyopathies, myocarditis, premature coronary artery disease, congenital coronary artery anomalies, and channelopathies play a major causative role [10][11][12]. The incidence of SCD then increases, reaching about 1 per 1000 per year in the subjects 35-40 years, 2 per 1000 per year by 60 years, and 200 per 1000 per year in the elderly [13,14]. Of course, the distribution of risk varies according to clinical and population profiles. The overall estimate in the population is in the range of 300,000-350,000 SCDs per year in the USA [15,16]. Event rates in Europe are similar to those in the USA [17], but with significant geographic variations. The risk increases in higher-risk subgroups. For instance, the SCD incidence is 0.1-0.2 per 1000 per year in subjects with a high coronary risk profile, 0.5 per 1000 per year in those with a prior coronary event, 1.5 per 1000 per year in those with congestive heart failure and ejection fraction (EF) &lt; 35%, and 2.5 per 1000 per year in cardiac arrest survivors. A combination of prior myocardial infarction, low EF and ventricular tachycardia, is associated with a SCD risk of nearly 3.5 per 1000 per year [18] . However, nearly two third of SCDs occur as the first clinical manifestation of cardiac disease or, in the setting of known cardiac disease, in the absence of risk predictors.Worldwide cardiovascular diseases are considered to be responsible for approximately 17 million deaths every year and about 25% are SCD [8].

        <p>Pathologists are responsible for establishing the precise cause of SD but there is considerable variation in the way in which they approach this increasingly complex task. A variety of book chapters, professional guidelines, and articles have described how pathologists should investigate SD. However, there is little consistency between centers, even in individual countries. We describe the minimum standard that is required in the routine autopsy practice for the adequate assessment of SCD in the general population, excluding SIDS.Pathologists are responsible for establishing the precise cause of SD but there is considerable variation in the way in which they approach this increasingly complex task.

        <p>Autopsies in SD cases are generally performed in two distinct settings, the clinical autopsy and the forensic autopsy. The clinical autopsy is performed at the request of the physician of the deceased or even the family in some countries depending on the national law. In cases of SD, the goal of the clinical autopsy is to determine whether death was due to cardiac disease or one of the many noncardiac causes. The clinical autopsy generally includes histology. Despite important advances over the last 10 years, ancillary examinations, such as toxicology, microbiology, and sampling for genetics are, all too often, not adequately performed. The forensic autopsy is performed in the case of unexpected, unexplained, or alleged unnatural deaths. A forensic autopsy may be requested by a magistrate, public prosecutor, official death investigator, coroner, or the police to assist in determining the cause and manner of death. Considerable variations exist regarding the legal aspects of authorization and consent in different countries, even though the norm for the harmonization of medico-legal autopsies was established by the European Union in 1999 [19].Autopsies in SD cases are generally performed in two distinct settings, the clinical autopsy and the forensic autopsy.

Check coronary arteries: a) examine the size, shape, position, number, and patency of the coronary ostia (Fig. 1); b) assess the size, course, and "dominance" of the major epicardial arteries; c) make multiple transverse cuts at 3-mm intervals along the course of the main epicardial arteries, including branches such as the diagonal and obtuse marginal, and check patency (Fig. 2a,b); d) heavily calcified coronary arteries should be removed intact, decalcified, and opened transversely; sometimes, they can be examined in situ with transverse sections made with sharp scissors; e) coronary artery segments containing a metallic stent should be referred intact to laboratories with facilities for resin embedding. This permits sectioning of the arterial wall with the stent in situ, preserving their anatomic relationships [27]. In the early hours or days, after implantation, stents can be opened longitudinally, removed, and checked for thrombus. As an alternative, a scalpel can be used to cut down onto the stented vessel to inspect the stent lumen; thrombus filling the lumen can be removed for standard histology.

Discussion with the surgeon and/or interventional cardiologist before, or even during the autopsy, is again therefore of the utmost importance [31]. SD after surgery for complex congenital heart disease, including grown-up congenital heart disease, is an increasingly common event.

        <p>Angiographic methods provide detailed views of the distribution pattern of epicardial coronary arteries, information on extent and location of arterial stenoses and obstructions, and specifically, the patency of stents and bypass grafts [33,34]. Plain X-ray image and coronary angiography practiced on isolated hearts are easy and more accessible methods than whole body imaging and additional post-mortem coronary angiograms can be made immediately after removal of the heart using a small cabinet system [33]. Whole body imaging by PMCT and post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging (PMMR), with or without angiography, are increasingly used, especially in forensic practice. In addition, religious objections to invasive autopsies have led to a demand for minimally invasive radiological methods, with or without post-mortem biopsy of selected organs. There are advantages and a b disadvantages to different whole body imaging methods, which are related to the logistics, costs, and image quality. Some reports suggest that in natural deaths these methods are less accurate than a standard autopsy, especially in cardiovascular deaths [35][36][37][38]. However, PMCT angiography does allow the evaluation of vessels, including coronary arteries [34,39,40]. PMMR is currently available in only a few academic centers. Myocardial abnormalities can be visualized but the images may be modified by post-mortem changes in heart muscle [41,42]. At present, the AECVP task force does not recommend the routine use of post-mortem imaging in the investigation of SD, but recognizes the added value in specific causes of death.Angiographic methods provide detailed views of the distribution pattern of epicardial coronary arteries, information on extent and location of arterial stenoses and obstructions, and specifically, the patency of stents and bypass grafts [33,34].

        <p>Additional laboratory analyses as toxicology, chemistry, microbiology, and genetic testing may be required at the time of autopsy, or at a later stage. National and international recommendations for forensic autopsy sampling and subsequent analyses should be applied [see Table 1]. In the absence of suitable on-site facilities, stored material should be sent to specialized local or regional centers. National legal and ethical aspects must be considered, in particular for post-mortem genetic testing.Additional laboratory analyses as toxicology, chemistry, microbiology, and genetic testing may be required at the time of autopsy, or at a later stage.

        <p>In all cases of SD, even if the heart is found to be abnormal at macroscopic and/or microscopic examination, the possibility that an illicit drug or a prescribed drug may have triggered the death, acting as additional factor to the anatomical substrate, should be carefully considered [43]. Many prescribed drugs or illicit substances have acute or long-term cardiovascular toxicity [44,45]. Some prescribed drugs, such as antipsychotics, can modify the QT intervals or provoke myocarditis. Genetic factors play a role in the individual response to some medications and gene-drug interaction should be considered, especially with QT interval-acting drugs [46]. Illicit drugs, especially cocaine, have well described acute and chronic effects on the cardiovascular system [47][48][49]. However, many other recreational drugs can be involved in SD and novel "designer" drugs are continually appearing on the streets. As some of these cannot be detected by routine assays, close collaboration with toxicologists is necessary [50].In all cases of SD, even if the heart is found to be abnormal at macroscopic and/or microscopic examination, the possibility that an illicit drug or a prescribed drug may have triggered the death, acting as additional factor to the anatomical substrate, should be carefully considered [43].

        <p>Myocarditis is a well-recognized cause of SCD, especially in the young. The cause can be infective (mostly viral), toxic, allergic, drug induced, or immune. In lymphocytic myocarditis, molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on both myocardial tissue and blood are the gold standard for the diagnosis of viral myocarditis [54,55]. The viral genome load should be quantified, particularly for viruses such as PVB19, which is frequently present as an innocent bystander [56]. Systemic sepsis and organ infection, including endocarditis, are uncommon, but well-recognized causes of SD. Cultures of blood, cerebrospinal fluid, spleen, or cardiac vegetation should be considered [57].Myocarditis is a well-recognized cause of SCD, especially in the young.

        <p>Many cardiovascular diseases causing SCD have a genetic background. Some are associated with well-defined structural abnormalities but in others, the heart may be macroscopically and microscopically normal. The likelihood that a case of unexplained SCD is caused by an underlying inherited disorder has led to the emerging role of genetic testing of DNA obtained at autopsy (also called "molecular autopsy," but the term postmortem genetic testing is preferable) [55,58]. Thus, pathologists play an important role in the identification of families at risk, by reporting whether it is recommended to refer first-degree family members for clinical screening and/or to perform additional postmortem genetic testing with cascade genetic screening, based upon the autopsy findings [59][60][61][62]. In Table 2, diseases are listed in whom cardiological assessment of relatives is recommended according to international guidelines [58,59,[63][64][65][66][67][68][69][70][71][72][73][74][75]. Only a minority of these studies specifically gives recommendations for genetic testing in the DNA of the deceased probands. In particular, according to the ESC guidelines [7], targeted postmortem genetic analysis of potentially disease-causing genes should be considered in all SD victims in whom a specific inheritable channelopathy or cardiomyopathy is suspected (Class of recommendation IIa, level of evidence C). However, in most of European countries, post-mortem genetic testing is performed only if there is genetic counseling of family members. After genetic counseling, it can be decided to perform genetic testing of the deceased in the context of the family screening.Many cardiovascular diseases causing SCD have a genetic background.

As far as possible, this should relate the pathological findings to the clinical history, the circumstances of the death, to any investigation performed close to the time of the death and to the results of all laboratory analyses. In the majority of SCDs, a clear pathological cause can be identified, albeit with varying degrees of confidence. When the morphological findings, and the results of additional analyses, do not indicate a single specific diagnosis, the full range of possible differential diagnoses should be discussed. These should be ranked in order of probability [76,77] and whenever possible, the most likely underlying cause should be stated [78].Theautopsyreportshouldconcludewithaclearclinico-pathological summary of the major positive findings and their relationship to the cause of death (epicrisis).

        <p>It is important to accept that different degrees of certainty exist in defining the cause-effect relationship between the cardiovascular findings and the SD event. Table 3 lists the commonest substrates of SCD, classifying each as certain, highly probable, or uncertain. In the probable, and especially the uncertain categories, each case should be considered on its individual merits. The clinical history, the circumstances of death, and the results of ancillary analyses may influence the decision-making process.It is important to accept that different degrees of certainty exist in defining the cause-effect relationship between the cardiovascular findings and the SD event.

        <p>Finally, there are myocardial diseases in which the border between physiological and pathological changes is poorly defined. Some of these diagnostic gray zones are described in Table 4 [64,[79][80][81]. In everyday practice, pathologists should make a detailed macroscopic and microscopic description of their findings, without implying a cause and effect relationship. If there is real doubt as to whether the changes are physiological or pathological, an expert opinion should be sought.Finally, there are myocardial diseases in which the border between physiological and pathological changes is poorly defined.

        <p>The clinical history, the autopsy findings, and the results of all ancillary examinations must be considered together when estimating the certainty of a cause of death. Interpretation of results of toxicology can be difficult. Quantification of drug levels, rather than their simple identification, is essential. Specific expertise may be necessary to state whether the amount of a particular drug is within the therapeutic range or potentially or definitely toxic. The information obtained from toxicological analyses depends not only on the presence of the substance in the body but also on analytical methods used. These include screening procedures, confirmation procedures, and specific methods. Many analytical pitfalls, especially for screening procedures by immunoassay, should be considered [82]. Moreover, substantial changes can occur in blood drug levels between the time of death and the autopsy. These changes are not easily identifiable by post-mortem sampling and toxicological analyses. They are related to drug degradation, neo-formation, artefactual formation, post-mortem redistribution, and individual pharmacogenomics [46]. The interpretation of post-mortem chemistry is limited by the lack of knowledge on defined reference ranges in life, by the effects of autolysis and other post-mortem changes and time interval between death and sampling [51,53]. Finally, there are deaths that remain unexplained after careful macroscopic, microscopic, and laboratory analyses (referred as SADS by the clinicians) [83][84][85]. We strongly suspect that the numbers of these unexplained deaths have been underestimated in the past and that there are many borderline cases. There is increasing evidence that SCD in these instances might be due to inherited ion channel disorders, which produce well-defined abnormalities in a basal or effort ECG. In this setting, the availability of ECG tracings may be crucial for the diagnosis and molecular studies are essential. First-degree relatives should be referred to a department with specific expertise in inherited cardiac conditions for clinical screening and, when indicated, subsequent genetic analysis. High-throughput approaches, such as massive parallel or next-generation sequencing, enable rapid analysis of many genes at low cost and with a higher success rate than with Sanger technology. In a SCD victim, particularly in the absence of a clear phenotype, the mere identification of a genetic defect is not sufficient to establish a diagnosis and state the cause of death [86]. A multidisciplinary approach is essential. Genetic information should always be interpreted in the clinical context of the deceased and his/her family and the autopsy findings [61,87].The clinical history, the autopsy findings, and the results of all ancillary examinations must be considered together when estimating the certainty of a cause of death.
