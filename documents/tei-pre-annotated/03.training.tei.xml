        <p>1. Introduction 1 Adresse pour le courrier électronique : gilles.olive@eicvn.be It is well established that today, personal computers are part of our life either at home, at work or at school. As the computer power increases, the software becomes harder and harder, requiring more time for learning or for obtaining a result. For example, the use of 
            <rs type="software">Gaussian</rs> [1] , a quantum calculation package, the input creation and more, the calculation requires a long time. Moreover, 
            <rs type="software">Gaussian</rs> is expensive. Some other software like 
            <rs type="software">Tinker</rs> [2] , 
            <rs type="software">Firefly</rs> [3] or 
            <rs type="software">Facio</rs> [4] are free of charge but are more difficult to use even if their authors take the users' wishes into account.

        <p>Pietri et al. carried out a very nice work to find the empirical equations for calculating the pKa or the chemical shift in 31 P NMR of amino phosphonate. [5][6][7][8][9][10][11] Collecting the data (more than 50 points) was very long and needed a great patience. The equations were recalculated several times and improved as new compounds were available. The equations were determined by linear regression from experimental data by using the Program 
            <rs type="software">Courbe</rs> developed by 
            <rs type="creator">Blaive</rs>. [12] The equation for pKa is (Equation 1) pKa = a0 + (∑ai.ni) + agem.ngem Eq. 1

        <p>The screen is divided into two unequal parts (Figure 1), the top is used to choose the calculation to be performed. The About button will give the version (3.05 yet) and how to cite this software. Figure 1 shows the screen for pKa calculations. The left part (the biggest one) is used for the introduction of the groups. Seven or nine groups are available according to references [6] and [8] . In the first reference two groups (CH2OH and COOMe) were not present: choosing one of them will prevent the calculation of the first set of data coefficient. An important point is that the two sets of data were kept because the second one (on 39 compounds [8] ) is not always better than the first one (on 20 compounds [6] ).

        <p>The value of the chemical shift in the deutareted chloroform was determined statically by the author and was found to be the chemical shift value in the basic medium multiplied by 1.02 if the basic chemical shift is positive or divided by the same value if it is negative (Figure 2). In 2009, the group of Eric Oldfield, in a nice work, found a correlation between the structure and the thermodynamics data of bisphosphonate binding to human bone. [13] The thermodynamics data calculated are the free energy, the enthalpy and the entropy. The equation used is similar to that of calculating the pKa and is a linear combination of variables (on 12 compounds but 18 vectors) (Equation 3):The value of the chemical shift in the deutareted chloroform was determined statically by the author and was found to be the chemical shift value in the basic medium multiplied by 1.02 if the basic chemical shift is positive or divided by the same value if it is negative (Figure 2).

        <p>the total free energy of binding is a linear combination of the free energy values for ammonium, phosphonate group number 1, phosphonate group number 2 with an 1-hydroxy group and a general hydrophobic side-chain (hydrogen or phenyl group). As the second phosphonate group that binds to human site B has always an 1-OH group, their contribution was grouped to one only. The equations for enthalpies and for temperature multiplied by entropy are similar to the free energy one. The figure 3 shows how to input the data: just put the number of each group present and the calculations are performed instantly. For the ammonium group, the protonation at pH 7 must be taken and a value of 0.33 and 0.03 respectively for imidazoliums and pyridiniums group has to be mentioned.

        <p>At present, this software is for education only ; at the beginning it was only in French and only six oils are included in the viscosity module. GCS was in French because one of the most cited remarks on Internet forums was that no soap calculator exists in French but most of time in English. The second remark was that the existing soap calculator needed always an Internet access. GCS will soon be usable for research, too. First, we translated it and it is now multi-language as can be seen in figure 4: the proposed languages for all modules are now French, English, Spanish and Dutch (other languages are welcome) 5 . Secondarily we found publications with data set for new oils and new equations for viscosity [14,15] and an HLB calculator using the Davie's group number will be included [16][17][18][19][20] . Today, this is the 2.08 version of GCS.At present, this software is for education only ; at the beginning it was only in French and only six oils are included in the viscosity module.

        <p>Soaps are salts of fatty acids. Making soap is easy. It consists in putting together a fat and an alkali and to boil the mixture for a few hours. Chemically the oils are triglyceride, exactly they are triesters. The action of the alkali is an hydrolysis of the esters to give glycerol (propan-1,2,3-triol) and the salt of fatty acids. It is well known that the quantity of alkali needed for the reaction can be calculated by the Saponification Index (IS in French) or the Saponification Value that is defined as the number of mg of potassium hydroxide needed to neutralize free fatty acids and to hydrolyze the fatty esters in one gram of fat. So this is the total of potassium hydroxide that must be used to make soap with no fatty excess ; it is simple, thanks to the ratio of molecular weight, to know the amount of soda or sodium carbonate. What is very important in such software is the size of the database of saponification index. Thanks to Internet we have found a database with 89 fats. [21] Of course, verifications with some publications were carried out to avoid any mistakes.Soaps are salts of fatty acids. Making soap is easy.

            <rs type="software">GDA</rs> is the most important software of this package. The screen is divided in three parts (Figure 7): the top is the menu, the middle is the module itself and the bottom can be considered as a (tool) bar to choose which module to use. Each module has its own About form and 
            <rs type="software">GDA</rs> About form also summarizes all information. The desired module is obtained either by pressing the corresponding button, selecting it in the menu (called Module and always present) or using a key combination (see in the Module menu). As the number of modules increases, since the build 4.6 of the version 1.16, some less useful modules are accessible by selecting them in the combo box and pressing the "&lt;-Go to module" button. An °at the end of the name's module indicates that it needs a special file ; a flag will be up to avoid any problem. Most of time, in a graphical area, a click with the mouse left button will give the coordinates of the plot, according to the units in use.
        </p>
        <p>This is the first one and the more important module of GDA (Figure 7). With this one, the user can either enter the data, either load data directly from apparatus file. The authors are attentive to the user wishes and are ready to introduce new files format to help users. Several parts are in the screen and the latter revolves around two Grids called respectively Grid 1 (or Major Grid) for the left one and Grid 2 (or Calculation Results Grid) for the right one. From the menu, it is possible to load or save files in several formats: GDA format (that is in fact Gabriel Statistique (.GAS)), ASCII Text file with a complete import module that can import almost all text files 8 , STA files which are an old format from the I.E.E.E Module of the homemade

            <rs type="creator">Microsoft</rs>
            <rs type="software">Excel</rs> ® . The Edition menu contains normal editing tools like inversion of columns, filling with or without increment a column, deleting or adding a cell, row 9 or column, sorting ascending or descending a column, searching maximum and minimum in each column, imposing a flag and removing some # into the data. The two last deserve more description. To avoid errors in the calculation that could crash the program, when files from apparatus are loaded (or for pH calculations), a flag is set and before launching the corresponding module, a test is carried out to prevent the user's mistake. Grid 2 is used to receive the result of some basic calculations: when a calculation is impossible (the inverse of zero or a logarithm of a negative value for example) to indicate this impossibilities to the user, four # are written in the corresponding cell. Those four # will prevent results of some modules and an option to remove them is implemented in the Edition menu. Between the two grids, the Transform panel ; at the top, the variable that will be changed is selected.
        </p>

This module, like the last described module, can either work from the first (X,Y) or from the second (X',Y') grid. When this module is called, two screens appear. The first is the graphical window (Figure 14) and the second is the equation panel (Figure 15). A second window is needed, due to the number of equations (more than 20), because we want to have the biggest graphical area to see and be able to choose the best correlation.

In this plot, as a cross, the data are drawn as well as the curves that are chosen in the equation panel (Figure 15).

[26][27][28] One of these drawbacks is that the classical least square technique "minimizes only the squared distance parallel to the y axis between the experimental points and the fitting line". [26] Moreover the x's values are not always free of errors or uncertainty. [26] Furthermore, in the CLS regression there is no symmetric treatment of the data x and y series preventing the transformation of a fit y over x in x over y. The best method to avoid these two drawbacks is the use of the orthogonal least square (OLS) technique which minimizes the sum of quadratic distances to the equation line.

        <p>Another drawback that the CLS suffers, is that this latter is sensible to outliers. [28] When a data point is out of range of the general trend of the data set, this will badly influence the results of CLS. [28] The example given in reference [28] using the following couples of data ((0, 0.0); (1, 1.1); (2, 2.0); (3, 3.1); (4, 3.8); (5, 10.0)) will give an idea of the problem (Figure 16). The resistance (or breakdown bound) is zero for CLS. The use of the median (which is the central value of an ordered data set) is exceptionally resistant to outliers. [28] In 1950, Theil proposed a resistant and easily implementable method which consists of collecting the slopes between all possible pairs (Equation 37) and find the median of these slopes.

        <p>Another method that has been implemented in GDA is a linear least square regression assuming a constant percent error. [27] In the CLS, it is assumed that the absolute error is constant, which means that the larger values of y influence too much the linear regression. The constant percent error method assumes that the percentage error is constant by minimizing the weighted squares of the deviation from the least squares lines. [27] With this method of analyze, the results between CLS and the constant percent error method are very close but the latter gives a closer fit to the theoretical linear regression. According to reference [27] , equations 39 and 40 are implemented in GDA but the calculation is only performed if no y's value is equal to zero.Another method that has been implemented in GDA is a linear least square regression assuming a constant percent error.

        <p>An explained variable is a variable on which the distance parallel to its axis is minimized.

When x is the explained variable, it is equivalent to a change of the axis x and y and the horizontal distances are used instead of the vertical ones. So the definition of x and y are inverted and equations 41 to 44 are those in use in GDA.

One of the ways is to calculate this value for a pressure of 5 mN.m -1 , the slope is calculated first according equation 93 and A0 from equations 94 and 95. In some cases a second transition occurs in the curve (At-At'). The algorithm used here is the same as above, for the second way of calculating the slope and A0, but only the slopes are calculated (equations 93 and 94). This is also the same for the last part of the curve (At-Ac).The first point discussed here is the search of A0.

        <p>It is important to find the exact inflexion. Therefore, first the user has to choose the first part (A05, A0Boundaries or At-At') of the curve by selecting the appropriate button, as the second part is always the curve At-Ac. The co-ordinates are found by equations 96 to 98. It could be useful to plot the compressibility or the elasticity as a function of the surface pressure or as a function of the logarithm of the area. Equations 99 and 100 respectively define exactly the elasticity and exactly the compressibility (A is the area of the film and π is the surface pressure) [37,38] , but are defined in GDA by equations 101 and 102: the elasticity corresponds to the slope at one point in the graphic pressure as a function of neperian logarithm of the area while the compressibility corresponds to the inverse of the slope at one point in the graphic pressure as a function of neperian logarithm of the area). The reader will remark that every part of the rheogram can be modeled independently. On the rheogram of the kefir (Figure 26), he can also see that the second part of the profile can be modeled with two models, the Herschel-Bulkley model suitable at high shear rate while the Casson model is more appropriate for low shear rate (black circles in Figure 26).It is important to find the exact inflexion.

        <p>Schematically the apparatus measures the fall of a drop. [37,39] One of the parameters that can be calculated from the curve γ as a function of the time (blue circle in the left part of the Figure 27) is the equilibrium tension, which expresses the maximum surface-active power that a surface-active agent can develop. From the absorption kinetics curves the equilibrium tension γe (or γ∞) can be extrapolated and can be considered as a tension for an infinite time. To estimate this tension, a variable change is needed, and the curve becomes the surface tension γ as a function of the inverse of the time square root ( t 1/ ) that becomes a straight line. The ordinate at the origin (which corresponds to an infinite time) found by the internal CLS subroutine will give directly the equilibrium tension (right and lower part of Figure 27).Schematically the apparatus measures the fall of a drop.

        <p>Fatty acid sugar esters are non-ionic, biodegradable, non toxic, non skin irritant, odourless and tasteless surfactants which allow their use in the food or the cosmetic industries. [41][42][43] In recent years, lipasecatalyzed synthesis of sugar esters has emerged as an interesting alternative of the chemical synthesis because of milder conditions using less toxic solvents. [44][45][46][47][48] The initial water content is important in the enzymatic reaction in several ways. Modeling the different parameters plays an important role for industrial processes. In this way, the author published a paper dealing with the influence of the initial water content on the conversion rate of the lauric acid, that can be modelled by a Herschel-Bulkley threeparameter power law equation, in which the first coefficient is related to the experimental conditions if no water is present and the third (the exponent) corresponds to the "efficiency" of the water (for decreasing the conversion rate). [49] In this paper, the litterature data have been fitted too. In another publication dealing with the study of some parameters of the lipase-catalyzed reaction, the authors found that the influence of the reaction time can be modeled by a hyperbolic correlation. [50] Now, some useful equations will be given to demonstrate the power of GDA. All data are taken from the CRC Handbook of chemistry and physics. [51] The first equation concerns the pressure vapor of ice. The curve can be well fitted only by a polynomial with a degree of 6, given at equation 103 (the pressure is in Pascal while the temperature is in the range of 0 to -80 °C).
