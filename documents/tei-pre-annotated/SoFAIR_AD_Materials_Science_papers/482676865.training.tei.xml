        <p>The search for suitable materials for solid-state stationary storage of green hydrogen is pushing the implementation of efficient renewable energy systems. This involves rational design and modification of cheap alloys for effective storage in mild conditions of temperature and pressure. Among many intermetallic compounds described in the literature, TiFe-based systems have recently regained vivid interest as materials for practical applications since they are low-cost and they can be tuned to match required pressure and operation conditions. This work aims to provide a comprehensive review of publications involving chemical substitution in TiFe-based compounds for guiding compound design and materials selection in current and future hydrogen storage applications. Mono-and multisubstituted compounds modify TiFe thermodynamics and are beneficial for many hydrogenation properties. They will be reviewed and deeply discussed, with a focus on manganese substitution.The search for suitable materials for solid-state stationary storage of green hydrogen is pushing the implementation of efficient renewable energy systems.

        <p>If not consumed on-site, it can be transported by gas pipelines, trucks and ships. Finally, hydrogen can be used to feed fuel cells and generate electricity (and heat) on demand, releasing only water as a by-product and then closing the hydrogen cycle. Such an electricity-hydrogen-electricity conversion process is only sustainable if electricity is produced from renewable energies and cannot be directly injected in the grid, then it can be used later on with a fuel cell. Therefore, it is mandatory to add a storage step in the hydrogen chain for the time-management of hydrogen production and use. The intrinsic intermittency of most renewable energy sources makes unavoidable the implementation of efficient hydrogen storage systems.If not consumed on-site, it can be transported by gas pipelines, trucks and ships.

        <p>Efficient hydrogen storage can be achieved as dihydrogen molecules in high-pressure tanks (typically 350 or 700 bar) or in liquid state (at temperature lower than À252 1C [21 K]). [1][2][3] In addition, dihydrogen can be physically adsorbed in highsurface-area solids such as MOFs and activated carbons, typically at liquid nitrogen temperature (À196 1C [77 K]). [4][5][6][7][8] As an alternative, hydrogen molecules can be chemisorbed at the surface of solid compounds and diffused in atomic form to form hydrogen-containing compounds. [9][10][11] In some cases, after suitable activation, these compounds can reversibly absorb and desorb hydrogen close to normal conditions of pressure and temperature (i.e. 1 bar, 25 1C). [12][13][14][15][16] These materials are typically intermetallic compounds of general formula AB n , which are commonly named metallic hydrides, from the facts that both hydrogen-metal bonding and electronic conductivity have a metallic character. 17 A is an element that forms very stable metallic hydrides (e.g. rare earths and early transition metals) and B an element that only forms hydrides at very high pressure (e.g. late transition metals), as reported in Fig. 1. Their combination in stoichiometric ratio n = B/A allows for the formation of hydrides with intermediate stability. Representative intermetallic compounds suitable for hydrogen storage are LaNi 5 , CeNi 3 , TiMn 2 and TiFe for n = 5, 3, 2 and 1, respectively.Efficient hydrogen storage can be achieved as dihydrogen molecules in high-pressure tanks (typically 350 or 700 bar) or in liquid state (at temperature lower than À252 1C [21 K]).

        <p>Intermetallic compounds, being formed by heavy elements, offer modest mass storage capacities (i.e. 1-2 wt%). Hydrogen systems based on this technology have low gravimetric capacities, due to the weight of the reservoir and ancillary equipment. 3 When compared to classical molecular methods (5-6 wt% system basis, for both pressurized and liquid storage), their typical operation conditions (0-80 1C, 1-50 bar) guarantee higher safety conditions. This is a key property when hydrogen tanks must be installed close to domestic facilities or in confined space. Moreover, in the case of stationary applications, footprint instead of mass capacity is the most relevant performance indicator for the hydrogen storage system. The volumetric capacity of intermetallic compounds, i.e. 100-120 kg H 2 m À3 , is significantly higher than that of pressurized or liquid hydrogen: 39 (at 700 bar) and 70 kg H 2 m À3 , respectively. Furthermore, if the required tank is considered, the system volumetric density decreases significantly in the case of gas and liquid storage.Intermetallic compounds, being formed by heavy elements, offer modest mass storage capacities (i.e. 1-2 wt%).

        <p>Finally, yet importantly, intermetallic compounds are highly versatile materials as their operation temperature and pressure can be tuned at will, through suitable chemical substitutions of both A and B-type elements. As an example, the EU-funded HyCARE (Hydrogen CArrier for Renewable Energy storage) project, kicked off in January 2019, aims to develop a prototype large-scale hydrogen storage tank using a solid-state hydrogen carrier based on metal powder, operating at low pressure and temperature. 18,19 The project involves the production of almost 4 tons of metal powder, which will be placed in stainless steel containers. The thermal management of the plant will follow an innovative approach, making use of phase-change materials, significantly increasing the efficiency of the process. The aim is to store about 50 kg of hydrogen, which is a rather high quantity to be stored using this technique. Among many intermetallic compounds described in the literature for reversible hydrogen storage at room temperature (RT), TiFe-based systems have recently regained vivid interest. With a mass and volumetric capacity for the binary compound of 1.87 wt% and 105 kg H 2 m À3 , respectively, 20 the relevance of this system is mainly driven by its low cost, as compared to other intermetallics. However, in 2020, the European Union's (EU) has updated a list of 30 critical raw materials (CRMs), including titanium, considering their supply risk and economical importance. 21 In fact, titanium is widely exploited in aeronautics and medical applications, and its processing is making EU strongly dependent on import from main global producers (45% China, 22% Russia, 22% Japan). 21 Titanium End of Life Recycling Input Rate (EoL-RIR) is still limited (reported as 19%), 21 however, for applications as solid state hydrogen storage material, it could be recycled and reused effectively. Fig. 2 shows the CRMs, highlighted with an orange frame, which should thus be avoided or limited in alloy formulation towards large-scale production. Economic and supply indicators demonstrate that TiFe-based compounds are today target materials for practical applications, as shown by the implementation of R&amp;D projects worldwide, and especially in Japan. Intermetallic TiFe compound is promising for hydrogen storage tanks thank to its high volumetric density, good sorption kinetic, reversibility and because it can work in mild temperature and pressure conditions. Moreover, the hydrogenation thermodynamics of TiFe must be tuned to the required conditions of pressure and temperature imposed by each specific hydrogen storage application. As stated above, this can be achieved through suitable atomic substitutions. Indeed, titanium (Ti) and iron (Fe) can be substituted by other elements within certain homogeneity composition ranges, as reported in ternary phase diagrams. 22 Numerous mono and multi-substituted alloys have been explored in the literature as highlighted in green in Fig. 2. These substitutions have not only a noticeable effect on hydrogen sorption thermodynamics, but also on other key properties, such as alloy activation, reaction kinetics and cycle life.Finally, yet importantly, intermetallic compounds are highly versatile materials as their operation temperature and pressure can be tuned at will, through suitable chemical substitutions of both A and B-type elements.

        <p>Synthesis and crystal structures of TiFe and its hydrides TiFe exhibits a narrow homogeneity range, with the largest domain extending from 49.7 to 52.5 at% Ti at the eutectic Fig. 1 Periodic table of the elements showing the formation enthalpy of binary M-H metal hydrides, and the relative classification of A (in red) or B-type (in blue) M elements. Formation enthalpy was chosen from literature values. 60,206,207,234,235 temperature of 1085 1C. 25,26 . TiFe neighbouring phases are TiFe 2 , at the Fe-rich side, and b-Ti with a maximum solubility of 21 at% Fe, at the Ti-rich one. The hydrogen storage properties of this intermetallic compound are strictly linked to the composition and to the presence of secondary phases. In fact, due to the composition range in which TiFe phase can be formed, different properties can be observed for stoichiometric TiFe, Fe-rich (TiFe 1.012 ) or Ti-rich (TiFe 0.905 ) alloys. In addition, for Ti-rich alloys, the formation of b-Ti precipitates enables the hydrogen sorption at RT without activation. The TiFe heat of formation measured at 1167 1C is D f H = À31.0 kJ mol À1 . 27 TiFe is usually produced by melting the elements in a high temperature furnace. 28 As shown in the titanium-iron phase diagram (Fig. 3), the binary compound is obtained from the melt through a liquid + TiFe 2 -TiFe peritectic reaction at 1317 1C. As an alternative to melting, TiFe can also be obtained and processed by Severe Plastic Deformation (SPD) techniques, such as ball milling [29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45] and high pressure torsion [46][47][48][49][50] , as well as by self-ignition. [51][52][53] . SPD techniques lead to fresh and defective surfaces, that help alloy activation and also nanostructuration, but reducing nominal capacity. 41,54,55 The crystal structure of TiFe was first identified as CsCl-type (B2, space group Pm% 3m) by Laves et al. 56 . Further studies confirmed a cubic lattice, but contrary to bcc alloys, with distinct ordered atoms at the cube vertices, 1a sites (0,0,0), and its center, 1b sites (1/2,1/2,1/2). 57 The lattice constant of the stoichiometric compound is reported to be 2.9763 Å. 58 As stated before, the phase diagram exhibits a small homogeneity domain showing that the crystal structure of TiFe can accommodate some defects, such as partial substitution of Ti on the Fe sites. 59,60 Regarding the hydrides, four different phases have been reported for the TiFe-H system: a-solid solution, two monohydrides (b 1 and b 2 ) and g-dihydride. The solid solution retains the CsCl-type structure with minor changes in the lattice parameters. 61 Neutron diffraction experiments showed that H atoms occupy the octahedral 3d sites (1/2,0,0) along the cube edges with Ti 4 Fe 2 coordination, exhibiting a shorter distance from Fe atoms than Ti atoms (1.49 Å vs. 2.11 Å).

        <p>Materials Advances this feature is common for all phases in the TiFe-H system. [62][63][64][65] The maximum solubility of hydrogen in the a-solid solution is TiFeH 0.1 . Both b-phases crystallize in an orthorhombic structure, with minor structural differences between them except for hydrogen content, being TiFeH and TiFeH 1.4 for b 1 and b 2 , respectively. The most advanced studies by neutron diffraction suggest a P222 1 space group, 66 though Pmc2 1 cannot be completely ruled out. 67 In both monohydrides, H atoms partially occupy the octahedral sites H1 and H2, both with coordination Ti 4 Fe 2 , whereas Fe is found at site 2c (0,0.294,1/4) and Ti at site 2d (1/2,0.757,1/4). In the b 1 -phase, hydrogen shows occupancies of 88% and 12% for sites H1 and H2, respectively, whereas in b 2 -phase, it exhibits occupancies of 92% and 45%, respectively. Due to the difficulties in achieving the fully hydrogenated phase, and the broadening of diffraction peaks because of strains, the crystal structure of the g-phase has been subject of debate.

        <p>The main drawback for practical application of TiFe is probably the laborious treatment required after synthesis to promote the first hydrogen absorption. This treatment, usually named ''activation'', has been the subject of extensive work and controversy. The fact that TiFe does not readily absorb hydrogen at RT has been attributed to a native passivating layer, which forms at its surface. Indeed, TiFe is sensitive to air moisture and might react with it, forming oxides and hydroxides and then hindering the reaction with hydrogen. Consequently, one needs to apply harsh conditions to induce hydrogen penetration, to break the passivating surface layer or to avoid its formation at the alloy surface.The main drawback for practical application of TiFe is probably the laborious treatment required after synthesis to promote the first hydrogen absorption.

        <p>The first description of an activation process for TiFe was reported in the pioneering work of Reilly et al. 68 . The authors performed a sequence of absorption (up to 65 bar) and desorption (under vacuum) cycles at both high (400-450 1C) and room temperatures. Upon triggering hydrogen absorption/ desorption cycles, TiFe undergoes expansion and contraction, respectively, leading to volume changes and inducing the crack of the passivating layer. Since TiFe is a brittle material, fresh and clean TiFe surfaces are uncovered, where hydrogen can promptly be absorbed.The first description of an activation process for TiFe was reported in the pioneering work of Reilly et al. 68 .

        <p>Subsequently, several authors tried to identify the species formed during the oxidation and after activation, with the purpose of better understanding the mechanisms involved in this treatment. Pande et al. investigated the surface of oxidized TiFe by means of electron microscopy. 73 In the electron diffraction patterns, they found a phase claimed to be Ti 3 Fe 3 O, because this oxide was found unable to absorb hydrogen, making it a relevant candidate as passivating layer. 74 Bla ¨sius et al. studied the surface of activated TiFe by Mo ¨ssbauer spectroscopy, revealing the presence of small Fe clusters. 75 Because the signal of iron oxide was not detected, they inferred that only titanium was oxidized. Fe precipitates at the alloy surface were also found by other authors, and this free Fe was claimed to play a catalytic role in the dissociation of hydrogen. [76][77][78][79] However, Schober et al. studied the activation process by TEM and detected TiO 2 , TiFe 2 and suboxide TiFeO x as surface species. 80 They did not observe any elemental Fe and concluded that Fe clusters are only formed after severe oxygen contamination, following the TiFe 2 + O 2 -TiO 2 + 2Fe reaction. Hiebl et al. demonstrated that Ti 2 FeO x can absorb hydrogen 81 and other authors detected this compound during annealing of oxidized TiFe, 82,83 casting doubts on the catalytic effect of Fe. Later on, Schlapbach et al. identified an oxide layer mainly consisting of Fe III and Ti oIV on the surface of passivated TiFe. 84 After heating, they noticed the formation of Fe and TiO 2 , suggesting that TiO 2 is not an effective catalyst for the reaction, but rather a support for Fe clusters which might split hydrogen molecules.Subsequently, several authors tried to identify the species formed during the oxidation and after activation, with the purpose of better understanding the mechanisms involved in this treatment.

The authors prepared an equiatomic TiFe mixture, ball-milled for different duration times.

For an oxygen content below 3 at%, TiFe crystallized in the expected CsCl-type structure, whereas at higher oxygen content it became amorphous.

        <p>The first Pressure Composition Isotherm (PCI) curves of the TiFe-H system were monitored by Reilly et al. 68 . An example of absorption/desorption PCI isotherm at 40 1C is displayed in Fig. 4. Three different regions were observed during the absorption of hydrogen: a steep pressure increase at low H-content (oTiFeH 0.1 ), followed by two pressure plateaus located at P H 2 = 1.5 and B40 bar and extending from 0.1 o H f.u. À1 o 1, and 1 o H f.u. À1 o 2, respectively. The initial branch (0.1o H f.u. À1 ) was associated with the formation of the a-solid solution. The first plateau was attributed to the phase transition from the a-phase into the b-monohydrides. The second plateau, which is rather sloppy, was ascribed to the g-dihydride formation.The first Pressure Composition Isotherm (PCI) curves of the TiFe-H system were monitored by Reilly et al. 68 .

        <p>In Fig. 4, the length of the first plateau differs between absorption and desorption, suggesting different hydrogen contents for the intermediate b-phases. As mentioned above, Schefer et al. 62 proposed the existence of two different b 1 and b 2 phases, with similar crystal structures, except for small differences in the occupancy of the octahedral sites. The occurrence of these phases has been further investigated with volumetric measurements by Reidinger et al. 90 . On absorption, only b 2 -TiFeH 1.4 was observed, while during desorption both b 1 -TiFeH 1.0 and b 2 -TiFeH 1.4 were detected. Based on these results, they suggested that the formation of the b-phases is related to the presence of strains induced by the absorption of hydrogen. This assumption was later confirmed by Reilly et al. 91 , who, after activation, obtained a free-strain sample by annealing overnight at 800 1C under helium, and they achieved the full hydrogenation state in a single ag step, without detecting any b-phase during absorption. However, after the formation of the g-phase, which induces a volume expansion and thus lattice strains, b-phases appeared again during desorption. In addition, they demonstrated the strain effect on the overall performance of TiFe while cycling. They observed a decrease of the quantity of absorbed hydrogen with the increase of cycle number, mainly due to the disappearance of the upper g-phase plateau, which shifts to higher pressures. On the other hand, the lower b-phase plateau seems unaffected. After several cycles, the quantity of hydrogen reaches a steady state value, suggesting a saturation of the internal strain. By annealing the samples for 2 days at various temperatures (from 230 to 350 1C), thus reducing the strain, some capacity was recovered, observing again the formation of the g-phase.In Fig. 4, the length of the first plateau differs between absorption and desorption, suggesting different hydrogen contents for the intermediate b-phases.

        <p>Freshly activated TiFe exhibited two plateaus for the formation of b-monohydrides and g-dihydride, with large hysteresis between absorption and desorption. However, with the increase of cycle numbers, the hysteresis gap decreases, but the g-phase plateau shifted towards higher-pressure values, until it disappeared. Similar results were found also by Reilly et al., 91 who showed that the PCI curves change in shape during several cycles, until they stabilize becoming almost independent on the cycle number. The authors supposed that, until lattice strain and defects do not reach saturation, the isotherms keep changing. This implies that the disappearance of the g-phase is due to the presence of internal stress and defects, due to an expansion and shrinking of the unit cell during hydrogenation and dehydrogenation, respectively. Further analysis performed by Ahn et al. 101 confirmed the reduction of hydrogen stored due to the disappearance of g-dihydride because of stress. Moreover, they observed a decrease also in the hydrogenation rate with the number of cycles. The authors suggested that, besides lattice distortion, also the formation of stable hydrides (TiH x ) due to alloy disproportionation during cycling could be a cause of the degradation. Indeed, stable hydrides do not release hydrogen, and their formation hinders hydrogenation on the TiFe surface due to rearrangements of neighbour atoms and the introduction of lattice strain.Freshly activated TiFe exhibited two plateaus for the formation of b-monohydrides and g-dihydride, with large hysteresis between absorption and desorption.

        <p>Besides cycling-induced degradation, contaminants in the hydrogen gas such as H 2 O, O 2 , CO 2 and CO have a prominent influence. Adsorption of impurities at active sites on TiFe surface will prevent hydrogen molecules to dissociate during the chemisorption step. As demonstrated by Sandrock et al. 102 , this passivation is generally manifested as a decrease in the reaction rate or a reduction in the storage capacity. These authors have investigated the effect of H 2 containing 300 ppm of H 2 O, O 2 and CO on the cycling of TiFe. H 2 O and O 2 split on the surface, forming a thick passivating layer composed by complex oxides. The effect of this layer is similar in both cases, exhibiting a continuous decrease in the quantity of hydrogen stored during cycling. The main observed difference is that O 2 reacts faster than H 2 O at the surface. In both cases, TiFe could be partially reactivated cycling at moderate temperature (80 1C) with pure H 2 . On the other hand, CO has shown to be more detrimental than H 2 O and O 2 . It is adsorbed in less than one minute, completely deactivating TiFe in a few cycles. However, TiFe poisoned by CO was easily reactivated by simply cycling at room temperature under pure H 2 . Additional information was provided by Block et al., 103 who investigated also the effect of CO 2 , CH 4 and H 2 S in various concentrations. The presence of 10 vol% CH 4 showed a stable and slight decrease in the capacity and reaction rate of TiFe. Surprisingly, when pure H 2 was provided again, the active material exhibited a reaction rate even faster than before, restoring also its hydrogen absorption capacity. The authors suggested that CH 4 does not passivate TiFe, and the decrease during cycling was probably due to the lower H 2 partial pressure in presence of methane. In the presence of CO 2 there is a constant decrease in the storage capacity during cycling and, moreover, the absorption rate decreases with the increase of impurity concentration into H 2 . A concentration of 1 vol% CO 2 in the gas stream was enough to fully passivate TiFe after two cycles. The sample was reactivated by cycling with pure hydrogen at 127 1C. Introducing 0.2 vol% H 2 S did not affect the reaction rate, but it strongly reduced the quantity of hydrogen absorbed upon cycling, so that few cycles were enough to completely deactivate TiFe. Even performing intensive heat treatments, the authors were not able to reactivate the sample due to the presence of a stable sulphur layer on the surface of TiFe, which inhibited the absorption of hydrogen.Besides cycling-induced degradation, contaminants in the hydrogen gas such as H 2 O, O 2 , CO 2 and CO have a prominent influence.

        <p>From these results, it can be concluded that TiFe hydrogenation properties easily deteriorate in the presence of contaminants. To face this issue, two main strategies were suggested: the design and implementation of reactivation systems or the enhancement of TiFe resistance to poisoning. Resistance to passivation reaction might be induced by adding a secondary phase, but still no complete resistance to contamination has been reported in the literature for TiFe. Hence, leaks and gas purity must be carefully checked for long-cycling applications for hydrogen storage.From these results, it can be concluded that TiFe hydrogenation properties easily deteriorate in the presence of contaminants.

        <p>In the case of single elemental substitution, an empirical geometric model was proposed by Lundin et al. 105 and Achard et al. 106 , reporting that by enlarging the unit-cell volume of TiFe, interstitial holes size increases and plateau pressures in PCI curves shift to lower values. This empirical law, to which many intermetallic systems obey, can differ from that observed for some substitutions, therefore, electronic band structure should be considered and implemented with ab initio studies, as demonstrated by Jung et al. 104 Alkaline earths (Mg, Be) Magnesium (Mg, r Mg = 0.16013 nm, radius values reported from ref. 107, for comparison r Ti = 0.14615 nm and r Fe = 0.12412 nm) can be substituted up to 2 at% by ball milling, while up to 6 at% the precipitation of Fe as secondary phase is observed. 108 It induces an easier activation compared to pure TiFe, an enlargement of the cell parameter and a concomitant decrease of equilibrium pressure in the PCI, which presents a single plateau related to the formation of the monohydride. 108 So, in the case of Mg substitution, the formation of the g phase is suppressed thus reducing the reversible capacity of the material. 108 The substitution of Fe with beryllium (Be, r Be = 0.1128 nm), a smaller element with respect to Fe (r Fe = 0.12412 nm), up to 15 at%, evidences that geometrical factors alone fail to explain the variation of hydride stability. Although the TiFe unit-cell shrinks with Be substitution, the plateau pressures decrease as reported by Bruzzone et al. 109 . Furthermore, lower capacity but narrower hysteresis and sufficiently good kinetic were evidenced. 109 Besides, the thermodynamics are modified, evidencing higher values of DH introducing Be. 110 Early transition metals (Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta) Zirconium (Zr, r Zr = 0.16025 nm) substitution for Ti (r Ti = 0.14615 nm) has a positive effect on activation. 111,112 Following the geometric model, it increases the cell parameter of TiFe and decreases the plateau pressures. [113][114][115][116][117] However, a decrease of reversible capacity was observed and related to the enlarged solubility of hydrogen in the solid solution (a phase) at high Zr content. 113 Zr substitution leads to slopping plateaus, no variation in hysteresis and fast kinetics. 118 Jain et al. studied the effect of 4 wt% Zr addition to TiFe, which confirms the positive effect of this substitution for activation (no need of thermal treatment), fast kinetics, a good maximum capacity of 1.60 wt% at 20 bar and 40 1C, and a good resistance to air. 119 However, an increase in hysteresis was observed as well, in contrast with previous findings. 119 Mechanical treatment (i.e. ball milling and cold rolling) can easily recover hydrogen capacity of this material after air exposure. 120 Hafnium (Hf, r Hf = 0.15775 nm) can be introduced into TiFe up to 2 at%, causing an increase of the cell parameter and a subsequent decrease of plateau pressures. The formation of secondary phases have also been observed, improving activation (possible at room temperature and 20 bar) and kinetics, but slightly reducing the hydrogen capacity of the material. 121 Vanadium (V, r V = 0.1316 nm) can substitute both Ti and Fe in TiFe. 104,122 Furthermore, it has been reported that the addition of V to TiFe 0.90 decreases the total capacity of the material, but on the other hand it decreases hysteresis between absorption and desorption, even if slopped plateaus are observed. 123 . The addition of V levers the difference between the two plateaus introducing a smoothing effect towards a single plateau that has been widely discussed by Jung et al. combining DFT calculations and experiments. 104 They evidenced a stronger effect in lowering both plateau pressure when V substitutes Fe. While V substitution for Ti increases the first plateau pressure and decreases the second one. 104 However, V substitution does not improve kinetics, neither cycling stability or resistance to poisoning and oxidation. 124,125 Furthermore, it enlarges the cell parameter of the TiFe phase and promotes the formation of smaller crystallite sizes. 126 Niobium (Nb, r Nb = 0.1429 nm) substitution was studied by in situ X-ray diffraction in TiFe 0.90 Nb 0.10 , possibly substituting Ti. It evidenced the formation of b-Ti as secondary phase that starts absorbing hydrogen upon first hydrogenation, allowing easy activation at 22 1C and under 50 bar after 5000 s of incubation time. 87 The incubation time can be shorten by the combined substitution of Ti by Nb and the addition of Fe 2 O 3 .In the case of single elemental substitution, an empirical geometric model was proposed by Lundin et al. 105 and Achard et al. 106 , reporting that by enlarging the unit-cell volume of TiFe, interstitial holes size increases and plateau pressures in PCI curves shift to lower values.

Although the TiFe unit-cell shrinks with Be substitution, the plateau pressures decrease as reported by Bruzzone et al. 109 . Furthermore, lower capacity but narrower hysteresis and sufficiently good kinetic were evidenced. 109 Besides, the thermodynamics are modified, evidencing higher values of DH introducing Be. 110 Early transition metals (Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta) Zirconium (Zr, r Zr = 0.16025 nm) substitution for Ti (r Ti = 0.14615 nm) has a positive effect on activation. 111,112 Following the geometric model, it increases the cell parameter of TiFe and decreases the plateau pressures. [113][114][115][116][117] However, a decrease of reversible capacity was observed and related to the enlarged solubility of hydrogen in the solid solution (a phase) at high Zr content. 113 Zr substitution leads to slopping plateaus, no variation in hysteresis and fast kinetics. 118 Jain et al. studied the effect of 4 wt% Zr addition to TiFe, which confirms the positive effect of this substitution for activation (no need of thermal treatment), fast kinetics, a good maximum capacity of 1.60 wt% at 20 bar and 40 1C, and a good resistance to air. 119 However, an increase in hysteresis was observed as well, in contrast with previous findings. 119 Mechanical treatment (i.e. ball milling and cold rolling) can easily recover hydrogen capacity of this material after air exposure. 120 Hafnium (Hf, r Hf = 0.15775 nm) can be introduced into TiFe up to 2 at%, causing an increase of the cell parameter and a subsequent decrease of plateau pressures.

The addition of V levers the difference between the two plateaus introducing a smoothing effect towards a single plateau that has been widely discussed by Jung et al. combining DFT calculations and experiments. 104 They evidenced a stronger effect in lowering both plateau pressure when V substitutes Fe.

It evidenced the formation of b-Ti as secondary phase that starts absorbing hydrogen upon first hydrogenation, allowing easy activation at 22 1C and under 50 bar after 5000 s of incubation time. 87 The incubation time can be shorten by the combined substitution of Ti by Nb and the addition of Fe 2 O 3 .</p>
        <p>© This mixture results in the formation of secondary phases that improve the activation process (making the material more brittle). In addition, a slight shift of PCI curves towards lower plateau pressure values was observed. 127 The lower plateau pressure can be linked to the increasing lattice constant of TiFe introducing Nb. 128 Similar results have been observed recently in Nb-substituted materials by mechanical alloying, but evidencing the suppression of the g phase, thus decreasing the total capacity. 129 The suppression of the second plateau by ball milling has been justified by nanostructuration, defects and possibly oxygen contamination, influencing and deforming the coordination site for hydrogen. 129 Improved resistance to poisoning was mentioned as well. 129 Finally, Tantalum (Ta, r Ta = 0.1430 nm) substitution was recently studied by Kuziora et al. 130 . It enlarges the cell parameter of TiFe and lowers the equilibrium pressure in PCI curves. 130 Late transition metals (Cr, Mo, Co, Ni, Pd, Cu) Chromium (Cr, r Cr = 0.12491 nm) substitution in TiFe 0.90 Cr 0.10 and TiFe 0.95 Cr 0.05 forms TiCr 2 as a secondary phase, which helps in accelerating activation process of the alloys. 122,131 The Cr substitution stabilized as well the first plateau, while reducing the length of the second one. Cr-Substituted TiFe alloys have higher hardness, are more brittle and easier to pulverise with respect to the non-substituted compound. This can be the reason for improved kinetics and reduced hysteresis due to Cr-substitutions. 132 On the other hand, this conclusion is in contrast with the higher strain claimed due to Cr substitution. As a matter of fact, usually hysteresis is generated either by elastic strain or by plastic deformation (dislocations, slip bands), and it increases with hardening. 133 By mechanochemistry, up to 6 at% of Cr can be included into TiFe, enlarging the cell parameter with a small expansion of the cell volume, lowering crystallite size, and simplifying the activation process. 134 Differently to what is expected from geometric considerations, both plateau pressures are shifted to higher value compared to TiFe, and the gamma phase is also destabilised. 134 The combined substitution of chromium and yttrium in TiFe evidenced an enlargement of the cell constant, the formation of secondary phases (Ti, Cr-Fe solid solution, a-Y), improved kinetic and sloped PCI curves, with a lowering of the plateau pressures and hysteresis. 132 On the other hand, the combined substitution of Cr and Zr in TiFe evidenced the formation of TiFe 2 as secondary phase, which acts as gateway for hydrogen, easing the activation process of the material. 135 The material was activated at 28 1C under 31 bar, and it did not lose any capacity after 50 cycles. 135 Molybdenum (Mo, r Mo = 0.13626 nm) substitution was reported to lower plateau pressures and to introduce sloppy plateaus. 130,136 The substitution of Fe with cobalt (Co, r Co = 0.1251 nm) linearly decreases the first plateau pressure and also reduces the capacity of the material, since only the monohydride is formed. [137][138][139] Recently, improved resistance to poisoning and the suppression of the g phase was also observed for Co-substituted materials by mechanical alloying, while, in the as-cast conditions, the second plateau was observed to increase the equilibrium pressure. 129 Nickel (Ni, r Ni = 0.12459 nm) substitutes Fe with no significant changes in the microstructure, 122 improves activation and lowers hysteresis between absorption and desorption curves. 140 However, it increases the pressure gap between the first and second plateau, reducing the reversible capacity of the material in a narrow pressure range. 141 Owing to Ni substitution, improved kinetics is observed because of promoted surface sorption. In fact, the rate determining step in hydrogen sorption is the bulk reaction. 142 Furthermore, the use of catalysts like Ni nanoparticles at TiFe surface has been reported to considerably enhance the rate of hydrogenation process, even if it cannot be consider as a substituent. 138,143 Additionally, increasing the Ni content, the cell parameter of TiFe increases, decreasing plateaus pressures, decreasing capacity and increasing the decomposition temperature and the cohesive energy of the hydride. 144,145 Modified thermodynamics have been reported as well, with lower value of enthalpy and entropy for Ni-substituted TiFe. 146,147 Distorted g region has been observed. 138 Addition of Ni stabilized the monohydride as observed in mono-substituted TiFe 1Àx Ni x compounds. 138,145 It improves cyclability of the material up to 65 000 cycles and the reduced loss in capacity was related to possible hydrogen trapped or deactivated reaction site in the material (TiFe 0.80 Ni 0.20 ). 148 Nevertheless, Jain et al. reported a general negative impact on hydrogen storage properties of Ni substitution for Fe. 119 In the literature, few examples of multi-substituted TiFe-Ni alloys are reported. In the same paper cited before, Jain et al. reported a beneficial improvement of activation and kinetics by introducing 4 wt% of Zr 7 Ni 10 . It reduces the plateaus pressure but decreases as well the capacity, down to 1.34 wt% at 40 1C and 20 bar, thus with negative effect on hydrogenation properties. 119,149© This mixture results in the formation of secondary phases that improve the activation process (making the material more brittle).

        <p>The simultaneous addition of Ni and V, or Ni and Nb, to TiFe was beneficial for the activation process, possible at 28 1C and under 20 bar with a short incubation time (30-40 minutes), reducing hysteresis, lowering the plateau pressures, and granting good capacity and kinetics with no sensible variation of the thermodynamics. 150 In contrast, a significant variation of the thermodynamics has been evidenced in the case of combined Ni and Mg substitution. 146 Substitution in TiFe by alloying Palladium (Pd, r Pd = 0.13754 nm) mitigates the activation process, lowers the plateau pressure of the monohydride (enlarging the cell parameter of TiFe) but it has no effect on the stability of the g phase. 151 Beside, the addition of free Pd as nano-catalyst nanostructured with TiFe by milling has been reported in many studies to improve air resistance to poisoning and facile activation at room temperature. [152][153][154][155][156] Equally to Ni, the use of Pd nanoparticles as catalyst considerably enhances the rate of hydrogenation process. 138,143 Mechanochemical synthesis can introduce copper (Cu, r Cu = 0.1278 nm) into TiFe, enlarging the cell parameter, thus reducing the first plateau pressure of the binary compound. 117 The combination of Cu substitution for Fe in TiFe and the addition of Fe 2 O 3 has a positive impact on activation process, that is promoted thanks to a more brittle TiFe matrix, an enhanced formation of active surface by cracking, and the lowering of the plateau pressure. 127 Rare-earths (Y, La, Ce, Mm) Yttrium substitution (Y, r Y = 0.18015 nm) for Ti into TiFe modifies the properties of the material. The increase in Y content linearly increases the cell parameter of TiFe and reduces the crystallite size, without changing significantly the microstructure. 157 A fast kinetics and an easy activation process are observed, with no incubation time at room temperature and 25 bar. 157 However, on increasing Y content, the capacity of the material decreases, due to the formation of secondary phases (TiFe 2 , Y and Ti precipitates). 157 The addition of 5 wt% of Lanthanum (La, r La = 0.1879 nm) to TiFe faces the issue of La immiscibility in the intermetallic compound, but still improves the activation process, thanks to crack formation. Indeed, the incubation time is reduced increasing La content. 158 The capacity is claimed to be improved and small hysteresis is observed. 158 Cerium (Ce, r Ce = 0.18247 nm) substitution for Fe improves activation process and kinetics, because of the formation of small crystallite sizes, that induce high surface reactivity, while increasing the cell parameter of TiFe. 159 The addition of mischmetal (Mm, containing La, Ce, Pr, Nd) to TiFe allows easy activation at room temperature after a short incubation time, owing to the cracking of the material caused by Mm inclusions. No evidence of Mm substitution in TiFe were clearly reported. 160,161 In these materials, TEM analysis evidenced the formation of channels that could be depicted by electron micrograph in the hydrogenated sample, and that improves absorption kinetic. 162 Xin-Nan et al. demonstrated that the addition of Mischmetal to TiFe enhances the resistance towards impurities (mainly O 2 and CO 2 ). 163 In their work, TiFe with 3 wt% Mm was cycled under hydrogen with a purity below 99%. Moreover, they claimed that the material exhibits a lower decrease in capacity during cycling compared to pure TiFe. When exposed to pure H 2 , it recovers its capacity within a few cycles without any annealing treatment.The simultaneous addition of Ni and V, or Ni and Nb, to TiFe was beneficial for the activation process, possible at 28 1C and under 20 bar with a short incubation time (30-40 minutes), reducing hysteresis, lowering the plateau pressures, and granting good capacity and kinetics with no sensible variation of the thermodynamics. 150 In contrast, a significant variation of the thermodynamics has been evidenced in the case of combined Ni and Mg substitution. 146 Substitution in TiFe by alloying Palladium (Pd, r Pd = 0.13754 nm) mitigates the activation process, lowers the plateau pressure of the monohydride (enlarging the cell parameter of TiFe) but it has no effect on the stability of the g phase. 151 Beside, the addition of free Pd as nano-catalyst nanostructured with TiFe by milling has been reported in many studies to improve air resistance to poisoning and facile activation at room temperature.

        <p>The effect of aluminium (Al, r Al = 0.14317 nm) substitution in TiFe has been extensively studied, evidencing an improvement of the kinetics, but the generation of sloped PCI curves. 164 Aluminium substitutes Fe increasing TiFe cell parameter. 122 It causes negative impact on hydrogenation properties. An increase of the Al content increases the slope of the PCIs, which, compared to TiFe, are shifted to higher pressure values, even if larger cell parameters are observed. 138 The second plateau either disappears or moves to high pressures, inhibiting the formation of the g hydride, with a consequent drastic fall of the hydrogen capacity of the material. 110,164 The generation of a sloped plateau has been related compositional inhomogeneity in as cast samples and the formation of octahedral interstice's size gradient. 138 Increasing Al substitution for Fe also modifies the thermodynamics and reduces hysteresis, due to the difference in valence electrons between Al and Fe. 164 In the same study of Zadorozhnyy et al. cited before, up to 20 at% of Al were substituted to Fe in TiFe by mechanochemistry, with results similar to those observed for Cr substitution. 134 Silicon (Si, r Si = 0.1153 nm) can substitute Fe, causing the formation of secondary phases such as TiFe 2 and Ti, depending on the stoichiometry, and diminishing the hydrogen storage capacity. 122 Si has deleterious influence on the capacity because the second plateau is shifted to high pressures, while the first plateau becomes very sloppy and shifted to lower pressure as compared to TiFe, as it occurs for Cu and Ni substitutions. 122 Kulshreshtha et al. studied Tin (Sn, r Sn = 0.162 nm) that substitutes both Ti and Fe in TiFe. Activation and kinetics are improved, while capacity is decreased. 165 The improvement of activation has been related to the formation of TiFe 2 as secondary precipitates (in a critical minimum size), which causes strain induced micro cracks owing to different thermal expansion. Surprisingly, the Sn substitution causes a shrink in cell volume of TiFe, leading to an increase of pressure for both plateaus, together with an increase of corresponding DH and DS values. 165The effect of aluminium (Al, r Al = 0.14317 nm) substitution in TiFe has been extensively studied, evidencing an improvement of the kinetics, but the generation of sloped PCI curves. 164 Aluminium substitutes Fe increasing TiFe cell parameter. 122 It causes negative impact on hydrogenation properties.

        <p>The ternary Ti-Fe-Mn phase diagram presents many phases at 1000 1C, as reported in Fig. 6. The b-Ti solid solution region, as well as the Ti(Fe,Mn) 2 C14 laves phases, have large homogeneity domains. At 1000 1C, the intermetallic compound TiFe exists in the range of 49.7 to 52.5 at% Ti. Mn can substitute Fe in this compound up to 27 atomic percent in a narrow region of Ti composition, as reported by Dew-Hughes et al. 177 . For this reasons, the authors recently investigated Mn-substituted alloys in a wide range of composition, variating both Mn and Ti content. 178 Manganese substitution for Fe enables the hydrogen sorption at lower pressure by enlarging the cell volume of TiFe. 70 The higher the Mn content, the lower is the hydrogen sorption pressure for both plateaus. 179 Furthermore, easy activation of Mn-substituted TiFe has been related to highly reactive grain boundaries induced by segregation of metal atoms or cluster-like precipitates formation, that can deviate the concentration ratio of components especially at the surface. 70,84,180,181 Reilly et al. were the first group in the 70's studying TiFe for hydrogen storage. They have published several reports on Mn substitution either in equiatomic or Ti-rich TiFe alloys. 79,88,105,136,182,183 They evidenced many positive improvements compared to pure TiFe. Mn modifies the microstructure, reduces the hysteresis, 140,184 improves the activation. 122 In addition, Mn substitutions promote the presence of secondary phases, such as b-Ti solid solution or Ti(Fe,Mn) 2 , that facilitate the alloy cracking and the creation of fresh clean surfaces during the first hydrogen absorption. Furthermore, good long-term cycling performances (without disproportionation or phase separation) and improved hydrogen capacity are reported. 105,136,182 The latter probably relates to the thermodynamic stabilisation (i.e. decreased plateau pressure) of the dihydride, so that hydrogen saturation in the g-phase can be easily reached at low applied pressures. 105,136,182 It was also evidenced that a high amount of Mn (e.g. TiFe 0.70 Mn 0.30 ) actually decreases the total capacity of the material, due to the significant formation of secondary phases, i.e. Ti(Fe,Mn) 2 , which are not reactive to hydrogen in mild condition of temperature and pressure. 136 Lee et al. reported better kinetics and activation when Mn is introduced into TiFe, thanks to the presence of secondary phases, improving capacity as well. 131 In their study, the PCI of TiFe 0.90 Mn 0.10 and TiFe 0.80 Mn 0.20 reported at 50 1C showed lower plateau pressures and reduced dihydride region due to the substitution, compared to TiFe. 131 Since, by increasing the Mn content, an improvement of kinetics is observed, activation is realized in short incubation time under moderate conditions (room temperature and low pressure). Furthermore the hysteresis between absorption and desorption is reduced. 52 The good kinetics seems not to be related to hydride stability nor to particle size, but to the formation of Mn clusters that enhances a faster hydrogenation compared to TiFe. 185 Sandrock et al. reported the thermodynamics of TiFe 0.85 Mn 0.15 , where the incorporation of Mn in the compound generates higher enthalpy and entropy of reaction, but also higher capacity, compared to TiFe. 186 TiFe 0.85 Mn 0.15 was also recently investigated, evidencing an easy single-step reactivation at 300 1C after oxidation in air. 187 Milling effect in Ti(Fe,Mn) alloys evidenced that a reduction of size and microstructure promotes an easy activation and an enhanced kinetics, slightly modifying hydrogenation properties and generating a sloping plateau, which is stabilized at lower pressure compared to the pristine alloy. 117,188 Severe plastic deformation, such as high pressure torsion, has been used to improve activation and air resistivity on Mn-substituted TiFe alloys, owing to the formation of lattice defects at the grain boundaries and amorphous regions, that are claimed to act as channels for fast hydrogen diffusion facilitating activation. 48 Lee et al. stated that the addition of manganese to TiFe increases the hydriding rate. 189 In TiFe 0.80 Mn 0.20 , at low reacted fraction, the rate-determining step is chemisorption, while, towards the end of sorption, it is the chemical reaction at the metal-hydride interface. 189 The hydriding reaction rate increases with increasing pressure at constant temperature and with decreasing temperature at constant pressure. In fact, if the temperature increases at constant pressure, the exponential term of the rate equation, which includes the activation energy term, increases, but the equilibrium pressure or the driving force term decreases. Thus, since a relatively small activation energy is compared to a rather drastic pressure change with temperature,The ternary Ti-Fe-Mn phase diagram presents many phases at 1000 1C, as reported in Fig. 6.

        <p>Review it results in a decrease in the reaction rate with temperature. 189 Lee et al. calculated the rate constant for TiFe and TiFe 0.80 Mn 0.20 and the obtained values suggest chemisorption as main ratedetermining step.

        <p>However, even if activation is improved and is reproducible in Mn-substituted TiFe compounds, they still suffer from sensitivity to contaminants such as O 2 , CO, CO 2 , H 2 S, H 2 O 136,168 and Cl 2 . 184 Shwartz et al. reported that Ti is oxidised by O 2 to form TiO 2 in two steps.

        <p>Ball milling has been used to incorporate both Zr and Mn into TiFe intermetallic compound, enhancing the activation of the material, and making it possible at room temperature and 40 bar. 192 By increasing the content of Mn and Zr, the equilibrium pressure is lowered, while activation, kinetics and resistance to air are improved. 193,194 In contrast, capacity is reduced, because only the monohydride can be formed by Zr substitution. 195 The introduction of both V and Mn results in lower plateaus pressures, decreased hysteresis, flatter plateaus, good activation and capacity, showing a synergic effect of both Mn and V. 123 The effect of the double substitution in Fe-rich alloys (detailed composition reported in Table 4) was explored by Mitrokhin et al. evidencing the formation of a secondary C14 Laves phase. 196,197 Combined Mn and V substitution reduces the pressure gap (V effect) between the two plateaus, that merge into one at lower pressure compared to pure TiFe, while enthalpy of reaction increases (Mn effect). 196 Even if resistance to contaminants was not improved, easy activation was observed but with very slow kinetics. 196,197 TiFe 0.80 Mn 0.20 with the addition of V was scaled up to 55 kg by Japan Metals &amp; Chemicals Co.

As a drawback, PCI curves are sloped and the second plateau is observed at an increased equilibrium pressure. 199 Another example of bi-substituted compounds is the Ni addition to pseudobinary Ti(Fe,Mn) compounds. Ni for Mn substitution has been evaluated, evidencing no significant variation of the cell parameter. Challet et al. 141 introduced both Mn and Ni into Ti-rich TiFe 0.90 observing that Ni addition improved activation process but strongly affects the hydrogenation properties as well. A decrease of the first plateau pressure and an increase of the second one was observed, stabilising the monohydride and destabilising the dihydride. As a consequence, the adjustment of both plateau pressures in a narrow pressure range is much more difficult to achieve when substituting Mn by Ni.

        <p>Furthermore, the process history of the sample influences the shape of the PCI curves. For example, milling under argon with small amount of Ni, dispersed as a catalyst, allows to synthetize a material that does not need activation and has a longer cycle lifetime compared to pure TiFe. 200 The combined substitution of Cu and Mn for Fe in TiFe 0.90 was recently evaluated by Dematteis et al. 201 . Easy activation and fast kinetics were granted thanks to the Mn substitution and the formation of small amount of secondary phases (b-Ti and Ti 4 Fe 2 O-type as precipitates). Cu augments the secondary phase amounts while increasing the TiFe cell parameter and decreasing the first plateau pressure. Similarly to Ni, a negative effect of Cu substitution is that it rises the second plateau pressure, revealing the predominance of electronic effects associated with this substitution that should be verified and deepen by ab initio calculations of their electronic structure (i.e. analysis of density of states).Furthermore, the process history of the sample influences the shape of the PCI curves.

        <p>The combined substitution of Mn and Y causes an enlargement of the cell constant, thus lowering the plateau pressure in PCI curves, which are still flat and shows double plateaus only in desorption. 132 Y is generally not highly soluble into TiFe, so a-Y precipitates are formed. 132 Addition of Ce to TiFe 0.90 Mn 0.10 evidenced no effect on the thermodynamics and cycling properties of the material, while, increasing Ce content improves kinetics but slightly lower the hydrogen capacity. 202 The activation process is remarkably improved as well, requiring no annealing at high temperature and no incubation time at 80 1C and 40 bar. 202 The study of Ti l+x Fe 1Ày Mn y Mm z (x = 0.0-0.9, y = 0.04-0.2, z = 0.002-0.028) system evidenced that 0.5-1.0 wt% of mischmetal is the optimum amount for improving activation at room temperature in this system, preventing oxidation during processing, and slightly affecting the hydrogenation properties.

        <p>As a matter of fact, alkaline earths (Mg, Be) are expected to substitute Ti in the case of Mg (not verified experimentally), and Fe in the case of Be. Early transition metals possibly substitute Ti as they are A-type elements. However, hafnium and tantalum substitutions were not clearly investigated. Late transition metals substitute Fe as they are B-type elements. This behaviour has been verified for all elements except for Pd, which either has been added as a catalyst or substituted without further details on atomic site location. Rare earths possibly substitute Ti as they are A-type compounds. Though this is the case for yttrium, lanthanum and mischmetal are reported to have no solubility in TiFe, and Cerium probably substitutes Fe. p-block elements are expected to substitute Fe, as they are B-type elements.

        <p>Addition of elements in the formulation of TiFe can lead either to a substitution (i.e. entering into the TiFe structure at Ti or Fe sites) or to an addition (i.e. forming precipitates like second intermetallic phases or oxides). An element can present both behaviours, depending on its limit of solubility in the TiFe phase. For the first case (substitution), the lattice parameter of TiFe phase is modified according to the change in its composition. It leads to modifications of the thermodynamic properties, such as enthalpy, entropy, PCI shape and number of plateaus. For the second one (addition), secondary phases are formed, often accompanied by microstructural changes and increased brittleness. It leads to modification on dynamic and ageing properties like activation, kinetics, poisoning, and cycling.Addition of elements in the formulation of TiFe can lead either to a substitution (i.e. entering into the TiFe structure at Ti or Fe sites) or to an addition (i.e. forming precipitates like second intermetallic phases or oxides).

        <p>and kinetics. It is reported that the TiFe activation is facilitated by adding Al, Si, Mn and Mg, which prevent oxidation, hence allowing the hydrogen absorption process. Cu and Ni substitution seems to be less effective compared to the previous cited elements. 169 The prevented TiFe oxidation by Al, Si, Mn and Mg may be related to the fact that these elements form more stable oxides than Cu and Ni, getting preferentially oxidized compared to TiFe, and behaving as oxygen getters. Improved activation can be related to a catalytic behaviour of the additive or the formation of secondary phases at the grain boundaries, with enough size and abundance. Surface solid-gas interactions are enhanced by the presence of secondary phases or elemental clusters, which are highly reactive towards hydrogen, thus promoting hydrogen chemisorption and causing cracks by expansion during hydriding reaction. This process creates preferential channels for hydrogen towards the TiFephase or fresh oxide-free surfaces accessible for hydrogenation. Even if secondary phases have different mechanical behaviours, the activation process can be improved owing to the cracking process caused by different thermal expansion compared to TiFe. Alternatively, activation can also be facilitated by the creation of lattice defects (such as vacancies, stacking faults) or amorphous regions, generated by severe plastic deformation processes. Mechanical properties of the material are thus important to facilitate activation properties. For instance, brittle materials can be easily pulverized and activated because they expose fresh surfaces. The effect of substitution on modifying microstructure is thus important to be characterized and understood.and kinetics.

        <p>TiFe has poor absorption and desorption kinetic properties, however the partial substitution of Fe (e.g. with Ni, Mn, Cu) can improve the rate of the processes. This effect can be explained by the highly catalytic effect of Ni towards hydrogen chemisorption or, in the case of Mn, by the lowering of plateaus pressure, which increases the driven force for a given applied pressure.

        <p>General correlations have been evidenced regarding geometric models stating that a linear relationship exists between the logarithm of the plateau pressure and the volume of the unitcell or interstitial sites of the alloy. The larger the volume, the more stable the hydride is. 105,136,210,211 Shinar et al. collected different PCI curves at different temperatures and the related thermodynamics of TiFe 0.80 M 0.20 alloys substituted by M = Mn, Cr, V, Co, Ni and Cu, evidencing that only the Mn-substituted hydrides showed clearly two flat plateaus, while, Cr-and V-substituted ones present two sloped plateaus and the formation of secondary phases. 212 For Co, Ni and Cu, only one plateau was observed. 212 Slopped plateaus can be caused by chemical inhomogeneity in substituted TiFe-alloys. Furthermore, size distribution of interstices caused by inhomogeneous distribution of substituents is claimed to cause sloping plateaus. 138,213 Another reason related to sloped plateaus is derived from continuous re-distribution of metallic elements during hydrogenation to form the fully hydrogenated compound, if fast diffusion and full local equilibrium (i.e. orthoequilibrium) occur, instead of equilibrium limited to hydrogen as fast diffuser (i.e. para-equilibrium). 214 The addition of a ternary substituent can reduce as well the hysteresis effect. 215 Many different parameters should be considered and can be correlated to the substitution effects of different elements to hydrogenation properties of the TiFe intermetallic compound. As cited before, the logarithm of the first plateau pressure can be inversely correlated with the unit cell volume of the TiFe phase. During the structural transition from the intermetallic compound to the hydride, the lattice expansion/distortion is related to the thermodynamic stability of the hydrides and to the dimension of the octahedral interstices where hydrogen is hosted. Geometrical features can also explain why, in some cases, the formation of the g phase is hindered, together with electronic effects associated to the difference in valence electrons between the substituted element and Ti or Fe. Substitution does not only modify the volume of the interstices, but also the bond strength between hydrogen and metal atoms. The strength of M-H bonds determines the hydrogenation properties too. Yukawa et al. demonstrated that molecular orbital method and the study of electronic structure can clarify the relationship between bond order and strength, and their relation to hydrogen storage properties in substituted TiFe materials. 216 They reported that the hydrogen atoms interact stronger with Fe rather than with Ti, thus the chemical bond energy or the type of interaction with this atom or any substitutional elements modify the stability of the hydride phase. 216 Different substitutional elements' properties (e.g. electronegativity and hydrogen affinity) can also influence hydrogenation properties, leading to different stabilities or binding energies (i.e. electronic structure) of hydrogen in the interstitial site. The role and influence of these properties on hydrogenation should be further studied and understood, possibly combining DFT calculations to determine electronic properties, density of states and to further understand their role and relation to hydrogenation properties.General correlations have been evidenced regarding geometric models stating that a linear relationship exists between the logarithm of the plateau pressure and the volume of the unitcell or interstitial sites of the alloy.

        <p>Moreover, substitution influences the hydrogenation properties of the material, modifying its Gibbs free energy. Thus, hydrogenation properties can be related to the entropy of mixing of hydrogen to enter the interstitial voids or the affinity of hydrogen with the substitutional elements. 217,218 This can explain the correlation between different elements and the variation of enthalpy or entropy of hydrides formation. 217,218 In 1981, Mintz et al. already discussed the influence of substitution in ternary TiFe alloys, reporting a sequence of hydride stability (from more to less stable Cr 4 Mn 4 Ni 4 Co 4 Fe). 138,215 The authors showed that a linear correlation of hydrogenation enthalpy as a function of substituent content is experimentally verified. 215 In Fig. 7, enthalpy and entropy values (a and b, respectively) for the first and second plateau in TiFe-type alloy collected in this review are reported as a function of values of the TiFe cell volume. Dashed lines for DH (39 kJ mol À1 ) required at 25 1C to obtain 0.1 MPa plateau pressure with an expected entropy for gas-solid transition (130 J mol À1 K À1 ) are reported as reference values.Moreover, substitution influences the hydrogenation properties of the material, modifying its Gibbs free energy.

        <p>A recent review from Lototskyy et al. 220 reports some examples of MH-tank and FC system developed at the lab-scale using metal hydrides. Most of systems are based on AB 2 ((TiZr) (Mn,Fe,V) 2 -type) and AB 5 (LaNi 5 -type) intermetallic compounds, which are usually preferred thanks to their low pressure and temperature working conditions, despite their moderate gravimetric capacity. In the following applications of TiFe-based alloys will be reported and reviewed. Back in the 70s, the Brookhaven National Laboratory studied and developed bulk storage techniques for hydrogen using TiFe. The program consisted of a variety of activities which include engineering analysis and design of a large bulk hydrogen storage facility, engineering-scale tests, work on the selection and development of suitable iron-titanium alloys, and the construction of a large prototype energy storage system. 221 Strickland et al. implemented a small test bed of 38 kg of iron titanium hydride as storage media. The maximum hydrogen storage capacity, under the studied operating conditions, was 1.19 wt% for the FeTi alloy and a uniform hydrogen flow rate of 9 normal litre per min was sustained for a 10 hour transfer period. 222 Vessels of different dimensions were considered and tested for volumetric expansion with different alloy loading. 223 In the study, TiFe 0.70 Mn 0.18 alloy was also considered. 223 Finally, the reservoir has been scaled up to store 6 kg hydrogen using 405 kg of TiFe. 224 This latter prototype system was built for the Public Service Electric and Gas Company of New Jersey to study the feasibility of storing off-peak electrical energy through the use of a water electrolyser, a hydride reservoir and a fuel cell stack. 224 The use of TiFe in hydride beds has been developed for storing and supplying hydrogen fuel in power plant and automotive applications. 225 An hydride bed was built at Brookhaven National Laboratory for the Public Service Electric and Gas Co., with a release rate roughly constant of approximately 0.036 Ib ft À1 h (0.000015 Pa s). 224 Finally, a techno-economic assessment was performed for a hydrogen-chlorine energy storage system for electric utility load levelling and peak shaving applications that involved hydrogen storage in TiFe-alloy. 226 Recently, a conventional bench-scale tank based on TiFe carriers have been developed in Japan. 198 Endo et al. developed a TiFe-based material to be used in an integrated system with an electrolyser and a fuel cell. The material is a modified TiFe 0.80 Mn 0.20 alloy, with the introduction of some V and annealed at 1100 1C for 24 h. 198 The activation of the material was performed at modest temperature and low pressure, according to Japanese safety regulations (i.e. approx. 80 1C and 2 bar).

        <p>As a conclusion, TiFe remains an attractive alloy for hydrogen storage regarding its low cost and significant capacity. However, it is worth noting that the binary compound has some drawbacks to be overcome by suitable substitutions, strongly improving activation and kinetics. However, thermodynamics and hydrogenation properties are also influenced, and often a drop in capacity can be observed. This review evidences that Mn is a key element as substituent in TiFe system. In addition, V, and the synergic effect of Mn and V can be exploited. However, it should be kept in mind that V is a CRMs for Europe. On the other hand, many other elements such as Mg, Ta, Zr, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu and S are not suitable for industrial upscaled materials. Zr, Cr and S lead to sensible reduction of storage capacity. Mg, Ta, Co, Ni are CRMs. Cu increases sensibly the pressure gap between the first and second plateau. Effect of contaminants during synthesis (such as B, C, N, O) should be studied and understood with care because they can negatively influence hydrogenation properties of the material. As a general assertion, bi-and multi-substituted alloys can combine some synergic and beneficial effects, which however are not drastically better than for mono-substituted cases.As a conclusion, TiFe remains an attractive alloy for hydrogen storage regarding its low cost and significant capacity.

On the other hand, many other elements such as Mg, Ta, Zr, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu and S are not suitable for industrial upscaled materials. Zr, Cr and S lead to sensible reduction of storage capacity. Mg, Ta, Co, Ni are CRMs. Cu increases sensibly the pressure gap between the first and second plateau. Effect of contaminants during synthesis (such as B, C, N, O) should be studied and understood with care because they can negatively influence hydrogenation properties of the material. As a general assertion, bi-and multi-substituted alloys can combine some synergic and beneficial effects, which however are not drastically better than for mono-substituted cases.</p>
        <p>The study performed in this work evidenced that systematic studies on TiFe-substituted alloys are scarce in the literature. In the last years, a high number of reports have been published with only partial characterisation of the studied alloys, making hard the understanding of the full picture concerning activation, thermodynamics, kinetics and chemistry of the studied systems. To further understand the role of elemental substitution in TiFe on the modification of hydride stability and hydrogenation properties, there is a strong need of complete studies including compositional, structural, microstructural, activation, kinetic, and thermodynamic data. More attention should be focused on the determination of elemental substitution in TiFe, perhaps by electron microprobe analysis (EMPA) or by coupling scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping to analytically determine the alloy (TiFe-phase) exact composition. Structural studies should also include experimental or computational evidences of possible elemental substitution in Ti or Fe position. The determination of cell parameter of TiFe, and relative abundances of secondary phases determined by microscopy and X-ray diffraction (coupled to Rietveld analysis) methods are useful information to understand the geometrical implication of substitution. Neutron studies are complementary for the full solution of crystal structure of substituted systems. The review was not focused on neutron studies on TiFe systems, but there is a big lack of these determinations. Some studies can be found in the following ref. 61-63, 66, 67, 69, 70, 74 and 230-233. The study and assessment of ternary and higher phase diagrams can also help in the definition of phase boundaries, thus elucidating the formation of secondary phases and their possible role in enhancing activation properties. Mechanical properties and microstructural studies of these materials are also of great interest because they can be related to enhanced activation process and easy handling during industrial processing such as crushing process or pellet preparation.The study performed in this work evidenced that systematic studies on TiFe-substituted alloys are scarce in the literature.

        <p>In conclusion, the determination of thermodynamics in these systems must be conducted with care. Annealed samples can be representative of equilibrium phases, and the study of PCI curves with sufficient waiting time for the determination of equilibrium pressure points both in absorption and desorption is essential. PCI curves should also be determined in an appropriately large temperature range to guarantee a correct determination of enthalpy and entropy by the Van't Hoff plot. Coupling calorimetric determinations can confirm and complete the thermodynamic study. Cycling properties and resistance to poisoning are not frequent in literature studies, but they are of great interest for real applications of these materials. More efforts should focus on these studies and the definition of the mechanisms involved, in order to solve dropping capacity problems in case of not pure hydrogen produced by commercial electrolysers. Few other properties, which were not included in this review, are also of great interest for real applications. They include thermal properties (thermal conductivity, heat capacity), density and porosity determination. The definition of these parameters will help the upscale and development of prototype tanks for solid-state hydrogen storage based on TiFe systems, which nowadays are limited to few example that exploit Mn and V substitution for stationary hydrogen storage in mild condition of temperature and pressure.In conclusion, the determination of thermodynamics in these systems must be conducted with care.
