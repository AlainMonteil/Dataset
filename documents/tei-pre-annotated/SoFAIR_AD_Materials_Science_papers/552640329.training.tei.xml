        <p>Dielectric materials, such as glass, mica, wood, rubber, ebonite, paper, air, and vacuum are electrically insulating or non-conducting materials; typically, the energy gap is greater than 3 eV. Nevertheless, dielectric materials become polarized when subjected to an external electric field. [1][2][3] The electric polarization occurs when the positive and negative charges in the material are displaced towards and opposite directions of an external electric field. In general, dielectric materials are classified into two main categories, namely linear and non-linear dielectrics. The primary applications of non-linear dielectric materials are capacitors, transformers, resonators, transducers, semiconductor devices, noise filters, radio-frequency transmitters, power cables, gate dielectrics, and liquid crystal displays. [4][5][6][7] Piezoelectricity is the ability of a dielectric material to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy and vice versa. Interestingly, the piezoelectric properties of the material are highly diverse, and the electromechanical interaction characteristics are characterised by the direct and converse piezoelectric effect. The piezoelectric coefficient or charge constant (dij) is a measure of the generation of internal electric field per unit of applied mechanical stress (direct piezoelectric effect), or the mechanical strain per unit electric field (converse piezoelectric effect). 1,3 Manifestations of piezoelectric materials can be characterized by key piezoelectric (longitudinal and transverse), where magnitude of the induced piezoelectric coefficients are represented by the units pC N -1 (direct piezoelectric effect) and pm N -1 (converse piezoelectric effect), respectively. The direct piezoelectric effect was discovered in 1880 by Pierre and Jacques on a single crystal of Rochelle salt. 8,9 Moreover, a lack of mirror-plane or inversion symmetry is required to exhibit piezoelectric properties in crystalline materials. Among the 32 crystallographic classes, which include 230 space groups, 21 of them are non-centrosymmetric or piezoelectric (except 432), the remaining 11 belong to centrosymmetric or non-piezoelectric (inversion center) classes. 10 The 10 polar point groups [1 (C1), 2 (C2), m (C1h), mm2 (C2v), 4 (C4), 4mm (C4v), 3 (C3), 3m (C3v), 6 (C6), and 6mm (C6v), with a unique polarization axis, whose spontaneous polarization varies with temperature, is exhibit pyroelectricity and generate charge in response to a temperature change. [11][12][13] If the intrinsic spontaneous polarization can be reversed or reoriented by an external electric field and produces a polarization reversal or hysteresis loop, the material exhibits ferroelectricity. Ferroelectric materials are a special type of dielectric material and a subgroup of both piezo-and pyro-electric materials. All ferroelectric materials display piezoand pyro-electric behavior, but the converse is not ideally true; as outlined in Figure 1. The macroscopic polar arrangement of a ferroelectric material can be disturbed with a temperature increase due to a phase transition. For example, in the vicinity, and below, the structural phase transition temperature (the Curie temperature, TC), the non-linear dielectric material turns from a high symmetry disordered state (paraelectric) to a low symmetry order state (ferroelectric).Dielectric materials, such as glass, mica, wood, rubber, ebonite, paper, air, and vacuum are electrically insulating or non-conducting materials; typically, the energy gap is greater than 3 eV.

        <p>The need for energy harvesting technologies is increasing with the worldwide growth in population density, rapid technological progression, expanding automation and spreading All crystal classes (32) Piezoelectrics (20) Pyroelectrics (10) Ferroelectrics electronic networks. Currently, most of these demands are met by consuming non-renewable resources such as fossil fuels (coal, oil, petroleum, and natural gas), metal ores, and earth minerals. [16][17][18] In this regard, alternative sustainable and highly abundant energy sources such as solar, heat, wind, biomass, biofuel, tidal and mechanical energy have been explored to some extent. [19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27] For example, a number of diverse approaches that have been established to harvest simple and eco-friendly waste energy into usable electrical energy for optoelectronic applications. [28][29][30][31][32] The conversion of mechanical energy into electrical energy is of significant interest due to the simplicity of its generation from a variety of external sources such as pressure fluctuations, bending, folding, and stretching movements. This form of harvesting is generally utilized to drive low-power electronics, often in the W to mW range, and serves as an autonomous power source for applications in wireless sensor networks. 22,[33][34][35] In this regard, supramolecular organic and organic-inorganic hybrid piezo-and ferro-electric materials characterized by asymmetric crystallographic arrangement and intrinsic polarization have attracted significant attention. 36 These materials have also found significant commercial application in modern electronic sensors, capacitors, actuators, sonar, buzzers, transducers, thermoelectrics, photovoltaics, and piezoelectric energy harvesters. [37][38][39][40] The first examples of piezo-and ferro-electric materials were organic hydrogen-bonded molecules such as Rochelle salt (NaKC4H4O6•4H2O) and potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4). 41,42 Subsequently, new families of non-hydrogen bonded perovskites have been discovered, based on inorganic ceramic oxides (PbZrTiO3, BaTiO3, PbTiO3, LiNbO3, NaNbO3 and KNbO3). Such inorganic ferroelectric materials have been investigated in detail due to their excellent piezo-and ferro-electric properties. [43][44][45][46][47] However, a number of inorganic ceramic oxide materials are derived from toxic lead-based systems, rare-earth or heavy metals. They are also brittle (low fracture toughness), possess high stiffness, high density, and require high processing temperatures for the solid-state sintering process. Therefore, the use of these materials in flexible energy harvesting and wearable electronic applications is restricted. 48,49 As a result, it is desirable to formulate new materials that are lead and heavy metal-free, ecofriendly and can be formed at low processing temperatures to generate energy harvesters for low-power electronic applications. Among the range of commercially available polymers, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and its copolymers have attracted attention because of their high piezoelectric polarization. 50,51 However, the synthesis of the electroactive ferroelectric βphase of PVDF remains a challenging task. For example, there is a need for external binders or a mechanical stretching process to produce the β-phase of PVDF, which increases processing complexity. 52,53 As an alternative approach, composites based on small-molecule-based organic and organic-inorganic hybrid compounds are suitable for such applications. These newly emerging ferroelectric materials are advantageous for piezoelectric sensing and energy harvesting due to their facile synthesis, low processing temperatures, high thermal stability, light-weight nature, mechanical flexibility, high piezoelectric coefficient (a measure of the charge produced per unit force), and high Curie temperature, as outlined in Figures. 2 and 3. 54,55 However, to date, only a limited number of organic and organic-inorganic hybrid piezo-and ferro-electric materials have been explored for energy harvesting applications. 40,[56][57][58][59][60] In this review, we first provide a comprehensive overview highlighting traditional piezoelectric materials, such as zinc oxide nanowires, inorganic ferroelectric ceramic oxides and PVDF. We outline their current limitations and explain why new materials are needed. Subsequently, emphasis is given to recent developments in harvesters based on organic and organic-inorganic hybrids materials and composite structures for piezoelectric energy harvesting applications, describing recent advancements and key examples. In particular, we focus on organic and organic-inorganic hybrid energy harvesters along with their polymer matrix composites that showcase their ease of processing, an eco-friendly nature, highly stable properties and low production and energy cost for piezoelectric energy harvesting applications. While excellent review papers on piezoelectric energy harvesting and biomolecular and halide perovskites materials exist [56][57][58][59][60] , no comprehensive review to date has summarized recent advancements of organic and organic-inorganic hybrid energy harvester and their polymer matrix composites for piezoelectric energy harvesting applications. In this review, the key challenges associated with fabricating high-performance piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) based on organic and organic-inorganic hybrid materials and composites are described and discussed. Finally, the review concludes with an outlook into the challenges and the future directions of these intriguing new materials. This review opens with a brief overview of traditional PEHs (Section 2), before summarising the state of the art in modern PEHs, subdivided into purely organic systems (Sections 3 and 4), and hybrid systems (Sections 5 and 6).

        <p>Wang and coworkers in 2006 presented an exciting and pioneering development of a piezoelectric energy harvester by subjecting hexagonal zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires to external forces. 61 The electromechanical response of vertically grown ZnO nanowires was examined using a bending mode of operation. The observed output voltage of 8 mV and low power of 0.5 pW was a result of a low level of piezoelectric polarization. In addition to the use of ZnO nanowires, several semiconducting materials have been explored for mechanical energy harvesting, such as aluminum nitride (AlN, ultra-wide gap semiconductor, band gap of ~ 6 eV, typically in the form of thin-films, or nanowires), gallium nitride (GaN), indium nitride (InN), zinc sulfide (ZnS), and cadmium sulfide (CdS). 48,[62][63][64] Neglecting extrinsic contributions as a result of domain motion, the piezoelectric coefficient (dij) can be assumed to directly proportional to the remnant polarization of the material (e.g. d33 = 2Q33330Pr), where 33 is the dielectric constant, Q33 is electrostrictive coefficient, and Pr is the remnant polarization). 65,66 As a result, it is anticipated that the use of materials of similar Q33 with a high level of piezoand ferro-electric polarization can improve the performance of piezoelectric energy harvesting devices. Recently, the output performance of PEH devices based on inorganic ceramic oxides (PbZrTiO3, BaTiO3, PbTiO3, ZnSnO3, LiNbO3 and NaNbO3) has been significantly improved from nanowatts to milliwatts due to their improved piezoelectric polarization. While seveal of these ceramic materials show substantial energy harvesting abilities, they are brittle, high density and require a high processing temperature. Most importantly, the presence of hazardous bio-incompatible toxic metal ions limits their use in wearable electronics and medical applications. 57,67,68 As a result, research has been accelerated in the preparation of alternative low-density materials that are free of heavy metals for such portable applications. 69,70Wang and coworkers in 2006 presented an exciting and pioneering development of a piezoelectric energy harvester by subjecting hexagonal zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires to external forces. 61 The electromechanical response of vertically grown ZnO nanowires was examined using a bending mode of operation.

        <p>While many materials can be utilized for piezoelectric energy harvesting applications, a number lack biocompatibility that limits their utility in wearable electronics, including ZnO, AlN, InN, ZnS, CdS and ceramic metal oxides. As a result, bioinspired organic piezoelectric materials have emerged as promising mechanically responsive candidates for wearable electronic applications. Naturally occuring piezo-and ferro-electric materials exhibit a range of potential advantages such as biocompatibility, biosafety, biodegradability, functional molecular recognition and robust mechanical properties. A large number of environmentally friendly bioorganic materials have shown piezoelectric properties and can potentially be utilized for electromechanical energy harvesting applications; these include materials such as bone, wood, silk, cellulose, chitin, elastin, clamshell, amino acids, peptides, chitosan, alginate, fibrillar collagen, and viruses. 79,80 Among these materials, supramolecular self-assembled amino acids and peptides are of interest since they exhibit high piezoelectric polarization due to their permanent dipole moment. Interestingly, all amino acids, apart from glycine (specifically the α-form), exhibit polar crystal structures and have potential for use as a piezoelectric energy harvester. In general, glycine exhibits three different polymorphic phases (α, β, and γ) under ambient conditions. While the α-phase of glycine is centrosymmetric, its other two forms show non-centrosymmetric crystal structures. 81,82 Thompson and coworkers studied the piezoelectric behavior of the β-and γphases of glycine through both computational and experimental methods (Figure 5a-f). 83 Interestingly, the β-form showed the highest piezoelectric shear coefficient with a d16 ~ 200 pm V -1 , which is comparable in magnitude to inorganic ceramic oxides and larger than many organic bio-piezoelectric materials. However, the β-phase of glycine is unstable at ambient conditions and can spontaneously change into the α-or γ-phase. A glycine PEH device was fabricated by placing γ-glycine seed crystals between two copper electrodes with an active area of 324 mm 2 , which produced a maximum open-circuit voltage of 0.45 V upon applying a manual load of ~ 0.17 N (Figure 5f).While many materials can be utilized for piezoelectric energy harvesting applications, a number lack biocompatibility that limits their utility in wearable electronics, including ZnO, AlN, InN, ZnS, CdS and ceramic metal oxides. As a result, bioinspired organic piezoelectric materials have emerged as promising mechanically responsive candidates for wearable electronic applications. Naturally occuring piezo-and ferro-electric materials exhibit a range of potential advantages such as biocompatibility, biosafety, biodegradability, functional molecular recognition and robust mechanical properties. A large number of environmentally friendly bioorganic materials have shown piezoelectric properties and can potentially be utilized for electromechanical energy harvesting applications; these include materials such as bone, wood, silk, cellulose, chitin, elastin, clamshell, amino acids, peptides, chitosan, alginate, fibrillar collagen, and viruses. 79,80 Among these materials, supramolecular self-assembled amino acids and peptides are of interest since they exhibit high piezoelectric polarization due to their permanent dipole moment.

        <p>In 2019, Gazit and coworkers demonstrated the presence of ordered supramolecular selfassembled interactions in several aromatic amino acids such as L-phenylalanine (L-Phe), Ltyrosine (L-Tyr) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) (Figure 6). 84 A single-crystal Xray diffraction analysis of L-Tyr indicated that the material has a non-centrosymmetric structure, with attractive arrays of tightly packed hydrogen-bonded assemblies. This molecular recognition of L-Tyr crystals formed via the formation of distinct face-to-face hydrogen bond dimers results in a number of advantages which include unusual water solubility, high thermal stability (~ 581 K), robust mechanical properties, and stable power generation. Furthermore, a PEH device was fabricated by embedding the L-Tyr crystals onto a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) protective layer sandwiched between two Ag-coated electrodes, which were connected to a low noise voltage amplifier (Figure 6b). By applying a compressive force of 31 N, an opencircuit voltage of 0.5 V and short-circuit current of 35 nA were obtained for this device (Figure 6c). State-of-the-art or stimuli-responsive materials, including those sensitive to temperature, pH, solvent, light, mechanical force, electric fields and magnetic fields have gained significant interest due to their potential applications in stretchable and wearable bio-integrated devices, tissue engineering, drug delivery and soft robotics. 85 In this regard, the L-Tyr-based composite material on a PDMS polymer also exihibited mechano-responsiveness, namely a response to an applied mechanical force. Composite films were obtained by coating a rigid, thin film of L-Tyr crystals on the surface of a PDMS polymer (Figure 6d). Surprisingly, the composite film exhibited an improved mechano-responsive bending behavior when subjected to a tensile-stress test compared to a pure PDMS film under the same mechanical conditions (Figure 6e). The difference in mechano-responsive behaviour can be associated with the contrast in mechanical properties of L-Tyr crystals on the PDMS substrate, compared to the neat (pure) PDMS film.In 2019, Gazit and coworkers demonstrated the presence of ordered supramolecular selfassembled interactions in several aromatic amino acids such as L-phenylalanine (L-Phe), Ltyrosine (L-Tyr) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) (Figure 6). 84 A single-crystal Xray diffraction analysis of L-Tyr indicated that the material has a non-centrosymmetric structure, with attractive arrays of tightly packed hydrogen-bonded assemblies.

Due to the difficulties in studying each stacking mode in single molecules, hybrid systems were selected to study their physico-chemical properties. The stacking modes of these hybrid systems improve a number of structural aspects such as enhanced chirality, red-shift emission, thermal resistance and mechanical properties. In addition, the non-centrosymmetric nature of all three crystals leads to an intrinsic polarization potential for piezo-and ferro-electric properties. The piezoelectric properties of these salts were analyzed by density functional theory studies. The observed piezoelectric coefficient (dmax) and piezoelectric voltage constant (gmax, a measure of electric field per unit stress) values for 4,4'-Bpy, AcA and 4,4'-Bpy/AcA were 20.9, 9.5 and 14.9 pC N -1 , and 1.15, 0.48, and 0.67 V m N - 1 , respectively.

As a result, the FF nanotubes exhibited a unidirectional polarization potential for piezoelectric energy harvesting applications. A PEH was fabricated using horizontally aligned FF nanotubes on an Au/Cr coated flexible polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrate (Figure 9b). The resulting piezoelectric device produced an output voltage, output current and power of 2.8 V, 37.4 nA, and 8.2 nW, respectively (Figure 9c). The potential of the FF nanotube device was demonstrated by powering multiple liquid-crystal display (LCD) panels, which display "FF PEH" by simply finger-pressing the device (Figure 9d). Gazit and coworkers developed a cyclo glycine-tryptophan (cyclo-GW) based dipeptide which forms a thermally stable (~ 643 K) and mechanically robust structure (elastic modulus up to ~ 24.0 GPa) due to its supramolecular β-sheet hydrogen-bonded and herringbone edge-to-face aromatic interactions (Figure 10). 91 Single crystals of the cyclo-GW dipeptide were synthesized by dissolving cyclo-GW powder in a 10% (v/v) methanol/water solvent, heating to 80 °C, whereupon needle-like crystals slowly appeared. Gradual cooling to room temperature yielded larger crystals after 30 days.

        <p>In addition to these reports, in 2020, Gazit and coworkers developed a strategy to manufacture short and phenyl-rich aromatic dipeptides based on the β,β-diphenyl-Ala-OH (Dip) unit, namely Dip-Dip, cyclo-Dip-Dip, and tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc)-Dip-Dip moieties (Figure 11e-g). 93 These aromatic rich dipeptides crystallized in an acentric space group and displayed strong mechanical and piezoelectric properties. Interestingly, Boc-Dip-Dip shows many advantageous features such as a small number of molecules per unit-cell, crystal dipole orientation, and high piezoelectric polarization compared to well-studied aromatic-rich dipeptides. To exploit its high piezoelectric coefficients (d33 ~ 73.1 pC N -1 ), the authors fabricated a mechanical energy harvesting device that produced a maximum output voltage of 1 V and a current of 60 nA under an applied load of 40 N (Figure 11h). In addition, its piezoelectric voltage coefficient, which is a measure of the electric field generated per unit stress (g33 = d33/33), was computed to be 2-3 Vm N -1 , higher than many well-known perovskite inorganic ceramic oxides, PVDF and smallmolecules based organic and organic-inorganic hybrid compounds. 54 More recently, the same group demonstrated the molecular engineering of piezoelectricity in collagen-mimicking peptide assemblies. 94 The peptide-based piezoelectric generator was developed using a simple FF-derived peptides N-terminated by proline (Pro) or hydroxyproline (Hyp) moieties, namely Pro-Phe-Phe (P-F-F) and Hyp-Phe-Phe (Hyp-F-F). Figure 12 shows the molecular structure, calculated theoretical piezoelectric coefficient and piezoelectric energy harvesting generator of Pro-Phe-Phe and Hyp-Phe-Phe assemblies. Both Pro-Phe-Phe and Hyp-Phe-Phe tripeptides assemblies displayed helical-like sheet structures stabilized by the hydrophobic nature of Phe residues. These self-assembled tripeptide structures exhibited excellent mechanical strength and high piezoelectric response, which was maximized in the case Hyp-Phe-Phe, due to the robust H-bonding seen for the Hyp substituent (Figure 12b andc). Thus, as expected in the case of Hyp-Phe-Phe, the addition of a hydroxyl group increased the piezoelectric response by an order of magnitude (d16 and d35 = 27 pm V -1 ), due to the elevated number of non-zero piezoelectric constants in each tensor and an increase in crystal polarizability under stress (Figure 12c).In addition to these reports, in 2020, Gazit and coworkers developed a strategy to manufacture short and phenyl-rich aromatic dipeptides based on the β,β-diphenyl-Ala-OH (Dip) unit, namely Dip-Dip, cyclo-Dip-Dip, and tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc)-Dip-Dip moieties (Figure 11e-g). 93 These aromatic rich dipeptides crystallized in an acentric space group and displayed strong mechanical and piezoelectric properties.

        <p>Recently, Boomishankar and coworkers demonstrated a piezoelectric energy harvester based on a binary phosphonium salt, diphenyl diisopropylamino phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (DPDP•PF6), in the form of its PDMS polymer composites (Figure 13). 96 Interestingly, the DPDP•PF6 salt crystallized in an acentric monoclinic Cc space group, an essential factor for the materials to exhibit piezo-and ferro-electric properties. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of DPDP•PF6 salt showed the formation of a one-dimensional (1D)-hydrogen bonded network mediated by strong N-H•••F interactions along the polar b-axis (Figure 13b). The ferroelectric polarization (P) versus electric field (E) measurements of DPDP•PF6 exhibited a well saturated rectangular hysteresis loop, with a remnant polarization of Pr ~ 6 μC cm -2 at room temperature (Figure 13c). Furthermore, direct piezoelectric measurements on a singlecrystal of this organic salt reveal a piezoelectric coefficient of d33 ~ 8 pC N -1 by applying a mechanical force of 0.20 N at a frequency of 110 Hz. Due to its appreciable piezo-and ferroelectric properties, the application of DPDP•PF6 in a piezoelectric energy harvesting device was examined. Composite films of 3, 5, 7, 10 and 20 weight percentage (wt %) of DPDP•PF6 were prepared using a PDMS polymer and tested at an operating frequency of 10 Hz and a mechanical force of 15 N. The output performance of the composite device was shown to increase with the fraction of the active material, from 3 wt % to 10 wt %. At higher weight fractions the output decreased, which can be due to the reduction in the dipole moment and long-range order interactions in the composite materials. The observed output device performance was supported by X-ray 3D-microtomography analysis, which suggests the particle agglomeration is higher for the 20 wt % DPDP•PF6/PDMS than the 10 wt % DPDP•PF6/PDMS composite film (Figure 13d ande). Among the range of composites examined, the 10 wt % DPDP•PF6/PDMS composite device yielded an output voltage of 8.5 V and a power density of 1.74 μW cm -3 , respectively (Figure 13f). These results show the practical energy harvesting abilities of a simple organic binary phosphonium salt. anions (Figure 14). 97 These tetrahedral anions have been shown to lower the symmetry of most of these binary salts with respect to the octahedral PF6 -anion, and are suitable for achieving a ferroelectric response. However, the salts based on the DPDP cation with all the anions (PF6 -, BF4 -, ClO4 -and IO4 -) studied in this series crystallized in the monoclinic non-centrosymmetric space group (Cc) signifying the vital role played by this phosphonium cation in directing the structure. Ferroelectric measurements on single-crystals of these organic salts indicated a high remnant polarization that ranged from Pr ~ 21.12 μC cm -2 to 35.36 μC cm -2 . The variation in the ferroelectric polarization was attributed to the formation of different donor and acceptor interactions between phosphonium cations and the tetrahedral anions.

Furthermore, ferroelectric hysteresis loop measurements ofRecently, Boomishankar and coworkers demonstrated a piezoelectric energy harvester based on a binary phosphonium salt, diphenyl diisopropylamino phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (DPDP•PF6), in the form of its PDMS polymer composites (Figure 13). 96 Interestingly, the DPDP•PF6 salt crystallized in an acentric monoclinic Cc space group, an essential factor for the materials to exhibit piezo-and ferro-electric properties. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of DPDP•PF6 salt showed the formation of a one-dimensional (1D)-hydrogen bonded network mediated by strong N-H•••F interactions along the polar b-axis (Figure 13b). The ferroelectric polarization (P) versus electric field (E) measurements of DPDP•PF6 exhibited a well saturated rectangular hysteresis loop, with a remnant polarization of Pr ~ 6 μC cm -2 at room temperature (Figure 13c). Furthermore, direct piezoelectric measurements on a singlecrystal of this organic salt reveal a piezoelectric coefficient of d33 ~ 8 pC N -1 by applying a mechanical force of 0.20 N at a frequency of 110 Hz. Due to its appreciable piezo-and ferroelectric properties, the application of DPDP•PF6 in a piezoelectric energy harvesting device was examined. Composite films of 3, 5, 7, 10 and 20 weight percentage (wt %) of DPDP•PF6 were prepared using a PDMS polymer and tested at an operating frequency of 10 Hz and a mechanical force of 15 N. The output performance of the composite device was shown to increase with the fraction of the active material, from 3 wt % to 10 wt %. At higher weight fractions the output decreased, which can be due to the reduction in the dipole moment and long-range order interactions in the composite materials. The observed output device performance was supported by X-ray 3D-microtomography analysis, which suggests the particle agglomeration is higher for the 20 wt % DPDP•PF6/PDMS than the 10 wt % DPDP•PF6/PDMS composite film (Figure 13d ande).

        <p>In 2020, Boomishankar and coworkers synthesized a ferroelectric 3d metal ion-containing A4MX6 type organic-inorganic hybrid compound [Ph3MeP]4[Ni(NCS)6], that crystallized in an acentric polar monoclinic space group Cc (Figure 35). Notably, the observed output performance of these composite devices is comparable, or even higher, than some of the best performing low molecular weight organic-inorganic hybrid-based piezoelectric energy harvesting systems. Stimulated by the above work, ferroelectric A2MX4-type halogenometallate hybrid salts containing Cu(II) ions and heteroleptic phosphonium cations were explored by their group for piezoelectric energy harvesting (Figure 36). 148 These lead-free Cu(II) halides, [Ph3MeP]2[CuCl4] (1) and [Ph3MeP]2[CuBr4] (2) were synthesized as yellow and violet crystals from their respective copper and phosphonium halide precursors. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses of hybrid Salt 1 and Salt 2 were described in polar orthorhombic space groups Fdd2 and monoclinic Cc, respectively. Their molecular structure consists of [PPh3Me] + cations and the isolated complex anions of [CuCl4] 2-and [CuBr4] 2-, respectively (Figure 36a andb). The P-E hysteresis loops of Salt 1 and Salt 2 resulted in the Pr values of 17.16 and 26.02 μC cm -2 and the Ec of 1.67 and 2.00 kV cm -1 , respectively (Figure 36c andd). In addition, the temperature and frequency-dependent dielectric measurements of Salt 1 and Salt 2 show an absence of Curie points, which is rare in most well-known organic and organic-inorganic hybrid ferroelectric materials. The direct piezoresponse of Salt 1 and Salt 2 (pellet samples) was recorded by a quasi-static method, leading to d33 values of d33 ~1.73 and d33 ~ 1.80 pC N -1 for Salt 1 and Salt 2, at room temperature. Furthermore, composite piezoelectric harvesting devices based on Salt 1 were fabricated with a TPU matrix. The non-poled device of 15 wt % 1-TPU showed a maximum voltage of 25 V, current density 1.0 μA cm -2 and the power density of 14.1 μW cm -2 , when measured at an optimized external load of 14.15 N and a frequency of 10 Hz (Figure 36e). Further, all the Salt 1-TPU composite devices were tested under different external load resistances (0.1 to 157 MΩ). The detected output voltages and currents were shown to increase and decrease until the threshold level resistance of 157 MΩ, beyond which it saturates (Figure 36f). Furthermore, the best performing 15 wt% 1-TPU offered excellent retention of piezoelectric voltages, even after three months (durability test), and cyclic stability over 10000 cycles.

        <p>In this direction, recently, Bu and coworkers reported on a new hybrid organic-inorganic metal halide PEHs, (BTMA)2CoBr4 (BTMA = benzyltrimethylammonium) (Figure 37). 149 Singlecrystal X-ray diffraction analysis of (BTMA)2CoBr4 showed that the molecule crystallized in a non-centrosymmetric space group P21 and adopted a discrete or zero-dimensional crystal packing structure (Figure 37a andb). The structural stabilization arise from the electrostatic interactions between organic [BTMA] + cation and the inorganic [CoBr4] 2-tetrahedron. These strong intermolecular interactions lead to the non-existence of any structural phase transition of (BTMA)2CoBr4 before its melting point. Moreover, DFT calculations of (BTMA)2CoBr4 showed the highest predicted elastic modulus, Emax and Emin, values of 17.56 and 4.11 GPa, respectively, along the &lt;-101&gt; and &lt;101&gt; directions. Such a difference in E could be realized in the arrangement of [CoBr4] 2-tetrahedron. In particular, the distance between the two nearest Co atoms are observed to be 8.898 and 12.071 Å along the &lt;-101&gt; direction, whereas these distances were found to be much higher (17.226 Å) along &lt;101&gt;, resulting in a lower Young's modulus in this direction. Furthermore, PFM analysis showed the existence of intrinsic piezoand ferro-electric properties of (BTMA)2CoBr4. Figure 37c andd, shows the bias voltagedependent phase hysteresis and amplitude butterfly curves, which confirms its polarization switching characteristics. PDMS composite films of (BTMA)2CoBr4 were prepared and evaluated for piezoelectric energy harvesting. The composite films were connected between two copper electrodes and encapsulated with PET tape, which formed a sandwich device architecture. Figure 37e andf, shows the presence of (BTMA)2CoBr4 particles in flexible PDMS composite films as observed from the scanning electron microscopy and mapping images. Moreover, the 10 % (BTMA)2CoBr4/PDMS device exhibited the highest output opencircuit voltage and short-circuit current values of 19.70 V and 4.24 μA, respectively (Figure 37g). In addition, the device performance was performed with different external forces, which demonstrated the linear piezoresponse of the (BTMA)2CoBr4/PDMS device (Figure 37h). In addition, the (BTMA)2CoBr4/PDMS device was utilized to detect human motion (finger bending), demonstrating its potential for precise sensing of bio-mechanical movements. 2.

        <p>6. Despite making significant strides in piezoelectric energy harvesting technologies, longterm stability and durability is an important issue for successful application of these new materials. The majority of organic and organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite materials are sensitive to oxygen, moisture, light, thermal fluctuations, electric fields, acids and bases, which lead to the degradation of these materials during service. In particular, a number of organic-inorganic hybrid compounds can easily decompose when exposed to oxygen and moisture due to the reactivity of the hygroscopic amine group and metalhalide bonds. Recent developments aimed at addressing these issues have focused on doping or element substitution, engineering the interface between the organic and organic-inorganic hybrid particles and the polymer matrices, or modification of A-or M-or X-site ions. The formation and stability of ABX3-type perovskite structures are dictated by the Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t) as a common geometric guideline. Ideal perovskite compounds adopt a t value between 0.8 and 1.0, and a Goldschmidt tolerance factor of t &gt; 1 or t &lt; 0.8 results in non-perovskite systems that adopt diverse types of compositions such as A2BX4, A3MX6, and A4BX6 with different structures.6.

        <p>typically show the best device performance, these metals are toxic. In general, leadbased organic-inorganic piezoelectric energy harvesters have been explored due to their excellent electromechanical properties. However, toxic Pb(II) components lead to environmental issues, limiting their use in medical and wearable electronic-skin applications. Therefore, their replacement with less toxic and environmentally friendly materials is of interest. Indeed, in the search for new piezoelectric lead-free organicinorganic hybrid energy harvesters, methylammonium tin iodide (MASnI3) provides a range of advantages, such as reduced toxicity, decreased ecological damage, greater disposability and high piezoelectric coefficients (d33 ~ 100.9 pC N -1 ). Despite these developments, a challenge is the long-term stability to both air and moisture and the presence of less toxic elements. One approaches to tackle this problem is the introduction of light-weight first-row transition metal ions, combined with pseudohalogenometallate counter-anions within the framework of organic-inorganic hybrid structures. In particular, by employing first-row 3d metal-ion-based piezoelectric materials for mechanical energy harvesting applications. Such approaches have the potential to find a way to develop new high stability, heavy metal-free and non-toxic energy harvesters.typically show the best device performance, these metals are toxic.

        <p>14. There is a need to provide performance data in a systematic fashion. At present, a direct comparison between piezoelectric energy harvesters can be hindered by data collected from different modes of operation, such as the applied mechanical force, frequency, layer thickness, device area, poled and unpoled device structure, structural morphologies and the weight ratio between polymer and piezoelectric filler. In order to provide valid benchmarking and comparison, consistency in data collection should be a consideration of future reports on piezoelectric harvesters.14.
