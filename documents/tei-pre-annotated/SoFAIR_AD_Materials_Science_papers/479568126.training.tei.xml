        <p>It has been established that CO 2 emission levels [35] to the atmosphere can be significantly decreased by substitution of traditional fuels such as diesel, gasoline and carbon with higher (H/C) ratio fuels such as natural gas or biomass, as shown in Fig. 3. Therefore, production of hydrogen from hydrocarbons is regarded as the most economic and efficient way of achieving a significant degree of reduction in the emissions of greenhouse gases. Natural gas is a nonrenewable energy source; essentially a blend of lighter hydrocarbons existing in the basement of gas accumulations present in porous rock which might or might not be associated with oil. It is mainly constituted of saturated hydrocarbons, mainly methane, with butane and propane in insignificant quantities, and other compounds composed of inorganic gases. Production of synthesis gas comprising of a mixture of CO along with purified H 2 being obtained from natural gas by using various catalyst and is currently the most preferred choice (Table 1). With the advent of the hydrogen economy, there has been an increased focus on the transformation of petroleum gas into more ecologically friendly hydrogen fuel.It has been established that CO 2 emission levels [35] to the atmosphere can be significantly decreased by substitution of traditional fuels such as diesel, gasoline and carbon with higher (H/C) ratio fuels such as natural gas or biomass, as shown in Fig. 3.

        <p>The Global carbon dioxide emissions from various industrial processes and fossil fuel combustion have been estimated to be around 35.7 billion tons [36] annually, which has contributed to increased global warming [242,243]. Therefore, it is imperative to develop clean technologies for the utilisation of fossil fuels [245e247] and to introduce alternative greener fuels for inhibiting the adverse effects of greenhouse gas emissions and subsequent climatic changes. Among various alternative fuels, hydrogen [37] is considered to be a sustainable energy carrier and offers near zero end-use emissions of greenhouse gases and pollutants [38].The Global carbon dioxide emissions from various industrial processes and fossil fuel combustion have been estimated to be around 35.7 billion tons [36] annually, which has contributed to increased global warming [242,243].

        <p>For the creation of clean fuel, like hydrogen, natural gas needs to undergo a catalytic process described as natural gas reforming. Reforming is the most common technique used in industries for production of synthesis gas via through one of three reforming processes i.e., partial oxidation of methane (POM) [39], steam reforming of methane (SRM) [40e48] and CO 2 reforming of methane (DRM) [49e55]. SRM is a fully developed generation technique which utilises steam at high temperature (700e1000 C) for the production of H 2 from natural gas. During SRM, CH 4 interacts with steam with pressures ranging from 3 to 25 bar using catalyst to produce H 2 , CO and a moderate quantity of CO 2 . Eventually during the water-gas shifting reaction, steam and CO 2 interact to generate CO and more H 2 using an efficient catalyst. Steam reforming of methane requires rigorous energy input because of its endo-thermicity and higher H 2 O/CH 4 ratio which results in better yields of H 2 , thereby making the SRM process energetically unfavourable [56e62] and accelerates the catalyst deactivation process [51].For the creation of clean fuel, like hydrogen, natural gas needs to undergo a catalytic process described as natural gas reforming.

        <p>POM can deliver syn gas with a H 2 /CO proportion of 2.0. Nonetheless, controlling this process is an arduous task due to the danger associated with explosions [70] and the presence of hot spots Also, Partial oxidation of methane needs an air separation unit (ASU), which markedly impacts the expenses associated with the reforming plant. Because of these disadvantages associated with POM, combined steam and dryreforming of methane (CSDRM), where H 2 O is used in conjunction with CO 2 , has been considered as a worthwhile strategy for the mass production of syn gas with a H 2 /CO proportion of 2.0 [71,72]. The CSDRM can generate syn gas with flexible H 2 /CO proportions, which can be effectively controlled by modifying the feed gas (H 2 O, CO 2 and CH 4 ) composition. The utilized procedure is alternatively known as bi-reforming (BRM) where a 3/2/1 proportion of CH 4 along with CO 2 and steam produces a gas blend with basically a 2/1 proportion of H 2 to CO. This formed gas is also called 'met gas' to underline its distinction from broadly utilized syngas blends of different H 2 /CO proportions. The formation of syngas with this ratio has potential applications in Fischer-Tropsch operations for the preparation of long hydrocarbon chains [73e75]. as well as in the production of methanol [76e78].POM can deliver syn gas with a H 2 /CO proportion of 2.0.

        <p>Furthermore, bi-reforming [79e94] of CH 4 has captivated massive interest from both environmental and industrial perspectives. CO 2 and CH 4 are the most abundant carboncontaining, ozone-depleting substances from an environmental perspective, which can be used successfully in this reaction and can undergo conversion to useful chemical products. In reality, the combination of both steam and dry reforming provides a more pragmatic route for enhancing the H 2 /CO ratio compared to the introduction of CH 4 [95e97].

        <p>It has been reported [98] that at lower temperatures higher conversion of methane can be achieved in the bi-reforming process. In addition to the operating conditions, catalysts also play a crucial role in bi-reforming reactions. One of the most important advantages of bi-reforming [85,98e104] is that the consumption of major greenhouse gases occurs, thereby creating a significant environmental impact. These gases are water vapour, which accounts for 36e70% of the feed gas, CO 2 at 9e26%, CH 4 at 4e9% and ozone (O 3 ) for the rest (3e7%) [105]. Hence, there has been a renewed interest in the application of these gases via bi-reforming of methane towards the production of value-added chemicals that are useful for both scientific and industrial communities.It has been reported [98] that at lower temperatures higher conversion of methane can be achieved in the bi-reforming process.

        <p>Additionally, bi-reforming technology can be regarded as a method for enhancing the caloric value of biogas, which is composed of CO 2 , H 2 and CH 4 through the solar reforming process [106,107]. One of the biggest stumbling blocks for the methane reforming process is related to the sudden catalyst deactivation, which might be due to sintering and coke formation on the active sites [108,109]. CH 4 decomposition (Eq. ( 3)), CO disproportionation (Eq. ( 4)) and CO reduction (Eq. ( 6)) are the primary processes that lead to coke formation. The reaction in Equation ( 3) shows an endothermic reaction that is highly favourable at higher temperatures and lower pressures, whereas Equations ( 4) and ( 5) are exothermic in nature and favoured at lower temperatures [110] and higher pressures through the reverse water gas shift reaction (Eq.

        <p>Since catalysts deactivation is caused by formation of coke from the above reactions (4), (5) and 6, hence, it is desirable to establish promising catalysts that demonstrate greater selectivity, excellent stability and activity during the production of syngas. Several investigations [49,50,111], have been reported for assessing the most suitable catalyst for syngas production employing different technologies. Common catalysts that have been used in reforming reactions include catalysts such as copper, nickel supported by transition metals and other supported noble metal catalysts such as ruthenium, platinum, rhenium. Several noteworthy reviews reporting on various innovations recorded in catalyst development for DRM reactions have mainly focussed on catalysts configurations [112], the influence of process parameters [50], noble metal catalysts [49], coke deposition and management [111], development of oxygen carriers in chemical looping [113], Ni and Ni-based catalysts [51], low temperature dry reforming [114], and advances in synthesis of catalysts with mesoporous SBA-15 support [115]. Fidalgo et al. [36], conducted a review on carbon black catalysts and activated carbon which have the unique characteristic of operating without being deactivated by carbon deposition. The catalysts role on methane decomposition and carbon dioxide reforming of CH 4 was assessed, and the characteristics of carbon deposits during CO 2 reforming of CH 4 were listed. The influence of nanocatalysts [38] on the oxidative coupling, steam reforming and CO 2 reforming of CH 4 has been previously reported, which suggested that methane conversion over a nanocatalyst occurred significantly than the ordinary catalyst and there existed no interdependence between the average particle size of nanoparticles and the conversion of methane.Since catalysts deactivation is caused by formation of coke from the above reactions (4), (5) and 6, hence, it is desirable to establish promising catalysts that demonstrate greater selectivity, excellent stability and activity during the production of syngas.

        <p>Though Ni-based catalysts [116] are inexpensive, they display exhibit superior performance in comparison to precious metal catalysts. Nevertheless, sintering and formation of carbon affects the sudden deactivation of catalysts. Since bireforming employs low S/C ratios for adjusting the H 2 /CO ratio, hence catalysts involving Ni undergo deactivation by carbon deposition [76]. Two main methods have been documented to diminish the deactivation of catalyst due to formation of coke. One method described the effect of promoters such as lanthanum [117], cerium, magnesium and calcium [118,119], on the characteristics of the catalysts during the reforming process and other was aimed at controlling the particle size at the nano-level in the active metals.Though Ni-based catalysts [116] are inexpensive, they display exhibit superior performance in comparison to precious metal catalysts.

        <p>It has been established that during bi-reforming [120e122] and DRM, deactivation of Ni supported catalysts occur due to coke formation. Hence, it is highly imperative for the development of most active and stable catalysts in bi-reforming. Several authors [120,121,123], have developed nickel catalyst of high activity and stability supported by CeeZrO 2 , ZrO 2 and MgO during the DRM process. Several literature studies on the effect of nickel catalysts and their promoters during bireforming of methane have been documented in the present review. For example, Roh et al. [121] employed numerous supported Ni catalysts during bi-reforming reactions for production of syngas having H 2 /CO ¼ 2. The supported Ni catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness method with Ni(NO 3 ) 2 . The Ni catalysts were supported by small nanoparticles of ZrO 2 or MgO which were highly active and stable for BRM. Fig. 4 illustrates scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images of catalysts used in the reaction and the coke formation observed when subjected to 800 C. The authors observed that the degree of carbon formation and shape varied with different catalysts. Ni catalyst with MgOeAl 2 O 3 as support generated filamentous coke but of insignificant intensity (Fig. 4a). However, Ni catalyst with MgO as support generated a lot of coke from the filaments (Fig. 4b) during occurrence of BRM reaction while Ni/ZrO 2 exhibited a worm-like coke feature (Fig. 4c). Similar shape of coke (Fig. 4d) was observed for Ni/CeO 2 catalyst.

        <p>The authors [121] also made a comparative study between the Ni/MgOeAl 2 O 3 catalyst and the commercial Ni catalyst supported with MgAl 2 O 4 (Fig. 5) at various temperatures. The methane conversion was 83% and the conversion of carbon dioxide was 71% in presence Ni catalyst supported by MgOeAl From Fig. 6 it was clearly observed that the CH 4 conversion was highest for Ni catalyst supported by MgO Al 2 O 3 and approximately 90% methane underwent conversion which continued for 2 h. However, rapid catalyst deactivation occurred in the case of Ni a-alumina catalyst with changes in time attributed to carbon formation. Moreover, Ni/MgO catalyst exhibited around 60% CH 4 conversion and Ni/ZrO 2 demonstrated around 70% CH 4 conversion. Both the catalysts were found to be highly stable during the reforming process. Nevertheless, the conversion of methane for Ni catalyst supported by CeO 2 was initially 57% which decreased to 50% followed by its saturation. Results revealed that Ni/MgOeAl 2 O 3 possessing lowest nickel oxide crystallite size exhibited highest stability along with higher CH 4 conversion with time on stream.The authors [121] also made a comparative study between the Ni/MgOeAl 2 O 3 catalyst and the commercial Ni catalyst supported with MgAl 2 O 4 (Fig. 5) at various temperatures.

Moreover, Ni/MgO catalyst exhibited around 60% CH 4 conversion and Ni/ZrO 2 demonstrated around 70% CH 4 conversion. Both the catalysts were found to be highly stable during the reforming process. Nevertheless, the conversion of methane for Ni catalyst supported by CeO 2 was initially 57% which decreased to 50% followed by its saturation. Results revealed that Ni/MgOeAl 2 O 3 possessing lowest nickel oxide crystallite size exhibited highest stability along with higher CH 4 conversion with time on stream.</p>

        <p>The purpose of this study was to examine the performance of bi-reforming of methane over a catalytic nickel membrane for the GTL (gas to liquid) process. GTL process possess two advantages. One is that carbon formation is reduced due to the oxidation of carbon precursor species and a desirable H 2 /CO can be achieved by adjusting CH 4 /H 2 O/CO 2 ratio in the feed stream. Porous wall of catalytic nickel membrane was chosen for reforming studies since hydrogen passed through the catalytic nickel membrane was faster than the other gases because of viscous and Knudsen flow. Generally, the catalyst that contained relatively small size pore was more affected by internal diffusion than the one which has large sized pores.The purpose of this study was to examine the performance of bi-reforming of methane over a catalytic nickel membrane for the GTL (gas to liquid) process.

Ni/Al 2 O 3 based catalysts are relatively cheap because precious metals are not used and these catalysts can operate stably with high activity under excess steam. Ni/g-Al 2 O 3 catalyst used in this study was prepared by incipient wetness method. Thermodynamically, the catalyst promoted very high conversion of CH 4 (98.3%) and CO 2 (82.4%) when subjected to bi-reforming of methane for 200 h and resulting in H 2 /CO ratio of 2.01. Furthermore, the results revealed that the conventional catalyst system produced 15.4% coke after 200 h while the mass of carbon deposited was around 3.6% for catalysts exposed to steam. This novel steam pre-treatment technique significantly increased the resistance towards carbon formation in the presence of catalysts, thereby improving both long-term stability and activity.Son et al.

        <p>In particular, Cerium oxide has been widely recognized as an efficient promoter for Ni-based catalysts. This is because the redox properties of Ce 4þ /Ce 3þ results in easier gasification of the settled coke on the surface of the catalyst and also helps in storage and delivering of active oxygen thereby enhancing the dispersion of Ni.

The authors found that the catalytic activities of NieCe/MgAl 2 O 4 catalyst were the highest and it generated enormous coke resistance during the bi-reforming reaction performed at lower temperatures with Ce/Ni ratio of 0.25.

Results from catalytic tests performed at 900 C and at a pressure of 5 atmospheric pressure for 40 h with a CH 4 : H 2 O: CO 2 :H 2 :CO: N 2 ratio of 1:1.2:0.4:2:0.3:0.3 also revealed that aged Nie2.5La/ MgAl 2 O 4 catalyst showed maximum sinter stability and activity due to its enhanced nickel dispersion and surface area.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the role of Ce/Zr ratio on the catalytic activity of NieCe x Zr 1Àx O 2 catalyst and coke formation was demonstrated by Roh et al. [131], during the bi-reforming reaction. The authors used co-precipitation method to synthesise NieCeeZrO 2 catalysts having different ratios of CeO 2 /ZrO 2 for syngas production having potential applications in gas to liquid (GTL) processes. 15% NieCe 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 demonstrated excellent stability and highest activity during BRM which was attributed to the dispersion of nickel oxide having higher oxygen storage capacity and intimate contact with the support. Recently, it has been reported [131] that Cerium content along with nickel-cerium loading technique has an significant effect on the transfer of O 2 occurring between nickel (Ni) and cerium (Ce). Studies have also shown an improvement in coke resistance of 12 wt % Nickel/a-Al 2 O 3 catalyst in the bi-reforming reaction. [133,149], However, the characteristics of supports play a marked effect on coke formation [132]. For example, a-Al 2 O 3 support caused carbon deposition due to its acidity [150]; active nickel metal and Al 2 O 3 supports underwent interaction to form inactive NiAl 2 O 4 , resulting in deactivation of the catalyst [134]. Additionally, Baek et al. [151], observed higher coke resistance and enhanced catalytic stability of NieCe/ MgAl 2 O 4 (MgO/Al 2 O 3 ¼ 3/7) in comparison to NieCe/q-Al 2 O 3 in bi-reforming process.Furthermore, the role of Ce/Zr ratio on the catalytic activity of NieCe x Zr 1Àx O 2 catalyst and coke formation was demonstrated by Roh et al.

The authors noted that by adjusting the parameters properly, highest conversion i.e. 99% and 94% of CH 4 and CO 2 to syngas was achieved in presence of NieCe/ZSM-5 catalyst. Furthermore, the catalyst did not show any deactivation and maintained high activity for 40 h.

        <p>Low cost and widely available Mg 2þ and Ca 2þ containing salts were used as the additives based on their potential to yield basic properties (in their oxide form) and their positive impact on bi-reforming process [155]. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) of calcined Ni-loaded samples displayed a strong reduction peak at higher temperatures ranging from 550 to 800 C (Fig. 16bef), which was ascribed to the reduction of oxidised nickel (Ni) undergoing stronger interaction with the support present in the mixed spinel phase [156]. The author observed that there was no peak signifying weakly-bounded Ni species below a reduction temperature of around 500 C, which was similar to the finding for non-porous impregnated alumina samples [82,157]. The authors in their studies noted that after the reduction process, the catalysts demonstrated higher dispersion of Ni within the arranged oxide cavity, possessed elevated activities and also showed long-lasting stability in bi-reforming of CH 4 performed at 800 C. They also observed that a relationship existed between carbon deposition and reactivity level in the presence of Mg free catalysts. SEM (Fig. 17A,B) and TEM (Fig. 17C,D) images for spent Ni 10% Al 2 O 3 clearly identified long carbon filaments on the exterior area of the alumina containing grains, with some grains which were found to more protected than others. These images also showed some Ni nanoparticles containing coke were situated either at the boundary between the support and the filament embedded into it. These images also resembled carbon nanotubes nucleation with a 'closed end' consisting a nanoparticle at either their closure or located inside the tip [158e160]. For both Ni 5% Mg 5% Al 2 O 3 and Ni 5% Ca 5% Al 2 O 3 , a peak was observed at very high temperatures of above 800 C, as shown in Fig. 18A (e and f); this was a possible indication of free metallic Ni existing under stronger interactions or may have been related to the reduction of Mg-or Ca-derived species. Furthermore, a linear correlation was established between H 2 uptake and Ni content, which confirmed that all Ni used in the synthesis was completely reclaimed in the solid after preparation. The authors also reported that, due to the endothermic nature of the bi-reforming reaction, the conversion of both CH 4 and CO 2 decreased at lower temperatures, and CO 2 conversion was more significant below 700 C.Low cost and widely available Mg 2þ and Ca 2þ containing salts were used as the additives based on their potential to yield basic properties (in their oxide form) and their positive impact on bi-reforming process [155].

        <p>Results also revealed that there was a beneficial effect when 5 wt% magnesium or calcium was used for the conversion of both CH 4 and CO 2 represented by d and e (Fig. 18A,B), compared to catalyst containing 5 wt % Nickel and without additive. The enhancement in the reactivity in presence of 5 wt (wt%) magnesium or calcium was higher than with Ni 7.5% Al 2 O 3 despite the lower Ni content reported in previous literature [161e163]. Jabbour et al. [154], established that in addition to high activity levels, doping of the Ni catalysts with Mg or Ca additive resulted in excellent catalytic stability for high temperature bi-reforming operations. The authors found that mesoporous catalysts synthesized by one-pot method served as an ideal candidate for catalysing met gas production from biomass-related natural resources. The beneficial effect of nickel confinement in the pores was twofold, one in protecting the metal nanoparticles against sintering phenomenon and second against coking due to steric constraints. Kang et al.

The authors observed that Ni catalysts constituting of 10% Ni loaded on Aluminium oxide or MgOeAl 2 O 3 exhibited exemplary performance during the steam reforming of methane, achieving 97% conversion of CH 4 at a temperature of 750 C. Additionally, methane conversion was 96% at 850 C during dry reforming of CH 4 and demonstrated greater thermal stability for the initial duration of 50e150 h. The results also established that supported Ni catalysts demonstrate excellent performance in both mixed and auto-thermal reforming of CH 4 , where satisfactory thermal stability was noted for the first 50 h. An interesting observation was that no significant carbon formation was obtained on surface of the investigated catalysts after the reforming reaction. Very recently, Koo et al.

        <p>Mesoporous SBA-15 has aroused enormous interest among researchers in steam reforming [165,166], and CH4 dry reforming [68,167], process due to its high surface area, high silanol group density, uniformity of pores and enhancement in active metal dispersion with smaller crystallite size [168]. A group of Nickel/SBA-15 catalysts with Ni content ranging from 5 to 15 wt % were synthesized by Huang et al. [169], along with 10% Ni/MgO/SBA-15 catalysts with MgO content ranging from 1 to 7 wt (wt %) during combined steam and dry reforming reaction in a continuous micro-reactor. XRD, H 2 -TPR and CO 2 -TPD techniques were used to investigate the structure of catalysts. The authors observed that selectivity of carbon monoxide (CO) for these reactions was almost 100% and they also noticed that with the change in the molar ratio of H 2 O/ CO 2 , there can be effective control of the H 2 /CO ratio. After reaction at 850 C for more than 120 h with 10 wt % of Ni/SBA-15 catalyst, the conversion of methane underwent a decrease from 98% to 85% while the conversion of CO 2 reduced from 86% to 53%, respectively. Additionally, the catalyst containing 3% MgO/SBA-15 loaded with Ni demonstrated excellent catalytic activity after a reaction for 620 h and the CO 2 conversion over this catalyst underwent a decrease from 92% to 77%, while no change in CH 4 conversion was observed. Furthermore, certain changes in the MgO promoter enhanced the Ni 0 species dispersion and resulted in an increase in the adsorption affinity of CO 2 , thereby inhibiting coke deposition and retarding the deactivation phenomenon.Mesoporous SBA-15 has aroused enormous interest among researchers in steam reforming [165,166], and CH4 dry reforming [68,167], process due to its high surface area, high silanol group density, uniformity of pores and enhancement in active metal dispersion with smaller crystallite size [168].

The conversion percentage of methane was consistent with the thermodynamically expected variants. The authors also noted that nickel catalyst loaded with SBA-15 demonstrated enhanced catalytic activity than Ni/celites, however both these catalysts underwent rapid deactivation on stream which was attributed to the partial re-oxidation of the Ni active phase under the investigated conditions (see Fig. 22).Jabbour et al.

The authors also noted that nickel catalyst loaded with SBA-15 demonstrated enhanced catalytic activity than Ni/celites, however both these catalysts underwent rapid deactivation on stream which was attributed to the partial re-oxidation of the Ni active phase under the investigated conditions (see Fig. 22).</p>
        <p>SBA-15 support has been employed for suppressing carbon formation in steam reforming reactions [166,167], and has aroused significant interest due to its high surface area, high silanol group density, pore uniformity. An incipient wetness method was employed by Singh et al. [176], to synthesise SBA-15Àpacked Ni catalyst by impregnating nickel nitrate onto the SBA-15 support. They found that the surface area decreased from 669.5 m 2 g À1 to 538.6 m 2 g À1 with the change in catalyst support from SBA-15 to 10 wt % Nickel/SBA-15 catalyst was confirmed by BET surface area analysis. Analysis by H 2 -TPR demonstrated the complete reduction of NiO nanoparticles beyond 576.85 C where the temperature of reduction from nickel oxide to metallic nickel was completely dependent on metal-support interactions which was correlated to the location, confinement effect and crystallite size of nickel oxide. CO 2 and H 2 O had a significant role in controlling formation of carbon during bi-reforming of methane due to their unique capability in converting the partially dehydrogenated C x H 1-x to a mixture of CO and H 2 . The authors observed that carbon dioxide conversion and methane conversion was 58.9%, and 61.6% respectively. Furthermore, the resulting H 2 /CO ratio was found to be 2.14 during the combined CO 2 and steam reforming of CH 4 under stoichiometric conditions. A steep increase in the H 2 and CO yield was noticed while increasing the CO 2 /(CH 4 þ H 2 O) ratio, and a considerable decrease in the ratio of both hydrogen and carbon monoxide ratio ranging from 2.14 to 1.83 was observed with a decrease in the H 2 O/ (CH 4 þ CO 2 ) ratio. Furthermore, Ni/SBA-15 exhibited higher resistance towards both coking and sintering which was related to the efficient distribution of nickel particles and steric effects caused by SBA-15.SBA-15 support has been employed for suppressing carbon formation in steam reforming reactions [166,167], and has aroused significant interest due to its high surface area, high silanol group density, pore uniformity.

        <p>The synthesis, catalytic activity and characterisation studies on Ni/SBA-15 catalysts during BRM has been reported [177]. The authors observed that 25 wt % Nickel/SBA-15 SGM catalyst showed the maximum conversion of CH 4 (23%, 548 C), which was followed Ni/SBA-15 HTM (CH 4 z 20% at 548 C) and 10% CH 4 conversion was achieved in presence of 25 wt % Ni/SBA-15 CG catalyst. CO 2 and CH 4 conversion were found to be 82% and 23% at 548 C, respectively. These differences in the catalytic activity were related to the degree of availability of active metal for the reaction. Due to excellent catalyst activity of these catalysts, these catalysts were employed for the formation of membrane reactor with hollow fibres and catalytic hollow fibres.The synthesis, catalytic activity and characterisation studies on Ni/SBA-15 catalysts during BRM has been reported [177].

        <p>Mesoporous siliceous SBA-15 material has been used as support for preparing active metal catalysts in several reforming processes [66,178]. The mesoporous SBA-15 support possessed uniform mesopores with thick framework walls, high thermal stability and wide specific surface area [179], [. Additionally, the ordered hexagonal mesostructure of SBA-15 support provided a confinement effect to anchor the nanoparticles inside its channels and also prevented deposition of carbonaceous species metal sintering [115]. Siang et al. [180], used the incipient wetness impregnation technique to synthesise stable and active boron (B) aided catalyst for bireforming of methane. Results revealed that B 2 O 3 and nickel oxide particles were scattered on the outer area of SBA-15 support possessing higher surface area. Additionally, the authors observed an enhancement in catalytic activity that underwent a linear increase with temperature due to the endothermic behaviour of the catalysed process. They obtained H 2 /CO molar ratio of 2.7 and 67.3% of CH 4 conversion at 799.8 C which was highly significant for downstream Fischer-Tropsch (FT) applications. Furthermore, XPS measurements revealed that B facilitated the adsorption of CO 2 through the electron transfer to the Ni cluster at the neighbourhood, thereby improving its catalytic activity. More importantly, analysis by XRD and Raman showed that boron doped catalyst was completely free from graphitic and amorphous carbon deposition. This was due to the incorporation of B into the octahedral sites occupied by NiO, resulting in inhibition of carbonaceous deposits.Mesoporous siliceous SBA-15 material has been used as support for preparing active metal catalysts in several reforming processes [66,178].

        <p>Encapsulation of Ni particles in a suitable support material has been reported [181] to enhance the sintering resistance and coke resistance of Ni catalysts. The introduction of promoters namely rare-earth metals; metal oxides, alkaline earth and alkali metals is also one of the effective strategy to prevent the sintering of active sites/supports and enhance the coke-resistant ability of catalysts [182]. Chen et al. [153], synthesized highly dispersed mNi/xLa-Si catalysts by employing one pot sol-gel process by varying the weight percentages of nickel and lanthanum. These catalysts were subsequently applied to generate syngas during bi-reforming of CH 4 . The authors observed that La addition enhanced the stability, coke resistance and catalytic activity of mNi/x LanthanumeSilicon catalysts. The 17.5Ni/3.0LaSi catalyst prepared by employing poly (ethylene glycol) and ethylene glycol displayed the coke resistance, maximum selectivity and catalytic activity. One notable observation was that a H 2 / CO ratio of about 2 was obtained when the carbon to sulphur ratio was maintained at 0.5, for the 17.5Ni/3.0LaSi catalyst, suitable for potential applications in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.Encapsulation of Ni particles in a suitable support material has been reported [181] to enhance the sintering resistance and coke resistance of Ni catalysts.

From their results it was noticed that a multicomponent Sn 0.02 Nickel/Cerium-Al catalyst showed excellent catalytic characteristic and remained active over a long period of 92 h. The catalyst also demonstrated an exceptional level of stability and conversion during BRM. Comparison of dry reforming and BRM reactions over the Sn0.02Ni/CeeAl catalyst at 700 C revealed that H 2 /CO ratio remained above 1.6 for 24 h.

        <p>Agli et al. [191], reported that basic mineralisers affect the nucleation, rearrangement and crystallisation of gel made of zirconia during the synthesis of zirconium oxide.

Results from their studies revealed that the catalysts performance depended on texture of the zirconium oxide support and its morphology was also highly affected by the mineraliser amount. In this study, the authors synthesized Zirconium oxide support with a mole ratio sodium acetate/Zr 4þ as 0.5 denoted by (SAc 0.5 ). ZrO 2 Àsupported Ni catalyst was synthesized by employing sodium acetate where the mole ratio was N SAc/Zr ¼ 0 and also showed increased catalytic activity in comparison to catalyst i.e zirconium oxide synthesized using (SC) where the ratio was N sc /Z r ¼ 0.5. The authors established from the results that sodium acetate would serve as a suitable mineraliser for making an excellent ZrO 2 support and also in terms of its stability and activity. Furthermore, the authors [190] observed that, in general, the addition of different amounts of mineralisers to ZrO 2 supports had a significant effect on textural properties, which in turn affected the behaviour of the Nisupported catalysts on zirconium oxide and also influenced the catalytic activity of the Nickel/Zirconium oxide catalysts during bi-reforming of methane.Agli et al.

        <p>The TEM micrographs in Fig. 24 show that all the investigated zirconium oxide supports resembled cobblestone like structure, with dimension of mesopores. Interestingly, reduction in pore volume and pore diameter along with expansion in the surface area was observed when the S Ac /Zr molar ratio rose from 0.5 to 2.0. This provided the Ni/ZrO 2 catalyst with a bigger crystallite size but also caused lower dispersion compared to Ni/ZrO 2 (SA c0.5 ). From these studies, the authors noted lowering in the sintering resistance of nickel in Ni/ZrO 2 (SAc 2.0 ) catalyst than Ni/ZrO 2 (SAc 0.5 ), which was attributed to its imperfect interaction between nickel and zirconium oxide as established by H 2 -Temperature programmed reduction.

        <p>Interestingly, after the removal of water the conversion of carbon dioxide and methane remained roughly constant, and at the same level as after interaction with water (Fig. 28a). A more drastic reduction in H 2 /CO from 0.82 to 0.45 was also noticed after 22 h. However, the authors observed that DRM of CH 4 in presence of H 2 O occurred differently with PteCeeZrO 2 PteZrO 2 catalysts. Furthermore, CH 4 and CO 2 conversion underwent a decrease upon addition of water during the ongoing reaction on the PteZrO 2 (Fig. 28 a) catalysts, with the decrease in conversion of CO 2 being significant. This was attributed to the reaction between excess H 2 and higher amount of CO 2 through water-gas shift reaction [209] in the reverse mode. The reduced stability observed in the PteZrO 2 catalyst was related to the diminishing of oxygen vacancies on the support and oxidation behaviour. Furthermore, Temperature Programed Oxidation analysis established that water addition enhanced the amount of mass of carbon deposited on the surface. Nevertheless, PteCeeZrO 2 exhibited excellent stability in presence of H 2 O and its stability was due to higher number of vacancies caused by O 2 on the support.

        <p>Danilova et al. [215], reported the synthesis of thick porous Ni ribbon (pNirb) with a MgO under layer supported by Ni catalyst on the top. The under layer constituting magnesium oxide was synthesized by packing of the support with MgNO 3 solution, then subjected to drying followed by calcination performed at 550 C in presence of air designated as Support 1 and the calcination performed in flowing H 2 was known as Support 2. The catalyst was reduced under the atmosphere of flowing H 2 at 750 C was termed catalyst I and the catalyst reduced at 900 C was termed catalyst II. Use of these supported catalysts resulted in 49% and 56% conversion of CH 4 with support 1 and support 2, respectively. The greater activity of support 2 in comparison to support 1 was attributed to efficient dispersion of Ni crystallites that was produced from solid solution reduced in presence of reaction medium. The authors further remarked that catalyst II (2.7% Ni/(p Nirb þ8.6% MgO) and 4.0% Ni/(pNirb þ10.4% MgO) exhibited excellent stability for CH 4 conversion over a period of 18 h compared with catalyst I (4.6% Ni/(pNirb þ6.0% MgO) and 4.6% Ni/ (pNirb þ 6.0% MgO) under the following conditions: GHSV ¼ 62.5 L h À1 ,CH 4 /CO 2 /H 2 /N 2 ¼ 35/23/39/3).Danilova et al.

        <p>The authors noted that an increase in temperature during the bi-reforming (BRM) of methane increased the CH 4 conversion, however decreased conversion of CO 2 (Fig. 31). Furthermore, Fig. 30 shows that 3% Ruthenium/ZincLaAlO 4 demonstrated the lowest activity while 10%Ni/g-Al 2 O 3 showed marked activity for CO 2 conversion.

        <p>The Sr-doped NieLa 2 O 3 catalyst has been reported [222] to generate the highest CH 4 and CO 2 activity along with the highest resistance to carbon deposition over the catalyst surface which was attributed to considerable involvement of a large amount of mobile lattice oxygen species as a result of CeH activation in dry reforming. Yang et al. [223], have reported the role of Sr addition to LaNiO 3 perovskite catalysts during the bireforming process. Mineralogical characterisation by XRD revealed a distortion in the perovskite lattice and generation of alien phases such as La 2 ÀxSr x NiO 3 ± d and Sr 0.5 La 1.5 NiO 4 . The authors [223] observed that the reduction behaviour was affected by the presence of these phases. The results also revealed that strontium oxide adsorbed CO 2 during the bi-reforming reaction and formed strontium carbonate (SrCO 3 ), which possessed the unique ability of inhibiting carbon sources by producing La 2 O 2 CO 3 . The addition of Sr particles covered the support sites thereby resulting in large-sized Ni particles by decreasing the interlinkage between the support and active metals. The authors [223] recommended using a small amount of Sr in the perovskite-based catalyst for obtaining greater resistance to carbon deposition. Furthermore, larger Ni particles were formed, with diameters of 30.8, 29.9, 27.6 nm for concentrations of 10%, 50%, 30% SrO containing La of carbon dioxide at a certain concentration of Al 2 O 3 used as a modifier. The authors found that though all the investigated tested catalysts provided close activation energies values, the increase in dispersion of aluminium oxide on silicon carbide with 10 wt % Al 2 O 3 as modifier was in agreement with the higher distribution of perovskite containing La 2 NiO 4 crystallites. Additionally, larger amounts of adsorption of carbon dioxide on the efficiently distributed basic Sr and La oxides were also responsible for enhanced carbon dioxide conversion. CO 2 and CH 4 conversion also correlated well to the IA1/ INi ratios obtained from XPS analyses.The Sr-doped NieLa 2 O 3 catalyst has been reported [222] to generate the highest CH 4 and CO 2 activity along with the highest resistance to carbon deposition over the catalyst surface which was attributed to considerable involvement of a large amount of mobile lattice oxygen species as a result of CeH activation in dry reforming.

Most importantly, the catalytic activity changed from very high (50% conversion) to very low (10% conversion) within a time interval of 10 min. Additionally, for various inlet feed compositions similar performance was exhibited by the catalyst.

Ni catalysts supported by smaller nanoparticles of CeeZrO 2 ZrO 2 , MgO were observed to be extremely stable and active for BRM processes. The degree of coke formation was dependent on each investigated catalyst.

        <p>Bi-reforming of methane over a catalytic nickel membrane for the GTL (gas to liquid) process produced a very high conversion of methane in the range of 92.7e96% above 973 K, when the CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratios were in the range of 0e1.0. GTL process possessed two advantages. One was that carbon formation was reduced due to the oxidation of carbon precursor species and a desirable H 2 /CO was achieved by adjusting CH 4 /H 2 O/CO 2 ratio in the feed stream. Cerium containing Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 catalysts synthesized by both co -precipitation and impregnation technique exhibited higher metal dispersion than Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 alone and showed marked reducibility at lower temperatures around temperature 550 C as confirmed by XPS since the redox properties of Ce 4þ / Ce 3þ resulted in easier gasification of the settled coke on the surface of the catalyst and also helped in storage and delivering of active oxygen thereby enhancing the dispersion of Ni. The catalyst Ni/g-Al 2 O 3 promoted very higher conversion of carbon dioxide (82.4%) and methane (98.3%) when subjected to bi-reforming of methane for 200 h since the Ni/ Al 2 O 3 catalyst exhibited characteristics such as high metal dispersion, high catalytic activity large specific surface area, and stronger metal support interaction respectively. Presence of MgO in 20 wt % MgO/Ni catalyst was quite effective in preventing coke formation due to the formation stable MgAl 2 O 4 spinel phase at higher temperatures. The presence of CeO 2 in Ce 1-x eZr x O 2 catalytic systems caused a marked improvement in redox properties, thermal stability, and promotion of metal dispersion and also enhanced the oxygen storage ability of CeO 2 . A drastic reduction in carbon deposition from 25.96% to 1.08% was observed for a feed composition of CH 4 : CO 2 : H 2 O ¼ 1.0:0.55:0.55 when CO 2 reforming was performed in conjunction with steam reforming process in presence of NiOeCaO catalyst due to its high selectivity, activity and productivity in the oxidative conversion of methane to synthesis gas. Nickel/Santa Barabara Amorphous À15 (SBA-15) exhibited enormous resistance both towards sintering and coking. 10% Nickel/3% MgO/Santa Barabara Amorphous 15 catalyst demonstrated higher catalytic performance after reaction for 620 h since the mesoporous SBA-15 support possessed uniform mesopores with thick framework walls, high thermal stability and wide specific surface area. Bimetallic systems such as Sn 0.02 Nickel/Cerium-Al catalyst displayed superior catalytic activity, increased the resistance of carbon formation and remained active over a long period of 92 h in comparison to their own counterparts. The remarkable level of stability and excellent conversions seen in the bi-reforming process has proved the versatility of Sn0.02Ni/CeeAl catalyst which could be upgraded to variety of CO 2 containing feed stocks. Ni-based catalysts supported on mesoporous MgOeAl 2 O 3 resembling a MgeAl hydrotalcite structure with Mg/Al ratio of 1 demonstrated excellent conversion efficiencies for CH 4 (93.7%) and CO 2 (75.2%) and higher resistance to coke formation due to its basic property, enhanced steam as well as CO 2 adsorption, strong Ni to support interaction of these catalysts. The excellent catalytic performance of Ni 30 wt % SiO 2 55 wt % MgO catalyst was ascribed to its acidic strength, enhanced basicity and structural stability under high temperatures. NdCOO 3 perovskite-type mixed-oxide catalysts proved to be highly efficient for carbon-free bi-reforming process. PteCeeZrO 2 catalyst exhibited excellent stability in presence of H 2 O and its stability was attributed to the greater number of O 2 vacancies present in the support. Lanthanum promoted catalysts exhibited greater nickel dispersion than Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 catalyst due to their enhanced interactions between the metal and support. Nie2.5La/MgAl 2 O 4 catalyst showed maximum sinter stability and activity due to its enhanced nickel dispersion and surface area.Bi-reforming of methane over a catalytic nickel membrane for the GTL (gas to liquid) process produced a very high conversion of methane in the range of 92.7e96% above 973 K, when the CO 2 /H 2 O feed ratios were in the range of 0e1.0.

The presence of CeO 2 in Ce 1-x eZr x O 2 catalytic systems caused a marked improvement in redox properties, thermal stability, and promotion of metal dispersion and also enhanced the oxygen storage ability of CeO 2 . A drastic reduction in carbon deposition from 25.96% to 1.08% was observed for a feed composition of CH 4 : CO 2 : H 2 O ¼ 1.0:0.55:0.55 when CO 2 reforming was performed in conjunction with steam reforming process in presence of NiOeCaO catalyst due to its high selectivity, activity and productivity in the oxidative conversion of methane to synthesis gas. Nickel/Santa Barabara Amorphous À15 (SBA-15) exhibited enormous resistance both towards sintering and coking. 10% Nickel/3% MgO/Santa Barabara Amorphous 15 catalyst demonstrated higher catalytic performance after reaction for 620 h since the mesoporous SBA-15 support possessed uniform mesopores with thick framework walls, high thermal stability and wide specific surface area. Bimetallic systems such as Sn 0.02 Nickel/Cerium-Al catalyst displayed superior catalytic activity, increased the resistance of carbon formation and remained active over a long period of 92 h in comparison to their own counterparts. The remarkable level of stability and excellent conversions seen in the bi-reforming process has proved the versatility of Sn0.02Ni/CeeAl catalyst which could be upgraded to variety of CO 2 containing feed stocks. Ni-based catalysts supported on mesoporous MgOeAl 2 O 3 resembling a MgeAl hydrotalcite structure with Mg/Al ratio of 1 demonstrated excellent conversion efficiencies for CH 4 (93.7%) and CO 2 (75.2%) and higher resistance to coke formation due to its basic property, enhanced steam as well as CO 2 adsorption, strong Ni to support interaction of these catalysts. The excellent catalytic performance of Ni 30 wt % SiO 2 55 wt % MgO catalyst was ascribed to its acidic strength, enhanced basicity and structural stability under high temperatures. NdCOO 3 perovskite-type mixed-oxide catalysts proved to be highly efficient for carbon-free bi-reforming process. PteCeeZrO 2 catalyst exhibited excellent stability in presence of H 2 O and its stability was attributed to the greater number of O 2 vacancies present in the support. Lanthanum promoted catalysts exhibited greater nickel dispersion than Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 catalyst due to their enhanced interactions between the metal and support. Nie2.5La/MgAl 2 O 4 catalyst showed maximum sinter stability and activity due to its enhanced nickel dispersion and surface area.</p>
        <p>It is highly essential to develop Ni-based catalysts containing bi-metallic and tri-metallic configuration since Ni displayed stronger stability and enhanced activity. However, the biggest constraint in this approach is the coke formation. Bi-reforming process is endothermic and would require higher activation energy to achieve the synthesis. Future studies should be undertaken to design an appropriate bimetallic and tri-metallic catalyst that can be suitable at lower temperatures. Furthermore, the approach towards catalyst formation has a significant influence on the catalyst's capability. Therefore, selecting a suitable catalyst and its synthesis technique can provide improved SMSI, superior activity, enhanced Ni dispersion on the catalytic support and stability against coke formation.It is highly essential to develop Ni-based catalysts containing bi-metallic and tri-metallic configuration since Ni displayed stronger stability and enhanced activity.

        <p>Among the evaluated inlet feed compositions, conducting bi-reforming process under a stoichiometric feed composition (CH 4: CO 2: H 2 O ¼ 3:1:2) is considered the ideal one for selective production of syngas within the operating temperature of 750e800 C range. One of the major drawback associated with nano-based catalysts is that the up scaling of catalyst preparation from laboratory batches to continuous industrial production. Henceforth, development of reproducible and economical synthetic strategies is imperative for linking all advantages of nano-based catalysts to large-scale metgas generation facilities.Among the evaluated inlet feed compositions, conducting bi-reforming process under a stoichiometric feed composition (CH 4: CO 2: H 2 O ¼ 3:1:2) is considered the ideal one for selective production of syngas within the operating temperature of 750e800 C range.
