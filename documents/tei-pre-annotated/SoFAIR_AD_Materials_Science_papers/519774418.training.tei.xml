        <p>The most pressing challenges in the field of light-driven hydrogel actuators include reliance on UV light, slow response, poor mechanical properties and limited functionalities. Herein, we introduce a supramolecular design strategy to address these issues. Key to our design strategy is the use of a benzyl imine-functionalized anthracene group which red shifts the absorption into the visible region and also stabilizes the supramolecular network through π-π interactions. Another key design is to incorporate acid-ether hydrogen bonds for energy dissipation under mechanical deformation and maintaining hydrophilicity of the network. This double crosslinked supramolecular hydrogel developed via a simple synthesis route exhibits a unique combination of high strength, rapid self-healing and fast visible light-driven shape morphing both in the wet and dry state. Furthermore, as all interactions we have engineered are dynamic, our design enables the structures to be recycled and reprogrammed into different 3D objects.The most pressing challenges in the field of light-driven hydrogel actuators include reliance on UV light, slow response, poor mechanical properties and limited functionalities.

        <p>Light permits remote, precise manipulation with spatial and temporal control. [2] By tuning various irradiation parameters such as light intensity, exposure time and wavelength, the degree of light-induced bending deformations can be wellcontrolled. [2a, 3] Furthermore, well-defined and complex three-dimensional (3D) structures can be generated through patterned light irradiation [2d, 4] or modulating polarization direction. [5] Light-driven actuation enables practical applications in diverse fields such as soft robots, [1f, 6] microfluidics, [7] biomedical [8] and optical devices, [9] energy harvesting [10] and manipulation of fluid slugs. [11] Photoresponsive soft actuators are primarily based on liquid crystal elastomers, [2g, 5a, 11-12] hydrogels, [2a, 2b, 13] shape memory polymers, [14] crystalline [15] and carbon-based soft materials.

        <p>Most systems use high intensity short-wavelength UV light. [2h] Moreover, the photoresponsive hydrogels typically suffer from poor mechanical properties, namely fatigue-related failure. The hydrogel properties are unable to be recovered or repaired after being damaged. Most designs have permanent crosslinkers hence rendering the hydrogels impossible to be reprocessed or recycled. There is a need for new soft actuators triggered by long-wavelength visible light, which possess diverse functionalities including high mechanical strength, self-healing and recyclability.Most systems use high intensity short-wavelength UV light.

        <p>Dynamic, shape changing materials are critical to enable function, particularly in a biological context; from muscle contractions to the programmed movement of small molecule functionalized with a benzyl imine group at the 9-position could induce a red shift in the absorption and also enhance the photochemical reactivity. The photo-responsive hydrogel was fabricated by covalently incorporating this anthracene small molecule into a soft, flexible and highly hydrophilic copolymer containing acidether hydrogen bonding. The anthracene group was demonstrated to enable the formation of a stable supramolecular network in aqueous solution, significantly enhancing the mechanical properties of hydrogel due to π-π interaction as a crosslinking point. Moreover, the fast visible light-initiated photo-dimerization of anthracene results in a change in the network properties and thus initiates rapid actuation both in wet and dry state. Our photoresponsive hydrogel is observed to manifest all the targeted attributes, namely, high mechanical strength, rapid selfhealing, self-recovery, fast visible light driven actuation and recyclability. This new molecular design strategy offers the potential to address the limits of the current generation of light-responsive shape changing hydrogels.Dynamic, shape changing materials are critical to enable function, particularly in a biological context; from muscle contractions to the programmed movement of small molecule functionalized with a benzyl imine group at the 9-position could induce a red shift in the absorption and also enhance the photochemical reactivity.

        <p>Anthracene, consisting of three fused benzene rings came to our attention. [26] It undergoes efficient and reversible photodimerization upon light irradiation, which is expected to tune the swelling ratio of network. [27] The absorption maxima could be red shifted by placing an electron rich group at the 9-position of the anthracene ring. [28] Inspired by these examples, we selected anthracene to impart photoresponsiveness into the hydrogel network. The electron rich imine bond was introduced to functionalize the anthracene ring (Figure 1A) as it could be readily formed through scalable and simple Schiff base chemistry (Scheme S1). The synthesis of anthracene small organic molecule was readily achieved by a one-step reaction between commercially available anthracene-9-carbaldehyde and 4-aminophenol. The presence of benzyl substituent on the imine bond was used to enhance the photosensitivity of anthracene under visible light irradiation for promoting a fast actuation response. [28a] The high purity of the synthesized benzyl imine-functionalized anthracene (BIFA) was confirmed by NMR (Figure S1). The X-ray single crystal structure of BIFA shows intermolecular face-face π-π stacking interactions between anthracenyl units of 3.43 and 3.58 Å (Figure S2). UV-Vis spectra of BIFA shows a strong absorption in the visible light region between 400 nm and 470 nm (Figure S3), which is in contrast with other reported anthracene molecules that only absorbs strongly in UV light region. [27,29] A key feature of our molecular design is the presence of hydroxyl group in the BIFA, which could be further utilized to covalently attach to polymer chains. We selected poly(methacrylic acid-co-oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate) (poly(MAA-co-OEGMA) synthesized by one-pot reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT)) polymerization as the polymer matrix. Characterization via NMR indicates a final composition of poly(MAA140-co-OEGMA99) and Mn= 51,000 g mol -1 . This was chosen due to highly dynamic nature of acid-ether hydrogen bonding, [30] the strong solvation effect of OEGMA; [21,31] and the COOH functional group enables further post-polymerization functionalization. The desired H-bonding interactions in poly(MAA-co-OEGMA) were evaluated using FTIR. The carbonyl (C=O) stretchings at 1725 cm -1 and 1700 cm -1 were observed (Figure S4), which could be ascribed to self-associated COOH dimer and intermolecular hydrogen bond between MAA and OEGMA, respectively. [30] The stronger signal intensity observed at 1725 cm -1 compared to that at 1700 cm -1 may suggest that most of the MAA units have formed intermolecular hydrogen bond acid-ether hydrogen bonds with OEGMA. The poly(MAA-co-OEGMA) was functionalized with BIFA through simple esterification.Anthracene, consisting of three fused benzene rings came to our attention.

        <p>NMR indicated the successful incorporation of BIFA as confirmed by the presence of broad characteristic peaks of anthracene rings ranging from 6.8 to 9.8 ppm (Figure S5). The conversion of COOH group into aromatic ester was calculated to be 28% hence a composition of poly(MAA140-co-BIFA39-co-OEGMA60). π-π stacking in the functionalized copolymer was confirmed by the red-shifted absorbance compared to that of BIFA small molecule (Figure S6).NMR indicated the successful incorporation of BIFA as confirmed by the presence of broad characteristic peaks of anthracene rings ranging from 6.8 to 9.8 ppm (Figure S5).

        <p>In order to understand the role of anthracene functionality on physicochemical properties of the network, first, the stability of poly(MAA-co-OEGMA) and BIFA functionalized poly(MAA-co-OEGMA) in water were investigated. As shown in Figure S7, the poly(MAA-co-OEGMA) was observed to be dissolved after being immersed in water for 24h, which could be explained as highly water solubility of the OEGMA unit. In contrast, BIFA functionalized poly(MAA-co-OEGMA) soaked in water was insoluble but only swollen and lead to an eventual equilibrium degree (Figure 1B,C). Such substantial difference could be ascribed to the strong π-π interaction in the anthracene copolymer as additional supramolecular crosslinking sites as well as enhanced intermolecular hydrogen bonds by the increased hydrophobic environment. [32] The observed broad -O-H stretching vibrations from 3300-3600 cm -1 and the new strong peak at 1640 cm -1 in FTIR demonstrate (Figure S8) stretching vibrations of hydrogen bond between ester carbonyl groups and water.In order to understand the role of anthracene functionality on physicochemical properties of the network, first, the stability of poly(MAA-co-OEGMA) and BIFA functionalized poly(MAA-co-OEGMA) in water were investigated.

        <p>It is worth to note that the peak at 1725 cm -1 ascribed to the intermolecular hydrogen bond between MAA and OEGMA could still be detected even in the wet state, indicating the presence of acid-ether hydrogen bonds stabilized by hydrophobic methyl motif and anthracene group. The equilibrium water content was measured to be as high as 213 ± 7% despite relatively high content of hydrophobic anthracene group, which could be interpreted as a result of solvation effect offered by the relatively long oligo(ethylene glycol) side chain. [21,31] This result illustrates that the incorporation of anthracene group could facilitate the formation of stable supramolecular hydrogel network in water, without the need to use covalent crosslinkers which have been commonly employed in fabricating other photoresponsive hydrogels. [13, 18b] To simplify discussion, the BIFA functionalized poly(MAA-co-OEGMA) will be referred to as π-π hydrogel.It is worth to note that the peak at 1725 cm -1 ascribed to the intermolecular hydrogen bond between MAA and OEGMA could still be detected even in the wet state, indicating the presence of acid-ether hydrogen bonds stabilized by hydrophobic methyl motif and anthracene group.

        <p>The π-π hydrogel was further analyzed via dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA). The temperature sweep showed an increase of 9 orders of magnitude in the storage modulus for the π-π hydrogel compared to that of poly(MAA-co-OEGMA) at 25 ºC (Figure 1D). The lower tan δ of the π-π hydrogel is indicative of an increased elastic character [33] as a result of anthracene incorporation. The frequency sweep at room temperature revealed that the storage modulus (G') of poly(MAA-co-OEGMA) is consistently lower than that of loss modulus (G'') over the frequency range (Figure S9A), implying that the polymer is in liquid state. However, the π-π hydrogel showed a crossover where G' =G'' at frequency of 12 rad/s (Figure S9B) and G' was greater than G" at higher frequencies, indicating more solid like properties. These results confirm that the anthracene group plays an important role in stabilizing hydrogel network through forming additional π-π crosslinking. [34] Mechanical and self-healing properties: One of the key challenges that restricts widespread use of hydrogel actuators in many applications is their poor mechanical properties. The material design concept in this work could allow high mechanical strength and toughness, this is enabled by the π-π and hydrogen bonding crosslinked networks. The weak acid-ether hydrogen bonding could efficiently dissipate energy by bond scission, while the stronger π-π interactions can withstand mechanical forces to maintain the integrality of network. [35] The robust mechanical properties of the hydrogel (4×1×0.08 cm) was demonstrated as the ability to withstand 3000× its own weight (Figure 2A). The hydrogel could also be bent and twisted into helical shape without failure (Figure 2A). The anthracene incorporation in the polymer networks brings about a 11-fold increase in Young's modulus and a 20-fold increase in tensile strength from 0.18 ± 0.02 to 3.67 ± 0.02 MPa. This change also comes with a decrease in the stretching ratio because of reinforced interchain interaction and rigidity (Figure 2B). The π-π hydrogel displayed remarkable physical properties for a non-covalent material, including high fracture stress (3.7 ± 0.4% MPa) and Young's modulus ( 10MPa), toughness (6.6 ± 0.1% MJ m -3 ) and fracture strain (353 ± 4%). The Young's modulus of this hydrogel is hundreds of times higher than other reported photochemically shape changing hydrogels (Young's modulus ≈ 8.5 kPa to 45 kPa). [18b, 18c, 19-20, 23a] While in contrast, the poly(MAA-co-OEGMA) lacking π-π interaction was observed to be a soft, tacky film measured with ≈0.1 MPa tensile stress and low Young's modulus of 0.9 MPa and could not be fractured even after stretching over 8000% of its original size (Figure 2B). Furthermore, stress-relaxation measurements showed remarkable longer relaxation time τ and only 18% of released stress in supramolecular hydrogel (Figure S10). The resisted complete stress relaxation could originate from the strong and dense π-π stacking as efficient crosslinking sites. These results demonstrate the importance of π-π interaction from anthracene, which has considerably higher dissociation energies and much slower relaxation time than hydrogen bonds, [35a] in strengthening the networks and increasing the intermolecular interaction. We also performed loading-unloading test of π-π hydrogel at a maximal strain of 100% (Figure S11). The observed large prominent hysteresis loops for strains beyond the linear regime indicates efficient energy dissipation which could be ascribed to the rupture of sacrificial hydrogen bonding.The π-π hydrogel was further analyzed via dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA).

        <p>The hysteresis loop recovered to its original value after a waiting time of 20 min. This result indicates the fast and efficient self-recovery properties of our hydrogel, which could be as a result of fast reassociation of the broken hydrogen bonding and elasticity provided by π-π interaction of the anthracene group. [35a] Self-healing can also be engineered into this system as the material consists of noncovalent interactions which are generally under continuous equilibrium. [36] We assessed the self-healing properties of the hydrogel by attaching two hydrogel slabs with different colors at 35ºC. The hydrogel was in elastomeric state at 35ºC which could promote the dissociation and reform of π-π interaction and hydrogen bonding (Figure 1D and1E). After only 1 min, the hydrogel interface became so tightly attached that it still maintained integrity after further stretch up to elongation of 100% (Figure 2C). We then designed experiments to isolate each dynamic bond independently to establish if both are responsible for self-healing. To isolate the π-π bonds, two cut edges were dipped in t-butanol which could break the acid-ether hydrogen bonding, [37] brought in contact, and heated at 35 °C for 3 min (Figure S12A). The cut surfaces of the two separate pieces were tightly merged, which could be ascribed to the π-π bond reforming. To isolate the hydrogen bonding, the selfhealing property was studied in THF, which breaks the π-π bond in anthracene. [38] Following the same procedure it can be seen that the two separate pieces could still be fused together within 3 min (Figure S12B), which could be attributed to the highly dynamic acid-ether hydrogen bonding.

        <p>Tensile testing was then conducted to quantitatively study self-healing properties. It was shown that the π-π-hydrogel exhibited a rapid self-healing at 35ºC, and 68% recover of the original fracture stress was observed after only 3 min and almost overlapped with original curve after only 8 min (Figure 2D). As self-healing is related to polymer chain relaxation dynamics, the frequency sweep of hydrogel at 35ºC was tested. As shown in Figure S13, the relaxation time of hydrogel was calculated to be 0.007s, using the reciprocal of the crossover angular frequency. This calculated chain relaxation time is comparable to that of other ultra-fast self-healing polymers. [30,39] These results indicate that the excellent self-healing could be ascribed to fast chain mobility and dynamic exchange of noncovalent bonds in the π-π hydrogel.Tensile testing was then conducted to quantitatively study self-healing properties.

[30,39] These results indicate that the excellent self-healing could be ascribed to fast chain mobility and dynamic exchange of noncovalent bonds in the π-π hydrogel.</p>
        <p>Photoresponsive Shape Changing Behavior: Besides enhancing mechanical properties through π-π crosslinking, the anthracene group could undergo the photocrosslinking reaction. We anticipated this to change the microscopic network swelling degree and induce a macroscopic shape change. The photochemical process of π-π hydrogel was followed by UV-Vis spectra (Figure 3A). It was observed that irradiation of the hydrogel thin film with visible light (420-530 nm, 10 mW cm -1 ) resulted in rapid reduction of the absorption peak from 400 nm and 470 nm, indicating the dimerization of anthracene. Assuming first order reaction kinetics, the dimerization rate constants for hydrogel was calculated to be 1.6 × 10 -3 s -1 , which is comparable to that of the aromatic triazole ring substituted anthracene that was used for fast gelation process. [28a] This result reveals that our π-π hydrogel not only shows visible light responsiveness, but also fast photochemical kinetics. Furthermore, the FTIR spectral of exposed hydrogel showed the appearance of new peak at 765 cm -1 which could be ascribed to the anthracene dimer signal (Figure S14). [29c] Moreover, the loss of signal at 1625 cm -1 corresponding to the imine bond may suggest the occurring of [4 + 2] Diels-Alder photocycloaddition. [26a, 40] We then investigated the changes in the properties of hydrogels under visible light irradiation. The equilibrium water content of irradiated hydrogel is lower than that of its original one (Figure S15), suggesting the reduced hydration of the network. The visible light irradiation was also shown to result in a significant increase in tensile strengths and Young's moduli (Figure S16), reflecting the crosslinking of the hydrogel network due to photodimerization of anthracene. Further heating the exposed hydrogel at 90 ºC for 0.5 h almost restored the tensile curve of the hydrogel back to the unexposed state, which could be ascribed to the thermally induced reversibility of the of anthracene photodimerization, confirmed by FTIR results (Figure S14).Photoresponsive Shape Changing Behavior: Besides enhancing mechanical properties through π-π crosslinking, the anthracene group could undergo the photocrosslinking reaction.

        <p>The absorption coefficient of this newly designed anthracene group is as large as ≈1.65× 10 4 (Figure S3), suggesting that the top layer with a thickness of 2 μm absorbs 99% of the incident visible light and generate a structural gradient across the hydrogel thickness. [3c, 12d] To verify this, exposed π-π hydrogel was then studied by various methods, including UV-Vis spectroscopy, FTIR and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The transmittance of hydrogel film (20 µm thickness) was studied by UV-Vis spectroscopy (Figure S17). It was found that the light transmittance from 350 nm to 500 nm is only 12%. Moreover, structural characterization of the top and bottom surface indicated different chemical compositions (Figure S18), the anthracene dimer signal was not observed in the unexposed bottom side. SEM results showed that the cross-section consists of a rough and heterogeneous surface structure caused by lower crosslinking density. In regions of higher crosslink density a smoother more uniform surface structure was observed (Figure S19). [41] These results confirm the formation of a gradient across the hydrogel with more photodimerization at the top surface and very little dimerization at the bottom surface.The absorption coefficient of this newly designed anthracene group is as large as ≈1.65× 10 4 (Figure S3), suggesting that the top layer with a thickness of 2 μm absorbs 99% of the incident visible light and generate a structural gradient across the hydrogel thickness.

        <p>The light-programmed gradient in crosslinking density could translate into macroscopic 3D bending motion. As shown in Figure S20, the swollen hydrogel (3× 0.7× 0.1 cm) bent toward the light source side in water, reaching a bending angle of 12º after irradiation of 1h. Similar phenomenon has been observed in other photoswitchable hydrogels. [13a, 18b] The exposed surface of the hydrogel preferentially absorbs the light energy and has a much lower swelling ratio compared to the regions away from the light sources. Furthermore, the excellent mechanical properties of our materials enabled fabrication of thinner films (thickness ≈ 80 µm) without breakage, which exhibited much faster response speed with bending angle of 15 º after only 10 mins (Figure 3C). This could be interpreted as a result of a faster water diffusion process in thinner hydrogel film. [42] We then investigated the photo-induced actuation behavior in a dry double crosslinked polymer without water uptake. Taking advantage of high stretchability, initially, the gel was uniaxially elongated to a strain of 157% without being fractured. When this force was removed, the gel would slowly recover to this original length within 20 min due to excellent elasticity imparted by π-π crosslinking (Figure S21). Interestingly, irradiating the prestretched gel generated rapid bending toward the light source (Movie 1) with a bending angle of 28º within 20 s (Figure 3D). And bending angle increased with the increase irradiation time and finally reached a stable bending state (Figure S22A). There results indicate that our polymeric actuators could be working in different environments. The photo-induced bending movement in dry gel comes from the enhanced elastic recovery process [43] in the irradiated side due to slightly increased chemical crosslinking density upon light irradiation. The bent film reverted to the initial flat state within 60 min when heated to 90 °C (Figure S22C) the associated cleavage of the anthracene-dimers was confirmed by UV-Vis (Figure S22B) and FTIR spectral results (Figure S14). The reversible shape transformation could be cycled at least 5 times without obvious change in performance (Figure S22D). Furthermore, combining the excellent self-healing properties enables the fabrication of a variety of complex 3D morphologies simply through conjoining the actuated gel slabs. As shown in Figure 3E, when the two deformed hydrogel with bending angle of 21º were assembled by joining the edges, the Chinese character "人"was created.The light-programmed gradient in crosslinking density could translate into macroscopic 3D bending motion.

        <p>The 3D shape mimicking a flying bird could be afforded through assembling the two actuated gel slabs with larger bending angle of 38º in a similar manner. In addition, we obtained a cucumber tendril like shape through combining 4 actuated hydrogels with bending angle of 31º at both ends. The hydrogel can be further re-processed by dissolving in DMF at 90 ºC.The 3D shape mimicking a flying bird could be afforded through assembling the two actuated gel slabs with larger bending angle of 38º in a similar manner.

        <p>Light responsive shape changing hydrogels were usually constructed with covalent crosslinkers. [2a, 13a, 18b, 18c, 20] Once the 3D shape deformations of the photoresponsive hydrogel have been generated, these cannot be recycled. Our molecular design concept for constructing light-responsive hydrogel actuators is based on multiple dynamic chemistries and thus enables new possibilities in recycling. To demonstrate this, a helical structure was produced through selectively exposing a dry hydrogel sheet with a stripe angle of 45º followed by immersing in water (Figure 4A and4B).Light responsive shape changing hydrogels were usually constructed with covalent crosslinkers.

        <p>This actuated hydrogel was able to be dissolved in DMF which is a good solvent for both anthracene and poly(MAA-co-OEGMA) while being heated at temperature of 90 ºC (Figure 4C) because the anthracene dimerization is thermally reversable (Figure S14). In contrast, the actuated hydrogel could not be dissolved by directly mixed with DMF without heating treatment (Figure S23). The dissolved polymer solution was further remoulded into a cross geometry through solution casting (Figure 4D). The shape mimicking flower bloom could be achieved by uniformly light irradiation followed by immersing in water (Figure 4E).

        <p>In summary, we have succeeded in developing a new class of photoresponsive shape changing hydrogels through rational design of multiple dynamic chemistries. In order to achieve a supramolecular double network hydrogel, a red-shifted anthracene derivative was covalently incorporated into an engineered copolymer of poly(MAAco-OEGMA). The introduction of anthracene performs multiple tasks, it effectively promotes the formation of stable supramolecular network in water, significantly reinforcing the mechanical strength due to strong π-π interactions. The red shifted anthracene also enables the system to undergo fast photodimerization process upon visible light irradiation. Our supramolecular polymer design strategy facilitates the integration of a number of superior material properties synergistically in a single light-responsive shape changing hydrogel. We demonstrate visible-light-driven and fast deformation both in wet and dry states, high mechanical strength, self-healing, self-recovery as well as the capability of being recyclable and reprogrammable. We would like to highlight the simple molecular structure and ease of synthesis of this system. This innovative molecular design concept has addressed the most critical limitations in traditional light-driven hydrogel actuators and is expected to promote practical applications of this type of materials in various fields. Importantly, this work not only is a significant step forward to develop a novel light-controllable hydrogel but also represents a new strategy on the technological applications of photoresponsive anthracene in smart hydrogel devices.In summary, we have succeeded in developing a new class of photoresponsive shape changing hydrogels through rational design of multiple dynamic chemistries.
