        <p>Phase change materials provide desirable characteristics for latent heat thermal energy storage by keeping the high energy density and quasi isothermal working temperature. Along with this, the most promising phase change materials, including organics and inorganic salt hydrate, have low thermal conductivity as one of the main drawbacks. Metallic materials are attractive alternatives due to their higher thermal conductivity and high volumetric heat storage capacity. This paper presents an extensive review of the thermophysical properties of metals and alloys as the potential phase change materials for low (&lt; 40C), medium (40C -300C), and high ( &gt; 300C) temperatures. The information presented includes the fundamental thermophysical properties as melting temperature, the heat of fusion, density, specific heat, and thermal conductivity found in the published literature. The temperature dependence of critical properties as specific heat, density, thermal conductivity, expansion coefficient, viscosity is also reviewed, including mathematical theoretical predictions crucial from an engineering design point of view. Besides, the current work briefly summarises the potential applications and main challenges of metals and alloys as phase change materials. It is intended that this review provides a database of metallic phase change materials thermophysical properties to facilitate the selection, evaluation, and potential impact in different fields as solar energy storage, heating and cooling, electronic, bioengineering, and beyond. Highlights • Supercooling and corrosion are the main challenges for low-temperature MPCMs • Most medium-temperature MPCMs are non-compliant with RoHS directives • Encapsulation and compatibility are key research topics for LHTES applications • Simplified design and volume reduction could compensate the MPCMs weight penalties • Miscibility gap binary alloy, solid-solid and composite are innovative LHTES systemPhase change materials provide desirable characteristics for latent heat thermal energy storage by keeping the high energy density and quasi isothermal working temperature.

        <p>Phase change materials (PCMs) provide a useful mode of storing thermal energy as latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) due to their high thermal storage density at approximately isothermal conditions. Maria Telkes was pioneered in the study of phase change materials (PCM) for thermal energy storage in the 1940s. However, the interest in this technology appeared during the developing energy crisis of the early 1970s when latent heat storage research and development became a significant part of the solar energy programs [1][2][3][4][5][6]. In the last years, the interest in PCM has resurfaced considerably, mainly motivated for the deployment of LHTES to bridge the gap between supply and demand in solar energy [7][8][9]. Recently, the studied range of potential applications for PCM [10,11] is more extensive, including thermal management in electronic devices and batteries [12][13][14]; thermal comfort in buildings [15,16]; domestic space heating, hot water and cooking [17][18][19]; PV cooling and PV/Thermal [8,20], vehicle applications [21][22][23].Phase change materials (PCMs) provide a useful mode of storing thermal energy as latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) due to their high thermal storage density at approximately isothermal conditions.

        <p>At present, many organics and inorganics materials have been investigated as PCMs, those encompassing paraffin, fatty acids, salt hydrates, eutectics compounds, among others. Despite many years of research in PCMs, selecting an appropriate material for an aimed application is still a challenge, mainly because of the low thermal conductivity, stability, and supercooling of most common organic and salt hydrate PCMs. The low thermal conductivity has an enormous impact on the design of the LHTES system, requiring complicated and costly heat transfer mechanics to charge and discharge the thermal storage [24,25]. Metallic materials provide relatively high thermal conductivity, high volumetric heat of fusion, and small volume changes, desirable properties to overcome the mentioned issues. In the early '70s, low melting point MPCMs, as Gallium and eutectic alloy 50Bi-26.7Pb-13.3Sn-10Cd (commercially well known as Wood's metal), were studied for thermal control applications in space vehicles [26], and high-temperature eutectic alloys (343 and 947°C) were characterized for solar applications [27][28][29]. Farkas and Birchenall [29] reported the heat of fusion of eutectics alloys using elements such as Al, Ca, Cu, Mg, P, Si, and Zn. Gasanaliev and Gamataeva [30] characterized metal alloys (between 15.7 to 575°C).At present, many organics and inorganics materials have been investigated as PCMs, those encompassing paraffin, fatty acids, salt hydrates, eutectics compounds, among others.

        <p>In the high-temperature range, mainly for solar LHTES applications, numerous review papers [21,[31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38] reported the thermodynamic properties obtained by [29,30] and highlighted their clear advantages of MPCMs in applications for medium and high temperature. In the low-temperature range, few metallic materials are presented in review papers [21] [37,[39][40][41]. Probably, the review published by Ge et al. [42] is the first dedicated to low melting point metallic PCMs, including about twenty MPCMs with their basic properties in the range of temperature between -38.87 to 271.4°C. There is no consensus on the potential application of metallic materials as PCMs for thermal comfort applications in buildings. Some authors discard the MPCMs due to the high melting point and weight [16,41,43], while others pointed out Gallium and some fusible eutectic bismuth-based alloys as possible MPCMs candidates for building applications [44,45]. The excess weight of MPCMs could be partially offset by the volume reduction and the design simplification of the LHTES due to the high thermal conductivity [21]. In the last years, much of the research efforts in phase change materials have mainly focused on the characterization of thermophysical properties of organic and salt hydrate; for metallic materials, the data found in the literature is incomplete and discrepant [46,47]. Recently, new promising utilizations of metals and alloys for thermal energy storage has appeared in different research areas: miscibility gap alloys [48][49][50][51][52][53][54][55][56], metal-organic framework and shape-stabilized PCMs [57][58][59][60][61], encapulation [62][63][64][65][66][67][68][69].The present work aims to provide an extensive and detailed compilation and analysis of the thermophysical properties of metals and alloys as phase change materials. The information presented includes the fundamental thermophysical properties, the temperature dependence of critical properties from the engineering design point of view, a summary of potential applications, and the main challenges of metallic PCMs. It is hoped that this review provides a database of metallic PCMs to facilitate the selection, evaluation, insight into innovative applications, research gaps and new research trends in the area. However, MPCMs have not been systematically studied or evaluated for LHTES applications due to their main drawbacks: weight and cost [16,33,37,39,42,70]. The high thermal conductivity is the main advantage of the MPCMs highlighted by many authors [32,33,37,42,70,71], and this can simplify enormously the design of thermal energy storage, eliminating the need for heat transfer enhancement techniques.In the high-temperature range, mainly for solar LHTES applications, numerous review papers [21,[31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38] reported the thermodynamic properties obtained by [29,30] and highlighted their clear advantages of MPCMs in applications for medium and high temperature.

        <p>Metallic PCMs are good candidates to compete with salts in high-temperature applications because of their high volumetric heat of fusion and excellent thermal reliability [21,30,35]. The hightemperature applications are generally associated with concentrated solar power plants, solar energy storage, steam generators, industrial waste-heat recovery. The binary and ternary eutectic alloys of Al, Cu, Mg, Si, and Zn (relatively abundant elements) provide the highest latent heat values, as can be observed in Fig. 1.Metallic PCMs are good candidates to compete with salts in high-temperature applications because of their high volumetric heat of fusion and excellent thermal reliability [21,30,35].

        <p>In this range of temperature, the most studied alloys were proposed by Birchenall and Riechman [27], mainly the Al-Si alloys [72][73][74][75][76] and Al-Mg-Zn alloys [77] due to their high heat of fusion and relatively low cost [78]. The principal candidate for Al-Si alloys is its eutectic composition, AlSi12, it has been studied as a heat storage medium in domestic heaters [72,79], in steam generators [78,[80][81][82], in heater for electric and hybrid vehicles [23], in a heat exchanger for industrial heat waste recovery [74], in concentrated solar power plants [83], packed bed LHTES system [84]. In Al-Si alloys, the storage capacity increase with the concentration of Si and the thermal conductivity decrease, as is shown in Fig. 3 [72]. Fig. 4 shows the temperature dependence for specific heat and thermal conductivity obtained by Wang et al. [85] at different cycles. The compatibility and corrosion problems of Al-Si alloys in high-temperature applications have been studied with graphite-carbon encapsulation material [73], ceramic encapsulation material [64,86], Al2O3 shell encapsulation [87], honeycomb ceramic encapsulation [88], ceramic coated stainless-steel [89], Al2O3@Cu multilayer shell [90]. Recently, Li et al. [91] investigated a microstructured metal-based composite that consists of aluminium as PCM and alumina as a skeleton structural supporting material as a solution for the leakage of corrodible liquid PCMs. Lao et al. [88] results showed a reduction of the latent heat of Al-Si alloys due to the gradual oxidation of Al, losing the storage capacity after the complete transformation of Al to Al2O3. Kotze et al. [78,[80][81][82] pointed out that pure aluminum or eutectic silicon-magnesium alloy were more suitable in practice than AlSi12. Sun et al. [77] studied the thermal reliability and corrosion of the Al-34Mg-6Zn (wt.%) and observed that the latent heat of fusion of the alloy decreased 10.98% after 1000 cycles, and the melting temperature changed between 3 to 5K due to the degradation of the chemical structure of the alloy. The laboratories of CIC Energigune systematically investigated the possibility of using Mg-Zn and Mg-Zn-Al alloys [46,[92][93][94][95][96] for TES in direct steam generation in concentrated solar power applications and for high pressure and high energy steam processes. The selected alloys were Mg-51Zn (wt.%) eutectic [93] and Mg70Zn24.9Al5.1 eutectic [95] due to the quasi-constant phase change temperatures (eutectic nature), high heat transfer capacity and better thermal stability [94] [97]. The Zn-rich eutectic alloys, as Zn92.2Mg7.8 (at.%), also showed potentiality as MPCMs for their use at CSP plants [47]. Fig. 5a shows the thermal conductivity of the Zn-based alloys, and Fig. 5b is the graphic representation of the specific heat values measured by Risueno et al. [47]. The encapsulation of Cu-based alloys has also been evaluated as a solution to the packaging and corrosion problems. The encapsulation materials include copper capsules coated with refractory metallic shells [62], Fe-shell/Cu-core structure [98], SiC/C-shells/Fe-core capsules [66], graphite-carbon encapsulation material [99].In this range of temperature, the most studied alloys were proposed by Birchenall and Riechman [27], mainly the Al-Si alloys [72][73][74][75][76] and Al-Mg-Zn alloys [77] due to their high heat of fusion and relatively low cost [78].

        <p>Fang et al. [100][101][102] investigated Mg-based alloys as MPCM for TES applications from 400 °C to 600 °C (solar thermal power generation), claiming that its corrosion resistance with encapsulation materials based on iron is higher than Al-based MPCMs. The measured specific heat and thermal conductivity as a function of the temperature are shown in Fig. 6 for Mg-Bi alloys. The authors found that in Mg-Si alloys, the thermal conductivity decreased with increasing Si content [100]. The thermal expansion increased with rising temperature for Mg-Bi alloys, and the thermal conductivity decreased with increasing Bi content [101].

        <p>Xie et al. [76] calculated the thermodynamic data of six Al-based alloys using CALPHAD and compared them with the measured properties using DSC (see Table 1). The results showed that the enthalpy value of Al-4Cu-12Mg-7Si alloy is 85% higher than that of Al-13Si near eutectic alloy, and its initial temperature of phase transformation is about 74°C lower. The authors also pointed out that thermodynamic calculation is valuable in seeking new potential solar energy thermal storage materials for solar thermal power generation systems. Gokon et al. [103] studied the eutectic and hypereutectic compositions of the Fe-Ge alloys as a promised candidate for the next generation of solar thermal applications. Wei et al.

        <p>An innovative approach to avoid high-temperature packaging problems is based on using the thermal effect of solid-solid metallic PCMs (Fe-based), which present lower latent heat than solid-liquid transformations (below 60 kJ/kg) [38,106]. Another solution is the miscibility gap binary alloys (MGA), where one of the alloy components melts (high latent heat) while the other stays solid as a continuous, dense, thermally conductive matrix [50][51][52]. Sugo et al. [48,49,107] proposed an MGA system as high energy-density thermal storage material. They tested two prototypes, Al-Sn and Fe-Cu, claiming that these systems can compete with conventional PCMs due to their high thermal conductivity, high energy density, corrosion resistance, and stability. Recently, Confalonieri et al. [56,[108][109][110] studied the production methods for MGA based on Al-Sn as phase change material finding the Al-40Sn (wt.%) the most promising alloy.

        <p>The latent heat of fusion for the MPCMs in the range of 300 to 900°C is shown in Fig. 7. The melting temperature of Zinc-based alloys is in the range of 337 to 419°C, approximately, and the average reported heat of fusion is lower than 150 kJ/kg. The Zn-Mg alloy compositions close to the eutectic point are the most studied alloys in this range of temperatures because of their high latent heat of fusion. Albased alloys were principally investigated in the range of 440 to 660°C, as is shown in Fig. 7. The Mgbased alloys in the same temperature range show the lowest values of latent heat of fusion, whereas the Al-Si have the highest values. The average reported heat of fusion for Al-based alloys is higher than 300 kJ/kg, and the thermal conductivity is higher than Zn-based alloys. As a rule, the alloys with a high content of Si have the higher values of latent heat of fusion, as shown in Fig. 1.

        <p>Lead (Pb) is listed as one of the chemical elements that represent a significant threat to human life and the environment by the European Union's RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The lead was banned from all new electronic consumer products in the EU from 2006 [134,135] because of the environmental hazard of electronic waste with Pb. For that reason, in the last 30 years, there have been intensive research and development on lead-free alloys [136][137][138][139][140][141][142][143][144][145][146][147][148][149][150][151], and Lead-free solder databases have been created [148,152,153]. The primary lead-free candidates to substitute the Pb-Sn eutectic solder are Sn-Ag-Cu near eutectic, Sn-Zn eutectic, and Sn-Bi eutectic alloys. Among them, the strongest candidate is Sn-(3-4)Ag-(0.5-0.9)Cu (wt.%) [137]. Abtew and Selvaduray [136] summarised some of the Pb-free solder alloy compositions proposed for microelectronics assemblies. The studies were focused on the factor that affects the soldering applications as melting point, mechanical properties, wetting characteristics, availability, and cost.Lead (Pb) is listed as one of the chemical elements that represent a significant threat to human life and the environment by the European Union's RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

The reported thermophysical properties of medium-temperature MPCMs is limited because they were mainly developed for soldering purposes. There are some omitted and confusing information reported in the published literature of low-melting-point multi-component alloys. Some research groups make efforts to characterize the thermophysical properties and to evaluate the stability of MPCMs. Li and Chung [34] studied the performance of binary alloys Sn-based alloys (including some non-lead-free alloys) for TES applications. They found that the latent heat and thermal conductivity of the Sn-9Zn alloy decreased by approximately 5% after 500 thermal cycles. Meydaneri et al. [180] characterized the thermal conductivity of eutectic alloy Sn-3.5Ag (wt.%) as a function of the temperature. Singh et al. [115], testing bismuth rich Cu-Bi alloys for energy storage and surge protection, pointed out their high thermal stability. Zhou et al. [129] synthesized and systemically investigated the fundamental data of low-melting-point eutectic alloys composed of Bi, Cd, Sn, Pb, and In elements (see Table 3). Shamberger et al. [169] measured the latent heat of fusion of the ternary alloys Sn-Pb-Bi and In-Sn-Bi ternary systems and decouple mixing and electronic contributions (see Table 3). Yang et al. [181] investigated experimentally and numerically the eutectic alloy 31,6Bi-48,8In-19,6Sn (wt.%) as PCM for potential thermal management applications; the alloy showed good repeatability and stability without supercooling. Mawire and Shobo [182] examined the potential of the alloy In-48Sn (wt.%) as PCM for heating applications at medium-temperature; the alloy provides excellent properties as low vapour pressure, thermal stability, congruent melting, and solidification, large volumetric storage capacity, and very small supercooling. Venkitaraj and Suresh [183] experimentally investigated the performance of an organic Solid-Solid/Low Melting Alloy (Bi, Sn, Zn, In) composite PCM for TES applications. The alloy was used as an effective additive for improving the thermal performance of organic PCMs. The thermal storage/ release test showed a reduction of 14.64% and 30.22% in the time taken for total energy compared to pure organic PCM. Although thermal energy storage is considered a prospective application for mediumtemperature MPCMs [42], the number of studies in this temperature range is reduced compared to hightemperature MPCMs. In this temperature range, the heats of fusion of the metal alloys are below 60 kJ/kg (see Fig. 9), therefore they can be competitive where the minimum volume is a critical requirement, and the weight penalty is acceptable [154].Table 3 summarised the thermophysical properties reported in the literature cited for lead-free alloys between 40C and 300C.

        <p>• The set of thermophysical properties found in the published literature for MPCMs is generally not completed, dispersed, conflicted, and subjected to uncertainties. The lack of an MPCM thermophysical properties handbook is a significant barrier in developing potential applications because of the resources needed to characterize the PCM. In summary, there is a definite necessity to generate an "MPCM Handbook" to design, study, and evaluate the MPCMs in LHTES engineering applications. • The classification by temperature range of the MPCMs, evidenced that metallics materials have been mostly studied in the high-temperature range, mainly for solar energy thermal storage. MPCMs have not been studied thoroughly for the medium and low-temperature range because of their low specific latent heat, high cost and weight, and container corrosion problems. • Many researchers pointed out as the main disadvantage of MPCMs for LHTES is their elevated weight. However, It could be in part balance with a detailed analysis of the LHTES system, where the reduction of the storage volume and the simplified design due to the high thermal conductivity can bring significant advantages. Also, recent research trends evaluate the use of composite or hybrid PCMs combining metal and other organic/inorganic materials. • The most studied MPCMs for medium-temperature applications are non-compliant with Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) directives and similar international environmental legislation. MPCMs with banned substances (as lead, cadmium) are not recommended for thermal storage applications with potential risk to the environment or health. • In high-temperature applications, the most severe problem of MPCMs is their chemical compatibility with containers, also applicable for salt hydrate. The study of encapsulations or packaging technologies of MPCMs and their long-term compatibility with the container is a fundamental research topic for developing this technology in practical applications. • In low-temperature applications, gallium and Ga-based alloys are the dominant metallic materials.• The set of thermophysical properties found in the published literature for MPCMs is generally not completed, dispersed, conflicted, and subjected to uncertainties.
