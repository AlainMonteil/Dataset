        <p>New ultrathin and multifunctional electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials are required for protecting electronics against electromagnetic pollution in the fifth-generation networks and Internet of Things era. Micrometer-thin Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene films have shown the best EMI shielding performance among synthetic materials so far. Yet, the effects of elemental composition, layer structure, and transition metal arrangement on EMI shielding properties of MXenes have not been explored, despite the fact that more than 30 different MXenes have been reported and many more are possible. Here, we report on a systematic study of EMI shielding properties of 16 different MXenes, which cover single-metal MXenes, ordered double-metal carbide MXenes, and random solid solution MXenes of M and X elements. This is the largest set of MXene compositions ever reported in a comparative study. Films with thicknesses ranging from nanometers to micrometers were produced by spin-casting, spray-coating, and vacuumassisted filtration. All MXenes achieved effective EMI shielding (&gt;20 dB) in micrometer-thick films. The EMI shielding effectiveness of sprayed Ti 3 C 2 T x film with a thickness of only ~40 nm reaches 21 dB. Adjustable EMI shielding properties were achieved in solid solution MXenes with different ratios of elements. A transfer matrix model was shown to fit EMI shielding data for highly conductive MXenes, but could not describe the behavior of materials with low conductivity. This work shows that many members of the large MXene family can be used for EMI shielding, contributing to designing ultrathin, flexible, and multifunctional EMI shielding films benefitting from specific characteristics of individual MXenes.New ultrathin and multifunctional electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials are required for protecting electronics against electromagnetic pollution in the fifth-generation networks and Internet of Things era.

        <p>The arrival of commercial fifth generation (5G; 450 MHz-52 GHz) networks and a significant increase in the number of wireless Internet of Things (IoT) devices working across diverse frequency ranges made communication stability and security without electromagnetic interference (EMI) a critical requirement. 1 Specifically, for flexible wearable devices and miniaturized electronics with complex architectures, such as electronic skins, sensors, Bluetooth components, etc., it has become more challenging to confront the selective jamming in different frequency ranges. 2 Conventional metals (Ag, Cu, Ni, and others) provide excellent barriers against electromagnetic waves, but metal foils cannot be used in tiny microelectronic devices and deposition of thin metal films onto uneven device surfaces is not an easy task. 3,4 In addition, EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) of metal coatings is limited by the skin depths of metals, decreasing efficiency of ultrathin metal coatings and limiting their use in wearable and portable electronic devices. 5 Graphene, which has low density, high strength, and excellent chemical stability, was considered until recently as the most promising alternative to replace metals for EMI shielding. 6,7 In 2016, Ti 3 C 2 T x (T x represents the surface termination groups) MXene films were demonstrated to have outstanding EMI shielding capability at micrometer-scale thickness, outperforming both metals and carbon materials (graphene, carbon nanotubes and carbon fibers). 8 Since then, tremendous efforts focused on optimizing the EMI shielding performance of Ti 3 C 2 T x and manufacturing of Ti 3 C 2 T x aerogels, Ti 3 C 2 T x /polymer composites, and Ti 3 C 2 T x /carbon hybrids. [9][10][11][12][13][14] MXenes are produced by a scalable selective etching in acidic solutions, that leads to -O, -OH and -F surface terminations making them solution-processable and available for various coating manufacturing techniques, including spray-coating, spin-casting, inkjet printing, dip-coating and interfacial assembly. [15][16][17][18] In addition, these functionalized surfaces facilitate adhesion and bonding to substrates. All the above advantages indicate that MXene is an alternative to the conventional metals and carbon materials for EMI shielding. However, few studies have explored the EMI shielding properties of MXenes other than Ti 3 C 2 T x , although more than 30 kinds of MXenes with different compositions and structures have been published. 19 MXenes are typically synthesized from MAX phases, which have the general formula M n+1 AX n (n=1-4). 20 There are three common MAX phase structures, M 2 AX, M 3 AX 2 and M 4 AX 3 , where M represents the early transition metal, A is an A-group element of group 13 to 15 of the periodic table, and X is carbon and/or nitrogen. 21,22 Consequently, MXenes commonly have three structures: M 2 XT x , M 3 X 2 T x and M 4 X 3 T x , as shown in Figure 1. Based on the different M and X elements, they can also be sorted as mono-metal MXenes, double-metal (M′ and M″) MXenes, and double-X (C and N -carbonitrides) solid solution MXenes. Double-metal MXenes exist in two different forms, depending on the distribution of M′ and M″ metals: 1) solid solution MXenes where the M-sites are randomly occupied by two kinds of metal atoms and 2) ordered MXenes where the M′ and M″ elements are separated into different layers (Figure 1). To date, most MXenes show active surfaces and good dispersion in water and some organic solvents due to the acid-etching process. 23 Therefore, the MXene family is a promising platform for multifunctional EMI shielding coatings/devices. Despite the fact that the EMI shielding properties of Ti 3 C 2 T x have been explored extensively, little is known about the effects of layer structure, elemental composition, or metal element arrangement on EMI shielding performance. Here, we synthesized 16 different MXenes, comprising various elemental compositions and structures that include the three primary classes of MXenes, including mono-metal MXenes, ordered double-metal MXenes, and random solid solution MXenes (Figure 1). The EMI shielding performance of MXene films with the thicknesses from nano to microscale has been investigated. Fitting of the results for different MXenes with a transfer matrix model provides some insights into the relationships between their EMI shielding properties and frequency/thickness/electrical conductivity.

        <p>Sixteen different MAX phases, including mono-M (Ti 2 AlC 2 , V 2 AlC 2 , and Nb 2 AlC 2 ) and solid solution M 2 AX (Ti y Nb 2-y AlC and Nb y V 2-y AlC (y = 0.4, 0.8, 1.2 and 1.6)), M 3 AX 2 (Ti 3 AlC 2 , Ti 3 AlCN and Mo 2 TiAlC 2 ), and M 4 AX 3 (Nb 4 AlC 3 and Mo 2 Ti 2 AlC 2 ), were initially synthesized. All synthesis conditions were summarized in Table S1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all MAX phases are shown in Figure S2. Correspondingly, 16 different MXenes were obtained by the selective removal of the Al layers from MAX phase precursors using different etching and delamination processes. Figure 1 shows the freestanding MXene films prepared via vacuum-assisted filtration from the colloidal MXene solutions. MXenes have widely differing optical properties, which can be visually observed in the freestanding films. 17,24 These films represent the primary MXene categories: A) mono-M MXenes. Ti 2 CT x (green), Nb 2 CT x (gold), V 2 CT x (bronze), Ti 3 C 2 T x (purple) and Nb 4 C 3 T x (dark grey); B) double-X MXene. Ti 3 CNT x (violet black); C) double-M MXenes. Mo 2 TiC 2 T x (silver grey), Mo 2 Ti 2 C 3 T x (silver), Ti y Nb 2-y CT x and Nb y V 2-y CT x . Of these, Mo 2 TiC 2 T x and Mo 2 Ti 2 C 3 T x are ordered with the arrangement of Mo-Ti-Mo and Mo-Ti-Ti-Mo, respectively. 25 Ti y Nb 2-y CT x and Nb y V 2-y CT x are random solid solutions whose colors change based on their specific chemical compositions. All the elemental ratios for Ti y Nb 2-y CT x and Nb y V 2-y CT x are based on compositions of solid solution MAX phases, assuming no transition metal loss during etching. Complete delamination of all MXenes was confirmed by XRD patterns of the MXene films (Figure S3). All of them show a prominent (002) diffraction peak of MXene at 2θ = ~5.3-7.3°. For all systems where the MAX is converted to MXene, the Al layer is removed, and replaced with the surface terminations, in addition to water and intercalants between the layers, leading to enlarged d-spacing compared to MAX phase precursors. 26 Hence, the observed d-spacing values are related to both the thickness of the MXene flakes (n) and the intercalants. For example, the (002) peaks d-spacing of Ti 2 AlC, Ti 3 AlC 2 , and Nb 4 AlC 3 is 6.7 Å (2θ = 13.1°), 9.2 Å (2θ = 9.60°), and 12.0 Å (2θ = 7.36°), respectively. After conversion of these MAX phases into MXenes, the (002) peak d-spacing of Ti 2 CT x , Ti 3 C 2 T x , and Nb 4 C 3 T x increased to 12.1 Å (2θ = 7.28°), 12.6 Å (2θ = 7.00°), and 16.6 Å (2θ = 5.32°), respectively. The d-spacing expansion from M 2 XT x , M 3 X 2 T x to M 4 X 3 T x can be due to the presence of intercalants, such as TMAOH, used to delaminate MXene, and water molecules.Sixteen different MAX phases, including mono-M (Ti 2 AlC 2 , V 2 AlC 2 , and Nb 2 AlC 2 ) and solid solution M 2 AX (Ti y Nb 2-y AlC and Nb y V 2-y AlC (y = 0.4, 0.8, 1.2 and 1.6)), M 3 AX 2 (Ti 3 AlC 2 , Ti 3 AlCN and Mo 2 TiAlC 2 ), and M 4 AX 3 (Nb 4 AlC 3 and Mo 2 Ti 2 AlC 2 ), were initially synthesized.

        <p>For MXene films with a thickness of ~2 nm, we used a 130 μm-thick glass slide with negligible EMI SE as substrate (Figure S4), and deposited Ti 2 CT x and Ti 3 C 2 T x films by spin-casting. Spraycoating was used to fabricate &lt; 150 nm Ti 2 CT x and Ti 3 C 2 T x films. Using vacuum-assisted filtration of the colloidal MXene solutions, ~1-15 μm thick MXene films were prepared. All vacuum-filtered MXene films were freestanding and flexible, which is attributed to the 2D morphology of the delaminated MXene flakes (Figure 2a,b). All MXenes investigated here have similar 2D morphologies with varying lateral dimensions. As an example, Ti 2 CT x flakes and films are presented in Figure 2a-d. Both spray-coated films and filtered films show a similar aligned layered structure in cross-section (Figures 2c and2d). It is noteworthy that the spraycoated films have better (more planar) stacking order than the filtered films owing to the layerby-layer drying process. This was further confirmed by surface roughness analysis of spin-cast and spray-coated films using optical and SEM images (Figure S5). The density of spray-coated Ti 3 C 2 T x films was ~3.8 g cm -3 while that of filtered Ti 3 C 2 T x films was ~2.7 g cm -3 . The more uniform stacked layers lead to a higher film density (better interflake contact), which results in a higher electrical conductivity. (SE T , SE R and SE A ) values in the X-band for different MXenes with a similar thickness (5 ± 0.3 μm) is shown in Figure 2h. MXenes with higher SE T exhibit higher SE R and SE A values simultaneously, indicating that MXenes with higher EMI shielding capability have a higher contribution from EM wave reflection. Typically, the SE T , SE R and SE A values for Ti y Nb 2-y CT x and Nb y V 2-y CT x decrease with increasing amounts of Nb. For M 3 X 2 T x MXenes, the average SE T , SE R and SE A of Ti 3 C 2 T x reach 57.4 dB, 17.5 dB and 39.9 dB, respectively, while Ti 3 CNT x values are 49.7 dB, 17 dB and 32.7 dB, respectively. We synthesized Ti 3 C 2 T x and Ti 3 CNT x using the same etching (HF and HCl) and delamination (LiCl) methods. It suggests that the mono-X MXene has better EMI shielding performance than the double-X MXene (carbonitride). For ordered double-M MXene, Mo 2 TiC 2 T x , whose outer metal layers are Mo, shows a much lower EMI shielding capability, in comparison with Ti 3 C 2 T x .For MXene films with a thickness of ~2 nm, we used a 130 μm-thick glass slide with negligible EMI SE as substrate (Figure S4), and deposited Ti 2 CT x and Ti 3 C 2 T x films by spin-casting.

        <p>Because EMI shielding properties are sensitive to the thickness of the shielding layers, we measured the EMI shielding performance of all MXene films over a wide range of thicknesses, and applied a model based on the transfer matrix method to validate them. Figure 3a illustrates the continuum multi-layer structure with a plane EM wave (far-field) at normal incidence to single MXene layers with interlayered free space (details of calculations are presented in Supporting Information). Generally, Simon's formula is the most common approach to verify the EMI shielding performance for highly conductive materials with thicknesses above the skin depth (d ≫ δ). 27 However, it is not applicable to nanometer-and submicrometer-thick MXene films. The advantage of the transfer matrix modeling for ultrathin shielding layers, compared to Simon's formula that neglects multiple reflection between the layers, is shown in Figure S1. In absence of a model capturing the physics behind interactions of atomically thin materials and EM waves 28 , this looks like the best option available today.Because EMI shielding properties are sensitive to the thickness of the shielding layers, we measured the EMI shielding performance of all MXene films over a wide range of thicknesses, and applied a model based on the transfer matrix method to validate them.

The thickness of single-layer Ti 3 C 2 T x and Ti 2 CT x flakes was measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM, Figure S6). The film thickness was calculated based on the transmittance and the absorption coefficients of Ti 3 C 2 T x and Ti 2 CT x films at 550 nm wavelength (details in Figure S7). 29,30 The visible transmittance and color change with the increasing film thickness of Ti 3 C 2 T x and Ti 2 CT x films are shown in Figure S8. Figure 3c shows the EMI SE T values of various nanometers-thick Ti 3 C 2 T x and Ti 2 CT x films at 10 GHz. As the Ti 3 C 2 T x films thickness increases from ~2 nm to 137 nm, the SE T value increases from 1.4 dB to 33 dB. It is highly significant that at ~40 nm film thickness, the SE T value reaches 21 dB, indicating that more than 99% of the EM waves have been intercepted. For Ti 2 CT x films, at 94 nm film thickness, the SE T value reaches 13 dB, which is equivalent in shielding to a ~14 nm-thick Ti 3 C 2 T x film. The gray line shows the simulated results using the transfer matrix model with the electrical conductivity.

        <p>The SE T values of Ti 3 C 2 T x and Ti 2 CT x films decrease with the increasing frequency in the Xband (Figure S9a,b).

        <p>We further measured the total EMI SE values of all the vacuum-filtered MXene films with thicknesses ranging from ~1 to 15 μm. As shown in Figure 3d, the SE T values of all the films show a nonlinear monotonic increase with the thickness, in fairly good agreement with the simulated results from the electrical conductivity values (gray line). This statistical result demonstrates that the transfer matrix model is more suitable for predicting the EMI shielding properties of thin films, as opposed to Simon's formula which predicts a linear relationship ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Nano 12 between thickness and EMI SE. Significantly, except Nb 2 CT x , all studied MXene films achieved SE T &gt; 20 dB below 10 μm thickness, including M 2 XT x (Ti 2 CT x and V 2 CT x ), M 3 X 2 T x (Ti 3 C 2 T x , Ti 3 CNT x and Mo 2 TiC 2 T x ), and M 4 X 3 T x (Nb 4 C 3 T x and Mo 2 Ti 2 C 3 T x ). In particular, Ti 3 C 2 T x , Ti 3 CNT x , Ti 2 CT x , V 2 CT x and Mo 2 Ti 2 C 3 T x films show SE T &gt; 20 dB below 2.5 μm film thickness.We further measured the total EMI SE values of all the vacuum-filtered MXene films with thicknesses ranging from ~1 to 15 μm.

This statistical result demonstrates that the transfer matrix model is more suitable for predicting the EMI shielding properties of thin films, as opposed to Simon's formula which predicts a linear relationship ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Nano 12 between thickness and EMI SE. Significantly, except Nb 2 CT x , all studied MXene films achieved SE T &gt; 20 dB below 10 μm thickness, including M 2 XT x (Ti 2 CT x and V 2 CT x ), M 3 X 2 T x (Ti 3 C 2 T x , Ti 3 CNT x and Mo 2 TiC 2 T x ), and M 4 X 3 T x (Nb 4 C 3 T x and Mo 2 Ti 2 C 3 T x ).

        <p>MXene structure. The EMI shielding properties of two kinds of solid solution MXenes (Nb y V 2- y CT x and Ti y Nb 2-y CT x ) were also measured and modeled at different thicknesses. Compared to pure Ti 2 CT x , V 2 CT x and Nb 2 CT x , the SE T values of Nb y V 2-y CT x monotonically increase with the V content, likewise with Ti y Nb 2-y CT x and Ti content (Figure 3e,f). Additionally, both show excellent EMI shielding capabilities; Ti y Nb 2-y CT x and Nb y V 2-y CT x films can achieve SE T &gt; 20 dB below 4 μm and 8 μm film thicknesses, respectively. This suggests that, in addition to Ti 3 C 2 T x , many other MXenes can be used as thin EMI shielding coatings, although the performance of Ti 3 C 2 T x is still the best, possibly due to the optimized synthesis process that minimized the concentration of defects and maximized the conductivity compared to initial reports. 13,14 This is important as MXenes offer a variety of colors, mechanical, electrical and other properties, enabling development of multifunctional EMI shielding films and coatings. Furthermore, the EMI shielding performance is demonstrated to be tunable by control of the chemistry of solid-solution MXenes over a broad range of thicknesses and compositions. The frequency-dependent EMI SE values of all MXene films with different thicknesses can be found in Figure S10. Notably, the electrical conductivity of the sprayed Ti 3 C 2 T x films is ~14000 S cm -1 , compared to the vacuum-filtered films (~8500 S cm -1 ). This is attributed to better alignment and denser packing of MXene layers in the sprayed films (Figure S5).MXene structure.

        <p>MXene films, we measured the electrical conductivity of all vacuum-filtered MXene films using the four-point probe method. As shown in Figure 4a, Ti-based MXenes (Ti 3 C 2 T x , Ti 3 CNT x , Ti 2 CT x , and Ti 1.6 Nb 0.4 CT x ) along with V 2 CT x , exhibit electrical conductivity higher than 1000 S cm -1 , while Nb-based MXenes have relatively low electrical conductivity. It is noteworthy that the conductivity of MXenes varies with different synthesis processes and precursors. For the solid solution MXenes studied, the electrical conductivity of Ti y Nb 2-y CT x and Nb y V 2-y CT x films decreases with the increasing Nb content, consistent with the change of EMI shielding performance. This indicates that both the electrical conductivity and EMI shielding capability of MXenes are adjustable via their chemical composition.MXene films, we measured the electrical conductivity of all vacuum-filtered MXene films using the four-point probe method.

        <p>We further simulated the total EMI SE of MXene films with a thickness of 5 μm using the transfer matrix modeling at frequency of 10 GHz, and compared the modeled values to experimentally measured electrical conductivity and SE T . As shown in Figure 4b, for MXenes with an electrical conductivity of &gt; 100 S cm -1 , the measured values are in close agreement with the simulated results (gray line), showing a nonlinear increase of SE T with the increasing conductivity. However, for MXenes with an electrical conductivity of &lt; 100 S cm -1 , the measured SE T values are larger than predicted. This mismatch between the experimental results and theoretical calculations implies that the electrical conductivity is not the only factor responsible for EMI shielding performance of MXenes. On one hand, our theoretical calculations using both the transfer matrix model and Simon's formula do not take into account dielectric polarization effect. The dielectric interactions between the incident EM wave and MXene layers are barely detected for those MXenes with higher conductivity, since the strong interaction between abundant free electrons of highly conductive MXene and incident EM wave dominates the shielding behavior. However, for MXenes with relatively low electrical conductivity, like Nb 2 CT x , the contribution of dielectric interactions between EM wave and the materials to EM wave dissipation is not negligible. MXenes have abundant surface groups and point defects caused by the acid-etching process, as well as adsorbed TMA ions between the layers. 31,32 They may experience strong polarization accompanied with relaxation loss in the altered EM field, contributing to EM wave absorption. On the other hand, both the transfer matrix model and Simon's formula do not take into account the difference between AC conductivity and DC conductivity for MXenes in the X-band. The frequency-dependent conductivity behavior of different MXenes at gigahertz frequencies is not known, although AC conductivity usually asymptotically approaches the DC conductivity for metals and carbon materials. [33][34][35] Further investigation is required to quantify the dielectric properties and AC conductivities of MXenes for better understanding of the interaction between EM waves and MXenes. Also, physical models accounting for nanometer-scale heterogeneity of assembled MXene films should be developed. We have summarized the progress of metal-based hybrids and carbon materials for EMI shielding in recent years, and highlighted the characteristic interval for the MXene films with ~ 2 nm to 15 μm thickness based on the measured EMI shielding properties of different MXenes (details in Table S3).

A transfer matrix model has been shown to fit the EMI shielding performance of MXenes, at least for the most conducting members of the MXene family.
