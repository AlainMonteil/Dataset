        <p>The transport sector accounts for 24% of global CO2 emissions due to the combustion of fossil fuels [1]. It has been reported that internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles are responsible for almost three-quarters of this amount [2]. Under this threatening situation, carbon emission legislations have been set out across the globe to mitigate the harmful effects of climate change [3,4]. Such policies have prompted nations to modernize the automotive sector and develop electrical vehicles (EVs) to decrease their carbon footprint [5]. The UK, for example, plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 and bring all greenhouse gas emissions to netzero by 2050 [6]. Similar targets have been set by other major industrialized countries such as China and the EU [7,8].The transport sector accounts for 24% of global CO2 emissions due to the combustion of fossil fuels [1].

        <p>Although EVs offer a promising alternative to conventional vehicles, they only accounted for 2.6% of global car sales and about 1% of the entire global car stock in 2019 [9,10]. The fundamental barrier to the large-scale adoption of EVs is the limited driving range which combined with insufficient charging infrastructure can lead to "range anxiety" in EV drivers [11][12][13]; the fear of stranding with an empty battery [14]. Currently, most EVs can only go around 100-250 km on a single charge, much shorter than their ICE counterparts [15]. Using larger batteries is not a feasible solution owing to limited space in EVs, additional cost, higher weight, and the requirement of more rare-earth elements [16,17]. Hence, there is a need to enhance the energy density of the existing battery system as the key component that determines the vehicle's performance [18,19].Although EVs offer a promising alternative to conventional vehicles, they only accounted for 2.6% of global car sales and about 1% of the entire global car stock in 2019 [9,10].

        <p>Currently, lithium-ion solid-state batteries are the most commonly used source of power for many low to high-capacity applications, including portable electronics and EVs [20]. While in mobile devices such as cell phones and laptops only a handful of cells are required, up to several thousand cells are inter-connected in EV battery systems to deliver the necessary power. Thus, the cell-to-cell or module level joining is the most critical joining process in battery pack manufacturing which directly influences the battery capacity [21]. The overview of the EV battery pack consisting of cell, module, and pack structure is illustrated in Fig. 1. Fig. 1.

        <p>EV batteries currently use three cell formats: cylindrical, prismatic, and pouch cells (Fig. 2) [22]. The cell tabs are usually made of aluminum, copper, or nickel and are generally connected in parallel or series configurations using steel, aluminum, or copper busbars [21]. Weld joints in EV battery pack involve low-thickness materials (typically 0.3 mm to 1 mm) and the welding process is normally performed in lap, fillet, or spot configuration [23,24]. A typical joint between the Al tab and Cu busbar is presented in Fig. 3 [25]. The differences in thermos-physical properties of dissimilar materials such as melting temperature and thermal conductivity make it difficult to obtain a complete metallurgical bond without considerable cracks and porosities [26].EV batteries currently use three cell formats: cylindrical, prismatic, and pouch cells (Fig. 2) [22].

        <p>Furthermore, the formation of hard and brittle intermetallic compounds (IMCs) at the weld interface greatly reduces the battery's electrical capacity and structural performance. A weak joint cannot withstand the harsh driving environments, dynamic loading, vibrations, and possible crash and might even result in fire due to short-circuiting [27,28]. The presence of IMCs also intensifies the heat generated during charging and discharging cycles due to their low electrical conductivity thereby accelerating the degradation process of the battery. The possibility of corrosion due to the presence of IMCs which deteriorates the joint performance should be considered as well [29].Furthermore, the formation of hard and brittle intermetallic compounds (IMCs) at the weld interface greatly reduces the battery's electrical capacity and structural performance.

        <p>Atmospheric, localized, crevice, pitting, and galvanic are the most known types of corrosion that can happen here [30]. Corrosion not only degrades the mechanical performance joints but also increases the connection's electrical resistance [31].

        <p>Each of these techniques has its advantages and limitations and is used based on cell type, properties, and thickness of the materials involved [20]. Other joining processes such as soldering, friction stir welding, micro-TIG or pulsed arc welding, joining by forming, and adhesive bonding have also been proposed [34][35][36][37][38]. However, due to the lack of information at present, further research is needed to thoroughly investigate their feasibility [21].Each of these techniques has its advantages and limitations and is used based on cell type, properties, and thickness of the materials involved [20].

        <p>In ultrasonic welding, a high-frequency (typically 20 kHz or above) ultrasonic vibration is applied under pressure to join substrates [20]. Oxides and contamination on the surfaces are removed during the welding and the result is a metallurgical bond created without melting, based on diffusion and adhesion of the softened metals [39,40]. UW can produce good welds (without porosity, hot-cracks, and bulk intermetallics) between highly conductive dissimilar metals, and has been considered particularly superior for pouch cells. However, it can damage the structural integrity of cylindrical and prismatic cells due to the high frequency of vibration. It is also restricted to lap joints [20]. Wire bonding can be defined as single-sided ultrasonic welding of a small diameter Ag, Cu, or Al wire (typically below 0.5 mm), first to one substrate and then to the second or more substrates sequentially [22]. It is a technique frequently used in semiconductor device technology [21], and regardless of no scientific literature on its application in EV battery manufacturing, wire bonding has been employed in Tesla Model-S to connect battery cells and busbars [20].

        <p>When a high current passes through the interface, it creates localized heating and melting, resulting in fusion welding of substrates [41]. However, resistance spot welding of highly conductive materials like aluminum and copper remains challenging and currently, it is only suitable for lowconductivity materials [20,42]. Laser welding is a highly efficient fusion welding technique with the advantages of creating a narrow heat-affected zone and a small targeted deformation [43].When a high current passes through the interface, it creates localized heating and melting, resulting in fusion welding of substrates [41].

        <p>Compared to other main welding techniques for EV battery pack manufacturing (i.e., RSW and UW) the lowest electrical contact resistances and highest joint strengths have been reported with laser welding [44]. Laser welding has the potential to be used for module-level joining of all three types of lithium-ion cells [20]. However, A poor metallurgical affinity between dissimilar materials normally limits the laser welding process and leads to potential defects such as hard and brittle intermetallic phases and crack sensitivity. Therefore, further investigation is needed in this area. Studies so far have reported that the joint performance could be improved by optimizing the welding parameters [45]. Furthermore, the applicability of different interlayers and coatings to improve joint properties has been the subject of recent investigations [46]. There have also been recent advances in novel lasers (i.e., blue and green lasers) which allow higher energy absorption on highly reflective surfaces such as Cu and Al [47,48]. This paper presents a comprehensive review on the dissimilar laser welding of the most common joint combinations in EV battery system including steel-copper, steel-aluminum, aluminum-copper, and steel-nickel. The fundamental metallurgical and structural challenges are discussed and the latest developments in process optimization have been highlighted to provide a basis for further studies on this topic.Compared to other main welding techniques for EV battery pack manufacturing (i.e., RSW and UW) the lowest electrical contact resistances and highest joint strengths have been reported with laser welding [44].

        <p>Most of these studies focused on laser welding of stainless steel and pure copper. It has been suggested by some authors that the key to a high-quality joint between copper and steel is reducing the intermixing of molten steel and copper by keeping the Cu in solid-state mainly by using laser beam offset or beam deflection towards the steel side. This suppresses the metastable phase separation during welding, preventing weld cracks and HAZ microfissures [53][54][55]. Mai and Spowage [45] produced butt joints between 1 mm medium carbon tool steel and copper by focusing the beam 0.2 mm towards steel in order to minimize the melting of Cu. While the top of steel completely melted a lack of fusion was observed between Cu and the weld metal. They suggested preheating the joint or using a higher power density as possible solutions which can improve the joint quality. Yao et al. [55] proposed a scarf geometry (i.e., obtuse and acute angles for copper and steel, respectively) for the butt weld configuration with the laser offset towards steel. Fig. 5 shows the schematics of this proposed scarf geometry. Plane thickness and laser power had important effects on the distribution of Cu. Higher thickness (10 mm) and laser power (11KW) reduced the amount of molten copper dissolved in steel compared to the sample with a thickness of 7 mm and a laser power of 8 KW. Fig. 6a and b illustrate the cross-sectional morphology of joints with a high dilution ratio of Cu (~36 at%) and the corresponding EDS intensity profiles of Fe and Cu. The morphology and EDS profiles of the low-dilution (&lt; 1 at%) sample are presented in Fig. 6c andd, respectively. A complete metallurgical bond without cracks and pores along with a higher tensile property was achieved for this sample. Cracks and gas pores can be seen in the high-dilution sample which showed a tensile strength of only 150-200 MPa. An intermixing zone existed adjacent to the Cu plate in both samples. However, it was narrower in the low-dilution sample owing to the lower diffusion of Cu. This transition zone consisted of a large number of granular phases with a composition of Fe-rich bcc solid solution (α-Fe) and Cu-rich fcc solid solution (known as the ε phase) (Fig. 7).Most of these studies focused on laser welding of stainless steel and pure copper.

        <p>Fig. 5. The Scheme of butt configuration with the suggested scarf geometry [55]. Chen et al. [53,56] have reported the microstructural characteristics of laser-welded stainless steel to copper, using an oblique laser. They stated that laser beam inclination towards stainless steel could melt stainless steel while keeping the low-melting-point copper in solid-state, resulting in the "welding-brazing mode". Owing to the low amount of melted Cu it forms a dilute solution in the fusion zone. However, excessive beam offset or welding speed should be avoided since can result in the lack of fusion in the copper and weld zone interface. While in "Welding-brazing mode", liquid separation and microcracks in the fusion zone were prevented in "fusion welding mode" the melt pool entered the metastable miscibility gap and separated into two immiscible liquids of Cu and stainless steel. These two joining modes are shown in Fig. 8. A jagged interface was formed between copper and liquid metal owing to the strong fluid flow of the molten pool during the welding. The composition distribution at the interface during weldingbrazing is presented in Fig. 9. The diffusion of alloying elements of stainless steel (e.g., Fe, Cr, Mn, and Ni) into copper is an indication of a metallurgical bond between copper and stainless steel. The combination of scraggly interfacial morphology and metallurgical bonding resulted in improved mechanical properties in the "welding-brazing" mode. Fig. 9.

        <p>In "fusion welding mode" when partial melting of copper and mixing with the melt pool occurred, the liquid underwent primary and secondary separation owing to the high cooling rate and supercooling of the laser welding process. Fig. 10 illustrates the mechanism of liquid separation in "fusion welding mode". Instantly after entering the miscibility gap the liquid underwent the primary separation creating Fe and Cu liquids. With the lack of full diffusion, the secondary liquid phase separation occurred as the liquid cooled in the miscibility gap resulting in the supersaturation of one or both liquids. The final weld microstructure is an inhomogeneous composite of Cu and stainless steel. Fig. 10. Schematic of liquid separation and its mechanism for fusion welding [53].In "fusion welding mode" when partial melting of copper and mixing with the melt pool occurred, the liquid underwent primary and secondary separation owing to the high cooling rate and supercooling of the laser welding process.

        <p>Fig. 11 shows the presence of cracks at the weld zone in "fusion welding mode". These cracks are believed to be caused by a thermal stress mismatch between stainless steel and copper. It can be seen that copper filled some of these cracks owing to its low melting temperature. A metallurgical bond was formed between the crack surfaces and molten copper creating a self-healing property thereby reducing the negative effects of cracks. Since some of the cracks were filled with molten copper the tensile strength was not influenced because of these cracks. Nevertheless, the toughness and fatigue strength decreased with the increase in the amount of molten copper. Thus, they maintained that the melting of Cu should be kept at a minimum. Li et al. [57] declared HAZ liquation cracking in the stainless steel and fusion zone porosities as the two major defects in laser welding of stainless steel and copper. The existence of Fe-Cu compounds at the HAZ grain boundaries weakened the cohesion between grains and created the susceptibility to cracks. The three stages of liquation cracking formation are presented in Fig. 12.Fig. 11 shows the presence of cracks at the weld zone in "fusion welding mode".

        <p>The first stage is crack incubation at grain boundaries in which Cu atoms permeated along the grain boundaries due to a small resistance. In the second stage, crack initiation Fe-Cu compounds enriched at grain boundaries undermining the cohesion between the grains. Crack growth is the third and final stage. The thermal stresses increased massively with the increase in heat input during the laser welding process, leading to the extension of small cracks into forming big cracks at grain boundaries. Fig. 13 illustrates the relationship between heat input and crack length. The crack length was increased with increasing the heat input till 125 KJ/m, after which it began to fall. This was attributed to the self-healing property of molten copper which filled the cracks. It was believed although crack susceptibility could be lowered with self-healing, to control the weld quality the heat input should be reduced by increasing the welding speed or lowering the laser power. The other major problem, porosities, occurred independently of HAZ liquation cracking. These porosities were the results of keyhole instability correlated with fluid flow. They were successfully removed by beam deflection toward stainless steel that altered the flow of liquid metal and increased the stirring effect during the welding process [57].The first stage is crack incubation at grain boundaries in which Cu atoms permeated along the grain boundaries due to a small resistance.

By using this method, no cracks or pores were found in the weldments. The electrical resistance of the welds was also measured which was more than two times lower than that of stainless steel, indicating a lack of intermetallics in the weld zone.

Other researchers have also reported obtaining sound welds without defects between steel and copper by minimizing the melting of copper either using beam offset or inclining the laser beam towards stainless steel [59][60][61][62].</p>

        <p>They reported that laser welding with the beam focused on the steel side always led to solidification cracks in the weld zone no matter the welding parameters. Therefore, a focus of 0.4 mm toward Cu was used. They reported that when weld metal was enriched with copper (80% of copper in the weld zone) no solidification cracks were detected. Hot crack clusters were observed along the austenite grain boundaries in stainless steel HAZ. However, a high tensile strength of 312 MPa was achieved despite the presence of these cracks. Sahul et al. [64] achieved higher values of tensile strength up to 261 MPa by offsetting the laser beam towards the copper side due to intermixing of both metals. The microstructure of the welds between AISI 304 and Cu is presented in Fig. 14. Fine copper dendrites can be observed at the interface between weld and copper. The interface was also jagged indicating metallurgical bonding. Grain growth was observed in the HAZ of copper. Furthermore, δ ferrite was detected at the interface of stainless steel and weld metal.They reported that laser welding with the beam focused on the steel side always led to solidification cracks in the weld zone no matter the welding parameters.

        <p>Elemental mapping of Cu, Cr, Fe, and Ni are illustrated in Fig. 15. Visible intermixing of elements can be seen, dark zones originating from 304 stainless steel and brighter ones from Cu. Similarly, Weigl and Schmidt [65] and Joshi and Badheka [66] reported the presence of the solidification cracks in the "welding-brazing mode". It was concluded that the presence of Cu within the weld metal was not responsible for the solidification cracks, and by shifting the beam towards the Cu a higher amount of Cu was melted and participated in the weld resulting in better static mechanical strength. Joshi and Badheka [66] believed that beam displacement was not the only way to control solidification cracks. Since compositional gradient within the weld area was the reason for the cracking, detail works on welding parameters are needed to investigate the interaction of steel and copper within the weld metal and its effect on solidification cracks.Elemental mapping of Cu, Cr, Fe, and Ni are illustrated in Fig. 15.

The data available in the public domain shows that several attempts have been made to control intermetallic formation through optimization of process parameters, different heat source modes, and welding techniques. Torkamany et al. [70] laser welded the 0.8 mm thickness low carbon steel (ST14) to 2 mm thick aluminum alloy (AA5754), in the overlap configuration. They concluded that raising the laser power had an adverse effect and created more spatter and intermetallics. The weld microstructure exhibiting the presence of intermetallics at the bottom of the weld is shown in Fig. 19. Due to the formation of these intermetallics, crack propagation was observed in the weld metal and at the weld/Al interface. Increasing the pulse duration also had a similar effect as higher heat input and resulted in the formation of a large number of intermetallic compounds. On the other hand, lowering the pulse duration below a critical level resulted in the lack of fusion.Table 3 Intermetallic compounds in Fe-Al system [73].

        <p>The joint was in lap configuration with steel on top. For the case of higher penetration depth, Alrich intermetallics were formed, while for low penetration depth Fe-rich intermetallics were observed without the presence of any defects thereby enhancing the mechanical properties of the joints. Pereira et al. [77] investigated the optimal welding parameters based on mechanical and microstructural investigations. Two sheets of DP1000 steel and aluminum alloy AA1050 of 1mm thickness were overlap-welded using a pulsed Nd:YAG laser. They reported good quality welds with tensile strengths close to parent AA1050 when laser power was low enough to prevent full penetration into Al. Laser welding of low carbon steel DC04 and aluminum alloy AA6016, both in 1mm thickness, was investigated by Guan et al. [78] using a fiber laser. The focus of their study was to probe the impact of welding process parameters, on the weld bead geometry and the tensile strength. They concluded that the welding speed was the main process parameter influencing the weld properties whereas beam defocus and laser power were secondary factors. Increasing welding speed reduced the Fe-Al reaction time leading to thinner intermetallics and improved the joint strength. The optimal laser welding parameter values were reported as laser power of 1400 W, welding speed 40 mm/s, defocusing 0 mm, and gas flow 35 L/min. A two-pass laser process was utilized by Ma et al. [79] to produce laser welded joints between 0.75 mm DP590 galvanized steel and 1 mm 6061 aluminum. The first pass was intended to melt and partially vaporize the zinc coating whereas the second pass was executed to perform the welding. They declared that laser power and speed should be adjusted to vaporize the Zn coating but prevent creating extensive plasma. The best mechanical properties were achieved when the thickness of the Al-rich intermetallic layer was kept around 5 µm. Borrisutthekul et al. [80] investigated the impact of a backing plate (heat sink) in the suppression of intermetallics formation. Fig. 20 illustrates the dependence of weld strength on intermetallic thickness. As can be seen, the weld strength increased with the reduction of intermetallic thickness. They claimed that higher welding speeds and a backing plate with higher conductivity could reduce the thickness of the intermetallic layer leading to a higher weld strength.

        <p>A relatively novel approach in welding aluminum with steel is using different coatings and interlayers to tailor the intermetallic formation for improved mechanical properties. It has been found that transition metal elements like Mn, Zr, Sn, Ni, and Zn have an inhibitory effect on Fe-Al metallurgical reactions. For example, Jia et al. [87] maintained that the presence of Zinc in galvanized steel during laser welding/brazing created Fe2Al5Zn0.4, a ductile and tough phase. Zhang et al. [95] studied the laser welding-brazing of galvanized steel H220YD to aluminum alloy AA6016 using an Al-5Si interlayer. They reported the thickness of intermetallic ranging from 1.3µm to 13µm and composed of α(τ5)-Al8Fe2Si, θ-Al13Fe4, and ζ-Al2Fe phases. When the thickness of θ-Al13Fe4 and ζ-Al2Fe was higher than 10µm, the joint strength was significantly reduced. The effect of Si content on the reaction layer was studied by Xia et al. [96] in laser weldedbrazed 6061-T6 Al and DP590 steel using pure Al, Al-5Si, and Al-12Si. The addition of 5 wt.% Si reduced the thickness of η-Fe2(Al,Si)5 and θ-Fe(Al,Si)3 intermetallic layer owing to the reduction of elemental diffusion area. 12 wt.% Si altered the intermetallic components to η-Fe2Al5 and τ5-Al8Fe2Si and removed η-Fe2(Al,Si)5 (Fig. 27). The strength of joints produced with pure Al interlayer was lower than of Al-Si filler metal. Moreover, the addition of Si reduced the required laser power during laser welding/brazing process. The highest tensile strength (208 MPa) and ductility were attained with Al-5Si due to proper thickness (3.8-7.5 µm), components (η-Fe2(Al,Si)5 + θ-Fe(Al,Si)3), and the lower hardness of Si in intermetallics. This suggested that η-Fe2(Al,Si)5 had higher strength and ductility than θ-Fe(Al,Si)3 phase. Despite significant technological advances and extensive research on laser welding of aluminum to steel during the past four decades, it is still not widely applied mostly owing to insufficient mechanical properties. Progress has been made in optimizing the process parameters, methods, and the use of coating and interlayers. However, controlling the formation and distribution of intermetallic compounds is a major barrier to overcome. Other welds defects such as porosities and cracks need to be addressed as well.

The laser beam melted the aluminum at the top, which wetted the Cu surface thereby starting the diffusion process. They reported three different seam structures with varied process parameters as shown in Fig. 29. The low energy input led to the formation of voids and the "under-welded" joint. On the other hand, too much energy input melted the copper sheet and created an "over-welded" joint with voids inside solidified aluminum.

        <p>However, for aluminum at the bottom, Cu could easily sink into the aluminum. As fluid flow was different for both weld configurations, this influenced the formation of intermetallics. For aluminum at the top, the formation of around 5µm thickness AlCu2 was observed, close to the interface region. However, for aluminum at the bottom, a relatively large amount of CuAl2 and Cu9Al4 intermetallics were observed.

The presence of CuAl2, Cu9Al4, and CuAl intermetallics was observed inside the weld region for a welding speed of 10 m/min. However, at the higher welding speed of 50 m/min, the formation of intermetallics was suppressed. In addition, the tensile strength improved with increasing welding speed, reaching 160 MPa for aluminum at the top and 205 MPa for aluminum at the bottom, for the welding speed of 50 m/min.

In addition, the tensile strength improved with increasing welding speed, reaching 160 MPa for aluminum at the top and 205 MPa for aluminum at the bottom, for the welding speed of 50 m/min. In all samples, the fracture occurred in the intermetallic compound near the fusion zone interface. The fracture behavior and intermetallic formation in laser-welded samples of copper to aluminum were investigated by Zuo et al. [103].</p>
        <p>Fig. 32 shows the weld cross-section micrograph. Owing to the higher expansion coefficient of aluminum, an upward convexity of liquid aluminum was created. Since there is not sufficient time during solidification for the joint to get back to its original structure, the upward convexity resulted in a shallow weld pool and little mixing of two base metals. The four distinct zones that form the welding interlayer are shown in Fig. 33. Table 6 presents the composition and phase distribution of these ones. The first zone, adjacent to the Cu consisted of Cu9Al4 columnar grains. This was the thinnest and most uniform region. The second zone was a mixture of a net-like eutectic α-Al + θ-CuAl2 (gray area) and θ-CuAl2 (white area) structure. The concentration of CuAl2 was higher on the Cu side, however, when moved away the CuAl2 concentration decreased. Zone 3 contained the eutectic phase similar to zone 2, but finer in size and with an interlamellar spacing of less than 1 µm. In zone 4, the growth of the solidification front and the segregation of alloying elements created the dendrite microstructure. It was found that the presence of a thin, continuous, and uniform γ2-Cu9Al4 phase improved the shear strength. In contrast, the brittle θ-CuAl2 phase had a detrimental effect on the weld strength, and the fracture that occurred in this zone illustrated a weaker cohesion in the aluminum side.Fig. 32 shows the weld cross-section micrograph.

        <p>The application of sinusoidal beam oscillation was studied by Fetzer et al. [104] in overlap laser welding of oxygen-free copper and high-purity aluminum. By using suitable oscillation parameters, the weld composition could be managed. In the case of the smaller amplitude of 0.25 mm the weld composition was very inhomogeneous and large cracks were seen. However, the larger amplitude of 0.75 mm decreased the amount of copper in the weld zone and fused copper was also distributed more homogeneously. No cracks were seen in this case. Circular laser beam oscillation was applied by Dimatteo et al. [28] in laser welding of Al and Cu sheets. Low electrical contact resistance and good mechanical properties were achieved with double weld seams. Lerra et al. [105] focused on pulse shape and separation distance in Nd:YAG laser welding of Al and Cu. With the process optimization a low penetrating depth with a maximum tensile load of over 110 kgf was achieved. They also reported that preheating resulted in better mechanical properties and electrical resistance.The application of sinusoidal beam oscillation was studied by Fetzer et al.

        <p>A number of studies have been carried out to appropriately select a filler alloy to minimize defects and improve mechanical properties in the Al-Cu joint. The effect of tin interlayer in laser welding of Al 3003-H14 and Cu110-H00 was studied by Hailat et al. [106]. Fig. 34 shows the Al-Cu weld cross-section with and without tin interlayer. Large porosities can be seen in aluminum in the weld with Sn interlayer. However, the fracture occurred away from these porosities therefore they did not affect the joint strength. Welds with tin filler metal exhibited a better lap shear strength possibly due to the formation of Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn. Mys and Schmidt [107] declared that while Ni resulted in only a slight improvement in the tensile strength, Ag and Sn foils considerably improved the tensile strength. The samples welded without silver interlayer showed a very small recrystallization zone on the copper side following by hard and brittle Cu-Al intermetallics.A number of studies have been carried out to appropriately select a filler alloy to minimize defects and improve mechanical properties in the Al-Cu joint.

        <p>Similar results confirming the influence of Ag on the joint strength have been reported by Esser et al. [108]. The laser beam offset is recommended to restrict the growth of intermetallics in butt laser welding of aluminum and copper, quite similar to the proposed earlier for butt welding of steel to Cu. Mai and Spowage [45] investigated the laser welding of Cu and aluminum alloy AA4047 in the butt configuration. The laser beam offset of 0.2 mm towards aluminum produced crack-free welds with an elemental concentration of 48.4% Al, 24.3% Si, and 27.2% Cu. The weld nugget had a very high hardness compared to the parent materials that was attributed to the supersaturated solid solution or the formation of GP-zones. However, the increase in welding speed to more than 100 mm/min led to the solidification cracking at the weld joint. AlSi12 was used as filler materials for laser welding of pure aluminum and copper by Weigl and Schmidt [109]. Both AlSi12 and CuSi3 enhanced the ductility of the joints and reduced the absolute value and fluctuation of microhardness. However, the best results were achieved with AlSi12 owing to its higher percentage of Si. It reduced the viscosity and enhanced the turbulence of the molten metal thereby improving the element mixture in the weld zone.Similar results confirming the influence of Ag on the joint strength have been reported by Esser et al.

        <p>Similar to laser welding of steel and aluminum optimization of the welding parameters, and the use of coating and filler metals has been the subject of several investigations. However, the effect of many potential interlayers on the formation of new intermetallics needs further studies. Table 7 gives a summary of the research conducted on laser welding of aluminum and copper thus far. Laser welding is a robust and contact-free welding process with high control of energy deposition which provides a crucial way for joining temperature-sensitive and dissimilar material components such as battery cells in the EV battery system. Laser welding of dissimilar materials has continued to develop over the past two decades. However, despite several studies on different laser sources, optimization of process parameters, and various joint configurations, metallurgical defects such as incomplete bonding, brittle intermetallic phases, corrosion, excessive porosities, and cracking have persisted. These defects greatly undermine the mechanical and electrical performance of EV battery joints. Thus, further investigation is needed before laser welding can be widely used for EV battery manufacturing.Similar to laser welding of steel and aluminum optimization of the welding parameters, and the use of coating and filler metals has been the subject of several investigations.

They observed that elements were uniformly distributed in the weld pool which agreed well with calculated results. Porosity formation in laser welding of pure nickel and martensitic stainless steel was studied by Zhang et al. [111]. They concluded that shielding gas has no effect on porosity formation, but there was a direct relationship between the pulse width and porosity number. When the pulse width was less than 5 ms the porosity was completely suppressed resulting in a better joint. Li et al.

The cooling rate was highly dependent on the heat input affecting the grain dimension.Table 7 827 Summary of research conducted on laser beam welding of aluminum and copper. mass transfer to calculate weld geometry and element distribution in laser spot welding of 304 stainless steel and nickel.
