        <p>Near-infrared (NIR)-light-responsive materials such as organic agents and inorganic nanomaterials have received much attention in the field of cancer photothermal therapy (PTT) due to their minimal invasiveness and great penetration depth. [5][6][7][8][9][10] Particularly, Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) have emerged as the main mediators of PTT due to their small diameters, high light-to-heat conversion, and enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. [11] A multifunctional platform formed by Au nanoclusters (Au 25 ) with UCNPs@MS exhibited considerable PTT and PDT effect that further enhanced the tumor inhibition efficacies under 808 nm laser irradiation. [12] Furthermore, hairpin DNA functionalized UCNP@SiO 2 -Au NPs showed great potential for PTT and temperature-triggered drug delivery. [13] However, the traditional treatment by intravenous administration decreased the accumulation of the nanomaterials and weaken photothermal effect at the tumor site. [14] This thus leads to low effectiveness in eradicating tumors. [15] In addition, this strategy is prone to cause side effects on normal tissue sites. [16] Particularly, it has long-term treatment risks due to the nondegradable nanomaterials which cannot be excreted timely. [17,18] To overcome Surgical excision is one of the main treatments for malignant tumors. However, high risk of tumour recurrence is a major challenge. Near-infrared (NIR)light-induced tumor photothermal therapy has been studied, while its clinical applications are still restricted due to the limited therapeutic effects. To address this, here, a novel NIR-light-responsive and injectable DNA-mediated upconversion and Au nanoparticle hybrid (DNA-UCNP-Au) hydrogel is developed. Due to the confined and concentrated environment induced by the interaction between adjacent DNA strands and UCNP-Au NPs, an ultrastrong photothermal effect is observed. A photothermal efficiency as high as 42.7% is realized in the hydrogel, which is superior to pristine inorganic particles. Upon direct peritumoral injection of the hydrogel and with the treatment of 808 nm laser irradiation, tumors are eradicated and no recurrence is observed. Meanwhile, there are no side effects on normal tissues due to the local treatment. Taking advantage of the high phototherapeutic effect, biocompatibility, and flexible operability in this system, a novel approach for malignant tumor therapy is demonstrated.Near-infrared (NIR)-light-responsive materials such as organic agents and inorganic nanomaterials have received much attention in the field of cancer photothermal therapy (PTT) due to their minimal invasiveness and great penetration depth.

        <p>Herein, a novel NIR-light-responsive and injectable DNAinorganic hybrid hydrogel is developed by electrostatic complexation of DNA and upconversion lanthanide-Au hybrid nanoparticles (UCNP-Au NPs). Comparing to pristine inorganic nanomaterials, the DNA-UCNP-Au hydrogels have lower cytotoxicity, exhibiting a rather rapid heating rate under the same NIR irradiation. Due to the injectable property, the hydrogel can be precisely loaded around the tumor site by local treatment. It was found that the tumor tissue was eliminated by a single PTT, and the tumor's recurrence was effectively suppressed. No side effect on normal tissues was observed at the same time.Herein, a novel NIR-light-responsive and injectable DNAinorganic hybrid hydrogel is developed by electrostatic complexation of DNA and upconversion lanthanide-Au hybrid nanoparticles (UCNP-Au NPs).

        <p>First, the injectable DNA-inorganic hybrid hydrogel was prepared (Figure 1). In detail, the monodispersed NaYF 4 nanoparticles co-doped with Yb 3+ and Er 3+ were prepared by a solvent thermal method [19] and then used as the core to form hybrids with NaYF 4 :Nd. The NaYF 4 :Yb,Er@NaYF 4 :Nd (UCNP) were further converted into hydrophilic UCNP-PEI via a ligand exchange process using polyetherimide (PEI) as a surface coating agent to replace the original oleic acid ligands (Figure S1, Supporting Information). [20] Next, UCNP-Au NPs were then formed by the redox reaction between PEI and HAuCl 4 (Table S1 and Figures S2 andS3, Supporting Information). The UCNP-Au NPs displayed a distinctive hierarchical hybrid structure, in which the small Au NPs (≈1-2 nm) were decorated on the surface of UCNPs, and they exhibited a diameter of 32.4 ± 1.6 nm (Figure 2A and Figure S4, Supporting Information). Ultimately, the DNA-UCNP-Au hydrogels were prepared by electrostatic complexation of salmon sperm DNA (smDNA, 2000 bp) with cationic UCNP-Au NPs (Figure 2B and Figure S5, Supporting Information).First, the injectable DNA-inorganic hybrid hydrogel was prepared (Figure 1).

        <p>The addition of DNA led to a remarkable change in the topography of the as-obtained hydrogel, which showed a porous interconnected structure (Figure 2C and Figure S6, Supporting Information). This suggests that the DNA could facilitate the UCNP-Au NPs to form a confined and compact network by the electrostatic attraction. [21,22] The hydrogels displayed a maximum water content as high as 96 w%. Rheometry results indicate that the DNA-UCNP-Au hydrogel has low viscosity (Figure 2D), which makes it injectable by a syringe (Figure 2E and Figure S7, Supporting Information). A typical viscoelastic property [23] is evidenced by the larger storage moduli (G′) when compared to the loss moduli (G″) over the measured frequency range (0.1-100 Hz) (Figure 2F).The addition of DNA led to a remarkable change in the topography of the as-obtained hydrogel, which showed a porous interconnected structure (Figure 2C and Figure S6, Supporting Information).

        <p>Subsequently, photothermal performance of the DNA-UCNP-Au hydrogels was investigated. The UV-vis and fluorescence measurements (Figures S8 andS9, Supporting Information) indicated that efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer might occur due to the small distance between UCNP and Au NP under the irradiation of NIR laser. The UVvis-NIR spectra of UCNP-Au NPs showed a strong absorption at 540 nm, resulting from the plasma resonance absorption peak of isotropous Au NPs. When an 808 nm laser was used, it first stimulated the emission of UCNP at 540 nm. In this context, the ultra-small Au NPs acting as the energy acceptor further caused surface plasmon resonance phenomenon to achieve photothermal conversion, [24] which is in stark contrast to previously reported core-shell UCNP@SiO 2 -Au systems. [13] To study this effect, the DNA-UCNP-Au hydrogel with different concentrations of inorganic nanoparticles were investigated (Figure 3A). Under 808 nm laser irradiation (1 W cm -2 ), the Figure 1. Schematic illustration for the fabrication of injectable DNA-inorganic hybrid hydrogels (DNA-UCNP-Au). The hydrogels were prepared in three steps. UCNPs were first prepared by solvent thermal synthesis, forming the core@shell structure, followed by surface functionalization with PEI. The resulting UCNP@PEI was used to reduce HAuCl 4 to form UCNP-Au NPs. The cationic feature of UCNP-Au NPs endows them the ability to form DNA-UCNP-Au hydrogels by electrostatic complexation with salmon sperm DNA (smDNA). With near-infrared laser irradiation, the efficient photothermal conversion allows the fast temperature increase for tumor eradication.Subsequently, photothermal performance of the DNA-UCNP-Au hydrogels was investigated.

        <p>Adv. Mater. 2020, 32, 2004460 DNA-UCNP-Au hydrogel (0.2 w% UCNP-Au NPs) exhibited fast heating rate and in 30 s, it reached ≈55 °C. In 3 min, the hydrogel was up to ≈87 °C. Apparently, the higher concentration of UCNP-Au NPs (e.g., 0.4 w%) in the system resulted in faster heating and higher temperature (above 90 °C) in a very short time. In contrast, the pristine inorganic particles with the same concentration exhibited much less photothermal efficiency (Figure 3A and Figure S10, Supporting Information), which is also confirmed by the captured thermal images with appeared different contrasts (Figure 3B). In the DNA-UCNP-Au hydrogel, the photothermal conversion efficiency (η) was calculated to be 42.7%, which is much higher than that of the pristine UCNP-Au NPs (32.4%) (Figure S11, Supporting Information). Those results indicated the formed confined network of UCNP-Au NPs by the complexation with DNA plays an important role for the extraordinary photothermal effect, which is superior to traditional inorganic photothermal systems. [25][26][27][28] Moreover, in this hydrogel, there was negligible change in the photothermal effect after multiple cycles of laser irradiation, indicating the extraordinary photothermal stability of the soft material (Figure 3C).Adv.

        <p>Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of DNA-UCNP-Au hydrogel was investigated in a T24 bladder cancer cell line. The cell viability remained well by culturing with the DNA-mediated hydrogel (Figure S12, Supporting Information). This indicated that the cytotoxicity of UCNP-Au NPs was reduced significantly after electrostatic complexation with DNA. Notably, after NIR light irradiation just for 3 min, more than 70% of cancer cells were eradicated due to the outstanding photothermal effect. To investigate the photothermal efficiency in vivo, healthy nude mice were subcutaneously injected with PBS, UCNP-Au aqueous solution, and DNA-UCNP-Au hydrogel, respectively. By NIR irradiation in 3 min, discrepant temperature alternations (ΔT = 1.3, 21.1, 28.7 °C) were observed in the three samples (Figure S13, Supporting Information). The significant temperature change treated with the DNA-UCNP-Au hydrogel could be ascribed to the increased local concentration of nanoparticles in the hydrogel network, which is important to enhance the photothermal efficiency. The in vivo residence of the materials was further evaluated by a luminescence imaging technique. [29] As shown in Figure 3D, the emission of pristine UCNP-Au NPs decreased dramatically after subcutaneous injection for 12 h. However, the group treated with DNA-UCNP-Au hydrogel maintained stable emission even after 24 h, indicating that the DNA molecules play an important role in stabilizing the nanoparticles. In vivo stability of the hybrid hydrogels was also confirmed by dissection of the sampletreated mice (Figure S14, Supporting Information). In 2 days, the injected DNA-UCNP-Au hydrogel was kept intact, whereas the pristine UCNP-Au was decomposed in a few hours. Thus, the short-time mechanical stability is important for the realization of PTT treatment. The degradation after 3 days is also useful and important for the avoidance of side effects including toxicity. Thus, the outstanding photothermal efficiency, thermal stability, biosafety, and high photothermal temperature offer the DNA-mediated hybrid hydrogel as a promising PTT agent.Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of DNA-UCNP-Au hydrogel was investigated in a T24 bladder cancer cell line.

        <p>To investigate the PTT effect in vivo, female BALB/c nude mice bearing T24 tumors with a volume of about 100 mm 3 on the right back of hind leg region were used. Three samples including the DNA-UCNP-Au hydrogel (0.2 w% UCNP-Au), 0.2 w% UCNP-Au aqueous solution, and PBS as a control were subcutaneously (s.c.) injected around the tumors or intravenously (i.v.) injected via caudal vein. After NIR irradiation, there was a period of 21 days for the observation of the mice tumor variation (Figure 4A). No obvious bodyweight alternation was observed in all groups (Figure S15, Supporting Information), indicating the nontoxic nature of the samples. The laser with 808 nm NIR irradiation was introduced, which has a strong penetration and lower side effects regarding thermal injuries to normal tissues in vivo. [30] Remarkably, with the treatment by DNA-UCNP-Au hydrogel, significant suppression of tumor growth and no recurrence was observed in the observation period of 21 days (Figures 4B,C andFigures S16-S18, Supporting Information). In this process, the local temperature of mice tumor treated with the hydrogel raised to 62.2 °C within 3 min upon NIR irradiation. This temperature was high enough to eliminate cancer cells by melting the membrane of cancer cells instantaneously and getting the protein denatured. Meanwhile, the high temperature made the tumor's nourishing blood vessels spasm, forming intravascular thrombosis, causing further cell apoptosis and tumor tissue necrosis. [31][32] Besides, the migration of macrophage caused by the inflammatory factors subsequently cleared the cancer cell fragments (Figure 4D). The proposed PTT mechanism is illustrated in Figure 4E.To investigate the PTT effect in vivo, female BALB/c nude mice bearing T24 tumors with a volume of about 100 mm 3 on the right back of hind leg region were used.

        <p>Moreover, the hematoxylin and eosin staining results indicated that the DNA-UCNP-Au hydrogel and its PTT therapy had no side effects on normal tissues and organs (Figure S19, Supporting Information). Regarding the s.c. treatment by UCNP-Au nanoparticles, despite the temperature being up to 56.8 °C with irradiation for 3 min, the tumors could not be eliminated and some recurrence occurred (Figures 4B,C and Figure S18, Supporting Information). This might be due to the inhomogeneous distribution of heat in the absence of a confined environment of the nanoparticles. Furthermore, in this temperature, the heat shock protein (HSP) might alleviate the thermal damage to tumor cells. [33] Additionally, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) also contributed to the extraordinary therapeutic effect (Figures S20-S22, Supporting Information). [34][35][36][37] All the results demonstrate that the injectable DNA-UCNP-Au hydrogel is a promising therapy agent for future malignant tumors' non-surgical treatment. Moreover, the tattoo models in mice were established to further explore the photothermal effects on tattoo removal. We observed that the thermal energy from the irradiated DNA-UCNP-Au hydrogel is important to accelerate the decomposition of the ink dye in tattoo (Figure S23, Supporting Information). Therefore, our system offers new opportunities for solid tumors and tattoo treatments.Moreover, the hematoxylin and eosin staining results indicated that the DNA-UCNP-Au hydrogel and its PTT therapy had no side effects on normal tissues and organs (Figure S19, Supporting Information).

        <p>In summary, a novel class of injectable DNA-mediated upconversion nanoparticles-Au hydrogel with extraordinary PTT function has been developed.
