        <p>The development of metal complexes for optoelectronic applications is a fertile area of research. In contrast to the rigorous development of mononuclear metal complexes, dinuclear species have been less well studied and their fundamental chemistry and applications are under-explored. However, dinuclear species present special properties and functions compared with mononuclear species as a consequence of tuning the bridging ligands, the cyclometalated ligands or the two metal centers. More recently, dinuclear species have enabled important breakthroughs in the fields of OLEDs, photocatalytic water splitting and CO 2 reduction, DSPEC, chemosensors, biosensors, PDT, smart materials and so on. Here we present an overview of recent developments of dinuclear metal complexes, their multifunctional properties and their various applications. The relationship between structure and property of dinuclear species and important factors which influence device performance are discussed. Finally, we illustrate some challenges and opportunities for future research into dinuclear metal complexes. This review aims to provide an up-to-date summary and outlook of functional dinuclear metal complexes and to stimulate more researchers to contribute to this exciting interdisciplinary field.The development of metal complexes for optoelectronic applications is a fertile area of research.

        <p>The continued development of organometallic complexes is a very important and intriguing topic due to their established applications in optoelectronic devices such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), [1][2][3][4][5][6] light-emitting electrochemical cells (LEECs), [7][8][9][10][11][12] electrochemical luminescence (ECL), [13][14][15][16][17][18] chemosensors, [19][20][21][22][23] biosensors, [24][25][26][27][28] and photodynamic therapy (PDT), [29][30][31][32][33] as well as emerging areas including photocatalytic water splitting and CO 2 reduction, [34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44] dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthesis cells (DSPEC), [45][46][47][48][49] and smart materials. [50][51][52][53][54] Compared with the rigorous development of mononuclear metal complexes, dinuclear metal complexes have been less well studied and in many ways are in their infancy. The major challenges are as follows: (i) Obtaining dinuclear complexes can require complicated synthetic processes that give low production yields. [55][56][57] (ii) Dinuclear complexes are often obtained as a mixture of diastereomers which are very difficult to separate. [58][59][60][61][62] (iii) Complicated inter-and intra-molecular electron and energy transfer processes can make their properties hard to predict. [63][64][65][66][67] (iv) Dinuclear complexes often feature poor optical properties with low photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and short excited state lifetimes due to the large contribution of non-radiative excited states from the bridging ligands. 59,[68][69][70][71] (v) Stable true-blue phosphors, especially blue electroluminescene (EL), is still difficult to obtain in dinuclear systems due to the more conjugated structure compared with their mononuclear analogues. 72 (vi) Dinuclear complexes have relatively large molecular weights so they generally cannot be thermally evaporated to form thin films when making optoelectronic devices, requiring solution processing instead. [73][74][75][76][77] Therefore, it is not surprising that dinuclear systems have attracted less attention than mononuclear counterparts. Nonethless, important progress has been made with dinuclear metal complexes in optoelectronic applications, as summarised in Fig. 1.

        <p>Several important questions immediately arise when considering dinuclear systems and their optoelectronic properties, such as: i) Diastereoisomers or geometrical isomers usually exist in the dinuclear systems: is there any tendency for one isomer to predominate over others? What is the structure-property relationship within such isomer systems? Can these isomers be separated? ii) What are the mechanisms of electron/energy transfer in the dinuclear systems? iii) What is the influence on the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) when another metal atom is introduced in the same molecule? iv) When combining two individual metal components in one molecule, are the properties essentially a summation of those of the individual components, or are they very different? In this section, questions i) and ii) will be discussed in detail based on recent progress in dinuclear metal complexes. Questions iii) and iv) will be discussed in the next section.

        <p>Diastereomers mixtures of meso (ΛΔ) and rac (ΔΔ/ΛΛ) isomers are usually present in dinuclear metal systems due to the chiral nature of the metal centers. The most fundamental example of the genre is [M(CL) 2 ] 2 (BL), where CL is a cyclometallated ligand such as bidentate 2-phenylpyridine (ppy), and BL is a symmetrical bridging ligand including a flexible bis-atoms bridge and a rigid aromatic bridge (Fig. 2). The separation of diastereomers is crucial for understanding their detailed structure-property relationships and for further applications. However, until now, only a few cases have been reported of complete separation of diastereomers. 85,[91][92][93][94][95][96] Hua and von Zelewsky first reported a successful way for the selective preparation of isomerically pure dinuclear complexes by using an enantiomerically pure chiral building block for Ru complexes. 91 Keene et al. developed chromatographic methods for separation of Ru enantiomers by ion-exchange chromatography, using chiral eluents. 92 Ye et al. have recently developed a useful tactic for avoiding the formation of diastereomeric mixtures via a chiral precursor strategy using Lor D-proline as an auxiliary ligand. 95 The direct synthetic routes for pure enantiomers, ΛΛ and ΔΔ, are shown in Fig. 3. This strategy has also been applied to the larger enantiopure multimetallic Ir(III) systems. 97,98 Until recently, the separation of diiridium diastereomers was achieved by facile fractional crystallization, silica column chromatography without chiral eluents, or a combination of the two techniques. 94,96 The ratios of diiridium diastereomers are still hard to predict: for example, the meso-isomer is usually favoured over the rac-isomer in a diiridium system with diarylhydrazide bridging ligands. However, opposite results were obtained from the parent diiridium dimers [Ir(ppy) 2 (µ-Cl) 2 ] 2 , where the ratio of rac-isomer is higher than meso-isomer. 99,100 These different results are probably induced by the interligand steric interactions.Diastereomers mixtures of meso (ΛΔ) and rac (ΔΔ/ΛΛ) isomers are usually present in dinuclear metal systems due to the chiral nature of the metal centers.

        <p>Please do not adjust margins Fig. 3 The synthetic routes for enantiomers 1, ΛΛ and 2, ΔΔ. 95 Meso (ΛΔ) and rac (ΔΔ/ΛΛ) isomers often exhibit distinguishing photophysical properties due to their different molecular conformations. For example, Williams and Lincoln et al. had successfully reported a series of dinuclear Ru(II) complexes isomers via a chiral precursor strategy. The photoluminescent properties of these complexes upon binding to DNA has been studied. [101][102][103][104][105][106][107][108] In aqueous solution, the luminescence of dinuclear Ru(II) complex 3 ([µ- (11,11"-bidppz)(phen) 4 Ru 2 ] 4+ ; phen = 1,10-phenanthroline, 11,11"-bidppz = 11,11"-bi(dipyrido[3,2-a:2",3"-c]phenazinyl)) is essentially quenched at ambient temperatures, probably by protonation of the phenazine nitrogen by water. 101 However, a dramatic increase in luminescence intensity, referred to as the "light-switch" effect, with higher quantum yield was observed when complex 3 is bound to poly(dA-dT) 2 . 102,103,105 The quantum yield for rac-ΔΔ was measured to be 9%, which is approximately 7-8 times higher than that found for the meso-ΛΔ and rac-ΛΛ isomers with 1.3% and 1.1%, respectively. This suggests that the nitrogens of the bidppz ligand of the ΔΔ isomer may be shielded from protonation. 103 A similar variation in quantum yields was also observed for Δcompared to Λ-[Ru(phen) 2 (dppz)] 2+ due to a difference in location of the DPPZ ligand within the intercalation pocket. Interactions between closely bound complex ions may also play a role. 106 The final binding geometry studies of the three stereoisomers of complex 3 in poly(dA-dT) 2 suggested that the bidppz ligand is intercalated between the nucleobases in an anti conformation, with a small rotation around the central pivot bond. The complex intercalates asymmetrically, with one of the Ru(phen) 2 moieties deeply intercalated from the minor groove side. 103,105 Fig. 4 The chemical structure of complex 3.Please do not adjust margins Fig. 3 The synthetic routes for enantiomers 1, ΛΛ and 2, ΔΔ. 95 Meso (ΛΔ) and rac (ΔΔ/ΛΛ) isomers often exhibit distinguishing photophysical properties due to their different molecular conformations.

        <p>Cis-trans isomerism, also known as geometric isomerism or configurational isomerism, is a standard term in organic chemistry. For dinuclear complexes, cis indicates that the functional groups are on the same side of the two metal centers while trans conveys that they are on opposing sides (Fig. 5). Recently, we reported a series of aggregation induced phosphorescent emission (AIPE)-active dinuclear Ir(III) system with Schiff base bridging ligands, and their applications in anion detection, chemo/bio-sensors and information storage (Fig. 6). 50,85,[109][110][111] For ionic dinuclear Ir(III) complexes, cis-trans isomeric mixtures were found in the complexes 4, 5, 7 and 9 with phenyl in the bridging ligands. However, cis-trans isomerization was not observed in the complexes 6, 8 and 10 with biphenyl in the bridging ligands. Indeed many studies had pointed out that the isomeric mixtures could be predicted by the conjugated bridging chain length in the dinuclear systems. A short conjugated bridging ligand could induce isomeric mixtures, [112][113][114][115] but this is not the case with a longer conjugated bridging ligand. 68,[116][117][118] Our work revealed no cis-trans mixtures in the neutral dinuclear Ir(III) complexes 11 and 12 with short conjugated bridging ligands; only the stable trans isomer was observed. 109,110 Therefore, it seems that cis-trans isomerization is induced not only by the length of conjugated bridging chains, but also by a counter ion effect.Cis-trans isomerism, also known as geometric isomerism or configurational isomerism, is a standard term in organic chemistry.

        <p>The cis-trans isomers in the complex 4 with ClO 4 -counter ions were separated by fractional crystallization and their crystal structures were obtained (Fig. 6). The ratio of cis-trans isomers in 4 was calculated as 2.58/1, which is higher than in the analogous complex 5 with PF 6 -counter ions. This result reveals that the isomer ratios are induced by the counter ions, and can be tuned by the counter ion exchange process.

        <p>Photoinduced electron and energy transfer processes commonly occur in dinuclear metal systems, such as Ru(II)-Rh(III), 120,121 Ru(II)-Os(II), [122][123][124][125][126][127][128] Ru(II)-Ni(II), 129 Ru(II)-Zn(II), 130 Ru(II)-Cu(II), 131 Ru(II)-Ru(II), 64,67 Ir(III)-Ru(II), 125,132,133 Ir(III)-Pt(II), 129 Ir(III)-Eu(III), 134 Ir(III)-Ir(III) 56 . Therefore, bimetallic complexes are popular choices as donor-bridge-acceptor (D-B-A) systems for investigations of photoinduced electron and energy transfer process. As shown in Fig. 7, the electron transfer usually occurs via two fundamentally different mechanisms: the coherent tunneling or incoherent hopping mechanism. 65,135 The tunneling mechanism is often described by the superexchange model, 136 which requires the donor and acceptor at either ends of the bridge to be energetically well separated from the bridge states. In this situation the bridge is neither reduced nor oxidized but merely functions as a coupling medium for the transfer process. In contrast, the incoherent hopping mechanism involves real intermediate states that actively transport the electron or hole along the bridge. For energy transfer, through-space (Förster) or through-bond (Dexter) are the two main mechanisms (Fig. 8). 137 Thus, understanding the mechanism of photoinduced electron and energy transfer is crucial for further design of functional dinuclear metal complexes and their applications in optoelectronic devices.

        <p>In early work on electron and energy transfer, a Ru(II)-Rh(III) system was first studied by Scandola and coworkers. 120 The hetero-dinuclear complex 13 consists of two structurally similar components, namely, metal tris(po1ypyridine) complexes, linked by a flexible ethylene chain (Fig. 9). The Ru(II) component acts as the donor (D), and the Rh(III) component unit as the acceptor (A). A wide range of techniques such as picosecond laser spectroscopy, nanosecond single-photon counting (emission lifetimes), Raman spectroscopy and transient absorption measurements were applied to investigate the mechanism of electron and energy transfer between the two metal components. The cyclic voltammogram of 13 showed a Ru(II)/(III) oxidation potential at 1.13 V vs SCE, Rh(III)/(II) reduction potential at -0.92 V and two ligand-ligand" reduction potentials at -1.45 V and -1.66 V, respectively, which showed a superposition of the corresponding curves of the single Ru(II) component and the Rh(III) component. This result indicated that the interaction between the two polypyridyl centers is insignificant, thus metal-metal interaction takes place via a hole transfer through-bond superexchange process in the ground state (Fig. 10b). 138 The UV-vis absorption spectrum of 13 is an exact superposition of the spectra of the isolated mononuclear species, without a new band arising.

The strap is intended to function as a ratchet giving access to a wide range of dihedral angles while keeping a fixed D-A distance. Triplet energy transfer rates were measured in a low temperature organic glass matrix to prevent any undesirable rotation from occurring. The results displayed a pronounced conformational dependence of the transfer rates between phenylene rings held at 0º and 90º. The electronic coupling was largest when the phenyl units were close to coplanar (υ = 30º). By contrast, at the largest dihedral angle (υ = 90º) the electronic coupling decreased drastically, resulting in a transfer rate that decreased by a factor of 80. In conclusion, these representative examples have illustrated the role played by the bridge, metal centers and peripheral ligands in the photoinduced electron and energy transfer processes. It has been shown that the electron and energy transfer is stongly influenced by the triplet excited state energy of the individual components, the length of the bridge and the conformation of the bridge. However, it is still difficult to predict the charge transfer mechanism in a polynulcear complex based on current knowledge. For example, a hopping mechanism was confirmed in the Ir-Ru system, rather than a superexchange mechanism in the Ru-Os system which possesses the same bridging ligands. 127,133 Careful design of molecular structure can afford precise control of distance, energy gap and conformational effects which can promote future investigations of the photoinduced electron and energy transfer processes and the development of molecular-based devices. 65How the torsion angle affects the extent of long-range electronic coupling in D-B-A systems was first studied by Harriman and co-workers. 139 As shown in Fig. 20, the complexes 38-41 are linked by an ethynylene-substituted biphenyl bridge that incorporates a constraining tether.

        <p>Since Thompson and coworkers reported the first phosphorescent OLEDs (PHOLEDs) in 1998, 3 electroluminescent materials have mainly focused on transition metal complexes, especially iridium complexes, which utilize singlet and triplet excitons to realize nearly 100% internal quantum efficiency (IQE) in the device. 9,[162][163][164][165] In contrast to PHOLEDs, thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials have recently emerged as new generation organo-electroluminescent materials for exciton harvesting in OLEDs.

        <p>Since the seminal work by Watts and Güdel in the 1980s, 177 phosphorescent cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes have attracted great interest due to their wide applications especially in the field of organo-electroluminescence. This is due to their extraordinary properties, namely: high phosphorescence quantum yields at room temperature from triplet metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) states, suitable triplet state lifetime (in the order of µs), high thermal and photochemical stability for fabrication by vacuum deposition techniques, and a broad range of emission colors which can be tuned by modifying the structure of the ligands. [178][179][180] Since Forrest and coworkers reported the first PHOLEDs based on an Ir(III) complex emitter in 1999, 181 mononuclear Ir(III) complexes have received most attention due to their ease of synthesis and tuning of emission across the entire visible spectrum. Their structure-property relationships are now well understood. 5,10,182,183 In contrast to the rigorous development of mononuclear iridium complexes, the fundamental chemistry and applications of dinuclear iridium complexes are under-developed. However, the dinuclear complexes invariably present special photophysical properties and functions compared with mononuclear species through tuning the bridging ligands and the cyclometalated ligands. For example, in the solid state, highly efficient emission, with aggregation-induced emission and mechanochromic luminescence properties, can be simultaneously realized in a dinuclear iridium system via selection of a flexible Schiff base bridging ligand. 50,109,110 Furthermore, single-molecule white-light emission has been realized in a dinuclear iridium polymer through selection of two individual emitting color Ir(III) cores with a bulky conjugated bridging ligand. 184 Therefore, it is of great significance to develop novel dinuclear iridium complexes..Since the seminal work by Watts and Güdel in the 1980s, 177 phosphorescent cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes have attracted great interest due to their wide applications especially in the field of organo-electroluminescence.

        <p>Obtaining a true-blue phosphor based on dinuclear Ir(III) complexes is still a huge challenge. A series of dinuclear Ir(III) complexes with sky-blue or green emission is shown in Fig. 23.

        <p>Among these dinuclear Ir(III) complexes, N^O-type bridged derivatives commonly show bright green or sky-blue emission. In 2011, two neutral dinuclear Ir(III) complexes 42 and 43, bridged by the versatile dianionic terpyridine dicarboxylate ligand were reported by Mazzanti and coworkers. 59 Both the solution 1 H NMR spectra and DFT calculations revealed that ΛΛ and ΛΛ enantiomers co-exist in both complexes 43 and 43, whereas the meso form was not observed, which may be attributed to the interligand steric interactions. The UV absorption spectra of both complexes showed an intense absorption around 260 nm which was attributed to the spin-allowed ligand-centered ( 1 LC) transtions, whereas the weak absorption at &gt; 400 nm was attributed to the singlet metal to ligand charge transfer ( 1 MLCT) transitions. The absorption tail between 400-500 nm arises from the formally spin-forbidden 3 MLCT transitions. Overall, both 42 and 43 showed absorption features that are similar to their analogous mononuclear species, which indicates a negligible contribution of the bridging ligand in the absorption process. Complexes 42 and 43 showed bright green or blue-green emission at room temperature with maximum emission wavelength at 538 and 477 nm, respectively. The photoluminescent quantum yields (PLQYs) of 42 and 43 are Φ 17.7% and 4.8%, respectively. The excited state lifetimes of 42 and 43 are 0.09 and 0.15 µs, respectively, which indicated the emission of both complexes is from 3 MLCT states. The significant blue-shift of 43 compared to 42 can be attributed to the introduction of the F-substituents, which increases the HOMO-LUMO energy gap by lowering the energy level of the HOMO.Among these dinuclear Ir(III) complexes, N^O-type bridged derivatives commonly show bright green or sky-blue emission.

        <p>In 2011, Hajra et al. reported a new dinuclear Ir(III) complex 44 containing a pyrazine dicarboxylate bridging ligand. 58 44 showed bright green emission (PLQY = 38%) in dichloromethane solution at room temperature with maximum emission wavelength at 500 nm. DFT calculations showed that the HOMO of 44 is mainly centered on the cyclometallated ligands and metal d orbitals, whereas the LUMO is mainly centered on the bridging ligand.

In the emission spectrum of 45 two peaks were observed at room temperature: the main emission peak at 523 nm can be attributed to the 3 MLCT, whereas the shoulder peak at around 560 nm can be attributed to the 3 LC. This structureless emission is more obvious at 77 K. The PLQY of 45 is as high as 60%, suggesting that this kind of dinuclear Ir(III) complex could be used in future optoelectronic devices.In 2013, Sünkel et al. reported a new dinuclear Ir(III) complex 45, bridged by an oxamidato ligand. 61 The crystal structure analysis revealed only the meso diastereoisomer (ΛΔ), which is in contrast to most reported crystal structures of chloride-or methoxide-bridged dinuclear Ir(III) complexes where the enantiomeric pair (ΛΛ and ΔΔ) is observed.

        <p>Subsequently, M"hamedi et al. reported two new dinuclear Ir(III) complexes 46 and 47 with oxamidato-type bridging ligands and investigated their electroluminescent properties in OLEDs. 185 The 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra of 46 and 47 revealed that both the meso and racemic forms (two enantiomers, ΛΛ and ΔΔ) as a diastereomeric mixture (ratio = 3:2) exist in both complexes. Whereas the µ-dichloro-bridged precursor of 46 and 47, showed only faint emission in solution, 46 and 47 are highly emissive (Φ PL 73% and 63%) with short excited state lifetimes of τ p 0.84 and 1.16 µs, respectively. Inspired by the superior photoluminescent properties, the electroluminescent properties of 46 and 47 were investigated. The PHOLED structures and energy levels of component materials are shown in Fig. 24. PEDOT:PSS is a hole-transport layer, poly(vinylcarbazole) (PVK) is the host material, OXD-7 and TPBi are electron transporting materials to optimize charge balance and confine excitons in the emitter layer. The electroluminescent performance is shown in Fig. 24 and Table 2. Very bright green electroluminescence was observed for both 46 (533 nm) and 47 (533 nm) with L max &gt; 25000 cd/m 2 which is among the brightest PHOLEDs fabricated using dinuclear Ir(III) complexes. The maximum EQEs of 46 and 47 are 2.95% and 3.46%, respectively. In 2013, Graf et al. reported a new dinuclear complex 48 with an unprecedented N,N":O,O"-type bridging ligand. 186 The X-ray crystal structure revealed two N donor atoms coordinated with one iridium center in a four-membered chelate ring, whereas two O donor atoms coordinated with the other iridium center in a six-membered chelate ring. At room temperature, complex 48 exhibits bright green emission in both solution state and doped into poly(methy methacrylate) (PMMA) (Φ PL 27% and 55%) with short excited lifetimes (0.7 µs and 1.5 µs) respectively..

        <p>In 2014, Zheng et al. reported three new dinuclear Ir(III) complexes 49-51, bridged by diarylhydrazide ligands. 96 Similar to the previously reported dinuclear Ir(III) complexes, the meso (ΛΔ/ΔΛ) and rac (ΛΛ/ΔΔ) diastereomeric mixtures were found in this system. The diastereomers were readily separated by using their different solubilities to give pure 49 (ΛΔ/ΔΛ, 41% yield) and 50 (ΛΛ/ΔΔ, 30% yield). Both complexes 49 and 50 showed very bright green emission at room temperature with a peak at 521 nm and 523 nm, respectively, high PLQYs of 71% and 88%, and short excited lifetimes (1.45 µs and 1.44 µs) respectively. Solution-processed OLEDs were fabricated in the simple architecture ITO/ PEDOT : PSS (50 nm)/ PVK : PBD (40%) : Ir complex (5%) (90 nm)/ Ba (4 nm)/Al (100 nm). (PBD is an electron-transport material). The electroluminescent performance of complexes 49 and 50 is shown in Fig. 25 and Table 2. The parent Ir(III) dimers [Ir 2 (ppy) 4 Cl 2 ] and [Ir 2 (flpy) 4 Cl 2 ] were selected for comparison. Both complexes 49 and 50 showed obviously better electroluminescent properties than their parent Ir(III) dimers. The best device performance was for 50 with peak CE, PE and EQE of 37 cd A -1 , 14 lm W -1 and 11%, respectively. These superior data compared to 49 were attributed to the better solubility of 50 than 49. It is worth noting that the electroluminescent performance of 49 and 50 is higher than the benchmark PHOLED based on the monuclear green [Ir(ppy) 3 ] complex, using a solution processed emitter layer. This work proved that dinuclear Ir(III) complexes are a viable strategy to obtain highly efficient OLEDs. Recently, a follow-up study on complexes 52-59 examined the effects of substitution on the bridging and cyclometalating ligands. 94 The diastereomers which formed in all these complexes were cleanly separated due to their different solubilities. Thus, their photophysical properties were investigated individually. Complexes 52-55 are almost non-emissive in both the solution state and in PMMA films at room temperature. However, the emission of both complexes can be detected at 77 K, thus the behaviour at room temperature can be explained by considering thermal population of low-lying non-emissive MC excited states. 187 Complexes 56-59 showed faint emission in the solution state, which was attributed to the non-radiative quenching through motion of the bridging unit. By contrast, they showed bright green emission with a peak at 493-515 nm, and PLQYs of 42%-68% in the PMMA state.

        <p>More recently, Congrave et al. developed a new series of diarylhydrazide-bridged diiridium complexes 60-68 188 that showed highly efficient emission in the both solution and doped film states, high k r , relatively short τ p and in some cases notably sharp emission. Especially, complexes 66-68 exhibit sky-blue emission which is rare for diiridium complexes. A combination of X-ray molecular structures and computational studies revealed that the strong intramolecular π-π interactions (Fig. 26) between bridging ligand and cyclometalated ligand play a vital role in the observed excellent photophysical properties of the complexes. Furthermore, it was evident that the intramolecular π-π interactions are promoted by the introduction of fluorine substituents onto the phenyl rings of the bridging ligand.

        <p>In 2015, Sánchez and coworkers reported a series of dinuclear Ir(III) complexes 70-74 with doubly alkynyl bridging ligands. 189 The structural characterization revealed that unique diastereoisomers (ΛΛ/ΔΔ) were observed in complexes 70-72 and 74, whereas two diastereoisomer (ΔΛ and ΛΛ/ΔΔ) mixtures were obtained in 73. All the complexes 70-74 were non-emissive in the solid state which can be attributed to the typical aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ), whereas they showed relatively stronger emission in the 505-515 nm region in degassed solutions. The PLQYs were in the range of 0.7 to 2.4%, which are higher than the parent chloride-bridged dimer due to the introduction of the strong-field alkynyl group. The low quantum yields for 70-74 in solution can be attributed to the relatively fast σ/π alkynyl exchange between the Ir centers which could favor an efficient radiationless decay pathway.In 2015, Sánchez and coworkers reported a series of dinuclear Ir(III) complexes 70-74 with doubly alkynyl bridging ligands. 189 The structural characterization revealed that unique diastereoisomers (ΛΛ/ΔΔ) were observed in complexes 70-72 and 74, whereas two diastereoisomer (ΔΛ and ΛΛ/ΔΔ) mixtures were obtained in 73.

In 2016, Ye et al. developed a useful tactic for avoiding the formation of diastereomeric mixtures in dinuclear Ir(III) complex via a chiral precursor strategy, using L-or D-proline as an auxiliary ligand. 95 Thus, the enantiomers 1 (ΛΛ) and 2 (ΔΔ) with a dipyrimidine bridging ligand were synthesized separately. The emission spectra of 1 and 2 were similar: both complexes showed structured blue emission with a peak at 436 nm and a shoulder at 465 nm in DCM solution. These two dinuclear complexes show the bluest emission of dinuclear Ir(III) complexes reported to date. Recently a milestone study on a series of diiridium complexes 80-83 bearing novel 2-pyrazolyl-6-phenyl pyridine chelate and bidentate phenyl imidazolylidene chelate ligands was reported by Chi and co-workers. 78 All these complexes exhibited highly stable and efficient emission with near-unity PLQYs in both the solution and solid film states. In stark contrast to most of the previously reported solution-processed OLEDs based on diiridium complexes, the good volatility of complexes 80-83, enabled their OLEDs to be fabricated by vacuum evaporation. The devices showed impressive performance (Fig. 28), especially the green emissive complex 81 gave a record high EQE for a diiridium complex of 27.6%. This value is also comparable to the top-tier green OLEDs using mononuclear Ir(III) dopants. However, further optimization of the device structures to avoid obvious roll-off at high luminance is desirable.A one-electron reduced species located on the diimine-based bridging ligand was observed in 78 as revealed by the presence of two reversible reductions. No interaction was found in 79 where the electronic conduit is interupted by the ethylene spacer in the bridging ligand. The emission spectra of 75-79 in acetonitrile are shown in Fig. 27.

The PLQYs of 85-87 are in the range of 21%-41%, whereas the lower luminescence of 88 and 89 may be due to the different electronic structure induced by the position of the substituent group on the pyridine ligands (4-substitution in 88 and 89). Devices were fabricated in the simple structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PVK-PBD (40%)-complex (5%)/Ba/Al. The detailed photophysical and device performance data are shown in Table 3. The device based on complex 85 showed yellow electrophosphorescence with a maximum brightness of ~2200 cd/m 2 and EQE of 4%.

        <p>Please do not adjust margins In 2015, four new luminescent chloro-bridged Ir(III) dimers 93-96 were reported by Zysman-Colman and coworkers. 76 Their photophysical properties were investigated in detail. The key findings were: i) Compared to the parent dimer 84, a red-shift in emission for all complexes within the range of 563-611 nm can be attributed to the introduction of formyl groups into the structures. ii) A gradual increase of PLQY was observed as the numbers of formyl groups increased. This can be attributed to the more extensive hydrogen bonding interactions, which resulted in a large decrease in k nr .

The poor device performances based on 93 and 95 dopants were suggested to originate from either incomplete host-to-guest energy transfer (93) or exciplex emission (95) (Fig. 31). For 94 and 96 the emission was nearly independent of the current density, demonstrating highly efficient host-to-guest energy transfer and no significant exciplex contribution.

For example, complex 98 showed two consecutive one-electron oxidation waves with the oxidation peaks at 0.62 and 0.95 V (Fig. 32), whereas no reduction process was observed. The two oxidation processes can be assigned to the stepwise oxidation of the two Ir(III) centers, i.e., Ir(III)-Ir(III)/Ir(III)-Ir(IV) and Ir(III)-Ir(IV)/Ir(IV)-Ir(IV) couples. The presence of two sequential redox waves clearly indicates electronic coupling between the two Ir centers which are effectively mediated by the hydroxyl bridge, supported by the DFT and TDDFT calculations.

All the complexes showed intense emission in the green-yellow to orange regions in DCM solution at room temperature. The PLQYs of all the complexes are ca. 50% which is even higher than typical Ir(III)-acac complexes with simple ppy ligands. Interestingly, complexes 102, 104, 105 and 106 (Table 4) are mesomorphic liquid-crystalline materials, showing a columnar hexagonal mesophase (Fig. 33), whereas 101 is not mesomorphic due to the low coverage of the dimer periphery by alkoxy chains. Furthermore, the morphology is a delicate function of the substitution position of the chains as 103 is not mesomorphic, wheras 104 is mesomorphic. In 2010, a new neutral dinuclear Ir(III) complex 107 with a bis(β-diketonato) bridging ligand was reported by Do"s group. 118 107 showed a weak emission band at 615 nm with low quantum efficiency (Φ PL = 2.3%) in degassed CHCl 3 solution, whereas bright orange emission with  max at 597 nm was observed in the solid state. This indicates that 107 may be aggregation-induced emission (AIE) active.

The mononuclear species [Ir(ppy) 2 bpy] which was studied for comparison (Fig. 34), gave an intense absorption band in the 400-550 nm region, with a weaker band at 650-800 nm. Such bands can be attributed to the population of the 3 MLCT state and showed a lifetime around 60 ns. However, for dinuclear complex 110, a wide band that covered the entire 400-850 nm region was observed which can be assigned to the Ph 4 substituted bpy.

PHOLEDs showed a low efficiency with maximum CE and EQE values for 110 of 0.23 cd A -1 and 0.1%, respectively. 197 The introduction of F atoms into the cyclometalating ligands induces a blue-shift in the emission with a peak at 546 nm for complex 111 compared to complexes 109 and 110. 56 Similar transient absorption spectra of 111 to the complexes 109 and Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins 110 again suggested that the emission is from mixed 3 LC and 3 MLCT excited states.

        <p>In 2015, we developed a series of cationic dinuclear Ir(III) complexes 4-8, featuring versatile Schiff base bridging ligands. 50,85 They all showed faint emission in the solution state, whereas bright orange phosphorescence was observed in the aggregated state demonstrating classical AIPE behaviour. Furthermore, due to the good flexibility of the Schiff base bridging ligands, the molecular arrangements are relatively loose and can be easily destroyed by the force of manual grinding in a mortar and pestle, resulting in mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) with a change from orange to red emission clearly observed. Upon organic vapour treatment, or heating of the ground samples, the emission color reverted to the original orange, revealing reversible MCL. In summary, the flexible Schiff base bridging ligand plays an important role in achieving AIPE and MCL simultaneously. Benefiting from these combined properties, a perchlorate anion phosphorescent sensor and a phosphorescence re-writable data recording device were successfully fabricated.In 2015, we developed a series of cationic dinuclear Ir(III) complexes 4-8, featuring versatile Schiff base bridging ligands. 50,85 They all showed faint emission in the solution state, whereas bright orange phosphorescence was observed in the aggregated state demonstrating classical AIPE behaviour.

        <p>In 2011, two Ir(III) soft salts formed from dinuclear cationic and mononuclear anionic complexes, bearing a carbazolyl (125) or p-phenylene bridge (126) were reported by Meyer and coworkers. 75 The photoluminescence peaks for 125 and 126 in the solid state are at 594 and 557 nm, respectively. OLEDs using soft salts as emitters were fabricated for the first time with the simple structure: ITO/PEDOT: PSS (40 nm)/PVK (20 nm)/125 or 126/Ca (300 nm)/Al (60 nm). The devices showed electroluminescence peaks at  max 570 and 621 nm, respectively. The highest CE and PE are 0.44 cd/A and 0.17 lm/W -1 for 125 and 0.06 cd/A and 0.03 lm/W -1 for 126, respectively. The poor device performances for both complexes may be attributed to self-quenching effects, and/or to the electron/energy transfer to the conjugated bridging ligands. The higher device performance for 125 may be due to the better charge-carrier injection and transport ability of the carbazole moiety compared with the phenylene spacer in 126. In 2016, a series of C^N-type bridged Ir(III) dinuclear complexes 127-132 with short conjugated bridging ligands (2-phenylpyrimidine derivatives) were reported by Zhou and coworkers. 114,115 The corresponding mononuclear complexes were also obtained. All the mono-and dinuclear complexes were successfully separated by column chromatography due to their different molecular dipole moments. The dinuclear complexes 127-132 showed intense orange phosphorescence (τ = 0.18-0.48 µs) red-shifted relative to the corresponding mononuclear analogues. The PLQYs of 127-132 are in the range of 36-68% in CH 2 Cl 2 solution, which are high values for an orange-red diiridium complex.

        <p>In summary, highly efficient green and yellow/orange emitting OLEDs based on diiridium complexes emitters have been achieved in the past three years by both solution processing and vacuum evaporation, which challenges the previous misconception that dinuclear complexes are poor phosphors and usually show unsatisfactory performance in OLEDs. However, some challenges still remain in the future work: (i) Unlike their monoiridium analogues, highly stable and efficient deep-blue emissive diiridium complexes are still absent: further ingenious molecular design and a short conjugated bridge unit may solve this issue. (ii) Red emissive diiridium complexes can be easily designed by installing long conjugated bridging ligands between the iridium centers. However, highly efficient red emissive diiridium complexes are still rare. Modified designs that avoid intramolecular energy processes from MLCT to LC (bridging ligand center) states may enhance the emission. (iii) Further optimization of device structures to improve the EL performance with low roll-off is still needed. It is worth noting that the AIPE-active diiridium complexes which exhibit intense emission in the solid and pure film states are potential candidates in non-doped (neat film) OLEDs.

As shown in Fig. 43a andb, below T ≈ 10 K, the steep decrease of the emission decay time with increasing temperature is a consequence of splitting of the T 1 state into substates and increasing the population of triplet substate III. Significant zero-field splitting (ZFS) energy of ΔE(III-II, I) ≈ 2.5 cm -1 will lead to an additional decay component that results from the direct effect of spin-lattice relaxation (SLR). The radiative rate k(III) is calculated to be 20 times higher than for the substates I and II. Thus, two decay components are observed. When focusing on the temperature range of ∼20 ≤ T ≤ ∼80 K, steady decay with an average decay time of 55 μs can be assigned to the transitions from the three triplet substates to the ground state. In the temperature range of ∼80 ≤ T ≤ 300 K, the decay time decreases obviously from 55 to 7 μs at room temperature. The ambient-temperature emission of 154 is assigned to the combined TADF (87%) and phosphorescence (13%). The combined emission shows a shorter decay time than the pure TADF emission (8 μs) (Fig. 43c). Accordingly, dual emissive Cu(I) complexes represent attractive candidates for highly efficient OLEDs by decreasing the population time of the excitons. To obtain blue emission from a Cu(I) complex is still a big challenge. Recently, Kato"s group synthesized a series of deep-blue emitting dinuclear Cu(I) complexes 155-157, using both the traditional solution method and the recently developed solvent-free thermal method. 216 At room temperature, 155-157 showed bright emission in the range from 435 to 452 nm. These data represent the bluest emission in Cu(I) complex systems so far reported. The detailed TD-DFT investigations revealed all three complexes possess relatively small ΔE ST in the range of 1500-1700 cm -1 (0.19-0.21 eV). The short decay times within 5 µs for all three complexes at room temperature indicated TADF in each complex. It is worth noting that the complex 155 showed the shortest decay time of 2.25 µs in TADF-active Cu(I) complexes reported so far.Please do not adjust margins More recently, a new three-fold bridged dinuclear Cu(I) complex 154 that exhibits sky-blue emission peaking at 488 nm in the solid state at ambient temperature has been reported by Yersin"s group. 215 Benefiting from the rigid molecular structure, high PLQY (≈ 85%) was observed for 154 in the solid state.

Slight blue-shifts in the emission were observed on cooling solid samples of 167-169 from 293 to 77 K. This observation is unusual for TADF emission which usually red-shifts on cooling. The blue shift was tentatively explained by a distortion from a tetrahedral ground-state to a more flattened excited state after MLCT excitation, leading to a larger energy gap.In 2016, three tetraphosphane bridged dinuclear Cu(I) complexes 167-169, terminally chelated by a borate diimine anion, were synthesized in good yields by Lu"s group. 220 A small ΔE ST (322 cm -1 -644 cm -1 ; 30-80 meV) observed in these complexes indicated TADF emission at ambient temperature.

        <p>In 2010, a highly emissive bis(phosphine)diarylamido dinuclear Cu(I) complex 175 was reported by Peters and co-workers. 223 The high PLQY can be attributed to the less distortion in the excited state of 175 which was established by a relatively small Stokes shift and TD-DFT calculations.

        <p>Electrochemiluminescence (ECL, also known as electrogenerated chemiluminescence) is a process whereby species generated at an electrode interface undergo electrochemical reactions to form an electronically excited state that emits light upon relaxation to a lower-level state. Specifically, as one of the most important bioanalytical detection methods, ECL has been widely used in clinical diagnostics and environmental assays due to its extremely low detection limit, high sensitivity and fast rate of sample analysis. 226 Generally, ECL can be produced through two dominant pathways, namely the annihilation and co-reactant pathways. 227 The most ubiquitous and famous ECL luminophore is the mononuclear species, [Ru(bpy) 3 ] 2+ (bpy = 2,2"-bipyridine) (Fig. 46) first reported in 1972 by Tokel and Bard. 228 Since then, many attempts have been made to decorate the ligands of Ru complexes so as to improve the ECL efficiency and sensitivity. 17 Alongside the well-studied mononuclear complexes, dinuclear or multinuclear Ru(II) complexes are considered to be a promising approach to enhance ECL properties because of their multiple redox centers.

It is worth noting that the reversible color switching was not observed in dinuclear ruthenium complex 186 under the same conditions. These results establish that the reversible color switching in electroluminescence is determined by the choice of bridging ligand. In 2009, the ECL properties of a series of dinuclear Ru(II) complexes 187-189 brigded by alkyl chains of different length (n = 3, 5, 8) were studied by Peng"s group. 229 The study was carried out in 0.1 M phosphate buffer with co-reactant TPrA or 2-(dibutylamino)ethanol (DBAE) at different working electrodes. The important findings are: 1) The ECL intensity increased with the increasing length of alkyl chain in the complex. Especially, in the presence of 5 mM TPrA or DBAE, complex 189 (n = 8) exhibited remarkable ECL enhancement (～25 times) at a Pt electrode when compared with Ru(bpy) 3 2+ .Please do not adjust margins stabilized by the presence of the polyphenylene units and the Ru 2+ cation in its proximity. Then, either the oxidized PPV accepts an electron from the reduced species to produce the excited state of the PPV, or PPV -is formed by a stepwise electron transfer from the ruthenium component. With either mechanism, green light can be generated at reverse bias.

        <p>2) The log of ECL intensity exhibited a linear increase with increasing log of the concentration of 189 at a glassy carbon electrode with coreactant TPrA. The detection limit is as low as 0.1 fM, which is a remarkable increase in sensitivity compared to Ru(bpy) 3 2+ (200 fM). Furthermore, the TPrA needed with 189 is only 20% of that in the [Ru(bpy) 3 ] 2+ /TPrA system. 84 Interestingly, their electrochemiluminescence color can be tuned by scanning over a potential range from 0.55 to 1.6 V. As shown in Fig. 50a, for complex 191 a weak emission centered at 543 nm can be observed with an applied potential at 0.55 V. When the potential was increased to 0.95 V, a new emission peak centered at 618 nm appeared and the corresponding ECL intensity increased gradually, resulting in a linear response of the ECL intensity ratio (I 618 nm /I 543 nm ) within the scanning potential range from 0.55 to 0.95 V (Fig. 50b). When the applied potential was further increased from 1.0 to 1.25 V, the I 618 nm from the ruthenium moiety increased sharply, while the I 543 nm from the iridium moiety was almost unchanged. Furthermore, the effective overlap between the peaks of the iridium and ruthenium moieties indicated that efficient resonance energy transfer occurs from the iridium to the ruthenium. Consequently in 191 the ECL intensity from ruthenium is higher than that of iridium. Upon further increasing the potential from 1.25 to 1.6 V, the ECL intensity from the ruthenium moiety decreased sharply, and exhibited a linear relationship (Figure 50d) between the ECL intensity and the scanning potential.

        <p>In summary, the key findings are: 1) Dinuclear Ru(II) complexes bearing asymmetrical bridging ligands usually show higher ECL intensity than symmetrical analogues. 2) Most dinuclear examples exhibited enhancement of ECL intensity compared to the corresponding mononuclear Ru(II) complexes and reference Ru(bpy) 3 2+ . However, several challenges still remain for this system when used as ECL labels: 1) The poor water-solubility of most complexes of this type limits their use in bioanalytical detection. 2) Most examples suffer from the quenching of emission by dioxygen and by interactions with the environment. Recently, De Cola"s group reported a water-soluble Pt complex, which showed highly efficient ECL efficiency in aqueous solution (72%) and procell (51%), respectively. 242 Aggregation-induced electrochemiluminescence (AIECL) of a Pt complex through the self-assembly process was considered as a reasonable strategy for higher ECL efficiency. 242 Therefore, this finding may promote highly efficient AIE-active dinuclear metal complexes for use as labels in future bioanalytical detection.In summary, the key findings are: 1) Dinuclear Ru(II) complexes bearing asymmetrical bridging ligands usually show higher ECL intensity than symmetrical analogues. 2) Most dinuclear examples exhibited enhancement of ECL intensity compared to the corresponding mononuclear Ru(II) complexes and reference Ru(bpy) 3 2+ .

        <p>At present, the photocatalytic performance of H 2 or O 2 generation is mainly evaluated by the turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) values. A higher TON reflects a better durability of the photocatalytic system. A higher TOF value reflects a more active catalyst. In recent years, centermetal-free organic dyes and metal complex chromophores as photosensitizers (PSs) have been widely studied in the application of photocatalytic water splitting. However, both metal-free organic dyes and mononuclear metal complex chromophores typically suffer from short operational lifetime due to photodecomposition of the PSs. 44 Therefore, the development of novel supramolecular photocatalysts, comprising only one bi-or multi-metallic complex connected by the different metal components, that function as both a light absorber and catalytic center, has been a popular subject in the field of photocatalytic water splitting.

Rhenium polypyridine complexes are known to act as photocatalysts and electrocatalysts for reducing CO 2 to CO. 289 A major problem with these photocatalysts is the lack of an extended absorption into the visible region. The present approach is to fabricate supramolecular photocatalysts, similar to the photocatalytic H 2 or O 2 production systems. Supramolecular photocatalysts used in the reduction of CO 2 act as both the light absorbing center and the catalytic center. Two distinct reaction mechanisms that use supramolecular photocatalysts for the reduction of CO 2 , are oxidative quenching (OQ) and reductive quenching (RQ). 290 As shown in Fig. 56, for both mechanisms, the reduction of CO 2 proceeds via the reduced form of the catalyst.

        <p>The key findings are: 1) Highly efficient intramolecular energy transfer from an excited Re unit to an excited Ru unit was observed for both complexes, and the emission occurs mainly from excited Ru and Os units. 2) The faster energy transfer rate observed from the Re to the Ru unit, compared with from the Ru or Re to the Os unit, can be attributed to the different energy transfer mechanisms. For example, Furue et al. had reported that the intramolecular excited energy transfer in a Ru-Os dinuclear complex proceeds by a Förster mechanism, 317 whereas the excited Re→Ru energy transfer proceeds via a Dexter mechanism. 318 3) In contrast to 319, the intramolecular Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins excited Ru→Os energy transfer in 320 proceeded very slowly or did not occur, which can be attributed to the longer distance between the Ru and Os units in 320. Refering to supramolecular photocatalysts, 290 dinuclear Ru-Re or Os-Re systems exhibit the best photocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance reported to date for bimetallic systems. Inspired by this, two trinuclear complexes 319 and 320 were compared with their dinuclear Ru-Re and Os-Re analogues. As shown in Fig. 60a, both 319 and 320 can be used as supramolecular photocatalysts for the highly selective formation of CO. Importantly, both 319 and 320 exhibited superior catalytic ability and great durability in the CO 2 reduction process. The TONs for 319 and 320 reached 3552 ± 461 and 4347 ± 421, respectively, after 35 h irradiation, which are higher than the summation of their parent dinuclear Ru-Re and Os-Re complexes. These two trinuclear complexes exhibit the highest TON CO for all reported photocatalytic reactions. The reason for this outstanding performance has been investigated by UV absorption measurements. As shown in Fig. 60b, upon irradiation at λ &gt; 500 nm for 1 h, the spectrum of 319 showed a slight decrease in the band at ca. 420 to 500 nm. The spectral shape was maintained for 6 h. On the contrary, in the case of the Ru-Re analogue, the absorption band at 460 nm sharply decreased in intensity with continuous irradiation (Fig. 60c), which mainly reflects the decomposition of the Ru unit. The corresponding time courses of the absorbance changes at 460 nm for 319 and for dinuclear Ru-Re are shown in Fig. 60d. The change in the absorption intensity matched well with the time courses of photocatalytic CO formation for both catalysts (Fig. 60a).

        <p>A schematic diagram of a tandem DSPEC for light driven CO 2 splitting into CO and O 2 is presented in Fig. 61b. The photocathode plays a key role for the CO 2 reduction. Generally, water reduction of CO 2 to CO is driven at -0.12 V (vs NHE) and E CB (TiO 2 ) ≈ -0.1 V at pH 0. The absence of a suitable p-type oxide photocathode has greatly limited progress in implementing DSPECs. 323 In 2015, Ishitani"s group reported a novel hybrid photocathode consisting of a Ru(II)-Re(I) supramolecular photocatalyst and a NiO electrode for photoelectrochemical CO 2 reduction in a nonaqueous solution. 345 However, light driven photoelectrochemical CO 2 reduction using water as a reductant became a prime target. Consequently, in 2016, a tandem DSPEC with a NiO-RuRe (334) hybrid photocathode and a CoO x /TaON photoanode was reported by Ishitani"s group. 83 Upon irradiation at λ = 460 nm, a photocathodic response was clearly observed starting at approximately -0.1 V vs Ag/AgCl in a CO 2 -purged aqueous solution containing 50 mM NaHCO 3 (pH = 6.6). This photoresponse can be attributed to the electron transfer process from the valence band of the NiO electrode to the excited Ru photosensitizer unit in RuRe.

It can be seen that the formation of CO occurs only when using a NiO-RuRe photocathode with an applied bias.

To accelerate the reaction, a bias of -0.3 V vs CoOx/TaON was applied to NiO-RuRe. Furthermore, a chemical bias of 0.10 V was simultaneously generated from the pH difference between the two electrodes. Finally, this tandem DSPEC showed activity for visible-light-driven catalytic reduction of CO 2 in the aqueous solution to generate CO and O 2 for the first time. The formed O 2 was detected in the liquid phase in the CoOx/TaON photoanode with a Faradaic efficiency of 68% after 60 min of irradiation. Simultaneously, the formed CO was also captured in the gas phase in the NiO-RuRe photocathode chamber with a TON CO of 17. The low catalytic performance of the system was suggested mainly to arise from the photocathode.

        <p>Metal cations play important roles in biological, environmental and life processes. Consequently, great effort has been devoted to the development of effective chemosensors for the detection of various metal cations. 348,352 In this context, representative dinuclear metal complexes are shown in Fig. 69. As a classical strategy, host-guest chemistry of crown ethers has been used to sense guest cations via the formation of non-covalent interactions. 353,354 Yam"s group have pioneered dinuclear Au(I) complexes for these applications. In 1998 complexes 335-338 with bridging diphosphines (dppm = bis(diphenylphosphanyl)methane; dcpm = bis(dicyclohexylphosphanyl)methane) and benzocrown ether functionalized thiolate ligands were reported. 355,356 All these complexes showed bright emission in the range of 492-580 nm in dichloromethane solution at room temperature, originating from a S→Au ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) excited state. These complexes served as luminescent sensors for metal cations, with specificity depending on the size of the crown ether pendants. For example, 335 and 336 with the smaller crown ether sense K + , whereas 337 and 338 with the larger crown ether sense Cs + . Upon addition of metal cations into a solution of 336, the emission at  max 520 nm dropped in intensity and a new band appeared at 720 nm (Fig. 70). This new band was suggested to originate from a thiolate ligand-to-metal-metal charge transfer (LMMCT) excited state due to the enhanced intramolecular Au•••Au interaction in the cation complex. As an extension of this work, Yam et al. reported two new Au(I) complexes 339 and 340 with different bridging dithiolate ligands. 357 Upon addition of various metal cations, UV-vis absorption results indicated that both complexes exhibited preferential binding towards K + over Na + . The X-ray crystal structure of 340-Na (Fig. 71) showed an intramolecular sandwich binding of the Na cation and the two crown ether units with a 1:1 stoichiometry, in agreement with ESI-mass spectrometry results. Furthermore, the intramolecular Au•••Au distance was only 3.0825 Å. In 2004, a new dinuclear Au(I) complex 341 connected by a benzocrown ether functionalized ethynyl bridge was synthesized by Yam"s group. 358 This complex showed intense phosphorescence in both the solid and solution states, which originates from the [σ(Au-P)→π*(C≡C)] or metal-perturbed [π→π*(C≡C)] IL excited states. UV-vis absorption results indicated that 341 specifically recognizes Na + in CH 2 Cl 2 -MeOH (1:1 v/v) at room temperature.Metal cations play important roles in biological, environmental and life processes.

Upon addition of metal cations into a solution of 336, the emission at  max 520 nm dropped in intensity and a new band appeared at 720 nm (Fig. 70). This new band was suggested to originate from a thiolate ligand-to-metal-metal charge transfer (LMMCT) excited state due to the enhanced intramolecular Au•••Au interaction in the cation complex. As an extension of this work, Yam et al. reported two new Au(I) complexes 339 and 340 with different bridging dithiolate ligands. 357 Upon addition of various metal cations, UV-vis absorption results indicated that both complexes exhibited preferential binding towards K + over Na + . The X-ray crystal structure of 340-Na (Fig. 71) showed an intramolecular sandwich binding of the Na cation and the two crown ether units with a 1:1 stoichiometry, in agreement with ESI-mass spectrometry results. Furthermore, the intramolecular Au•••Au distance was only 3.0825 Å. In 2004, a new dinuclear Au(I) complex 341 connected by a benzocrown ether functionalized ethynyl bridge was synthesized by Yam"s group. 358 This complex showed intense phosphorescence in both the solid and solution states, which originates from the [σ(Au-P)→π*(C≡C)] or metal-perturbed [π→π*(C≡C)] IL excited states. UV-vis absorption results indicated that 341 specifically recognizes Na + in CH 2 Cl 2 -MeOH (1:1 v/v) at room temperature.</p>
        <p>As another sensing strategy, calixarene crown ethers have been widely studied as ion receptors that can hold smaller molecules or ions. 359,360 In 2003, a series of luminescent dinuclear Au(I) alkynylcalix [4]crown-5 complexes 342-346 was synthesized by Yam et al. 361 All the complexes exhibited orange emission in dichloromethane solution with a band at 578-585 nm originating from metal-perturbed IL or [σ(Au-P)→π*(phosphine)] triplet excited states. All the complexes showed a binding response to K + and Na + in the order 345 &gt; 346  343  342 &gt; 344 and 346  342 &gt; 343 &gt; 344 &gt; 345. This order was attributed to the different calixcrown cavity size that was induced by the subtle steric effects of the substituents on the phosphine ligand. For example, smaller-sized 345 represented the largest binding constant for Na + and the smallest binding constant for K + . Furthermore, the K + /Na + selectivities of complexes 342-345 are 3 × 10 5 , 1.8 × 10 2 , 1.9 × 10 2 and 13, respectively.As another sensing strategy, calixarene crown ethers have been widely studied as ion receptors that can hold smaller molecules or ions. 359,360 In 2003, a series of luminescent dinuclear Au(I) alkynylcalix [4]crown-5 complexes 342-346 was synthesized by Yam et al. 361 All the complexes exhibited orange emission in dichloromethane solution with a band at 578-585 nm originating from metal-perturbed IL or [σ(Au-P)→π*(phosphine)] triplet excited states.

        <p>In 2009, He et al. reported the dinuclear Au(I) complexes 347 and 348. 362 Both complexes showed bright emission with bands centerd at ca. 448-478 nm in dichloromethane solution at room temperature, assigned to mixed metal-pertubed intraligand (IL) and alkynyl-to-aryl isocyanide (LLCT) excited states. Upon addition of various metal cations, the complexes showed specific binding ability for K + and Cs + , respectively. A new emission band at 600 nm was attributed to a Au•••Au interaction induced via a sandwiched binding mode (Fig. 72), resulting in a reduced HOMO-LUMO energy gap. In 2006, a novel dinuclear Pt(II) alkynylcalixcrown complex 349 was studied for the specific recognition of metal cations by Lo et al. 363 Upon excitation, 349 showed a faint emission band at 738 nm, accompanied by a long-lived phosphorescent lifetime in the microsecond range in acetonitrile solution. The emission of 349 originated predominantly from 3 MLCT [dπ(Pt)→π*(t-Bu 3 -tpy)], and probably mixed with some 3 LLCT [π(C≡C)→π*(t-Bu 3 -tpy)] transitions. The weak emission of 349 was ascribed probably to quenching of the emissive 3 MLCT excited state by photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the electron-rich alkoxy-substituted calixcrown moiety to the platinum terpyridyl unit. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 73, upon addition of various metal cations, complex 349 showed a specific turn-on response for K + , with selectivities of 10 2 -10 4 -fold greater than for other cations. In 2013, Chao"s group proposed a new strategy for the highly selective and sensitive sensing of Cu 2+ ion in aqueous media, in vivo and in vitro by a dinuclear Ru(II) complex 350. 364 As shown in Fig. 74, upon addition of various cations, complex 350 exhibited an almost complete quenching response to Cu 2+ , whereas almost no quenching was observed for other cations. The detection limit for Cu 2+ was as low as 3.33×10 -8 M.

Moreover, the response to CN -was also observed in mixtures of CN -and other anions. The detection limit for CN -was determined to be 5 μM.

Furthermore, complex 351 exhibited higher binding affinity for anions compared with that of complex 352, probably because of the higher acidity of the urea moieties as a result of the introduction of the NO 2 group in 351.In 2010, two dcpm-containing Au(I) thiolate dinuclear complexes 351 and 352 (Fig. 76) with different urea receptors were synthesized by Yam"s group. 368 Complex 351 showed high selectivity and sensitivity for F -.

Almost no change was observed when 354 was treated with other anions. The detection limits were determined to be 0.24 mM for sulphite and 0.14 mM for bisulphite.

        <p>As discussed in section 3.1.1.2, dinuclear Ir(III) complex 116 showed a specific response towards F -via both OPEP and TPEP processes. In 2015, we reported a rapid, highly selective ""turn-on"" phosphorescent probe for sensing ClO 4 -anions in aqueous media and living cells by using a novel AIPE-active dinuclear Ir(III) complex 5•2PF 6 . 85 As shown in Fig. 80, complex 5•2PF 6 essentially showed faint emission in the HEPES buffer (10 mM in CH 3 CN/H 2 O, 1:4, v/v, pH 7.4) with a short decay time (0.02 μs). However, upon addition of different anions and shaking the sample by hand for a few seconds, complex 5•2PF 6 responds specifically toward ClO 4 -with turn-on phosphorescence with a long decay time (0.24 μs) under UV excitation. The detection limit for ClO 4 -was as low as 0.05 ppm. Importantly, under sunlight, the change in the solution from clear to turbid can be easily observed by naked eyes in a few seconds, which provides a convenient strategy for the sensing of anions. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results revealed that nanoaggregates gradually increased in size with the addition of more ClO 4 -(Fig. 81). 1 H NMR and MALDI-TOF negative-ion mass spectra indicated that partial anion exchange has occurred from PF 6 -to ClO 4 -. X-ray crystal structure analysis revealed that 5•2ClO 4 has a more rigid structure compared with 5•2PF 6 which may affect the solubility of the complexes, and induce aggregation in the solvent. Also the increased rigidity of 5•2ClO 4 is responsible for the enhanced phosphorescence. To the best of our knowledge, this represented the first example of anion sensing based on AIPE. Further work is needed to determine if this "anion-exchange induced AIPE" process is a general strategy for the selective phosphorescence-based detection of anions.As discussed in section 3.1.1.2, dinuclear Ir(III) complex 116 showed a specific response towards F -via both OPEP and TPEP processes.

        <p>In 2017, two di-and trinuclear AIEE-active cationic Ir(III) complexes 355 and 356 (Fig. 82a) were synthesized by our group for the rapid, highly selective and sensitive sensing of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) which shows enhanced explosive power compared with that of well-known 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). 86 Indeed, the selective sensing of TNP among other nitro-aromatic explosives is a challenge owing to their similar electron affinities. 380 Both complexes 355 and 356 showed an emission peak at around 571 nm in the pure CH 3 CN solution (Fig. 82b) with low PLQYs of 0.062 and 0.041, respectively. However, the obviously enhanced emission which was observed in mixed CH 3 CN/H 2 O solution (v/v = 1:9) with higher PLQYs of 0.20 and 0.088, respectively, identified both complexes are AIEE materials. Taking advantage of this AIEE behaviour in aqueous solution, both complexes exhibited a specific response to TNP with phosphorescence quenching, whereas no quenching was observed upon the addition of other nitro-explosives. The Stern-Volmer (SV) plots (Fig. 83) were used to analyze the luminescence quenching efficiency, and the estimated K sv values for 355 and 356 are 49749 M -1 and 96178 M -1 , respectively, which are among the highest values reported for luminescent sensors. 375,379,381,382 The detection limits for 355 and 356 as phosphorescent sensors for TNP are 0.51 and 0.39 μM, respectively. All the above results demonstrated that AIEE-active complexes can be highly selective and sensitive detectors of TNP in aqueous solution. Since the LUMO energy of 355 and 356 (-2.43 eV) is higher than that of TNP (-3.89 eV), the electron transfer may occur from the higher energy LUMOs of 355 and 356 to the lower energy LUMO of TNP. It is worth noting that compared to the reported AIE-or AIEE-active mononuclear phosphorescence Ir(III) complexes used for detection of TNP, 379,381,382 dinuclear complexes 355 and trinuclear 356 exhibit lower LUMO levels due to their more conjugated structures. This reduced LUMO level is closer to the LUMO level of TNP, but is lower than other nitroaromatic explosives, which may facilitate highly efficient selectivity for the detection of TNP. Furthermore, in aqueous media, strong electrostatic interactions can be formed between ionized TNP with a negative charge and cationic complexes 355 and 356. Therefore, the quenching mechanism of these complexes towards TNP is due to a combination of strong electrostatic interactions and efficient electron transfer processes. In summary, phosphorescent sensors based on di-or multi-nuclear transition metal complexes have significant potential advantages over mononuclear complexes, such as: 1) Deep-red emission is easily obtained by introduction of a longer conjugated bridging ligand in the bimetallic complexes; 72 this is a great advantage in biological sensing. 2) "Turn-off" sensors usually suffer from limited sensitivity due to competing luminescence quenching by heavy metal ions. 383 Therefore, "turn-on" sensors are highly desired. Dinuclear metal complexes are good candidates in this regard, because most dinuclear complexes have lower emission efficiency due to the intramolecular energy transfer from the luminescent 3 MLCT state to the bridging ligand-centerd excited state which is less emissive. 72 However, upon addition of analytes, enhanced emission may be observed due to the new electronic structure of the complex that is induced by a strong interaction between the bridging ligand and the analyte. 3) Highly efficient detection of analytes in aqueous solution or solid state, rather than in organic solvent, is highly desired. Recently, luminescent detection of analytes by AIE or AIEE materials has become popular because of their highly efficient luminescence in aqueous solution, and even in the solid state through the formation of aggregates. 373,381,382,384 In principle, AIE or AIEE materials can be easily obtained by designing new di-or multi-nuclear complexes bearing Schiff-base or flexible chain-type bridging ligands. 50,85,86,[109][110][111]In 2017, two di-and trinuclear AIEE-active cationic Ir(III) complexes 355 and 356 (Fig. 82a) were synthesized by our group for the rapid, highly selective and sensitive sensing of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) which shows enhanced explosive power compared with that of well-known 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). 86 Indeed, the selective sensing of TNP among other nitro-aromatic explosives is a challenge owing to their similar electron affinities. 380 Both complexes 355 and 356 showed an emission peak at around 571 nm in the pure CH 3 CN solution (Fig. 82b) with low PLQYs of 0.062 and 0.041, respectively.

        <p>Luminescent imaging or sensing of biomolecules and living cells is of great significance in facilitating the study of biological processes in real time. 385,386 Phosphorescent transition metal complexes have attracted much attention in applications such as O 2 sensing, mitochondrial imaging and tracking, and DNA imaging and sensing, 349,[387][388][389][390] due to the excellent photophysical properties of the complexes, such as: 1) Large Stokes shifts that reduce the excitation beam and inner filter effects. 2) Long excited lifetimes that can effectively discriminate the long-lived imaging signals from the short-lived background autofluorescence. 3) Synthetic versatility to optimise photochemical and physicochemical stability. 4) Inherent triplet excited state phosphorescent emission could provide excellent sensitivity to molecular dioxygen, enabling hypoxia imaging.

        <p>The quantitative determination of oxygen concentration is of critical value for life sciences and environmental sciences. [394][395][396] The basis of oxygen sensing is via phosphorescence quenching which occurs by energy transfer from the triplet excited state of the phosphorescent chromophore to the triplet ground state of molecular O 2 . 390,397,398 Phosphorescent complexes such as Ir(III), Ru(II), Pt(II) and Pd(II) have been widely studied for O 2 sensing due to their high quantum yield (Φ), long decay lifetime, good solubility, and high stability. 395,396 However, studies on bimetallic complexes for the sensing of O 2 are very rare. This is surprising as compared with mononuclear complexes, bimetallic systems have a great advantage for O 2 sensing in living cells due to the relative ease of obtaining deep-red emission. 72 It is well known that the lower energy deep-red or near-infrared emission is highly desirable in biological applications for minimizing photodamage to biological samples. 399 Recently, Zhao"s group synthesized the red-emitting dinuclear Ir(III) complex 357 bearing a 2-pyrimidine-benzimidazole bridging ligand (Fig. 84a). 400 The mono-cationic structure of 357 is beneficial for enhanced emission, compared to the low quantum yields of most dicationic Ir complexes. Complex 357 showed red phosphorescence in dichloromethane solution with peaks at 619 and 659 nm, which are red-shifted by 85 nm relative to the corresponding monoiridium complex. DFT calculations indicated that the emission of 357 originated mainly from the 3 ILCT state located on the bridging ligand. Ir(III) complexes with 3 ILCT character are known to possess longer phosphorescent lifetimes and better oxygen sensitivity than those with 3 MLCT character. 401 As shown in Fig. 84b, the emission intensity as well as the lifetime of 357 gradually decreased with the incremental increase of O 2 concentrations. The Stern-Volmer plots with excitation at 405 nm showed a linear relationship between O 2 concentration and I 0 /I (I = the emission intensity, and I 0 = emission intensity without oxygen) indicating that 357 can be used as a phosphorescent probe for the quantitative determination of oxygen. Importantly, intracellular O 2 levels in HeLa cells were successfully detected by the probe signals based on both emission intensity and phosphorescence lifetime using time-resolved luminescence imaging (TRLI) techniques. As shown in Fig. 85, the phosphorescence intensity of 357 gradually increased as the O 2 concentration dropped from 21 to 2.5%, and was accompanied by an enhanced lifetime. These results suggest that new red-emitting dinuclear Ir(III) complexes are a a promising strategy for obtaining efficient oxygen probes.The quantitative determination of oxygen concentration is of critical value for life sciences and environmental sciences.

Concomitantly, the cytotoxicity of the complexes increased with the increasing number of methylene groups. As mentioned in 3.1.1.2, the dinuclear complexes 118-123 serve as mitochondrial imaging dyes via a clathrin-mediated endocytotic pathway, without requiring prior membrane permeabilization or replacement of the culture medium. 87 More importantly, 119 and 122 were further developed for tracking mitochondrial morphological changes during the early stages of apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 88, upon exposure to cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), the reticulum-like mitochondria were gradually transformed to small and dispersed fragments, which is consistent with previous reports.

        <p>The development of optical probes for DNA within the cell nucleus is of great importance for understanding the role of DNA in genetic disease and tumorgenesis. 410,411 In 1990, Barton et al. reported the first case of a mononuclear Ru(II) complex 365 (Fig. 89) as a molecular "light switch" for DNA structures in vitro. No photoluminescence was observed in aqueous solution at ambient temperatures, but emission was dramatically enhanced in the presence of DNA, referred to as the "light-switch" effect, owing to intercalation between the Ru(II) complex and DNA. 412 Since then, numerous charged mononuclear Ru(II) complexes have been developed to display excellent water solubility and to bind to DNA with high affinities through an intercalative mechanism. 383, 413--417 In 1993, Carson et al. reported the first cases of dinuclear Ru(II) complexes with high binding affinity for DNA: they also described that the binding affinity can be highly dependent on the ancillary ligands of the metal centers. 415 Since then, much effort has been devoted in the development of dinuclear Ru(II) complex systems for DNA binding. 101-108, 418, 419 Interestingly, in contrary to the mononuclear Ru(II) complex system, most dinuclear Ru(II) complexes bind to DNA via a groove binding mechanism: an initial groove-bound and a final intercalated geometry. 24 For example, Lincoln and Nordén found that the complex 3 rearranges from a groove-binding to an intercalative geometry that is reached by threading one of the Ru(phen) 2 moieties through the DNA duplex, thereby intercalating one of the bridging dppz ligands between the DNA base pairs and thus placing one metal center in each groove. 102 Lincoln, Nordén and colleagues also reported a novel type of chiral bis-intercalating Ru(II) complex 366 with extremely high binding affinity (K&gt;10 8 M -1 ) for DNA via a remarkable bis-intercalative binding mode, that is around two orders of magnitude higher than that of the mononuclear complex 367. 413,417 The binding ability with duplex and quadruplex DNA of dinuclear Ru(II) complexes 368-370 (Fig. 90) was firstly investigated by Thomas" group in 2006. 420 Interestingly, both complexes 368 and 369 exhibited enhanced binding ability for quadruplex compared to duplex DNA, which is accompanied by a distinctive "quadruplex light-switch" effect: i.e., highly enhanced and sufficiently blue-shifted emission away from the normal duplex phenomenon. This system showed unique advantages as in vivo quadruplex probes. In 2008, Lutterman et al. showed that intercalation was not required for 369 to act as a molecular "light switch" for DNA based on relative viscosity measurements. 421 Fig. 89 The chemical structures of complexes 3, 365-367.The development of optical probes for DNA within the cell nucleus is of great importance for understanding the role of DNA in genetic disease and tumorgenesis. 410,411 In 1990, Barton et al. reported the first case of a mononuclear Ru(II) complex 365 (Fig. 89) as a molecular "light switch" for DNA structures in vitro.

        <p>Although numerous probes for DNA have been developed in vitro, studies involving direct imaging of DNA in living cells are still rare, and are limited by the poor membrane permeability of probe molecules. 403,422,423 In 2009, dinuclear complex 368 was used for directly imaging nuclear DNA of living cells by Gill and co-workers. 424 The inherent hydrophilicity and high charge of 368 would imply that the molecule will not freely diffuse across the cell membrane. Therefore, the mechanism of cellular uptake of the complex was investigated by transmission electron microscopy. As shown in Fig. 91a, after incubating MCF-7 cells with solutions of 368, it was found that 368 mainly located within the nucleus of the MCF-7 cells with high concentration. A relatively lower concentration of 368 is located throughout the cell cytosol. Remarkably, as highlighted in Fig. 91b, the absence of 368 from endosomal and lysosomal compartments confirmed that cellular uptake of 368 is via active transport rather than an endocytotic pathway. 368 has been investigated as a luminescent probe for DNA. As shown in Fig. 91c, 368 enables visualization of characteristic structural changes in nuclear DNA as cells progress through the cell cycle. As emerging "functional imaging" techniques, fluorescence (FLIM) and phosphorescence (PLIM) lifetime imaging microscopy make it possible to monitor the changes of some specific biologically relevant microenvironmental parameters and DNA transformations characteristic of different cell cycle stages via reporting of lifetime. 425 Particularly, PLIM presents the key advantage over FLIM of a dramatic increase in contrast and probe selectivity due to the possibility of rejecting scattered excitation light and short-lived autofluorescence via long-lived luminescent labeling (τ &gt; 100 ns). 426 By far the majority of studies in this field involve PLIM for sensing of parameters such as pH and biological oxygen, however, the sensing of biologically important molecules (such as DNA and RNA) is still very rare. 427 In 2011, the Δ-and Λ-enantiomers of mononuclear Ru(II) complex 371 (Fig. 90) wer presented to investigate the diastereomeric interaction inside the cell and cell nucleus in fixed and live CHO cells by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and PLIM techniques by Svensson et al. 428 CLSM images indicated that the Δ-enantiomer showed brighter emission in the nucleus and weaker emission in the nucleolus than the Λ-enantiomer. Since both enantiomers exhibited similar affinity to DNA, such a significant difference in the cell staining patterns was attributed to the higher quantum yield of the Δ-enantiomer over that of the Λ-enantiomer when bound to DNA. Live cell PLIM and intense imaging indicated that the cell membrane was impermeable to both enantiomers unless photoactivation aided the uptake. Upon photoactivated internalization, the Δ-enantiomer exhibited the most intense emission with the longest lifetime in the nuclei, while the Λ-enantiomer showed more intense emission in the cytoplasm but longer emission lifetime in the nuclei.Although numerous probes for DNA have been developed in vitro, studies involving direct imaging of DNA in living cells are still rare, and are limited by the poor membrane permeability of probe molecules. 403,422,423 In 2009, dinuclear complex 368 was used for directly imaging nuclear DNA of living cells by Gill and co-workers. 424 The inherent hydrophilicity and high charge of 368 would imply that the molecule will not freely diffuse across the cell membrane.

        <p>In 2014, PLIM technology was exploited for DNA targeting by Thomas"s group. 88 This process is independent of probe concentration, whilst providing information on the micro-environment of the probe itself. Furthermore, the large timescale of PLIM, within hundreds of nanoseconds to microseconds, can avoid common problems of biomolecular autofluorescence. In this work, dinuclear complexes 369 and 370 were found to show two-photon absorption for the first time. It is well known that the lower energy two-photon absorption can facilitate luminescence-based deep tissue imaging. Thus, by combining the advantages of longer phosphorescent lifetime and two-photon absorption 369 and 370 were exploited as probes for cellular DNA. As shown in Fig. 92, 2P-PLIM images presented luminescence decay kinetics from live MCF-7 cells labeled with 369. The emission predominantly originated from the cell nuclei with a lifetime of 165 ± 16 ns (left). A similar emission lifetime from the nucleus (176 ± 11 ns) was observed when focusing upon a single cell (right). The capability of 369 and 370 to act as high-resolution 2P-PLIM DNA stains was further studied. Fig. 93 shows 2P-PLIM (left) and confocal (right) imaging of HeLa metaphase spreads labeled with 369. Similar PLIM intensity and lifetime images of the chromosomes are observed from both the metaphase and interphase nuclei (182 ± 12 ns and 182 ± 4 ns, respectively). Furthermore, the observed small region of short-lived emission (Fig. 93,location c) was attributed to a precipitate of 369.

        <p>In 2014, two new dinuclear Ir(III)-Ru(II) complexes 372 and 373 (Fig. 94) which function as luminescent nuclear DNA-imaging agents for confocal microscopy were presented by Thomas"s group. 429 Complexes 372 and 373 showed unstructured emission with peaks at 660 and 675 nm, respectively in acetonitrile solution, which arise from a Ru(II)-based 3 MLCT state. Cellular-imaging experiments using 372 and 373 were carried out. The key findings are: 1) Both complexes exhibited superior cellular uptake properties in comparison with Ru(II)-Ru(II) analogues, which is due to the lower charge of the Ir(III)-Ru(II) system, and hence increased lipophilicity. 2) Fluorinated derivative 373 exhibited rapid and enhanced nuclear staining in HeLa cells compared to 372 (Fig. 95). This indicates that fluorination can promote cellular uptake of transition-metal bioprobes. In 2017, two new dinuclear Ir(III) complexes 374 and 375 (Fig. 96) were reported by Kim"s group. 430 Both complexes exhibited an appreciable affinity for single-stranded DNA and double-stranded DNA in vitro. Specifically, 374 displayed a unique G-quadruplex DNA binding affinity with larger enhancement of emission, but 375 did not. The reason was attributed to the more extended planar structure in 374 that more easily intercalates into G-quadruplexes. However, cellular imaging experiments indicated that cell nucleus stains were not observed for both complexes, which were localized only in the cytosol of HeLa cells. In contrast to the rigid, planar and hydrophobic linker in 374 and 375, Liu et al. reported the dinuclear Ir(III) complex 376 (Fig. 96) with a flexible pentamethylene linker. 376 showed specific binding to G-quadruplex DNA in vitro due to the strong electrostatic interaction between the complex and G-quadruplex DNA. 431 Specific recognition of mismatched DNA is of great importance for cancer diagnosis and therapy, since DNA mismatches are associated with oncogenic transformation. [432][433][434] In 2016, Che"s group reported a series of luminescent mono-and dinuclear Pt(II) complexes with out-of-plane bulky ancillary ligands. These complexes showed a specific binding affinity towards intracellular mismatched DNA. 387 As shown in Fig. 97, dinuclear Pt(II) complex 377 showed faint emission in the presence of well-matched DNA of HCT116 cells, whereas greatly enhanced emission was observed in the presence of mismatched DNA of HCT116N cells. This difference was attributed to the specific binding between the complex and mismatched DNA via cooperative π-stacking and a groove binding interaction (Fig. 97a), since the mismatched sites possess larger binding pockets. Pt(II) complexes with out-of-plane bulky ancillary ligands are, therefore, promising candidates for cancer diagnosis via simple emission spectroscopy measurements.

In contrast to the rigid, planar and hydrophobic linker in 374 and 375, Liu et al. reported the dinuclear Ir(III) complex 376 (Fig. 96) with a flexible pentamethylene linker. 376 showed specific binding to G-quadruplex DNA in vitro due to the strong electrostatic interaction between the complex and G-quadruplex DNA. 431 Specific recognition of mismatched DNA is of great importance for cancer diagnosis and therapy, since DNA mismatches are associated with oncogenic transformation. [432][433][434] In 2016, Che"s group reported a series of luminescent mono-and dinuclear Pt(II) complexes with out-of-plane bulky ancillary ligands. These complexes showed a specific binding affinity towards intracellular mismatched DNA. 387 As shown in Fig. 97, dinuclear Pt(II) complex 377 showed faint emission in the presence of well-matched DNA of HCT116 cells, whereas greatly enhanced emission was observed in the presence of mismatched DNA of HCT116N cells. This difference was attributed to the specific binding between the complex and mismatched DNA via cooperative π-stacking and a groove binding interaction (Fig. 97a), since the mismatched sites possess larger binding pockets. Pt(II) complexes with out-of-plane bulky ancillary ligands are, therefore, promising candidates for cancer diagnosis via simple emission spectroscopy measurements. Please do not adjust margins</p>
        <p>In summary, the study of phosphorescent probes for dynamic imaging and monitoring of biomolecules, especially in living cells, is a new research field that is gaining momentum. Generally, the cellular uptake is influenced by the overall charge, size, hydrophobicity and structure of the conjugated moiety of the complex. Dinuclear metal complexes as biosensors show several advantages over their mononuclear counterparts, such as: 1) Ease of obtaining deep-red emission by introduction of a longer conjugated bridging ligand. Red emitters are important for biological sensing in living cells and in deep tissue. 2) Dinuclear complexes usually exhibit better photostability when compared with mononuclear analogues via introduction of a bulky conjugated bridge to enhance the coordination strength between the metal center atoms and the bridging ligand. High stability is beneficial for long-time imaging and tracking. 3) Dinuclear metal complexes have been used as a selective probe for DNA by the rational design of symmetric/asymmetric chemical structures of dinuclear complexes to control the different modes of groove binding. Therefore, further developments of new biosensors based on dinuclear complexes are expected.In summary, the study of phosphorescent probes for dynamic imaging and monitoring of biomolecules, especially in living cells, is a new research field that is gaining momentum.

        <p>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a non-invasive medical technique comprising a photoactivated process to destroy malignant cells via the generation of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) while sparing the normal tissues. Singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) as a primary toxic ROS is produced by energy transfer from the triplet excited state of photosensitizers to the ground state of O 2 . [435][436][437][438] Series of fluorescent porphyrin-based 439 and BODIPY-based 440 photosensitizers have been developed to generate 1 O 2 for the treatment of cancer cells. However, these kinds of photosensitizers usually suffer from the poor conversion rate of singlet oxygen, and need a long irradiation time which can result in harmful side-effects on human skin. Phosphorescent photosensitizers based on transition metals, such as Ru(II) and Ir(III), are promising candidates for PDT, and they show several advantages compared with fluorescent photosensitizers, 441,442 such as: 1) Rapid and efficient triplet excited state generation owing to the strong SOC of the complex, which can promote the formation of 1 O 2 . 2) The longer triplet excited lifetimes of complexes is beneficial to the efficient production of 1 O 2 . 3) Deeper tissue-penetrating near-infrared (NIR) light can be obtained via specific functionalisation of the chelating ligands and the bridge that surround the metal atoms. Currently, most reported phosphorescent photosensitizers for PDT are focused on mononuclear metal complexes, with only rare examples of dinuclear species.Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a non-invasive medical technique comprising a photoactivated process to destroy malignant cells via the generation of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) while sparing the normal tissues.

        <p>Recently, a series of dinuclear complexes 378-382 (Fig. 98) acting as PDT photosensitizers toward human SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells in vitro was reported by Sun"s group. 443 The rigid π-conjugated linkers of the complexes served to expand the visible absorption region and to enhance the molar extinction coefficients. More recently, a series of deep-red emissive Ir(III) complexes 383-385 with different numbers of iridium centers, and the corresponding nanoparticles (NPs) (Fig. 100a) have been studied as photosensitizers for PDT in vitro and in vivo by our group. 90 The assembly of NPs is shown in Fig. 100b, comprising the iridium complexes as the core which were encapsulated by a biocompatible 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[maleimide(pol y(ethyleneglycol))-2000] (DSPE-PEG-MAL), and with the HIV-1 transactivator (RKKRRQRRRC) as the surface functionalization group. HIV-1 Tat is the cell penetrating peptide, which can effectively enhance the cell penetrability of the NPs. Complexes 383-385 are AIE materials, which show enhanced emission in water-THF mixtures compared to that in pure THF solutions. In contrast to the relatively weak emission observed from complexes 383-385 with PLQYs in the water-THF mixtures of only 11%, 5% and 8%, respectively, their corresponding NPs (NP1-3) showed a remarkable enhancement with PLQYs of 33%, 15% and 35%, respectively, in water solution. The NPs are deep-red emitters with  max 652 nm, 671 nm and 690 nm, respectively. The 1 O 2 generation ability was found to increase with the increasing of numbers of Ir centers for both the PSs and the NPs; this was evaluated by measuring the absorbance of indocyanine green (ICG) upon light irradiation. The PDT effect of the PSs 383-385 and their derived NPs for HeLa cells in vitro were investigated. As shown in Fig. 101A-D, all the NPs showed negligible dark cytotoxicity. However, as expected, all NPs showed strong photocytotoxicity under light irradiation (20 mW cm -2 ) for 30 min. The photocytotoxicity increased incrementally with the numbers of Ir centers, with NP3 exhibiting the best PDT performance. In contrast to the impressive PDT properties of the NPs, all the PSs exhibited a poor PDT effect. Cellular uptake experiments indicated that NP3 showed significantly stronger emission in comparison with PS3 which was located at the cytoplasm of HeLa cells. Tumor inhibition experiments using NP3 with or without light were carried out in vivo. As shown in Fig. 101E andF, in the groups 1, 2 and 3 without either light or NP3, the relative tumor volume increased 8-9 times after 14 days of feeding. In sharp contrast to the groups 1-3, in the group 4, treated with both light and NP3 simultaneously, the tumor volume was significantly reduced, indicating that NP3 is a promising photosensitizer for PDT in vivo.Recently, a series of dinuclear complexes 378-382 (Fig. 98) acting as PDT photosensitizers toward human SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells in vitro was reported by Sun"s group. 443 The rigid π-conjugated linkers of the complexes served to expand the visible absorption region and to enhance the molar extinction coefficients.

        <p>In summary, the development of photosensitizers based on dinuclear or multinuclear complexes for PDT is still a largely unexplored topic. However, this kind of photosensitizer has exhibited better PDT performance compared with their corresponding mononuclear complexes, with clearly increased 1 O 2 generation ability. The reasons may be attributed to the wider absorption range of multinuclear complexes in the visible light region, and the greater production of triplet excitons which is induced by the increased numbers of Ir centers, accompanied by enhanced spin-orbit coupling.In summary, the development of photosensitizers based on dinuclear or multinuclear complexes for PDT is still a largely unexplored topic.

        <p>Mechanochromic luminescent (MCL) materials are a class of "smart" materials whose emission colors can be changed when an external force (such as grinding, crushing, rubbing, or extrusion) is applied, leading to either a chemical or a physical structural change. 444,445 The physical mechanisms of MCL are mainly ascribed to the phase transformations from a crystalline state to a different crystalline state, or from a crystalline state to an amorphous state. These transformations are accompanied by a change in the mode of molecular packing and molecular conformation, which affects the HOMO-LUMO energy levels and consequently alters the luminescent properties. Generally, this force-triggered luminescent change can be reversed and the original emission is restored via a recrystallization process when the treated material is heated or exposed to organic solvent/vapour. A variety of MCL materials have been developed, including organic small-molecules, [446][447][448] metal clusters, [449][450][451] metal complexes, 54,452,453 carbon dots, 454 polymers, [455][456][457] metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) 53,458 and perovskites. 459,460 There is huge potential for MCL materials in applications such as sensors, memory chips and security inks. The development of metal complexes in this context is a significant topic due to their excellent phosphorescent properties.

        <p>In 2015, Seki et al. reported that the dinuclear Au(I) isocyanide complex 392 with pyridyl end groups exhibited interconvertible tetracolored emission. 476 As shown in Fig. 105a, 392 exhibited four individual solid state emissions (blue, green, yellow and orange) from the samples named as 2B, 2G, 2Y and 2O, respectively. The as-synthesized solid sample of 392 is 2Y. Soaking 2Y in acetone solution (step i in Fig. 105c) lead to the blue-emitting solid sample 2B which immediately transforms to a green-emitting sample 2G upon drying in the air (step ii in Fig. 105c). No further color change was observed even under reduced pressure for weeks. When 2G was mechanically ground in a ball-mill at 4600 rpm for 10 min (step iii in Fig. 105c), the yellow emission of 2Y was recovered. After grinding for an additional 5 min (step iv in Fig. 105c), orange emission was observed, corresponding to the formation of 2O. PXRD patterns showed obvious crystalline states of 2B, 2G and 2Y, whereas the ground 2O was amorphous. Single crystal and PXRD analyses indicated that aurophilic interactions were not present in 2B and 2G, but were present in 2Y.

Upon grinding, 394 exhibited obvious MCL properties with green emission changing to yellow.

        <p>To study the effect of o-, m-and p-isomerization on MCL properties, complexes 398-400 were synthesized. 479 All these complexes exhibited AIE activity. The o-isomer 398 exhibited reversible MCL behaviour; the m-isomer 399 displayed reversible mechanical force-induced luminescence enhancement behaviour; whereas no MCL behaviour was observed for p-isomer 400. Furthermore, two new m-substituted complexes 401 and 402 also showed reversible mechanical force-induced luminescence enhancement, which is consistent with the data for 399. 480 More recently, Chen et al. reported a new bipyridine-bridged dinuclear Au(I) complex 403, which showed AIE and MCL properties simultaneously. 481 An SEM image (Fig. 107 In 2016, 2,2"-binaphthyl-bridged dinuclear Au(I) complex 404 was synthesized by Ito"s group. 482 As shown in Fig. 108 In 2015, a series of dicationic dinuclear Au(I) cyclophane complexes 405-409 with various counteranions (X -) was reported by Deák et al. 483 Interestingly, the emission colors varied from yellow to red, depending on the different counteranions. All the complexes exhibited reversible thermochromic (room temperature to 77 K) and MCL properties. XRD results indicated a crystalline-to-amorphous phase transformation occurred during the grinding process. The authors proposed that N-H•••X interactions played a significant role in the observed MCL properties, while the intermolecular Au•••Au interaction was effectually precluded by the introduction of the bulky diphosphine ligands. The dicationic structure could also disfavour Au•••Au interactions due to Coulombic repulsion, although the authors do not comment on this. In 2016, Yagai et al. reported the new complex 410 with flexible triethylene glycol (TEG) side chains. 484 As shown in Fig. 109, before grinding complex 410 exhibited structured emission peaks at 427 and 452 nm. Upon grinding of 410 for only 1 s, yellow emission with  max at 564 nm appeared. Further repeated grinding of 410 gave green emission with  max at 536 nm. Polarized optical microscopy (POM) revealed three different phases of 410 during the grinding process. As shown in Fig. 110, the green-emitting and blue-emitting phases were found in a birefringence crystalline domain, which is characteristic of a crystalline state. However, no birefringence was presented in the yellow-emitting phase, indicating an amorphous state. These results indicated that the MCL mechanism of 410 was attributed to a rare crystal-to-crystal transformation mediated by a transient amorphous state. In 2014, three dinuclear Au(I) complexes 411-413 bearing glycol bridges of different lengths were reported by Liang et al. 485 All complexes showed obvious AIE properties in different solvent-water mixtures. However, in the solid state, 411-413To study the effect of o-, m-and p-isomerization on MCL properties, complexes 398-400 were synthesized. 479 All these complexes exhibited AIE activity. The o-isomer 398 exhibited reversible MCL behaviour; the m-isomer 399 displayed reversible mechanical force-induced luminescence enhancement behaviour; whereas no MCL behaviour was observed for p-isomer 400. Furthermore, two new m-substituted complexes 401 and 402 also showed reversible mechanical force-induced luminescence enhancement, which is consistent with the data for 399. 480 More recently, Chen et al. reported a new bipyridine-bridged dinuclear Au(I) complex 403, which showed AIE and MCL properties simultaneously. 481 An SEM image (Fig. 107 In 2016, 2,2"-binaphthyl-bridged dinuclear Au(I) complex 404 was synthesized by Ito"s group. 482 As shown in Fig. 108 In 2015, a series of dicationic dinuclear Au(I) cyclophane complexes 405-409 with various counteranions (X -) was reported by Deák et al. 483 Interestingly, the emission colors varied from yellow to red, depending on the different counteranions. All the complexes exhibited reversible thermochromic (room temperature to 77 K) and MCL properties. XRD results indicated a crystalline-to-amorphous phase transformation occurred during the grinding process. The authors proposed that N-H•••X interactions played a significant role in the observed MCL properties, while the intermolecular Au•••Au interaction was effectually precluded by the introduction of the bulky diphosphine ligands. The dicationic structure could also disfavour Au•••Au interactions due to Coulombic repulsion, although the authors do not comment on this. In 2016, Yagai et al. reported the new complex 410 with flexible triethylene glycol (TEG) side chains. 484 As shown in Fig. 109, before grinding complex 410 exhibited structured emission peaks at 427 and 452 nm. Upon grinding of 410 for only 1 s, yellow emission with  max at 564 nm appeared. Further repeated grinding of 410 gave green emission with  max at 536 nm. Polarized optical microscopy (POM) revealed three different phases of 410 during the grinding process. As shown in Fig. 110, the green-emitting and blue-emitting phases were found in a birefringence crystalline domain, which is characteristic of a crystalline state. However, no birefringence was presented in the yellow-emitting phase, indicating an amorphous state. These results indicated that the MCL mechanism of 410 was attributed to a rare crystal-to-crystal transformation mediated by a transient amorphous state. In 2014, three dinuclear Au(I) complexes 411-413 bearing glycol bridges of different lengths were reported by Liang et al. 485 All complexes showed obvious AIE properties in different solvent-water mixtures. However, in the solid state, 411-413</p>

The PLQYs of ground 411-413 are 67.5%, 44.9% and 31%, respectively.

        <p>The first example of an Ir(III) complex with MCL properties was reported by our group in 2012. 453 Since then, various mono-and dinuclear Ir(III) complexes with MCL have been developed. 50,109,110,463,[486][487][488][489][490][491][492][493] Interestingly, in most of the cases, AIE and MCL activity are observed simultaneously. This is consistent with the opinion first expressed by Chi"s group, that AIE materials may be a key treasure source for mechanochromic luminescence. 445 There are four different types of MCL Ir(III) complexes based on the structure of the ancillary ligand, including alkyl chains, [486][487][488][489][490][491] dendrimer-like, 492 Schiff base 50,109,110 and rigid aromatic ring. 463,493 Fig. 111 The chemical structures of dinuclear Ir(III) complexes.The first example of an Ir(III) complex with MCL properties was reported by our group in 2012. 453 Since then, various mono-and dinuclear Ir(III) complexes with MCL have been developed. 50,109,110,463,[486][487][488][489][490][491][492][493] Interestingly, in most of the cases, AIE and MCL activity are observed simultaneously.

        <p>In contrast to mononuclear Ir(III) complexes, dinuclear Ir(III) analogues with MCL properties are very rare. Only four examples are known, namely complexes 7, 8, 11 and 12, all with Schiff base bridging ligands, reported by our group (Figure 111). 50,109,110 The ionic complexes 7 and 8 show faint emission in dilute solution, while bright orange emission with  max at 612 nm and 627 nm, respectively, was observed in the solid state, 50 indicating their AIE nature. Upon grinding, both 7 and 8 exhibited obvious MCL behaviour with a red-shift of the emission by ca. 20 nm to λ max 635 nm and 648 nm, respectively. This emission change can be rapidly reversed to the original emission by exposure of the ground samples to CH 2 Cl 2 vapour due to the vapour-induced recrystallization. Based on detailed single-crystal structure analysis and XRD measurements, it was proposed that phase transformations from the crystalline to the amorphous state occurred in the grinding process and the flexible imine units of the bridging ligand play key a role in achieving simultaneous AIE and MCL properties. Taking advantage of the AIE and reversible MCL of complex 8, a rapidly re-writable phosphorescence data recording device was successfully constructed (Fig. 112). In 2017, two new neutral dinuclear Ir(III) complexes 11 and 12 were presented by our group. 109,110 Similar to the previous ionic complexes 7 and 8, both 11 and 12 exhibit AIE and MCL properties simultaneously. These combined properties of 11 were exploited in the design of a simple, convenient and efficient technology for optical data encryption and decryption. As shown in Fig. 113a, in the encryption stage, the characters "NENU" were written on a filter paper with an orange-emitting fluorescent material selected from the literature as MASK. Next a sample of ground 11 (abbreviated as G) that showed a similar emission color to the Mask was carefully spread on the paper with the letters "AIPE". Under UV irradiation, the emission from G was hidden by the Mask with an identified orange emission. In the decryption stage, when DCM solvent was sprayed onto the as-prepared letters "NENU", the intense yellow security letters "AIPE" appeared, originating from the emission of unground complex 11. This reversible encryption and decryption cycle was performed several times. This work suggested that AIE and MCL-active Ir(III) complexes are promising candidates in the practical applications of anti-counterfeit and optical data encryption.In contrast to mononuclear Ir(III) complexes, dinuclear Ir(III) analogues with MCL properties are very rare.

        <p>Furthermore, taking advantages of mechanochromic and vapochromic properties of complex 12, a device for detecting volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was fabricated. As shown in Fig. 113b, the ground complex 12 gave no obvious response to low polarity organic vapors, showing only faint emission. However, remarkably enhanced emission was observed when 12 was treated with various low polarity organic vapors. The device can be reversibly switched between the ON or OFF states via organic vapor fumigation and grinding processes, due to the phase transformations between the crystalline and amorphous states.Furthermore, taking advantages of mechanochromic and vapochromic properties of complex 12, a device for detecting volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was fabricated.

        <p>In 2015, a Zn(II)-salen helical complex 414 (Fig. 114a) was reported by Mizukami et al. 494 As shown in Fig. 114b, the crystals of 414 exhibited intense green emission, while light-blue emission was observed after crushing the crystals into a powder (Fig. 114c). This MCL behaviour was assumed to be the result of a crystal phase transition with the blue-shifted emission attributed to weakened intermolecular π-π interactions. In 2016, a dinuclear Pt(II) complex 415 with bis-salen ligands and an isobutenylene linker (Fig. 115) was reported by Achira et al. 495 The crystals of 415 exhibited intense yellow emission (Fig. 115d) which is similar to its mononuclear analogue (Fig. 115a). Upon crushing, crystals of both mono and dinuclear complexes showed enhanced intensity of emission, but without any color change (Fig. 115b ande). However, when the crushed microcrystals were smeared into thin films on a glass slide, complex 415 exhibited an obvious color change from yellow to orange (Fig. 115f) whereas no change in emission was observed for its mononuclear analogue (Fig. 115c). These data indicate that dinuclear complex 415 exhibits enhanced pressure sensitivity which the authors suggest to arises from the introduction of the semiflexible linker, which contributes to the fragility of the molecular packing in the crystals of 415 under shear stress. 116). 496 Crystal structure analysis revealed a co-crystal comprising two molecules of 417a and one molecule of 417b. The crystals of the acetonitrile-free complexes 418 and 419 were obtained by slow vapor diffusion of diethyl ether into a solution of heated 416 and 417 in a mixed solvent (CH 3 OH/acetone and CH 3 OH/ether, respectively). The as-prepared 418 showed a red-shifted emission spectrum with a higher PLQY of 93%, when compared with 416, 417 and 419. These properties were attributed to the strong intramolecular cuprophilic interaction of 418 in the triplet excited states. Upon grinding (Fig. 117), 416-419 exhibited an obvious color change (with a red-shift of the emission of 20-28 nm). XRD results indicated that a phase transformation from the crystalline to the amorphous state occurred in the grinding process.

        <p>In this review, we have summarized recent advances in dinuclear metal complexes and their applications. Many of the studies have been motivated by exploring their fundamental structural and optoelectronic properties. Early work focussed on dinuclear analogues of the paradigmatic Ru(II) complex [Ru(bpy) 3 ] 2+ . Research then extended to a wide range of other metals, such as Re(I), Rh(III), Ir(III), Pt(II), Au(I), Os(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) in combination with a vast array of tailored ligands. Importantly, as a result of judicious molecular design (and some serendipity) many bimetallic complexes are now known to display specific photophysical properties and enhanced device performance exceeding that of their mononuclear metal complexes. These recent exciting findings should encourage chemists to further explore bimetallic chemistry. Moreover, this review article has systematically discussed the relationships between electronic structures and luminescent properties, which provide insights into the excited state character and intramolecular electron or energy transfer process in these complexes. However, it remains difficult to predict the charge transfer mechanism in a di-or poly-nuclear complex based on current knowledge. There is still no universal rule to explain the accurate structure-property relationships of different kinds of dinuclear metal complexes in all their diverse applications. Ongoing systematic variation of molecular structures allows the detailed investigation of the effects of bridge distance, energy gap and conformation on electronic coupling. These factors will promote future investigations into the photoinduced electron and energy transfer processes, and the development of molecular-based devices. Thus, the field is wide open for the rational design of new luminescent bimetallic systems with fine-tuned and desirable physical and chemical properties. Further breakthroughs can be anticipated in the fields of OLEDs, photocatalytic water splitting and CO 2 reduction, DSPEC, chemosensors, biosensors, PDT and smart materials.In this review, we have summarized recent advances in dinuclear metal complexes and their applications.

        <p>(i) Non-doped organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). While OLEDs based on transition metal emitters via host-guest doping methods have been extensively exploited, the development of non-doped OLEDs is still highly desired due to their easier preparation, superior reproducibility of manufacture, lack of unwanted host-guest interactions and potentially enhanced device stability. The combined advantages of AIE and excellent phosphorescent/TADF properties from dinuclear metal complexes, should lead to highly efficient and stable non-doped OLEDs. In contrast to mononuclear metal complexes, the larger size of di-or multinuclear metal complexes not only reduces intermolecular triplet-triplet annihilation, but also retards the attack ofnucleophiles on the complex, which is believed to be the reason for the higher stability of the devices. 503,504 In addition, design and synthesis of new AIE-acitve dinuclear metal complexes with bipolar characters via decoration of cyclometalated ligands or bridging ligands may further facilitate improved device efficiency.(i) Non-doped organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).

        <p>(ii) Photodynamic therapy (PDT) under hypoxia. Currently, PDT investigations are mainly performed under normoxia conditions where oxygen supply is sufficient, which is the opposite to hypoxic solid tumor cells. 441 Therefore, development of new photosensitizers for efficient PDT under hypoxia is of great significance. Because of the strong SOC accompanied with good ability to generate triplet excitons, transition metal complexes possess superior oxygen sensitivity. However, most luminescent transition metal complexes usually suffer from ACQ in the aggregated state, which greatly limits the production of triplet excitons. Therefore, AIE-active materials are ideal candidates. In contrast to the mononuclear species, di-or multi-nuclear AIE-active transition metal complexes may be a better choice due to their enhanced SOC and triplet exciton generation derived from the introduction of another metal atom in the molecule. Furthermore, easily obtained long wavelength emission in dinuclear species has great potential applications in deep tissue imaging therapy.(ii) Photodynamic therapy (PDT) under hypoxia.
