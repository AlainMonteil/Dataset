        <p>Antibiotic residues in water are general health and environmental risks due to the antibiotic-resistance phenomenon. Sonication has been included among the advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) used to remove recalcitrant contaminants in aquatic environments. Sonochemical processes have shown substantial advantages, including cleanliness, safety, energy savings and either negligible or no secondary pollution. This review provides a wide overview of the different protocols and degradation mechanisms for antibiotics that either use sonication alone or in hybrid processes, such as sonication with catalysts, Fenton and Fenton-like processes, photolysis, ozonation, etc.Antibiotic residues in water are general health and environmental risks due to the antibiotic-resistance phenomenon.

        <p>Antibiotics were first discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming and the term was first used in 1942 by Waksman and his collaborators [1,2]. Initially, the classical definition of antibiotics was: chemotherapeutic agents that can eradicate or restrain the growth of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi or protozoa [3][4][5]. Antibiotics have been widely used for the treatment of infectious diseases in humans and animals to the present day [4]. Macrolides, β-lactams, quinolones, tetracyclines, and sulfonamides are the most consumed antibiotics (Table S1) [6]. Since the 1990 s, however, antibiotic residues have been broadly observed in aqueous matrices and soil as well as in microorganism, animal and human bodies over the world thanks to the appearance of the advance analytical technologies [5,6].Antibiotics were first discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming and the term was first used in 1942 by Waksman and his collaborators [1,2].

        <p>The presence of antibiotic residues in the environment can either be caused by their continuous discharge or inherent high persistence [7]. For example, CEFX and CTX have attained extremely high level in urban wastewater samples in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, South China [8]. 11 antibiotics in hospital wastewater and sewage treatment plants (STPs) have been identified in Beijing, China. Fluoroquinolones, in particular, were found to be the most abundant, with a highest concentration of 16.8 µg/L in the hospital samples. The maximum concentrations of antibiotics in STPs and hospital wastewater were 1-3 orders of magnitude higher than those in the surface water from the Wenyu River and groundwater [9].The presence of antibiotic residues in the environment can either be caused by their continuous discharge or inherent high persistence [7].

        <p>Antibiotic concentrations in wastewater and environmental water bodies are obviously correlated with variations in annual consumption data [10]. Some antibiotics, such as penicillins, are easily degraded, whereas others, such as fluoroquinolones (e.g. CIP), macrolides (e.g. TYL) and tetracyclines, are considerably more persistent, resulting in their residues being found in the environment, spreading and accumulating in organisms [10]. Antibiotic occurrence in water is generally in the range of a few to hundreds ng/L [3,5,6,10]. For examples, 77 antibiotics have been reported in Danjiangkou Reservoir in China, but most were present at lower than 5.0 ng/L and SMX was the most abundant one [11]. 22 antibiotics, including eight quinolones, nine sulfonamides and five macrolides, have been detected in the Huangpu River in Shanghai, China, where the concentration of sulfonamides was in the range of 34-859 ng/L [12]. Sulfonamides (0.86-1563 ng/L) were also found to be the dominant antibiotics in Baiyangdian Lake, China [13]. 9 antibiotics, including sulfonamides, tetracyclines, quinolones and macrolides, have been investigated in 6 urban rivers in Guangzhou, South China. NOR was the most abundant followed by CIP, and the highest concentration was 2702 ng/L [14]. The concentrations of 4 quinolone antibiotics, OFX, NOR, CIP and EF, ranged from 3.49 to 660.13 ng/L in the Qingshitan reservoir, South China [15]. In addition, according to Ghernaout, et al. [8], an elevated number of antibiotics, made up of sulfonamides, trimethoprim and macrolides, was found in Japanese urban rivers.Antibiotic concentrations in wastewater and environmental water bodies are obviously correlated with variations in annual consumption data [10].

        <p>As a side effect of antibiotic use, antibiotic-resistance genes and antibiotic-resistant bacteria may be formed in microorganisms, causing a significant threat to human health and ecological safety [5,10,16]. For example, OXA-resistant bacteria are currently a serious problem in Latin American hospitals [17]. Meanwhile, other adverse effects, such as endocrine disruption and aquatic toxicity, can also destroy ecosystems [16].As a side effect of antibiotic use, antibiotic-resistance genes and antibiotic-resistant bacteria may be formed in microorganisms, causing a significant threat to human health and ecological safety [5,10,16].

        <p>Biological degradation, adsorption, reverse osmosis, ion exchange and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), including ozonation, photocatalysis, electrochemical degradation, non-thermal plasma, Fenton/ photo-Fenton reaction, sonochemical degradation, and combination, have been extensively studied as means to remove antibiotics from aqueous matrices [5,[23][24][25][26]. Biological processes are widely used in industrial effluent treatments with large effluent flow rates, but the high concentration of pollutants in effluents with high toxicity are recalcitrant to the microorganisms, resulting in limited antibiotic removal efficiency (RE) [5]. High-concentration antibiotics can be transported from water matrices onto solid adsorbents via adsorption, but the loaded adsorbents must be subsequently treated, causing higher treatment costs [27,28]. Reverse osmosis has been used to remove antibiotics with larger molecules, it can efficient to reduce levels of dissolved salts. However, with this process, the contaminants are slowly concentrated rather than removed. Besides, the deterioration/fouling of the membrane structure caused by high-concentration compounds is another drawback. Therefore, frequent back-washing and regeneration is required [5].Biological degradation, adsorption, reverse osmosis, ion exchange and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), including ozonation, photocatalysis, electrochemical degradation, non-thermal plasma, Fenton/ photo-Fenton reaction, sonochemical degradation, and combination, have been extensively studied as means to remove antibiotics from aqueous matrices [5,[23][24][25][26].

        <p>Due to the limitations of physical and biological processes, AOPs have gradually emerged as means for the degradation/mineralization of organic pollutants over recent decades [29,30]. As non-selective oxidation technologies, AOPs have attained the total removal of antibiotics, efficient reductions in toxicity and antimicrobial activity, and have also increased biodegradability [17,[30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37]. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as • O, • O 2-, • OH, • OOH, H 2 O 2 , etc., via various methods was the origin of AOPs [21,22,30,32,[38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47].Due to the limitations of physical and biological processes, AOPs have gradually emerged as means for the degradation/mineralization of organic pollutants over recent decades [29,30].

        <p>Hydroxyl radicals ( • OH) and other ROS are released by ozone (O 3 ) decomposition in water during the ozonation process. Meanwhile, O 3 often selectively reacts with nucleophilic molecules. However, the high costs of equipment, maintenance and operation, the high quantities of energy required, lower mass transfer, extreme pH-dependence and potential effluent ecotoxicity limit the application of ozonation [48,49]. Photocatalysis has often been applied under ambient conditions and may gain energy from sunlight with the advantages of simple operation and scale-up applicability, but it also suffers from mass-transfer limitations, and is affected by catalyst amount, light wavelength, radiation intensity, pH and water quality. Additionally, the catalysts consumed need to be specially treated or recycled, causing high overall costs [18][19][20][21][22]26]. Electrochemical degradation is an effective, versatile, costeffective, easy and clean technology, and is suitable for the treatment of toxic wastewater that contains high-concentration antibiotics and COD. However, the RE depends on the nature and structure of the electrode material, electrolyte composition, the applied current and the diffusion rates of substrates to the active sites of the anode. The low flow rates and high operating costs limit the application of electrochemical methods [5]. Non-thermal plasma generated in electrical discharges in liquid or at the gas-liquid interface leads to the formation of ROS and the power introduced into the plasma is very high, leading to low energy yields [23]. The Fenton reaction is usually used in homogeneous and heterogeneous systems and in conjugation with UV radiation to enhance the oxidation process. However, the narrow acidic pH range of the operation and dissolved catalysts limits this process [5].Hydroxyl radicals ( • OH) and other ROS are released by ozone (O 3 ) decomposition in water during the ozonation process.

        <p>Sonochemical degradation (sonolysis), namely, degradation that is driven or enhanced by sonication, emerged in the 1990 s. Ultrasound (US) is sound that exceeds the human hearing range, and has a wide frequency range of 18 kHz to 500 MHz [36,44,[50][51][52][53]. Ultrasonic propagation, with cycles of compression and rarefaction, causes acoustic cavitation phenomena, which is defined as the sonochemical origin [51,[54][55][56][57][58][59][60]. Such numerous cavitation bubbles are also referred to as microreactors, since they act as the centre of chemical reactions [44,61]. Gas-filled cavitation bubbles grow and extensively implode under the positive pressure that occurs during the compression cycle of US in water bulk [36,44,50,51,53]. Meanwhile, enormous local temperatures (ca. 5000 K) and high pressures (ca. 500 atm), microjets and shockwaves are produced [29,62,63]. Subsequently, ROS are produced through the pyrolysis of water molecules at the collapsing bubbles (hotspots), and oxidize the substrates in water [44,50]. Among these formed ROS, • OH is a significantly important, very strong and nonspecific oxidizing species [44,50,53]. Besides, hydrophobic volatile compounds also suffer thermal decomposition at hotspots, and both the above actions contribute to the degradation of organic contaminants [64][65][66].Sonochemical degradation (sonolysis), namely, degradation that is driven or enhanced by sonication, emerged in the 1990 s.

        <p>In theory, a large variety of organic pollutants are capable of being degraded by sonication without additional chemicals. Thus, sonication is usually seen as a green and safe technique to perform wastewater treatment. However, the sonolysis of organic contaminants has limited efficiency and consumes considerable amounts of energy [44,[67][68][69]. To improve the RE and reduce energy consumption, sonication-based combinations, such as sonocatalysis [70][71][72], Sono/Fenton [19,21,34,42,43,[73][74][75][76], sonication-ozonation (Sonozonation) [77][78][79][80], sonication-persulfate (Sono/PS) [81], sonophotocatalysis (Sono/Photo) [30,38,[82][83][84], sonoelectrochemical degradation [85][86][87], sonicationmicrowaves [88], sonication-hydrodynamic cavitation [89], and ultrasound-assisted biological processes [90][91][92], have attracted great attention.In theory, a large variety of organic pollutants are capable of being degraded by sonication without additional chemicals.

        <p>This review aims to provide an overview, and evaluate the REs, of the degradation of antibiotics in aqueous matrices by various sonochemical processes, including sonication alone [30,35,40,45,68,70,[93][94][95][96][97][98][99], sonocatalysis [34,39,71,74,[100][101][102][103][104][105][106][107][108][109], Sono/Fenton [21,22,31-34, 42,43,110-112], Sono/PS, Sono/Photo [30,38,[82][83][84][113][114][115][116][117][118], sonozonation [77][78][79]119,120], etc., and will focus on the degradation mechanisms and influence of operating conditions indicated in appriopriate studies that have been published in the last few years.This review aims to provide an overview, and evaluate the REs, of the degradation of antibiotics in aqueous matrices by various sonochemical processes, including sonication alone [30,35,40,45,68,70,[93][94][95][96][97][98][99], sonocatalysis [34,39,71,74,[100][101][102][103][104][105][106][107][108][109], Sono/Fenton [21,22,31-34, 42,43,110-112], Sono/PS, Sono/Photo [30,38,[82][83][84][113][114][115][116][117][118], sonozonation [77][78][79]119,120], etc., and will focus on the degradation mechanisms and influence of operating conditions indicated in appriopriate studies that have been published in the last few years.</p>
        <p>In general, sonochemical degradation occurs in three reaction zones relative to the collapsing cavitation bubbles: inside the cavitation bubbles; in the interfacial region between cavitation bubbles and the bulk solution; and in the bulk solution [5,10,44]. Inside and around the collapsing cavitation bubbles, the thermal dissociation of water molecules and oxygen occurs to release ROS [44,121,122]. Moreover, hydrophobic volatile compounds around the hotspots are also thermally decomposed [44,[61][62][63]. Hydrophilic and non-volatile compounds, such as LEV [41], that remain in the bulk solutions are oxidized by ROS. The sonochemical reaction with • OH has been speculated to occur at the cavitation interface, where the maximum • OH concentration is present [41]. Only ca. 10% of the radicals created in the interfacial region diffuse or escape to the bulk liquid [40]. Therefore, antibiotic degradation is strongly dependent on the distance between non-volatile P. Liu et al. antibiotic molecules and the cavitation bubbles, and this distance is determined by hydrophobicity [40,41,44].In general, sonochemical degradation occurs in three reaction zones relative to the collapsing cavitation bubbles: inside the cavitation bubbles; in the interfacial region between cavitation bubbles and the bulk solution; and in the bulk solution [5,10,44].

        <p>Figure S1 clearly shows the HPLCs of SMZ degradation and the appearance of intermediates with sonication time. In addition, LC/MS/ MS analyses have indicated that the sonolytic degradation of SMZ is mainly ascribed to OH oxidation. The sonolytic degradation pathway of SMZ is shown in Scheme 1. As can be seen, SMZ is first oxidized by • OH radicals, resulting in the formation of (OH)SMZ and the cleavage of the N-S bond [40]. 4,6-dimethylpyrimidin-2-amine, sulfanilic acid and the mono-hydroxyl derivative of sulfanilic acid are probably produced by the cleavage of the N-S bond of SMZ or (OH)SMZ. The mono-hydroxyl derivative of sulfanilic acid may also be formed by the • OH radical that directly attacks the sulfanilic acid. Aniline is an intermediate product in SMZ degradation via the breakage of the C-S bond in SMZ or sulfanilic acid, and can be oxidized to phenol [40].Figure S1 clearly shows the HPLCs of SMZ degradation and the appearance of intermediates with sonication time.

        <p>However, the sonochemical degradation products were rarely mineralized. About 100% of 180 μM SMZ was decomposed, but only 8.31% TOC was reduced by sonication for 2 h at 800 kHz and 100 W.However, the sonochemical degradation products were rarely mineralized.

        <p>Fortunately, the effluent became much more biodegradable (BOD 5 /COD was increased from 0.04 to 0.45), indicating that the toxicity of the effluent to microorganisms was obviously reduced [40].Fortunately, the effluent became much more biodegradable (BOD 5 /COD was increased from 0.04 to 0.45), indicating that the toxicity of the effluent to microorganisms was obviously reduced [40].</p>
        <p>Extensive investigation with the addition of a radical scavenger, such as isopropyl alcohol, ethanol, methanol [40], n-butanol [96], terephthalate (TA) and Suwannee River Fulvic Acid (SRFA) (Scheme 1) [123], has revealed that reaction with • OH is the main degradation route for antibiotics during sonication [40,96,123,124]. For example, with a hydrophobic character in the whole pH range, n-butanol diffuses to the gas/liquid interface of the microbubbles where it is able to scavenge • OH and quench the antibiotic degradation as a consequence [96]. In the presence of TA, CIP (a hydrophilic compound) degradation was inhibited by a factor of 40-1500 depending on the frequency and initial concentration, while degradation was slightly affected by SRFA [123]. TA reacts with • OH in bulk solution and accumulates around cavitation bubbles, greatly quenching • OH, while SRFA stays in bulk solution and catches • OH and competes with CIP [123].Extensive investigation with the addition of a radical scavenger, such as isopropyl alcohol, ethanol, methanol [40], n-butanol [96], terephthalate (TA) and Suwannee River Fulvic Acid (SRFA) (Scheme 1) [123], has revealed that reaction with • OH is the main degradation route for antibiotics during sonication [40,96,123,124].

        <p>In addition, the inhibition of DXC degradation via the addition of a radical scavenger (2-propanol or glucose) was observed [95]. DXC degradation was not affected significantly when low-or high-concentration glucose (high hydrophilicity) and low-concentration 2propanol (miscible with water) were individually added. It was speculated that both glucose and low-concentration 2-propanol are dissolved in the bulk liquid far away from the bubbles, while DXC is relatively closer to the cavitation bubbles. As a result, no competing reactions between glucose or 2-propanol with • OH occurred around the hotspots. However, a significant decrease in the DXC degradation rate was observed in the presence of a high concentration of 2-propanol due to its relatively high volatility [95]. Therefore, the addition of the radical scavengers confirmed that • OH-mediated reactions either occur at the interface of the cavitation bubbles, or in the bulk liquid depending on the properties of the antibiotics [64,96]. Unreacted • OH will be recombined into H 2 O 2 , for example, 77.6 and 57.3 μM of H 2 O 2 have been observed as being generated after 30 min sonication in the presence of AMP and NAF, respectively [68].In addition, the inhibition of DXC degradation via the addition of a radical scavenger (2-propanol or glucose) was observed [95].

        <p>Under sonication, the degradation of antibiotics mostly occurs via radical reactions in the bulk liquid and generally follows pseudo-first order (PFO) kinetics [37,68,95,98]. The degradation rate and RE of antibiotics are dependent on many factors, such as US frequency [35,41,96,128], power [35,95,96], and sonication mode (continuous or pulse) [69], chemical structure and physicochemical properties [128,130], initial concentration [35,128,130], solution volume [35,68,131], pH value [37,96], temperature [32,39,110,124], and sonication time [35,128,130,131], etc. The influence of the critical parameters on the sonochemical degradation of antibiotics is discussed below.Under sonication, the degradation of antibiotics mostly occurs via radical reactions in the bulk liquid and generally follows pseudo-first order (PFO) kinetics [37,68,95,98].

        <p>As summarized in Table 1, the radical reactions that take place in the bulk liquid dominate antibiotic degradation, while more reactive radicals are formed at higher ultrasonic frequencies, e.g., 300-1000 kHz, than at lower frequencies, e.g. 20-45 kHz [53,67]. Therefore, higher REs for SDZ at 580 kHz and 22 W [96], and for AMP at 375 kHz and 24.4 W (actual ultrasonic powers, determined by calorimetric method) [45] have been observed. Al-Hamadani, et al. have investigated the degradation of SMX by sonication in the absence of catalysts [70]. The removal of 10 μM SMX was higher at 1000 kHz sonication for 60 min (72%, 160 nmol/min of removal rate) than at 28 kHz sonication (33%, 55 nmol/min of removal rate), while all other experimental conditions remained the same (0.18 W/mL of US power density at pH 7 and 15 • C in 1000 mL solutions), because more • OH were generated at 1000 kHz than at 28 kHz [70]. In addition, 187.29 nmol (90%) SDZ was removed per minute in 250 mL of 0.1 mM aqueous SDZ solutions for 120 min under 580 kHz sonication at 30 • C and pH 5.5, whereas 41.7 nmol (82%) AMP was removed per minute in 250 mL of 0.03 mM aqueous AMP solutions after 180 min under 375 kHz sonication at 20 • C and pH 6.5.As summarized in Table 1, the radical reactions that take place in the bulk liquid dominate antibiotic degradation, while more reactive radicals are formed at higher ultrasonic frequencies, e.g., 300-1000 kHz, than at lower frequencies, e.g. 20-45 kHz [53,67].

        <p>It has been demonstrated that the initial degradation rate of pollutants exhibited good correlation with LogP (Octanol-water partition coefficient, i.e., the hydrophobicity). Thus, the fast elimination of penicillins is attributed to their high hydrophobicity, leading to the accumulation of penicillins near cavitation bubbles, compared to fluoroquinolones or cephalosporins [128]. In addition, Lastre-Acosta, et al. have indicated that the sonochemical degradation mechanism of SDZ is directly related to the pKa-dependent speciation of SDZ molecules [96]. Moreover, small-sized molecules (molar volumes&lt;130 mL/mol) more quickly diffuse to bubble interfaces and are impacted most by pulsing US, resulting in a higher portion of the antibiotic in and around cavitation bubbles.

        <p>The effect of pH value on antibiotic degradation is also related to the properties of antibiotics (i.e., ionic species or molecule states). Some antibiotics are more sophisticated, being zwitterions (a molecule containing both a basic and an acidic group). For example, LEV has two different acid-dissociation constant values (pKa 5.7 and 7.9) [123]. De Bel, et al. have explored the effect of pH on CIP sonolysis at 520 kHz [37]. The k 1 value (0.021 min -1 ) at pH 3 is almost 4-fold higher than those at pH 7 (0.0058 min -1 ) and pH 10 (0.0069 min -1 ). The solution can even be considered readily biodegradable after sonication at pH 3 (BOD 5 /COD &gt; 0.4) [37]. Degradation is clearly faster when the main part of the CIP molecules carries an overall positive charge. These positively charged molecules will accumulate at the negatively charged liquid-bubble interface, where the concentration of ROS and the reaction temperature are higher. Hence, degradation is faster [37]. Similarly, Villegas-Guzman, et al. have found that the highest sonolysis of DXC was achieved under 600 kHz sonication at pH = 3 [95]. Acidic media also favour the sonochemical degradation of DXC (pH = 3.0) [18,129], LEV (pH = 5.9) [41], SDZ (pH = 5.5) [96], and TNZ (pH = 3.0) [99], etc. By contrast, Wang, et al. have reported that the TC degradation rate is highly pH-dependent, and that higher pH values favour TC degradation under sonication, due to the transformation of TC molecules at different pH values [98].The effect of pH value on antibiotic degradation is also related to the properties of antibiotics (i.e., ionic species or molecule states).

        <p>Generally, the degradation rate of antibiotics increases with increasing temperature [32,39,124]. The influence of temperature on the sonodegradation of antibiotics is complicated. As far as we know, high temperature usually results in a high solvent vapour pressure, followed by the formation of more water-vapour-containing cavitation bubbles, causing the cavitation bubbles to collapse less violently, which leads to reduced • OH production. However, the reduction of the viscosity and surface tension at high temperatures leads to a low threshold intensity for cavitation, which can increase the number of cavitation bubbles, and then promote the generation of • OH and HOO • . Moreover, the strengthened reactions of the hydroxyl radicals and mass transfer at high temperatures are favourable to the removal of antibiotics [32,39,110,124]. According to De Bel et al., increased temperature (15-45 • C) leads to faster CIP degradation (k 1 was increased from 0.0055 to 0.0105 min -1 ). The low apparent activation energy (17.5 kJ/ mol) suggests that the degradation of CIP is diffusion controlled (usually in the range of 12-15 kJ/mol) [124]. Higher temperature (in the range of 30-60 • C) facilitates the removal of FLU by the Sono/H 2 O 2 process [110]. 3% of FLU was removed from 200 mL of 1 mM aqueous FLU solutions for 120 min under 40 kHz and 120 W sonication at 60 • C and pH 4 in the presence of 20 mM H 2 O 2 . The activation energy for the degradation of FLU was 6.510 kJ/mol [110].Generally, the degradation rate of antibiotics increases with increasing temperature [32,39,124].

        <p>In general, low concentrations of antibiotics favour their sonochemical degradation; RE decreases with increasing initial concentration [18,30,35,40,68,[93][94][95][96][97][98][99]. The degradation of antibiotics is limited by the available surface at the bubble-liquid interface. According to the Arrhenius law, for example, the apparent activation energy for the sonochemical degradation of CIP has been determined to be 17.5 kJ/ mol, which suggests that the degradation of CIP is diffusion controlled. A Langmuir-type heterogeneous-reaction-kinetics model could be used to explain why the k 1 value increases with decreasing initial CIP concentration from 0.0204 min -1 (C 0 : 0.15 mg/L) to 0.0009 min -1 (C 0 : mg/L).

        <p>Antibiotics can be degraded to a certain degree by sonication alone, but the REs of non-volatile compounds are somewhat lower and degradation is really time consuming. For example, it has been observed that only 30% DXC was degraded after 8 h [95], and most antibiotics were converted into hydrophilic organics rather than CO 2 [17]. Although the BOD 5 /COD ratio (biodegradability) noticeably increased, e.g., from 0 to 0.36, after the sonochemical degradation of CPX [126], the mineralization of antibiotics is challenging even after a long period of sonication [18,97,126,127]. For example, 180 μM SMZ was almost fully removed, but only 8.31% TOC was reduced by sonication at kHz and 100 W in 2 h [40]. Therefore, a great deal of effort has been devoted to enhancing sonolysis to increase the RE, with an eye on practical applications, using simple additives, such as noble gas Argon (Ar), anions, CCl 4 , H 2 O 2 , etc. in the sonication system.Antibiotics can be degraded to a certain degree by sonication alone, but the REs of non-volatile compounds are somewhat lower and degradation is really time consuming.

        <p>Due to Ar's physical properties (e.g. solubility, thermal conductivity and specific heat ratio), an Ar atmosphere favours sonolytic activity compared to diatomic gases [35,108]. Gao, et al. have reported that the sonolytic degradation of SMZ is accelerated in the presence of Ar or O 2 , but inhibited by N 2 [40]. Meanwhile, the SMZ degradation rate was slightly inhibited by NO -3 , Cl -and SO 2- 4 , which is consistent with the sonochemical degradation of TC [98], but significantly improved by HCO -3 and Br - [40]. The enhancement of TC degradation by adding HCO -3 has also been demonstrated [98], while a negligible influence was observed when adding mannitol or calcium carbonate during the sonochemical degradation of OXA at a high frequency in wastewater (from a municipal wastewater treatment plant) [127]. In another sonication system, KI and H 2 O 2 were used as an iodine source to enhance the RE of SMZ, and the RE value increased from 3.4% to 85.1% under min sonication with 0.04 mM SMZ, 2.4 mM KI and 120 mM H 2 O 2 at W US under acidic conditions. I • and I 2-• radicals were the most predominant active species. The activation energy of SMZ degradation was calculated to be 7.75 ± 0.61 kJ/mol (15-55 • C), which indicates that the reaction is potentially a diffusion-controlled process [97]. Furthermore, P.

The effect of adding H 2 O 2 to the sonochemical degradation of antibiotics has been summarized in Table 2.</p>
        <p>As seen in Table 2, the sonolysis of TC, LEV, NOR, MTZ, OFX and FLU, etc., has been conducted in a US-frequency range of (20-2400 kHz) and a US-power range of (9.5-750 W). Their REs are located in the range of 1.9-81.0%, under sonication alone, and 0-30%, under oxidation alone with 0.29-333.00 mM H 2 O 2 for 30-240 min. In some cases, significantly higher REs (5.9-93%) were given by sono/H 2 O 2 processes than in those performed with sonication alone, or oxidation with H 2 O 2 alone. In addition, COD was slightly removed, leading to increasing ratio of BOD 5 /COD.As seen in Table 2, the sonolysis of TC, LEV, NOR, MTZ, OFX and FLU, etc., has been conducted in a US-frequency range of (20-2400 kHz) and a US-power range of (9.5-750 W).

        <p>However, the addition of H 2 O 2 , used as a radical promoter, does not always promote sonication processes [20,31]. When sonication was applied without H 2 O 2 , degradation and mineralization (35.8 and 22.6%, respectively) were similar to the results obtained in sono/H 2 O 2 processes (36.5 and 24.4%, respectively) [31]. Therefore, excess H 2 O 2 can act as a • OH scavenger and decrease the RE of antibiotics, resulting in the presence of an optimal amount of H 2 O 2 for the sonochemical degradation of the target compounds.However, the addition of H 2 O 2 , used as a radical promoter, does not always promote sonication processes [20,31].

        <p>In addition, Serna-Galvis, et al. have reported the role of mechanical agitation in the removal of OXA (or AMP) via sonication [128], photo-Fenton, TiO 2 photo-electro [17,68,127], and sono-Fenton processes [45]. These results suggest that mechanical agitation is not required in the processes that involve sonication on the lab-scale [17,45,68,127,128]. The exception is the degradation of CIP in the US-assisted Laccase catalytic process, in which degradation increased from 8% to 50%, due to improved mass transfer, when the agitation speed was increased from 0 rpm to 200 rpm. However, no further enhancement in degradation efficiency was observed when the agitation speed was increased to 300 rpm [90].In addition, Serna-Galvis, et al. have reported the role of mechanical agitation in the removal of OXA (or AMP) via sonication [128], photo-Fenton, TiO 2 photo-electro [17,68,127], and sono-Fenton processes [45].

        <p>Moreover, although the application of sonication has been shown to be feasible on small scales, its use in large-scale treatment process is still a challenge because of high energy requirements [104]. Therefore, sonication has been combined with other additives (catalysts and persulfate) and other AOPs (Fenton reaction, photocatalysis, ozonation, etc.) to increase the RE, reduce reaction times and enhance mineralization [35,37]. These hybrid methods are discussed below.Moreover, although the application of sonication has been shown to be feasible on small scales, its use in large-scale treatment process is still a challenge because of high energy requirements [104].

        <p>The ability of sonication to enhance the heterogeneous catalytic degradation of antibiotics is discussed in this section, while the role of sonication in the homogeneous catalytic degradation of antibiotics, mainly Fenton reactions, will be discussed in the following section. In most cases, higher REs are obtained by sonocatalysis than the sum of those obtained under catalysis and sonication alone [39,43,70,101,102,105,108,133,134]. More importantly, antibiotics, such as TC, OTC, CTC and DTC, can be decomposed into a suite of nontoxic intermediates by sonocatalytic processes [135]. For example, GMF was first decomposed to aromatic and aliphatic intermediates in the early stage of reactions, and then mineralized to CO 2 , H 2 O and inorganic ions, leading to significant reductions in solution toxicity after the sonocatalytic degradation of GMF [102]. Similarly, a substantial reduction in the toxicity of an AMP solution has been observed after the sonocatalytic degradation of AMP with Zn(OH)F [100].The ability of sonication to enhance the heterogeneous catalytic degradation of antibiotics is discussed in this section, while the role of sonication in the homogeneous catalytic degradation of antibiotics, mainly Fenton reactions, will be discussed in the following section.

        <p>In an attempt to clarify the effects of sonication on heterogeneous catalysis, increased dispersion has been considered as a reason for the increased reaction rate. The removal of the passivating layer, the reduction of the catalyst particle size and enhanced interparticle collisions, all induced by cavitational shock waves and local turbulent microjets, may increase the number of active reaction sites on catalysts as well as increasing the contact area, improving mass transfer and minimizing fouling, which all result in increased catalytic activity [51].In an attempt to clarify the effects of sonication on heterogeneous catalysis, increased dispersion has been considered as a reason for the increased reaction rate.

        <p>In homogeneous systems, it is also critical to activate the catalyst and to keep it active during antibiotic degradation. Sonication can improve mass transfer, catalyst activation and the production of higher ROS concentrations, e.g., in Fenton reactions [76,136]. Organometallic compounds are often used for the homogeneous catalysis of various reactions. The starting organometallic compound, however, is often catalytically inactive until it loses the metal-bonded ligands (such as carbon monoxide) from the metal. Sonication can induce ligand dissociation, making the initiation of homogeneous catalysis by sonication practical. The transient, coordinatively unsaturated species produced from the sonolysis of metal carbonyls are likely candidates [36,51].In homogeneous systems, it is also critical to activate the catalyst and to keep it active during antibiotic degradation.

        <p>On the other hand, solid catalyst particles may increase the density of microbubbles, meaning that more ROS will be produced during bubbles collapse⋅H 2 O 2 formation is significantly increased due to the dispersion of catalysts under sonication, indicating that the dispersed catalyst particles can act as additional nuclei for the pyrolysis of water molecules and the formation of • OH [39]. As a result, increased radical transfer from cavitation bubbles to the interface and bulk solution is promoted, and with it the RE of antibiotics [36,51,125]. In homogeneous systems, catalysts, such as Fe 2+ , promote radical formation via the decomposition of H 2 O 2 , formed under sonication, to enhance and accelerate the degradation of antibiotics [136,137].

        <p>A ZnO-biochar nanocomposite has exhibited better sonocatalytic performance than biochar and ZnO nanorods because of its huge surface area, narrow band gap and enhanced cavitational phenomenon [102]. The enhancement in the adsorption capacity of sonocatalyst is caused by reducing electron and hole recombination using fluorine and enhancing the oxidation potential of the valence band of ZF1 (ZnO with F/Zn molar ratio of 1:1) compared to ZnO. The prepared Z-scheme KTaO 3 /FeVO 4 / Bi 2 O 3 sonocatalyst displayed much higher sonocatalytic activity in the sonocatalytic degradation of CEF sodium than Z-scheme KTaO 3 /Bi 2 O 3 [109]. This excellent sonocatalytic performance is attributed to the introduction of the FeVO 4 conductive channel in which the valence state changes of Fe and V provides driving force for e -transfer, which obviously enhances the sonocatalytic activity of KTaO 3 /Bi 2 O 3 [109].A ZnO-biochar nanocomposite has exhibited better sonocatalytic performance than biochar and ZnO nanorods because of its huge surface area, narrow band gap and enhanced cavitational phenomenon [102].

        <p>Al-Hamadani, et al. have investigated the effect of US frequency on the degradation of SMX via sonocatalysis with glass beads (GBs) and SWCNs [70]. The removal of SMX was enhanced significantly in the presence of GBs at 28 kHz, whereas it was significantly reduced at 1000 kHz as the GB particle size was similar to or larger than that of the cavitation bubbles at high frequency, leading to interference between the US and GB particles that resulted in a reduction in H 2 O 2 production [70]. Additionally, the presence of SWNTs was effective under low and high frequencies in both the sonochemical degradation mechanism and adsorption mechanism because the dispersed SWNT particles acted as additional nuclei for the pyrolysis of water molecules and the formation of more • OH. Moreover, the dispersion of SWNTs, due to sonication, enhanced the adsorption process by providing more adsorption sites, leading to increased adsorption capacity.

        <p>The influence of increased temperature on the degradation of antibiotics is exerted via: i) the cavitational intensity; ii) changes in the physicochemical properties of the antibiotics; and iii) the type of cavities formed [39]. An increased k 1 was observed for SMX with increased temperature (15-55 • C) in a sono/SWNT system. The low apparent activation energy values (7.28 kJ/mol) for SMX indicate that the degradation of SMX is influenced by diffusion. This is presumably because the degradation rate reflects the fact that the SMX molecule in the bulk solution moves to the gas-liquid interface region, where temperatures and • OH concentrations are high [39]. The removal rate for AZI increased with increasing temperature (20-40 • C) in the sono/ZnO system, especially from 20 to 40 • C.

The pH value is the most critical factor [73]. Yazdani, et al. have investigated the sonocatalytic degradation of AZI with ZnO, finding that H 2 O 2 addition significantly increased the RE of AZI from 90.6% to 98.4% [141]. H 2 O 2 addition also improved the sonocatalytic REs of RIF [108].

The enhancement of adding gases on RE is attributed to an increase in the number of nucleation sites in aqueous media, and enhancements in the pressure and temperature of collapsing cavitation bubbles [102].Seid-Mohammadi, et al. have investigated the removal of CFX from aqueous solutions using sono/H 2 O 2 /NiO process at 40 kHz.

        <p>On the other hand, inorganic and organic scavenging additives reduced the REs of antibiotics in sonocatalytic systems, indicating that • OH-mediation oxidation is responsible for the degradation of antibiotics, including SMX [70], CFZ [101], AMX [133], CIP [134], and TC [103,138]. For example, the RE of TC decreased by over 25% in the presence of tert-butanol [103]. The presence of isopropanol, KBr and NaN 3 sharply quenched a series of reactive oxygen species [138].

        <p>From the perspective of cost reduction and environmental protection, the recyclability of catalysts is essential to promoting sonocatalytic processes. In many cases, catalysts exhibited higher stability for the sonocatalytic degradation of antibiotics due to the strong ultrasonic surface cleaning [107]. Under sonication, catalysts can maintain their catalytic activity for antibiotic removal for 4-5 consecutive runs [72]. For example, the RE of AMP was reduced by only 5% even after Zn(OH)F was reused for four experiments [100].

        <p>Overall, sonocatalysis can significantly increase the RE of antibiotics compared with catalysis or sonication alone, but this process is still highly energy demanding and limited to laboratory-scale investigation at present. Thus, additional chemicals are required in many cases to improve the RE. To overcome the drawbacks and reduce the operating costs, a combination of sonication and other AOPs has been proposed to exploit the benefits of the synergistic effects of the AOPs [36].Overall, sonocatalysis can significantly increase the RE of antibiotics compared with catalysis or sonication alone, but this process is still highly energy demanding and limited to laboratory-scale investigation at present.

        <p>Fenton oxidation is one of the AOP techniques that has been most widely applied for antibiotic removal [17,[31][32][33][34]. So far, the Fenton processes that have been applied to the degradation of antibiotics can be divided into: classic homogeneous Fenton processes; and heterogeneous Fenton processes or Fenton-like processes. The classic Fenton reaction usually occurs in acidic homogeneous systems where Fe 2+ , or other metal ions (Cu 2+ , Zn 2+ , etc.), and H 2 O 2 exist simultaneously. By contrast, Fenton-like reactions generally occur in acidic heterogeneous systems where solid catalysts (Fe 0 , Fe 3 O 4 , etc.) and H 2 O 2 exist simultaneously.Fenton oxidation is one of the AOP techniques that has been most widely applied for antibiotic removal [17,[31][32][33][34].

On the other, adding the right amount of Fe 2+ (e.g., 1.0 mM) can also enhance Unfortunately, excessive H 2 O 2 and Fe 2+ negatively influence the degradation of antibiotics [18,33,95], since large doses of Fe 2+ and H 2 O 2 can act as scavengers for • OH in aqueous matrices [33,40,94,95].

        <p>The Fenton process requires a large amount of Fe 2+ and acidic conditions, which requires neutralization with alkaline, resulting in largescale sedimentation and high costs. With the development of Fentonlike technologies, the drawbacks of the conventional Fenton process have been overcome to some extent [43]. Fe 0 , Fe 3 O 4 particles and their nanoparticles are important catalysts to promote the decomposition of H 2 O 2 for the formation of • OH [21,22,32,42,43]. Unfortunately, the solid catalysts may be poisoned during Fenton reactions, nano-catalysts particles can aggregate and solid-catalyst passivation can occur, thus decreasing the degradation rate and limiting potential applications [21,22,32,118]. Therefore, sonication has been applied in the Fentonlike process to maintain the activity of catalysts and improve antibiotic removal.

As H 2 O 2 concentration increased from 1.5 to 15.0 mM, the RE of LEV increased until it reached a peak. The results are mainly related to the adsorption amount of H 2 O 2 onto the catalyst [42].

        <p>However, excessive amounts of H 2 O 2 adversely affected the REs [81], as the excess H 2 O 2 consumes the • OH formed in situ and inhibits iron corrosion. In the chemical reaction of • OH with the nanoparticle, hydroxyl ions are produced, which are less active than • OH and reduced system efficiency [21,22].However, excessive amounts of H 2 O 2 adversely affected the REs [81], as the excess H 2 O 2 consumes the • OH formed in situ and inhibits iron corrosion.

        <p>In general, the pH value can affect the surface-charge properties, adsorption behaviour and electron-transfer ability of the catalyst, which all affect catalytic degradation. Thus, it is necessary to study the effect of the pH value on RE and degradation kinetics in a wide range of pH conditions [43]. The acidic condition (pH 2-4) has been demonstrated to be suitable for the Fenton reaction. Gholami, et al. and Rahmani, et al. have investigated the effect of pH on the degradation of CLM and TNZ, using a sono/Fenton-like process with nanoscale Fe 0 [21,22]. Over the pH range of 3-9, the system had the highest efficiency under acidic conditions (pH 3), as Fe 0 corrosion and the reactivity of • OH were greatly influenced by H + concentration [21,22].In general, the pH value can affect the surface-charge properties, adsorption behaviour and electron-transfer ability of the catalyst, which all affect catalytic degradation.

        <p>condition. LEV exists as different species depending on pH value. At 5.7 ≤ pH ≤ 7.9, LEV mainly exists in its zwitterion form in solution, while at pH &gt; 7.9 and &lt; 5.7, LEV exists in its cationic or anionic form in solution, respectively. Therefore, the hydrophilicity and solubility of LEV at different pH values play the critical role in its oxidative degradation by • OH. In addition, pH value affects not only LEV adsorption onto the catalyst, but also the heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction on the catalyst surface. The enhanced degradation of LEV over the wide range 4.0 ≤ pH ≤ 8.0 occurred due to nucleation sites on the catalyst for the formation of cavities. At pH 9.0, the decrease of RE was partly due to the decrease in H 2 O 2 adsorption onto the catalyst, which was covered with Fe(OH) 3- 6 , and the self-decomposition of H 2 O 2 , resulting in the low availability of H 2 O 2 and a low yield of • OH [42].condition.

        <p>To effectively remove antibiotics from aqueous solutions using sono/ PS, PMS or Oxone, catalysts have been added to enhance RE [148,162]. For example, Fe 0 or PS alone cannot cause significant SDZ degradation, and sonication alone only led to marginal degradation of SDZ after 1 h treatment (9.7% RE). Moreover, the RE of SDZ reached only 9.8% and 13.7% in 1 h using a combination of two factors, such as sono/Fe 0 and sono/PS, respectively. By contrast, 45.5% of SDZ was removed in 1 h using the Fe 0 /PS combination due to the catalytic decomposition of PS by Fe 0 and higher SR formation. However, surface passivation prevented the dissolution of Fe 0 and the release of Fe 2+ , hampering the continuous degradation of SDZ. Therefore, sonication was used to remove the passivation film and improve mass transfer, inducing an SDZ RE of 95.7% in 1 h in the sono/Fe 0 /PS reaction system [75]. Similarly, it is also difficult to remove TC by sonication alone, or PS alone. Furthermore, little TC was removed with only the Fe 3 O 4 catalyst and even the catalyst with sonication due to the insignificant adsorption of TC onto Fe 3 O 4 and the inadequate formation of active radicals. However, the RE of TC increased greatly and reached 50.5% and 51.5% in 90 min using the Fe 3 O 4 /PS and sono/PS combinations, respectively, due to the activation of PS by the catalyst or sonication; the formation of more SR and • OH on the surface of catalyst. More significantly, the RE of TC reached 89% with sono/Fe 3 O 4 /PS since the activity of Fe 3 O 4 was maintained by sonication and PS was activated by Fe 3 O 4 and sonication simultaneously to produce more SR [148].To effectively remove antibiotics from aqueous solutions using sono/ PS, PMS or Oxone, catalysts have been added to enhance RE [148,162].

        <p>As shown in Scheme 4, sonication played important roles in the Fe 0 / PS system, including producing radicals, enhancing iron-corrosion reactions and accelerating the radical reactions in the bulk liquid [75,148]. The microstreaming or microjets, shockwaves, and turbulence generated by sonication promoted mixing at the solid-liquid interfaces and the continuous cleaning of the solid catalyst surface, which favour the above reactions [148]. Based on an HPLC-ESI-MS examination, oxidation by SR was the main SDZ degradation pathway, as shown in Scheme 5 [75]. The main degradation step was the oxidation of the amine group (α-position in the benzene ring) by SR to generate the nitro-SD derivatives. SR then further attacks the nitro-SD derivatives (the C-N bonds on the γ-position in the heterocyclic ring), leading to ring opening. Another degradation pathway was the direct oxidative cleavage of the S-N bond, and then the intermediate (4-[2-iminopyr-imidine-1(2H)-yl]aniline), which was formed via reaction between the products, 2-aminopyrimidine and sulfanilic acid. Furthermore, the low molecular weight organic acids (formate and acetate), inorganic ions (nitrate, nitrite and sulfate) were examined using an ion chromatograph, which demonstrated the mineralization of SDZ [75].

The main degradation step was the oxidation of the amine group (α-position in the benzene ring) by SR to generate the nitro-SD derivatives. SR then further attacks the nitro-SD derivatives (the C-N bonds on the γ-position in the heterocyclic ring), leading to ring opening. Another degradation pathway was the direct oxidative cleavage of the S-N bond, and then the intermediate (4-[2-iminopyr-imidine-1(2H)-yl]aniline), which was formed via reaction between the products, 2-aminopyrimidine and sulfanilic acid. Furthermore, the low molecular weight organic acids (formate and acetate), inorganic ions (nitrate, nitrite and sulfate) were examined using an ion chromatograph, which demonstrated the mineralization of SDZ [75]. Unfortunately, this study does not provide the variation of TOC and toxicity of the SDZ solutions by the treatment.</p>
        <p>Pan, et al. have investigated SMZ degradation in a pre-magnetized Fe 0 /PS process enhanced by sonication [160]. The stronger signals of the DMPO-SO 4 and DMPO-OH adducts illustrated that more SR and • OH radicals were produced in the system and that this occurred more quickly. Similarly, • OH played important roles in the degradation of TC by sonication with Fe 3 O 4 and PS. The oxidation of TC mainly took place on the surface of Fe 3 O 4 and the concentration of leaching iron during the reaction could be neglected [148].Pan, et al. have investigated SMZ degradation in a pre-magnetized Fe 0 /PS process enhanced by sonication [160].

        <p>So far, the sono/PS and PMS/catalyst processes have been extensively applied in antibiotic degradation. For example, the elimination of FLU was significantly accelerated and the RE increased when 1.0 mM PS was added to a sono/Fenton system. As a result, 98% of FLU elimination was achieved in 80 min [110]. Roy, et al. have investigated SDZ degradation in a sono/Fenton-like process with PS and yolk-shell Fe 3 O 4 @hollow@mSiO 2 nanoparticles [163]. The faster leaching of Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ ions from the metal core of the Fe 3 O 4 @hollow@mSiO 2 particles, due to micro-convection generated by sonication, enhanced SDZ degradation [163].So far, the sono/PS and PMS/catalyst processes have been extensively applied in antibiotic degradation.

        <p>Rahmani, et al. have reported the sonocatalytic degradation of CIP associated with PS and Zn 0 under 40 kHz and 350 W sonication [19]. With 4.4 mM PS and 1.84 mM Zn 0 at pH 4.5 for 60 min, the RE of CIP reached 55% under sono/Zn 0 /PS in 1 L of a 50 mg/L CIP solution, which was much higher than those (39.7, 18.5, 9.9, 7.5, 3.3 and 2.5%) obtained by PS/Zn 0 , sono/PS, sono/Zn 0 , PS, Zn 0 and sonication alone, respectively [19]. This indicates that the production of • OH, activation of PS and Zn 0 dispersion in solution were enhanced by sonication [19].

        <p>Besides the removal of antibiotics, the mineralization of antibiotic solutions can be significantly enhanced by sonication with PS, PMS and catalysts. Su, et al. have investigated the sonocatalytic degradation of AMX and the removal of COD with Co 2+ and Oxone [161]. The REs of COD were in the order of: Oxone &lt; Oxone/Co 2+ &lt; Sono/Oxone &lt; Sono/ Oxone/Co 2+ . Over 98% of COD removal was achieved by sonication with 20 kHz and 200 W at 24 • C for 60 min in the presence of 0.095 mM AMX and 0.025 mM Co 2+ [161]. Consequently, sonication reduced the energy barrier of the reaction and enhanced the COD removal of antibiotics [161]. The degradation of antibiotics by sonication with PS or PMS and catalysts has been summarized in Table 6. As shown in Table 6, 20-40 kHz US has usually been used to enhance the degradation of antibiotics via oxidation with a PS/Catalyst. CIP, NOR and CAP are difficult to oxidize, and their REs only reached 55.0%-68.5% under sono/PS/Catal after 60-240 min of treatment. By contrast, the REs of SDZ, TC and SMZ reached higher values (95.7%-98.3%) after 15-60 min of treatment. Importantly, all synergy factors fall over the range from 1.3 to 1.9. Meanwhile, mineralization can be achieved to a certain degree by sono/PS/Catal. For example, 50 mL of 0.1 mM AMX was sonicated with 20 kHz and 300 W US in the presence of 5 mM Oxone and 0.25 mM Co 2+ at pH 7 for 60 min, giving a RE of COD of 85%, which is higher than that (51%) of oxidation with 5 mM Oxone and 0.25 mM Co 2+ without sonication [161]. In addition, 89% of COD was removed as the RE of TC reached 93% under sono/PS/Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles [162].Besides the removal of antibiotics, the mineralization of antibiotic solutions can be significantly enhanced by sonication with PS, PMS and catalysts.

        <p>As shown in Table 6, the removal of antibiotics is highly pH dependent and acidic conditions favour the degradation of antibiotics by sono/PS and sono/PS/Catal [75,144,148]. Other factors, including US frequency, initial concentration of antibiotics, concentration of PS or PMS, contact time and temperature [75,130,158,159,161], are also important. Additives are also critical for antibiotic degradation under sonication with PS, PMS, Oxone, or/and catalyst [19,33,75,81,103,[110][111][112]130,139,144,[147][148][149][159][160][161][162].As shown in Table 6, the removal of antibiotics is highly pH dependent and acidic conditions favour the degradation of antibiotics by sono/PS and sono/PS/Catal [75,144,148].

        <p>The sonocatalytic degradation of antibiotics, such as TC [30], AMX [158,161], etc., with PS or PMS generally follows PFO kinetics [130]. For example, a k 1 value for 20 mg/L SDZ in a 400 mL solution was measured to be about 0.057 min -1 at pH 7 and room temperature under 20 kHz and 40 W sonication with 0.92 mM Fe 0 and 1.84 mM PS [75]. In general, initial antibiotic concentration, catalyst dosage, PS and PMS concentration, and the initial pH value of the solution, temperature and US frequency and power affect the degradation kinetics [111,130,148,159]. At lower US power ranges, the RE increased with increased US power [75,111,147,148,160], but the benefits of increasing US power over an optimal power value were not observed [148]. In addition, RE increased with an increase in temperature [130,159,161], while RE decreased with an increase of the initial antibiotic concentration [75,130,139,148,161,162]. However, the amount of antibiotics removed increased with increasing initial concentration. For example, 45.9, 88.9 and 121.9 mg/L TC were oxidized by sonication with Fe 3 O 4 /PS when its initial concentrations were 50, 100 and 200 mg/ L, respectively [148].

        <p>Based on the sonocatalytic degradation of SMZ with pre-magnetized Fe 0 /PS, Pan, et al. have demonstrated that the degradation rate of SMZ is mainly determined by the amount of Fe 2+ produced from Fe 0 [160].

Thus, the removal of SMZ increased with increasing Fe 0 doses over the above range. Meanwhile, k 1 value increased from 0.028 min -1 , at 0.05 mM Fe 0 , to 0.176 min -1 at 0.40 mM Fe 0 , but slightly decreased at 0.80 mM Fe 0 (0.143 min -1 ) due to the consumption of SR by excess Fe 2+ . Thus, 0.40 mM Fe was noted to be the optimum dosage and the optimum ratio of Fe 0 /PS was denoted as 2/5 [160].Based on the sonocatalytic degradation of SMZ with pre-magnetized Fe 0 /PS, Pan, et al. have demonstrated that the degradation rate of SMZ is mainly determined by the amount of Fe 2+ produced from Fe 0 [160].

As an initiator, Fe 3 O activates PS to generate SR, and then accelerates the decomposition of TC. However, the final RE was similar, as a result of the same concentration of PS, since the SR yield is dependent on PS concentration [148]. In addition, the degradation rate of TC increases with increasing martite nanoparticle dosage, and the sonocatalytic RE of 100 mg/L TC reached 87% with 0.5 g/L martite (Fe 2 O 3 )/3 mM Oxone at pH 4 for 60 min [111].Hou, et al. have concluded that initial degradation rates increase with various doses of Fe 3 O 4 , in the range from 0 to 2.0 g/L, in the sonocatalytic degradation of TC with Fe 3 O 4 /PS [148].

However, when the PS concentration was over 200 mM, the RE decreased as excessive amounts of PS produced sulfate anions rather than active SR.

        <p>. In homogeneous systems, antibiotics such as TC exist in the molecular form under acidic conditions, resulting in higher affinity to the cavitation bubbles where oxidation with higher concentration • OH and the pyrolysis of molecules can occur [33]. Thus, higher RE has been achieved under acidic conditions. For example, 90.5%-91.3% of 50 mg/L TC degradation and 25.7%-28.3% of TOC removal were achieved in 1 L solutions at pH 3 to pH 6 in 60 min under 20 kHz and 100 W sonication with 2 mM Fe 2+ and 2 mM PS. However, the differences in the REs at the various pH values under acidic conditions are not significant. Therefore, it is not necessary to adjust the initial pH to a very low level, and an initial pH of 6 is an optimal pH condition [33]. Similarly, the sonocatalytic degradation of 20 mg/L CAP has been carried out in 50 mL solutions by 22 kHz and P. Liu et al. W sonication for 240 min with 5 mM PS and 0.1 mM Co 2+ [144]. The results revealed that the RE of CAP decreases with increasing pH value, while k 1 values are higher under acidic solutions (pH 1.0-3.3) than those obtained in neutral or basic solutions (pH 5.0-10.0) [144]..

        <p>Photocatalysis that is based on semiconductors provides favourable results, compared to other AOPs, in the destruction of persistent organics. In recent years, conventional photocatalytic processes have exhibited some problems, such as difficulty in the separation and recovery of catalysts, the production of secondary pollution, and the high consumption of catalysts and energy, etc. [30]. Furthermore, the lack of efficient photoactivity under solar-light, the high recombination rate of photo-induced electron-hole (e CB --h VB + ) pairs, and low resistance to photo-corrosion has limited their practicality in environmental applications [83]. To overcome these obstacles, photocatalysis is usually combined with sonication, chemical oxidants or microwave techniques [30]. Sonophotocatalysis has attracted much attention because it is generally considered to be an applicable and environmentally friendly process [113]. The synergistic effect of sonocatalysis and photocatalysis generates a large number of ROS, and thus enhances the oxidation process to remove organic contaminants [83]. The cavitation effects induced by sonication eliminate the defects of photocatalysis, including the decrease in UV-available sites, mass transfer limitations and the blocking of the catalyst surface by contaminants [83].

The working solution, containing 10 mg/L OFX, was prepared by spiking the appropriate mass of the compound in the secondary treated wastewater (collected from the urban wastewater treatment plant (UWTP) of Limassol, Cyprus) and then performing the necessary dilutions. The results revealed that the sonophotocatalytic degradation of OFX follows PFO kinetics. The k 1 values were 0.1054, 0.0713, 0.0203 and 0.0131 min -1 for sono/Photo/TiO 2 , photo/TiO 2 , sono/TiO 2 and sonication alone, respectively. The REs of OFX for 120 min reached 15, 62, 85 and ~ 100% for sonication, sono/TiO 2 , photo/ TiO 2 and sono/photo/TiO 2 , respectively. Therefore, degradation by sonophotocatalysis was generally faster than all the individual processes, presumably due to the enhanced formation of reactive radicals. Additionally, the presence of the TiO 2 catalyst significantly increased the RE of OFX by sonication.

        <p>As listed in Table 8, it was assumed that the negligible REs of TC are caused by very low generation efficiencies of free radicals in photolysis or sonication alone. The increased RE value using the sono/photo process indicates the synergistic effect between sonication and photolysis [30]. 36.8% of RE obtained by MAC@T composite indicated the RE by adsorption onto the catalyst, while an RE of 47.4% by photo/MAC@T is comparable with that (44.9%) obtained by traditional photo/TiO 2 due to the synergistic effect of adsorption and photocatalytic degradation. The highest RE (59.2%) was obtained using the sonophotocatalysis process with MAC@T. This is because the catalyst played roles for adsorption, photocatalysis and sonocatalysis simultaneously. Furthermore, the synergistic effect is associated with a contribution by sonication and the subsequent production of ROS in the system, while the surface of the catalyst was cleaned by sonication continuously to maintain the activity of catalyst [30].As listed in Table 8, it was assumed that the negligible REs of TC are caused by very low generation efficiencies of free radicals in photolysis or sonication alone.

        <p>Zhou, et al. have compared the degradation kinetics and REs of SMZ using 5 different sonocatalytic and photocatalytic systems with Fe 3 O [115]. The SMZ degradation in the sono/photo/Fe 3 O 4 /OA system follows PFO kinetics under the conditions used -25 mg/L SMZ, 0.4 g/L Fe 3 O 4 , 0.8 mM oxalic acid (OA), UV (365 nm, 9 W), US (20 kHz, 330 W), initial pH 3, 20 • C, and the k 1 value reached 3.5 × 10 -2 min -1 , which is about 10-times higher than that obtained in the sono/Fe 3 O 4 /OA system (k 1 = 0.36 × 10 -2 min -1 ). However, the degradation of SMZ in the photo/Fe 3 O 4 /OA system does not follow PFO kinetics, because there was an initial degradation lag period. Thus, sonication was used to reduce the initial lag period of SMZ degradation [115].Zhou, et al. have compared the degradation kinetics and REs of SMZ using 5 different sonocatalytic and photocatalytic systems with Fe 3 O [115].

        <p>The high stability of the SMZ molecule meant that lower REs (ca. 10-20%) were observed after 60 min in the sono/Fe 3 O 4 , sono/photo/ Fe 3 O 4 and sono/Fe 3 O 4 /OA systems, but higher SMZ REs were achieved in the photo/Fe 3 O 4 /OA system and sono/photo/Fe 3 O 4 /OA system [115]. It was speculated that the rapid release of dissolved iron species in the initial reaction phases, induced by Fenton-like reactions, resulted in the efficient production of ROS. Moreover, in the sono/photo/OA and sono/Fe 3 O 4 /OA systems, oxalate mostly acts as a competitive reactant. By contrast, in the photo/Fe 3 O 4 /OA and sono/photo/Fe 3 O 4 /OA systems OA acts as both a reactant and an ROS initiator [115]. The synergistic degradation of SMZ has also been demonstrated in a sono/photo/ Gothite-Fe 3+ /OA system by integrating in-situ H 2 O 2 generation under UV illumination and efficient Fe 2+ species regeneration (Initial parameters: 25 mg/L SMZ, 0.5 g/L goethite, 0.8 mM OA, 330 W US and pH 3, initial Fe 3+ concentration of 250 µM) [114]. The cleavage of the S-N bond in the SMZ molecule was dominant under • OH attack.

        <p>Transition metal oxide (ZnO) or sulfide (ZnS and SnO 2 ) have been used to accelerate the degradation of antibiotics in sono/photo/Fentonlike processes [82,118]. After pretreatment, the degradation of antibiotics becomes possible using biological treatment processes. The degradation of 10 mg/L RXM and CLA was studied in a sono/photo/ Fenton-like system with ZnS quantum dots decorated onto SnO 2 nanosheets prepared using the hydrothermal method [118]. Without catalysts, REs were low using the Photo method alone, sonication alone, photo/H 2 O 2 , sono/H 2 O 2 and sono/photo/H 2 O 2 , due to the insufficient formation of • OH. With 0.3 g/L catalyst and 6 mM H 2 O 2 , only 31.4% of 10 mg/L CLA and 36.4% of 10 mg/L RXM were removed from 100 mL aqueous solutions at pH 3 after 60 min. When sonication (20 kHz, 75 W) was used to enhance the degradation in the above system, the REs of CLA and RXM increased to 61.2% and 65.5%, while higher REs (68.2% and 72.6%) were obtained in the same system, but in the presence of UV (254 nm, 4 W). Surprisingly, the REs of CLA and RXM reached 86.7% and 90.3% in the sono/photo/Fenton process [118]. Consequently, the superior performance and synergistic effects of the sono/photo/catalyst process were attributed to the promotion of • OH generation [118].Transition metal oxide (ZnO) or sulfide (ZnS and SnO 2 ) have been used to accelerate the degradation of antibiotics in sono/photo/Fentonlike processes [82,118].

        <p>Khataee, et al. have investigated the degradation of MOX by the sonophotocatalytic method using a NiFe-layered double hydroxide/ reduced graphene oxide (NiFe-LDH/rGO) nanocomposite [117]. The RE of MOX (90.4%) by sonophotocatalysis under the used conditions -100 mL of 20 mg/L MOX, pH 8.0, 1.0 g/L catalysts, 36 kHz, 150 W US power, 10 W UV power, 60 min treatment -was higher than the REs of sonocatalysis (72.4%) and photocatalysis (62.7%), but lower than their sum. The results revealed that Ni -Ti LDH) synthesized using the hydrothermal method with NH 4 F [38]. The conditions -100 mL AMX, pH 8.0, 1.0 g/L catalysts, 20 kHz, 200 W US power, 420-470 nm, 400 W UV power and 150 min treatmentallowed the following RE order to be determined: sonocatalysis &lt; photocatalysis &lt; sonophotocatalysis. The formation of • OH on the surface of the g-C 3 N 4 -20 @ Ni -Ti LDH particles was approved using the terephthalic acid probe in photoluminescence spectroscopy [38]. Thus, the observed enhancement in the sonophotocatalytic activity of the nanocomposites can be related to their higher specific surface areas, the intimacy of the contact interfaces of their individual components, i.e., pristine g-C 3 N 4 and Ni -Ti LDH, the synergistic effect between these components and restriction of electronhole recombination. Ghoreishian, et al. have investigated the degradation of TC by sonophotocatalysis with flower-like rGO/CdWO 4 hierarchical structures that were synthesized using a facile wet-chemistry method without any calcination [83]. rGO/CdWO 4 exhibited significant photoelectrochemical performance under the conditions used -500 mL of 13.54 mg/L AMX, 0.432 g catalysts, 60 min treatment -and demonstrated superior sonophotocatalytic activity and mineralization efficiency compared with CdWO 4 [83]. Thus, the higher catalytic activity of rGO/CdWO 4 is attributable to rGO, which catches TC residuals from aqueous solution and acts as a charge acceptor to promote the separation of photo-generated carriers via its π-π conjugated structure.Khataee, et al. have investigated the degradation of MOX by the sonophotocatalytic method using a NiFe-layered double hydroxide/ reduced graphene oxide (NiFe-LDH/rGO) nanocomposite [117].

        <p>Due to the emerging nature of sonophotocatalysis, little has been reported on the effects of critical factors. The performance of sonophotocatalytic systems is influenced by various parameters, such as US and UV conditions, catalyst dosage, pH value, initial antibiotic concentration, additives, etc. [30,[82][83][84]. In general, the RE of antibiotics increases with increasing US intensity, UV intensity [38] and catalyst dosage [26,30,84,117,118,145], and acidic conditions favour degradation [20,115]. For example, Tavasol, et al. have designed a photocatalyst of sea sediment/titanate to remove CPX from aqueous media in the presence of sono/photo/H 2 O 2 [26]. Under the conditions -150 mL of 100 mg/L CPX, pH 6.8, 40 kHz US, 15 W UV power, 100 min treatmentthe removal of antibiotics was achieved with increasing titanium content loaded onto the sediments (1.5 g/L catalysts), due to higher surface area and higher photocatalytic activity that it provides [26].Due to the emerging nature of sonophotocatalysis, little has been reported on the effects of critical factors.

        <p>In some cases, the ratio of catalyst and acid (e.g., Fe 3 O 4 /OA) is also an important factor for the degradation of antibiotics [115]. As discussed above, sonocatalysis or photocatalysis alone are not adequate to effectively remove antibiotics from aqueous solutions, but the addition of either H 2 O 2 or PS significantly enhances the RE, while RE increases with increasing concentration of additives [26,162]. For example, OFX degradation increases slightly upon increasing the H 2 O 2 concentration, but with an optimum level of H 2 O 2 concentration at 0.14 mM. [84]. Zeng, et al. have investigated the degradation of LEV by visible-lightdriven sonophotocatalysis and PS activation over 3D urchin-like MoS 2 /C nanoparticles [165]. The radical species • OH and SO ⋅ -4 were accelerated, while ⋅O -2 was limited in this coupled system, which largely facilitates its excellent degradation performance with a synergistic effect [145].In some cases, the ratio of catalyst and acid (e.g., Fe 3 O 4 /OA) is also an important factor for the degradation of antibiotics [115].

        <p>The significant synergistic degradation of SMZ can be further evidenced by the results of mineralization and detoxification of treated water samples. 78% of TOC was removed in a sono/photo/Fe 3 O 4 /OA system after 1 h of reaction time, with an increase of the corresponding EC 50 from 17% (the raw sample) to 89%. The efficiencies of mineralization and detoxification were much higher than those achieved in the other six systems [115]. Montoya-Rodríguez et al. have observed 100% removal of AMP after 75 min of treatment with the sonochemical process. Moreover, the antimicrobial activity of AMP significantly decreased, which was related to attacks of • OH on the active nucleus [45].

        <p>Toxicity depends on the chemical properties and concentration of not only the OFX that was initially present, but also of its transformation products (TPs). Interestingly, the by-products formed during the dissolved organic matter (DOM) oxidation seem to play a similar role with regards to the toxicity changes as that of the by-products formed during OFX degradation [84]. Antimicrobial activity (AA) has been assessed by the Kirby-Bauer method using Staphylococcus aureus as the indicator microorganism.

        <p>The stability and reusability of catalysts used in sonophotocatalysis are critical to the promotion of the degradation of antibiotics. Evaluations have revealed that some catalysts are robust. For example, insignificant loss was observed in the sonophotocatalytic activity of the nanocomposites of g-C 3 N 4 -20@Ni -Ti LDH even after five consecutive runs [38]. Both Fe leaching and loss of decontamination were slight after reuse, indicating that MAC@T has high stability and reusability [30]. The rapid degradation of SMZ and the decomposition of oxalate could still be achieved in the heterogeneous sonophotolytic Fenton-like system using goethite over five consecutive reaction cycles [114].

        <p>Ozone is a powerful oxidant that can directly react with contaminants or decompose into more powerful oxidants -free radicals. Ozonation has usually been used to remove refractory organics, including antibiotics, and improve biodegradability. However, high costs, poor gas-liquid mass transfer and selective oxidation have limited its use. Due to the cavitation effects, such as hotspots, microjets, shockwaves, turbulence, etc., sonication enables the mass transfer and • OH production to be improved, leading to significantly high degradation rates for antibiotics [77][78][79]119,120]. It was speculated that cavitation effects reduce the liquid-film thickness of gas bubbles containing O 3 , and increase the gas/liquid specific surface area. Meanwhile, the diffusion of free radicals, generated in the vapour phase of cavitation bubbles and O 3 /O 2 bubbles, into the bulk solution is enhanced under sonication to oxidize hydrophilic antibiotics [78].Ozone is a powerful oxidant that can directly react with contaminants or decompose into more powerful oxidants -free radicals.

        <p>For example, AMX cannot be efficiently oxidized through sonication alone, but can be removed efficiently using ozonation or sonozonation [77]. Moreover, the oxidative degradation efficiency of AMX using the above methods has been identified by intermediate analysis with GC-MS, mineralization analysis and the Microtox toxicity test [77]. In ozonation processes, six products, formed via the hydroxylation of AMX, demethylation, decarboxylation and the opening of beta-lactam and thiazole rings with ROS, have been observed under alkaline conditions. The degradation pathway of AMX by sonozonation is similar to that of ozonation. Scheme 6 shows the pathway of intermediate formation during the degradation of AMX by the sonication, ozonation and sonozonation processes.

The enhancement of SMX degradation by sonozonation can reduce the consumption of chemicals, which is particularly interesting for performing the scale-up of sonozonation process [119].Naddeo et al. have investigated the degradation of SMX using sonozonation with 20 kHz and 370 W/L US [119]. 61% of SMX was removed from 200 mL of a 10 mg/L SMX solution, with 3.3 g/h of O 3 dose, after 40 min in the sonozonation system, while 51% SMX was removed by ozonation alone [119].

        <p>Guo et al. have also investigated the degradation of SMX by sonozonation with 20 kHz and 600 W/L US [120]. A 100 mg/L (0.5 mM) SMX solution was treated in a 1.5 L-reactor with 3.0 g/h of O 3 dose, and about 95% of SMX was removed after 5 min treatment in the sonozonation system, while only 3% and about 85% SMX was removed by sonication alone and ozonation alone [120].Guo et al. have also investigated the degradation of SMX by sonozonation with 20 kHz and 600 W/L US [120].

        <p>The RE of antibiotics by sonozonation is influenced by various parameters, including O 3 concentration/flow rate [78,79,119], pH value [77][78][79]119,120], initial antibiotic concentration [78,79], US power/ frequency [78,79], and additives [77][78][79], as discussed below.The RE of antibiotics by sonozonation is influenced by various parameters, including O 3 concentration/flow rate [78,79,119], pH value [77][78][79]119,120], initial antibiotic concentration [78,79], US power/ frequency [78,79], and additives [77][78][79], as discussed below.</p>
        <p>In general, O 3 concentration in a gas increases with the yield or dosage of O 3 production under an identical gas flowrate. Naddeo et al. have noted that the degradation of SMX was enhanced by increasing ozone flows in the sonozonation system, which was attributed to improved O 3 mass transfer [119]. Guo et al. have found that the RE of SMX doubled as O 3 dosage increased from 2 to 5 g/h, because the increasing ozone concentration was able to improve the mass transfer of O 3 from the gas to liquid phase [78]. In addition, the increasing O concentration increase the amount of O 3 molecules and • OH that were available to react with antibiotics in solution [78].In general, O 3 concentration in a gas increases with the yield or dosage of O 3 production under an identical gas flowrate.

        <p>Wang et al. have also demonstrated that the RE of TC increases with increasing gaseous O 3 concentration and gas flowrate in a sonozonation system [79]. On the one hand, k 1 values were 0.42, 0.66, 0.85 and 1.34 min -1 at 30, 35, 40 and 50 L/h of gas flowrate, respectively. The increasing gas flowrate increases the net surface area and improved O mass transfer from the gas phase to aqueous phase, thus increasing the volumetric mass transfer coefficient of O 3 [79]. On the other hand, k values reached 0.66, 0.77, 0.84 and 1.04 min -1 at 35.8, 44.5, 45.6 and 47 mg/L of gaseous O 3 concentration, respectively. This suggests that the increasing gaseous O 3 concentration increased the equilibrium O concentration in the aqueous phase, according to Henry's law. The increasing equilibrium O 3 concentration also improved O 3 mass transfer from the gas phase to the liquid phase [79]. Scheme 7. The degradation pathway of TC in the sonozonation system.

        <p>The pathways of ozonation generally include direct oxidation by O 3 molecules, which is more selective and predominant under acidic conditions, and the indirect oxidation by • OH that is formed in situ, which is non-selective and predominant under alkaline conditions [78,79]. Therefore, the predominant reaction and reaction rate during ozonation can be controlled by adjusting pH value, which is also considered a critical factor for the efficiency of sonozonation [78]. The increase of reaction rate means that a shorter reaction time is required to complete the degradation of antibiotics, while O 3 consumption and operation costs are reduced [120].The pathways of ozonation generally include direct oxidation by O 3 molecules, which is more selective and predominant under acidic conditions, and the indirect oxidation by • OH that is formed in situ, which is non-selective and predominant under alkaline conditions [78,79].

        <p>Guo et al. have found that the degradation rate of SMX increases with increasing pH value. SMX has two pKa values, of 1.6 and 5.7, resulting in protonated, non-protonated and deprotonated forms at different pH values. The amino groups are possible reaction centres that are most susceptible to O 3 electrophilic attack. The non-protonated form is the predominant form at pH &lt; 7, and is less susceptible to O 3 attack than the deprotonated form, leading to lower k 1 values under acidic conditions (0.29 min -1 at pH 3; 0.30 min -1 at pH 5). At pH 7, SMX molecules were converted into the completely deprotonated form, which had a higher reactivity towards O 3 molecules. Under basic conditions, the oxidation of SMX was enhanced due to the generation of numerous • OH species (0.42 min -1 at pH 7; 0.50 min -1 at pH 9). Consequently, the degradation rate of SMX under basic conditions was higher than under acidic conditions [78].Guo et al. have found that the degradation rate of SMX increases with increasing pH value.

        <p>Furthermore, the enhancement of sonication on SMX degradation by ozonation varied by 6-26% under different pH values, and the highest enhanced effect was observed at pH 5 [120]. This suggests that sonication promoted the diffusion of O 3 molecules in water under acidic conditions and increased the contact area between O 3 and SMX, resulting in increased RE of SMX by direct-oxidation with O 3 molecules. Under neutral and alkali conditions, sonication increased the degradation rates of SMX by only 6-7%. This indicates that sonication slightly enhanced O 3 decomposition and the yield of • OH, which is responsible for the indirect-oxidation [120].Furthermore, the enhancement of sonication on SMX degradation by ozonation varied by 6-26% under different pH values, and the highest enhanced effect was observed at pH 5 [120].

        <p>TC degradation rate has also increased as the pH value increased from 3 to 9 in a sonozonation process [79]. Similarly, there are four different species of TC molecule, TCH 3 + , TCH 2 , TCH -and TC 2-, in which the protonation-deprotonation reactions depend on pH value. The deprotonated TC with a positively charged group at higher pH values is more easily attacked by O 3 molecules and/or • OH than TC itself. Thus, the TC degradation rate increases with increasing pH [79]. Likewise, AMX is a hydrophilic and weak polyprotic acid with three pKa values of 2.67, 7.11 and 9.55 at 37 • C. At pH 10, dissolution is favoured for the more degradable forms of AMX when the amine is deprotonated and a pair of electrons is available for electrophilic attack, while the increased solubility of AMX at pH 10 leads to higher reaction rates in the presence of the readily abundant radicals formed in the 575 kHz US field [77].TC degradation rate has also increased as the pH value increased from 3 to 9 in a sonozonation process [79].

        <p>Since the concentrations of O 3 and • OH available are almost identical under the same operation conditions in a sonozonation system, and are independent of the initial antibiotic concentrations, the degradation rate decreases mostly with increasing antibiotic concentration. For example, the k 1 value of SMX degradation decreased three-fold (from 0.37 to 0.09 min -1 ) as SMX concentration increased from 50 to 400 mg/L in a sonozonation system. The additional reason for this is the fact that the competing reactions between SMX and its degradation products gradually turned predominant with the increasing initial SMX concentration. Such competing reactions reduced the reaction rates of SMX with O 3 and • OH [78]. Similarly, the TC degradation rate also decreased with increasing initial TC concentration in a sonozonation system, and the k 1 value decreased from 0.92 to 0.59 min -1 when TC concentration increased from 200 to 800 mg/L [79].Since the concentrations of O 3 and • OH available are almost identical under the same operation conditions in a sonozonation system, and are independent of the initial antibiotic concentrations, the degradation rate decreases mostly with increasing antibiotic concentration.

        <p>Increasing US power density can generally enhance the turbulence effect, resulting in increased antibiotic degradation rates, as the enhanced turbulence favours O 3 mass transfer from the gas to liquid phase [78]. It has been speculated that powerful sonication enhances mechanical mixing, making O 3 -containing bubbles smaller and reducing the thickness of liquid films [79]. In addition, more O 3 molecules can be decomposed to generate more ROS under more powerful sonication. For example, the k 1 values of SMX degradation reached 0.25, 0.26 and 0.30 min -1 at 400, 600 and 800 W/L of power density in a sonozonation system, respectively [78]. Moreover, the TC degradation rate increased with increasing power density, and the k 1 values of TC degradation reached 0.57, 0.71, 0.90, 1.04, 1.74 and 2.60 min -1 at 0, 85.3, 125.4, 142.8, 169.8 and 218.6 W/L of power density, respectively [79].Increasing US power density can generally enhance the turbulence effect, resulting in increased antibiotic degradation rates, as the enhanced turbulence favours O 3 mass transfer from the gas to liquid phase [78].

        <p>The chemical structures and hydrophobicity of antibiotics generally influence their degradation kinetics and efficiency [119]. Little competitive oxidation of SMX, diclofenac and carbamazepine has been observed in a mixing solution under sonozonation, showing that the simultaneous presence of SMX, diclofenac and carbamazepine is not an obstacle for degradation via sonozonation [119].The chemical structures and hydrophobicity of antibiotics generally influence their degradation kinetics and efficiency [119].

        <p>This indicates that the oxidation of TC by • OH that are generated in situ dominates the degradation of TC by sonozonation [79]. By contrast, the addition of the radical scavenger t-butanol can accelerate the SMX degradation rate [78], and it has been speculated that the direct oxidation of SMX by O 3 molecules is the dominant pathway in the sonozonation system. The presence of H 2 O 2 improved the TC degradation rate when the H 2 O 2 concentration did not exceeded 10 mM, while the presence of t-butanol inhibited the TC degradation rate to some extent [79].This indicates that the oxidation of TC by • OH that are generated in situ dominates the degradation of TC by sonozonation [79].

        <p>Alkalinity and humic acid species reduced the RE (50% decrease) by sonication alone as radical reactions control the degradation of AMX [77]. However, the addition of alkalinity, humic acid and both did not significantly change the removal rate of AMX during both ozonation and sonozonation, since, in this case, the reaction of AMX with O 3 molecules controls the degradation [77].Alkalinity and humic acid species reduced the RE (50% decrease) by sonication alone as radical reactions control the degradation of AMX [77].

        <p>Besides enhancing the degradation of antibiotics by ozonation, sonication can simultaneously promote the mineralization and detoxification of antibiotics in aqueous solutions. The Microtox toxicity test has been used to find the concentration value of the treated effluents that affects 50% of the microorganisms in a solution (EC50), and thus to assess the toxicity of solutions. The initial AMX solution shows high toxicity with a EC50 value of 14% [77]. Under sonozonation (250 mL of 25 mg/L AMX, 575 kHz, 75 W/L US power, 0.13 mg/L O 3 , pH 10.0, min treatment), the EC50 value decreased to 10.87% and 13.59% after treatment with sonication and ozonation alone, respectively, showing that the intermediates with higher toxicity were formed during the degradation of AMX. By contrast, the EC50 value increased to 67.48% under sonozonation, indicating that fewer intermediates were formed with a higher mineralization degree [77]. For the degradation of mg/L SMX by sonozonation, with 20 kHz, 600 W/L US and 5.0 g/h O 3 at pH 7.0 for 30 min, the BOD 5 /COD ratio increased from 0 to 0.54 after sonozonation treatment and the biological toxicity of the solution was reduced [78].Besides enhancing the degradation of antibiotics by ozonation, sonication can simultaneously promote the mineralization and detoxification of antibiotics in aqueous solutions.

        <p>During the degradation of 400 mg/L TC by sonozonation with 20 kHz and 142.8 W/L of US at pH 7, Wang et al. found that the COD removal reached 91% after 90 min treatment, while very low COD removal was obtained by sonication alone, due to the lower production of free radicals by sonication at 20 kHz. 76% of COD removal was achieved by ozonation alone at a gas flow rate of 35 L/h, which contained 45.6 mg/L O 3 [79]. The initial TC solution resulted in 24% death of the crustaceans after 24 h of exposure. However, the acute toxicity reached its maximum after 10 min of sonozonation treatment, and the mortality was as high as 95%. The acute toxicity then gradually decreased to 80% in 70 min and 60% in 90 min of treatment [79]. Finally, it should be mentioned that most of the reported work, whether it used sonication alone or hybrid processes, made use of standard solutions and simulated wastewater to investigate the removal of antibiotics. Only a few studies have focused on the comparison of simulated and actual wastewater. Higher degradation rates (Rd) have been found for AMP in simulated urine than in distilled water (ρ &gt; 1, ρ = Rd in matrix/Rd in distilled water), which indicates that sonochemical processes are suitable for the removal of antibiotics in complex matrices [45]. OXA was difficult to mineralize (360 min) under sonication, while it can be completely mineralized using non-adapted microorganisms from a municipal wastewater treatment plant, which demonstrates that the sonication process transformed the antibiotic into substances that are bio-treatable using a typical aerobic biological system [127]. Furthermore, the highest (the most hydrophobic, i.e., CLX) and lowest (the most hydrophilic, i.e., CPD) Rd of antibiotics were observed in simulated hospital wastewater and seawater. A higher degradation rate for CLX was obtained in simulated hospital wastewater and seawater than in distilled water (ρ &gt; 1), probably due to the salting-out effect exerted by matrix components. The moderate inhibition of CPD removal in hospital wastewater and seawater, compared to distilled water, has been attributed to competition by • OH with the other substances in the matrices [128]. Compared with synthetic water, the RE of CIP for 15 min and mineralization for 60 min in real wastewater from a municipal wastewater treatment plant was decreased by 13.6 and 18.9% respectively, which illustrates that the treatment of CIP and TOC by the sono/ Fe 2+ /H 2 O 2 process is significantly hampered in a real matrix [31].During the degradation of 400 mg/L TC by sonozonation with 20 kHz and 142.8 W/L of US at pH 7, Wang et al. found that the COD removal reached 91% after 90 min treatment, while very low COD removal was obtained by sonication alone, due to the lower production of free radicals by sonication at 20 kHz. 76% of COD removal was achieved by ozonation alone at a gas flow rate of 35 L/h, which contained 45.6 mg/L O 3 [79].

        <p>Another important factor to consider is the fact that almost all research on the the removal of antibiotics by US involves processes that are performed on a bench scale, thus further pilot-scale investigations are recommended. Factors that should be considered when using pilotscale systems include energy consumption by US, mass transfer, pH adjustment and application in real wastewater samples, temperature controls, etc.Another important factor to consider is the fact that almost all research on the the removal of antibiotics by US involves processes that are performed on a bench scale, thus further pilot-scale investigations are recommended.
