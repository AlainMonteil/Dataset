        <p>Progressive reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, considered as a route to decrease the impact of greenhouse gases (GHG) on climate, is one of the major environmental challenges of today's society. The replacement of fossil energy by renewable energy sources is the best option to tackle that challenge. The main downside is that renewable energy such as wind and solar is fluctuating, i.e., in many cases, the power from electric generators does not match the energy demand. Besides, renewable energy power installed worldwide is far from enough to meet the global energy demand. Thus, the development and incorporation of alternative transition technologies into the current energy system is necessary [1].Progressive reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, considered as a route to decrease the impact of greenhouse gases (GHG) on climate, is one of the major environmental challenges of today's society.

        <p>In order to control CO2 emissions and stabilize CO2 atmospheric concentration, transition changes are needed in the current energy system. Nowadays, there are two main strategies: (i) CO2 capture and storage (CCS) and (ii) CO2 recycling. Although CCS technology is viable in reducing CO2 emissions, it has some disadvantages such as the necessity of a site for CO2 sequestration close to CO2 source or the costly transportation of captured CO2 to the storage site, which reduces the efficiency of the process [2]. Nevertheless, CO2 recycling is considered a complementary and interesting alternative to CCS. Through this process, CO2, the major atmospheric pollutant, can be converted into chemical compounds (mainly urea, salicyclic acid and polycarbonates) or fuels [2][3][4]. Considering that the amount of carbon emitted from fossil fuels combustion is 100 times higher than that used for synthesis of chemicals, it seems more reasonable to convert CO2 into different energy vectors such as methane, methanol and dimethylether [4][5][6][7].In order to control CO2 emissions and stabilize CO2 atmospheric concentration, transition changes are needed in the current energy system.

        <p>Among the different conversion alternatives, CO2 methanation is thermodynamically the most favorable reaction. Carbon dioxide, captured from combustion or other processes, can be combined with H2 generated from renewable energy and catalytically converted into methane or synthetic natural gas (SNG) according to the Sabatier reaction:Among the different conversion alternatives, CO2 methanation is thermodynamically the most favorable reaction.

        <p>Generally, catalysts used in CO2 methanation consists of group VIII transition metals (active phase) supported over mesoporous solids. γ-Alumina has proven to be an effective support to carry out CO2 methanation [8,9]. This support provides high specific surface area (100-250 m 2 g -1 ), contains surface basicity (hydroxyl groups) for CO2 activation and over which the active phase can be dispersed. Among group VIII metals, Ni and Ru have been the most used [10].Generally, catalysts used in CO2 methanation consists of group VIII transition metals (active phase) supported over mesoporous solids. γ-Alumina has proven to be an effective support to carry out CO2 methanation [8,9].

        <p>These metals, in their reduced state, are able to effectively dissociate the hydrogen that reacts with CO2 adsorbed on the support. Ni-based catalysts have been extensively investigated because of their high activity and low price [11][12][13][14][15], whereas Ru-based catalysts due to their excellent activity and selectivity at low temperature [16][17][18][19][20]. Therefore, a catalytic component is required to activate CO2 for a further reduction, as the aluminum oxide (Al2O3), and also a metal component (here Ni or Ru) that is able to dissociate H2. Providing that both functionalities are present, activity, selectivity and deactivation of the catalyst seem to be significantly dependent on the metal particle size [14,16]. It seems that Ni-based catalysts require high metal loadings and are easily deactivated by sintering or coke deposition, in a more extension than Ru based catalysts, which in turn are much more expensive. In some cases, a third promoter component is used to improve metal dispersion and CO2 adsorption [18,19,21,22] or to avoid fast deactivation by sintering and fouling [12,23].These metals, in their reduced state, are able to effectively dissociate the hydrogen that reacts with CO2 adsorbed on the support.

        <p>In recent literature, there are many works that report separately the catalytic performance of Ni-based and Ru-based formulations at different operation conditions, which makes a direct comparison between the activity of both metals difficult.

        <p>In order to synthesize alumina-supported catalysts with different Ni and Ru contents, a simple, fast and well-known preparation method such as wetness incipient impregnation was used. This Micromeritics AutoChem 2920 instrument. In the case of Ni/Al2O3, these were firstly pre-treated at 350 °C for 30 min under Ar flow in order to remove adsorbed H2O and CO2. The reducing gas flow was 50 cm 3 STP/min of 5%H2/Ar and the temperature was increased from 30 to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min -1 . The water formed during reduction was trapped using a cold trap and the hydrogen consumption was continuously monitored with a TCD detector.In order to synthesize alumina-supported catalysts with different Ni and Ru contents, a simple, fast and well-known preparation method such as wetness incipient impregnation was used.

        <p>Additionally, the effect of Ni and Ru incorporation on the surface basicity was studied by means of CO2-TPD. Figure 1 shows the CO2-TPD profiles for γ-Al2O3 and for the catalysts with the highest contents of Ru and Ni, i.e., 5%Ru/Al2O3 and 20%Ni/Al2O3. As it can be observed, the prepared samples contain different CO2 adsorption sites with different strength. According to desorption temperature or chemical bond strength, basic sites can be classified into weak (T &lt; 150 °C), medium (T = 150-350 °C) and strong (T &gt; 350 °C) [14,25]. On the one hand, it can be observed that bare alumina presents a single desorption peak at 105 °C, attributed to CO2 desorption from weak Bronsted OH -groups [26]. On the other hand, the new CO2 desorption peaks observed for 20%Ni/Al2O3 and 5%Ru/Al2O3 catalysts indicate that Ni and Ru addition leads to the formation of new basic sites with different strength. 20%Ni/Al2O3 presents a new CO2 desorption peak at 275 °C, associated with decomposition of bidentate carbonate from medium-strength basic sites [15], whereas 5%Ru/Al2O3 catalyst shows a CO2 desorption peak at 425 °C, attributed to decomposition of monodentate carbonate from strong basic sites [27]. The CO2 surface density quantification obtained from integration of MS 44 signal is also shown in Table 1. While the CO2 surface density of bare alumina is 0.32 μmol m -2 , the addition of increasing contents of Ni and Ru rises this value up to 0.5 and 0.42 μmol m -2 , respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that Ni and Ru impregnation not only results in the formation of new type of basic sites, but also in an increase of surface basicity.Additionally, the effect of Ni and Ru incorporation on the surface basicity was studied by means of CO2-TPD.

        <p>This increase of surface basicity with addition of both Ni and Ru could also theoretically be explained in terms of electronegativity. The electronegativity values of the elements that participate in CO2 adsorption are 1.6, 1.9, 2.3 and 3.5 for Al, Ni, Ru and O, respectively. These values indicate that surface O 2-and OH -groups linked to Al must contain higher negative charge density (lower basicity) than those attached to Ni and Ru. Thus, differences in electronegativity show that the involved 3 metals transfer negative charge density to surface O 2-following the sequence: Al &gt; Ni &gt; Ru. Therefore, considering that CO2 is an acid gas with a high negative charge density, the sites with the highest CO2 adsorption capacity (and the lowest negative charge density) correspond to O 2-(and OH -if applicable) linked to Ru, followed by those linked to Ni and finally those bound to Al.This increase of surface basicity with addition of both Ni and Ru could also theoretically be explained in terms of electronegativity.

        <p>In all cases, XRD peaks can be observed at 37.7, 45.8 and 66.8° 2θ, corresponding to gammaalumina (311), ( 400) and (440) diffraction planes, respectively (PDF 01-079-1558). These broad peaks together with an elevated XRD signal background point out that this γ-Al2O3 is rather an amorphous than a crystalline solid, which makes the identification of crystalline nano-particles more difficult due to peaks overlapping. In fact, for Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, the presence of crystalline Ni phases was only detected for catalysts with Ni contents higher than 8%.

        <p>Both crystallite sizes and Ni dispersion are summarized in 2. Note that Ru crystallite size increases from 7.4 to 12.1 nm, suggesting a small decrease in active phase dispersion. This trend is in line with H2 chemisorption results: Ru dispersion slightly decreases from 5.5 to 3.9% as metallic content increases from 1 to 5%. Then, the lowest dispersion of 5%Ru/Al2O3 catalyst may be associated with the presence of larger Ru particles formed by agglomeration of several Ru nano-crystals.Both crystallite sizes and Ni dispersion are summarized in 2.

        <p>In order to determine the effect of temperature on the crystallinity of Ni/Al2O3 and Ru/Al2O3 samples, additional thermodiffractometric studies were done. Figure 3a shows a waterfall of XRD patterns of 12%Ni/Al2O3 catalyst measured between 30 and 1010 °C. The variations in intensity and position of the diffraction peaks with temperature are related to changes in the sample crystallinity or to the formation/disappearance of crystalline nickel phases. In fact, the unique peaks that remain unchanged in the whole temperature range are those assigned to inevitable diffraction of the platinum sample holder, at 39.7, 46.2 and 67.4° 2θ. Note that the color of the sample changed with temperature following this sequence: from gray to greenishgray, from greenish-gray to greenish-blue and from greenish-blue to blue. In the 30 -310 °C temperature range, only the characteristic XRD peaks of Al2O3 were detected, suggesting that higher temperature is needed for the formation of Ni crystalline phases. However, from 310 to 610 °C the development of a broad band can be observed at 62.9° 2θ, which is tentatively attributed to highly dispersed greenish-gray NiO. Finally, above 610 °C NiO characteristic peaks disappearance is detected, followed by the formation of more intense peak at 59.7° 2θ, assigned to blue NiAl2O4 [27,28], being more crystalline than highly dispersed NiO. Note that above 710 °C, the peak at 37° 2θ gains in intensity, as a result of NiAl2O4 spinel formation contribution.In order to determine the effect of temperature on the crystallinity of Ni/Al2O3 and Ru/Al2O3 samples, additional thermodiffractometric studies were done.

        <p>Therefore, it seems that the formation of spinel takes place at temperatures above 600 °C and considering that Ni/Al2O3 samples were calcined at 500 °C, the presence of considerable amount of NiAl2O4 in the prepared catalysts seems unlikely.Therefore, it seems that the formation of spinel takes place at temperatures above 600 °C and considering that Ni/Al2O3 samples were calcined at 500 °C, the presence of considerable amount of NiAl2O4 in the prepared catalysts seems unlikely.</p>

        <p>In order to study the atomic surface composition of prepared catalysts and the nature of surface Ni and Ru species, XPS characterization was carried out. A certain amount of carbon, attributed to atmospheric CO2 adsorption, was detected by XPS on the surface of all catalysts (between 12 and 15%). Therefore, a direct analysis of the quantitative results of the surface composition is complex and more relevant information is obtained by analyzing the ratio of concentrations between elements.

Figures 4a and4b</p>
        <p>In Figure 4a, it can be observed that in both cases the amount of surface Ni increases with the total amount of Ni. However, the surface Ni/Al ratios are below the auxiliary line, which suggests a certain decrease in Ni dispersion (see Figure 4a). These results are consistent with XRD results, where an increase of Ni particle size with the metal loading was observed. Note that the Ni/Al ratios are lower in the used catalysts compared to the fresh ones, indicating sintering during the catalytic tests. The impregnation of different amounts of Ru, however, has a different effect on Ru/Al surface atomic ratio (see Figure 4b). In this case, the amount of surface Ru also increases with Ru content; but unlike the Ni/Al ratios, the Ru/Al ratios follow the auxiliary line. This indicates that Ru dispersion does not vary considerably with the increase of metal loading from 1 to 5%. In fact, similar particle sizes of Ru were observed by H2-chemisorption indicating the same trend. Finally, observe that the Ru/Al ratios are similar in fresh and in used catalysts, i.e., Ru dispersion remains stable during reaction, except for the 5% Ru sample. All these catalysts exhibit peaks close to 856.0 and 858.0 eV with its corresponding shake-up satellites at ~862.0 and ~864.5 eV. Note that the first peak is located among 853.9 and 857.0 eV, binding energies assigned to bulk NiO and NiAl2O4, respectively [31]. From this observation, we can discard the presence of great amount of bulk NiO on all catalysts. The main peak at 856 eV corresponds to Ni 2+ interacting with alumina [32], while the smaller peak at 858 eV is consistent with the formation of nickel spinel NiAl2O4 [28]. On the one hand, the slight shift of the main peak towards higher BE with the increase of Ni content could be due to the weakening of metal-support interaction [33]. On the other hand, the main peak remains in the same position after reaction, indicating that Ni species are stable during catalytic tests. It should also be mentioned that no Ni 0 specie was found in used catalysts (Figure 5b), since its passivation occurs when the samples are in contact with air.In Figure 4a, it can be observed that in both cases the amount of surface Ni increases with the total amount of Ni. However, the surface Ni/Al ratios are below the auxiliary line, which suggests a certain decrease in Ni dispersion (see Figure 4a). These results are consistent with XRD results, where an increase of Ni particle size with the metal loading was observed. Note that the Ni/Al ratios are lower in the used catalysts compared to the fresh ones, indicating sintering during the catalytic tests. The impregnation of different amounts of Ru, however, has a different effect on Ru/Al surface atomic ratio (see Figure 4b). In this case, the amount of surface Ru also increases with Ru content; but unlike the Ni/Al ratios, the Ru/Al ratios follow the auxiliary line. This indicates that Ru dispersion does not vary considerably with the increase of metal loading from 1 to 5%. In fact, similar particle sizes of Ru were observed by H2-chemisorption indicating the same trend. Finally, observe that the Ru/Al ratios are similar in fresh and in used catalysts, i.e., Ru dispersion remains stable during reaction, except for the 5% Ru sample.

        <p>H2-TPR experiments were carried out in order to analyze the reduction state of Ni and Ru species dispersed on alumina but also to determine the effect of metal loading over the reducibility of the prepared catalysts. Figures 7a and7b show H2-TPR profiles of fresh Ni/Al2O3 and Ru/Al2O3 catalysts, respectively. First of all, differences in redox properties are evident: the complete reduction of nickel-based catalyst is only achieved by increasing the temperature up to 900 °C, whereas only 250 °C are required for ruthenium loaded catalysts. These distinct redox properties could be translated in different catalytic performances, since it is well known that both active sites (Ni or Ru) must be reduced to carry out the hydrogenation of CO2 efficiently. H2-TPR profiles displayed in Figure 7a present 3 deconvoluted H2 consumption peaks assignable to three different Ni species, named α, β and γ [14,33,38]. The peak located at the lowest temperature, close to 550 °C, is attributed to reduction of α-type NiO, weakly interacting with alumina. The second peak centered at 670 °C, however, is assigned to reduction of β-type NiO with stronger interaction with the support [28,39]. Finally, the peak at the highest temperature, with maximum located close to 780 °C, is assigned to reduction of γ-type Ni specie forming well dispersed NiAl2O4 structure, in line with the results observed by thermo XRD study and XPS.

        <p>The performance of catalysts was evaluated by analyzing CO2 conversions and CH4 yields. In all cases, CO was the only secondary product and carbon balance closed within ± 5%. The catalytic activity at different temperatures as a function of the Ni and Ru loading is shown in Figures 8a and8b, respectively. First of all, as it can be clearly observed, the increase of metal content results in an enhancement of catalytic activity and, generally, a higher temperature provides a higher CO2 conversion. However, slight decrease of CO2 conversion is observed at temperatures above 400 °C in cases where conversions close to that of equilibrium are obtained, as expected for exothermic reactions. Regarding Ni/Al2O3 catalysts (Figure 8a), the onset temperature for CO2 methanation is around 250 °C, the highest CO2 conversions are achieved close to 450 °C for catalysts with Ni contents higher than 8% ( X ≈ 80%) when reaction temperatures rises over 400 °C. Therefore, it can be concluded that 12% Ni loading and a metallic surface of 5.1 m 2 g -1 is sufficient to provide enough active sites (Ni 0 ) in order to achieve high CO2 conversions at intermediate-high temperatures.The performance of catalysts was evaluated by analyzing CO2 conversions and CH4 yields.

Taking into account that the variation of Ru loading is much lower, similar T50 reduction, as compared to Ni catalysts, is obtained: from 396 °C (1% Ru) to 310 °C (5% Ru).

        <p>In the case of Ni based catalysts, the slight particle sintering seems to be compensated by the activation of additional nickel species and reduction of nickel oxide with high interaction with the alumina. On the other hand, as Ru is completely reduced before the catalytic test, the slight sintering of Ru particles results in a decrease of the CO2 conversion during the stability test. It is worth to mention that in both cases the selectivity to methane kept stable, obtaining values higher than 98% (Figures 11c y 11d). XRD results revealed that alumina supported Ru crystals tend to grow and agglomerate into larger particles with increasing of calcination temperature, resulting in lower metal dispersion.In the case of Ni based catalysts, the slight particle sintering seems to be compensated by the activation of additional nickel species and reduction of nickel oxide with high interaction with the alumina.

The TOF values for Ru/Al2O3 catalyst were considerably higher than those observed for Ni/Al2O3 at low temperature (T &lt; 300 °C), since ruthenium is more effective in H2 dissociation/adsorption than nickel, which is another fundamental step of reaction mechanism.Considering the saturation effect of CO2 conversion with metal loading, 12%Ni/Al2O3 (T50 = 340 °C) and 4%Ru/Al2O3 (T50 = 310 °C) were the best formulations, providing maximum CO2 conversions of 80 and 85% around 425 and 375 °C, respectively and being quite stable for 24hon-stream.

        <p>. The XRD patterns of catalysts with Ni content lower than 12% showed similar diffraction pattern to original Al2O3 (not shown), probably due to a high dispersion of Ni species (crystallite sizes lower than 5 nm). Therefore, Ni crystallite sizes could be only estimated by Scherrer equation for 12, 16 and 20% Ni loaded catalysts. In all cases, Ni crystallite sizes lower than the average pore size of Al2O3 (10.1 nm, see Table.

It can be observed that dispersion values obtained by H2-chemisorption match with the trend observed by XRD: the Ni crystallite size estimated by XRD grows from &lt;5 to 7.3 nm, whereas dispersion is reduced from 38 to 11% with the increase of Ni loading.
