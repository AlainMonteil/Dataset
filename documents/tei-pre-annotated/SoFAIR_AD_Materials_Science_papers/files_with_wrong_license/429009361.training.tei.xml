        <p>The wide range of aluminium variants (alloys and composites) has made it an important material for aviation, automotive components, auto-transmission locomotive section units, S.C.U.B.A. tanks, ship, vessels, submarines fabrication and design etc. regardless of the fact that the aluminium alloys were being utilized in myriads of sectors owing to its exceptional superior and versatile functional characteristics, the property such as wearresistant ought to be enhanced in order to further prolong diverse spectrum of applications. An aluminium alloy having lower hardness and tensile strength has been incorporated with silicon carbide that drastically strengthens the properties. This study involves fabrication of aluminium silicon carbide with muscovite/hydrated aluminium potassium silicate/aluminosilicate in stir casting method to obtain a hybrid metal matrix composite.</p>
        <p>Maintaining a constant amount of aluminium and silicon carbide, muscovite or hydrated aluminium potassium silicate is varied to obtain three distinctive compositions of (Al/SiC/ muscovite) composites. The mechanical characteristics like tensile-strength, flexural-</p>
        <p>Aluminium is the third most abundant material available in nature. It has replaced the ferrous element in wide range of applications due to its specific properties like low density, corrosion-resistance due to passivation, light in weight etc. Aluminium also possesses undesirable characteristics that preclude it from being used in certain sectors. A new material called aluminium-composite was discovered to resolve and combat the flaws/imperfections/inconsistencies in pure aluminium-alloys. Aluminium composites are also called as AleMMC. A metal matrix composite is a combination of two distinct metals to obtain a compounded material known as reinforced material. In metal matrix, matrix is the continuous material in which the reinforcing material is added in whiskers, fabrics and particulates. The reinforcement may be continuous or discontinuous. When more than one reinforcing-constituent is incorporated with the matrix, it is said to be a Hybrid metal matrix composite (HMMC). The aluminium alloy components are replaced with metal matrix aluminium composites (MMC). The MMCs play a vital role in our modern day today life. Graphite or steel with high carbide contents or tungsten carbides or metallic binders also come under this category. It is mainly used when a conventional material does not achieve the required standards or specific demands. Reinforcement of the metal matrix is chosen based on the required property to be achieved with a base metal. Such a MMC's are called as particulate metal matrix composites (PMMCs). The PMMCs lead to obtain a higher-strength and higher-wear resistive material by the reinforcement of hard particles like SiC and B 4 C etc., HMMCs are modern day composites where more than one-type of material of different shapes and sizes are used to improve the properties. They are still advantageous than PMMCs as it involves with advantages more than two materials.</p>
        <p>Metal matrix composites such as cobalt matrix with tungsten carbide particles is used to manufacture carbide drills, steel reinforced with boron nitride is used in tank armours, in power electronic modules aluminium graphite composites are used because of their high thermal conductivity. These composites have wide range of application space systems because of their wide range of operating temperatures and resistance to absorb moisture etc. Macke et al. [1] in their work described about the opportunity in reduction of weight and increase in performance of automobiles using MMCs. Narale et al. [2] carried-out drilling experimental studies to examine the influence of drilling operation-parameters like feedrate, spindle-velocity, drill bit-material and various other parameters of materials as percent-reinforcing constituents on the Al/ B 4 C/muscovite HMMCs. During the drilling process of fabricated specimens, thrust force and drilling torque were determined, along with surface roughness (SR) of specimens after process was analysed and response based on GRA method is discussed. Results reported that the thrust-and drilling twisting forces increases as the percent reinforcingconstituents and feedrate raise. As the percent reinforcingconstituents increases, the SR of the drill-hole reduces. However, as the feedrate rises, the SR also increases. It seemed to be concluded that the superior percent wt. of reinforcing was 10 percent, feedrate was 0.1 mm/revolutions, cutting-velocity was 2000 revolutions/minutes, and Titaniumealuminiumenitride coated carbide-tool was the drill-bit material as it provides highest grey-relational-grade. In another study, authors revealed that the ground muscovite or hydrated aluminium potassium silicate coated with copper found to have good strength and used for bearing applications [3].</p>
        <p>Pargunde et al. [4] successfully casted SiC particulate reinforced aluminium matrix composites by varying weight fraction (ranging from 5 to 20% in steps of 5) and grit size (220, 300 and 400 mesh) of SiC. The hardness (HRB) of samples was evaluated using Brinell hardness tester. The impact strength is calculated with the help of Charpy test. The tests were conducted on sample of size SQ10 mm Ã‚ 55 mm consisting Vnotch of 45 and 2 mm depth. The metallographic analysis was carried out using inverted metallurgical microscope. For this, the cylindrical samples were prepared and etched with 0.5% hydrofluoric acid. Square cross-section recorded and microstructure. The authors were observed better quality of castings obtained through stir casting with minimum air entrapment and minimum setup time. Barekar et al. [5] used high pressure die casting process to formulate the Al (LM24)-Gr aluminium matrix composites. Authors observed regular dispersion of graphite particulates within the aluminium grain structure as a result of shearing technology. Also, a strong bonding is obtained between the constituents which improves the mechanical properties (better tensile strength and elongation) when compared with composite produced through ordinary methods. The improved properties uniform dispersion of reinforcement particulates ensures the benefits of this new casting process.</p>
        <p>Guan et al. [6] evaluated the effect of stirring parameters on the microstructural and tensile strength of novel Al6061eSiCeABO hybrid composites. The investigators described the homogeneity in the dispersion of reinforcements. Also, the improved in tensile strength is obtained with increasing the stirring-time and reducing the temperature. The authors also reported the optimal values of stirring time and temperature as 30 min and 640 c for better microstructure and tensile behaviour. Also, the preheating of reinforcement particulates improves wettability and reduces the possibility of interfacial reactions among the ingredients. In another research, Songmene and Balazinski [7] reported that nickel-coated graphitic AleAl 2 O 3 aluminium matrix composite exhibits better machinability than the AleSiCeGr or AleSiC composites reinforced with graphite and SiC or SiC alone. This improvement attributes to the existence of graphite particulates, which serves as dry-lubricating agents during the machining process. Lokesh et al. [8] evaluated the variation of hardness in stir casted, squeeze casted and stir casted followed by rolling process for Ale4.5Cu alloy composites reinforced with SiC (2e6 by weight with steps of 2) and fly ash (2e4% by weight). Experimental results indicated that squeeze casted composites exhibited more hardness compared to stir casted. This is because of higher pressure applications in this process which reduced porosity, made the composite denser, improved the resistance of plastic deformation and in turn increased the hardness. Furthermore, the rolling process removed the internal voids and refined the materials, results in increased the hardness compared to stir casted or squeeze casted ones.</p>
        <p>Carvalho et al. [9] have investigated that hardness of hybrid composite of the matrix alloy (Al/SiC alloy), Al-CNT and AleSiC composites and AleCNTeSiC hybrid composite. The hardness was increased with addition of CNT and SiC reinforcement material and highest value observed in the hybrid composite when compared with matrix alloy and single reinforcement material. Alidokht et al. [10] also observed that hardness of matrix alloy (A356 alloy) and composite materials with addition of SiC and MoS 2 . With the addition of SiC and MoS 2 material, the hardness was increased and the highest values were reported in the A-356/SiC composite as comparison to the matrix alloy and AleSiCeMoS 2 hybrid composite. Krishnamurthy et al. [11] (2012) developed Al 2 O 3 and calcia stabilized zirconia coating on Aluminium 6061 with the help of spraying method. By comparing the properties of both coatings, density of calcia-stabilized zirconia coatings was found to be denser than alumina coatings, which lead to less erosion of calcia-stabilized zirconia coating under erosion test. By comparing hardness, alumina coating is harder than calcia-stabilized zirconia coating. Strength, young modulus and strain hardening rate shows increment with the increase in reinforcement. They also observed decrease in percentage elongation with reinforcement. Shin et al. [12] evaluated the effects of temper, specimen orientation and temperature on mechanical properties of Al 6061/SiC composites. The author observed that strength and stiffness was improved with the reinforcement but cannot be proved beneficial at 3000 C. Fracture toughness decreases with SiC reinforcement. Aruri et al. [13] fabricated surface hybrid composites of aluminium alloy with reinforcement of SiC, Gr, Al 2 O 3 . They observed increase in micro hardness with the reinforcement of SiC and Al 2 O 3 particles due to their pining effect. Tensile strength decreases with the reinforcement of Al 2 O 3 and SiC particles. S. Gopalakrishnan et al. [14] investigated effects of reinforcement of Titanium carbide (TiC) particles in aluminium alloy 6061. The author found that specific-strength of composites enhances with the raising percentage of TiC particles.</p>
        <p>Mittal et al. [15] explored the mechanical characteristics of aluminium 7075 with reinforcement of SiC, Red mud and Al 2 O 3 . The author revealed that hardness of composites having reinforcement of Al 2 O 3 and red mud is more than the SiC reinforced composites and also increases with the percentage of reinforcement. â‚¬ Ozdemir et al. [16] evaluated the properties of Al/SiC MMCs and revealed that tensile and yield strength improves with the percent-content of SiC up to 17% and decline with further increment in percentage. The elastic modulus increases with % of SiC while ductility of composite decreases. Singh et al. [17] fabricated composite material of aluminium alloy as base matrix and carbon fibre as reinforcement. They found that UTS (Ultimate tensile-strength) and yield-strength increases up to 4 wt.% of carbon fibre. Hardness of composites initially shows an increment with carbon fibre and then decreases with further addition of carbon fibre. Akbari et al. [18] researched the effect of nanosized Al 2 O 3 and copper as a reinforcing-particulates in A-356 alloy. They observed superior compressive strength and hardness of composites than base metal alloy. It increases with the addition of Al 2 O 3 and have maximum hardness and compressive strength with the reinforcement of Al 2 O 3 eCu. Hardness changes over the length of components (cylinder) due to difference in Nano particles and porosity contents, however compressive strength remains constant. Zhang et al. [19] examined the mechanical characteristics of SiCp/Al composites and revealed that the Brinell hardness and modulus of composite increases with the volume-fraction of SiC but no trend was observed for bending strength.</p>
        <p>Kumar et al. [20] explored the effects of reinforcement of Silicon carbide in Al 6061. The authors found that the mechanical properties of composite enhance with the increment in percent-content of SiC. Ductility of material reduces with the reinforcement of SiC. Yue et al. [21] fabricated composite of Al 6061 reinforced with aluminium borate whiskers and investigated its mechanical properties. They observed superior mechanical properties of composites and increases with the reinforcement. Ma et al. [22] observed that Al/SC composites bear excellent mechanical properties and can attain compressive strength up to 304.28 MPa. Kumara et al. [23] studied the effects of reinforcement of SiC and Al 2 O 3 in aluminium matrix and observed that composite with 5% SiC and 2.5% Al 2 O 3 have high microhardness and toughness. Cao et al. [24] examined the mechanical behavioural of carbonefibre reinforced aluminium composites and observed that when compared with the aluminium-matrix, the hardness of composites increases by 46.8%. They also got 18.6% increment in tensile-strength and 13% improvement in elongation of composites fabricated at 100 rpm and at a speed of 75 mm/ min.</p>
        <p>Gireesh et al. [25] investigated the mechanical behavioural of aluminium composite with aloevera powder as a reinforcing constituent, and achieved better tensile strength, impact strength and hardness than base material. However, the main application of metal matrix composites lies in automobile field where it is used as driveshaft's, disc brakes, push rods, cylinder linings and also as a reinforcing in cylinder sleeves. All the above applications have a direct relationship with wear of the component. Thus, improvement in the wear loss found itself very useful. The investigators have gone through different studies in which the addition of silicon carbide and muscovite or hydrated aluminium potassium silicate has been made and has a significant impact in the wear loss. Basavarajappa et al. [26] stated that wear rate of Al-15SiCp-3graphite at weight percent hybrid composite, Al-15SiCp at weight percent composite and matrix alloy (Al 2219 alloy) at various sliding-speed. The wear-rate was found to be constant with a sliding-velocity of 4.61 m/s in the composite and matrix alloy, but further increased sliding speed showed that wear rate was increased in the alloy and Al-15SiCp at weight percent composite in comparison with Al-15SiCp-3 graphite at weight percent hybrid composite. Alidokht et al. [27] also observed low wear rate in the SiC and MoS 2 reinforced hybrid composite than A356 alloy and AleSiC composite at different applied-loads due to the SiC acted as load-carrying material and MoS 2 served as dry-lubricating agent.</p>
        <p>Corrochano et al. [28] investigated dry-sliding behavioural of AA-6061-Molybdenum disilicide under dry-environment and revealed that composite bears higher wear-resistant than monolithic alloys. They also reported the improved wear-resistant of composites as the particulate-size of reinforced material decreased. Benal et al. [29] studied the wear properties of Aluminium 6061 composites with the reinforcement and ageing durations. Researchers observed that heat treated specimens have high hardness and improved wear properties. Wear-rate of hybrid composites also reduces with enhancement in percent-wt. of reinforced material.</p>
        <p>Baradeswaran et al. [30] analysed the wear-behavioural of composites fabricated by introducing B 4 C particles in Al 7075 alloy matrix. The result showed increase in the wear-resistant of composites. Wear rate decreases as compare to metal matrix and found only 11% of pure metal at 10vol% B 4 C reinforcement. Hamid et al. [31] studied the effects of porosity and dispersion of MnO 2 particles on the wear-behavioural of Al(Mn)eAl 2 O 3 (MnO 2 ) composite. They observed decrease in volumetric-loss and improved wear properties of in cast in situ composites as compare to AleMn base alloy and commercial aluminium at high load conditions. Wear-resistant rises with significantly rise in percent volumetric proportion content of in situ porosity composites.</p>
        <p>Jha et al. [32] compared the tribological behaviour of Cenosphere-filled aluminium synthetic foam with aluminium composite reinforced with 10 wt.% SiC particles. Authors observed the wear behaviour at an applied load of 29.43 N &amp; at different sliding velocity. They concluded that aluminium synthetic foam (ASF) has superior wear performance than the aluminium matrix composite (AMC) under similar conditions. Baradeswaran et al. [33] explored the wear-behavioural of aluminium composite fabricated with the Al 2 O 3 and graphite as reinforcing-particulates. Liquid metallurgy route was used to fabricate material. They observed less wear due to thin layer of graphite particles on sliding surface and increase in hardness due to Al 2 O 3 particles. Sharma et al. [34] investigated the wear-characteristics of aluminium fly ash composites. Vortex technique was utilized to process the composites having 2, 4 and 6 wt.% of fly ash content. Author revealed that composites having 6 wt.% of flyash shows less wear (0.32 g), while low friction coefficient (0.12) was achieved at 4 wt.% of fly ash.</p>
        <p>Pramanik [35] explored the effects of Al 2 O 3 reinforcingparticulates in AA-6061. Author observed that the reinforcement of Al 2 O 3 enhances the wear-resistant of composites and useful to control wear. Zhu et al. [36] analysed the wearcharacteristics of AA-356/fly-ash-mullite interpenetrating composites. Wear-resistant of the composites increase with reinforcement and the dry-sliding wear-rate were reported to be quite somewhat less than half the base metal (A356 alloy). Phanibhushana et al. [37] examined the wear-behavioural of Haematite reinforced aluminium composites. Weight loss of specimens was used to calculate the wear-rate of the composites and the result shows improved wear resistance with increase in reinforcement. At reinforcement of 8%, they get 30e40% decrease in wear factor as compare to the base metal.</p>
        <p>Eskandari et al. [38] prepared Strontium titanate and CoFe 2 O 4 based nano composites successfully using sol gel technique. For this, initially CoFe 2 O 4 were prepared using hydrothermal process and SrTiO 3 with sol gel technique. Then after the nano composites viz. CoFe 2 O 4 eSrTiO 3 and SrTiO 3 : NeCoFe 2 O 4 were synthesized were produced with the help of sol gel route. Results indicated that nano-particles agglomerated with the increase of reaction time. However, increasing the temperature has a beneficial impact on the morphology of nano-particles, resulting in the development of homogeneous and spherical nanoparticle. Results also results also indicated that photo-catalytic activity of cobalt ferrite-strontium titanate nanocomposite under UV light was higher than that of pure strontium titanate. Also, the structure of the SrTiO 3 was successfully doped with nitrogen.</p>
        <p>Etminan et al. [39] presented a comparative study on the chemical procedures adopted for the preparation of tin ferrite nano particles. These chemical procedures were included sol gel, co-precipitation, sol gel and hydrothermal routes. Authors also prepared tin ferriteetin oxide nano-composite with the help of co precipitation route, taking 1:1 ratio of the constituents. The XRD pattern was used to analyse the crystal structures of nanoparticles and nanocomposite. SEM was used to determine the particle size. The magnetic characteristics of the products were evaluated using a vibrating sample magnetometer. The purity of the substance was also measured using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIS). Ultraviolet and visible spectroscopy (UVeVis) is used to investigate the photo-catalytic behaviour of nanoparticles and nanocomposites. The results indicate that prepared nanocomposites can be used for magnetic and photo-catalytic applications, and that they can degrade azo dyes (organic dyes) when exposed to UVeVis radiation.</p>
        <p>Joulaei et al. [40] prepared MgFe 2 O 4 nano-particles with the help of sol gel method using various fruit extracts. Results indicated that at room temperature, the MgFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles exhibit ferromagnetic behaviour. Also, the formation of nanocomposite and the distribution of MgFe 2 O 4 into the polymeric matrix improved coercivity.</p>
        <p>Kiani et al. [41] formulated MgTiO 3 and MgFe 2 O 4 based nano particles microwave assisted technique and then after utilized them to MgTiO 3 and MgFe 2 O 4 based nano composites using sol gel technology. XRD and SEM were used to verify the crystallinity and purity of the materials and morphology. Vibrating sample magnetometry was used to determine the magnetic properties of the manufactured material. The results show that organic dyes photo degrade well when exposed to visible light. Our results suggest that the MgFe 2- O 4 eMgTiO 3 nanocomposite can be used for successful charge separation and charge carrier lifetime enhancement. The photo catalytic activity of this substance is higher than that of MgTiO 3 nanostructures.</p>
        <p>Moradi et al. [42] developed iron oxide-Caesium oxide nano composites in the presence of lemon extracts using hydrothermal process. Authors initially, prepared Fe 3 O 4 (iron oxide) nano particles with the help of using fast precipitation route and then introduced in the nanocomposites. XRD, SEM, vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and FTIS were used to characterize the prepared composites. Results showed that iron oxide nanoparticles exhibited super-paramagnetic behaviour. It was suggested that the prepared nanocomposites have application for photocatalytic and magnetic outcomes.</p>
        <p>Naghikhani et al. [43] formulated copper iron oxide reinforced copper oxide nano composites using water solvent method.

SEM, FTIS, etc. The results show that the nanocomposite prepared is ideal for the degradation of toxic azo dyes.</p>
        <p>Fig. 1 exhibits the scientometric chart generated through Vosviewer analytical tool which indicates that limited research has been carried out on the fabrication, Physicomechanical, scratch adhesion, tribological and morphological characterizations of AleMgeSieT6/SiC/muscovite based Hybrid metal matrix composites. This analysis indicates that AleMgeSieT6/SiC/muscovite based Hybrid metal matrix composite must be considered for application in various structural designs/prototypes and their practical usages in engineering, automotive, aerospace, bearing and other related usages. Therefore, from the above review of literature it was concluded that very few articles communicated relating to the effect of silicon carbide and hydrated aluminium potassium silicate reinforcements on the Physicomechanical, specific-wear-rate and morphological characteristics of AleMgeSieT6 Hybrid-Composite. Efforts were taken to prove that the increase in percentage of muscovite content in the stir-casting fabricated, AleMgeSieT6/SiC/muscovite based Hybrid metal matrix composite which may result in the significant increase in the wear resistance. Although it is showed in this work that the hydrated aluminium potassium silicate has substantial effect on the wear property such that when aluminosilicate particulate is added, it minimizes the wearloss and enhances the wear-resistance of the AleMgeSieT6/ SiC/hydrated aluminium potassium silicate-based Hybrid metal matrix composite.</p>
        <p>The matrix that has been used here is AleMgeSieT6 heat treated alloy. A micron size of 6 mm black silicon carbide is used as the first reinforcement and muscovite a type of hydrated aluminium potassium silicate particulates of 28 mm is taken as the second reinforcement. Three different compositions, taking 2%, 3% and 4% of muscovite flakes and 5% SiC powder as a constant required composite were fabricated.</p>
        <p>Table 1 shows the percent-weight composition of the fabricated AleMgeSieT6/SiC/hydrated aluminium potassium silicate hybrid metal-matrix composite. AleMgeSieT6 heat treated alloy was purchased from Khanna Industries, Jalandhar in the form of rods and then were cut into pieces to as per requirement of the crucible. Muscovite, a type of hydrated aluminium potassium silicate particulates was obtained for study from Delcray chemicals, Chandigarh. Tables 2 and3 shows the chemical composition of AleMgeSieT6 heat treated alloy and its mechanical properties respectively [44]. Table 4 illustrates the chemical composition of muscovite or hydrated aluminium potassium silicate.</p>
        <p>Reinforcing constituents must be uniformly dispersed in the base matrix for obtaining optimal testing results. To verify whether the distribution is uniform, a microstructure study is to be conducted [21e33]. A scanning electron microscope was performed based on its superior magnification range of 5Ã‚ to 300,000Ã‚. The surface of the specimen is to be adequately cleaned, polished, and etched before performing the micro e structural analysis.</p>
        <p>Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis was performed to indicate the particle size and shape of the powder before going to use in the composites. The morphology of reinforcement materials is shown in Fig. 2. The morphological analysis of AleMgeSieT6 heat treated alloy reveals the microdendrites structure in the peripheral with flux embedded in the AleMgeSieT6 matrix alloy state, thus identifies the particulates grain-size and corresponding dendrite crystalline growth in the continuous dispersed matrix stage with the fragment intrusion of grain refiners prevalent in the grain boundaries and grain peripherals. SEM images results that the silicon carbide particles have flaky, discrete, acicular or angular shapes and discrete with nonuniform in particle size.</p>
        <p>The muscovite particles revealed cuboidal structure that could agglomerate with several other aluminosilicate pellets and became significantly larger blocky layout. The micrographs also illustrate that the powdery hydrated aluminium potassium silicate fragments displayed a brittle patchy, elongated, flaky aggregate in morphology with relatively even, smoother texture/surface.</p>
        <p>The fabrication of composites is done by stir casting method, due to its suitability in producing uniformly distributed reinforcements. Stir casting was done using a furnace with a maximum temperature setting as 1000 C. A graphite crucible of 2 kg capacity was selected according to the furnace's dimensional specifications. The base material that is aluminium was placed inside the graphite crucible and was kept into the furnace at a temperature of 850 C which is higher than the melting point of aluminium which is around 630 C so as to obtain the molten state [12e18]. The reinforcements were also kept at the same temperature to improve its wettability with aluminium.</p>
        <p>The cylindrical rods are cut into required sizes and placed into the crucible. SiC and hydrated aluminium potassium silicate are taken in separate vessels and preheated along with the crucible in the furnace up to a temperature of 850 C. The metallic moulds of required shapes are placed in the preheated and heated up to a temperature of 500 C. After 850 C is reached the molten aluminium is taken out and 5 g of degasser is added to remove the impurities and small amount of coverall is added to prevent oxidation. For a good wettability a small amount of magnesium is added. The heated SiC and hydrated aluminium potassium silicate are added to the crucible and placed again into the furnace. The furnace is once again heated up to a temperature of 850 C [22e33]. The crucible is placed perpendicular to the stirrer and the stirrer is inserted into the crucible. The stirrer is made to stir at a speed of 300 rpm.</p>
        <p>The dies were washed utilizing emery paper, and then graphite in addition with the kerosene was applied to avoid the material from adhesion to the surface of the dies. The dies were pre-heated to a temp. of 500 C to mitigate the occurrence of shrinkage and blowholes once molten metal was pouring into it. Three different compositions were taken keeping percent weight of silicon carbide a constant 5% and increasing the muscovite percentage from 2, 3 and 4% respectively in each composition.</p>
        <p>For, preparing the specimens for wear analysis according to ASTM standards, cylindrical die of sizes of 20 mm diameter and 175 mm long were taken. Magnesium was added to compensate for the heating-loss but also to enhance the wettability among the materials. As the temperature set in the furnace was achieved the crucible was taken out, degasser and coverall were added to the molten metal to remove the impurities of the material. The reinforcing particulates were incorporated with the molten aluminium-matrix, and were placed within the furnace to attain a temp. of 850 C. Once the temperature has been attained, a stirrer was placed inside the furnace which rotate at 300 rpm such that the reinforcements was distributed uniformly. The stirring was carried-out by maintaining the constant temp. and was conducted for approximately 10-min. The resultant molten material is then started pouring into the cylindrical-dies and left to cool for 3 h after which the die was opened to acquire the specimens for dry-sliding wear analysis.</p>
        <p>The preheated metal moulds are placed over river sand. The crucible with melt is poured into the mould. The melt is poured until the metal rises from the riser. The mould is then allowed to be cooled and then the metal of the moulds shape is obtained which is then later cut into require dimensions of the specimen.</p>
        <p>Results and discussions</p>
        <p>The specimen of 10 Ã‚ 10 Ã‚ 10 mm 3 prepared as per the ASTM Standards has polished for evaluating the microstructural characterization and fracture-behaviour. The 5% volume content of Hydrofluoric acid (HF)etchant is used to etch the surface of the sample and it is washed in distilled water before carrying out SEM. Optical-Omax Metallurgical Microscope was used to characterize the morphology of AleMgeSieT6 alloy/ SiC/muscovite hybrid composites as well as reinforcedparticle dispersion of SiC and muscovite particles in AleMgeSieT6 alloy matrix.</p>
        <p>As indicated in Fig. 3(a), the particles of AleMgeSieT6 alloy/5%SiC/2% muscovite or hydrated aluminium potassium silicate sample are not homogeneously distributed and tend to be strewn about. Throughout Al solutions, the surface morphology reveals a strong inter-dendritic formation of AleSi eutectic particles. The grain-boundary void cavities were filled by composite particles. Further, from Fig. 3(b) it was observed that particles of AleMgeSieT6 alloy/5%SiC/3% muscovite sample are not homogeneously distributed and tend to be strewn about. Throughout Al solutions, the surface morphology reveals a strong inter-dendritic formation of AleSi eutectic particles. The proportion of composite particles is significantly lower, and also the matrix dispersion is uniformly homogenous. Next, Fig. 3(c) depicts the particles of AleMgeSieT6 alloy/5%SiC/4%muscovite or hydrated aluminium potassium silicate sample are not evenly dispersed yet appears to still be widely disseminated. The larger proportions of composite particulates in the metalmatrix have significantly contributed towards a larger dispersion. The composite fragments filled the latent voids, micro-cavities and cracks at the grain boundaries in polycrystalline material structure.</p>
        <p>The micrographs obtained by scanning electron microscopy show the dispersion of the reinforcement particles in the matrix as illustrated in Fig. 4(aec). The SiC particles were evenly distributed and muscovite or hydrated aluminium potassium silicate was clogged at some places. There is an agglomeration of particles. An existence of tiny openings and shallow pits is owing to the surface oxidation through a surface abrasion or grinding or etchants. The fine reinforcing particulates blended in with the matrix generate thread-like grain boundary-layers.</p>
        <p>The SEM photographs acts as evidence for the proper distribution of silicon carbide and muscovite or hydrated aluminium potassium silicate particle in the aluminium matrix. SEM and EDAX analysis have confirmed the existence of carbon (10.77% by wt.), oxygen (0.30% by wt.), aluminium (88.17% by wt.) and silicon (0.76% by wt.) [35]. Fig. 5 depicts the existence of an elemental-compositions by percent wt.</p>
        <p>Mechanical properties</p>
        <p>Tensile strength is one of the important parameters which is used to determine the applications of a material. The ASTM standard applied for tensile test was E8. The cylindrical rod casted by stir casting method is machined with respect to standard. A dumbbell shaped specimen was fixed at the ends of the universal testing machine. Tensile load was applied until the break point and the corresponding values were recorded. Table 5 shows the mechanical characteristics of AleMgeSieT6 alloy/SiC/muscovite hybrid metal matrix composite of each percent-weight compositions. Figs. 6e8 demonstrates the relationship between tensile strength, yield stress and elongation percentage of the compositions respectively. The tensile strength specimen increases from 2% of muscovite or hydrated aluminium potassium silicate composite content to 3% of it. Above 4% of muscovite, the tensile strength is observed to be decreased. This shows that 3% muscovite composition is the threshold region of AleMgeSieT6/SiC/muscovite hybrid metal matrix composite. The elongation percentage of all the threecomposition remained constant. The consistency in elongation percentage is due to constant silicon carbide 5% content. The brittleness increases with increase in SiC and thereby it is observed that 3% muscovite or hydrated aluminium potassium silicate constituent is good.</p>
        <p>For flexural testing, rectangular specimen was casted which was later machined into standard specimen. The specimen was placed over the universal testing machine and then a vertical load is applied until breakeven point and the value are recorded. Table 6 displays the flexural/bending strength of AleMgeSieT6 alloy/SiC/muscovite hybrid metal matrix composite of each percent-weight compositions.</p>
        <p>The flexural test is made to know the load at which a material starts to bend. Fig. 9 shows that the 2% muscovite or hydrated aluminium potassium silicate composite possess higher bending load than the other composites. Therefore, on increasing muscovite content, the bending load gets decreased by greater difference at first and followed minimal differences.</p>
        <p>The method of impact strength that has been applied here is charpy impact test. A standard test piece of required dimension is machined and then the test was carried out. Table 7 illustrates the Impact strength of AleMgeSieT6 alloy/SiC/ muscovite hybrid metal matrix composite of each percentweight compositions.</p>
        <p>The toughness of the composites obtained through charpy impact tester portrays that the toughness of the composite decreases at first and then increases as revealed in Fig. 10. The yield strength of the composite decreases as the composition of muscovite or hydrated aluminium potassium silicate increases.</p>
        <p>Brinell hardness test was carried out with a finely polished plate surface. The workpiece was placed below diamond indentor and three sets of impressions were made and, on an average, the Brinell Hardness Number (BHN) was obtained. Table 8 exhibits the Hardness of AleMgeSieT6 alloy/SiC/ muscovite hybrid metal matrix composite of each percentweight compositions.</p>
        <p>Three impressions were made on the specimen of each composition in different places so as to get the aggregate value of hardness of the sample.</p>
        <p>The hardness result obtained by Brinell Hardness test from Fig. 11, shows that the composition with 3% of muscovite or hydrated aluminium potassium silicate content possessed higher hardness than other two compositions. It shows that with increasing hydrated aluminium potassium silicate content, the hardness of aluminium silicon carbide decreases. As this decrease in hardness, improves the machinability of the composite, thus shows muscovite a good substitute for Al/SiC composite as a hardness reducing agent. Muscovite or hydrated aluminium potassium silicate will be a good substitute for graphite because of its ductile nature.</p>
        <p>The effect of various volume fraction (0e20 vol.%) and grain size (29, 45, 110 mm) on the hardness in squeeze casted Al (2014)-SiC composites and results revealed that the hardness value of newly developed composites follows proportionally trend w.r.t. weight fraction of SiC because of their hardness as reported by Sahin [45].</p>
        <p>The true as well as actual densities of the composites were determined, and also the porosity rate for each composite was computed. An actual density was measured by utilizing Mettler Toledo set-up in accordance with the Archimedes' concept (equation (1)), and true density was estimated by using theory of mixtures (equation ( 2)). Equation ( 3) is then used to evaluate the porosity value.</p>
        <p>Fig. 12 depicts the impact of SiC and muscovite inclusions on the porosity as well as density of hybrid Al-MMC's. The composite materials had reported higher density than that of the base matrix, as per the findings. It was because of the massive dense and compact nature of the SiC and muscovite fragments within a base-matrix granular size structure. In Ale5SiCe3muscovite MMC, there is a modest increase in porosity, which enhances with escalating muscovite contents. It is due to the cluster aggregation as well as uneven erratic distribution of particulate elements. This rise in permeability or porosity could be owing to the higher density of muscovite, air and gas trapped with constituent fragments during mixing, casting shrinkage throughout solidifications, or molecular hydrogen-evolution.</p>
        <p>The Micro-scratch tests on the composites were performed to assess both the surface-integrity as well as mechanical performance using scratch-adhesion analyzer in reference to the ASTM C-1624 standard, and the resulting traction force was measured. The three-scratch test-trials per specimen were conducted for accuracy perspective, and then an average reading was taken. The parameters in context with the testing are exhibits in Table 9.</p>
        <p>Prior to carry-out test, the specimen was burr-free and smoothed utilizing different grades of an abrasive emerysand paper. The evident abrasive frictional coefficient (m a ) was computed by dividing the traction-force with the normal-load.</p>
        <p>Results reported that the scratch test was conducted for the (3%), and Al Ã¾ SiC (5%) Ã¾ muscovite (4%) based MMCs, and the surface-quality in the form of an abrasive frictional coefficient as well as traction force was measured in comparison with the base matrix (traction force Â¼ 8.77 N and abrasive frictional coefficient Â¼ 0.4385), respectively. The findings of a scratch test indicate that traction force is improved by escalating the reinforcement content in the matrices with a slight improvement in the apparent abrasive frictional coefficient as indicated in Fig. 13. This enhancement of traction strength ascribes to significantly harder SiC and muscovite particles, which prevent the patching, adhesion, and scraping of sample surface-layer. The results of inline trials were revealed for micro-hardness. Chandla et al. [46] had prepared alumina and bagasse ash reinforced Al (6061 alloy) based composites using stir casting. Results revealed that hardness increased with increasing bagasse ash up to 6% and then decreased; however, the achieved value is more than that of unreinforced aluminium alloy. Similar trend was observed in the strength variation. Moreover, inclusion of bagasse ash reduced impact strength and ductility. The increasing trend of porosity level was also reported with respect to the reinforcement contents [47].</p>
        <p>Tribological studies</p>
        <p>Wear is one of the important tribological properties that play a major role in deciding the use of the material. There are various methods used to check wear loss in a material, of which a pin on drum type apparatus was selected. This test simulates the wear that occurs during crushing and grinding action which happens to produce a more realistic result when compared to other methods. The wear-resistant is determined by sliding a test specimen over the substrate of an abrasive layer sheet attached to a rotating drum and has been measured as volumetric wear-loss in mm3. The confirmatory testing samples are polished and then machined in accordance with ASTM requirements D 5963-96 according to which a cylindrical sample of 15.8 mm diameter and 10 mm thickness is required. The test method is performed under specified conditions using a cylinder drum of 150 mm diameter, sliding distance of 500 mm, equivalent revolution of 84 times, rotational frequency of 40 rpm, and different contact pressures of 1, 2 and 3 kg. An Abrasion tester is mainly comprised of a machine framework which supports a laterally interchangeable/ adjustable test-specimen holding carrier, a rotating columnar cylindric drum to which an abrasive layer is being affixed. An Aluminium oxide or corundum is used as the abrasive paper with a grit size of 60. The test piece is initially weighed and then fitted in the holder which is loaded with the given contact pressure. The drive system is operated to rotate the drum in clockwise direction. The holder is made to move laterally from right to left so that the material encounters the grain faces of the abrasives. After the test piece reaches the end of the drum, it is removed and is weighed. The difference in the weight gives us the weight loss of the material due to wear. When the difference in weight is divided by the initial weight of the material before wear, the wear loss of the material can be determined.</p>
        <p>Three different compositions are taken to determine the effect of increase in muscovite or hydrated aluminium potassium silicate on the wear property of AleMgeSieT6/SiC composite as demonstrate in Table 10. Three different loading were also done for each composition to determine the effect of increase in load.</p>
        <p>Fig. 14 shows the variation of wear loss present in each composition by varying the loading conditions. It is a wellknown fact that as the contact pressure between any two surfaces increases, the wear loss between them also increases. This can be well seen in each of the compositions. As the contact pressure is increased the wear loss also increases. From the graph, it is also observable than the wear loss decreases from first composition to third composition. This is mainly because of the increase in muscovite/hydrated aluminium potassium silicate percentage, as the percentage of silicon carbide is kept as a constant. Kumar et al. [6] conducted a comparative study for Al6061/SiC and Al7075/Al 2 O 3 AMCs in terms of hardness, tensile strength and wear resistance. The composites are prepared using the technique of liquid metallurgy, in which 2 to 6 weight percentage of particulate matter is dispersed in the base matrix as 2 units step up. It is found that the micro hardness of the composites is increased with the increase in filler material, and the hardness of Al 6061eSiC and Al 7075eAl 2 O 3 is found to be 97VHN and 80e109VHN, respectively. The composites' tensile strength properties are found to be higher than that of the base matrix. The composites Al 6061eSiC have higher tensile resistance characteristics than the composites Al 7075eAl 2 O 3 . For Al 6061eSiC composites the wear resistance of the composite is higher due to SiC's contribution to enhancing wear resistance.</p>
        <p>SEM analysis was conducted on the specimens examined under sliding wear. Fig. 15(aec) exhibit SEM pictures after wear analysis of worn-out surfaces of the muscovite or hydrated aluminium potassium silicate-reinforced AleMgeSieT6/SiC hybrid metal matrix composites. Such micrographs illustrate several long ridges, sharp edges, indentations, pitting and craters on deteriorated (eroded) areas at a sliding speed of 0.314159 m/s, with load rises to 29.42 N. When the applied load increases, the composite wear behaviour vicissitudes from abrasion to delaminating fracture failure as revealed through the SEM micrographs. The lines of crevices, slits, deep depression grooves and delamination were the evidence of permanent plastic distortion or deformation, as shown in Fig. 15(aec). When the percent-weight proportion/concentration of muscovite or aluminosilicate increases, the wear resistance initially decreases, and after then eventually increases. The wavywear trace/mark obviously indicates the prevalence of oxidized thin-layer coating, often implies the frictional heat is generated by the relative motion among metal pins as well as steel discs surface, and thus severely impairs the wear-rate of steel pins. The findings reported in this experimental research study encounters the predominance of endogenous oxidative fretting wear at atmospheric room temperature.</p>
        <p>These are uniformly homogeneously dispersed around the worn deteriorated layer and inevitably break down off and be detritus debris/fragments. During wear the frictional heat responds quite effectively to the oxidization and degradation of the fine smoother debris as compared to rough denser wear fragments. Similar results had been observed in the AleB 4 C-Mica hybrid composites using stir casting route with an aim to evaluate characteristic properties, and machinability with the help of drilling process [48]. Results indicated that Mica particles make it possible to glide between the different elements of the drilled hole and increases localized dislocation of base alloy and chips. High value of hardness was obtained near the drilled surface due to strain hardening, which increases with increasing B4C contents and decreases with increasing process parameters [48]. 4.</p>
        <p>Aluminium reinforced with silicon carbide is the vital composite with less machinability characteristics. To improve the properties of AleMgeSieT6, based-composite various material is reinforced by researchers. The experimental results show that muscovite or hydrated aluminium potassium silicate or Aluminosilicate is a good substitute to soften the (Al/ SiC/muscovite) hybrid metal matrix composite. Based upon an experimentation, the subsequent outcomes were being elucidated as followed.</p>
        <p>i. It was observed that fabrication of AleMgeSieT6/SiC/ muscovite hybrid metal matrix composite can be accomplished using stir casting method. The micrographs obtained from SEM proved that the dispersion of reinforcement particles was finer with stir casting method. SEM exposed good interfacial bonding, less agglomeration with uniform distribution, less voids. EDS spectra affirms the presence of reinforcing constituents (SiC and muscovite or hydrated aluminium potassium silicate particulates) within AleMgeSieT6/ SiC/muscovite hybrid metal matrix composite. The grain boundaries show the mixing of particles with little clusters of particles. ii. The hardness of the compositions first increases and then decreases with higher hardness in 3% muscovite composition. The toughness of the composition first decreases and then increases. The tensile strength of the composition increases from 2% to 3% composition followed by a fall in 4% muscovite or hydrated aluminium potassium silicate composition. The flexural load for bending first decrease followed by an increase. The composite materials had reported higher density than that of the base matrix, as per the findings. It was because of the massive dense and compact nature of the SiC and muscovite fragments within a basematrix granular size structure. In Ale5SiCe3muscovite MMC, there is a modest increase in porosity, which enhances with escalating muscovite contents. It is due to the cluster aggregation as well as uneven erratic distribution of particulate elements. iii. The findings of a scratch test indicate that traction force is improved by escalating the reinforcement content in the matrices with a slight improvement in the apparent abrasive frictional coefficient. This enhancement of traction strength ascribes to significantly harder SiC and muscovite particles, which prevent the patching, adhesion, and scraping of sample surface-layer. iv. The 3% composition of muscovite or hydrated aluminium potassium silicate is the better reinforcement that showed an effective property. As a result of which the percentage of reinforcement was kept to be lesser than 10%. If the percentages of reinforcements are increased, uniform distribution cannot be achieved and the specified percentage composition cannot be obtained. From the SEM micrographs, it is clear that the reinforcements have been uniformly distributed in all the three compositions. v. Results revealed that the wear loss decreases as the muscovite percentage content has been increased. Thus, it is proved that hydrated aluminium potassium silicate has an effect on wear property such that when muscovite particulate is added it reduces the wear loss and increases the wear resistance of the material. vi. The microstructural analysis of the worn surface of AleMgeSieT6/SiC/muscovite or hydrated aluminium potassium silicate hybrid metal matrix composite reveals that the abrasive behaviour is in the context of dry-sliding or swaying mechanism. For hybrid composite materials, the particulate wear detritus/rubble is fine-grained and more even-refined as compared to the standard traditional materials.</p>
        <p>The composites produced may be further investigated for their resistance to corrosion, including various thermal and electrical measurements. This would facilitate to broaden their field of application in various structural designs/prototypes and their practical usages in engineering.</p>
        <p>i. Composite wear behaviour can be further examined throughout diverse environmental conditions, such as in lubricating regimes and harsh corrosive environments where temperature difference can be attained. ii. The influence of heat-treatment on the wear-behaviour of composite may also be explored to have extensive applicability. iii. High cyclic-fatigue and controlled-strain rate characteristics of the fabricated composite being built could be identified to broaden the scope of using rutile composite with muscovite as reinforcing constituents for several defence applications.</p>
