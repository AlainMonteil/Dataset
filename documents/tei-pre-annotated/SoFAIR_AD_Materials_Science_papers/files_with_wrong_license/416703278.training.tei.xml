        <p>The applications of natural products are widespread in food, cosmetics, perfumes and pharmaceutical industries. Many natural products are also used in textiles to improve the textures of fibrous materials for multipurpose applications. Chitosan (deacetylated chitin) is such a product, typically found in exoskeletons of arthropods and crustaceans and also in fungal cell walls. It is a polycationic polysaccaride compound which has a tendency to interact with other chemicals resulting in various novel morphologies of microcapsules. The rigid chemical structure of chitosan makes it suitable in forming films, gels and microcapsules. Moreover, its biological, chemical and physical properties make it viable for developing the microcapsules containing active ingredients [1].The applications of natural products are widespread in food, cosmetics, perfumes and pharmaceutical industries.

        <p>A microcapsule comprises of a core and a shell matrix, the core contains active ingredient whereas the shell is either a polymeric or a waxy material. The preparation of microcapsules depends on various parameters such as solubility, viscosity and the emulsification behaviour of the reaction mixture. Once applied on a desirable site, the active ingredients are inclined to be released under controlled conditions. The shell behaves as a transferring channel to the target where it releases the active ingredients which in turn depend on the material used for the shell formation including its specific end uses [2]. Microencapsulation allows the control release of the active ingredient for deposition at targeted site under specific conditions to carry out the required functionality. Any external chemical, physical or mechanical stimulant can be applied on microcapsule to tune the controlled release of active ingredient.A microcapsule comprises of a core and a shell matrix, the core contains active ingredient whereas the shell is either a polymeric or a waxy material.

        <p>Chitosan coated microcapsules are used for the protection of active ingredients from external factors such as temperature and pH variations. Different types of core materials such as active pharmaceutical ingredients, food products, catalysts, oils and pigments can be microencapsulated using chitosan as shell material [3]. Chemically, chitosan contains free amine groups either in neutral or basic media whereas protonated amines are formed in acidic media. This pH sensitive feature makes the chitosan based compounds suitable in controlled release technologies [4].Chitosan coated microcapsules are used for the protection of active ingredients from external factors such as temperature and pH variations.

        <p>Chitosan microcapsules containing drugs as an active ingredient allow their slow release under specific conditions at the targeted sites in the body. For example, lipophilic drugs were encapsulated in chitosan to be effectively released latterly in the intestinal tract of the human body [5]. Similarly, chitosan microencapsulation of vaccines allows their delivery and controlled release on the targeted sites. Fish, neem seed and other essential oils had also been microencapsulated in chitosan to limit their rate of oxidation [6]. Chitosan chains can be crosslinked with glutaraldehyde or citric acid for astaxanthin microencapsulation to increase its antioxidant potential [7]. Chitosan encapsulation of quercetin flavonoids has also been reported to allow their control release targeted as an inflammation therapy [8].Chitosan microcapsules containing drugs as an active ingredient allow their slow release under specific conditions at the targeted sites in the body.

        <p>Chitosan is a linear polysaccharide of [(1→4)-β-linked 2-amino-2-deoxy-d-glucose] that is slightly hydrophilic in nature. Crabs, shrimps and some other crustaceans' shells contain chitin (β-(1→4)-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine) which upon reacting with alkaline sodium hydroxide give an N-deacetylation product, known as chitosan [9]. The process of deacetylation of chitin to produce chitosan is presented in Fig. 1.Chitosan is a linear polysaccharide of [(1→4)-β-linked 2-amino-2-deoxy-d-glucose] that is slightly hydrophilic in nature.

        <p>Generally, microencapsulation involves the formation of minute capsules which entrap some active ingredient under some specific conditions and releasing them under other suitable conditions. The encapsulation of active ingredients can be improved by rendering liquids into powders and preventing their clumping which results in protecting active ingredients from oxidation, heat, acidity, alkalinity, moisture or evaporation. It also prevents them from reacting with unwanted species which may induce degradation or polymerization in the system. Encapsulation can also be used for masking unpleasant odour; improving handling of ingredients before processing; releasing active material in controlled manners and finally protecting workers from exposure to toxins [10].Generally, microencapsulation involves the formation of minute capsules which entrap some active ingredient under some specific conditions and releasing them under other suitable conditions.

        <p>The products of microencapsulation are microparticles, microcapsules and microspheres as shown in Fig. 2.

        <p>Microcapsules contain active ingredients surrounded by shells while the microspheres are the matrixes containing active ingredients dispersed inside them. Microparticles vary their size in range from 100 to 1000 nm. Capsules with 1 to 1000 μm diameter are termed as microcapsules [11]. A microcapsule is comprised of two parts; a core and a shell. Further, shell materials include polymers, fats, waxes and carbohydrates. Their selection mainly depends on the nature of the core material and the applications of the microcapsule.Microcapsules contain active ingredients surrounded by shells while the microspheres are the matrixes containing active ingredients dispersed inside them.

        <p>The selection of a suitable microencapsulation approach depends on the nature and physicochemical properties of the encapsulated material. The core material of microcapsule may be an adsorbent particle, suspension of solid or an emulsion [13]. It should be inaccessible to the surrounding media from unwanted chemical to prevent its deterioration [14]. The encapsulating agents are very important for the microcapsules' stability and efficiency. The criterion for the selection of the encapsulating material depends upon its properties such as compatibility of the shell materials, the structure of the encapsulating agents and the economic and processing aspects involved. One type of a microencapsulating agent may not have all the required properties; therefore, combinations of different microencapsulating agents can be adopted for better production of microcapsules. The choice of an encapsulating agent also depends on the toxicity level, stability, efficiency, protection degree and microscopic properties of the produced micro-particles [12].The selection of a suitable microencapsulation approach depends on the nature and physicochemical properties of the encapsulated material.

        <p>There are three different morphologies of microcapsules which include mononuclear, polynuclear and matrix encapsulation as shown in Fig. 2. The mononuclear microcapsules comprise of shell material surrounding the core material whereas the polynuclear microcapsules contain a shell material surrounding several cores. The matrix encapsulation involves the fine dispersion of core material into the shell material. The basic structures for microcapsule may also contain mononuclear core with multiple shells or microcapsules clusters [15]. The morphology of microcapsules depends on the nature and composition of both core and shell materials and their mode of interaction. The morphology of microcapsules is typically controlled by existing conditions such as temperature, pH and the method used in their preparation.There are three different morphologies of microcapsules which include mononuclear, polynuclear and matrix encapsulation as shown in Fig. 2.

        <p>Core material can either be a liquid or solid coated with polymers, waxes, polysaccharides or proteins depending on the requirement of the produced microcapsule. The dispersed or dissolved materials are typically included in liquid cores whereas active constituents, stabilizers, diluents, excipients and release retardants or accelerators are included in the solid core. The varying composition of the core material provides flexible characteristics to develop the desired properties in a microcapsule. The specific coating/shell on the surface of core material provide suitable physical and chemical properties to the microcapsules. This coating material on the surface of core material should be chemically non-reactive so as not to alter the chemical composition of the core material. The desired properties are achieved in the coating material such as flexibility, impermeability, strength, stability and optical properties etc. [16].Core material can either be a liquid or solid coated with polymers, waxes, polysaccharides or proteins depending on the requirement of the produced microcapsule.

        <p>The selection of coating material is a very important step in the encapsulation process because it may have decisive effect on the functional properties of the final encapsulated product.

        <p>Microencapsulation approaches can be categorized into chemical, physical and mechanical techniques. Chemical microencapsulation is a versatile method for the encapsulation of drugs. It is further subdivided into complex coacervation, interfacial polymerization and in situ polymerization. The coacervation is a phase separation technique with two liquid phases. One phase is called as coacervation phase usually containing polymers while other do not have polymer. The process completes in three steps; in the first step, a polymer of oppositely charged precipitate and process is called complex coacervation. In second step, coacervate is deposited on the dispersed phase, containing active ingredients, and in the third step, the polymer film gets hardened [10]. In the interfacial polymerization, a reactive polymer is dissolved in two immiscible liquids and the polymerization take place at the interface [20]; while in the in situ polymerization, solution of shell material is added into the core phase and the deposition of polymer of core material takes place by changes in the pH or temperate [21]. Some advantages and disadvantages of these techniques have been compared in Table 3.Microencapsulation approaches can be categorized into chemical, physical and mechanical techniques.

        <p>The microencapsulation process is generally divided into three major stages. In the first stage, some active constituents are incorporated into the matrix or the core of microcapsules which may be in the form of emulsions or suspensions. In the second stage, the liquid form of the matrix makes a dispersion and the solid matrix through spraying a solution under agitation. In the last stage, droplets are stabilized by different physicochemical approaches. The releasing mechanism of the core material depends upon the nature of stimulant and the morphology of microcapsules.The microencapsulation process is generally divided into three major stages.

        <p>Various studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of the above-mentioned parameter on chitosan encapsulation efficiency. For instance, some researchers [26] had encapsulated cortex moutan (a drug for hypertension treatment) in chitosan and investigated the effect of chitosan concentration on its encapsulating efficiency, it was observed that when the chitosan concentration was increased from 2 to 6% (w/v) its encapsulating efficiency increased significantly. They concluded that when the concentration of shell material increased the diffusion of drug decrease, accordingly. While studying the effect of ratio of active ingredient to encapsulating material, Devi and co-workers [27] observed that when ratio of core to shell material decreased form 1/50 to 1/300, the encapsulation efficient increased significantly.Various studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of the above-mentioned parameter on chitosan encapsulation efficiency.

        <p>Chitosan is the second most abundant natural biopolymer after cellulose and it has several amino and hydroxyl functional groups [30]. Due to the presence of positive charge on its amino groups, chitosan is the only commercially available water-soluble cationic polymer so far [31]. Furthermore, chitosan is pH sensitive due to the presence of D-glucosamine in its structure. These unique properties make chitosan an important shell material to entrap various active ingredients suitable for several applications in different fields. Many drugs can be encapsulated for targeted delivery approaches. Active food ingredients can also be encapsulated to protect them from microbial attack and to enhance their nutritional value. Chitosan can also be used to encapsulate vitamins for their applications in foods, cosmetotextiles and pharmaceutical industry.Chitosan is the second most abundant natural biopolymer after cellulose and it has several amino and hydroxyl functional groups [30].

Therein, FTIR and SEM confirmed the cross-linking within microcapsules. The concentration of chitosan and essential oil had determined the extent of antibacterial activity. The stiffness increased at higher concentration of chitosan and was decreased on increasing the essential oil concentration [37].Essential oils were encapsulated into chitosan microsphere (as shown in Fig. 4) to investigate their releasing property with chitosan/k-carrageenan microspheres.

        <p>The microspheres of NSO in a polyelectrolyte complex of chitosan and carrageenan had been prepared using complex coacervation as shown in Fig 5 . The surface of the microcapsules became irregular as more oil was encapsulated inside them [6]. The burst release of NSO became more gradual on increasing the polymer concentration, the percentage of oil and the concentration of glutaraldehyde as crosslinking agent. The DSC analysis showed an absence of any interrelation and poor compatibility between the polyelectrolyte complex of chitosan and the carrageenan [38]. Chitosan and κ carrageenan were used to encapsulate NSO using three different cross-linkers (i.e., genipin, glutaraldehyde and tannic acid) to compare their effect on the release behaviour of the microcapsules. Therein, glutaraldehyde was found to be the best cross-linker to improve thermal stability, release behaviour and water uptake capacity of chitosan microcapsules [39]. Both FTIR and the DSC analyses confirmed the absence of chemical interaction in microcapsules, but the release of NSO was entirely dependent on the cross-linker. The more the cross-linking agent used the less release of NSO occurred. I has therefore been concluded that microencapsulation of NSO can effectively be used as pesticides, insecticide and herbicide [40].The microspheres of NSO in a polyelectrolyte complex of chitosan and carrageenan had been prepared using complex coacervation as shown in Fig 5 .

        <p>Long-chain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5 ω3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6 ω3), are important to prevent cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, allergies and Alzheimer's diseases [44]. The ability to microencapsulation of fish oils is therefore important to increase the nutritional value for such necessary food products. The stability and shelf life of fish oil and other bioactive and food components was improved by chitosan encapsulation preventing their auto-oxidation as compared to bulk storage. Such encapsulation had no significant effect on its in-vivo digestibility [41][42][43]. Therefore, some long-chain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids isolated from fish oil were microencapsulated into chitosan shell using spray drying technique to reduce their susceptibility to ambient oxidation. The results showed enhanced stability and storage duration for these fish oil extract [44]. In a study, chitosan encapsulation of fish oil was also done using an ultrasonic atomizer through an emulsification method. As a result chitosan was not only capable to give a stable emulsion but its stability was enhanced with mediated with maltodextrin [45]. Likewise, milk originated shell materials had also been used to encapsulate fish oils using spray drying technique resulting in an increased encapsulation efficiency by increasing the temperature of inlet used for drying air to reduce moisture contents [46].Long-chain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5 ω3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6 ω3), are important to prevent cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, allergies and Alzheimer's diseases [44].

        <p>Chitosan had also been accepted as an effective method for α-lipoic acid (ALA) encapsulation. It prevents decomposition of ALA at elevated temperatures and provides an efficient delivery process. ALA was encapsulated in dry chitosan microbeads by swelling them in its respective solution. FTIR and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses revealed interaction of hydroxyl/amino groups of chitosan with the carboxylic acid groups of ALA. Its encapsulation efficiency was observed in the range from 46.8 to 58.5%. The retention of the non-extractable ALA in the chitosan medium could deliver a continuous release of this antioxidant for a long period [47]. Liposomes containing coenzyme Q10 and ALA coated by chitosan were efficiently compared with uncoated liposomes. Hydrogen bonding and ionic interactions in chitosan-coated liposomes with ALA were enhanced showing effective radical scavenging capacity and sustained drug release behaviour [48]. The ALA-chitosan complex was formed showing ALA release due to changes in pH values. The ALA is used for energy production in the mitochondria acting as a cofactor. Its stability had been improved by chitosan encapsulation for safe release in the gastrointestinal tract [49]. The ALA had also been encapsulated in poly (ethylene oxide)/chitosan using single-capillary electrospray system. Excellent dispersity and stability of particles in suspension was observed under DLS based zeta potential measurements. The results demonstrated effective anti-inflammatory activity for poly(ethylene oxide)-chitosan coated ALA in comparison to free ALA solutions [50].Chitosan had also been accepted as an effective method for α-lipoic acid (ALA) encapsulation.

This does not only protect them from harsh external environment but also provide them with more effective properties and improve their bioactive roles in the human body.

        <p>A microfluidic approach had been used to prepare double emulsion precursor for burst release of a hydrophobic drug coated with chitosan in acidic medium [51]. Chitosan is soluble in acid media while in neutral and basic media, chitosan microcapsules remain insoluble and maintain their morphologies. Thus, the microcapsules could decompose its shell in acidic media releasing their active ingredients making them suitable to target areas such as the stomach at pH&lt;4. Any pH fluctuations greatly influence the properties of chitosan microcapsules [52]. Likewise, metronidazole is an antibiotic which is used to treat bacterial infection on skin, stomach and joints and is also used to treat inflammatory bowel disease [53]. It had been encapsulated in alginate beads mediated with different chitosan concentrations to develop some mucoadhesive properties. The encapsulation efficiency, surface morphology, swelling behaviour, and in vitro and in vivo drug release profiles were assessed. Subsequently, it was observed that chitosan with high concentration showed efficient encapsulation and controlled drug release rate at pH 7.4 with extend exposure period [54]. Tissue engineering helps improve the functions lost due to some pathological condition and damaged or diseased tissues [55]. Chitosan is an important material for tissue engineering and wound dressing application due to its biocompatibility [56]. Karpuraranjith and co-workers [57] had synthesized chitosan-g-β-cyclodextrin (chit-gβ-CD) scaffolds using freeze drying approach as active filling material during the treatment of damaged tissues. The β-CD made it efficient for drug loading as it improved the swelling behaviour of chitosan by decreasing its degree of hydrogen bonding. Ketoprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug which was encapsulated in chit-g-β-CD and its loading efficiency was observed to be increased at high concentration of chit-g-β-CD because β-CD increases the hydrophobic interaction with the ketoprofen molecules.A microfluidic approach had been used to prepare double emulsion precursor for burst release of a hydrophobic drug coated with chitosan in acidic medium [51].

        <p>The kinetic study showed that at initial stage, the drug release rate was high due to the presence of possible uncoated drug at the surface of shell. The drug release rate become slow and equilibrium was observed after 23 h. The slow release of the drug was due to complex formation between drug and the chit-g-β-CD. The nontoxic behaviour made it efficient for cross-linking of glutaraldehyde against the fibroblasts (L929) cells and the chit-g-β-CD; therefore, has become an important scaffold for tissue engineering applications.The kinetic study showed that at initial stage, the drug release rate was high due to the presence of possible uncoated drug at the surface of shell.

        <p>Chitosan is also used for non-viral gene delivery. Chitosan contains slightly positive charge in acidic media which allows the attachment of nucleic acids to the cationic chitosan. The DNA, siRNA and nanoparticles of nucleic acid could therefore be attached to chitosan for genes delivery [58]. However, its poor solubility in water makes it less efficient when compared with other synthetic cationic polymer such as polyethylenimine (PEI) and poly-L-lysine (PLL) [59].Chitosan is also used for non-viral gene delivery.

        <p>Haemoglobin is an important constituent of blood carrying oxygen towards cells and tissues. For oral bioavailability of haemoglobin, encapsulation approach has been more efficient and protect it from desaturating at high temperatures and in organic solvents. The proposed process of haemoglobin encapsulation in chitosan is shown in Fig. 6. The microencapsulation was investigated to determine if it may increase the oxygen carrying capacity and the in vitro releasing behaviour of haemoglobin [64]. Therein, freeze-dried bovine haemoglobin was encapsulated using chitosan or calcium alginate beads. The procedure was optimized for the formation of beads containing more than 90% of initial haemoglobin contents. The haemoglobin dissociates into its monomer and was released at pH 1.2 due to loss of interaction between negatively charged alginate and positively charged haemoglobin that exists at pH 5.5. Globular proteins and cells could be encapsulated using this method [65].Haemoglobin is an important constituent of blood carrying oxygen towards cells and tissues.

        <p>In another study alginate beads containing microencapsulated haemoglobin were coated with a dextran derivative for comparison between dextran and the chitosan. On changing the media pH from 3 to 4, the bonding interaction between beads and haemoglobin weakened ultimately releasing the haemoglobin. Dextran allowed slower haemoglobin release in comparison to chitosan [66]. The in vitro releasing behaviour of haemoglobin was evaluated using chitosan coating in three different conditions, namely uncoated, incomplete and completely coated microspheres. In the gastrointestinal tract, haemoglobin was quickly released from the uncoated and incomplete coated microspheres at pH 6.8 while the complete coating gave a slower release even at pH 1.2 [67].

A solvent evaporation method was used for the microencapsulation of astaxanthin in the chitosan using glutaraldehyde as a cross-linker. Microcapsules in powdered form were obtained with diameter in the range of 5-50 µm. The stability of these microcapsules was investigated under different storage conditions at temperatures 25, 35 and 45 o C for 8 weeks.Astaxanthin is a ketocarotenoid belonging to the terpenes class with antioxidant potential of 100 times greater than the β-tocopherol to protect skin against cancer and is used as antiinflammatory and immunostimulants agent [68].

The kinetic study showed that quercetin release delayed from the chitosan-based film when irradiated with an electron beam of 2.2 MeV energy. Such irradiation produced free radicals which helped crosslinking between chitosan film and the quercetin which increased the stability of encapsulated quercetin due to more linkage with the chitosan. This also prevented the burst release of core material from the biopolymeric matrix [75].Chitosan and xanthan gum were used within microencapsulated quercetin to ensure its controlled release in the colon for inflammation therapy [74].

        <p>The sources of vitamin C include citrus fruits and green vegetables [81]. Vitamin C sensitivity towards pH, temperature and heat cause its spoilage in food therefore microencapsulation may help protect it from oxidative environments [78]. Spray drying technique has been used for encapsulating vitamin C (as shown in Fig. 7) because it causes minimum loss of ascorbic acid, both thermal phase separation and melt dispersion are effective for its release [82]. STPP was used as cross linker for encapsulation of vitamin C in double layered chitosan structure which proved effective for its controlled release in the gastric secretions and the intestinal fluids. It was observed that the encapsulation efficiency decreased on increasing the concentration of the crosslinking agent; this may be due to surface irregularities of chitosan.

        <p>Vitamin D exists in two main chemical forms; the first form is known as vitamin D3 or cholecalciferol while the second form is D2 ergocholecalciferol. The skin of the human body is able to synthesize vitamin D3 upon exposure to sunlight. Calciol, calcidiol and calcitriol are different forms of vitamin D3 which is important for bone metabolism, blood pressure, immunity, insulin secretion and homeostasis [84]. The second form D2 is present in food matrixes and can be released to form mixed micelles because it is lipophilic in nature. It enters in enterocytes, chylomicrons and the liver where it is activated for use as deficiency causes rickets, osteomalacia, fatigue and depression [85]. Carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) and soy protein isolate (SPI) complex nanoparticles had been studied to check the effect of Ca 2+ concentration, pH and CMCS/SPI mass ratio. Vitamin D3 was encapsulated into CMCS/SPI polymeric complex. Lower concentration of Ca 2+ was required for CMCS/SPI complex in comparison with CMCS for broad range of pH values. The encapsulation efficiency of the complex nanoparticles was high due to its compact structure. Vitamin D3 release was observed to be significantly higher under simulated intestinal conditions in comparison with gastric fluids. The use CMCS/SPI complex nanoparticles were reported to be suitable for both encapsulation and controlled release of bioactive and hydrophobic nutraceuticals [86] .Vitamin D exists in two main chemical forms; the first form is known as vitamin D3 or cholecalciferol while the second form is D2 ergocholecalciferol. The skin of the human body is able to synthesize vitamin D3 upon exposure to sunlight. Calciol, calcidiol and calcitriol are different forms of vitamin D3 which is important for bone metabolism, blood pressure, immunity, insulin secretion and homeostasis [84]. The second form D2 is present in food matrixes and can be released to form mixed micelles because it is lipophilic in nature. It enters in enterocytes, chylomicrons and the liver where it is activated for use as deficiency causes rickets, osteomalacia, fatigue and depression [85]. Carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) and soy protein isolate (SPI) complex nanoparticles had been studied to check the effect of Ca 2+ concentration, pH and CMCS/SPI mass ratio.

        <p>Stearic acid (SA) and oleic acids (OA) were used in 70:30 (v/v) for the encapsulation of vitamin D due to their compatibility, stability and higher encapsulation efficiency. Chitosan coated NLCs showed excellent stability and storage without expulsion of vitamin D. It was concluded that a physically stable system was obtained after encapsulation of vitamin D. Tan et al.

        <p>Alpha tocopherol (vitamin E) is an environmental friendly dark viscous yellowish-brown oily substance with exceptional thermal stability and limited volatility [89]. Alpha tocopherol is important for food packaging to keep items afresh. It is present in different foods to protect lipids from auto oxidation and thus, increasing their shelf life. Its nature is hydrophobic and gives intense response in heat, oxygen and light. Its hydrophobicity minimize its applications in different fields of life [90]. It plays important role in the protection of skin from harmful UVlight through absorption while giving antioxidant defence to the skin [91]. Both retinoic acid and alpha tocopherol are highly effective for dry skin but has limitations for use in cosmetics due to their sensitivity towards light and oxygen and some adverse reactions in localized areas such as erythema, xerosis and mild scaling. These problems could be controlled by their microencapsulation in chitosan shells, which protects from heat and light exposure. For topical applications, skin irritation can be minimized by incorporating retinoic acid and alpha tocopherol in chitosan microspheres. The stability and release time cam be increased for chitosan containing vitamins giving thermodynamically favourable applications [92] .Alpha tocopherol (vitamin E) is an environmental friendly dark viscous yellowish-brown oily substance with exceptional thermal stability and limited volatility [89].

        <p>The microencapsulation also protects the alpha tocopherol as a core material to regulate the delivery process [93]. The presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the biological membrane makes them susceptible to oxidation by free radicals. Alpha tocopherol protects the membrane by converting the free radicals into stable species through their hydrogen bonding. The esterification process also gives stability to alpha-tocopherol but this molecule is at a risk of long term degradation [94]. Kaleem et al.

        <p>The pH of most cosmetics has a range 5.5 to 7; therefore, these cosmetics must be encapsulated to allow the controlled release of different active agents. In drug delivery, chitosan is used as a coating material giving many advantages such as bio-adhesive properties, improvement and sustained drug release [100]. In a study investigating diclofenac release, 50% occurred within one hour when using uncoated microspheres while only 14.6% with the chitosan coated microparticles [101]. An exciting application of chitosan had been reported with calcium phosphate as a cementing agent where chitosan glycerophosphate combines with calcium phosphate and citric acid to form a self-hardening system for bone filling and repairing [102] .The pH of most cosmetics has a range 5.5 to 7; therefore, these cosmetics must be encapsulated to allow the controlled release of different active agents.

        <p>Chitosan membranes offer excellent permeability and high tensile strength making it suitable to use as an artificial kidney membrane [103]. The novel semipermeable membrane was established for better control of blood compatibility and transport materials. Patients who suffer from skin problems or severe infections and fluid loss, can be treated using chitosan capsule of novel membrane [104]. These early symptoms require the rehabilitation and replacement of these skin problems by using chitosan membrane which acts as a biodegradable template for the synthesis of neodermal tissues. Chitosan polymer also has structural features that are similar to glycosamine glycans which can be considered for the development of substratum for skin replacement [104]. Chitosan microcapsules have great significance for the chromatographic supports.

        <p>Studies demonstrate that novel fragrant biofibre and yarn were prepared by Schiff base using fragrant aldehydes such as n-decylaldehyde [108]. A small portion of aldehyde was slowly released from the fibre and yarn in open air and a little amount was released in the dry close vessels [109]. Essential oils were microencapsulated into chitosan for different purposes for example citronella essential oil is volatile and when encapsulated into chitosan can be used as mosquito repellent on textile surface [110]. Other essential oils as linseed oil, lemon and oil phase change materials were also encapsulated into chitosan for their applications in the textile industry [111]. Chitosan encapsulation was also use for fragrance finishing on fabrics as it reduced their evaporation rate and increases their staying duration. Chitosan encapsulated rose fragrance forming nanoparticles by ionic gelification was applied on cotton fabrics [112]. Alpha (α)-tocopherol is an excellent antioxidant but under oxidizing conditions it show less stability which limit its applications. Raza and co-workers [113] encapsulated the alpha (α)tocopherol in chitosan nanospheres which enhanced its stability in oxidative environment and prolonged its control release. Chitosan encapsulated α-tocopherol application on cotton fabric was investigated and it was observed that it causes little decrease in tensile strength while on the other hand increased its antibacterial efficiency.Studies demonstrate that novel fragrant biofibre and yarn were prepared by Schiff base using fragrant aldehydes such as n-decylaldehyde [108].

        <p>Microencapsulation is usually followed by the incorporation of active food ingredient such as enzymes, cells, or other materials in small capsules. Sensitive food components are protected in microcapsules offering better food processors against nutritional loss. Microencapsulation allows the control release of the active food ingredients at specific sites at the right time giving higher functional features. The effectiveness of food additives is typically increased by the released functional moiety which broadens the application of food ingredients. Microencapsulation turned reactive, sensitive, or volatile additives (vitamins, cultures, flavors, etc.) into a stable component of food [125]. Active ingredients incorporation into food and dairy products improves their nutritional worth. Calcium in orange juices, omega-3 fatty acids in eggs and guarana in sunflower seeds can be incorporated as active ingredient. Microencapsulation involves the formation of microcapsule containing shell material to entrap functional components as a core material with a few microns diameter capsule. Functional food components are uniformly coated with shell material to effectively separate the internal phase from surrounding material.

        <p>Wastewater generation and treatment is an important serious environmental issue particularly those generated by the textile, paper, leather and printing industries which contain significant heavy metal ions and dyes. To, date several techniques like biodegradation, coagulation, ion exchange, membrane filtration and adsorption have been used to eradicate water pollutants. In recent days chitosan-based composites have been used for wastewater treatment. Bagavathy and coworkers [137] encapsulated zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticle with Chitosan for dye adsorption from waste water. They investigated the adsorption of dye at different parameters and observed excellent removal efficiency. They also investigated the antibacterial efficiency of encapsulated material against Gram-positive and Gram negative bacterial and observed that chitosan effectively inhibited their proliferation. Global warming is a serious threat to the environment and extensive of petroleum in automobiles and industries making this issue wors [138]. Biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel can be a better alternative as they do not produce toxic gases like sulfer oxides upon burning. Immobilization of lipase by chitosan encapsulation for biodiesel production is gaining much attention because of the ecofriendly nature of biodiesel [139].Wastewater generation and treatment is an important serious environmental issue particularly those generated by the textile, paper, leather and printing industries which contain significant heavy metal ions and dyes.

        <p>Due to excellent biocompatibility nontoxicity, antibacterial and mucoadhesive properties chitosan polymer has attracted much interest and developed potential applications in various fields specially drug delivery, tissue engineering, biosensor, would healing, bioimaging, diagnostics, gene therapy, food technology and environmental technology as encapsulating material for active ingredients. Chitosan is a biological compactible and chemically (-OH and -NH2) versatile coating material. Owing to the superior properties of chitosan polymer over the other polysaccharides it not only increases the shelf life of encapsulated drugs by protecting them from harsh environment but also control their release rate. Chemically chitosan can be modified using different crosslinking agents as describes earlier which help in control release mechanism of the drug especially anticancer drug doxorubicin release. Most of the drugs fail at clinical phase due to their inability to reach the targeted sites and also due to their negative side effects.Due to excellent biocompatibility nontoxicity, antibacterial and mucoadhesive properties chitosan polymer has attracted much interest and developed potential applications in various fields specially drug delivery, tissue engineering, biosensor, would healing, bioimaging, diagnostics, gene therapy, food technology and environmental technology as encapsulating material for active ingredients.

        <p>Chitosan mucoadhesive property has provided a promising solution of this issue by targeting drug delivery system in which drugs are released only at the action sites. Chitosan has the ability to encapsulate several kinds of anticancer drugs such as PTX, curcumin, DOX, 6-Mercaptopurine, Vincristine, ADR, 5-FU among others, and deliver only them to the targeted tumour sites. Apart from these scientists in the recent time used chitosan for organ target drug delivery system which shows that chitosan has gained much importance in medical filed. The biomaterials used for tissue engineering requires specific properties such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, mucoadhesive, antibacterial and their degradation products must not be toxic, all of which are inherent for chitosan making it ideally suited as tissue engineering material. In addition, chitosan could be easily modified into scaffolds, hydrogels, nanofiber and dendrimer with additional properties as tissue engineering biomaterial. Chitosan scaffolds possess unique property to develop 3-dimentional environment for tissue engineering and use of different crosslinkers can help in degradation of shell material and drug release rate.Chitosan mucoadhesive property has provided a promising solution of this issue by targeting drug delivery system in which drugs are released only at the action sites.

        <p>Chitosan has proven itself and promising encapsulating material suitable for various therapeutic agents like antithrombotic, anticancer, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory, proteins, and amino acids while insuring their effective bioavailability at the target sites with an additional advantage of control release. This allowed chitosan to gain attention not only in the medical field but also for extensive applications in all fields of science. Chitosan is an antimicrobial and antioxidant due to presence of amino groups which act as scavenger of free hydroxyl radicals and high degree of deacetylation also increase antioxidant property of chitosan. due to its antimicrobial and antioxidant activity chitosan has also been used in encapsulation of various food material to protect them from sever external environments including low pH. Chitosan encapsulation also mask smell and undesirable flavour of active ingredient and enhance the shelf life of food material. The antimicrobial activity of chitosan has made it a useful polymeric material for introducing antimicrobial properties in fibres. Encapsulation of various nanoparticles and antibacterial ingredients in chitosan and its application on fibres impart certain versatile properties such as antibacterial, mosquito repellent, durability, colour stability and fragrance finishing on fabrics.Chitosan has proven itself and promising encapsulating material suitable for various therapeutic agents like antithrombotic, anticancer, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory, proteins, and amino acids while insuring their effective bioavailability at the target sites with an additional advantage of control release.

        <p>Encapsulation involves an art and a science where experience is important to develop the required capsules. Charge, size, molecular weight and deacetylation level of chitosan have great effects on microcapsule developments. Chitosan has been widely used due to its non-toxic, biodegradable and biocompatible characteristics and novel applications in drug delivery and tissue engineering. Microencapsulation using chitosan has been effectively applied in the agriculture, cosmetics, food and pharmaceutical industries for encapsulating alcohols, aqueous solutions, oils and various other bioactives. Existing stimulant factors such as pH, enzyme activity, temperature, osmotic force and mechanical stress may rapidly or controllably release of drug from chitosan. In this situation, the release of encapsulated drug may control other stimulant like food constituent, water activity and microbial load. Heat stable encapsulating polymer quality will be needed in future for food industry because there is great challenge of survival of probiotics during heat treatment. Process cost and size of microcapsule must also be considered in future research. High MW-310-375 kDa, &gt;75% degree of deacetylation, 800-2000 cPs.Encapsulation involves an art and a science where experience is important to develop the required capsules.
