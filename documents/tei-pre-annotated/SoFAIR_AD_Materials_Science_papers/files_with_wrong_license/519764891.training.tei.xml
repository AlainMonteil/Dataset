        <p>Pure magnesium (Mg) develops a strong basal texture after conventional processing of hot rolling or extrusion. Consequently, it exhibits anisotropic mechanical properties and is difficult to form at room temperature. Adding appropriate alloying elements can weaken the basal texture or even change it, but the improvement in formability and mechanical properties is still far from expectations. Over the past 20 years, considerable efforts have been made and significant progress has been made on wrought Mg alloys at the fundamental and technological levels. At the fundamental level, textures formed in sheets and extrusions of different alloy compositions and produced under different strain paths or thermomechanical processing conditions are relatively well established, with the assistance of the advanced characterisation technique of electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). At the technological level, room temperature formability of sheet has been significantly improved, and tension-compression yield asymmetry of extrusion is also remarkably reduced or eliminated. This paper starts with a review of dislocations, stacking faults and twins, and deformation of single crystals of pure Mg along different orientations and under different loading conditions, followed by a review of microstructure (texture and grain size) and deformation of polycrystalline pure Mg with different textures, grain sizes, and loading conditions. With these information as a base, texture, grain size and deformation of polycrystalline Mg-alloy sheets and extrusions produced under different processing conditions, are systematically examined and compared. Remaining and emerging scientific and technology issues are then highlighted and discussed in the context of texture and grain size. The need for better-resolution diffraction and spectroscopy techniques is also discussed in the relationship between texture change and grain boundary solute segregation.Pure magnesium (Mg) develops a strong basal texture after conventional processing of hot rolling or extrusion.

        <p>Comprising 2.7% of the earth's crust and being the third most plentiful element dissolved in seawater, magnesium (Mg) is an abundant element. It is readily commercially produced, with a purity exceeding 99.8%, from seawater, lake brines, dolomite, magnesite and other minerals. Its density is 66% of aluminium and 25% of steel. These unique features make Mg a promising material to substitute steel and aluminium alloys for more energy efficient and environmentally friendly applications. Statistic data indicates that each 100 kilogram reduction in vehicle weight reduces fuel consumption by 0.38 litre per 100 kilometre and CO2 emission by 8.7 gram per kilometre [1].Comprising 2.7% of the earth's crust and being the third most plentiful element dissolved in seawater, magnesium (Mg) is an abundant element.

        <p>Commercial production of magnesium metal was 277,000 tonnes per annum in 1999, but has risen rapidly to approximately 608,000 tonnes in 2009, and reached about 1,100,000 tonnes in 2019, Fig. 1. In 2017, a new magnesium production plant was constructed in Qinghai Province China, with an annual production rate of 100,000 tonnes from lake brines. One year later, Magontec's new magnesium alloy cast house facility started its operation, with an initial annual production rate of 60,000 tonnes of alloy ingots. For the primary magnesium metal produced each year, about 35% is used for making magnesium alloys in the form of castings and wrought products. The wrought magnesium products have been account for only about 1% of magnesium consumption, even though they reached 6% in 2017 in USA. The low figure of the wrought magnesium products is mainly due to low demands from the transportation and construction industries. However, a few significant developments have been made in recent years on the developments of wrought products. In 2014, Korean steel company POSCO and Renault Samsung Motors jointly developed a magnesium sheet that is to be used for the walls of VIP back seats and the trunks of upgraded SM7 vehicles. In 2015, Porsche selected Mg sheet for the roof of its new model of the 911 GT3 after its tests on Mg, Al, and carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers. In 2018, Nanjing Yunhai Special Metals Co. Ltd and Taiwan Jian Sin Industrial Co. Ltd announced a joint venture to invest one billion Yuan to build a new plant to produce one million forged magnesium wheels each year. With advances of processing and manufacturing technologies and alloy design, it is foreseeable that the global market for wrought magnesium products will expand significantly in the near future.Commercial production of magnesium metal was 277,000 tonnes per annum in 1999, but has risen rapidly to approximately 608,000 tonnes in 2009, and reached about 1,100,000 tonnes in 2019, Fig. 1.

        <p>Fig. 1Primary magnesium metal consumption each year in the period 1999-2019. One of the major barriers to the larger usage and wider application of wrought magnesium alloys is their limited formability at room temperature: bulk magnesium is intrinsically difficult to form at this temperature. Therefore, processes such as extrusion, rolling, and press forging must be carried out in the temperatures range 300-500°C. The productivity of magnesium alloy extrusions is much lower than that of aluminium alloys, and sheet production usually involves more stages of hot rolling. The processing cost is hence higher. Additionally, the extruded magnesium products often have tension-compression yield asymmetry: the compressive yield strength may be only half of the tensile yield strength, and rolled sheet usually has anisotropic formability and mechanical properties along different directions. Such problems have to be solved for any larger usage of wrought magnesium alloys.Fig. 1Primary magnesium metal consumption each year in the period 1999-2019.

        <p>Deformation modes that are commonly activated in Mg and its alloys include intra-granular slip and twinning and inter-granular grain boundary sliding, Fig. 2(a-c). Dynamic recrystallization may also occur to assist the plastic deformation, depending on the strain level and the applied temperature, Fig. 2(d). The available slip deformation modes are progressively more difficult to activate and this is compounded by a strong basal texture developed during thermomechanical processing. Twinning is highly dependent on orientation and exhausts after all suitably oriented grains have twinned, usually at around a strain of up to 0.08. As a result, in contrast to the substantial formability of aluminium, fracture usually occurs when polycrystalline pure magnesium is cold rolled by only 20-30% thickness reduction. The traditional approach to improve the room temperature formability of magnesium is to add appropriate alloying elements. Alloying additions can reduce the stress required to activate more deformation modes and/or weaken the texture to allow easier plastic deformation. While such approach has achieved some success in terms of formability improvement, it has not developed any magnesium products that are highly formable at room temperature. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive review of recent advances on wrought Mg alloys, covering (i) lattice defects and deformation modes, (ii) microstructures, (iii) mechanical properties and formability, and (iv) processing-microstructure-property relationships. The emphasize of the present review is focused on examination of two key microstructure factors: grain orientation (texture) and grain size in wrought Mg sheets and extrusions that are produced under different processing conditions, and how they influence the deformation and formability of the wrought products. The effects of alloying elements on texture and grain size and thus deformation and formability are also examined. This review ends with a discussion of microstructural design for better formability, and some scientific/technological challenges that require further research, and concluding remarks.Deformation modes that are commonly activated in Mg and its alloys include intra-granular slip and twinning and inter-granular grain boundary sliding, Fig. 2(a-c).

        <p>Magnesium has a hexagonal close-packed structure, with a c/a ratio of approximately 1.623 at 27°C. Its close-packed plane is (0001), and its close-packed directions are 〈112 � 0〉. The perfect dislocations are those with Burgers vectors in the basal plane (1/3&lt;112 � 0 &gt;, or 〈𝑎𝑎〉 type), or Burgers vectors perpendicular to the basal plane ([0001], or 〈𝑐𝑐〉 type) or Burgers vectors that are the sum of these two types (1/3〈112 � 3〉, or 〈𝑐𝑐 + 𝑎𝑎〉 type). The imperfect dislocations are those on the basal plane with a Shockley partial type Burgers vector (1/3〈101 � 0〉), or with a Burgers vector perpendicular to the basal plane (1/2[0001]), or the combination of these two types (1/6〈202 � 3〉).Magnesium has a hexagonal close-packed structure, with a c/a ratio of approximately 1.623 at 27°C.

        <p>There are four types of stacking faults in magnesium and its alloys, namely intrinsic faults I1 and I2, extrinsic fault E and twin-like fault T2. All of these faults have relatively low energy and do not affect the nearest-neighbor stacking sequence. The I1 fault is produced by removing the basal B (or A) plane above an A (or B) plane and shearing the remaining planes above the A (or B) plane by 1/3〈101 � 0〉. The I1 fault changes the stacking order of the close-packed planes from ABABABAB to ABABACAC, or ABABABAB to ABABCBCB. Traditionally, two different mechanisms have been proposed and accepted for the formation of I1 fault. One involves dissociation of a 〈𝑐𝑐 + 𝑎𝑎〉 perfect dislocation, Fig. 3(a1), while the other is vacancy condensation, Fig. 3(a2). In each case, there are two sessile Frank partial dislocations (b = 1/6〈022 � 3〉) bounding the two ends of the I1 fault.

        <p>Recent studies suggest that there are other mechanisms in generating the I1 fault. One mechanism involves nucleation or formation of twinning disconnections of a single layer height on fully coherent {101 � 1} or {101 � 2} twin boundaries [2,3], as illustrated in Figs. 3(a3) and 4. For this mechanism, one end of the I1 fault is an interfacial defect in the twin boundary, while the other end can be a Frank partial, if it terminates inside the twin, or bound by another interfacial defect in the other side of the twin boundary, if it terminates at the twin boundary. Interaction between basal 〈a〉 dislocation and {101 � 2} twin boundary [4] can also generate such I1 fault, but the essence of the interaction is identical to the geometry requirement outlined in Fig. 4. The interfacial defect located in the twin boundary is glissile and it can migrate with the twin boundary during twin thickening, resulting in substantial variation in length of the I1 fault. Such I1 fault is frequently observed inside {101 � 2} deformation twin. It is to be noted that such I1 fault is different from those from resulting from dissociation from 〈𝑐𝑐 + 𝑎𝑎〉 dislocation, and it cannot be used to experimentally measure the energy of I1 fault. Precaution has to be taken when imaging and analysing I1 fault experimentally in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), as Frank partial may react with basal 〈a〉 dislocation to form complex configurations such as an I1 fault bounded by Frank partial at one end and Shockley at the other end [5].

        <p>It has been recognised that solute atoms may segregate to I1 fault, but there are currently few experimental studies using Z-contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy. Most reports are based on first-principles density functional theory calculations. Fig. 5(a) shows the energy of I1 fault in pure Mg (~18 mJ•m 2 ) and the calculated quantitative effects of solute segregation on the fault energy. It is to be noted that many of these elements are not in commercial or laboratory alloys, as they are either practically difficult to add to molten magnesium or cause corrosion and other issues. It is to be further noted that all data are from binary solid solution alloys, the effects of solute segregation in ternary or quaternary alloy systems have not been studied even at the computational level. The validity of these data has not been quantitatively examined or verified by experiments. For most commonly used alloying elements, Al, Ca, Mn, Ca, Y and Nd, in wrought Mg alloys, their segregation in the stacking fault decreases fault energy, implying that their presence in magnesium may cause more stacking faults to form. This aspect is, however, not systematically experimentally evaluated, and more experimental study is needed in future. The segregation of Li or Zn does not seem to cause much variation of the fault energy.It has been recognised that solute atoms may segregate to I1 fault, but there are currently few experimental studies using Z-contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy.

        <p>The I2 fault can be generated by shearing the hexagonal lattice by 1/3〈101 � 0〉, or the passage of a Shockley partial dislocation on the basal plane, i.e. dissociating a perfect 〈𝑎𝑎〉 dislocation, Fig. 3(b1). The passage of the Shockley partial, or shearing, changes the stacking sequence of closely-packed planes from ABABABAB to ABABCACA, or BABABABA to BABACBCB. In contrast to the I1 fault that is bound by a pair of Frank partials, Fig. 3(a1), a single I2 fault bound by a pair of Shockley partial dislocations. The I1 fault can also be generated by two other mechanisms. One mechanism involves precipitation of a plate-shape particle having an ABCA stacking, Fig. 3(b2). The other involves formation of steps on twin boundaries, Fig. 3(b3). The energy of I2 fault is ~ 36 mJ•m 2 for pure Mg, but can be much smaller in solid solutions of some binary Mg alloys. While there are computed data of energies I2 faults in binary magnesium solid solutions, Fig. 5(b), there is again a lack of such data for ternary and quaternary magnesium solid solutions, and there is also a lack of experimental measurements that can be used to validate the computed data. It needs to be emphasized that an I2 fault with segregated solute can be characterized to be an I1 fault when analysis is made solely on g (0002) ⋅b ≠ 0, Fig. 3(c). In this situation, the contrast, i.e. g (0002) ⋅b ≠ 0, is caused by the segregated solute atoms, rather than the elastic strain associated with the fault. Precaution is needed in the characterization of stacking faults using conventional transmission electron microscopy. Fig. 5Computed energies of (a) I1 fault in pure Mg and with segregated solute atoms, and (b) I2 fault in pure Mg and with segregated solute atoms.

        <p>Stacking faults I2 and I1 have been frequently reported to form in magnesium alloys, even in alloys without any plastic deformation. Many of the so-called stacking faults are in fact thin precipitates lying on the basal plane of the Mg matrix, as illustrated in Fig. 3(b2). Long and thin precipitates often form on the basal plane of the Mg matrix phase, especially in Mg-Gd-Zn and Mg-Y-Zn based alloys [12,13]. The addition of even trace amount of Zn to a binary Mg-Y alloy can lead to the formation of such precipitates. The thin planar defects observed in Mg-Y-Zn alloys have long been accepted as I1 fault, based on g (0002) ⋅b ≠ 0 analysis. It is to be noted that the contrast, i.e. g (0002) ⋅b ≠ 0, is due to the presence of the precipitate, rather than the elastic strain of the Mg lattice surrounding the fault. Studies using Z-contrast atomic-resolution STEM indicate that the so-called I1 fault in the Mg-Y-Zn alloys are in fact γ' precipitate that has a hexagonal structure and an ABCA stacking sequence of the close-packed planes [14,15]. The γ' precipitate enriches in Y and/or Zn atoms in its B and C layers and is associated with a Shockley partial dislocation. Similar precipitates also form in aged Mg-Sn alloys [16].Stacking faults I2 and I1 have been frequently reported to form in magnesium alloys, even in alloys without any plastic deformation.

        <p>The extrinsic fault E is formed by inserting a C plane into the hexagonal stacking sequence, or the dissociation of a c perfect dislocation. The E fault is bounded by Frank partial dislocations (b = 1/2[0001]).

        <p>While the formation of an E fault can also generate an ABCA segment, the stacking order of the close-packed planes outside this segment is different from that associated with an I2 fault. The energy of the extrinsic fault is ~69 mJ•m 2 in pure Mg.While the formation of an E fault can also generate an ABCA segment, the stacking order of the close-packed planes outside this segment is different from that associated with an I2 fault.

        <p>The twin-like T2 fault can form from an I2 fault or in association with ordered segregation of solute atoms [17]. It is generated by displacing some atomic columns by 1/3〈011 � 0〉 in an A or B plane. The T2 fault changes the stacking sequence from ABABABAB to ABABCBABA, or to BABACABAB, and hence it leads to a twin-like arrangement of closely-packed planes with respect to the fault plane C. The energy of the T2 fault in pure M is in the range 41-43 mJ/m 2 , which is higher than those of I1 and I2 faults but lower than that of E fault. B. Slip, Twinning and Grain Boundary Sliding Basal slip is the dominant deformation mode in Mg. It can be activated at very low stress at room temperature. Non-basal slip, such as pyramidal I {101 � 1}〈112 � 3〉 and pyramidal II {112 � 2 � }〈112 � 3〉 slip and prismatic slip, also occur at room temperature, but at much higher stresses. For a given applied stress σ, the resolved shear stress along the slip or twinning direction on the slip or twin plane, τ, is given by τ = σ cos α cos β where α is the angle between the applied stress axis and the slip or twinning direction, and β is the angle between the applied stress axis and the slip or twinning plane normal. The orientation factor, cos α cos β , is also called Schmid factor, which is an important parameter in highly textured polycrystalline Mg and its alloys. τ value has to be larger than a critical value, critical resolved shear stress (CRSS), for the activation of slip or twinning. CRSS values of τ for basal, non-basal slip and twinning modes are provided is Fig. 6(a). Also included in this figure is the influence of temperature in CRSS values. Basal slip and extension twinning is less temperature dependent, but CRSS values of others deformation modes decrease significantly with increasing temperature. Additions of solutes, via alloying, can decrease or increase CRSS values, even at room temperature. As illustrated in Fig. 6(b), the addition of 1 wt.% Al to Mg can significantly increase the room temperature CRSS values for pyramidal and prismatic slip and {101 � 1}〈1 � 012〉 twinning.The twin-like T2 fault can form from an I2 fault or in association with ordered segregation of solute atoms [17]. It is generated by displacing some atomic columns by 1/3〈011 � 0〉 in an A or B plane. The T2 fault changes the stacking sequence from ABABABAB to ABABCBABA, or to BABACABAB, and hence it leads to a twin-like arrangement of closely-packed planes with respect to the fault plane C. The energy of the T2 fault in pure M is in the range 41-43 mJ/m 2 , which is higher than those of I1 and I2 faults but lower than that of E fault. B. Slip, Twinning and Grain Boundary Sliding Basal slip is the dominant deformation mode in Mg. It can be activated at very low stress at room temperature.

For a given applied stress σ, the resolved shear stress along the slip or twinning direction on the slip or twin plane, τ, is given by τ = σ cos α cos β where α is the angle between the applied stress axis and the slip or twinning direction, and β is the angle between the applied stress axis and the slip or twinning plane normal.

        <p>Despite that basal slip can be activated readily, it provides only two independent slip systems, which are insufficient to allow individual magnesium grains to plastically deform to meet the shape changes imposed by their neighbours. Therefore, non-basal slip on pyramidal or prismatic planes also occurs at room temperature in orientations that favour their occurrence, even though at much higher stresses. The Burgers vector of gliding dislocation for both pyramidal I slip and pyramidal II slip is 〈𝑐𝑐 + 𝑎𝑎〉 , and the easiness of activation of the 〈𝑐𝑐 + 𝑎𝑎〉 slip has been frequently used to explain deformation behaviour and effects of alloying elements in Mg and its alloys. It was recently reported that the poor formability or ductility of magnesium is due to pyramidal 〈𝑐𝑐 + 𝑎𝑎〉 dislocation transformations to an immobile structure [18][19][20]. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed that the easy-glide pyramidal 〈𝑐𝑐 + 𝑎𝑎〉 edge dislocations are unstable-they undergo a rapid transition to an immobile structure, comprising two Franck partial dislocations and a basal stacking fault between them, that limits c-axis plastic strain. A subsequent computational study reported [21] that adding appropriate alloying elements can lead to solute-enhanced cross-slip of 〈𝑐𝑐 + 𝑎𝑎〉 screw dislocations and thus improve ductility and formability. A large number of alloying elements, individually or in combination, was also proposed for achieving high ductility and high formability. It is to be noted that the proposed effect of the alloying elements is based exclusively on firstprinciples density functional theory (DFT) calculations and it has not been examined by any MD simulations due to the lack of inter-atomic potentials for magnesium alloys. A very recent work based on in-situ transmission electron microscope mechanical testing, 3D image reconstruction, and atomistic simulations [22] demonstrates that the 〈𝑐𝑐 + 𝑎𝑎〉 edge dislocation in pure Mg can glide on both pyramidal I {101 � 1} and pyramidal II {112 � 2 � } planes. A separate study of dislocations using weak-beam dark-field transmission electron microscopy reported that 〈𝑐𝑐 + 𝑎𝑎〉 dislocations do not dissociate in hot-rolled AZ31 alloy [23]. Other experimental observations made by atomic-resolution STEM indicates that 〈𝑐𝑐 + 𝑎𝑎〉 dislocation dissociate in Mg-Bi and Mg-Sn alloys [5,24]. Detailed and systematic characterization of more alloy systems and alloys produced under different deformation conditions is needed in future to resolve the controversial reports. Apart from basal and non-basal slip, twinning is also an important deformation mode. A variety of twin modes occur in Mg alloys, with twin planes on {101 � 1}, {101 � 2}, {101 � 3}, {101 � 4}, {101 � 5}, {303 � 4}, {112 � 1} and {112 � 4}. The most commonly observed twins are {101 � 2} extension twins, the formation and growth of which lead to an extension along the c-axis. The {101 � 1} twin forms under the stress condition that favours contraction along the c-axis. The critical resolved shear stress of the contraction twinning is much higher than that of the extension twinning, Fig. 6. Homogeneous initiation of either deformation twinning inside a magnesium grain is extremely difficult. Instead, the initiation starts in grain boundary or pre-existing twin boundary. Once nucleated, these twins can propagate readily and rapidly in the grain, often extending from one side of the grain to the other side.Despite that basal slip can be activated readily, it provides only two independent slip systems, which are insufficient to allow individual magnesium grains to plastically deform to meet the shape changes imposed by their neighbours.

        <p>It is now well known that solute segregation occurs in fully coherent twin boundaries. In general, solutes with larger than atomic size than Mg segregate to extension sites in the twin boundary, while solutes having smaller atomic size than Mg goes to contraction site. This solute segregation leads to reduction of twin boundary energy. The tendency for segregation in binary alloys containing different types of solutes is illustrated in Fig. 7. Most commonly used alloying elements in wrought Mg alloys have a strong tendency for segregation in twin boundaries. It is to be noted that all data are for binary alloys, the segregation behavior in ternary or quaternary alloys has not been extensively studied. For ternary alloys based on Mg-Gd-Zn and Mg-Nd-Ag systems, in which both larger and smaller solutes are present, different segregation behaviors are found in recent studies using both atomic-resolution STEM and first-principles DFT calculation [25,3]. In the Mg-Gd-Zn alloy, both Gd and Zn atoms segregate into extension sites, but in the Mg-Nd-Ag alloy Nd and Zn atoms segregate separately into extension and contraction sites. The solute segregation generates a strong pinning effect on twin boundary migration and annealing strengthening phenomenon. Such effects influence strongly twinning behaviour during plastic deformation and thermomechanical processes.It is now well known that solute segregation occurs in fully coherent twin boundaries.

        <p>Apart from intra-granular deformation modes of slip and twinning, there exists inter-granular deformation modes such as grain boundary sliding. Grain boundary sliding becomes important when the grain size approaches 1 µm or less in polycrystalline Mg and its alloys. In contrast to studies made on slip and twinning, there are few studies made so far on grain boundary sliding in Mg alloys. This is mainly because the grain size in wrought Mg alloys produced by conventional processes is typically above 5 µm.Apart from intra-granular deformation modes of slip and twinning, there exists inter-granular deformation modes such as grain boundary sliding.

        <p>The room temperature response of single crystals of pure Mg under plane-strain compression at a strain rate of 10 -3 s -1 is shown in Fig. 8, for different orientations of the crystals with respect to the loading direction [30,31]. For crystals with c-axis parallel to the loading direction, orientations A and B in Fig. 8(a), they exhibit quite limited plastic strain (~0.04) before fracture. This low formability is attributable to the lack of deformation modes. The operating deformation mode under this forming condition has been unclear, even though it was reported to be {101 � 1}〈1 � 012〉 contraction twinning, and subsequent occurrence of secondary twinning on {101 � 2} and basal slip inside the double-twinned region, in the early studies made by Wonsiewicz and Backofen [32] and by Kelley and Hosford [30]. The initiation of twinning on {101 � 1} was observed only at strain levels close to fracture. While only basal slip traces were observed up to a strain level of 0.04, these traces were attributed to the operation of basal slip which resulting from misalignment of the c-axis of the tested pure Mg crystal with the loading axis.The room temperature response of single crystals of pure Mg under plane-strain compression at a strain rate of 10 -3 s -1 is shown in Fig. 8, for different orientations of the crystals with respect to the loading direction [30,31].

        <p>Under plane-strain compression at the same strain rate, pure Mg single crystal exhibits larger plastic strain when its c-axis is perpendicular to the loading axis, Figs. 8(b) and 8(c). The larger strain is associated with the formation of profuse twins. Under the condition that plane-strain compression perpendicular to the constrained c-axis, orientations C and D in Fig. 8(b), single crystal of pure Mg may also exhibit larger plastic strain before failure. While such orientations are favourable for prismatic slip and pyramidal I slip, slip traces of such deformation systems were not found in optical micrographs [30]. Instead, plastic deformation occurs by simultaneous operation of {101 � 1}〈1 � 012〉 twinning, {101 � 2}〈1 � 011〉 twinning, and dynamic recrystallization within bands of {101 � 1} twins. It was suggested [33] that the dynamic recrystallization occurs subsequently, after the formation and widening of {101 � 1} twins, to accommodate further plastic strain.

        <p>When the loading axis is parallel to the 〈101 � 0〉 direction and the deformation along the c-axis is constrained, i.e. orientation E in Fig. 8(c), deformation proceeds until the single crystal becomes fully {101 � 2} twinned at approximately 0.064 strain, followed by the operation of {101 � 1}〈1 � 012〉 twinning, inside the reoriented crystal, until fracture. Pure Mg can be deformed to a much larger plastic strain if the loading axis is parallel to the 〈12 � 10〉 direction and the deformation along the c-axis is constrained, orientation F in Fig. 8(c).

        <p>Single crystal of pure Mg can be deformed readily at significantly lower stress, and to much larger plastic strain, when its orientation is such to favour basal slip. One example is the orientation G in Fig. 8(c), in which the c-axis of the crystal is initially inclined at 45° to the compression direction and the deformation along the 〈101 � 0〉 direction is constrained. As illustrated in Figs. 8(c) and 9, the single crystal with orientation G exhibits substantial plasticity, can be deformed to 0.6 strain [34], and even up to 1.0 strain [33], without fracturing. The plastic deformation is accompanied by a significantly larger strain hardening rate for the strain range 0.6-1.0. Deformation is not uniform across the crystal with an increase in plastic strain. The crystal deforms initially by basal slip, leading to gradual rotation of the c-axis towards the compression direction. The continued deformation leads to the formation of macroscopic bands comprising {101 � 2} twins, with two variants forming a tweed structure that is parallel to the constraint direction 〈101 � 0〉 . The volume fraction of such bands increases with an increase in strain. The formation of the {101 � 2} twin is anomalous, because it has a negative Schmid factor and generates a strain opposite to the imposed deformation. However, the chevron arrangement of the two twin-variants leads to no macroscopic twin shear along the constraint direction 〈101 � 0〉. The formation of the {101 � 2} twin make the c-axis of the initial matrix farther away from the compression direction, which compensates the lattice rotation caused by basal slip.

        <p>The deformation behaviours of single crystals of pure Mg under these loading and constrain conditions have been confirmed in later studies [33][34][35][36]. Figure 9 shows the stress-strain curves of orientations D, E, F and G, which are similar to those shown in Fig. 8 but contain more data especially for the orientations exhibiting substantially larger plasticity. While orientations E and F both allow for c-axis extension, they exhibit a drastic difference in plasticity. The crystal of orientation E starts to yield at a very low stress, followed by rapid strain hardening, and it fractures at a stress of ~400 MPa and a plastic strain of 0.15. The crystal of orientation F exhibits an initial strain hardening and the onset of plastic deformation at a lower stress, followed by a rapid increase in hardening rate and yielding and yield drop at approximately 220 MPa. Further loading leads to continuous plastic deformation at a lower but constant strain hardening rate, but there is no fracture or failure for strain up to 0.6 and even 1.0 [33,34].The deformation behaviours of single crystals of pure Mg under these loading and constrain conditions have been confirmed in later studies [33][34][35][36].

        <p>Figures 9(b) and 9(c) show EBSD maps of crystal orientations E and F subjected to 0.03 compressive strain, respectively. An extensive amount of {101 � 2} twins is observed in both specimens. While the area fraction of twins (~ 53%) in each specimen is approximately the same, the morphology of the twins and the number of crystallographic variants of the twins are clearly different. Only one twin variant (marked by red color) forms in orientation E, but two twin variants (marked by orange color) are activated in the case of orientation F. Furthermore, an appreciable fraction of secondary {101 � 2} twins is also activated inside the primary {101 � 2} twins in orientation F, indicated by STW in the map in Fig. 9(b), in contrast to the absence of secondary twinning in the specimen of orientation E. It is important to emphasize that the orientations of the twin variants, with respect to the loading and constrain directions, are drastically different in the two cases. For orientation E, the orientation of the formed {101 � 2} twins is such that it makes secondary twinning harder to occur (i.e. a harder orientation for twinning). However, for orientation F, it is possible for {101 � 2} twins to form and grow continuously inside the parent crystal until the bulk of the parent crystal is consumed, at a strain of approximately 0.08 [36.]. While secondary and tertiary {101 � 2} twins also form inside the primary {101 � 2} twins, their number density and volume fraction are both quite low in samples deformed by up to 0.08 strain. Snapshot based examination of the deformed microstructures indicates that the formation of "fragmented twin bands" at 0.11 strain, at which the yield drop occurs, Fig. 9(a). These fragmented twin bands were reported to result from {101 � 1} twins that have formed inside primary twins [36], even though the formation of the {101 � 1} twins was not directly shown in that work. In fact, such fragmented twin bands resemble the feature of dynamic recrystallization within deformation bands. With continued plastic deformation, the volume fraction of the dynamic recrystallized grains increases in the bulk sample and these dynamic recrystallized grains have a strikingly weak basal texture, Fig. 9(d). The substantial plasticity of pure Mg in this orientation is likely attributable to repeated dynamic recrystallization during the continued plastic deformation. While it has been proposed [36] that the dynamic recrystallized grains evolve from the formation of sub-grain boundaries and their progressive rotation to high-angle boundaries, a more thorough characterization at multiple scales is needed in order to establish the dynamic recrystallization mechanisms operating under this particular deformation conditions.Figures 9(b) and 9(c) show EBSD maps of crystal orientations E and F subjected to 0.03 compressive strain, respectively.

        <p>When single crystal of pure Mg is deformed under a uniaxial compression condition along its caxis, the dominant deformation mode is generally accepted to be pyramidal slip with 〈𝑐𝑐 + 𝑎𝑎〉 dislocations, even though it is not fully established whether it is {101 � 1}〈112 � 3〉 pyramidal I slip, {112 � 2}〈112 � 3〉 pyramidal II slip, or both. Other slip systems such as basal slip and prismatic slip, and {101 � 2}〈1 � 011〉 extension twinning and {101 � 1}〈1 � 012〉 contraction twinning modes, are absent or scarce. The early studies made by slip trace observations and transmission electron microscopy of pure Mg deformed at a strain rate of 1.7 × 10 -4 s -1 [37,38] reported {112 � 2}〈112 � 3〉 pyramidal II slip as the major deformation mode, and these studies have been confirmed in a recent work made by detailed characterization of dislocations in the microstructure of deformed single crystals [39]. However, a more recent observation made by slip trace analysis of pure Mg deformed by 3% under similar conditions [40] revealed that the dominant deformation mode is {101 � 1}〈112 � 3〉 pyramidal I slip, instead of pyramidal II slip. The critical resolved shear stress was measured to be 54 MPa.

Other slip systems such as basal slip and prismatic slip, and {101 � 2}〈1 � 011〉 extension twinning and {101 � 1}〈1 � 012〉 contraction twinning modes, are absent or scarce. The early studies made by slip trace observations and transmission electron microscopy of pure Mg deformed at a strain rate of 1.7 × 10 -4 s -1 [37,38] reported {112 � 2}〈112 � 3〉 pyramidal II slip as the major deformation mode, and these studies have been confirmed in a recent work made by detailed characterization of dislocations in the microstructure of deformed single crystals [39]. However, a more recent observation made by slip trace analysis of pure Mg deformed by 3% under similar conditions [40] revealed that the dominant deformation mode is {101 � 1}〈112 � 3〉 pyramidal I slip, instead of pyramidal II slip. The critical resolved shear stress was measured to be 54 MPa.

        <p>For uniaxial compression along a direction that is close to but not parallel to the a-axis, in which the basal plane is slightly off the compression axis, the plastic deformation occurs at very low stress via basal slip, followed by non-basal slip and {101 � 2}〈1 � 011〉 twinning. The presence of basal 〈𝑎𝑎〉 dislocations, prismatic 〈𝑎𝑎〉 dislocations, pyramidal I and II 〈𝑐𝑐 + 𝑎𝑎〉 dislocations are all observed in sample deformed at a low stress, in the range 8-10 MPa. It was suggested [41] that the operation of all of these slip systems is necessary to accomplish the shape change of the crystal during compression. While the external stress applied to the single crystal of Mg is far below the CRSS value required to activate non-basal slip, the non-basal slip occurs to reduce or eliminate the stress caused by the pileup of basal dislocations.For uniaxial compression along a direction that is close to but not parallel to the a-axis, in which the basal plane is slightly off the compression axis, the plastic deformation occurs at very low stress via basal slip, followed by non-basal slip and {101 � 2}〈1 � 011〉 twinning.

        <p>The stress-strain curves for single crystals of pure Mg under uniaxial compression at a strain rate of 10 -4 s -1 at room temperature are shown in Fig. 10, for different orientations of the crystals with respect to the loading direction [42]. The orientations of these single crystals vary from [0001] to [101 � 0], with 10° rotation about the [12 � 10] direction. Significant difference is observed, indicating the variation of deformation modes when the c-axis of Mg crystal is tilted from [0001] to [101 � 0] with respect to the loading axis. Mg crystal deforms at a much lower stress, and the strain hardening rate at the initial stage of plastic deformation drops drastically, when the compression axis is 10° away from the c-axis. The flow stress and strain hardening rate both decrease further when the compression axis is further away from the c-axis, by 20°. There is little change in flow stress and strain hardening rate when the crystal orientation is in the range 20-70°. Under the condition of uniaxial compression along the [101 � 0] direction, the flow stress and strain hardening rate are both small at low strains, but they increase significantly until fracture occurs at about 0. b. Tension The stress-strain curves of single crystals of pure Mg under uniaxial tension at room temperature at a strain rate of 10 -4 s -1 along crystallographic directions, [0001], [101 � 0] and [90 123 ����� 33 0], are shown in Fig. 11(a) [43]. In case of pure Mg single crystal pulled along the [0001] direction, massive {101 � 2} twins are observed during the initial stage of deformation. The yield stress is only ~ 6.6 MPa and the fracture strain is over 30% in this orientation. The {101 � 2} twins are readily formed from the initial stage of the deformation at low stress with a small strain hardening rate. The flow stress subsequently increases after ~ 10% strain. The basal slip is suppressed for the initial orientation. However, it can be activated inside of the {101 � 2} twins. Therefore, the strength of the pure Mg single crystal along this orientation is effectively strengthened by the activation of basal slip. When the loading direction is parallel to [101 � 0], pure Mg single crystal is expected to be deformed under multiple slip condition, activating prismatic slip and pyramidal 〈𝑐𝑐 + 𝑎𝑎〉 slip. The yield stress of this orientation is ~ 109 MPa, whereas the fracture strain is limited to ~ 1.4%. The relatively higher strain hardening rate can be explained by the interaction between different deformation modes. The tensile test along the [90 123 ����� 33 0] direction is also carried out to activate the prismatic slip mode. In this orientation, the Schmid factor for the prismatic slip is 0.5. The tensile yield stress for this orientation is found to be ~ 96 MPa and the fracture strain is ~10%. The strain hardening rate for this orientation is smaller than that of the [101 � 0] loading direction, since the specimen is deformed under a single deformation condition. The pure Mg single crystal with this tensile orientation is deformed only by the prismatic slip, which is confirmed by dislocation observation via transmission electron microscopy. The calculated CRSS for the prismatic slip is in good agreement with those reported earlier [44,45].The stress-strain curves for single crystals of pure Mg under uniaxial compression at a strain rate of 10 -4 s -1 at room temperature are shown in Fig. 10, for different orientations of the crystals with respect to the loading direction [42].

        <p>For single crystals deformed with the loading axis parallel to the basal plane and along with [10 1 � 0], optical microscopy observation indicates that plastic deformation occurs primarily by prismatic slip [46]. A more recent study [43,47] reveals that the prismatic slip is activated in the early stage of plastic deformation and it is followed by basal slip.

Spherical indentation Anisotropic deformation of single crystal of pure Mg made by spherical indenter has been studied by Kitahara and co-workers [49]. The indentation was made on (0001), (11 � 00) and (112 � 0) planes. Indentation on the (0001) surface leads to isotropic deformation within the basal plane, giving rise to a circular morphology on the basal planes, Fig. 12. The operative slip activities during the (0001) indentation are also illustrated in Fig. 12. The basal slip and pyramidal slip occurs simultaneously to allow the plastic deformation to continue symmetrically along directions lying within and outside the basal plane in the region beneath the indentation. Indentation on the (11 � 00) and (112 � 0) surfaces produces indent shapes that are quite different from that associated with (0001) indentation. In these two cases, the indent shape is elliptic, resulting from anisotropic activation of basal slip and twinning. A large fraction of {101 � 2} twins is generated in regions around and beneath the indent. Such twins are mostly elongated along the [112 � 0] direction for the (11 � 00) indentation, and are inclined 25° from (0001) for the (112 � 0) indentation. The slip bands extend along the [0001] direction over a distance that is much larger than the size of the major axis of the elliptic indent.

        <p>Stretch formability of single crystal sheet of pure Mg along different directions has been evaluated by Erichsen cupping test at room temperature [50]. The sheet of 1 mm thickness and of selected orientation is cut from bulk single crystals, and the Erichsen test is performed with a punch speed of 0.0833 mm s -1 and a punch diameter of 20 mm. The depth of the punching at which fracture occurs, generally known as the Erichsen Index, has been used to evaluate sheet formability. Table I shows the Erichsen test results at room temperature for five representative crystallographic orientations. The sheet surface is parallel to (777 0 777 ����� 829), (101 � 0), (12 � 10), (897 449 ����� 449 ����� 829) and (0001) plane, respectively. The angle between the loading direction and the c-axis is 45° for the orientations A and D, and 90° for the orientations B and D, respectively. The loading direction is parallel to the c-axis for the orientation E. Plastic anisotropy in Mg single crystal induces an anisotropically deformed dome shape along a certain direction during the Erichsen test. The single crystal study reveals the change of IE values with orientations, which can be attributed to the nonuniform distribution of strain components due to anisotropic nature and heterogeneous twinning evolution throughout the deformed single crystal. The stress states differ from the centre to the edge and through the sheet thickness, i.e. they differ across the entire dome of the deformed sheet. In such situation, the deformation behavior of the single crystal sheet is quite different from the plane-strain compression and uniaxial compression or indentation that are mentioned before. Therefore, it is difficult to describe deformation modes, or to use Schmid factor, to explain deformation behavior and stretch formability. Figure 13 shows the values of basal slip activation for the five subdivided regions in two cross sections: the Y-Z and X-Z sections of the orientation B and the orientation C specimens. The results show that the values for basal slip activation of the orientation B are higher than those for the orientation C throughout the deformed specimen. Interestingly, the orientation C exhibits an IE of 2.0 mm, even though a considerable number of tensile twins are observed. Figure 14 shows the results of twin analysis for the five subdivided regions in the X-Z section of three orientation conditions. A large amount of tensile twins is observed in the B and C orientations due to the geometry of their initial crystallographic orientations, whereas less twins are observed in the A orientation. The relative activities of tensile twins in the orientations B and C along the X direction are found to be higher than that in the orientation A. However, the results exhibit that the tensile twins in orientation B, especially those nucleated from the bottom surface of the deformed specimen inducing the activation of additional basal slip towards the newly oriented direction, are favorable for improving room temperature stretch formability, while those in orientation C are not. Therefore, orientation B can be defined as the twinning-induced soft orientation, while orientation C can be defined as twinninginduced hard orientation. Table I.

        <p>The major deformation modes occurring at elevated temperatures differ from those at room temperature because CRSS values for prismatic and pyramidal slip and {101 � 1}〈1 � 012〉 and {101 � 3}〈3 � 032〉 twinning decrease with an increase in temperature, Fig. 6. Among the deformation modes, only basal slip and {101 � 2}〈1 � 011〉 twinning are temperature independent. At temperatures above 300°C, the CRSS values for various slip and twinning modes are similar, implying that such deformation modes can be activated simultaneously which in turn implies that plastic deformation occurs at lower stress and that larger plasticity can be obtained.The major deformation modes occurring at elevated temperatures differ from those at room temperature because CRSS values for prismatic and pyramidal slip and {101 � 1}〈1 � 012〉 and {101 � 3}〈3 � 032〉 twinning decrease with an increase in temperature, Fig. 6.

        <p>The stress-strain curves of single crystals of pure Mg under plane-strain compression is shown in Fig. 15, for some different orientations of the crystals with respect to the loading direction [32]. In general, plastic deformation occurs at lower stress and plasticity is increased. The lower strain in each curve at elevated temperature is due to the artificial termination of the test for metallography observations. Fig. 16(a) shows the stress-strain curve of single crystal of pure Mg deformed along a direction lying at 45° with the c-axis of the crystal and with constrained deformation along &lt;101 � 0&gt; [35]. The deformation behaviour at 200° and 370°C is similar to that at room temperature when the plasticity strain is less than 0.4. While strain hardening rate at elevated temperatures gradually increases with plastic strain, the stresses level required to produce 1.0 compression strain are significantly lower than that for room temperature. Examination of microstructures of specimens deformed to 1.0 strain at 200°C and 370°C indicates that the amount of deformation twinning in these specimens is remarkably lower than the counterpart at room temperature and that these specimens remain predominantly single crystalline; recrystallization is not observed.

        <p>Fig. 16(b) shows stress-strain curves of single crystals of pure Mg deformed at 200°C and 370°C along crystal's c-axis and with &lt;101 � 0&gt; constraint [51]. Data at strain larger than 0.5 are not included. These two curves are similar, except that the one obtained at 370°C has a lower yield stress. In each case, the stress increases rapidly to a maximum, then drops sharply to about half of the maximum stress that keeps plastic deformation continue at a steady strain rate. The onset of the steady-state flow at 370°C occurs at a strain lower than that at 200°C. Examination of the microstructure of the specimen deformed at 200°C to 1.0 strain indicates the presence of a large volume fraction of {101 � 1} and {101 � 3} contraction twins and secondary {101 � 2} twins inside the primary twins of {101 � 1} and {101 � 3}. The {101 � 1} twin is more prevalent than {101 � 3} twin. The formation of these contraction twins changes the orientation of the basal plane to lie at angles that promote basal slip. In addition to the basal slip, the formation of secondary {101 � 2} twins also provide an accommodation to the plastic strain. Additionally, some {101 � 1} twins have transformed into elongated bands comprising dynamically recrystallized grains. The microstructure of the specimen deformed by 1.0 strain at 370°C contains much less {101 � 1} twins. The {101 � 1} twins formed at early stage of deformation have fully transformed to bands of recrystallized grains. Analysis of the orientations of the recrystallized grains within a twin band indicate the existence of a unique texture-the c-axes of all newly formed recrystallized grains are almost parallel to each other and parallel to the c-axis of their parent {101 � 1} twin. This observation implies that the boundaries between recrystallized grains are effectively tilt boundaries. The unique arrangement of the orientation of the recrystallized grains was taken as the evidence for the occurrence of continuous recovery and continuous dynamic recrystallization. constraint [32].

        <p>While the phenomenon of rapid hardening followed by rapid softening, i.e. the occurrence of a sharp yield drop shown in Fig. 16(b), at the early stage of deformation has been attributed to the lack of easily activated slip and twinning modes (responsible for rapid hardening) and onset of dynamic recrystallization (responsible for rapid softening), it remains to be answered whether the onset of recrystallization within some twins can give rise to the phenomenon of strong and rapid softening. It also remains unclear why the stress-strain curve becomes a plateau at later stage of deformation.While the phenomenon of rapid hardening followed by rapid softening, i.e. the occurrence of a sharp yield drop shown in Fig. 16(b), at the early stage of deformation has been attributed to the lack of easily activated slip and twinning modes (responsible for rapid hardening) and onset of dynamic recrystallization (responsible for rapid softening), it remains to be answered whether the onset of recrystallization within some twins can give rise to the phenomenon of strong and rapid softening.

        <p>Figure 17 shows deformation behavior of single crystals of pure Mg under uniaxial compression at an initial strain rate of 10 -3 s -1 at temperatures ranging from 20°C to 400°C [52]. Such deformation behaviour was confirmed later on by Obera, Yoshinga and Morozumi [53] in tests under similar conditions. The flow stress decreases with increasing temperature. The strain hardening rate is high in the initial stage of deformation, but decreases rapidly when temperature is above 200°C. Based on optical microscopy of deformed specimens, Yoshinaga and Horiuchi [52] suggested that twinning leads to rapid hardening and fracture at much lower strain when the temperature is below 200°C. They also proposed that the flow stress decreases with an increase in twinning, and an unlimited plasticity is obtainable when the temperature is above 200°C. A subsequent study made by transmission electron microscopy [53] suggested that, in addition to twinning, pyramidal II slip operates at all temperatures, ranging from 20°C to 600°C. It was further proposed in this study that the work hardening rate of the pyramidal II slip system is very high at temperatures below 200°C. The gliding dislocations in this slip system were found to be 〈𝑐𝑐 + 𝑎𝑎〉 and they reportedly have a strong preference to lie along the basal plane. Small dislocation loops lying on the basal plane are also found. The edge dislocation is much less mobile than the screw dislocation. The number density of long dislocations and small dislocation loops is high in specimen deformed at room temperature, but decreases with increasing temperature. The small dislocation loops are rarely observed in specimens deformed at 200°C and above. It becomes difficult to detect the presence of long dislocations in specimens deformed at a temperature above 250°C, even if the specimen is quenched immediately after the deformation, implying that the dislocations can be annealed out rapidly at such temperature. While not explained in detail, the possibility of dissociation of the 〈𝑐𝑐 + 𝑎𝑎〉 dislocation on the basal plane to two sessile partial dislocations, or 〈𝑐𝑐〉 and 〈𝑎𝑎〉 full dislocations, was speculated.Figure 17 shows deformation behavior of single crystals of pure Mg under uniaxial compression at an initial strain rate of 10 -3 s -1 at temperatures ranging from 20°C to 400°C [52].

        <p>b. Tension The stress-strain curves of single crystal pure Mg deformed at elevated temperatures, in the range between room temperature and 460°C, by uniaxial tension at a strain rate of 10 -4 s - 1. Microstructure of sheets a. Plate and sheet from uni-directional rolling The microstructure of a cold rolled Mg sheet is shown in Fig. 19(a). The sheet is fully recrystallized with a strong basal texture and an averaged grain size of about 42 µm before it is cold rolled by 30% thickness reduction which is the limit for cold rolling without cracking. The microstructure contains shear band and {101 � 2} twin, together with a few {101 � 1} -{101 � 2} double twin. The contrast variation within each band resembles the feature of recrystallized grains. The presence of such microstrcutral features indicates localized distrbution of plastic strain in the deformed specimen. The proportions of shear band and {101 � 2} twin changes with cold strain: the fraction of shear band increases, while that of {101 � 2} twin decreases, with increasing strain. While the {101 � 2} twin was suggested to have formed during unloading, instead of during the rolling deformation, it remains to be confirmed whether the twin is {101 � 2} twin and if so whether the formation of such twin is truly not related to the cold rolling process. As will be discussed in Section IV, {101 � 2} twin is not observed in cold-rolled thin plate of AZ31. Given the spread of c-axes of the grains in the sheet with respect to the sheet normal direction, it is worth carrying out quasi-in-situ EBSD experiment in the future, especially on those grains whose c-axes are deviated from the sheet normal direction before cold rolling.b.

        <p>The cold rolling leads a narrower spread of the c-axes of the grains and thus a stronger basal texture, as shown in Fig. 19(b). However, the c-axes tend to split along the rolling direction. While not indicated directly in the figure, the original grains have already rotated their &lt;101 � 0&gt; directions towards the rolling direction. Upon subsequent annealing at an appropriate temperature, the deformed microstructure will recrystallize, and grain orientation will change. The strong basal texture in the asrolled sheet will be weakened to a certain level, and the 〈112 � 0〉 directions of most grains will be aligned along the rolling direction. When the initial grain size is reduced to the proximity of 1 µm, cold rolling of a basal-textured sheet of pure Mg does not cause any apparent shear bands and twins to form inside individual grains. Fig. 20(a) shows EBSD maps of a sheet that is rolled at room temperature from an extruded pure Mg plate by 50% in thickness reduction. Despite possessing a strong basal texture, this sheet can be further cold rolled to down to many thime thinner, and the final sheet produced by the heavy cold rolling can be further formed substantially without cracking, Fig. 20(b). The dominant deformation modes were speculated to change from those intra-granular (slip and twinning) to inter-granular modes such as grain boundary sliding when the grain size reduces to the vicinity a micron. Under such circumstance, the factors that affect intra-granular deformation become less significant. Consequently, strain inside individual grains is unlikely to build to a level that will cause fracture.The cold rolling leads a narrower spread of the c-axes of the grains and thus a stronger basal texture, as shown in Fig. 19(b).

        <p>For hot-rolled Mg sheet, its grain size is influenced strongly by the hot rolling temperature, even though its texture changes less significantly. In general, the size of recrystallized grains increases with increasing temperature, and the microstructure changes from a mixture of deformed grains and recrystallized small grains at lower temperatures to fully recrystallized grains of larger size at highwe temperatures. Associated with the microstructure change from partial to full recrystallization, the texture evolves gradually from b. Plate and sheet from cross rolling Since the texture of magnesium is strongly influenced by rolling conditions such as temperature, rolling speed, and thickness reduction per single pass, effects of unidirectional rolling, reverse rolling and cross rolling on texture have been studied. There is little difference between the textures resulting from multi-pass reverse rolling and multi-pass unidirectional rolling. The basal pole is shifted by about 8-18° from the ND towards the RD, depending on the rolling temperature, as indicated by the (0001) pole figure shown in Fig. 22. The multi-pass cross rolling also leads to basal texture, but weaker intensity. In this case, the basal poles are more symmetrical: they shift towards the TD (RD1) after the final cross rolling along the RD2. [57]. c. Plate and sheet from asymmetric rolling Asymmetric rolling of pure magnesium in the temperature range 25-350°C does not seem to change the basal texture that is usually associated with plate or sheet produced by symmetric rolling. Figure 23 compares microstructure and texture produced by asymmetric (ARS) and symmetrical rolling (SR). Plates of 10 mm thickness cut from a hot forged plate of 40 mm thickness and were used for rolling. This plate reportedly has a fairly weak basal texture and an average grain size of 14 µm. The plate thickness is reduced to 2.5 mm by two passes, with 50% thickness reduction in each pass. In the case of asymmetric rolling, the upper larger roll and the smaller lower roller have a circumferential speed of 0.92 m⋅s -1 and 0.61 m⋅s -1 , respectively. The average of these two speeds is used for symmetric rolling. The difference in the surface speed of the upper and lower rollers cause an additional shear deformation throughout the thickness of the sheet during the asymmetric rolling, as indicated by the inclination of an initially vertical insert shown in Fig. 23. Under the condition of similar deformation temperature and thickness reduction, the microstructures of ARS and SR specimens are quite similar. There is little difference between the average grain size, even though the grain size distribution in the ASR specimen is slightly wider than that in the SR sample. It is perhaps worth mentioning that the Mg plate is rolled by 75% thickness reduction at room temperature in both ASR and SR processes, which is substantially larger than what is possible (20-30%) for basal-textured plate of pure Mg. It is unclear whether this remarkably higher rollability is due to the initial good quality of the plate (resulting from forging) and/or the much higher rolling speed used in the rolling process. The average circumferential speed is about 0.75 m⋅s -1 , or 45 m⋅min - 1 , which is 5-10 times higher than those commonly used in most laboratories and the industry. As will be discussed in Section IV, the rollability of late/sheet of Mg alloys is remarkably enhanced when higher rolling speed is used.For hot-rolled Mg sheet, its grain size is influenced strongly by the hot rolling temperature, even though its texture changes less significantly.

        <p>Inspection of the microstructures of specimens cold-rolled by 75% reveals the mixed presence of smaller equiaxed recrystallized grains and larger elongated grains. The average grain size is about 2 µm in each case. The texture of the cold-rolled specimens is similar to those rolled at higher temperatures: the c-axes of the grains are nearly parallel to the plate normal direction. While the basal fibre is rotated by 5-10° anticlockwise from the ND in the case of the ASR, such variation in texture is unlikely to cause any change in plate formability.Inspection of the microstructures of specimens cold-rolled by 75% reveals the mixed presence of smaller equiaxed recrystallized grains and larger elongated grains.

        <p>Apart from the puzzle on the substantial rollability of the plate at room temperature, the presence of a considerably larger volume fraction of recrystallized grains is equally puzzling, as it is rare to see dynamic recrystallization occurring massively during cold rolling at room temperature of coarsegrained plate or sheet. It remains unclear whether the massive formation of recrystallized grains is due to the much larger strain imposed in each pass (50% reduction in a single pass). The reproducibility of this work needs to be further examined in the future.Apart from the puzzle on the substantial rollability of the plate at room temperature, the presence of a considerably larger volume fraction of recrystallized grains is equally puzzling, as it is rare to see dynamic recrystallization occurring massively during cold rolling at room temperature of coarsegrained plate or sheet.

        <p>The microstructure of extruded pure Mg is influenced by the parameters such as extrusion temperature, extrusion speed and extrusion ratio. The latter two factors generate strain, while the first factor remove the strain, during the extrusion process. In general, the grain size in the extrudate is strongly influenced by the extrusion temperature. For a given extrusion speed and extrusion ratio, the grain size increases with increasing temperature, even though the texture changes little with the extrusion temperature, Fig. 24. The microstructures of pure Mg extruded at 65°C, 250°C and 400°C are shown in Fig. 25. All three microstructures have the same basal texture, with the c-axes of grains nearly perpendicular to the extrusion direction. However, the distribution of the c-axes of grains along the radial directions within the extrudate cross section is generally not symmetrical. As shown in Fig. 26, a smaller fraction of grains have their c-axis parallel to the radical direction ERD1, but the fraction of grains having their c-axis parallel to the radical direction ERD2 is larger. For the specimens extruded at 65°C and 250°C, the 〈101 � 0〉 axes of most grains are nearly parallel to the extrusion direction, but for the specimen extruded at 400°C, most grains have their 〈112 � 0〉 axes nearly parallel to the extrusion direction, Fig. 25. The grain size in the above cases varies significantly with extrusion temperature. The grain size is ~ 0.8 µm, 8.1 µm and 82 µm respectively for extrusion at 65°C, 250°C and 400°C. Figure 27 shows stress-strain curves of these three specimens, together with those from specimens extruded at other temperatures, obtained under uniaxial compression at a strain rate of 10 -3 s -1 at room temperature. The specimen extruded at 400 °C has poor formability, fractured after ~20% reduction in height. A large fraction of deformation twins and slip traces are observed in the fractured sample. In general, specimens extruded in the temperature range 200-400°C exhibit strain hardening after yielding has occurred. The level of strain hardening decreases with decreasing temperature. For specimens extruded in the temperature range 20-80°C, there is no strain hardening after yielding. The true stress decreases gradually with strain, implying the insignificance of twinning and dislocation slip during the continued deformation. In fact, deformation twins and slip traces are rarely detectable in these specimens after considerably large deformation. It is currently unclear whether the room temperature super-formability of these specimens is attributable to mechanisms such as grain boundary sliding, and further research is needed in the future. The super-formability of the specimen extruded at 80°C is demonstrated in Fig. 3.20. This specimen can be compressed from 10 mm to 1.5 mm at which the compression is stopped due to the machine limit.The microstructure of extruded pure Mg is influenced by the parameters such as extrusion temperature, extrusion speed and extrusion ratio.

        <p>Figure 28 shows the relationship between 0.2% proof strength and grain size for wrought pure Mg, including rolled sheet and bar (tested along RD), extrudate (tested along ED) and equal-channel angular processed (ECAP) bar (tested along ED). The strain rate used in the testing is also provided. In the regime where the grain size is large, the 0.2% proof strength increases with grain size reduction, and the k value (slope in the plot) is between 100 and 250 MPa•µm 0.5 , depending on the loading direction with respect to the basal texture orientation, the intensity of the basal texture, and the strain rate involved in the testing. It is known that the k value is influenced by texture [59]. The maximum value of 250 MPa•µm 0.5 is smaller than that (280 MPa•µm 0.5 ) measured from cast polycrystalline Mg that has random texture and much larger grains size [60]. In the regime of ultra-fine grains, a reverse Hall-Petch relationship is observed. The 0.2% proof strength decreases with decreasing grain size, with a k value ranging from -115 to -65 MPa•µm 0.5 , again depending on the loading orientation and strain rate. The breakdown of Hall-Petch relationship in ultrafine-grained pure Mg occurs in both tensile and compression tests. The critical grain size for the breakdown of Hall-Petch relationship is sensitive to strain rate: it is ~2 µm at 10 -3 s -1 , but it becomes ~3 µm at 10 -5 s -1 . While it is possible that a transition of the dominant deformation mode from intra-granular to inter-granular mode occurs when the grain size decreases below a critical value, it remains to be carefully examined whether inter-granular deformation takes place as a dominant mode in the deformation of ultrafine-grained Mg and, if so, which type it is. While dynamic recrystallization may also occur during the deformation, its role is again unclear and this aspect requires further study.Figure 28 shows the relationship between 0.2% proof strength and grain size for wrought pure Mg, including rolled sheet and bar (tested along RD), extrudate (tested along ED) and equal-channel angular processed (ECAP) bar (tested along ED).

        <p>The stress-strain curve of Orientation ZT is similar to those of single-crystal orientations A and B in Fig. 29. Since the c-axes of most grains in the plate are not precisely parallel to the loading direction, basal slip can occur readily, leading to significant lowering of the stress-strain curves relative to those for single crystals. Nevertheless, Orientation ZT is the hardest along the six orientations of the plate. The stress-strain curve of Orientation ZR is remarkably lower than that of Orientation ZT. The reason of this softer orientation than ZT is because of the greater spread of the basal poles about the transverse direction than the rolling direction, which makes basal slip more favourable in a greater percent of the grains.

        <p>Orientations TZ and RZ are similar to single-crystal orientations E and F in Fig. 29. They deform plastically via the extensive formation of {101 � 2} twins in the initial stage of straining. In contrast to the curves of single crystals E and F, the strain hardening rate increases gradually with increasing strain in the strain range 0.01-0.05. This phenomenon is attributed to diversity of the grain orientations and grain-size effect. In the polycrystalline specimen, the twin, and the strain it carries, can extend only within the small volume of a grain, instead of the full dimension of the specimen in the case of a single crystal. Other twins must be activated in the neighbouring grain to extend the strain, which cause a hardening. While the grain-size effect has been recognised, the quantitative effects of grain size on the deformation behaviour remain to be assessed and examined. As will be discussed in the following, a smaller grain size (less than 1-2 µm) can eliminate twinning and the tension-compression asymmetry.Orientations TZ and RZ are similar to single-crystal orientations E and F in Fig. 29.

        <p>Stretch formability of hot-rolled sheet of pure Mg has been evaluated by Erichsen cupping test. The plate used for hot rolling is cut from an extruded bar, then hot rolled repeatedly at 300°C from 5 mm down to 1 mm, along the direction that is at 90° to the extrusion direction and with 15% thickness reduction each rolling pass. The roller is controlled to have a temperature of 80°C and the final sheet was annealed at 345°C to remove the residual stress in the sheet. The punch diameter and punching speed of the Erichsen test are 20 mm diameter and 0.0833 mm s -1 respectively, similar to those used for single crystals. The microstructure of the hot-rolled sheet contains equiaxed grains of ~24 µm. There is a strong basal sheet texture at both surface and centre of the sheet, Fig. 30. Tensile properties and Lankford r-values, obtained at a strain rate of 1.7 × 10 -3 s -1 at room temperature along three different directions, are also provided in Fig. 30. Based on these data, the average r-value and the anisotropy of the r values, ∆r which is defined by the difference between the maximum and minimum, are calculated and also included in the figure. The Erichsen index value is 3.1 mm at room temperature which is almost two times larger than the single crystal (0001) sheet, Table 1. While the better stretch formability of the polycrystalline sheet is attributable to the deviation of c-axes from the sheet normal direction, which makes basal slip more favourable in a large fraction of grains, the effects of grain size and grain size distribution on stretch formability remain to be explored in the future. b. Elevated temperature Deformation behaviour of textured polycrystalline pure Mg at high temperatures has received much less attention. The difficulty involved in the assessment is the thermal stability of grains during the deformation process at high temperatures, depending on the grain size and strain rate. It is imaginable that specimens have finer grains and subjected to longer testing time are prone to grain growth and texture evolution during the hot deformation. At higher temperature, dynamic recrystallization may also occur. Figure 31(a) shows engineering stress-strain curves of rolled sheet of pure Mg tested at a strain rate of 1.7 × 10 -4 s -1 in the temperature range -196-250°C (77-523K) [63]. The texture of the sheet was not specified in this work, but the grain size before testing is 47 µm. As expected, the 0.2% proof strength of the sheet decreases with increasing temperature, while the ductility increases substantially when the temperature is increased from 20°C to 250°C. Data of 0.2% proof strength obtained from the same sheet but having different grain sizes are provided in Fig. 31(b), under the same testing condition and in the temperature range -196-250°C. From these data, it is also possible to deduce the Hall-Petch relationship between the 0.2% proof strength and initial grain size (the size of grain before testing). The slope of the data, k value, at 25°C is 9.2 MPa•mm 0.5 or 291 MPa•µm 0.5 , which is larger than those shown in Fig. 28. It should be noted that the precise value of k may vary in each case, depending on how the data points are linked or approximated to define the slope of the line. If this uncertainty is into account, then the difference between the two k values is not significant. The k value is apparently temperature-dependent: it decreases with increasing temperature, with a value of ~62 MPa•µm 0.5 at 200°C and ~37 MPa•µm 0.5 at 250°C. It should be noted that the grain size used in this work is in the range 43-172 µm and that such grains are expected to be relatively thermally stable during the tensile testing in the temperature range -196-250°C.

        <p>1. Single crystals In contrast to single crystal of pure Mg, single crystals of Mg alloys have received much less research, primarily because they are more difficult to fabricate than pure Mg. Studies of deformation behaviour of Mg-0.5Al, Mg-1Al, and Mg-2.6Al-0.3Zn (at.%) single-crystal alloys [48,64], under uniaxial tension along 〈112 � 0〉, indicates that the binary and the ternary alloys are both much stronger than pure Mg under similar testing condition, Fig. 11. At room temperature, the ternary alloy exhibits a fairly apparent elastic deformation up to ~ 130 MPa, followed by yielding and serrated flow of the stress-strain curves before fractured at a total strain of ~0.05, which is slightly larger than that of pure Mg. The plastic deformation of the ternary alloy is accompanied by occurrence of be {101 � 1}〈1 � 012〉 twinning and pyramidal I slip.1.

        <p>2. Polycrystalline plate and sheet a. Microstructures of rolled plate and sheet It is well-known that the addition of Al to Mg does not lead to any noticeable weakening of basal texture, especially for alloys based of AM and AZ series, irrespective whether the added Al atoms in the alloy are in solid solution or exist in the form of second-phase particles. Such alloys usually contain a small amount of Mn (0.2-0.6 wt%) for the purpose of corrosion resistance. The added Mn reacts with Al to form Al8Mn5 particles during solidification of molten alloy. The presence of such particles, or the residual Mn atoms in the solid solution, does not seem to affect the texture after thermomechanical processing. The grain size and its distribution and microstructure homogeneity vary with strain rate, strain and temperature involved in the deformation processing. In the case of AZ31 alloy, the grain size is typically in the range 5-50 µm after repeated hot rolling and annealing. If AZ31 plate of 12 mm thickness is rolled at 400°C directly from a cast billet to a total rolling strain of 0.7, under the condition of homogenization for 8 hours at 400°C prior to initial hot rolling, annealing for 15 minutes at 400°C after each rolling pass, and an average rolling strain rate of ~ 0.1 s -1 , then the microstructure is always incompletely recrystallized and inhomogeneous, irrespective of the number of rolling passes [65]. The partial recrystallization is attributed to the much coarser grains in the stating microstructure, implying the importance of grain-boundary nucleation of recrystallization. This observation suggests that, if a fully recrystallized microstructure is to be obtained, then it is better to adopt repeated hot rolling, with a small rolling strain per pass, instead of using less passes with a large strain per pass. The grain boundary area is expected to increase during the repeated hot rolling and annealing process, which in turn, leading to more increased nucleation sites for recrystallization. Comparison of hot-and cold-rolled AZ31 plate indicates that repeated hot rolling and annealing at 400°C is more effective in generating a fully recrystallized microstructure than heavy pass rolling and annealing.2.

        <p>Figure 32 shows microstructures of AZ31 thin plate after hot rolling at 400°C and subsequent annealing for 30 minutes at different temperatures. In this case, as-cast AZ31 billet is rolled from 5 mm to 2.5 mm by 4 passes at 400°C, with a roller surface speed of 2 mm•min -1 and intermediate annealing at 400°C for 15 minutes. After the final rolling pass, the hot-rolled thin plate is quenched in cold water. The hot-rolled microstructure contains a mixture of deformed grains, large in size, and recrystallized grains that are small in size, Fig. 32(a). The partially recrystallized microstructure, the whole area shown in the figure, has a strong (0001) 〈101 � 0〉 texture, i.e. the basal planes of most grains are nearly parallel to the thin plate surface, and 〈101 � 0〉 directions of these grains are nearly parallel to the rolling direction. However, closer inspection of the textures of localized areas indicates clearly that the coarse deformed grains have strong (0001) 〈101 � 0〉 texture, while the fine recrystallized grains have both (0001) 〈211 ���� 0〉 and (0001) 〈101 � 0〉 textures, as shown in Fig. 32(e). The partially recrystallized microstructure remains after annealing at 250°C for 30 minutes, Fig. 32(b). However, the size of the recrystallized grains becomes larger, and the volume fraction of the recrystallized grains is increased. The microstructure still has a (0001) 〈101 � 0〉 texture, but its texture intensity is now much lower than that of the hot-rolled condition. The thin plate becomes fully recrystallized when the annealing of 30 minutes is carried out at 300°C, Fig. 32(c). The microstructure contains a uniform distribution of recrystallized grains of more uniform sizes. Furthermore, the basal texture intensity in the (0001) pole figure decreases further, to ~ 3 mrd, and most grains now have their directions lying between 〈101 � 0〉 and 〈211 ���� 0〉 parallel to the RD.

It has a basal texture, with an intensity of 9 mrd in the (0002) pole figure. The basal poles spread slightly towards the rolling direction.

There are several interpretations of the texture transition. One school of thoughts attributes it to anisotropy of grain boundary energy and mobility [67], while another school to discontinuous nucleation and growth of recrystallized grains, i.e. not a recovery process like in-situ, or continuous, recrystallization [68]. It has also been proposed that this transition is due to preferential growth of recrystallized grains when they share a 30°[0001] orientation relationship to the deformed matrix [67]. While these interpretations can explain some features of the texture evolution, none of them offers an explanation that is fully consistent with experimental observations. It is currently unclear why the (0001) 〈211 ���� 0〉 texture will replace the (0001) 〈101 � 0〉 texture during grain growth and what mechanism is operating in the texture change. Perhaps an important clue is the presence of a continuous spectrum of grain orientations lying from 〈101 � 0〉 to 〈211 ���� 0〉, Fig. 32(c), which indicates unambiguously the occurrence of other in-plane textures before (0001) 〈211 ���� 0〉 become the dominant texture component.While the transition from (0001) 〈101 � 0〉 texture to (0001) 〈211 ���� 0〉 during annealing at high temperatures has now been well documented for AZ31 and pure Mg, the origin and the mechanism remain unclear.

        <p>b. Plastic deformation of rolled plate and sheet Figure 33 shows stress-strain curves of AZ31 plate under plane-strain compression at a strain rate of 10 -2 s -1 in the temperature range 20-450°C, for three different orientations with respect to the compression direction [69]. The plate has a strong basal texture and an average grain size of 25 µm before the tests, but the information of grain size distribution and texture intensity were not provided. At room temperature, Fig. 33(a), compression along the ND leads to high yield stress and high strain hardening rate. In contrast, loading along the TD causes yielding occurred at ~ 70 MPa. After yielding, the strain hardening rate is initially low, but increases significantly with strain after ~ 0.05 strain. The plastic deformation below 0.05 strain is reportedly caused by an extensive formation of {101 � 2} twin. Microstructures of TD, RD, and ND specimens after 0.1 compression strain at 250°C are also shown in Fig. 33. The fraction of twins reduces to about 60% and 5% respectively when TD and RD specimens are deformed at 250°C. The tension twin is absent in the ND specimen deformed under similar condition. While the experimental stress-strain curves at warm and high temperatures are reproduced by using visco-plastic self-consistent (VPSC) model, this model considers different combinations of different deformation modes, including those thermally activated slip and twinning modes, the contribution of dynamic recrystallization is not considered. It has been reported that AZ31 undergoes recrystallization during plane-strain compression at temperature above 200°C [68]. It is rather unfortunate that the formation temperature and kinetics of recrystallization under different loading conditions have not been systematically explored so far.b.

        <p>The influences of strain rate, strain and temperature on dynamic recrystallization, under the condition of uniaxial compression at a strain rate in the range 0.01-1 s -1 at 300-450°C, are examined using both wrought (fine grain) and as-cast (coarse grain) specimens of AZ31 [70]. The specimen is quenched in water after a desired strain is reached. In this study, Beer and Barnett found that the level of dynamic recrysallization (DRX) and the size of the dynamically recrystallized grains are both sensitive to the applied deformation conditions and the initial microstructure. Higher temperatures and lower strain rates, thus smaller values of the Zener-Hollomon parameter Z, leads to larger percentages of DRX and larger sizes of dynamically recrystallized grains. The recrystallized grains in the wrought specimen are smaller than those in the as-cast specimen, and the kinetics of DRX in the wrought specimen is much higher than for that in the as-cast specimen. Furthermore, DRX does not fully occur with decreasing Z in the as-cast specimen.

The specimen is quenched in water after a desired strain is reached. In this study, Beer and Barnett found that the level of dynamic recrysallization (DRX) and the size of the dynamically recrystallized grains are both sensitive to the applied deformation conditions and the initial microstructure. Higher temperatures and lower strain rates, thus smaller values of the Zener-Hollomon parameter Z, leads to larger percentages of DRX and larger sizes of dynamically recrystallized grains. The recrystallized grains in the wrought specimen are smaller than those in the as-cast specimen, and the kinetics of DRX in the wrought specimen is much higher than for that in the as-cast specimen. Furthermore, DRX does not fully occur with decreasing Z in the as-cast specimen.

        <p>The room temperature stretch formability and uniaxial tensile properties of AM sheet containing different contents of Al are shown in Fig. 34. These sheets are produced by hot rolling from extruded plates. The as-cast billets are initially extruded at 400°C into plates of 5 mm thickness, which is subsequently rolled at 460°C to 1.26 mm thickness by six rolling passes, followed by a final rolling pass to 1 mm thickness at 500-550°C, which is unusually high for rolling. Such temperatures are very close to the solidus temperatures of individual alloys. The rolled sheets are subsequently annealed for 1 hour at 350°C. The Erichsen tests are carried out with a hemispherical punch of 20 mm diameter, but the punching speed was not provided. Uniaxial tensile tests are made at an initial strain rate of 3 × 10 -3 s -1 . The hot-rolled sheets of AM alloys all have a strong basal sheet texture. The final annealing significantly weakens the basal sheet texture, with AM60 sheet having the weakest texture and AM80 processing the strongest. The microstructures of these sheets contain a uniform distribution of recrystallized grains of equiaxed shape and 10-17 µm size. The Erichsen values of these sheets are provided in Fig. 34. The stretch formability of the AM40-AM70 sheets is surprisingly outstanding, as their Erichsen values are compatible with those of commercial Al alloys, Table II and Fig. 50. In general, the Erichsen values of the sheets made from alloys of similar compositions, such as AZ31, is around 4 or less. The superior room-temperature formability of such sheets is associated with significantly weakened basal texture of the sheets in the annealed state, as shown in Fig. 34. The weakened basal texture is associated with the unusually high temperature used for finishing rolling. Effects of finishing rolling temperature on basal texture intensity, Erichsen value, elongation and rvalue of AZ31 sheet are shown in Fig. 35. When the finishing rolling temperature is at or above 525°C, the basal texture intensity and r-value both drop to minimum, while Erichsen value and elongation reach their maximum. While it has been demonstrated that the basal texture intensity of this group of alloys can be significantly weakened by the use of high temperatures for the final rolling, it is unclear how and why the basal texture become significantly weakened when the final rolling temperature is as high as just below the solidus temperature of the alloy.

        <p>It has been demonstrated recently [81] that it is possible to achieve high formability and high strength simultaneously in a twin-roll cast, hot-rolled and annealed AZMX3110 (Mg-3Al-1Zn-1Mn-0.5Ca, wt.%) alloy. This alloy has an Erichsen index of 8 mm and a yield strength of 219 MPa when tested at room temperature. Another study of similar alloy systems but with dilute alloying additions demonstrated that it is possible to develop an age hardenable alloy with good balance and strength and room temperature formability [82]. After multi-stage hot and warm rolling, the rolled sheet of Mg-1.1Al-0.3Ca-0.2Mn-0.3Zn alloy is solution treated at 450°C for 1 hour before tensile testing at an initial strain rate of 10 -3 s -1 and Erichsen testing with 20 mm punch diameter and 6 mm•min -1 speed at room temperature. In the solution treated condition (T4), the sheet has a fully recrystallized microstructure with an average grain size of 11 µm. It has a significantly weakened basal texture, with the distribution of basal poles having both RD-split and TD split, which is similar to the texture of Mg-Zn-Y sheet [83]. The intensity maxima of basal poles is tilted not only by about ±10° from ND towards RD, but also by about ±40° from ND towards TD. The sheet has tensile yield strength of 144 MPa and ductility of 32% and an Erichsen value of 7.7 in the solution treated condition. Peakageing at 200°C increases the yield strength to 204 MPa at the expense of a slight drop of ductility. The composition of the alloy is reportedly critical for achieving the good combination of strength and formability. The Erichsen value decreases when 0.3wt.%Zn is removed from the alloy. The age hardening response disappears when the Ca content is reduced from 0.3wt.% to 0.06wt.%. c. Polycrystalline extrudate The alloy AZ31 is also commonly used for extrusion. The extruded AZ31 usually has a strong basal texture after hot extrusion, with basal planes and 〈101 � 0〉 directions of most grains nearly parallel to the extrusion direction. The formation of this texture during hot extrusion is illustrated in Fig. 36. The as-cast billet is homogenized at 415°C for 16 hours and extruded at 300°C using indirect extrusion at a ram speed of 10 mm•s -1 and an extrusion ratio of 20:1. When the specimen has been partially extruded, and it is taken out from an interrupted extrusion process and immediately quenched into water to avoid annealing during cooling. The microstructure changes gradually as the material flows toward the die exit, Fig. 36(a). At distance of 15 mm from the die exit, original grains are still retained, even though many twins have formed inside some of these grains, Fig. 36(b), and a 〈101 � 0〉 fibre component has already emerged from the originally random texture, Fig. 36(c). DRX starts at the position of 10 mm, where the basal planes become lying parallel to the ED and the 〈101 � 0〉 fibre component became stronger, Fig. 36(d). The percentage of dynamically recrystallized grains increases with a further increase in distance towards die exit. Accompanied with this event, the original grains now become elongated along the ED, leading to a bimodal microstructure. A weak 〈211 ���� 0〉 fibre component also forms gradually and strengthens with a decreasing distance to the die exit, with both 〈211 ���� 0〉 and 〈101 � 0〉 fibre components formed at the position of 5 mm from the die exit, Fig. 36(e). Complete DRX occurs at the die exit (0 mm position), and the microstructure has a basal texture, with most grains having their directions lying between 〈101 � 0〉 and 〈211 ���� 0〉 parallel to the RD [84]. In this case, the as-cast billet is directly extruded at 175°C, 300°C, and 400 °C with an extrusion ram speed of 0.1 mm•s -1 and at 400 °C with an extrusion ram speed of 3 mm•s -1 . The microstructure of extrudate at 175°C has equiaxed grains of an average diameter 0.65 μm, Fig. 37. The dominant presence of sub-micron grains indicates the occurrence of dynamic recrystallization during extruding at this temperature. The microstructure has a typical extrusion texture, with the 〈101 � 0〉 axes of most grains nearly parallel to the extrusion direction, and a texture intensity of 4.7 multiples of a random distribution (mrd). With an increase in extrusion temperature or extrusion speed, more grains have their 〈101 � 0〉 axes tilted away from the RD and their 〈211 ���� 0〉 axes tilted towards the RD, even though 〈101 � 0〉 ~ // RD texture is still the dominant texture. The average grain size increases from 0.65 μm to 5.3 μm, as the extrusion temperature is increased from 175°C to 400°C. For extrusion at 400°C, an increase in extrusion speed from 0.1 mm•s -1 to 3 mm•s -1 , the average grain size increases to ~ 14 μm. Irrespective of the extrusion condition, strong segregation of Zn atoms in grain boundaries is found. There is little noticeable segregation of Al and Mn atoms. The Al and Mn atoms form some intermetallic dispersoids along grain boundaries. [85]. Fig. 38(a) shows room temperature tension and compression properties of AZ31 extruded under different conditions. After extrusion at a high temperature, e.g. 400°C, and a relative high ram speed, e.g. 3 mm•s -1 , the yield strength is about 195 MPa when tested in tension and 123 MPa in the compression test. The alloy exhibits apparent tension-compression yield asymmetry. A decrease in the extrusion speed to 0.1 mm•s -1 at 400°C leads to a tensile and compressive yield strength of 218 MPa and 165 MPa, respectively. Again, there exists tension-compression yield asymmetry, even though the gap between the tensile and compressive strengths is now reduced. Decreasing the extrusion temperature leads to continuous reduction in tension-compression yield asymmetry. When the extrusion temperature is decreased to 175°C, the strengths of tension and compression are both of 380 MPa, and the tension-compression yield asymmetry has now disappeared. The high strength is attributable to the ultra-fine grain size obtained at this extrusion temperature. While the grain size and texture in AZ31 in this condition are similar to those in pure Mg extruded at low temperatures, the difference in yield strength of AZ31 and pure Mg, either in tension or compression tests, is remarkably high. The only microstructural difference between the two is the presence of Zn segregation in grain boundaries in AZ31. It has been proposed [85] that the Zn segregation, together with the presence of Al-Mn dispersoids, in grain boundaries suppresses the inter-granular deformation that operates in pure Mg, switching the deformation mode from grain boundary sliding to intragranular modes of twinning and slip. Strain-rate sensitivity test of the sub-micron AZ31 reveals a much smaller sensitivity (∼0.014) than that of pure Mg (∼0.2), Fig. 38(b), further supporting the operation of intra-granular deformation modes in the AZ31.

        <p>Ultra-high strength has been achieved in extruded alloys based on the Mg-Al-Ca-Mn system [86]. After extrusion at 350°C and 20:1 ratio and a low ram speed, 0.1 mm•s -1 , the microstructure of Mg-3.5Al-3.3Ca-0.4Mn (wt.%) alloy has mixed distribution of dynamically recrystallized grains, ~ 1 µm, elongated strips of deformed grains, intermetallic particles of about ~ 0.5 µm, and nano-scale precipitates.

The microstructure has a strong basal texture, with c-axes of most grains lying perpendicular to the extrusion direction and 〈101 � 0〉 axes lying close to the extrusion direction. Under the condition of tensile testing at room temperature and at 10 -3 s -1 strain rate, the alloy exhibits a 0.2% proof stress of 410 MPa and an elongation to failure of 5.6%.Ultra-high strength has been achieved in extruded alloys based on the Mg-Al-Ca-Mn system [86].

        <p>The extrusion limit of magnesium alloys is influenced by their compositions. For alloys such as AZ31, the maximum extrusion (die-exit) speed is typically less than 20 m•min -1 . A trend of extrusion alloy development is to reduce the total content of alloying elements in the alloy to increase the extrusion speed and therefore reduce the processing cost. A recent study has demonstrated that Mg-1.3Al-0.3Ca-0.4Mn (wt.%) alloy can be extruded at a die-exist speed of 24 m•min -1 , that is comparable to that of aluminium extrusions [87]. A more recent study indicates that Mg-Al-Ca-Mn alloy's extrudability can be substantially increased from 24 m•min -1 to 60 m•min -1 by reducing the Ca content from 0.33 wt% to 0.24 wt%. Four alloys, namely Mg-1.08Al-0.24Ca (AX102), Mg-1.08Al-0.24Ca-0.27Mn (AXM10203), Mg-1.08Al-0.24Ca-0.68Mn (AXM10207), and Mg-1.08Al-0.24Ca-1.03Mn (AXM1021), are indirectly extruded at 350°C with an extrusion ratio of 20:1 and a die-exit speed of 60 m•min -1 . The extrudate is solution treatment at 500°C for 10 minutes, followed by water quench and peak ageing at 170°C. These alloys have an average grain size of ~ 77 μm, 18 μm, 12 μm, and 10 μm, respectively. They have a relatively weak basal texture, with most grains having their 〈101 � 0〉-〈211 ���� 0〉 directions parallel to the RD, Fig. 39(a). The engineering stress-strain curves of these alloys, obtained under tension and compression at room temperature, are provided in Fig. 39(b-e).

Microstructures of rolled plate and sheet Figure 40 shows microstructures of Mg-1.06wt%Zn alloy after 23% cold rolling and annealing of different times at 350°C. In the cold-rolled condition, the alloy has a strong basal texture, 〈101 � 0〉 // RD, with the texture intensity about 10.5 mrd. The strong basal texture is caused predominantly by formation and growth of {10 1 � 2} extension twins whose c-axes are nearly parallel to the ND. Observations made on the same alloy but with 6% cold work indicates that 36% of the sample surface is already occupied by {101 � 2} twin. {101 � 1} twin and secondary twin are not detected, but a large fraction of shear bands is visible in the cold-rolled microstructure. Rapid recrystallization and texture weakening occurs simultaneously during annealing at 350°C. After 5 seconds, about 79% area fraction has recrystallized. The texture intensity now decreases to about 6.1 mrd, and the 〈112 � 0〉 // RD texture component has formed even though its intensity is weak. The recrystallized grains occupy ~94% of the area after 100 seconds, and fully replace the deformed grains after 900 seconds.

B. Mg-Zn Based Alloys 1. Polycrystalline plate and sheet a. Microstructures of rolled plate and sheet Figure 40 shows microstructures of Mg-1.06wt%Zn alloy after 23% cold rolling and annealing of different times at 350°C. In the cold-rolled condition, the alloy has a strong basal texture, 〈101 � 0〉 // RD, with the texture intensity about 10.5 mrd. The strong basal texture is caused predominantly by formation and growth of {10 1 � 2} extension twins whose c-axes are nearly parallel to the ND. Observations made on the same alloy but with 6% cold work indicates that 36% of the sample surface is already occupied by {101 � 2} twin. {101 � 1} twin and secondary twin are not detected, but a large fraction of shear bands is visible in the cold-rolled microstructure. Rapid recrystallization and texture weakening occurs simultaneously during annealing at 350°C. After 5 seconds, about 79% area fraction has recrystallized. The texture intensity now decreases to about 6.1 mrd, and the 〈112 � 0〉 // RD texture component has formed even though its intensity is weak. The recrystallized grains occupy ~94% of the area after 100 seconds, and fully replace the deformed grains after 900 seconds. There is little further weakening of the basal texture after 100 second, but the 〈112 � 0〉 // RD texture component becomes stronger with annealing time. Table III.

        <p>Effect of ternary addition of a small amount of Ca on microstructure and its evolution is also shown in Fig. 40. For the purpose of comparison, the ternary alloy, Mg-0.8Zn-0.16Ca (wt.%), is produced under similar conditions. In the cold-rolled condition, there are less shear bands than the Mg-1.06wt%Zn alloy. However, the alloy still has a basal texture, with its intensity of about 6.9 mrd, which is much lower than that of the counterpart binary alloy. The 〈101 � 0〉 // RD texture component is also smaller than the counterpart binary alloy, and grains with directions other than 〈101 � 0〉 now parallel to the RD. There is little change in the texture intensity after 20 seconds annealing at 350°C. The area fraction of recrystallized grains is about 8% at this time, increases to about 77% after 100 seconds and completes at 900 seconds. The texture is significantly weakened after 100 seconds and it changes little during prolonged annealing. At 900 seconds, the basal texture poles split away from ND towards the TD in the pole figure, leading to a TD-split texture that is also associated with sheet of some Mg-Zn-RE alloys.Effect of ternary addition of a small amount of Ca on microstructure and its evolution is also shown in Fig. 40.

        <p>Figure 41 shows the texture evolution of recrystallized grains that have formed inside shear bands in the ternary alloy during annealing at 350°C. After 14 second, recrystallized grains have formed and their texture is similar to that of the deformed grain. With continued annealing, new recrystallized grains continuous to form in this region and the recrystallized grains grow to larger size. More randomized orientations, hence a weakened basal texture, are observed after 115 seconds. These grains form outside the shear bands and have grown into the neighbouring deformed grains. The orientations of these grains are tilted away from ND. It is the formation and growth of such recrystallized grains that leads to the weakened recrystallization texture. Solute segregation to boundaries of recrystallized grains occurs and persist through the annealing process. It has been hypothesised that Zn and Ca atoms co-segregate strongly to high-energy boundaries of the recrystallized grains that would otherwise grow preferentially. The co-segregation to such grain boundaries is expected to reduce, more effectively than that from sole segregation of Zn or Ca, their mobility by reducing the boundary energy and exerting a solute dragging effect, which in turn lead to a more uniform growth of recrystallized grains. An alloy with a Mg-0.8Zn-0.16Ca composition would be normally regarded as a solid solution single-phase alloy and thus it would not be expected to exhibit any hardening response during isothermal ageing in the temperature range 80-200°C. However, it was reported [101] that annealing of cold deformed sheet of this alloy leads to a remarkable strengthening, rather than softening, effect in a wide range of deformation and annealing conditions. This observation has an implication to alloy design, as the alloy could be formed in a cold state and become stronger after appropriate postforming ageing.Figure 41 shows the texture evolution of recrystallized grains that have formed inside shear bands in the ternary alloy during annealing at 350°C.

        <p>Ternary additions of Mn or Zr to Mg-Zn alloys does not change the texture [102]. However, additions of RE elements to Mg-Zn alloys can lead to remarkable change in microstructure [102]. Comparison of textures of hot-rolled and annealed sheets of ZE10, ZEK100, ZEK410 and ZW41 alloys indicates the presence of similar features: their intensities are all weak; the angular distribution of c-axes is remarkably broader towards TD, TD-split texture; and 〈101 � 0〉 axes tend to lie close to the sheet plane, instead of lying perpendicular to the sheet plane as in binary Mg-Zn and AZ31 alloys.

        <p>Under similar processing conditions, textures of Mg-1Zn-1Ce-0.6Zr and Mg-1Zn-1Gd-0.6Zr (wt.%) alloy sheets are similar to those of Mg-1Ce and Mg-1Gd alloys [103], as will be shown in the following section on Mg-RE alloys. In the as-hot-rolled condition, the RD-ND plane of the Mg-1Zn-1Ce-0.6Zr and Mg-1Zn-1Gd-0.6Zr sheets show a high density of shear bands, resulting from a severe plastic deformation imposed by 80% thickness reduction in by a single pass. Both sheets have a weakened basal texture. The basal poles of maximum intensity split into two peaks, with the maximum of each peak being tilted by ~ 20° away from sheet ND towards RD. The texture of the hot-rolled Mg-1Zn-1Ce-0.6Zr alloy becomes much weaker after annealing at 350°C and above, while significant texture change occurs at and above 300°C. The original basal texture is replaced by the TD-split texture that has a weak intensity. The room temperature tensile properties of these two alloys are much better than their counterpart Mg-1Ce and Mg-1Gd alloys.Under similar processing conditions, textures of Mg-1Zn-1Ce-0.6Zr and Mg-1Zn-1Gd-0.6Zr (wt.%) alloy sheets are similar to those of Mg-1Ce and Mg-1Gd alloys [103], as will be shown in the following section on Mg-RE alloys.

        <p>Effect of cold rolling of hot-rolled ZEK100 (Mg-1.3Zn-0.2Nd-0.3Zr, wt.%), and subsequent annealing, on texture and its evolution has been examined in a recent study [104]. Cold rolling is made following three different strain paths, with an attempt to changing dislocation and shear band activity. The initial hot-rolled microstructure is largely recrystallized, and it contains grains with an average size of 12 µm. The texture has the characteristic split basal texture of ZEK100, forming two intensity maxima that split by 30° towards TD. It is found that cold rolling either parallel or perpendicular to the hot rolling direction leads to distinct shear banding, but continuous rotating of the sheet between cold rolling passes suppresses the shear band formation. With the absence of shear bands, the TD-split texture is not produced upon annealing for full recrystallization. It was suggested that it is the strain path, rather than the dislocation activity, that determines shear band evolution and the formation of TD-split texture. Table IV b. Rollability and formability of rolled sheet Some attempts have been made to increase plate thickness reduction per pass by changing the rolling speed. Larger thickness reduction per pass and higher rolling speed can reduce processing cost. This is beneficial especially when it is made without sacrificing useful formability and mechanical properties. A recent study [110] indicates that an increase in rolling speed from 2 m•min -1 to 15 m•min -1 gives rise to significantly enlarged thickness reduction in a single pass of commercial alloys ZEK100 (Mg-1Zn-0.2Nd-0.2Zr, wt%) and AZ31, Fig. 42. Microstructures of the sheets prior to hot rolling contains coarse grains (~ 138 µm) for ZEK 100 and fine grains (~5 µm) for AZ31. The texture of ZEK100 is weaker than that of AZ31. The rollability of the sheets is assessed by their appearance after rolling. Severe cracking occurs at ~ 70% thickness reduction for low speed rolling, while the fast-rolled specimen only has some small edge cracks under the same thickness reduction. AZ31 also showed a similar trend that the rollability increases with increasing the rolling speed: edge cracking occurs at ~65% thickness reduction under fast rolling, but at lower thickness reduction (~40%) under slow rolling.Effect of cold rolling of hot-rolled ZEK100 (Mg-1.3Zn-0.2Nd-0.3Zr, wt.%), and subsequent annealing, on texture and its evolution has been examined in a recent study [104].

        <p>Other studies [111,112] have shown that 80% thickness reduction in a single pass is possible for alloys containing much higher concentrations of Zn, e.g. ZK60 (Mg-6Zn-0.5Zr, wt.%) when a rolling speed of 26 m•min -1 is used for hot rolling at temperatures 250-400°C. However, the resultant sheets have an incomplete DRX microstructure or relatively coarse recrystallized grains, and consequently their mechanical properties are not desirable. An earlier study [113] indicates that the use of an even higher rolling speed, in the range 450-2000 m•min -1 , can lead to a remarkable improvement of the rollability of AZ31. With this ultra-high-speed rolling, the maximum thickness reduction per pass can be increased up to 60% without any surface cracks, even when rolling is done at relatively low temperatures (200-350°C) [114]. It is to be noted that the ultra-fast rolling speed makes this technology challenging for industrial applications.Other studies [111,112] have shown that 80% thickness reduction in a single pass is possible for alloys containing much higher concentrations of Zn, e.g. ZK60 (Mg-6Zn-0.5Zr, wt.%) when a rolling speed of 26 m•min -1 is used for hot rolling at temperatures 250-400°C.

        <p>Room temperature formability of Mg-Zn-Ca and Mg-Zn-RE alloy sheets have been evaluated by Erichsen tests. After hot extrusion at 400°C, hot rolling at 500°C and annealing at 350°C, Mg-1.52Zn-0.07Ca (wt.%) alloy sheet has an Erichsen value of 8.2 [115], Mg-1.5Zn-0.2Y alloy has an Erichsen value of 9.2 [83], and Mg-1.5Zn-0.2Ce alloy has a deep drawing ratio of 1.8 [116], which is compatible with that of commercial Al alloys. While the excellent formability is attributed to the formation of the TD-split texture, it remains to be evaluated whether the excellent formability is also related with the hot extrusion adopted before hot rolling. The total content of alloying additions in these alloys is relatively low, compared with that of AZ31 (~ 4wt.%), to avoid the formation of second-phase particles that can cause deterioration of stretch formability.Room temperature formability of Mg-Zn-Ca and Mg-Zn-RE alloy sheets have been evaluated by Erichsen tests.

        <p>Possibility for fast extrusion has been explored recently for alloys based on the Mg-Zn-Ca-Mn and Mg-Zn-RE systems [118,119]. The total content of added alloying element is generally low, in order to reduce the flow stress of the alloy during hot extrusion and to increase the solidus temperature of the alloy to avoid hot cracking. One example is a Mg-0.53Zn-0.24Ca-0.27Mn (wt.%) alloy that is indirectly extruded at 300°C with an extrusion ratio of 20:1 and die-exit speed of 6-60 m•min -1 . The surface finish looks smooth and shiny for an extrusion speed up to 24 m•min -1 , Fig. 43. Any speed above that leads to cracking on the extrusion surface. Extrusions made with extrusion speeds in the range 6-60 m•min -1 all have fully recrystallized microstructure, together with second-phase particles distributed in lines along the extrusion direction. The average grain size increases with increasing extrusion speed. The extrusions have weak textures. The poles lying along the extrusion direction spread in an angular region defined by 〈211 ���� 4〉, 〈211 ���� 2〉, 〈101 � 2〉, 〈202 � 3〉, with an intensity of 2.2-2.6, as indicated in the inverse pole figures in Fig. 43. The intensity maxima of the poles changes within the angular region when the extrusion speed increases. The texture component of the specimen extruded at 6 m•min -1 is close to that of extruded Mg-RE binary alloys. The variation of texture with extrusion speed is also observed in extruded Mg-1.58Zn-0.52Gd (wt.%) alloy [119].

        <p>Figure 44 shows the (0002) pole figure of Mg-1wt%Ce and Mg-1wt%Gd alloys, in the hot-rolled condition and the annealed condition. The texture in the as-rolled condition has a weakened basal texture: the c-axes of most grains have a broader distribution than that seen in pure Mg and AZ31, and they also tend to split into double peaks. Within each peak, the c-axes are tilted by about 20° away from sheet normal direction ND toward rolling direction RD. The Ce-containing alloy has a slightly weaker rolling texture than the Gd-containing alloy. Since the alloy sheet is hot rolled by 80% by a single pass, each contains a dense and uniform distribution of shear bands in the RD-ND plane. There is little change in texture when annealing is carried out at 250°C and 300°C. Recrystallization starts to occur along shear bands at 300°C, which is about 100° higher than the recrystallization temperature for AZ31. The increased temperature for recrystallization is attributed to second-phase particles and solute segregation in grain boundaries. Annealing at 350°C and above leads to full recrystallization and basal texture weakening. The texture weakening in the Gd-containing alloy is accompanied by texture change, with the c-axes of grains being tilted further away from the sheet normal direction towards RD (in the range 20-60°).

The texture in the as-rolled condition has a weakened basal texture: the c-axes of most grains have a broader distribution than that seen in pure Mg and AZ31, and they also tend to split from ND toward RD. Again, the texture becomes much weaker after 30 minutes annealing at 400°C. The microstructure has now fully recrystallized grains with an average size of 18 µm.

        <p>Adding larger amount of RE elements does not change the texture from that of dilute alloys, irrespective of the sheet or plate thickness. A recent study of hot-rolled and aged plate of WE43 indicates its microstructure has fully recrystallized grains (~ 30 µm in size) that have a weakened basal texture [134]. The c-axes are scattered by up to 25° away from the plate normal direction towards RD. Room temperature uniaxial tension and compression tests along RD, ND and TD directions of the plate indicate an essential obsence of the tension-compression yield asymmetry along all three directions of the plate.Adding larger amount of RE elements does not change the texture from that of dilute alloys, irrespective of the sheet or plate thickness.

        <p>Application of differential speed rolling (DSR) to WE43 does not seem to change its microstructure [135]. The alloy WE43 is initially extruded into thin plate (5 mm thick) at 450°C and fully annealed at 500°C. The plate is rolled along the extrusion direction by four passes to 1 mm thick, with billet temperature of 550°C and roller temperature of 300°C and roller speed ratio of 1.36. The microstructure has equiaxed grains of 47 µm and a weakened basal texture before DSR, but elongated grains and shear bands and second-phase particles after DSR. The texture is strengthened by the DSR. Subsequent annealing at 450°C for 1 hour leads to full recrystallization. The grain size is about 18 µm and the texture is a weakened basal. In this condition, the WE43 sheet has a yield strength of 141 MPa and an elongation to fracture of 22% and an Erichsen value of 4.4, when tested at room temperature. The difference between stress-strain curves obtained from specimens cut along RD, TD and 45° away from RD is subtle. Deformation of hot-rolled and annealed thick plates of Mg-1wt%Ce and Mg-1wt%Gd alloys have been studied by plane-strain compression at room temperature and a strain rate of 10 -2 s -1 along the plate normal direction and the rolling direction [103]. These two plates have a weakened basal texture, and they contain fully recrystallized grains of about 25 µm for the Ce-containing alloy and 19 µm for the Gd containing alloy. Examination of specimens deformed to different levels of plastic strain reveals that, in each plane-strain compression mode, texture evolves quite differently in the two alloys.

        <p>Room temperature formability of Mg-1.68Gd-1.11Zn (GZ21) and Mg-2.74Gd-1.06Zn (GZ31) (wt.%) alloy sheets is excellent [136]. The alloys are rolled at 430°C and annealed for 1 hour at 400°C before testing. The microstructures of the sheets contain recrystallized grains and second-phase dispersoids that are uniformly distributed in the microstructure. The average grain size is 16 µm and 12 µm respectively in the GZ21 and GZ31 alloys. The basal texture intensity is quite low in each alloy, with the c-axes tilted by up to 30° from the sheet normal direction towards both the rolling direction and the transverse direction. The sheets have good combination of tensile properties and ductility, together with excellent stretch formability, Table VI 2. Polycrystalline extrusion Different from sheet of Mg-RE alloys, extrudate of Mg-RE based alloys exhibit a unique RE-texture, with most grains having their basal planes oriented at ~ 45° to the extrusion direction [95], i.e. with the 〈211 ���� 1〉 direction parallel to the ED. The presence of second-phase particles does not seem to affect the formation of the RE-texture, as it was found subsequently that this RE-texture also forms in a dilute alloys of Mg-1.55wt%Gd and Mg-0.22wt%La [140]. When Mg-1wt%Gd alloy is indirectly extruded at 350°C with an extrusion ratio of 16:1, the microstructure has a mixture of coarse deformed grains and small recrystallized grains, Fi.g 45. The deformd grains are elongated along the ED and they have their basal planes and 〈101 � 0〉 directions parallel to the ED. While the small recrystallized grains were reported to have the same texture as those of the coarse deformed grains, their orientation are clearly different from that of the coarse deformed grains, as indicated by the difference between their colours, Fig. 45(a). One possibility is that the recrystallized grains are embedded in the matrix of the deformed grains, and therefore their orientations are masked by that of the matrix grain, given that continuous DRX was propsoed to occur that involves gradual rotation of sub-grains formed in the matrix grain. As will be shown unambiguously in the next figure, the dynamically recrystallized grains have RE-texture. This view is further supported by the microstructures of the extruded and annealed specimens, Fig. 45(b,c).

        <p>Since some RE elements have high solid solubility in Mg and the others have low solid solubility in Mg, the effects of the identity and concentrations of RE elements on texture have also been studied. The RE elements that have received most attention are Gd, Y, Nd, Ce and Ce-rich misch-metal. Among these elements, Gd, Y and Nd have relatively high solid solubility, while Ce has much less.

The microstructure of Mg-6Y-7Gd-0.5Zr alloy, known as Elektron 675, extruded under different processing conditions are shown in Fig. 47. Extrusion in the temperature range 425-475°C leads to a mixture of coarse and fine grains distributed in bands along the extrusion direction.

A systematic evaluation of effects of extrusion speed and temperature on microstructure and deformation of Mg-1Mn, Mg-1Mn-0.5Nd and Mg-1Mn-1Nd (wt.%) alloys has been made [152], with the extrusion temperatures in the range 275-360°C and the extrusion speed in the range 2.8-11 mm•s -1 .

        <p>It has been demonstrated that Mg-0.3Al-0.21Ca-0.47Mn alloy can be extruded at ultra-fast speed [166]. This alloy is essentially based on the Mg-Mn system, as Mn is the major alloying element in terms of weight percentage in the alloy and the convention used. It is therefore more appropriate to designate this alloy MAX100 instead of AXM0301502. After indirect extrusion at 500°C, with an extrusion ratio of 20:1 and a die-exit speed of 60 m•min -1 , the extrusion is water quenched and aged for 4 hours at 200°C. The as-extruded microstructure has fully recrystallized grains that are ~ 27 µm and a weakened basal texture. The post-extrusion ageing increases the yield strength from 170 MPa in the as-extruded condition to 207 MPa, at the expense of a small drop of ductility.

Mg-Li based alloys Plane-strain compression of single crystals of Mg-4wt%Li alloy along different orientations was studied by Kelley and Hosford [31] and these results were compared with those obtained from single crystals of pure Mg deformed under same conditions, Fig. 8. In orientations C and D, the Mg-Li crystal deforms by prismatic slip, a mode not observed in pure Mg. Uniaxial tension of single crystals of Mg-Li alloys along 〈211 ���� 0〉 orientation indicates that the addition of Li to Mg decreases the yield strength that is dictated by pyramidal II slip [167].It has been demonstrated that Mg-0.3Al-0.21Ca-0.47Mn alloy can be extruded at ultra-fast speed [166]. This alloy is essentially based on the Mg-Mn system, as Mn is the major alloying element in terms of weight percentage in the alloy and the convention used. It is therefore more appropriate to designate this alloy MAX100 instead of AXM0301502. After indirect extrusion at 500°C, with an extrusion ratio of 20:1 and a die-exit speed of 60 m•min -1 , the extrusion is water quenched and aged for 4 hours at 200°C. The as-extruded microstructure has fully recrystallized grains that are ~ 27 µm and a weakened basal texture. The post-extrusion ageing increases the yield strength from 170 MPa in the as-extruded condition to 207 MPa, at the expense of a small drop of ductility.

        <p>Plane-strain compression of as-cast and homogenized polycrystalline Mg-3wt%Li alloy at room temperature and a strain rate of 5 × 10 -3 s -1 indicates the presence of a basal texture after a true strain of ~ 0.3 [168]. The basal poles tend to align with the "normal direction" and with a spreading towards the "rolling" direction. The basal poles have been rotated away from the ND towards the RD by ~ 20°, which is larger than that of pure Mg deformed under the same condition. With the support from simulation results obtained from the viscoplastic self-consistent model, the deformation texture of the Mg-3wt%Li alloy is attributed to increased activity of non-basal 〈𝑐𝑐 + 𝑎𝑎〉 slip mode.Plane-strain compression of as-cast and homogenized polycrystalline Mg-3wt%Li alloy at room temperature and a strain rate of 5 × 10 -3 s -1 indicates the presence of a basal texture after a true strain of ~ 0.3 [168].

        <p>Effects of texture and grain size on deformation of Mg-4wt%Li alloy have been studied [169]. The alloy is extruded at different temperatures (200-300°C) and extrusion ratios (25:1-71:1) to obtain different grain sizes. The as-extruded microstructure has a basal texture: 〈101 � 0〉 // ED or 〈101 � 0〉-〈211 ���� 0〉 // ED, depending on extrusion temperature and ratio. The texture intensity increases with increasing extrusion ratio. The 〈101 � 0〉 // ED component is relatively strong in fine-grained extrusions, while the 〈211 ���� 0〉 // ED component is more obvious in coarse-grained extrusions. For all extrusions, their compressive yield strength is slightly higher than tensile yield strength, regardless of texture and grain size. This unusual tension-compression yield asymmetry is attributed to an increased value of critical stress to activate {101 � 2}〈1 � 011〉 tension twinning. Mg-4wt%Li-1wt.%Al alloy produced under similar extrusion conditions has weaker basal texture, with 〈101 � 0〉-〈211 ���� 0〉 // ED.

        <p>Effects of cold rolling and cold plane-strain compression on plasticity of thermomechanically processed Mg-4wt%Li alloy have been studied [170]. With an average grain size of 80 µm and a basal texture, this alloy exhibits remarkable room temperature formability: it can be cold rolled by 86% without fracture. In contrast, AZ31 having a similar microstructure can be cold rolled by a maximum thickness reduction of 26%, even with a small thickness reduction per cold rolling pass. The microstructure of specimen cold rolled by 86% contains a large volume fraction fine-scale shear bands that are aligned at approximately ±35° from the rolling direction RD. Under the condition of room temperature plane-strain deformation at a strain rate of 10 -4 s -1 , the alloy can be deformed by up to 1.2 strain. Examination of the microstructure of specimens deformed by 1.0 strain reveals the absence of voids and the presence of both {101 � 2} and {101 � 1} twins. It was suggested that deformation twinning is an important deformation mode. It was further suggested that the remarkable formability at room temperature is due to enhanced non-basal slip, especially the 〈c + a〉 slip mode that is promoted by the Li addition.Effects of cold rolling and cold plane-strain compression on plasticity of thermomechanically processed Mg-4wt%Li alloy have been studied [170].

For example, at the scientific level, the origin of the mysterious pyramidal plane fibre textures and their evolution with strain, strain rate and temperature in alloys containing different types and concentrations of alloying elements remains unclear; and at the technological level, room temperature formability of Mg-alloy sheet still needs to be further improved and to be combined with higher strength. Such issues will now be discussed further in the following five sections. A. Deformation and recrystallization textures A relatively wide range of textures have been observed in wrought Mg alloys. In order to reveal and highlight remaining and emerging issues associated with deformation and recrystallization textures, and more importantly, the influence of alloy composition, strain path and annealing, all the textures reported so far are analysed under the category of sheets and extrusions.Despite the significant progress that has been made on wrought Mg alloys in the past 20 years [171][172][173][174][175][176][177][178][179][180][181], there are still some unsolved and challenging scientific and technological issues on microstructure, deformation and property of this group of alloys.

        <p>Mg-alloy extrusions have more textures than Mg-alloy sheets. Extrusions of even a single alloy may have quite different textures, depending on its composition, extrusion profile and extrusion conditions. For simplicity, a cylindrical profile is used to classify the fibre textures of Mg extrusions. Similar to the texture classifications made for sheets, textures associated with cylindrical Mg-alloy extrusions can be classified into three groups: basal fibre (BF), pyramidal fibre (PyF), and prismatic fibre (PrF), Fig. 49(b).

        <p>The PyF group has two special components: Pyramidal plane // ED, and 〈101 � m〉 // ED, PyF-1 Pyramidal plane // ED, and 〈211 ���� n〉 // ED, PyF-2 where m represents 2/3, 1, or 1.5, and n represents 1, 2, or 3. Pyramidal fibre textures having a mixture of these two components, or spreading between these two components, are not listed for simplicity, even though they are frequently found in Mg extrusions. Such textures include, for example, Pyramidal plane // ED and 〈211 ���� n〉 -〈101 � m〉 // ED, where the expression of 〈211 ���� n〉 -〈101 � m〉 represents the directions lying in the pyramidal plane and spreading between 〈211 ���� n〉 and 〈101 � m〉 directions. Since the crystallographic position of the intensity maxima of poles along the ED is not clearly marked in the inverse pole figure in most studies made in the post, and the area selected for the EBSD maps is not sufficiently large in some studies, it is difficult to know precisely which one of the 〈211 ���� n〉 family forms most frequently, and which one of the 〈101 � m〉 family occurs.

        <p>In the case of extrusion textures, they appear to change significantly with extrusion parameters and alloy compositions, especially for the pyramidal fibre textures.

        <p>Considerable efforts have been made in the past 20 years on texture characterization by EBSD, and a trend of using inverse pole figure to analyse EBSD data has emerged. The use of inverse pole figure provides important clues to the type of texture in alloys produced under different strain paths or thermomechanical processing conditions. While texture types in wrought Mg alloys are relatively well established, the origin of texture weakening or change caused by some alloying additions, such as RE or combined additions of Zn, Ca and Mn, is still largely unclear. In most studies, EBSD is used to reveal the nucleation and early stages of growth of recrystallized grain. The spatial resolution of EBSD is about several-hundred nano-metres, and therefore the size of the region that this technique can analyse is well above that corresponding to nucleation stage or even early stage of growth. An associated deficiency is that EBSD alone cannot provide any information on the chemistry in that region. While it is generally accepted that recrystallized grain forms in highly strain regions, there is currently little information on the identity, distribution and concentration of solute atoms in those regions, especially the region where recrystallized grain starts to form. To reveal the origin of the texture change, the existing technique of EBSD needs to be combined with other techniques that are capable of providing texture and chemical information at much smaller scales. The emerging techniques of transmission Kikuchi diffraction (TKD) and transmission scanning electron microscopy (TSEM) [182] have a spatial resolution of tens nanometres, which an order of magnitude better than EBSD. The combined use of these diffraction and imaging techniques and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) mapping technique offers an opportunity for collecting texture and chemistry information from nano-sized recrystallized grain and its neighbouring deformed grain. An additional advantage of TSEM is its capability for in-situ straining and direct observation of dislocations, twins and stacking faults that are evolving with the straining process. With these modern techniques, it is now timely to explore the origin of the mysterious pyramidal plane fibre textures and their evolution with strain, strain rate and temperature in alloys containing different types and concentrations of alloying elements.Considerable efforts have been made in the past 20 years on texture characterization by EBSD, and a trend of using inverse pole figure to analyse EBSD data has emerged.

        <p>Dynamic recrystallization is an effective way to accommodate plastic deformation. If it could be tailored to occurs readily at room temperature, then room temperature formability of Mg sheet would be substantially improved. Currently, there are limited studies on dynamic recrystallization, even in pure Mg. Effects of alloying elements, in the form of either solute atoms, solute clusters and precipitates in solid Mg or segregation along grain boundaries, on recrystallization temperature are largely unknown. The interactions between solute/cluster/precipitate and strain carriers (dislocation and deformation twin), and that between segregated solutes and inter-granular deformation/migration mechanisms, have not been characterized in detail. The limited studies made so far indicates that solute atoms of some alloying elements may form ordered clusters [183], and may segregate strongly to, and interact strongly with, twin boundaries and tilt boundaries [3,184,185]. It has also been recognised the atoms of some added alloying elements may segregate strongly to grain boundaries, as will be discussed in the sub-section B, but the precise influence of alloying elements on texture formation and evolution seems to be largely overlooked in the past. The solute atoms segregated in grain boundaries may exert a great pinning force during boundary deformation and/or migration. Their presence also leads to reduced grain boundary energy which in turn leads to reduced tendency for migration of that section of the grain boundary.Dynamic recrystallization is an effective way to accommodate plastic deformation.

        <p>With the application of imaging and spectroscopy techniques of STEM and atom probe tomography, it is now known that atoms of some added alloying elements often segregate to grain boundary in Mg alloys. Such alloying elements include at least Gd and Y [186][187][188][189]. There are controversial results on the other alloying elements such as Al, Zn and Mn. In the work made by EDXS attached to a conventional transmission electron microscope [186], it was reported that Y atoms segregate strongly to grain boundary in hot-rolled and annealed Mg-Y binary alloys, but Zn atoms do not segregation in a Mg-Zn alloy that is produced under similar thermomechanical processing conditions. However, a recent study of extruded Mg-1wt.%Zn alloy using EDXS mapping of aberration-corrected STEM indicates clearly that Zn atoms segregate to grain boundary [85]. The segregation of Zn atoms to grain boundary is also observed in AZ31 extruded under similar conditions, Fig. 37, and in hot-rolled AZMX3110 (Mg-3Al-1Zn-1Mn-0.5Ca, wt.%) alloy [81] where the Zn segregation is revealed by atom probe tomography (APT). Another study made by EDXS-STEM of hot rolled and annealed Mg-1.1Zn and Mg-0.16Ca binary alloys and Mg-0.8Zn-0.16Ca ternary alloy (all in wt.%), also found segregation of Zn, and Ca, in grain boundaries [100]. These latest characterization results indicate that segregation of Zn atoms in grain boundary is common.With the application of imaging and spectroscopy techniques of STEM and atom probe tomography, it is now known that atoms of some added alloying elements often segregate to grain boundary in Mg alloys.

        <p>There also exist controversial reports on the segregation of Al, which is the most commonly used alloying element Al in Mg alloys. A study made recently by EDXS-STEM does not reveal any segregation of Al atoms in grain boundary, or its segregation occurs but below the detectability of the instrument, at least in AZ31 that is extruded at both low and high temperatures [85]. Another recent study made by APT indicates that Al atoms segregate to grain boundary in hot-rolled AZMX3110. It is to be noted that grain boundary segregation of Ca atoms is also found in the AZMX3110 alloy, and that Al and Ca have strong affinity.

        <p>Concerted efforts are needed in the forthcoming years in order to resolve the controversial reports and to establish the relationship between solute segregation and the type of grain boundary. Computation studies of solute segregation and its effects on boundary migration [190,191] also need to be done at the same time. It is to be noted that there are high-angle grain boundaries and low-angle grain boundaries in all wrought products, regardless of the texture type that results from a particular processing condition. If solute atoms of a given alloying element would prefer to segregate to grain boundary, then the atoms of this element would be expected to segregate to a high-energy, rather than low-energy, boundary. Under this hypothesis, some grain boundaries would contain segregated atoms of this element, while the others would not contain any. It is also natural to expect different concentrations of the segregated solute atoms in different types of grain boundaries. It is rather unfortunate that all characterization results reported so far do not provide any such informationwhether the observed solute segregation is associated with a grain boundary that is of high-angle and thus high energy. Future characterization needs to combine quantitative EDXS-STEM with electron diffraction techniques, or combine ATP with EBSD and focus-ion beam (FIB), to collect information on both grain boundary type and concentration of solutes in such boundaries. This information is critically needed for the understanding of the role of solute segregation in grain boundary deformation and grain boundary migration. C. Room temperature formability of sheet Data on Mg-alloy sheets are collected from Tables 2, 4 and 6, and they are plotted in Fig. 50 to illustrate the relationship among room temperature formability, texture, grain size and alloy yield strength. The formability is represented by Erichsen value, and texture is indicated by basal texture intensity. The use of grain size is simpler, but it may mask or overlook the potential influence of other factor that is intimately related with grain size: the distribution of grain sizes. For the banana-shaped relationship between Erichsen value and basal texture intensity, Fig. 50(a), the trend of the data indicates clearly that better formability is associated with weak basal texture intensity. Sheet with an Erichsen value above 7 always has a basal texture intensity less than 5 mrd. In general, sheets with low intensity of basal texture have higher ductility and low yield strength, Fig. 51(a,b).Concerted efforts are needed in the forthcoming years in order to resolve the controversial reports and to establish the relationship between solute segregation and the type of grain boundary.

        <p>The influence of grain size on alloy formability is less clear, as shown in Fig. 50(b). If good formability is defined as having an Erichsen value of 7 or larger, then the grain size in sheets with good formability can be as large as 50 µm, as shown by the data inside the red dashed frame in Fig. 50(b). Even if the data of Mg-Zn-Ca alloys are not considered, the grain size in sheets having good formability is still in the range 5-25 µm. For sheets having small grain sizes, even around 10 µm, the Erichsen value varies dramatically between 3 and 9. It is to be noted that small grain size usually leads to higher strength, Figs. 51(c) and 51(d), which usually makes alloy less formable. The grain size effect on alloy strength is stronger in sheet with strong basal texture, Fig. 51(c). As indicated by the banana-shaped curve in Fig. 50(c), sheets with high yield strength are usually of poor formability. At the present, there is only one alloy, based on the Mg-Al-Ca system, having a combination of good formability (&gt; 7 EI) and high strength (&gt; 200 MPa). Further development in alloy sheet needs to either enhance the strength of those having good formability (outlined by the red dashed frame), or increase the formability of those having high strength (blue dash frame).

        <p>The problem of tension-compression yield asymmetry was originally found from single crystals of pure Mg deformed under different loading conditions. It was subsequently found that this problem also exists in polycrystalline pure Mg and AZ31 that are produced by conventional thermomechanical processing in the temperature range 300-450°C. Such wrought products generally have a strong basal texture, and grains in the range 5-50 µm. Due to the presence of the basal texture, plastic deformation occurs upon compressive loading at lower stress than tension, caused by the occurrence of {101 � 2}〈1 � 011〉 twinning which cannot be activated during tensile loading. The {101 � 2}〈1 � 011〉 twinning was suggested to be grain size dependent and occur in AZ31 extrusions with average grain size above 2 µm [192]. It seems that it is for this observation, and reasoning based on it, that the tension-compression yield asymmetry has been traditionally attributed to the occurrence of {101 � 2}〈1 � 011〉 twinning that is associated with the basal texture, and attempts made in the past 20 years have been focused mainly on basal texture weakening.The problem of tension-compression yield asymmetry was originally found from single crystals of pure Mg deformed under different loading conditions.

        <p>However, it has been demonstrated in recent years that the tension-compression yield asymmetry problem can be fully eliminated even with the presence of basal texture. Notable examples include Mg-Mn-RE alloys and Mg-Li(-Al) alloys that are produced by conventional thermomechanical processing, in which the grain size is in the range 5-25 µm, and pure Mg and AZ31 extruded at lower temperatures, in which the grain size is in the order of 1 µm. It is rather unfortunate that deformation microstructures of the Mg-Mn-RE and Mg-Li(-Al) alloys have not been characterized in greater depth. It is therefore difficult to conclude whether the diminished or eliminated tension-compression yield asymmetry is associated with any difficulty involved in activating {101 � 2}〈1 � 011〉 twinning. This aspect needs more attention in any future research. Pure Mg and AZ31 have fully recrystallized microstructure when they are extruded at temperatures that are much lower than those used in conventional processing. While the grain size is typically in the order of 1 µm, they both have a strong basal texture. Analysis of microstructures of compressed samples indicates that {101 � 2}〈1 � 011〉 twinning still occurs in the AZ31, but is absent in pure Mg during the compressive plastic deformation. Again, it is currently difficult to reconcile the observations. It remains to be established whether any grain size reduction can increase the activation stress for {101 � 2}〈1 � 011〉 twinning. It is to be noted that, while pure Mg and AZ31 both have strong basal texture and grain size of ~ 1 µm, there is a strong segregation of Zn atoms in grain boundary of AZ31 in addition to the presence of Al-Mn dispersoids. Given that Zn segregation in grain boundary also occurs in coarse-grain microstructure, it is currently unclear whether the concentration of segregated Zn atoms in similar in fine-grained and coarse-grained microstructures. While it is natural to think of a lower concentration of Zn atoms in fine-grained microstructure due to the larger fraction of grain boundary, the fine-grained microstructure is usually produced by lower temperature extrusion and thus more Zn atoms may segregate to grain boundary from the solid solution matrix. This aspect requires detailed characterization using atom probe tomography or quantitative spectroscopy techniques of STEM.

        <p>Based on existing data on Mg-alloy extrusions in Tables 3, 5, 7 and 8, the relationship among tension-compression yield asymmetry, texture, grain size and tensile yield strength of alloy is plotted and shown in Fig. 52. The trend of the data seems to indicate that grain size and texture are probably equally important in the control of tension-compression yield asymmetry. With a decrease in grain size or texture intensity along the extrusion direction, the tension-compression asymmetry reduces. It is to be noted that coarse-grained extrusions always have tension-compression asymmetry, and that extrusions with higher texture intensity can have similar yield strength in tension and compression, Figs. 52(a) and 52(b).

        <p>There is a trend in recent years to develop alloys with leaner compositions and lower-cost processes. The use of a dilute concentration in the alloy allows wrought Mg product to be more readily processed, either by rolling or by extrusion. It has been demonstrated that sheets made of dilute alloys can exhibit excellent formability at room temperature, together with good combination of strength and ductility [83,108,115]. The sheet strength obtained is generally adequate, but higher strength would be needed for wider applications. One approach to this issue is to further reduce the grain size by optimizing thermomechanical processing parameters. It is to be noted that ultra-fine grains (~ 1 µm or less) have been achieved in Mg extrusion alloys, and even in pure Mg, and that these ultra-fine-grained extrusions exhibit higher strength and good ductility. However, it is currently difficult to produce sheet with a microstructure containing a uniform distribution of recrystallized grains of ~ 1 µm or less in dilute alloys. An alternative approach is to design dilute alloys that are age hardenable after the forming process. One example is a dilute Mg-Al-Ca-Mn-Zn sheet alloy that has good room temperature formability and age hardenability post forming process [82].There is a trend in recent years to develop alloys with leaner compositions and lower-cost processes.

        <p>At the processing level, there are some approaches to higher-speed extrusion and higher-speed rolling, with the aim to reducing the processing cost by increasing production rate [87,88,166]. In general, higher-speed extrusion leads to coarser grains than those obtained from lower speeds. The balance between production rate and alloy properties is still far from being optimized, and a considerable effort is still needed in this area. Higher-speed rolling allows larger thickness reduction per pass than lower speed, at a given temperature. The increased level of strain and strain rate may offer an opportunity to explore the potential of achieving higher nucleation rate of recrystallization and thus finer grains. Again, this is an area that needs some attention in future research. VI.

The WB-1 or WB-2 component is often associated with alloying additions of RE elements or combined addition of Zn and Ca elements, but the weakening effect depends critically on the processing conditions. Room temperature sheet formability of most alloys is influenced mainly by texture; weakened basal texture leads to better formability. However, Mg-Li based binary and ternary alloys with a strong basal texture can exhibit remarkable formability at room temperature. (6) Textures associated with cylindrical extrusions of pure Mg and its alloys can be classified into three groups: basal fibre (BF), pyramidal fibre (PyF), and prismatic fibre (PrF).

This texture forms occasionally in Elektron 675 and Mg-Mn-RE alloys that are extruded under some particular conditions. Tension-compression yield asymmetry of extrusions is influenced by both texture and grain size: it diminishes with weakened texture, or reduced grain size, or both. Tension-compression yield asymmetry may fully disappear in pure Mg and Mg alloys when the grain size is in the order of one micron. (7) The origin of texture weakening or change is still not fully understood. The final texture of an alloy is determined by the following factors: (i) the initial texture and quality of the as-processed alloy, for example, casting condition and cooling rate; (ii) the deformation texture of the alloy resulting from various processing conditions, including thermomechanical processing methods (rolling, extrusion, and forging), processing temperature, strain rate, and strain, and (iii) the recrystallization texture obtained during processing and/or after subsequent heat treatment. The addition of alloying elements affects texture of the alloy in every step described above. In Mg and its alloys, the evolution of deformation texture is much more complicated than those in face-centered cubic and body-centered cubic metals, because of various possible slip and twinning modes. The added alloying elements and their quantities changes CRSS and flow stresses of various deformation modes in different ways and their relative ratios, which will certainly change the activities of various slip/twinning modes during deformation, and as a result, affect the final deformation texture. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the effect of alloying addition on the ratio of CRSS and relative activities of different deformation modes. Unfortunately, our understanding in this area is very limited at the moment. Further study is crucial to understand the origin of texture weakening or change. Solute segregation to grain boundaries can also occur, but it has not been well characterized. The experimental reports on solute segregation are still controversial. When solute atoms of a given alloying element segregate to grain boundary, it remains to be established whether the atoms of this element would segregate only to high-energy, rather than low-energy, part of a boundary. (8) There is an emerging trend of developing dilute alloys for higher speed extrusion and higher speed rolling. Strengthening of such dilute alloys can be achieved by obtaining ultra-fine grains or generating nano-scale precipitates via post-extrusion/rolling ageing.

The final texture of an alloy is determined by the following factors: (i) the initial texture and quality of the as-processed alloy, for example, casting condition and cooling rate; (ii) the deformation texture of the alloy resulting from various processing conditions, including thermomechanical processing methods (rolling, extrusion, and forging), processing temperature, strain rate, and strain, and (iii) the recrystallization texture obtained during processing and/or after subsequent heat treatment. The addition of alloying elements affects texture of the alloy in every step described above. In Mg and its alloys, the evolution of deformation texture is much more complicated than those in face-centered cubic and body-centered cubic metals, because of various possible slip and twinning modes. The added alloying elements and their quantities changes CRSS and flow stresses of various deformation modes in different ways and their relative ratios, which will certainly change the activities of various slip/twinning modes during deformation, and as a result, affect the final deformation texture. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the effect of alloying addition on the ratio of CRSS and relative activities of different deformation modes. Unfortunately, our understanding in this area is very limited at the moment. Further study is crucial to understand the origin of texture weakening or change. Solute segregation to grain boundaries can also occur, but it has not been well characterized. The experimental reports on solute segregation are still controversial. When solute atoms of a given alloying element segregate to grain boundary, it remains to be established whether the atoms of this element would segregate only to high-energy, rather than low-energy, part of a boundary. (8) There is an emerging trend of developing dilute alloys for higher speed extrusion and higher speed rolling. Strengthening of such dilute alloys can be achieved by obtaining ultra-fine grains or generating nano-scale precipitates via post-extrusion/rolling ageing.
