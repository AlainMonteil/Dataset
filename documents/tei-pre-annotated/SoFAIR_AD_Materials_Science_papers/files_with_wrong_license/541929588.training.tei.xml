        <p>Polyoxidovanadates (POVs, previously named polyoxovanadates) are a subgroup of polyoxidometalates (POMs, previously named polyoxometalates) with interesting pharmacological actions that have been tested as potential antidiabetic, antibacterial, antiprotozoal, antiviral, and anticancer drugs. They contain mainly vanadium and are able to interact with proteins, affecting various biological processes. The most studied POV is the isopolyoxidovanadate decavanadate (V 10 ), which interacts with proteins and/or enzymes such as tyrosine protein phosphatases, P-type ATPases, RNA triphosphatases, myosin and actin. However, in many POVs-protein systems, the binding sites and/or the residues involved in the interaction are not identified. In the present review, the interactions of POVs, as well as linear trivanadate (V 3 ), both linear and cyclic tetravanadate (V 4 ) and two proposed heptavanadate (V 7 ; which are better described by V 10 molecules), with proteins are described through X-ray crystallographic studies. Interactions with POVs through theoretical and spectroscopic studies of proteins related to muscle contraction, serum, oxidative stress, and diabetes were also discussed. In sum, herein, we describe POVs' interactions with various proteins including acid phosphatase A, receptor tyrosine kinase, ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (NTPDases), transient receptor potential cation channel (TRPM4), phosphoglucomutases, P-type ATPases, myosin, actin, transferrin, albumin, and glucosidases, among others. The putative POVs' effects on proteins are impacted by the POV' stability and speciation. The modes of POVs' interactions include H-bond, electrostatic, H-bond + electrostatic, van der Waals, and covalent binding. The spectroscopic, X-ray and computational results, the sites and modes of binding are described in detail.</p>
        <p>In the last 30 years, the number of studies of polyoxidometalates (POMs, previously named polyoxometalates) and polyoxidovanadates (POVs, previously named polyoxovanadates) associated with enzymatic inhibition [1][2][3][4][5] and diseases, including insulin enhancement agents [6][7][8][9] for diabetes mellitus, and inhibitors of the aggregation of amyloid b-peptides associated with Alzheimer's disease have clearly increased [10,11]. The growing interest in POMs and POVs is extending their applications to diverse areas of basic and applied sciences [12][13][14][15][16][17][18] with several studies about various aspects and applications of POVs published covering chemical engineering [19] catalysis [20], environmental chemistry [21], material science [18], biochemistry, biology, pharmacology, and medicine [5,13,14,[22][23][24].</p>
        <p>POVs' structures have widespread sizes and shapes and may include other hetero-ions such as P V and As V (Fig. 1). The addenda metal oxidoions M=O generally contain M = W VI , Mo VI , and/or V V and other transition metal ions such as Co II , and/or Mn II . The structures are described in excellent reviews on chemistry of these POV compounds [12,23,25,26].</p>
        <p>In the present review, we describe recent studies on the interaction of polyoxidovanadates with proteins, depending on the diversity and nature of the particular POV, and their potential implications in biological processes as well as in biomedical applications. In order to understand such an interaction, information on the stability and speciation under physiological conditions are necessary. In some studies, the protein interactions with other oxidovanadates, such as monomeric (V 1 , Fig. 1A), dimeric (V 2 , Fig. 1B), trimeric (V 3 ) and tetrameric (V 4 , Fig. 1C,D) vanadates, as well as other POVs were investigated [27]. The effects of vanadium coordination complexes are not the focus of this review, and the reader is referred to other sources for such information [28][29][30][31][32].</p>
        <p>Considering the structural complexity of POVs, their stabilities are variable and it is important to determine what species exist in solution together with the proteins. Hence, it is desired that the stability of the species is investigated under the assay conditions, as recently reviewed [5,33,34].</p>
        <p>Decavanadate, [V 10 O 28 ] 6-(V 10 , Fig. 1H), is an isopolyoxidovanadate that has been described in detail and serves to showcase the relevance of POVs' speciation and stability to deduce its biological effects [34,35]. Decavanadate has an oblong, compact structure with dimensions of 8.3 Â 7.7 Â 5.4 Å [36][37][38]. By 51 spectroscopy, three different vanadium ion environments can be distinguished in the V 10 structure. The yellow or bright orange color of V 10 solutions can be detected at 360 and 400 nm by UV/ Vis spectroscopy [34,39] and the V 10 stability can be followed by this technique, even for mM concentrations [39,40]. Once formed, V 10 was shown to be persisting in solution even in the neutral and basic pH range where V 10 is expected to be no longer thermodynamically stable [34,35]; kinetic reasons can explain this behavior. At acidic pH values, from pH 2 to 6, it is the most stable oxidovanadate. The speciation profile is shown in Fig. 2, illustrating that V 10 has several protonation states with all the pK a values falling in the range from pH 2 to 6.</p>
        <p>The acidic orange decavanadate solutions can be hydrolyzed by either heating or boiling the neutral or alkaline solutions into the colorless monomeric and oligomeric vanadates [34,41,42]. 51 V NMR spectroscopy can be used to monitor the speciation of V 10 in enzyme assays or in growth media and experiments can be designed to evaluate specific interactions with proteins [5,34,39,40,43,44]. For V 10, as well as for other POVs, particularly those that are labile such as V 2 and V 4 , respectively, it is possible by combining kinetic with spectroscopic studies to analyze their stability, recognize their specific protein interactions, and determine the specific POV species' contribution to the observed biolog-ical effects [34,35,[45][46][47][48]. In contrast to the labile oxidovanadates, the half-life of decavanadate is much greater and in serum is 15 h Fig. 1. Oxidovanadates and polyoxidovanadate structures with the nuclearity up to 14 addenda atoms and both tetrahedral and octahedral coordination of V. Tri-and tetravanadates are presented in two forms -cyclic ({V 3c }, C and {V 4c }, E) and linear ({V 3l }, D and {V 4l }, F). The linear forms of {V 3l } and {V 4l } have never been obtained in solid state. In the {MnV 13 } structure, K, four equatorial V atoms have 75 % occupancy [27] and so in total correspond to three V ions with full occupancy in the sum formula. Color code: {VO x }, grey; O, red; P, yellow; Mn, pink. The subscript ''c" stands for ''cyclic", ''l" for ''linear".

Aqueous solution species distribution of V(V) as a function of pH at 0.200 M. The stability constants of the inorganic vanadates were taken from [41]. Decavanadate (V 10 ) species are shown in red. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) at ambient temperature [39], whereas in buffered media at 25 °C and 37 °C, the half-life decreases to 12 h and 3 h, respectively [39,49]. When V 10 was applied to media with growth additives for mycobacteria, the half-life reduces even further to a few hours [50]. Metal-based compounds are subject to speciation chemistry [51], which depend on buffers itself and all the other components in the solution, emphasizing the need to confirm the stability of V 10 under the assay conditions [34,35,39,49,52,53].</p>
        <p>The kinetics of the decomposition of sodium and metforminium decavanadate were determined in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, CaCl 2 , 0.2 g/L; KCl, 0.4 g/L; NaCl, 6.4 g/L; Na 2 -HPO 4 , 0.109 g/L; Na 2 CO 3 , 3.7 g/L; glucose, 1 g/L, and 20 proteinogenic amino acids) at pH 7.4 and 25 °C [54]. In these systems, the results showed that the half-life time of [H 2 VO 4 ] -(V 1 , Fig. 1A) and other smaller oxidovanadates species such as 1E) and [V 5 O 15 ] 5-(V 5 ) were 9 and 11 h for sodium and metforminium salts, consistent with earlier reports in other growth media and differences in lifetime based on counterion, temperature and, most importantly, pH [55][56][57].</p>
        <p>Although speciation studies consider all the contributions of components in solution, the effects of proteins are usually neglected [39,53]. The presence of macromolecules can significantly affect, and in some cases increase, the stability of V 10 . In 2006, it was described that, at pH 7.4, the decavanadate's halflife increases 5.5-fold in the presence of the monomeric form of actin (G-actin) [39], while the addition of Mycobacterium smegmatis or Mycobacterium tuberculosis cells to a V 10 solution between pH 5.8 and 6.8 causes immediate decomposition of the decavanadate [50]. Changes in its hydrolytic stability caused by the addition of G-actin is in contrast to the stability of POVs in pure water and illustrate one more time the potential change in the POV's stability through addition of biomolecules [39,50]. Similarly, studies with V 10 as a phosphatase inhibitor have shown that the enzymes may facilitate hydrolysis [58]. V 10 is stable for weeks in pure aqueous at pH 4.0 and no change in the hydrolysis rate is observed [59].</p>
        <p>In the present review we focus on POVs' interactions with proteins, which complements previous reviews on the binding of general vanadium compounds [60,61], polyoxidomolybdates-or polyoxidotungstate-protein binding [1,3,15] and updates previous reviews on V 10 and other POVs [5,34]. The interactions of POV (summarized in Tables 1 and2, starting from 1989 for Table 1) with protein can be grouped into: i) Coordinative or covalent interaction of an amino acid sidechain to V(V). This unusual binding type is represented by binding of ß-alanine to {V 6 O 24 } [62]. The possibility that this type of bonding does exist is supported by the observation that the presence of V 10 caused oxidation of Cys374 in F-actin and one of the protein core cysteine residues in G-actin, presumably Cys272 [63,64] (see below in section 3.2). Oxidation of the protein supports a putative POV bond to the protein or intermolecular electron transfer.</p>
        <p>ii) Non-covalent binding, more common than the covalent one, when the interaction occurs through secondary interactions, namely van der Waals (vdW) contacts and hydrogen bonds (Hbonds). This binding mode depends on several factors, such as the electric charge that influences the electrostatic interactions, the shape and volume size that determine the host-guest complementary, and the formation of H-bonds with the terminal oxygens [65,66]. Other variables are pH and ionic strength. The H-bonds are often directed or mediated by H 2 O molecules [67]. The majority of the possible binding modes of V 10 in proteins as well as a summary of the non-covalent interacting amino acids are given in Fig. 3.</p>
        <p>Distinguishing coordinative from non-covalent bond and determining their strength is not a trivial task and computational methods are often necessary [68,69]. On the framework of non-covalent binding, several docking software programs offer the opportunity to examine metal-protein interactions [70][71][72][73]. In most of the cases, reproducing experimental results requires adjusting the weights of intramolecular and intermolecular H-bonds and vdW Acid phosphatase (human prostate)</p>

The coordinative binding can be described with pure electrostatic functions [70][71][72] or through covalent docking approaches nowadays implemented in packages such as 
            <rs type="software">GOLD</rs> [75] or 
            <rs type="software">Autodock</rs> [71] and source code modifications such as Cova-lentDock [76] or Docktite [77]. In these cases, the metal-protein bond needs to be defined a priori and restrained during docking.
        </p>
        <p>A recently updated version of the GoldScore scoring function of the GOLD program was successfully validated for a large series of metal complexes demonstrating its capability to predict coordination bonds without any geometrical constraint or energy restraint [78,79].</p>
        <p>A report in 1973 introduced V 10 as a microMolar inhibitor of rabbit muscle adenylate kinase [80]. These studies were followed by several papers discussing a number of other glycolytic enzymes including fructohexokinase, and phosphofructokinase, among others, all inhibited by V 10 [5,[81][82][83]. These inhibition studies were complemented early on through 51 V NMR studies by Csermely et al. in 1985 [84], reporting that the addition of Ca 2+ -ATPase from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to a solution of both labile oxidovanadates and V 10 would result in 51 V NMR spectra in which V 10 signals selectively disappeared. These results are consistent with the binding of Ca 2+ -ATPase to the V 10 over the simple monooxidovanadates (Fig. 1) [85]. The effects of V 10 in the structure and function of the Ca 2+ -ATPase were further explored [85,86]. Thus, it was found that only V 10 species, and not the V 1 species, were able to inhibit calcium accumulation coupled with ATP hydrolysis [85], as well as proton ejection [86] by the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ -ATPase, clearly affecting energy transduction processes [85][86][87].</p>
        <p>Analysis of the speciation in aqueous solution accompanied the enzyme studies [34,35,46,[83][84][85][86][87][88][89][90][91], and in the case of 6phosphogluconate dehydrogenase all the observed inhibition could Fig. 3.

        <p>be attributed to the V 4c (Fig. 1E) species [45]. Subsequent kinetic studies confirmed inhibition with corresponding tetranuclear molybdate and ruled out inhibition with the pentanuclear molybdate [88]. Several additional studies with glycolytic enzymes including Leuconostoc mesenteroidex glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and muscle fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase illustrated that V 4c was an inhibitor, although partial inhibition may have been contributed by a weaker inhibiting V 2 . The enzyme source can affect the selectivity as illustrated in the case of the Leishmania acid phosphatase where both V 10 and simple monomeric vanadate V 1 were considered to be the inhibitors [2,58], whereas for the human prostatic phosphatase both V 1 and V 2 were inhibitors. These two reports are contrary to most other phosphatases that are inhibited potently by V 1 [93][94][95][96]. Besides the ones described above, several studies of the interaction/effects of POVs with proteins/enzymes have been reported since 1989, using kinetic and spectroscopic methods and are summarized in Table 1. Some of the milestones for POVs' interactions with proteins and enzymes are highlighted in a chronological order in Fig. 4.</p>
        <p>3.1. X-ray crystallographic studies of POVs with proteins 3.1.1. Overview of V-protein and POV-protein complexes A search of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [111,112] on the structures determined by X-ray crystallography using the terms «vanadium», «vanadate», «vanadyl» and «proteins» gives over 150 structures as shown in Fig. 5. This is about 40 structures more than reported in 2015 when an analysis of V-phosphatases complexes was reported [93][94][95][96] and a testimony to the increased interest of V-protein interaction. However, only four structures contain V 10 , with a fifth structure when cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) as a technique is used (lined bars, Fig. 5) and a sixth structure where the electron density of the V 10 is not complete. These six structures include an acid phosphatase, a tyrosine kinase, two ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (NTPDases), a human transient receptor potential cation channel (TRPM4) and a human cell cycle protein CksHs1 [96,111,[113][114][115][116]. In addition, a few other structures exist containing other POVs (angled bars, Fig. 5), including V 2 (Fig. 1B), V 3l (Fig. 1D), V 4c (Fig. 1E), and the unusual heptaoxidovanadate (V 7 ) and are summarized in Table 2.</p>
        <p>The remaining vanadium-containing protein X-ray structures in the PDB display only one vanadium ion and, although most contain orthovanadate (Fig. 1A) or other protonation states collectively called V 1 , some other forms do exist such as V 2 and/or V 4 . We first describe the six V 10 -protein complexes and then the protein adducts with other smaller oxidovanadates including the two species with the binding of V 7 [113,117].</p>
        <p>The proteins bind V 1 mainly as tetrahedral and trigonal bipyramidal vanadium oxidoanions; the latter mimic the trigonal bipyramidal transition states of phosphoryl transfer reactions [93,94,96,118]. A few structures in which the binding of the vanadium to a ligand associated with a protein have been reported, along with structures showing the binding of V 10 or other POVs to the putative active site of the proteins, mimicking the binding of vanadate in place of its endogenous substrate. Specifically, in 2006 the first interaction of V 10 with the enzyme phosphatase was crystallographically characterized [114]. The enzyme was a respiratory burst-inhibiting acid phosphatase from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Category A bio-terrorism agent Francisella tularensis. The enzyme is a prototype of a super-family of acid phosphatases and phospholipases C, which was known to be inhibited by vanadate. The phosphatase in question has a serine in the active site as well as a metal ion, but, in contrast to most known phosphatases [93,94], binds V 10 on the surface [114] and after it V 1 in its active site.</p>
        <p>A 2006 publication describes the Francisella tularensis Acid phosphatase A (AcPA) as a prototype of a unique superfamily of acid phosphatases and phospholipases C [114]. The phosphatase has in the active site a serine residue interacting with the metal ion through a coordinative bond and hence a mechanism that deviates from other phosphatases. In the PDB there is also a structure of Francisella tularensis AcPA obtained by crystallization at pH 6.0 bound to V 10 (PDB code 2D1G) shown in Fig. 6 [114]. This form of the crystal is not described in the publication [114], but the structure is uploaded into the PDB. AcPA is a phosphatase that binds V 1 , but V 10 was observed to also bind to the protein when the enzyme was incubated with vanadate added to the solution in the form of sodium orthovanadate (Na 3 VO 4 ), which converted to V 10 under the crystallization conditions (pH = 6) [114]. Interestingly, the crystallized protein that binds V 10 also contains V 1 coordinated in the active site. The larger V 10 anion is interacting loosely with a group of positively charged amino acids at the surface of the protein. The phosphatase interacts with the V 10 through several Hbonds resulting in isolation of the V 10 -protein complex (Fig. 6B). As shown in Fig. 6B, a lysine residue is found to cap the loosely bound V 10 .</p>
        <p>The interaction of V 10 to the respiratory burst-inhibiting acid phosphatase was not expected because V 1 is clearly the form of vanadate that is known to inhibit other phosphatases [94,93]. However, the inhibition of alkaline phosphatase by V 10 has also been reported [58]. The inhibition of this phosphatase was different than that observed by V 1 alone, even if the behavior cannot be related to the presence of V 10 only. In fact, although V 10 was stable under the conditions of the enzyme assay, some minor hydrolysis of the V 10 was observed [58]. These observations are consistent with the protein causing the partial hydrolysis of V 10 to V 1 . This latter reaction has been observed for the growth inhibition of Mycobacterium smegmatus and Mycobacteria tuberculosis where speciation studies showed in both that V 10 was hydrolyzed more rapidly in media containing the bacteria [44]. Furthermore, growth inhibition of these bacteria was observed by the presence of V 10 much more potently than by V 1 [44] or similarly by monosubstituted V 10 derivatives such as V 9 Pt and V 9 Mo [50].</p>
        <p>A second acid phosphatase with a {VO 4 N} coordination environment is also reported in the PDB (PDB code 4QIH), but has not yet been reported in the literature [115] and, hence, provides little additional insights into the binding of the phosphatase-V systems, but a POV appears to be bound to it. In addition, the human prostatic acid phosphatase was previously reported to be inhibited not only by V 1 but also by the V 2 ; the former at neutral and basic pH and the latter at acidic pH values (Table 1) [48]. These reports support the interpretation that X-ray data show different oxidovanadates interactions with the prostatic acid phosphatase, depending on the experimental conditions [93,94].</p>
        <p>Nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1 (NTPDase1) is an ectonucleotidase that catalyze the hydrolysis of cand bphosphate residues of triphospho-and diphosphonucleosides [116]. By hydrolyzing proinflammatory ATP and plateletactivating ADP to AMP, it blocks platelet aggregation and supports blood flow. NTPDase1 hydrolyzes P2 receptors (P2Y and P2X), such as ATP, ADP, UTP and UDP, with similar efficacy. Investigating the structure and dynamics of this representative member of the eukaryotic NTPDase family was done using a variant of soluble NTPDase1 (PDB codes 4BRH, 3ZX2 and 3GQI for activated receptor) lacking a putative membrane interaction loop between the two lobes of the catalytic domain, as reported by Zebisch et al. [119]. Notably, V 10 was formed under the experimental conditions from orthovanadate. The complex structure of NTPDase1 (PDB code 3ZX2) shows that V 10 binds electrostatically to a highly positively charged loop that is involved in binding of the nucleobase. The crystal structure shows four independent copies of the protein, each of them bound to V 10 interacting with the same interfacial active site cleft of the enzyme that contains several lysine groups.</p>
        <p>As shown in Fig. 7A, the lysine network in the protein interacts through H-bonds with two of the V 10 faces bringing the two parts of the protein together. Binding on multiple faces of the V 10 is also observed in the crystal structure of NTPDase1 that bound both thiamine-phosphovanadate and V 10 (PDB code 4BRH) [120]. V 10 interacts both with the lysine residues and the NTP unit (Fig. 7B), organizing two parts of the protein around the V 10 molecule. V 10 also binds to an activated receptor tyrosine kinase in one known crystal structure (PDB code 3GQI), shown in Fig. 8 [121]. Although kinases are complementary enzymes to phosphatases which interact strongly with vanadium salts, surprisingly few examples have been reported exhibiting any direct interaction of kinases with vanadate or POVs. The cAMP protein kinase that is removing phosphate groups from peptide substrates and assayed using the Kemptide substrate (Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly) was inhibited by V 10 [91]. The mechanistic studies demonstrated that the competitive inhibition was caused by the Kemptide binding to the V 10 anion and not V 10 binding to the kinase. However, this report proves a rare and strong affinity for a peptide-V 10 complex which is significantly stronger than the H-bonds observed in the V 10 -dipeptide (Gly-Gly) complex that is crystallographically characterized [38]. Interaction of the activated receptor tyrosine kinase with V 10 (PDB code 3GQI) is therefore of great interest [121]. The receptor tyrosine kinase is a subclass of tyrosine kinases and not only a representative of kinases, but a protein involved in mediating cell-to-cell communication and controlling a wide range of complex biological functions, including cell growth, motility, dif-ferentiation, and metabolism [122]. V 10 was previously reported to initiate signaling on another tyrosine kinase receptor, the Type I Fce receptor [108,123]. This receptor initiates intracellular signaling cascades ultimately leading to degranulation, the release of histamine, from cytoplasmic vesicles, as a key event leading to physical symptoms associated with an allergic response.</p>
        <p>In the crystal structure of the activated receptor tyrosine kinase (PDB code 3GQI) the V 10 moiety is found at a turn on the protein surface and at the interface between PLCc and FGFR1-3p protein domains [121]. The protein peptides are organized/wrapped around the V 10 anion (Fig. 8). The authors reported the crystallization in a tris-buffered solution (pH 8.0) containing the protein, where Na 3 VO 4 was added. However, the V 10 anion was localized using idealized V 10 coordinates placed where high electron density was present in the difference map. The buffered alkaline conditions of the crystallization would not normally favor formation of V 10 , however in the deposited structure the authors assigned the observed density as V 10 and optimized the geometry to fit. The V 10 is found in close contact with a positively charged patch at the interface between FGFR1-3p and PLCc chains (Fig. 8A) [121]. Upon closer examination, the V 10 anion is H-bonding with two adjacent amino acid side chains, namely Asn506 and Arg507, the binding is further supported by Lys504 (Fig. 8B) interacting with a different V 10 surface part than observed with the apo-NTPDase1, NTPDase1 and thiamine-phosphovanadate shown in Fig. 7; i.e. the protein is interacting with the end of the oblong anisotropic V 10 anion rather than the side of the V 10 . Given the difference in binding directionality and the use of idealized coordinates, it is possible that the cluster is actually a number of disordered smaller oxidovanadate ions that are known to form at pH 8 [41,124]. The small number of available protein complexes with V 10 makes it difficult to label this motif as an outlier. Such interpretation is especially difficult given the similarity in interactions between activated receptor tyrosine kinase (PDB code 3GQI) and the acid phosphatase structure (PDB code 2D1G) shown in Fig. 6. Although protein binding can stabilize V 10 at higher pH values [39] and some counterions have been found to significantly change fundamental properties of V 10 [125], we point to the unlikely formation of V 10 at pH 8, and the existence of an attractive interpretation that the electron density in the protein complex reported in ref. [121] can be attributed to one or more of the smaller rapidly equilibrating oxidovanadates.</p>
        <p>Transient receptor potential channel (TRP) is a Ca 2+ -activated, non-selective cation channel that is permeable to Na + and K + and is found to depolarize the cell [126]. This process can be modulated by V 10 . It is one of the eight melastatin-like transient receptor potential (TRPM) subfamily of TRP channels. TRPM family members are characteristically assembled with N-terminal TRPM homology regions (MHRs) and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain. This depolarizing modulation of cellular Ca 2+ entry is important for cellular responses such as neuronal bursting activity, cardiac rhythm and the immune response. The The cryo-EM structure was determined for the most widespread Ca 2+ -activated, non-selective (CAN) channel, human TRPM4, bound to both the agonist Ca 2+ and the modulating V 10 (PDB code 5WP6). The V 10 was formed from a solution of 50 mM Na 3 VO 4 adjusted to pH 2.0 from which 1 mM V 10 and 5 mM calcium chloride was mixed with purified TRPM4 for a few hours before cryo-EM experiment. The cryo-EM structure of a human TRPM4 channel shown in Fig. 9A consists of a protein complex with Ca 2+ and several V 10 [126]. The Ca 2+ ions are necessary for formation of the crystals although the density for the Ca 2+ was not discernible, the patch-clamp recorded data showed Ca 2+ activation that can be blocked by either flufenamic acid or ATP 4À consistent with the Ca 2+ being agonist and associated with the active site. The global view of TRPM4 in Fig. 9A shows eight V 10 moieties, four for each surface and internal characterized binding mode. Enlarged views of the two unique V 10 0 s binding modes are shown in Fig. 9B and Fig. 9C and show the high density of positively-charged residues surrounding each V 10 . The V 10 at the surface sites are characterized by the interaction of four Arg, two Ser, two Lys and one Gln side chain (Fig. 9B). The internally stabilized V 10 is supported by three Arg, one Ser and one His side chain (Fig. 9C).</p>
        <p>The crystal structure of the human cell cycle protein CksHs1 with kinase domain was shown to bind V 7 species, see Fig. 10 (PDB code 1DKT). However, as the authors described in the manuscript, they believed that the V-cluster in the protein was a V 10 cluster with three disordered vanadates [113]. This protein is involved in cell-cycle progression, which is largely regulated up or down by the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) [127]. The Cdks act by phosphorylation and several Cdks have cell-cycle functions in eukaryotic species. Two human gene homologs, CksHs1 and CksHs2, have been cloned and found to functionally substitute for CKS1 in S. cerevisiae [128]. Both phosphate and vanadate bound to CksHs1 provided information on CksHs1-ligand interactions. The vanadate binds tightly to Cks and was successfully used for crystallizing CksHs1 [113]. Two phosphate-binding sites are located near the dimer interface within a crevice formed by the dimer association (Fig. 10).</p>
        <p>CksHs1 crystallizes as a dimer with phosphate, tungstate [113] or vanadate. However, since vanadate oligomerizes and forms V 10 in aqueous solution at acidic pH and V 10 interacts with an activated receptor tyrosine kinase, it is possible that a cluster would be asso-Fig. 8.

The authors noted a large positive region of electron density in their model, indeed larger than what is predictable for a mononuclear and even simple oligomeric species, which the authors presumed to be ''metavanadate" given their crystallization conditions. As seen in the structure shown in Fig. 10, the observed electron density was modeled with seven V-atoms as a V 7 . Because V 7 is not commonly observed in aqueous solution [41], the presence of a V 7 in a protein complex would represent the report of a new oxidovanadate species. Therefore, we considered the possibility that the V 7 structure would be more accurately described as another POV, as described below.</p>
        <p>In this highly symmetric (D 3 ) structure, a region of high electron density sits along the symmetry axis and this was formulated as {V 7 O 19 } in the deposition for 1DKT in the PDB [113]. Unfortunately, distances between V and O centers and atom arrangements leading to the suggested coordination geometries are inconsistent with the formulation of a V 7 structure. One possible interpretation, sug-gested by the authors, is that this POV is more likely to be V 10 anion for which all the V-atoms are not fully occupied in the crystal structure. This interpretation is supported by the fact that the symmetry does not allow an asymmetric non-branching V 7 as formulated in the deposited structure and thus casting serious doubt on the interpretation of a novel V 7 species. Unlike in entry 3GQI [121], where the authors chose to use idealized coordinates and parameters to model the V 10 in the structure, in the 1DKT it was assumed that the actual species is V 10 with some electron density missing. The missing electron density has likely been modeled as solvent water and thus the authors labeled the rest of the V 10 molecule as a V 7 moiety to rationalize the diffraction data. In summary, this report does not support a new V 7 -protein complex, but an imperfect V 10 -protein adduct missing some of the electron density needed to account for a complete V 10 anion.</p>
        <p>An alternative interpretation considers that the 1DKT structure, like 2D1G [114], contains more than one binding site for oxi-Fig. 9.

(For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) dovanadates and, as such, could contain smaller species bound in addition to the postulated V 7 /V 10 . The smaller species bind in a shallow surface groove in positions occupied by phosphates in the corresponding phosphate-containing crystal structure. The V 7 /V 10 species appears to form hydrogen bonds with Lys, two Arg, and a backbone nitrogen of Ser in the modeling. Given the presence of smaller oxidovanadates in the structure, it is possible that the alternative interpretation of the V 7 is representing at least in part a mixture of smaller, disordered bound oxidovanadates with average electron density corresponding to a V 7 .</p>
        <p>Although only six proteins were found to bind V 10 , from the protein descriptions above some common patterns do emerge. There are fundamentally two types of binding sites: i) surface binding, where V 10 binds non-specifically to the surface of the protein; and ii) internal binding, where V 10 binds within a specific pocket into the three-dimensional structure of the protein. In several cases of surface binding, the V 10 is bound to the protein along with a simple vanadate, V 1 . In each of these cases the V 10 binding involves positive ''patches" of the protein; the negatively charged POVs electrostatically interact with multiple positively charged side chains. In the larger V 10 , there are more of these weak electrostatic interactions than in the case of V 1 , making the surface binding relatively stronger. In two of the cases, although they are still relatively close to the protein surface, the side chains of the protein's amino acids wrap around the V 10 anion, somehow creating a specific solvent excluded pocket. In these internal binding cases, the anion is associated more specifically and solidifies the interactions between the protein and the large V 10 . In the following section, we will describe interactions with smaller POV anions.</p>
        <p>In addition to V 10 , there are several smaller POVs including V 2 , V 3 , V 4 (Fig. 1) and a V 7 that have been reported to form complexes with various proteins and have been investigated by X-ray diffraction methods. One of the first characterized structures of vanadate oligomers bound to proteins was the E. coli co-factor dependent phosphoglycerate mutase (dPGM) and the structure with a linear V 4 (Fig. 1F) bound has been determined at a 1.3 Å resolution, PDB code 1E59 [129] (Fig. 11A).</p>
        <p>The dPGM enzyme is a structural homolog of rat prostatic acid phosphatase from Rattus norvegicus and catalyzes the reaction of 3phosphoglycerate (3-PG) to form 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PG). The mechanism goes through the phosphoryl transfer to form 2,3bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) and a dephosphorylated dPGM intermediate. This X-ray structural determination of dPGM shows a linear V 4 bound in the active site [129] (Fig. 11B). This structure remains the only reported case of binding of the linear tetrameric POV to a protein. The studies with vanadate provided insight into the mechanism of this reaction.</p>
        <p>In neutral solutions, a cyclic tetrameric oxidovanadate [V 4 O 12 ] 4- (Fig. 1E) is stable, while a linear oxidovanadate [V 4 O 13 ] 6-(Fig. 1F) has been reported up to pH 9.0 [130]. The authors, reporting the V 4 -dPGM structure, characterize the binding site of dPGM as basic, which is consistent with the interaction and stabilization of the linear oxidovanadate over the cyclic V 4 generally stable in aqueous solution, and observed in structures with PDB codes 1UZI and 1L7V [131,132] (Fig. 12). The structure of the V 4 -dPGM shows the two internal V-atoms (V 2 and V 3 ) well defined by the electron densities, whereas the two terminal V-atoms are disordered and modelled with only half occupancy. Thus, the structure may be a disordered V 2 or V 3 which are present in aqueous solution [130] and which have been observed in 1H2F, Fig. 13 [133], and 3F9B [134], where POVs bind to Bacillus stearothermophilus phosphatase PhoE and Yersinia protein-tyrosine phosphatase YopH, respectively. The highly charged binding site of dPGM forms a strong V-protein complex replacing the sulfate binding. This protein hence illustrates the versatility of the interactions of oxidovanadates with enzymes formed from solutions containing different V-species including V-Tris adducts (aqueous solutions of vanadate in Tris and other buffers will form V-buffer complexes as described previously in detail [51,135,136], however additional complexes in a crystallization medium may be important to generate the envi- ronment that allows a particular crystal to form). The linear V 4 is bound to dPGM in place of the four sulfate groups found in native dPGM structures, stabilized by an elaborate H-bond network, although the two internal V-atoms or sulfate groups are held tighter than the two terminal groups, Fig. 11B. The two reported structures containing cyclic V 4 -protein interactions are those of the C3 exoenzyme for Clostridium botulinum, (C3bot1, PDB code 1UZI), Fig. 12A [131], and E. coli BtuCD protein (PDB code 1L7V), Fig. 12B [132]. In C3bot1, the cyclic V 4 interacts loosely with the exoenzyme displaying contacts with asparagine side chains and the protein backbone (Fig. 12A). The binding site is found between biological assemblies holding together adjacent symmetry-equivalent domains. It is interesting that vanadate (V 1 ) similarly serves to bring together adjacent symmetryequivalent domains at both ends of the assembly. Vanadate here thus serves as electrostatic ''glue" to hold together the adjacent symmetry-equivalent domains. Similarly, the holding together of adjacent biological domains has been observed for other anisotropic POMs including the tellurium-centered Anderson polyoxidotungstate (TEW, [TeW 6 O 24 ] 6-), which is now used as an effective technique to promote protein crystallization [137][138][139][140][141].</p>
        <p>In the E. coli BtuCD protein, an ABC transporter involved in B12 uptake [132], the cyclic V 4 unit has more interactions than in C3bot1 as shown in Fig. 12B. Specifically, contacts with a threonine side chain and a long interaction with a glutamine from a neighboring chain are formed, but most are with protein backbone in a helical portion of the structure.</p>
        <p>The complex of V 3 with Bacillus stearothermophilus phosphatase (PhoE) [133], a member of the cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase superfamily, has been characterized by X-ray crystallography (PDB code 1H2F) [133]. The V 3 is coordinated both to catalytic residues His10 and Glu83 that are part of an elaborate H-bonding network (Fig. 13). The V 3 -PhoE complex was prepared through soaking of the PhoE-phosphate crystals prepared in 30.0% ethylene glycol, 25.0 mM AMP, and 55.0 mM sodium cacodylate buffer at pH 4.5 to which a solution of 50 mM NH 4 VO 3 , 30% ethylene glycol, 20 mM sodium acetate at pH 5.0 was added [133]. Because this mixture is incubated for three days, it is likely that the solution under those conditions contains V 10 (Fig. 2), as well as a previously characterized complex with ethylene glycol [142], and yet the crystal formed containing the less stable V 3 anion, perhaps because of the size constraints of the binding site. The image in Fig. 13 shows that V 3 replaces the phosphate, forming an extensive H-bonding network in the V 3 -PhoE complex. Hence the V 3 -PhoE adduct is significantly different than the dPGM structure containing V 4 [129], where V 4 was found to form a strong complex replacing the four sulfate groups present in the native enzyme (Fig. 11). The association of V 3 with the PhoE protein is the only reported case so far involving V 3 , with its unique availability of apoenzyme, product affinity, and phosphorylated intermediate structures. It seems likely that similar affinities will apply to other dPGM superfamily members. Indeed, modeling with adding V 3 into E. coli uridine phosphorylase was carried out and provided mechanistic details of this enzyme [117]. These observations are important because active, non-phosphorylated dPGM and inactive F26BPase structures as well as several other potential members of this superfamily of proteins have been identified in pathogenic organisms such as Streptococci, Listeria, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus anthracis [134]. A heptamer (V 7 ) was indicated in a deposited structure of E. coli uridine phosphorylase, PDB code 1RXS [117]. As mentioned above for the human cell cycle protein CksHs1 with PDB code 1DKT, a V 7 would represent a new species and was considered in detail by Arvai et al. [113] and now by us in preparation of this manuscript. Both Arvai et al. and us assigned the observed cluster to a V 10 with missing electron density, even if Arvai et al. deposited the coordinates for the V 7 in PDB with code 1DKT. In the case of the structure of E. coli uridine phosphorylase, with PDB code 1RXS, electron density of a V-cluster assigned by Caradoc-Davies et al. [117] to the V 7 anion is found, even if no discussion was provided in the publication other than vanadate was used in the crystallization and for the solution of the structure. Given that the V 7 in 1DKT was just an electron density model, not an actual proposal of a structure, we favor an interpretation for the vanadium species to be something other than V 7 . However, since there are not enough details provided by Caradoc-Davies et al. [117], we cannot deduce whether this structure contains one or more of the smaller oxidovanadates or a V 10 .</p>
        <p>In addition to the V 3 , V 4 , and V 7 POV interactions with proteins, a few reports have described V 2 -protein adducts [94]. The systems range from simply pyrophosphate analogs to a diamond core complex associated with the vanadium. One very interesting case is one of the vanadate-Yersinia phosphatases structures (PDB code 3F9B) [134], where the dimer that is associated with the structure contains vanadium with two different coordination geometries [134]. The vanadium associated with the protein has a fivecoordinate trigonal bipyramidal geometry whereas the free, terminal vanadium is four-coordinate and tetrahedral and is exemplary of the influence the protein can have on the coordination environment of oxidometalates [94].</p>
        <p>In this section, we have discussed the binding of POVs described as a V 2 , V 3 , V 4 , and a putative V 7 . These former three structures show a greater diversity than those reported for the binding of V 10 , whereas the reports with V 7 are likely a result of a decomposed or disordered POV or an incomplete electron density. In all these studies, complementarity between protein and POVs is high for crystals to form and in some cases so high that even less-stable POVs can give rise to tight V-protein adducts.</p>
        <p>According to Tables 1 and2, V 10 interacts with several proteins including those involved in the mechanism and regulation of muscle contraction -myosin, actin and Ca 2+ -ATPase [39,49,56]. It is common for V 10 to interact with ATP binding proteins, but it also interacts and inhibits other enzymes such as membrane channels and RNA ribonucleases (Tables 1 and2). Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium pump has proven to be an excellent model to study toxicology effects of POVs on P-type ATPases, such as the Na + ,K + -ATPase and Ca 2+ -ATPase. These ion pumps are involved in essential ions homeostasis, such as Na + , K + and Ca 2+ , therefore regulating several key cellular processes. Although Table 1 represents only data since 1989, it has been known since 1982 that V 10 interacts with SR Ca 2+ -ATPase [84,143]. Thus, V 10 has a higher inhibition capacity compared to V 1 alone and different abilities to induce changes in the structure and function of the enzyme, as described, for instance, for myosin, actin and calcium pump [39,49,56,99,144]. Recently, another POV, Cs 5.6 H 3.4 PV 14 O 42 Á12H 2 O (PV 14 , Fig. 1I), was described to inhibit P-type ATPases, being particularly more potent than V 10 (IC 50 = 15 mM) in the inhibition of the Ca 2+ -ATPase (IC 50 = 0.6 mM) [57].</p>
        <p>Regarding of actomyosin ATPase inhibition by V 10 , the first studies were described in 1988, using flow microcalorimetry [145]. In 2004 [49], it was reported that such an inhibition implies a myosin binding site different from ATP site, and that V 10 inhibi-tion is non-competitive. These studies clearly demonstrated that, unlike V 1 , V 10 species can strongly inhibit the myosin actinstimulated ATPase activity with an IC 50 of 6.1 mM for V 10, whereas no inhibitory effects were detected for V 1 up to 150 mM [49]. It was proposed, combining molecular docking simulations with kinetic studies, that V 10 interacts with the phosphate-binding domains in the vicinity of the designated ''back-door" binding site (Fig. 14) [49,104]. Thus, an intermediate myosinÁMgATPÁV 10 complex is formed, which inhibits the myosin-actin interactions associated with ATP hydrolysis by actomyosin, and the blocking of the muscle contraction process most likely occurs in a prehydrolysis state [49,99,104]. Note that the walker A motif (corresponding to the P-loop in myosin), as well as the ABC (ATPbinding cassette) ATPases, were also described as an anionbinding domain that can interact with this POV with high affinity [92,104].</p>
        <p>In contrast to the examples described above, for a long time there was no available information on the molecular interaction of V 10 with actin, another major protein of the contractile system of muscle cells. The first report describing the interaction between V 10 and actin was published in 2006, suggested that G-actin, the globular monomeric form of actin, stabilizes decavanadate species by increasing the half-life time of decomposition from 5 to 27 h [39]. V 10 inhibits the rate of G-actin polymerization into F-actin (polymerized form of actin), with an IC 50 of 17 mM [39], suggesting that it would affect cytoskeleton structures responsible for many processes of relevant biological significance. These studies were further explored and described protein cysteine oxidation together with vanadate reduction upon V 10 incubation with actin [63]. Additionally, it was also shown that V 10 binding induces an opening of the G-actin cleft. V 10 was able to oxidize Cys374 in F-actin and one of the protein core cysteine residues, presumably Cys272 [63,64]. In fact, the interaction of V 10 with G-actin results in a vanadate(V) reduction to oxidovanadium(IV) ion. Moreover, in the presence of ATP in the medium assay, the reduction of V V to V IV is prevented and all five G-actin cysteine residues remain in their reduced form [63,109].</p>
        <p>In 2021, molecular dynamics and docking studies were described in order to attain an understanding at molecular level of the V 10 -G-actin interaction, rationalizing the results obtained during the last 15 years by several spectroscopic techniques [64].</p>
        <p>Four binding sites of V 10 were identified, named a, b, c, and d, the site a being the catalytic nucleotide site located in the cleft of the enzyme at the interface of the subdomains II and IV. The site a is stabilized by H-bonds with Gln59, Arg62, Tyr69, Thr204, Arg207, and Arg211 residues. The site a is more stable than site b by more than 20 kcalÁmol À1 and much more for sites c and d [64].</p>
        <p>A slight opening of the nucleotide binding site a is predicted after the interaction with V 10 which varies the cleft opening (defined as the C(a) Lys67 -C(a) Val339 -C(a) Thr203 angle) from 28.6°in the apo form to 35.6°in the adduct with V 10 , with a rearrangement of the H-bonds. The behavior of V 10 was compared with the bulkier isostructural polyoxidoniobate (PONb) Nb 10 (volume of 594.3 Å 3 vs. 520.6 Å 3 of V 10 ) which is more stable at the site b [64].</p>
        <p>ATP is found at the site a, the enzymatic cleft of G-actin, and this ATP binding is more favorable by 14.1 kcal mol À1 than V 10 . MD studies indicated that the presence of ATP hinders the V 10 binding, which is forced to reach the site b. Notably, the competition is less important for Nb 10 because this POM shows a higher affinity for site b than for site a, suggesting that both POVs and PONbs could contemporaneously bind to G-actin, making their action synergistic, a finding that should be possible for other POMs-protein systems (Fig. 15) [64].</p>
        <p>Finally, in the study mentioned above, it was demonstrated that the binding mode of V IV O 2+ ion, formed upon the V 10 reduction by Cys residues, is in the catalytic site a with (His161, Asp154) coor-dination; interestingly, this adduct overlaps significantly with the region where ATP is bound, accounting for the competition between V 10 and V IV O 2+ with ATP, observed by EPR spectroscopy [64].</p>
        <p>After the administration of a POV, it may or may not reach the bloodstream intact, depending on the mode of administration [146]. The interaction of a POV with serum proteins is most likely to occur with intravenous administration or if the compound easily penetrates the cells membranes required to reach the blood, where POV would be associated with the serum fraction. In serum, a POV encounters several biomolecules and, in particular, proteins like human serum transferrin (HTf) and human serum albumin (HSA). Transferrins are a group of single-chain glycoproteins having 700 amino acids with a mass of ca. 80 kDa with a concentration in blood around 30 mM [147,148]. In human serum, HTf transports not only iron [149], but also other metal ions such as Bi, Al, Ru, Mn, Ni, and V in its three oxidation states stable in biological systems (+III, +IV, +V) [61,150]. Considering the iron amount in the two specific sites in the N-and C-terminal, the concentration of available sites for metal binding is ca. 34 mM [151]. HSA is the most abundant blood protein with a concentration around 640 mM [148] and transports, beside essential and toxic metal ions and their compounds [152], fatty acids and endogenous and exogenous ligands [153].</p>
        <p>It was recently described that V 10 interacts both with HSA and HTf, presumably through non-covalent binding (see section 3.1), but surprisingly (2-hepH) 2 [{Co(H 2 O) 5 } 2 V 10 O 28 ]Á4H 2 O (V 10 Co, 2-hepH = 2-hydroxyethylpyridinium) exhibits high affinity toward transferrin but does not interact with albumin [43]. It was supposed that the Co II centers coordinated to {VO} groups of V 10 occupy the binding sites of V 10 , blocking its interaction with the albumin protein [43]. In contrast, HTf shows interaction with V 10 Co, but the reasons for this different behavior should be examined in detail at an experimental and computational level. The different behavior of V 10 Co was also shown by two model pro- teins: in proteinase K, V 10 Co interacts more strongly than thaumatin [43].</p>
        <p>According to the WHO, about 400 million individuals worldwide have diabetes, which can cause heart disease, stroke, kidney damage, and even death [154]. Insulin, which is produced by bcells found in pancreatic islets, regulates the metabolism of carbohydrates. In 2021, it will be 100 years since insulin was discovered by Banting, Best and McLeod at the University of Toronto [28,155,156]. Vanadium has also long been associated with diabetes; in 1899, French scientists reported the blood glucoselowering effect of vanadium [157]. However, it was only by 1979 that it was shown that vanadium salts exhibit insulin-enhancing effects, leading to a growing interest in vanadium compounds for the treatment of diabetes [158][159][160]. Since then, insulin-like effect of various vanadium compounds, mainly oxidovanadium(IV) sulfate and organic vanadates have been described [146]. One organic vanadium compound, bis(ethylmaltolato)oxidovanadium(IV), entered Phase I and II clinical trials [156]. However, vanadium coordination complexes are not the purpose of the present review, and the interested reader should address that elsewhere [158,161,162]. Therefore, the antidiabetic potential of POVs and vanadium-substituted POMs is described here.</p>
        <p>Certain polyoxidometalates are known to have insulinenhancing properties [163]. Also, some POVs, for instance V 10 , have been shown to enhance glucose uptake in rat adipocytes [7]. Moreover, a hybrid decavanadate compound namely metformin (Metf) decavanadate, (H 2 Metf) 3 V 10 , showed hypoglycemic and lipidlowering effects in animal models of both insulin-dependent (type 1) and insulin-independent diabetes (type 2) [8] beyond those observed with metformin itself. The insulin-mimetic effect of benzylamine-decavanadate (C 7 H 10 N) 6 V 10 was also studied [9]. As with (H 2 Metf) 3 [V 10 O 28 ], (C 7 H 10 N) 6 V 10 stimulated glucose transport and normalized the lipid profile. Also recently, a second compound, [DMAPH] 4 (NH 4 ) 2 V 10 (DMAPH = 4-dimethylaminopyridinium), showed hypoglycemic and lipid-lowering effects [164].</p>
        <p>The exact POVs mechanism remains unknown for both type 1 and 2 diabetes. However, the POVs insulin-enhancer effect might, among others, derive from V 10 inhibition of protein tyrosinase phosphatase, an enzyme catalyzing the dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor, which turns off insulin signaling. It was also suggested that (H 2 Metf) 3 V 10 interferes with the mitochondrial electron transport chain, forcing lipid oxidation. In fact, V 10 was previously described to target mitochondria strongly affecting oxygen consumption and mitochondria membrane depolarization [106], and to induce necrotic death in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes through mitochondrial membrane depolarization [165]. More recently, it was referred that a mixed POM containing vanadium, K 11 H[(VO) 3 (SbW9O 33 ) 2 ], which exerts hypoglycemic effects in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, shows hepatic protective properties and stimulation of insulin synthesis [166]. These findings clearly show that V-containing POMs are not only insulinenhancers, as suggested before for other vanadium compounds, but also stimulate the insulin synthesis [146,167].</p>
        <p>Besides hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, oxidative stress contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetes. Recently, the oxidative stress in multiple tissues of alloxan-induced diabetic rats (type 1 diabetes) and the effect of (H 2 Metf) 3 V 10 on this stress was evaluated [168]. It was described that (H 2 Metf) 3 V 10 reduced oxidative stress by positively affecting the nuclear factor erythroid 2related factor 2 (NRF2), a transcription factor responsible for cellular antioxidants. Thus, POVs mediated activation of NRF2 induces the expression of reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT), restoring cellular antioxidants defenses.</p>
        <p>POVs inhibition of a-glucosidase, which converts carbohydrates into glucose, is another strategy for the treatment of diabetes. About 10 mixed polyoxidomolybdates (POMos) containing vana- Coordination Chemistry Reviews 454 (2022) 214344 [170,173]. For H 6 [PMo 9 V 3 O 40 ] the mixed type of inhibition was described, and the structure predicted from docking studies is shown in Fig. 16.</p>
        <p>As referred in the above section, the mode of action of POVs in diabetes might be due to, inter alia, direct or indirect changes in cellular oxidative responses. However, owing to the low stability of V 10 under physiological conditions, it is expected that it dissociates into minor oxidovanadates namely V 1 , V 2 and V 4 , presumably involved in the biological effects observed. The detoxification mechanism proposed for vanadate involves bioreduction of vanadate to oxidovanadium(IV) by glutathione (GSH) [174]. Therefore, GSH is an important cellular antioxidant defense system and directly or indirectly regulates the levels of ROS [175,176]. On the other hand, in Fenton-like reactions vanadate is reduced to V IV -O 2+ with production of OH . [177,178]. However, vanadium prooxidants effects are not the purpose of the review and the reader is referred elsewhere [146,167]. Since the beginning of the 21 century, the Aureliano research group has been performing POVs in vivo studies, mainly with V 10 , in order to determine the contribution of V 10 species to toxic effects observed in fish at room tem-perature where V 10 stability is higher [40,55,179,180]. Following V 10 in vivo administration, several oxidative stress parameters were ascertained in fish: reduced GSH content, overall rate of ROS production, lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant enzyme activities [40,55,179,180]. It was concluded that V 10 clearly induces different and, in many times, opposite effects than the ones observed for vanadate [181,182]. For instance, upon V 10 exposure, an increase in GSH content and ROS production was observed, as well as a decrease in mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes activities such as SOD and catalase activities, whereas opposite or no effects were observed for vanadate [40,55]. Therefore, it was suggested that POVs species exposure follows different pathways than vanadate for the generation of reactive oxygen species and that they interfere differently with some of the enzymes involved in antioxidant defenses in cells [182,183].</p>
        <p>In summary, studies describing POVs, mainly V 10 interactions with proteins (Fig. 17) include, among others: 1) proteins associated with diabetes such as phosphatases, tyrosine kinases and glucosidases; 2) membrane channels such as TRPM4 channels, ATP sensitive channels, porin VDAC modulator and P2X receptor; 3) muscle contraction proteins such as myosin and actin; 4) serum proteins, such as albumin and transferrin; 5) P-type ATPases such as Ca 2+ -ATPase pumps; 6) mitochondria proteins such as complex Fig. 17. Scheme of the described interactions of proteins with POVs such as V 2 , V 4, and V 10 . POVs' interactions include muscle contraction proteins, channels, receptors and ion pumps, mitochondria proteins, nucleus proteins, serum proteins as well as those associated with diabetes, among others. III and 7) nucleus proteins, such as RNA triphosphatase and DNAbinding protein. Smaller POV proteins interactions include, among others: 8) phosphoglucomutases; C3 exoenzymes; cell cycle proteins and phosphorylases (Fig. 17).</p>
        <p>In summary, we have described from a qualitative and quantitative point of view information about the interaction of several POVs, particularly V 10 , with several key cellular proteins including phosphatases, NTPDases, TRPM4 channel, tyrosine kinases, myosin actin, transferrin, albumin and glucosidases, among others. Considering the methods available to determine speciation and mode of actions, this subgroup of POMs is likely to receive much more interest in the near future as probes for enzymes and in biomedical applications. The application of POVs, being pure, POVs-based hybrids and/or nanomaterials containing POVs in various biological systems, is a rapidly growing branch of science.</p>
        <p>The understanding of the POVs interactions with proteins remains the key step for elucidating the biomedical mechanism of action of these compounds, and in this review, we examined both the molecular interactions through reported POV-protein structures from X-ray crystallographic reports as well as studies characterizing these interactions using computational methods. In spite of the fact that simple vanadate salts are often used for the experimental treatment, the POVs can form under the conditions of the studies. In the reported cases, POVs seem to exert their cellular effects by interacting with the numerous proteins in the respiratory chain and the cytoskeleton, with the ionic transport systems, as well as with DNA, among others, and the molecular interactions are affecting structure and function.</p>
        <p>Besides hydrogen bonds, electrostatic and van der Waals interactions contribute to POVs binding to proteins. The X-ray structures of V 10 -proteins show that there are two groups of POVprotein interactions, those located at the surface or at the interior of the proteins. In both cases, the binding sites are characterized by complementary interactions of a positive patch on the protein surface where the V 10 will form several H-bonds and electrostatic salt bridges. The positively charged residues include a variety of Lys, Arg, and His and in an organized manner complementary surrounding the V 10 anion, strengthening the surface interaction. Of particular interest is the V 10 myosin back-door interaction and also its reduction by actin that is prevented by the native ligand MgATP. In spite the low stability of POVs at physiological pH, the half-life of V 10 is increased in serum, suggesting an interaction with proteins that can stabilize its structure. Some proteins, such as actin, improve 6-fold the stability of V 10 .</p>
        <p>Examples of less common POVs forming V-protein adducts were also summarized. These systems are very interesting in that these include interactions of vanadate with kinases, signaling molecules and phosphoglucomutases and phosphoglyceratemutases and the formation of V 2 -protein, V 3 -protein, V 4 -protein, as well as V 1 -protein adducts was demonstrated. However, there are two reported V 7 -protein complexes, whose electronic density is often diffuse and does not lead to clear solutions. In one case the study was exhaustive and showed that the system is not likely to involve a new V 7 POV, but the results instead are better explained by V 10 or a combination of smaller oxidovanadates.</p>
        <p>A couple of POVs is actually binding the less stable linear V 3 and linear V 4 , which are not observed in aqueous solution at pH 7. Interestingly, in these cases the POV-proteins interactions are sufficiently stable and the result is the formation of complexes between proteins and uncommon and less stable POVs present only in small amounts from the crystallization media. The reported V-protein complexes must bind the V-cluster very tightly and be stabilized by both primary and secondary non-covalent interactions.</p>
        <p>POVs, especially modified V 10 , showed promising antidiabetic effects in animal models of type 1 and 2 diabetes. However, other activities have recently been reported including antimicrobial activities. V 10 and Pt and Mo mono-substituted V 10 were found to inhibit growth of Mycobacteria smegmatis and/or Mycobacteria tuberculosis. Furthermore, the POVs were reported to initiate signaling and, in this case, it was not only V 10 but also multivalent V 14 and V 15 POVs that were active.</p>
        <p>In summary, this review demonstrates the quantity and quality of information now available characterizing the POVs' interaction with proteins and enzymes. Studies reported have used a range of methods to determine speciation and mode of actions. Undoubtedly, the POV subgroup of POMs is likely to receive much more interest in the near future given their ability to serve as probes for enzymes and their direct effects in biomedical applications. With so few POV-protein structures reported and the known ability of POMs to assist in crystallization, it is very likely that the number of reported POV-protein structures will increase. Moreover, we also predict that the future will show that a number of different hetero-POVs will be biologically active. Such an approach will allow for obtaining not only clusters with mixed metal ions in addition to vanadium atoms, but also multivalent POVs, i.e. containing both V IV and V V . As was illustrated in a few available studies, the structural framework from the vanadium will be maintained but substitutions will allow for more diverse redox chemistry and biological activities. The future is indeed bright for POVs.</p>
