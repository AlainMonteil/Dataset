        <p>Upscalable fabrication of efficient and stable perovskite solar modules is urgently needed for commercialization. Herein, we introduce methylammonium chloride (MACl) additives in the cosolvent system of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) / N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) to control the formation of intermediate phases during the growth of formamidinium (FA)-cesium (Cs) lead triiodide perovskite films. We achieve high quality films upon drying without the use of antisolvent.</p>
        <p>By implementing bulk and surface passivation, the champion efficiencies of 24.02% for a smallsized solar cell and 20.5% for a 5 cm × 5 cm solar mini-module on an aperture area of 22.4 cm 2 (geometrical fill factor is ~96%) are achieved by spin-coating. The fully blade-coated perovskite 2 solar sub-module demonstrates a champion efficiency of 15.3% on an aperture area of 205 cm 2 . The solar mini-module exhibits impressive operational stability with a T80 lifetime over 1000 hours at maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under continuous light illumination.</p>
        <p>Owing to the outstanding optoelectronic properties of hybrid organic-inorganic metal halide perovskite materials such as high absorption coefficient, long carrier diffusion length, and low trap density, over 25% power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have been achieved for small-sized perovskite solar cells (PSCs) [1][2][3] . However, the realization of large-scale, high-efficiency and stable perovskite solar modules (PSMs) still faces a number of technological hurdles for the widespread commercial application at present [4][5][6][7] . It has been proposed that the major issues are due to a lack of control when upscaling the manufacturing process, such as the homogeneity of perovskite composition and morphology which affect the reproducibility and long-term stability of the PSMs 7,8 .</p>
        <p>Recently, an increasing number of research works have been devoted to improving both the PCE and stability of perovskite solar mini-modules from the viewpoints of scalable deposition engineering 4,9 , perovskite compositions [10][11][12] , electron/hole transport materials as well as the corresponding interfaces [13][14][15][16][17] . Undoubtedly, the scalable fabrication of a large-area high-quality perovskite light absorber layer remains elusive. To achieve highly efficient and stable PSMs, typical three-dimensional (3D) formamidinium (FA, NH2CH=NH2 + )-based lead triiodide perovskite has become the widely studied composition due to its narrower bandgap (Eg) and better thermal stability compared to the methylammonium (MA, CH3NH3 + )-based counterparts [18][19][20] . A lot of strategies, such as solid-reaction by chemical vapor deposition 21 , one-step and two-step solution processes such as slot-die coating, inkjet printing, and spray coating [22][23][24][25][26] , have also been employed to upscale largearea high-quality FA-based perovskite films. Among them, one-step solution printing techniques such as blade coating and slot-die coating are promising methods with low cost and convenience in scalable fabrication 27 , which also demonstrated impressive efficiencies for perovskite solar minimodules by combining with proper additive engineering 9,10, 23 . For example, Huang and coworkers reported a blade coated FA-based perovskite solar mini-module with PCE over 19% on an aperture area of 50 cm 2 by introducing a solid-state lead coordinating additive of carbohydrazide (CBH) to modify the interfacial properties between the perovskite and substrate 28 . Seok and coworkers also reported a bar coated FA-based perovskite solar mini-module with an efficiency of 20.4% on an aperture area of 31 cm 2 via additive engineering of n-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone (CHP) for improving the morphology of the perovskite layer 29 . However, the investigation on printing perovskite solar sub-modules with an area larger than 200 cm 2 is still lacking. How to upscale highquality large-scale perovskite films and assemble them into sub-modules with a minimum PCE penalty are still challenging at present, which is also an essential step towards panel-scale solar cells.</p>
        <p>If the compact perovskite film can be formed just from the self-drying condition (Self-drying herein means that the solvent of the perovskite precursor ink volatilizes naturally at room temperature without assistance of any other process such as heating, spinning, blowing, etc), the upscaling printing process will be easier and more efficient (i.e., more convenient, lower cost, and higher reproducibility). Based on this rationale, it is essential to develop a suitable perovskite precursor ink for growing high-quality perovskite films for large-scale sub-modules. In our previous study, we provided a lead halide-templated crystallization process for printing large-area FA-based perovskite films, to minimize the formation of undesirable perovskite-DMF complex intermediates that could induce dendritic crystals 24,30 . The competition between the lead halide-NMP adducts and the perovskite-DMF complex intermediates dominates the morphology and crystallinity of the final FA-based perovskite films. The presence of an ample amount of CsI (17%) and lead chloride (PbCl2) helps to improve the morphology, suppress the δ-phase formation and stabilize the final α-phase perovskite film [31][32][33] , however, it enlarges the bandgap and thus lowers the efficiency of eventual solar modules. The introduction of a proper amount of MACl additives is another widely used strategy for improving the morphology and stabilizing the α-phase of FA-based perovskite within the one-step or two-step methods [34][35][36] . However, the effect of MACl additives on nucleation and growth of self-drying perovskite films is not fully understood, which is essential information to overcome the challenges in improving the quality of large-area films.</p>
        <p>In this work, we report a modulation strategy of self-drying FA-Cs perovskite precursor ink for scalable fabrication of large-scale perovskite solar sub-modules. Fig. 1a presents the configuration of the perovskite solar sub-module with the scalable deposition strategy of each functional layer. A proper amount of MACl additives is introduced into a narrower bandgap (~1.55 eV) FA0.88Cs0.12PbI3 perovskite-NMP/DMF precursor ink to realize the scalable printing of high-quality perovskite layers.</p>
        <p>In our initial exploration, we found that the lower formation energy of FA-Cs-alloyed perovskites would contribute to the growth of high-quality α-phase films (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Note 1). Due to the lower formation energy through the incorporation of MACl in the FAPbI3 perovskite crystal structure 34 , we propose that the undesirable FA-based perovskite-DMF complex intermediates, which originally transform into δ-phase perovskites, can be directly converted to α-phase perovskite intermediates with the addition of MACl. From the in situ XRD studies, we inferred the corresponding nucleation and growth behaviors with the further introduction of MACl as illustrated in Fig. 1b. In addition, the MACl can also induce higher orientation growth of perovskite crystals, resulting in high-quality perovskite films. By further passivating defects around the crystals by excess PbI2 and forming two-dimensional (2D) perovskite with the longchain ligands on the three-dimensional (3D) perovskite surface, a champion efficiency of 24.02% is achieved on small-sized PSCs. With precise control of geometrical fill factor (~96%) for solar modules, the corresponding 5 cm × 5 cm solar mini-module demonstrates high efficiency of 20.5% on an aperture area of 22.4 cm 2 , corresponding to an active area efficiency of 21.4% and a total area efficiency of 18.4% on a 25.0 cm 2 substrate. More importantly, this strategy can be also translated to even larger scales by scalable printing, enabling a fully blade coated 15 cm × 15 cm solar submodule with high efficiency of 15.3% on an aperture area of 205 cm 2 .</p>
        <p>We firstly optimized the nucleation and growth processes of the narrower bandgap perovskite material, FA0.88Cs0.12PbI3, for satisfying the commercial scaling-up printing process. However, at low concentrations of Cs, the intrinsic properties such as formation energy, morphology, and especially the crystallization process would be significantly changed as presented in Supplementary Fig 1 . Even by further introduction of 10% molar ratio PbCl2 into the perovskite precursor as described in our previous work 24 , it is still not enough to eliminate the pinholes in the FA0.88Cs0.12PbI3 perovskite film even after anti-solvent-free spin-coating (Supplementary Fig. 2).</p>
        <p>To gain further knowledge, the pure FA0.88Cs0.12PbI3 perovskite film was self-dried on the FTO substrate from the NMP/DMF co-solvent system at room temperature. We observed a poor morphology with a lot of rectangular bulk clusters stacking on top of one another (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 3), which was induced by the formation of stronger FA2Pb3I8•4DMF intermediates than the PbI2•NMP adducts, as demonstrated in the in situ XRD results (Fig. 2b).</p>
        <p>Therefore, the strong competitiveness of the DMF solvent-coordinated perovskite complex intermediates during the nucleation process contributes to the poor morphology of the final perovskite films.</p>
        <p>To further suppress the perovskite-DMF complex intermediates, instead of introducing excessive PbCl2 (Supplementary Fig. 2), we find that they can be completely suppressed by the introduction of MACl, and most of which leaves the perovskite film eventually and does not substantially enlarge the optical bandgap of perovskite 34 . By introducing the MACl with a molar ratio of 0.3 to the stoichiometric perovskite precursor, more nuclei form with smaller cluster size as shown in Fig. 2c.</p>
        <p>The FA2Pb3I8•4DMF intermediates that would originally transform to δ-phase are completely suppressed based on the in situ XRD study (Fig. 2d). More interestingly, the α-phase perovskite directly forms and becomes predominant at the expense of the δ-phase during solvent evaporation.</p>
        <p>Even without the assistance of NMP, which helps lower the free energy 24,37 , the α-phase perovskite also forms in the pure DMF system with the addition of MACl additives (Supplementary Fig. 4).</p>
        <p>This fast formation of α-phase perovskite can be ascribed to the lower formation energy by the incorporation of MACl as demonstrated from the theoretical calculation results (Fig. 2e, Supplementary Fig. 5), which confirms that MACl has been preferentially incorporated into the FAPbI3 perovskite crystal structure than the majority of CsI during the initial crystallization process and thus stabilizes the formation of α-phase (black phase) firstly. Therefore, the undesirable growth of FA2Pb3I8•4DMF intermediates from the pristine precursor ink can be directly converted into the α-phase perovskite intermediates with the addition of MACl, as depicted in the schematic Fig. 1b, which improves the competitiveness of PbI2•NMP adducts and suppresses the undesirable δ-phase formation, contributing to a denser morphology. As a result, a much denser film can be obtained after self-drying at room temperature as shown in the SEM images (Fig. 2f).</p>
        <p>Thermal annealing at different temperatures is employed to observe the crystal growth and corresponding morphology changes. Fig. 2f shows the SEM images of the self-dried films with MACl additives after thermal annealing at different temperatures. As the temperature increases, smaller grains fuse into one larger grain and the holes disappear, while simultaneously the solvent and MACl (or their byproducts) are volatilized, as confirmed by the mass spectroscopy analysis (Supplementary Fig. 6), which suggest that the overall mechanism is consistent with a typical Ostwald ripening process, as depicted in Fig. 3a. A pinhole-free compact perovskite film with micro-sized grains and high crystallinity is readily obtained after thermal annealing at 150 ℃, however, a further increase in temperature would lead to the rapid decomposition of perovskite into PbI2 due to the volatilization of FA (Supplementary Fig. 7a-b). In sharp contrast, without MACl additives, the perovskite film shows small size grains and conspicuous pinholes (Supplementary Fig. 3b). This indicates that the introduction of MACl can induce the formation of a compact film easily from the self-drying precursor ink after ripening.</p>
        <p>To reduce the surface roughness caused by the non-uniform solvent evaporation under self-drying, we find that a simple spin-coating process is suitable to deposit a smoother and denser film with much smaller nuclei. Furthermore, a highly orientated perovskite film with compact morphology and smooth surface is easily achieved by this MACl induced Ostwald ripening process, while the pristine counterpart (without MACl) from the anti-solvent free spin-coating still presents poor crystallinity and obvious pinholes even after thermal annealing (Fig. 3b-c, Supplementary Fig. 11).</p>
        <p>To further understand the crystal growth behavior during the Ostwald ripening process with MACl additives, the XRD characterization was conducted for the spin-coated films after thermal annealing at different temperatures as shown in Supplementary Fig. 7. A new diffraction peak appeared at 9.3° under low-temperature annealing, which is possibly a mixed MACl and Cs-based new phase perovskite as demonstrated by the XRD results (Supplementary Fig. 8). Then, this peak disappeared when the temperature was over 75 ℃ due to the volatilization of MACl as confirmed by the mass spectroscopy results (Supplementary Fig. 6), leading to a blend structure of Cs and FA-based perovskite after the removal of MACl, and subsequently generating the FA-Cs-mixed cations-based perovskite films. Therefore, the crystallization process can be described by the two paths as shown in Supplementary Fig. 9. One path forms the stable PbI2-NMP adducts, and the other path which would originally form the perovskite-DMF complex intermediates is directly converted into α-phase (MAFACs)Pb(ICl)3 perovskite intermediates with the insertion of MACl.</p>
        <p>With the further volatilization of NMP during the ripening process, some of the released PbI2 can react with the residual FAI, CsI and MACl to form this new intermediate phase and α-phase (MAFACs)Pb(ICl)3 perovskite intermediates under low temperature. Finally, the mixed cationsbased perovskite (FA0.88Cs0.12PbI3) structure forms due to the release of MACl under higher temperature ripening, which suppresses the δ-phase formation during the whole growth process.</p>
        <p>More importantly, this MACl induced cation and anion exchange during the crystallization process not only improves the morphology but also stabilizes the α-phase FA-Cs perovskite films.</p>
        <p>Even without thermal annealing, the nuclei formed in the MACl-added films continue to grow into larger size polygonal grains with micron size (Supplementary Fig. 10). The results also demonstrated the formation of a stable α-phase and no δ-phase even after 60 min in the ambient environment (temperature ~25 ℃, relative humidity ~50%), while the films without MACl still remain small crystals and are converted to δ-phase directly (Supplementary Fig. 10). Therefore, this growth strategy is potentially suitable for the scalable fabrication of large-size perovskite films in an ambient environment.</p>
        <p>To further improve the quality of perovskite films, we employ a simple passivation strategy for the grain boundaries, by introducing proper excess PbI2 (5% molar ratio) in the precursor ink according to previous reports 38 , and post-treatment with organic salts (dodecylamine hydrobromide, DABr) to passivate both the boundaries and surface of the grains, respectively. The corresponding crystallinity and morphology changes are shown in Fig. 3b-f and Supplementary Fig. 11. The solubility of MACl in the stoichiometric perovskite (FA0.88Cs0.12PbI3) precursor solution can be also improved by the reaction with the introduced excess PbI2, which avoids the formation of flocculent precipitates with Cs precursors (Supplementary Fig. 12). The post-treatment of DABr will form a 2D layer perovskite by the reaction with the introduced excess PbI2 or cations exchange due to the isopropanol (IPA) solvent that can slightly dissolve some of the FA molecules and thus enlarge the bandgap of the perovskite films (Supplementary Figures 13 and14). The resulting 2D layer serves as a superhydrophobic protective layer with a large water contact angle over 90° due to the long carbon chain (Supplementary Fig. 13j), and thus it would greatly improve the stability of the corresponding devices.</p>
        <p>To visualize the defect passivation effect through the above strategies, the time-resolved confocal PL microscopy measurement was performed to characterize the charge carrier lifetime of these perovskite films in microdomain (10 μm × 10 μm) as shown in Fig. 3g-j. There was no obvious difference in the lifetime of perovskite films with or without MACl additives, both of which show a uniform green region. But it can be seen that the brighter grains and darker boundaries are clear for the film with MACl additives. After the introduction of excess PbI2, the dark boundaries transit to a light red color with a longer PL lifetime, indicating that the excess PbI2 could passivate the grain boundaries effectively. Moreover, the post-treatment of the perovskite film with DABr turns a relatively large fraction of the film into a red and yellow-colored region, which means that the PL lifetime is greatly enhanced. These results indicate that this series of processes can effectively passivate the perovskite grains and/or surface to reduce the trap-induced or non-radiative recombination in the films, which would be beneficial to improve the performance of the corresponding devices.</p>
        <p>To evaluate the photovoltaic performance of these perovskite films through the above strategies, a standard structure of FTO/SnO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au is employed as shown in the energy level diagram (Supplementary Fig. 15), which exhibits a more preferable energy level alignment for charge transport with the bulk and surface passivation. The champion J-V curves of the corresponding devices based on these different spin-coated perovskite films without the use of antisolvent are shown in Fig. 4a. The pristine device with the FA0.88Cs0.12PbI3 perovskite as the light absorber layer exhibits a relatively low efficiency of 18.99% with large hysteresis. With the modulation induced by MACl, a significantly improved efficiency of over 22% is achieved. The efficiency can be further improved to over 23% by the introduction of excess PbI2. Finally, after the post-treatment with DABr, much higher efficiency of close to 24% was achieved, mainly because Voc was dramatically improved by passivating the defects and subsequently reducing the charge recombination. All the detailed parameters derived from the J-V curves are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. The corresponding statistic distribution of photovoltaic parameters for these different perovskite-based devices shows a clear improvement tendency by this series of processing strategies (Supplementary Fig. 16). The typical steady-state output efficiencies for the different devices are shown in Supplementary Fig. 17. However, the devices still show an obvious hysteresis.</p>
        <p>To further suppress the hysteresis, we introduced the KPF6 additives in the precursor ink according to our previous report 24 . A champion efficiency of 24.02% is obtained for the optimized device with negligible hysteresis (Fig. 4b). The corresponding integrated Jsc of 24.0 mA•cm -2 from external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra matches well with the measured Jsc from the J-V characterization (Fig. 4c). The typical devices also exhibit good light soaking stability and thermal stability, which delivered an expectant T80 lifetime over 1000 hours at MPP under one-sun irradiation and an average ~90% efficiency retention after 20 days at 65 ℃ (Supplementary Fig. 18). We also demonstrate high-efficiency perovskite solar mini-modules on 5 cm × 5 cm substrates with a high geometrical fill factor (~96%) by the precise control of the P1-P2-P3 process (Supplementary Fig. 19). The corresponding 5 cm × 5 cm solar mini-module demonstrates a high efficiency of 20.5% on an aperture area of 22.4 cm 2 , which corresponds to an active area efficiency of 21.4% and a total area efficiency of 18.4% on a 25.0 cm 2 substrate, respectively (Fig. 4d).</p>
        <p>Scalability and stability are currently the two major obstacles to realizing the commercial application of perovskite solar cells. By the modulation of self-drying FA-Cs perovskite ink through this series of strategies, a large-area high-quality and stable perovskite film can be blade coated in a simple glovebox with a rough control of the local atmosphere (temperature = 15 ± 5 ℃; relative humidity = 15 ± 5%, where a lower temperature is helpful to initiate the crystallization process after formation of uniform nuclei 39 and lower humidity is helpful to facilitate the nucleation process, and thus contributes to a denser and smoother morphology as shown in supplementary Fig. S20 and Supplementary Note 2). Fig. 5a illustrates the printing of large-size perovskite films by a blade coating setup with an additional gas-assisted drying system, which enables fast and homogenous volatilization of the host solvent and results in a uniform and dark black large-area perovskite film.</p>
        <p>Characterization results performed on 5 different locations on the large-area 15 cm × 15 cm perovskite film indicate that the scalable printed film is of a high level of uniformity (Supplementary Fig. 21). By contrast, without the modulation of the precursor ink, the large-area film shows a porous feature (Supplementary Fig. 22).</p>
        <p>Then we used the blade coated high-quality large-area perovskite films to fabricate 15 cm × 15 cm perovskite solar sub-modules, which is only limited by the processing scale of our laser machine and evaporation system. A uniform purple color spiro-OMeTAD film is achieved on the top of this uniform perovskite substrate by blade coating (Supplementary Fig. 23a-b). The cross-sectional SEM image of the perovskite solar module shows a uniform perovskite layer with micro-size grains sandwiched by a uniform spiro-OMeTAD layer and a thin SnO2 layer (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 23c). The photographs and design of the P1-P2-P3 pattern of a 15 cm × 15 cm perovskite solar sub-module are shown in Supplementary Fig. 24. By these strategies, a champion efficiency of 15.3% is obtained for a 15 cm × 15 cm perovskite solar sub-module containing 21 sub-cells with an aperture area of 205 cm 2 as shown in Fig. 5c. Supplementary Fig. 25a andb show the typical reverse scan (RS) and forward scan (FS) of a large 15 cm × 15 cm perovskite solar sub-module, as well as the output current density under maximum power point. Supplementary Fig. 25c shows the efficiency distribution of 15 cm × 15 cm perovskite solar sub-modules that were fabricated on different days. The module efficiencies from different upscaling methods with different aperture areas over 150 cm 2 are summarized in Supplementary Fig. 25d and Supplementary Table 2. The photovoltaic conversion efficiency of the high-quality perovskite films obtained in this work using intermediate phase-modulated strategies is relatively higher than all other reported works, within comparable size and printing technology, indicating the great promise for scalable printing of largesize perovskite solar panels. To further understand the PCE difference between the small area cells and sub-modules and their origins, we measured the J-V curves of the small cells (Supplementary Fig. 25 e-f, Supplementary Table 4), which were cut at 5 different locations from a 15 cm × 15 cm sub-module. The relatively small difference in PCE between the separately prepared small cells (PCE ~ 24%) and the small cells cut from the 15 cm × 15 cm sub-module (PCE ~ 21%) indicates that the relatively large PCE difference between the separately prepared small cells (PCE ~ 24%) and the 15 cm × 15 cm sub-modules (PCE ~ 15%) is due to not only film uniformity issues when upscaling solar cells from small areas to large areas and fabrication environmental condition differences between small cell fabrication and large area sub-module fabrication, but also other factors (such as sheet resistance of FTO substrates, issues related to laser scribing, etc.).</p>
        <p>In addition, we also characterized the operational stability of the solar mini-module as shown in Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 26, which exhibited a T80 lifetime over 1000 hours at MPPT under one-sun irradiation. The initial output PCE of 19.2% is consistent with the efficiency (19.5%) derived from the J-V curve (Fig. 5e, Supplementary table 3). Interestingly, although the efficiency of the mini-module dropped to 15.3% after exposure to light for over 1000 hours, it almost reversibly recovered to 19.1% after storage in dark. Therefore, this modulation strategy of the FA-Cs perovskite precursor ink provides a promising technology for scalable manufacturing of efficient and relatively stable large-scale perovskite solar modules.</p>
        <p>In summary, we report an efficient upscaling fabrication strategy of high-quality and stable FA-Cs perovskite films by modulating crystal growth from the self-drying precursor ink without the use of anti-solvent. The obstacles in the formation of high-quality FA0.88Cs0.12PbI3 perovskite films have been overcome via this strategy through the addition of MACl in the co-solvent system of N,Ndimethylformamide (DMF)/ N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), which dramatically lower down the formation energy and enlarge the crystal size of the perovskite films, contributing to scalable deposition of large-area high-quality stable perovskite films successfully. For small-sized solar cells, a high efficiency of 24.02% is achieved by further passivation of both the grain boundaries and surface via an in situ formed excess PbI2 and the corresponding formed 2D capping layer, as well as the KPF6 additives. For solar mini-modules, a relatively high efficiency of 20.5% on an aperture area of 22.4 cm 2 with a high geometrical fill factor of 96% is demonstrated for a 5 cm × 5 cm solar mini-module. For large-scale solar sub-modules fabricated by a blade coating technique, a champion efficiency of 15.3% with an aperture area of 205 cm 2 is demonstrated. In addition, the solar minimodules exhibit impressive stability with a T80 lifetime over 1000 hours at MPPT under one-sun illumination. We expect that our modulation strategy of the precursor ink will pave the way towards the commercial production of high-performance and stable perovskite solar modules in the near future.</p>

        <p>Precursor solution preparation. The different perovskite precursor solutions were prepared based on a stoichiometric composition of FA0.88Cs0.12PbI3-NMP perovskite materials dissolved in DMF solvent with further addition of the different amounts of MACl, PbI2, and KPF6 (with molar ratio to perovskite as mentioned in the main text file. If we wake the FA0.88Cs0.12PbI3-0.3MACl-NMP/DMF solution as the example, 151.4 mg FAI, 31.2 mg CsI, 461 mg PbI2, 20.3 mg MACl and 96 uL NMP are dissolved in 500 uL DMF to form the precursor solution). The spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 90 mg spiro-OMeTAD in 1 mL chlorobenzene, adding 21 μL Li-TFSI (from 520 mg mL -1 stock acetonitrile solution) and 11 μL FK209 (300 mg mL -1 stock acetonitrile solution) and 35 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine.</p>
        <p>Small-size perovskite solar cell fabrication. The FTO glass was firstly etched using a laser scribe machine. Then it was cleaned through ultrasonic cleaning by detergent, pure water, and ethyl alcohol for 20 min, respectively. After drying by dry-air blowing, it was treated by UVO for 15 min before use. The SnO2 layer was deposited onto a clean FTO substrate of different sizes by a chemical bath deposition (CBD) method 24 . Then a 2 M FA0.88Cs0.12PbI3-NMP/DMF perovskite precursor solution with further addition of different additives was simply spin-coated onto SnO2/FTO substrates in an N2-filled glovebox (temperature ~15 ℃; relative humidity &lt;5%) at 5000 rpm for 60 s, respectively.</p>
        <p>Then the films were annealed at 70 ℃ for 1 min and taken out for further annealing at 150 ℃ for 10 min in an ambient environment with a relative humidity of 20~30%. All the achieved perovskite films were treated with 15 mM DABr/IPA solution at 4000 rpm for 20 s, and then annealed at 100 ℃ for 5 min. The spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated on the perovskite films at 4000 rpm for 20 s. Finally, 80-nm thick of gold was deposited using thermal evaporation to complete the whole device.</p>
        <p>5 cm × 5 cm perovskite solar mini-module fabrication. The designated P1 pattern of FTO glass is customized from the Yingkou OPV Tech New Energy Co., Ltd as depicted in Supplementary Fig. 19. Then it was cleaned and deposited with the SnO2 layer as described above. The perovskite films were spin-coated onto the 5 cm × 5 cm substrates and annealed according to the above procedures.</p>
        <p>It should be noted that it is better to use a gas-assisted method to remove large amounts of volatile DMF gas immediately. Otherwise, it will react with the dry film and affect the nucleation process.</p>
        <p>After the treatment with DABr and spin-coating of spiro-OMeTAD films, the samples were etched by a picosecond laser (Picosecond Laser Processing System, LPS-R002A, Spectronix Corporation.</p>
        <p>The laser wavelength is 532 nm and the pulse duration is 12 ± 3 ps to form a P2 pattern (the used power is 3.0 W and the average fluence per pulse is ~0.23 J cm -2 pulse -1 ) and to subsequently form a P3 pattern (the used power is 3.8 W and the average fluence per pulse is ~0.29 J cm -2 pulse -1 ) according to Supplementary Fig. 19 after evaporation of gold electrodes.</p>
        <p>15 cm × 15 cm perovskite solar sub-module fabrication. The designated P1 pattern of FTO glass is depicted in Supplementary Fig. 24. Then it was cleaned and deposited with the SnO2 layer as described above. The 1.25 M perovskite precursor ink were blade coated onto the 15 cm × 15 cm substrates in a simple glovebox with a rough control of the local atmosphere (temperature = 15 ± 5 ℃; relative humidity = 15 ± 5%) and then Then the films were taken out for annealing at 70 ℃ for 1 min and further annealing at 150 ℃ for 10 min in an ambient environment with relative humidity 20~30%. The perovskite precursor ink was manually supplied to the coater head during the coating process. The distance between the blade coater head and the substrate was 0.35 mm (Z =0.35 mm). The motor rotation frequency for the blade coating process was set as 500 Hz, corresponding to a coating speed of ~ 3 mm/s. The angle between the air knife and substrate was about 60°. The N2-gas pressure was set at ~0.3 MPa. Then a 5 mM DABr/IPA solution was blade coated onto the perovskite substrates accordingly, which was followed by thermal annealing at 100 ℃ for 5 min. The spiro-OMeTAD solution was also blade coated onto the substrates accordingly. The samples were etched by a picosecond laser to form a P2 pattern and etched again to form a P3 pattern according to Supplementary Fig. 24 after evaporation of the gold electrode.</p>
        <p>The I-V characteristics of the perovskite solar cells were measured using a Keithley 2420 source meter in the dry room (temperature = 15 ± 5 ℃, relative humidity = 25 ± 5 %). The light source is a solar simulator (Newport Oriel Sol 1A, xenon lamp, USHIO, UXL-150SO) to match AM 1.5 G. The intensity of the light is 100 mW cm -2 calibrated by using a KG3 reference silicon cell (Enlitech). The EQE spectra were measured by using Oriel IQE 200. All the devices were tested using a black metal mask with an aperture area of 0.16 cm 2 for the small devices and 22.4 cm 2 for the 5 cm × 5 cm mini-modules and 205 cm 2 for the 15 cm× 15 cm sub-modules, respectively. The I-V scan range was from -0.1 to 1.2 V for the small-size solar cells and from -0.1 to 8.5 V for the mini-modules and from -0.5 to 25 V for the sub-modules. The corresponding I-V (or J-V) curves were measured at scan rates of ~0.2 V s -1 for the small-area solar cells, ~0.8 V s -1 for the 5 cm × 5 cm mini-modules and ~2.0 V s -1 for the 15 cm× 15 cm sub-modules respectively without preconditioning.</p>
        <p>Light stability testing. The perovskite solar cells under maximum power point (MPP) and minimodules under maximum power point tracking (MPPT) were tested in our home-designed environmental enclosure box under a flow of dry N2 to keep the relative humidity below 5% (Supplementary Fig. 26). The devices were illuminated by a solar simulator (PEC-L01, Peccel) and the power output was measured continuously using a source meter (Keithley 2401) controlled by a 
            <rs type="software">program</rs> written in 
            <rs type="software">Labview</rs>. The algorithm used for MPPT is based on perturbation-observation. It starts by applying the maximum voltage derived from the first I-V curve (Fig. 5d), then the applied voltage is perturbed every minute with a small voltage variation to search for maximum power point, and the corresponding maximum voltage, maximum current and maximum power are recorded.

        <p>Characterization. The surface morphologies of the perovskite films and the cross-sectional structure of the PSCs were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (FEI Quanta 250 FEG FEI Quanta 250 FEG). The UPS and XPS measurements were conducted by using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (AXIS Ultra HAS, Kratos) equipped with monochromatic Al Kα (1,486.6 eV) and non-monochromatic HeI (21.22 eV) sources. X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 Discover), UV-vis spectrometer (V-670, JASCO), Time-resolved confocal PL microscopy (Micro Time 200, PicoQuant GmbH), Mass spectrometry (HAL 3F-510, Hiden Analytical), were used for the characterization of perovskite films, respectively. The atomic force microscopy topography images in Supplementary Fig. 11b were acquired by an atomic force microscope (Model: Park NX10) in the non-contact mode using a Si cantilever with a nominal spring constant of 42 N m -1 (Model: PPP-NCHR). The atomic force microscopy topography images in Supplementary Fig. 20e, Supplementary Fig. 21d and Supplementary Fig. 22d were acquired by an atomic force microscope (Model: Asylum Research MFP-3D) in the tapping mode using a Si cantilever with a nominal spring constant of 48 N m -1 (Model: Budget Sensors Tap190Al-G).</p>
        <p>Computational methods. All calculations were carried on the basis of projector-augmented wave method as implemented in the 
            <rs type="software">Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)</rs>
            <rs type="software">code</rs> [41][42][43] . Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was employed to describe the exchange-correlation interaction 44 . Van der Waals correction proposed by the Grimme potential (D2) was considered 45 . The plane-wave basis cutoff energy was set to be 400 eV. The Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh was sampled with a separation of about 0.015 Å -1 in the Brillouin zone. All structures were relaxed until the residual force on each atom was less than 0.01 eV/Å. The self-consistent convergence accuracy was set at 10 -5 eV/atom in the structural calculation.
