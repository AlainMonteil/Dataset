        <p>Linking in-situ charge accumulation to electronic structure in doped SrTiO3 reveals design principles for hydrogen evolving photocatalysts. Nature Materials. NM19124170B.</p>
        <p>operational parameters such as the potential drop when contacted with electrolyte remain unmeasured, limiting understanding of the factors that may facilitate charge separation in this remarkable material. 27,29 Herein, we combine time resolved optical spectroscopies performed in situ on (La),Rh:SrTiO 3 photocatalyst sheets with direct electronic structure measurements supported by density functional theory (DFT) to reveal the remarkable interplay between Fermi level position, Rh 4d structure and band bending/charge separation in Rh:SrTiO 3 materials. Figures 1a-b show optical absorption spectra and photographs of SrTiO 3 , Rh:SrTiO 3 , hydrogen reduced Rh:SrTiO 3 (H 2 -Rh:SrTiO 3 ) and La,Rh:SrTiO 3 powders used to fabricate photocatalyst sheets. XRD showed all powders to be phase pure -consisting of single perovskite phase (Supplementary Fig. S0). Upon doping SrTiO 3 with Rh, a purple powder is obtained showing a 0.4 eV red-shift in the effective optical band gap (Tauc plots in Supplementary Fig. S1) alongside two strongly broadened sub-bandgap absorption features between ~500-800 nm and ~900-1200 nm. After chemically reducing Rh:SrTiO 3 in a hydrogen atmosphere, the powder turns bright yellow and the absorption spectrum shows a further red-shift in the effective band edge and the disappearance of the additional absorption features, consistent with previous observations. 8,27 XPS indicates the reduction of Rh 4+ , predominantly to Rh 3+ (Supplementary Fig. S2.1-S2.3). A similar effect is observed when Rh:SrTiO 3 is co-doped with La. Here, a light-yellow powder is obtained. XPS reveals a Rh:La ratio of 1:1 in our samples and the reduction of Rh 4+ to Rh 3+ . This is in agreement with previous studies which reported that La 3+ substitution at Sr 2+ sites can effectively facilitate the reduction of Rh 4+ to Rh 3+ via an ionic charge compensation mechanism, 23,29,30 and shows that La co-doping has an effect analogous to chemical reduction.</p>
        <p>We fabricated photocatalyst sheet half-electrodes from these powders using a modified particle transfer method (see Methods). Cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 1c, EDX mapping in Supplementary Fig. S3) show that these modified photocatalyst sheets consist of a layer of partially sintered oxide particles embedded in a 2 µm thick Au back contact. These photocatalyst sheet half-electrodes permit us to study the properties of Rh:SrTiO 3 and La,Rh:SrTiO 3 under operational conditions, meaning in electrolyte solution, under illumination and in the potential window a z-scheme device is . This is colored according to EDX mapping results (Supplementary Fig. S3).</p>
        <p>likely to operate during water splitting. As such the results shown in Figure 2 track electrode processes and transformation in situ and thus differ from ex situ studies published thus far. Spectroelectrochemical (SEC) measurements of a Rh:SrTiO 3 photocatalyst sheet shown in Figure 2a track the change in optical absorption at the surface of Rh:SrTiO 3 as the potential is varied from 1.1 V RHE towards -0.2 V RHE . The differential absorption spectra at more negative potentials show a redshift in absorption around the effective band edge (positive ΔF(R)) that occurs in concert with the loss of absorption from the sub-band gap features (negative ΔF(R)). This trend is reversible when the potential is scanned in the opposite direction (Supplementary Fig. S4a). ΔF(R) of the sub-band gap features exhibits sigmoidal behaviour with respect to applied potential, typical of a redox couple, with E 1/2 located at 0.52 V RHE (Supplementary Fig. S4b and Fig. 2f discussed further below). A similar differential absorption spectrum can be obtained by subtracting the absorption spectrum of (Rh 4+ ) Rh:SrTiO 3 from (Rh 3+ ) H 2 -Rh:SrTiO 3 (Fig. 2b). We therefore attribute the optical changes observed in Rh:SrTiO 3 photocatalyst sheets under applied potential to the reversible reduction of Rh 4+ to Rh 3+ within the space charge layer. This is corroborated by cyclic voltammograms showing a reversible redox wave within the same potential window (Supplementary Fig. S4c). In contrast, the optical absorption of La,Rh:SrTiO 3 sheets shows negligible absorption changes over this potential range (Supplementary Fig. S4d), consistent with an ionic charge compensation mechanism, which fixes Rh predominantly in the 3+ oxidation state independent of applied bias.</p>
        <p>Figure 2c shows potential dependent transient absorption (TA) of (La),Rh:SrTiO 3 106 photocatalyst sheet half-electrodes. We excited samples with a UV laser flash and monitored 107 the kinetics at 1250 nm, spanning the μs-s timescales relevant to water splitting reactions 32 . 108 TA studies of SrTiO 3 and La,Rh:SrTiO 3 using electron and hole scavengers (Supplementary 109 2 ) with a 1250 nm probe light used to monitor electrons. (d) Photoinduced absorption (PIA) kinetics in Rh:SrTiO 3 and (e) La,Rh:SrTiO 3 photocatalyst sheets at various applied potentials, tracking conduction band electrons monitored at 1250 nm. The sample was irradiated with 365 nm LED light for several seconds (8 mW cm -2 , shaded region) before the LED was switched off again. (f) Overlay of normalised differential absorption as a function of potential extracted from: i) the 620 nm bleaching signal in SEC, normalised against the bleaching minimum at 620 nm and 0 V RHE (Fig. 2a) ii) TA signals measured at 5 µs and 1 ms normalised against the 0 V RHE signal at these times (Fig. 2c) and iii) the maximum PIA amplitude, normalised using the PIA maximum at 0 V RHE (Fig. 2d,e) for Rh:SrTiO 3 and La,Rh:SrTiO 3 photocatalyst sheets. All data points for Rh:SrTiO 3 sheets were then fitted to a sigmoidal (logistic decay type) function, yielding a midpoint at 0.52 V RHE . A linear function was used to fit datapoints for La,Rh:SrTiO 3 sheets. Electrolyte in all measurements: 0.1 M Na 2 SO 4 solution (pH 7). absorption) is observed on the μs-ms timescale. SEC of Rh:SrTiO 3 sheets (Fig. 2a) indicates that a loss of sub-band gap absorption is associated with the removal of Rh 4+ states from the system. Consequently, we attribute the 1250 nm bleach observed in Rh:SrTiO 3 sheets at positive applied potentials to a loss of Rh 4+ states after excitation, presumably related to electron trapping by Rh 4+ states. This is in agreement with ex-situ observations made by Murthy et al 33 and is also concordant with a linear dependence of the amplitude of this feature on laser intensity (Supplementary Fig. 5.3b,c). In contrast, at potentials close to 0 V RHE , positive transients are observed with power law decay kinetics identical to La,Rh:SrTiO 3 (Supplementary Fig. S5.3d). By extension, we therefore also assign absorption at 1250 nm in Rh:SrTiO 3 sheets at negative applied potentials to CB electrons. A change in the fate of photogenerated electrons in Rh:SrTiO 3 photocatalyst sheets is further supported by the TA spectrum of Rh:SrTiO 3 (Supplementary Fig. S5.4a), which is similar to La,Rh:SrTiO 3 at negative potentials but dissimilar at positive potentials (Supplementary Fig. S5.4b). To evaluate photocatalyst sheets under operational conditions and study the accumulation of charges at the oxide surface available for catalysis, we monitored electron dynamics (1250 nm probe) during and after long pulse illumination (15-20s) with a 365 nm LED (Fig. 2d-e and Methods). The resulting photoinduced absorption (PIA) spectra of Rh:SrTiO 3 and La,Rh:SrTiO 3 sheets (Supplementary Fig. S5.5a-c) exhibit a similar shape and potential dependence to the respective TA spectra (Supplementary Fig. 5.4a,b), indicating that the same species are monitored at 1250 nm in both experiments. We observe that electron accumulation during irradiation is strongly potential-dependent in Rh:SrTiO 3 photocatalyst sheets (Fig. 2d), but broadly potential-independent in La,Rh:SrTiO 3 sheets (Fig. 2e). At positive potentials (e.g. 1.1 V RHE ) Rh:SrTiO 3 shows a small ground state bleach. This signal transforms into a growing positive absorption as the applied potential approaches 0 V RHE . After the LED is turned off, the small bleach signal at positive applied potentials recovers on a similar timescale (~100 ms) to that seen in TAS (Fig. 2c). In contrast, at negative potentials, absorption signals persist for tens of seconds after the LED is turned off. Figure 2f summarises the potential dependence of our in-situ studies; plotting signal amplitudes of SEC (Fig. 2a), TA (Fig 2c) and PIA (Fig. 2d,e) against electrode potential for Rh:SrTiO 3 and La,Rh:SrTiO 3 photocatalyst sheets. In Rh:SrTiO 3 photocatalyst sheets, normalised TA signals, as well as the maximum PIA amplitude of accumulated electrons track the redox wave behaviour of our SEC measurements (Supplementary Fig. S4b). This overlay clearly shows that the photogeneration of long-lived conduction band electrons is strongly linked to Rh 4+ reduction in Rh:SrTiO 3 sheets. In summary, this data indicates that under operational conditions, Rh:SrTiO 3 photocatalyst sheets only generate long-lived electrons for biases &lt;&lt; 0.52 V RHE (i.e.</p>
        <p>), whilst La,Rh:SrTiO 3 sheets produce long-lived electrons even under strongly positive (+1 V RHE ) potentials. As we later discuss, the ability to accumulate charge at positive potentials is critical to the efficient operation of the complete water splitting Z-scheme in photocatalyst sheets.</p>
        <p>To better understand the link between the fundamental photophysical properties of (La),Rh:SrTiO 3 and the oxidation state of Rh, we turn to DFT-supported VB XPS. Comparing VB spectra of SrTiO 3 , Rh:SrTiO 3 and La,Rh:SrTiO 3 (Fig. 3a), we observe a significant Fermi level (E F ) shift in both Rh-doped oxides towards the effective VB edge, consistent with p-type conductivity as observed by Kudo et al. 34 E F of SrTiO 3 , Rh:SrTiO 3 and La,Rh:SrTiO 3 is located ~1.8 eV, ~0.1 eV and ~0.3 eV above their respective VB edges (linear extrapolation see Supplementary Fig. S2.1f). As a result, all peaks shift in accordance with the observed Fermi level change seen in the VB spectrum (Supplementary Figure S2.2a), consistent with previous observations of Rh doped oxides. 35,36 This effect prevents direct comparison of relative energies of Rh states in the VB region on the binding energy (E B ) scale. 35 However, the binding energy relative to lattice O 2-in the O 1s spectrum (ΔE B vs O 1s) should be independent of this effect 36 (Supplementary Figure S2.2a and accompanying equation). Comparison of the VB spectra of doped and undoped materials, plotted relative to the lattice O 2-binding energy (Fig. 3b), allows us to see that Rh doping introduces states above the VB maximum and below the VB minimum of SrTiO 3 , leading to a broadening of the VB envelope and a narrowing of the effective band gap, consistent with our observations in Fig. 1a. Closer inspection of the region around the VB maximum (Supplementary Fig. S2.2b) shows that the states introduced by Rh doping are shifted to higher energy upon La co-doping. The same effect is also observed when Rh:SrTiO 3 is reduced in a hydrogen atmosphere (Supplementary Figure S2.3f), implying that this shift is the result of Rh 4+ reduction rather than any additional orbital contribution from La. This effect is consistent with the red shift in the effective band edge observed when Rh:SrTiO 3 is reduced (Fig. 2a,b). To verify our analysis of the VB spectra, and to provide insight into the nature of the Rh states introduced by doping, we turned to hybrid DFT. The HSE06 functional was combined with an unprecedentedly large 3x3x3 supercell to enable accurate reproduction of the nominal Rh-doping concentration to calculate and compare the electronic structure of doped, co-doped and undoped SrTiO 3 (see Methods for further details). The calculated densities of states (DOS) for the VB region of Rh:SrTiO 3 and La,Rh:SrTiO 3 (Fig. 3c) reveal that the broadening of the VB region observed experimentally upon Rh doping is caused by the introduction of Rh 4d states above the VB maximum and below the VB minimum of SrTiO 3 . Moreover, DFT accurately predicts that in Rh:SrTiO 3 , Rh 4d states are more deeply situated than in La,Rh:SrTiO 3 , which is verified by our experiments as detailed above (Fig. 1a and3b). No La orbital character is observed near the band edges (Supplementary Fig. S6.1b), consistent with the concept that La 3+ induces the reduction of Rh 4+ via an ionic charge compensation mechanism but does not directly alter band edge composition. 29 Most strikingly, a vacant mid gap state with Rh 4d character is observed in Rh:SrTiO 3 (red arrow, Fig. 3c) which is absent in La,Rh:SrTiO 3 . As this state does not have La orbital character, and an analogous effect can be achieved by introducing an electron to Rh:SrTiO 3 in the presence of a compensating background charge (which localises on Rh 4+ during optimisation, Supplementary Fig. S6.1d, S6.2), we attribute this change to Rh 4+ reduction. Further, integration of the Rh 4d DOS shows that the density of filled Rh 4d states at the VB edge effectively increases by one electron upon reduction. This indicates that the Rh 4d electronic structure re-arranges as an electron is added to Rh 4+ and the mid gap state is incorporated into the VB (for discussion see Supplementary Fig. S6.2, S6.3). Figure 4 summarises energy band diagrams of SrTiO 3 and its doped equivalents determined from our SEC and DFT-supported XPS experiments. From DFT we obtain electron affinities, which are in good agreement with literature values for CB edge energies (E CB ) of SrTiO 3 , 37 and indicate that E CB is largely insensitive to doping (Supplementary Fig. S6.4). As DFT calculations often slightly underestimate E g , we use our UV-vis spectra (Fig. 1a) to position the VB edge energies on an absolute energy scale, in reasonable agreement with our calculated ionisation potentials (Supplementary Fig. S6.4). From VB XPS (Fig. 3a), we estimate the Fermi level position relative to the VB (in the absence of band bending) and find it to be in excellent agreement with independent measurements of a very positive flatband potential of La,Rh:SrTiO 3 photocatalyst sheets (+1.8 V RHE ) using impedance spectroscopy, consistent with reported p-type character. 24,30,31 Finally, we estimate the reduction potential of Rh 4+ states using the half-wave potential obtained from SEC (Supplementary Fig. S4b) and combine it with our DFT results to locate the vacant mid-gap state.</p>
        <p>In Figure 5, we use the energy band diagrams in Figure 4 to illustrate the expected potentialdependence of depletion layer formation in (La),Rh:SrTiO 3 , and relate these to our potentialdependent SEC, PIA and TA measurements (Fig. 2). A striking result of this analysis is that in both La,Rh:SrTiO 3 (Fig. 5a) and Rh:SrTiO 3 (Fig. 5b), a strong potential drop at the semiconductor-electrolyte liquid junction is created even at the most positive potentials studied (e.g. 1 V RHE ) due to their strongly positive flatband potentials (Fig 4). The field in the depletion region at these potentials appears to be sufficient to efficiently separate charge in La,Rh:SrTiO 3 , as inducing a further volt of band bending (i.e. at 0 V RHE ) yields only a modest increase in the photogeneration of long-lived CB electrons under operational conditions (Fig. 2e). This implies that the downward shift in flatland potentials induced by Rh doping drives effective charge separation even at positive applied potentials. This is consistent with the remarkably early onset potentials (up to 1.2 V RHE ) previously observed in photocatalyst sheet half-electrodes. 25 However, despite a similar flatband potential to La,Rh:SrTiO 3 , Rh:SrTiO 3 is unable to photogenerate long-lived electrons at equivalent positive potentials (i.e. 1 V RHE ). Instead, Rh:SrTiO 3 shows a yield of CB electrons which tracks the redox wave originating from Rh 4+ reduction (Fig. 2f, Supplementary Fig. S4b), with the largest changes occurring around E 1/2 of the Rh 4+ /Rh 3+ redox couple. Only at potentials negative of this redox potential do the yields and lifetimes of CB electrons in Rh:SrTiO 3 and La,Rh:SrTiO 3 converge. In Figure 5c we use our model to explain this behaviour. At potentials positive of E 1/2 , minority carriers in Rh:SrTiO 3 are trapped and recombine via mid-gap Rh 4+ states. The quasi-Fermi level of electrons (E F,n ) is therefore likely to be pinned to these mid-gap states, leading to a diminished photovoltage in comparison to La,Rh:SrTiO 3 (Supplementary Fig. 7). At 4+ becomes reduced, leading to a re-organisation of the Rh 4d states -adopting the electronic configuration of a reduced Rh:SrTiO 3 (indicated by yellow colouring), which is almost identical to that of La,Rh:SrTiO 3 . This is corroborated by a 0.15 eV red-shift in the effective band gap that we observe in our SEC experiments (Fig. 2a). (c) Photovoltage build-up in La,Rh:SrTiO 3 and Rh:SrTiO 3 under illumination at positive device operation potentials. Here, conduction band electrons can accumulate in La,Rh:SrTiO 3 due to strong downward band bending leading to effective charge separation. This is indicated by a quasi-Fermi level for electrons (E F,n ) reaching towards the CB. In Rh:SrTiO 3 , a similarly strong potential drop develops at the surface, however, trapping processes likely related to the trapping of electrons by Rh 4+ states prevent the accumulation of electrons, indicated by a quasi-Fermi level pinned to the Rh 4+ redox potential. This in turn leads to smaller photovoltage developing in Rh:SrTiO 3 .</p>
        <p>potentials negative of E ½ , Rh 4+ states in the depletion layer are reduced, and persistent CB electrons are observed (Fig. 2d). Hence, La co-doping can be understood as obviating the need for the strong negative potentials (&lt;&lt; 0.52 V RHE ) or chemically reducing conditions 23,25,27,38 that would be otherwise required to reduce surface Rh 4+ states. This suppresses electron trapping, leading to the build-up of a higher photovoltage due to the accumulation of minority carriers on timescales of the water splitting reaction. Due to current matching requirements, the operation of complete photocatalyst sheet devices is thus also Rh oxidation state dependent. Hence, in a Rh:SrTiO 3 /Mo:BiVO 4 device, large yields of persistent electrons in Rh:SrTiO 3 can solely be obtained closer to the flatband potential of Mo:BiVO 4 (ca. 0.1 V RHE 39 ) or, in other words, close to the onset of photocurrent for an optimal Mo:BiVO 4 photoanode. 40,41 In contrast, in a La,Rh:SrTiO 3 /Mo:BiVO 4 device, La fixes the Rh oxidation state to Rh 3+ and removes the Rh 4+ mid-gap level without compromising the position of the Fermi level. This leads to accumulation of CB electrons even at remarkably positive potentials. This is illustrated in Figure 6 where the population of accumulated CB electrons in (La),Rh:SrTiO 3 sheets (taken from Fig. 2f) is plotted alongside a JV curve of a previously reported typical Mo:BiVO 4 photocatalyst sheet half electrode. 17 Figure 6 predicts that the crossing point of Rh:SrTiO 3 /Mo:BiVO 4 device would be at more negative potentials, where the Rh:SrTiO 3 surface is only partially reduced and the predicted photocurrent low. On the other hand, a La,Rh:SrTiO 3 /Mo:BiVO 4 crosses at a significantly more positive potential, at which photogeneration of long-lived charge carriers is high in both Mo:BiVO 4 and La,Rh:SrTiO 3 , enabling both efficient proton reduction and water oxidation. The more positive crossing point of the respective half-cell J-E curves in turn leads to a Zscheme photocatalyst sheet device requiring a metal contact with a high work function (i.e. Au), consistent with calculations in the work of Wang et al. 26 The carrier dynamics of this interface are of significant interest. However, the surface selective nature of the measurements presented here preclude study of the back contact. It is remarkable that chemical reduction of Rh:SrTiO 3 does not compromise the position of the Fermi level as would be expected from simply considering the filling of the Rh 4+ mid gap level upon reduction in the absence of any reorganization. We therefore consider the 12 oxidation state dependent Rh 4d electronic structure to be a crucial and distinguishing operational parameter in this material, as conservation of the position of the Fermi level upon chemical reduction leads to extremely positive flatband potentials being observed in the Rhdoped and La,Rh co-doped materials alike. This drives strong band bending at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface in-situ, meaning that charge separation is limited by density of the vacant mid gap levels associated only with Rh 4+ rather than the strength or width of the depletion layer. Thus, co-doping with La reduces Rh 4+ ; removing mid gap levels without strongly influencing band bending. This drives a positive shift in the crossing point of the complete Z-scheme device towards a crossing point where both water oxidation and proton reduction occurs efficiently. In conclusion, by linking charge accumulation to electronic structure in (La),Rh:SrTiO 3 we are able to explain the record device operation of the La,Rh:SrTiO 3 /Mo:BiVO 4 photocatalyst sheets. We find that Rh doping narrows the effective optical gap of SrTiO 3 and induces a strong downward shift in flatband potential, successfully creating a p-type visible light absorber. Using Rh alone to dope the wide band gap absorber produces a vacant mid-gap Rh 4d state. During illumination, this state prevents the accumulation of electrons near the conduction band and instead promotes charge trapping and recombination. Reduction of Rh 4+ leads to a reorganization of Rh 4d orbitals, integrating this state into the valence band region. While the reduction to Rh 3+ can be driven by negative applied potential or by a reductive annealing treatment, co-doping with La appears to be an elegant strategy to effectively and persistently mitigate the formation of the mid-gap state without compromising p-type character. In the absence of a mid-gap state, the strongly positive flatband potential of La,Rh:SrTiO 3 enables strong downward band bending even under relatively positive potentials (e.g. +1 V RHE ), enabling bipolar charge accumulation in the device at potentials where both the n-and p-type semiconductors separate charge efficiently. More broadly, this work identifies both electronic structure reorganisation and Fermi level effects as key parameters that must be considered in engineering novel functional visible light absorbing materials for photocatalysis. The insights gained herein lead to a deeper understanding of the interplay between electronic structure, dopant oxidation states, minority carrier lifetimes and device operation in cutting edge photocatalyst devices. Having identified the crucial role of co-doping in the function of the complete Z-scheme device, we note that a necessary prerequisite to succeeding in creating new band gap engineered visible light absorbers may be the choice of a perovskite (ABX 3 ) host lattice, such as SrTiO 3 , where two cation sites can be substituted independently of one another in a crystal lattice that is structurally tolerant to doping. This represents a crucial break from studies on TiO 2 , where only one cation site can be substituted in a lattice that is itself less tolerant to doping. 36 O 2p</p>

        <p>Synthesis of Rh and La,Rh:SrTiO 3 : Rh:SrTiO 3 and La,Rh:SrTiO 3 were synthesised by a previously reported two step solid state reaction. 25,42 In the first step, rutile TiO 2 (Kanto Chemicals, 99.0%) and SrCO 3 (Kanto Chemicals, 99.9%, calcined in air at 573 K for 1 h) were ground in a mortar to obtain a mixture with a Sr/Ti ratio of 1.05. The mixture was then calcined at 1423 K for 10 h to produce SrTiO 3 . In the second step, SrTiO 3 was ground in ethanol with Rh 2 O 3 (Kanto Chemicals, 99.9%) and calcined at 1373 K for 6 h to make Rh:SrTiO 3 . For La,Rh:SrTiO 3 fabrication, both La 2 O 3 (Kanto Chemicals, 99.99%, freshly calcined in air at 1273 K for 12 h) and Rh 2 O 3 (Kanto Chemicals, 99.9%) were calcined at 1373 K for 6 h. In both cases, La and Rh was added such that the nominal doping concentration (i.e Fabrication of photocatalyst sheets: (La),Rh:SrTiO 3 photocatalyst sheets were fabricated by a modified particle transfer method. The procedure was identical to previous reports except that Mo:BiVO 4 particles were omitted and a much thicker Au layer (ca. 2 µm as opposed to ca. 350 nm) was used to create a continuously conductive back contact. Doped SrTiO 3 (20 mg) was suspended in isopropanol (99.9%, 0.5 ml), drop-cast on a glass substrate (3×3 cm 2 ) and left to dry at room temperature overnight. The Au back contact was then deposited by thermal vacuum evaporation (VFR-200M/ERH, ULVAC KIKO) at an evaporation rate of approximately 20 nm s -1 at a base pressure of 2.6×10 -3 Pa. The exposed Au surface was then bonded to a second glass plate (3×3 cm 2 ) with double sided carbon tape and lifted off the primary glass plate. The resulting photocatalyst sheet was then ultrasonicated twice in distilled water for 2 minutes to remove any unattached particles.</p>
        <p>SEM images were taken on a LEO GEMINI 1525 microscope using a 1.5 keV electron beam and a secondary electron detector. As the back Au contact in the photocatalyst sheets provides a highly conductive pathway for charge, no conductive coating was required. EDX was performed on the same instrument using an Oxford Instruments X-act detector at a beam voltage of 20 keV and a 60 mm aperture.</p>
        <p>XPS was performed on a Thermo Scientific K-alpha+ instrument. Powdered samples were attached to a stainless-steel plate using conductive carbon tape.</p>
        <p>The instrument uses monochromated and microfocused Al Kα (hν = 1486.6 eV) radiation to eject photoelectrons which are then analysed using a 180° double-focusing hemispherical analyser with a 2D detector. Spectra were collected at 2x10 -9 mbar base pressure. A flood gun was used to minimize sample charging. All samples were referenced against the C-C peak of adventitious carbon in the C 1s spectrum at a binding energy of 284.8 eV to correct for any charge that is not neutralised by the flood gun. Further effects were then accounted for by taking the separation from the O 1s oxide peak. Data was analysed using the

The relaxed structures were then used for input to hybrid DFT calculations using the HSE06 functional 44 to calculate accurate electronic structure.</p>
        <p>Transient absorption and photoinduced absorption measurements were carried out on a home built setup described in our previous publications. 47 Briefly, micro-second to second transient absorption decays were acquired by measuring the diffuse reflectance of the opaque samples studied herein. A Nd:YAG laser (OPOTEK Opolette 355 II, 7 ns pulse width) was used as the excitation source, producing 355 nm light that was transmitted to the sample using a liquid light guide. An excitation power density of 400 µJ/cm 2 was typically used in conjunction with a laser repetition rate of 0.</p>
