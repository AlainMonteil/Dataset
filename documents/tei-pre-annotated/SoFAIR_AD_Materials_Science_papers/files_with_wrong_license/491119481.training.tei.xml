        <p>In oxidation reactions catalysed by supported metal nanoparticles with oxygen as the terminal oxidant, the rate of the oxygen reduction can be a limiting factor. This is exemplified by the oxidative dehydrogenation of alcohols, an important class of reactions with modern commercial applications [1][2][3] . For this reaction supported gold nanoparticles are very effective for the dehydrogenation of the alcohol to an aldehyde 4 but gold is less effective for oxygen reduction 5,6 . In contrast, supported palladium nanoparticles are less active for dehydrogenation but are active for oxygen reduction 5,6 . This imbalance can be overcome by alloying gold with palladium which gives enhanced activity to both reactions 7,8 ; however, the electrochemical potential of the alloy is a compromise between that of the two metals meaning that although the oxygen reduction is improved in an alloy, the dehydrogenation activity is poorer. Here we show that by separating the gold and palladium components in bimetallic carbon-supported catalysts we can almost double the reaction rate beyond that achieved with a corresponding alloy catalyst. We demonstrate this using physical mixtures of carbon-supported monometallic Au and Pd and a bimetallic catalyst comprising separated gold and palladium regions. Furthermore, we demonstrate electrochemically that this enhancement is attributable to coupling of separate redox processes occurring at isolated gold and palladium sites. The discovery of this novel catalytic effect, a cooperative redox enhancement (CORE), offers a new approach to the design of multi-component heterogeneous catalysts. ___________________________________________________________________________ Supported Au-Pd nanoalloys are effective catalysts for redox reactions 8 demonstrating rate enhancement compared with monometallic analogues, an effect referred to as synergy [8][9][10][11][12][13][14] .In oxidation reactions catalysed by supported metal nanoparticles with oxygen as the terminal oxidant, the rate of the oxygen reduction can be a limiting factor.

        <p>To date there has been no definitive demonstration of the origin of this effect, which we investigate for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alcohols 14,15 , using ODH of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) in aqueous alkaline solution as a model reaction to study the cooperative relation between Au and Pd nanoparticles. Monometallic Au, Pd and a bimetallic Au and Pd catalyst (Au:Pd atomic ratio = 4), were synthesized using sol-immobilization 18 (Extended Data Fig. 1) and supported on Vulcan XC-72R carbon (C), denoted Au/C, Pd/C and Au-Pd/C, respectively. These catalysts were investigated for HMF oxidation and reacted as a slurry (Extended Data Fig 1e), as well as a physical mixture of Au/C and Pd/C (Figs. 1a, 1b and Extended Data Fig. 2) in aqueous NaHCO3 (pH 8.7); the total moles of Au and Pd, and the mass of the carbon support were constant across experiments. HMF conversion and product yields were monitored as a function of time with the monometallic Pd/C catalyst exhibiting a very limited activity over the duration of the experiment. Nonetheless, the initial rate of reaction, determined after 5 min over a physical mixture of the two monometallic catalysts was far greater (k = 4.9 x 10 -5 M.s -1 ) than that observed with the monometallic Au/C catalyst (k = 2.5 x 10 -5 M.s -1 ) and the monometallic Pd/C catalyst (k = 2.7 x 10 -6 M.s -1 ), which could therefore not be explained simply as an additive effect. Catalytic activity immediately increased after the addition of Pd/C to a reaction mixture containing Au/C (Extended Data Fig. 2f) and was not attributed to the addition of carbon alone (Extended Data Fig. 2g). Strikingly, the rate of HMF conversion in the presence of the Au/C and Pd/C physical mixture was greater than that observed over the Au-Pd/C alloy (k = 3.8 x 10 -5 M.s -1 ); an observation which has only been noted previously in an electrocatalytic study 16 .To date there has been no definitive demonstration of the origin of this effect, which we investigate for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alcohols 14,15 , using ODH of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) in aqueous alkaline solution as a model reaction to study the cooperative relation between Au and Pd nanoparticles.

        <p>The differences in activity are further highlighted when the concentration of the terminal product formed (FDCA) is considered (Fig. 1b). The FDCA produced over the physical mixture, after 2 h of reaction, was almost 9.5 times greater than that produced over the Au/C catalyst. In multistep processes, such as this one, rate enhancements become multiplicative over sequential reactions. Thus, enhancement occurs when other oxygen-containing functionalities are oxidized. The trend in reactivity of these catalysts is amplified further when the estimated turnover frequencies (TOFs) of the materials are considered (Extended Data Fig. 2j).The differences in activity are further highlighted when the concentration of the terminal product formed (FDCA) is considered (Fig. 1b).

        <p>We next investigated the ODH of the intermediates in HMF oxidation, 5-hydroxymethyl-2furan carboxylic acid (HMFCA) and 5-formyl-2-furan carboxylic acid (FFCA), as well as a range of other alcohols, (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 3) observing the same trends in activity. Analysis of post-reaction solutions confirmed that these rate enhancements were not the result of metal leaching in any of the reactions, while STEM-XEDS confirmed no detectable metal migration occurred in reactions over the Au/C and Pd/C physical mixture (Extended Data Fig. 4).We next investigated the ODH of the intermediates in HMF oxidation, 5-hydroxymethyl-2furan carboxylic acid (HMFCA) and 5-formyl-2-furan carboxylic acid (FFCA), as well as a range of other alcohols, (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 3) observing the same trends in activity.

        <p>We investigated a semiconducting support (TiO2) and an insulating support (BN) to compare with the highly conducting XC72-R carbon support 17,18 (Fig. 1d, Extended Data Fig. 3e). With a physical mixture of Au/C and Pd/BN, the total yield of products formed was comparable to the sum generated in the reactions using Au/C and Pd/BN independently (Au/C+Pd/BN: 20.3%; Au/C: 17.9%; Pd/BN: 1.1%). When Pd/TiO2 was combined with Au/C product yields notably greater than the sum of Au/C and Pd/TiO2 independently were observed (Au/C+Pd/TiO2: 29.2%; Au/C: 17.9%; Pd/TiO2: 0.5%). Support effects in heterogeneous catalysis have many dimensions but these experiments show that the rate enhancement correlates well with the ability of the support material to accept and conduct electrons to and from the surface reaction sites. While TiO2 provides limited conductivity and a conduction band edge at ~-0.37 V vs RHE for anatase structured TiO2 that can accept electrons from the HMF oxidation step, the higher band gap of BN acts as a barrier to this transport.We investigated a semiconducting support (TiO2) and an insulating support (BN) to compare with the highly conducting XC72-R carbon support 17,18 (Fig. 1d, Extended Data Fig. 3e).

        <p>Quantities of C, TiO2 and BN were added to reactions containing physical mixtures of monometallic Au and Pd supported catalysts (Fig. 1e). The addition of C to a physical mixture of Au/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2, or BN supported analogues, resulted in a notable increase in catalytic reactivity based on the mass of C added. On the contrary, the addition of less conductive TiO2, or non-conductive BN, to a physical mixture of Au/C and Pd/C led to a decrease in the rate of reaction; the suppression was greatest in the reactions where BN was added. Graphene nanoplatelets (30 mg) were added to a physical mixture of Au/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 a greater enhancement in activity was observed, compared with the addition of C-XC72R, suggesting that other additive properties (in addition to conductivity) are likely to influence electron transport. Ultimately, these experiments suggest that substrate conversion over physical mixtures of Au and Pd monometallic catalysts can be enhanced through the incorporation of additives which are electronically conductive but are not by themselves catalytically active (Extended Data Fig. 3e). Further optimization and understanding of mitigating properties could undoubtedly lead to even greater activity enhancement. X-ray Photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and temperature programmed reduction (TPR) indicated that some Pd oxidation occurred during the reaction of a physical mixture of Au/C and Pd/C (Extended Data Fig. 5).Quantities of C, TiO2 and BN were added to reactions containing physical mixtures of monometallic Au and Pd supported catalysts (Fig. 1e).

        <p>Hence, we propose a reaction scheme (Fig. 2) that explains the cooperative role of Au and Pd in alcohol and (hydrated) formyl oxidation reactions. Building on current understanding 16,19 , we consider that the oxidation of HMF to HMFCA proceeds through a dehydrogenation reaction on the Au surface, which generates two protons in solution and two electrons that are transferred, via the support material, to Pd 2+ where they are consumed in an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR); the catalytic cycle is completed by the rapid reaction in the liquid phase of the product hydroxide ions with protons. Increasing the pH of the reaction mixture affects the reaction rate by activating the substrate towards oxidation but not the electron-transfer mechanism. The oxidation of reaction intermediates HMFCA and FFCA are considered to proceed in the same way, terminating at FDCA. Alcohol oxidation over Au-supported catalysts is therefore proposed to be influenced by the rate of the coupled ORR occurring on Pd and the ease with which electrons can migrate about the system, dictated to a large extent by the conductivity of the support employed. The lower activity observed over the Au-Pd/C catalyst can be explained by the change in the redox properties of Pd, when alloyed with Au 20 ; the alloying of Au with Pd reduces the rate of the ORR on Pd sites. This hypothesis is further supported by additional testing data, which confirms that ODH on Au sites, is limited by ORR taking place on Pd sites (Extended Data Fig. 2h). Over a physical mixture of Au/C and Pd/C; as the mass of Pd/C is increased, and the mass of Au/C kept constant, a linear increase in ODH activity was observed, which could not be attributed to any direct contribution from the additional Pd or C present in the reaction. This also explains why the rate of reaction over both the monometallic Au/C catalyst and Au/C + Pd/C physical mixture is influenced by, but is not directly proportional to, O2 pressure (Extended Data Fig. 2i). Oxygen pressure is proposed to influence the rate of ORR which, consequently, impacts the observed rate of ODH. Thus, the relationship between O2 pressure and ODH activity is indirect and limited by other factors, such as electron transport (in the physical mixture) or competitive adsorption of substrate and O2 (in the monometallic Au catalyst). It should however be noted that this enhancement, as O2 pressure is increased, could be attributed to gas/liquid mass transfer, and requires further exploration.Hence, we propose a reaction scheme (Fig. 2) that explains the cooperative role of Au and Pd in alcohol and (hydrated) formyl oxidation reactions.

        <p>To confirm the critical role of the electron transfer, analogous electrocatalytic experiments were performed. The electrocatalytic oxidation of HMF is well-established and the trend observed in peak current density from cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 3a) for the Au/C, Pd/C and Au-Pd/C catalysts aligns with previous literature 21 . The trend in electrocatalytic current density across the catalysts correlates strongly with the trend in thermal catalytic rate (Extended Data Fig. 6a).To confirm the critical role of the electron transfer, analogous electrocatalytic experiments were performed.

        <p>Electron transfer between Au/C and Pd/C was demonstrated by externally short-circuiting Au/C and Pd/C electrodes together in a single-chamber cell. Under aerobic conditions (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 6c), current was measured to flow from the Au/C electrode to the Pd/C electrode. The drop in current was attributed to the mass-transfer limitation of oxygen from the solution to Pd electrode interface. The current density was near zero in the absence of HMF. A control reaction where replacing Pd/C by C, showed a drastic decrease in the current density (from 715 µA/cm 2 to 239 µA/cm 2 at 30 min;), demonstrating the critical role of Pd as a reaction partner in consuming electrons generated by HMF oxidation on Au/C. Repeated switching between nitrogen and oxygen atmosphere in the cell every 60 min led to concomitant switching of the current density between approximately 100 µA/cm 2 and 600 µA/cm 2 (Fig. 3b), demonstrating the essential role of oxygen in the electrocatalytic reaction.Electron transfer between Au/C and Pd/C was demonstrated by externally short-circuiting Au/C and Pd/C electrodes together in a single-chamber cell.

        <p>Linear sweep voltammetry of Au/C and Pd/C electrodes under oxygen within the potential window reported for the ORR 22 was performed in the absence and presence of HMF (Fig. 3c).Linear sweep voltammetry of Au/C and Pd/C electrodes under oxygen within the potential window reported for the ORR 22 was performed in the absence and presence of HMF (Fig. 3c).</p>
        <p>In the absence of HMF, both Pd and Au showed clear reduction peaks at 0.72 V, attributable to the ORR. However, the ORR peak current of Au/C decreased substantially in the presence of HMF, but that of Pd/C was largely unaffected. This suggests that under reaction conditions the Au sites predominantly catalyse dehydrogenation, whereas Pd sites continue to catalyse oxygen reduction. The mechanistic role of electron transfer between the metals was further demonstrated using a dual chamber electrochemical cell where the Au/C and Pd/C electrodes were physically separated by an anion exchange membrane, but electrically connected via an external circuit, with Au and Pd electrodes under an atmosphere of N2 and O2, respectively (Figs. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 6d). The short-circuit current between the electrodes was measured over time while monitoring the HMF conversion and selectivity in the Au/C chamber. The total molar electron transfer between the electrodes was then compared with that Interestingly, the activity of a material possessing spatially separated Au and Pd nanoparticles on the same support grain for HMF ODH (denoted Au=Pd/C with morphology confirmed by STEM-XEDS, Extended Data Fig. 7) was identical to that of the physical mixture, an effect we consider is due to the highly conducting nature of the carbon support as demonstrated in the experiments where we have added additional carbon (Fig. 1e) As we concluded that spatially separating the Au and Pd provides the origin of the rate enhancement, we reasoned that synthesizing nanoparticles comprising phase separated Au and Pd regions within single nanoparticles, i.e. not alloyed, would provide an even greater rate enhancement. We therefore synthesised small clusters of Pd situated on the surface of Au nanoparticles (Janus-like nanoparticles) denoted Au@Pd/C (Figs. 4j-l). This is evidenced through comparison with micrographs of the Au/C catalyst (Figs. 4a-c) and is in stark contrast to the particles present in the alloyed Au-Pd/C catalyst (Figs. 4g-i). The material was evaluated in the thermocatalytic reactions (Figs. 1a, 1b and1c) and probed by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 3a). In both cases, increased activity was observed, as predicted by our proposed model.In the absence of HMF, both Pd and Au showed clear reduction peaks at 0.72 V, attributable to the ORR.

        <p>The validity of this concept was further evidenced when performance of the Au@Pd/C catalyst and a physical mixture of Au/C and Pd/C catalysts was assessed over multiple uses. For the Au@Pd/C sample we noted a slight loss in activity after use, which we consider was due to the formation of some surface AuPd alloy (Extended Data Fig. 8), which correlated with a decrease in catalytic activity over subsequent uses (Extended Data Figs. 9 a, b). Analogous STEM-XEDS analysis of the used Au/C + Pd/C sample after reaction as a physical mixture, confirmed that there was no detectable metal migration or alloying (Extended Data Fig. 4). This correlated with the reactivity data as the performance of the Au/C + Pd/C physical mixture remained stable over three uses (Extended Data Figs. 9 c,d). The loss of catalytic activity with the formation of some alloy in the Au@Pd/C sample after several uses further strengthens our view of the role of Au in inhibiting the redox properties of Pd; as a higher proportion of Pd becomes alloyed with Au, the rate of the Pd redox cycle would also be diminished and hence its activity for the ORR.The validity of this concept was further evidenced when performance of the Au@Pd/C catalyst and a physical mixture of Au/C and Pd/C catalysts was assessed over multiple uses.

        <p>It would appear that by removing the need for electron transfer to occur through the carbon support, thus reducing any potential resistance, the reactivity of towards ODH on the Au sites could be further increased. However, it should be noted that, in general, the Pd particles present in the Au@Pd/C catalyst are smaller than those present in the analogous Pd/C catalyst (extended data Fig7d). Whilst we suspect these smaller Pd particles would provide less of a contribution towards direct ODH, it's likely that the change in particle size would also influence ORR rate, which we have confirmed to be rate limiting for ODH (extended data Fig. 2h).It would appear that by removing the need for electron transfer to occur through the carbon support, thus reducing any potential resistance, the reactivity of towards ODH on the Au sites could be further increased.

        <p>While we recognize that there are some mechanistic features that we have not yet fully addressed, we consider that for the oxidations described the active sites on the Au and Pd nanoparticles work through redox cooperation. This CORE effect, controlled largely by electron transfer, as opposed to molecular transport, is a wholly new observation in heterogeneous catalysis and requires a conductive support; the electrochemical experiments are consistent with this view. We propose that the rate of the Pd redox cycle and ease with which electrons can migrate about the system ultimately dictates the intrinsic catalytic activity observed. For HMF oxidation, the primary model reaction studied, our Au@Pd/C catalyst is among the most active reported to date (Extended data Table 1). We consider that the discovery of CORE effects will provide an additional dimension to research into bimetallic catalysts and provides a new foundation for the development of multi-component heterogeneous catalysts.While we recognize that there are some mechanistic features that we have not yet fully addressed, we consider that for the oxidations described the active sites on the Au and Pd nanoparticles work through redox cooperation.

We propose that the rate of the Pd redox cycle and ease with which electrons can migrate about the system ultimately dictates the intrinsic catalytic activity observed. For HMF oxidation, the primary model reaction studied, our Au@Pd/C catalyst is among the most active reported to date (Extended data Table 1). We consider that the discovery of CORE effects will provide an additional dimension to research into bimetallic catalysts and provides a new foundation for the development of multi-component heterogeneous catalysts.</p>

        <p>Synthesis of the 1 wt.% Au@Pd/C catalyst by sol-immobilization. The procedure used for the synthesis of this material is similar to that listed in the previous section. However, for the synthesis of this catalyst, Au and Pd colloids were prepared separately. The metal precursors were combined with analogous quantities of PVA and reduced with an analogous quantity of NaBH4, in separate beakers. Once the colloids had been synthesized, they were combined into one beaker and the desired quantity of support is immediately added. After 30 min, the solid catalyst was recovered by filtration and washed repeatedly with 500 mL distilled water to remove Na + , BH -4 and BO -2.

        <p>Testing of catalysts in thermocatalytic experiments. The majority of the thermocatalytic testing in this work utilized HMF as the substrate. HMF oxidation was carried out in a glass Colaver reactor (50 mL). In a typical reaction, an aqueous solution (16 mL) consisting of HMF (0.1 M) and NaHCO3 (0.4 M) was heated to 80 ˚C under constant stirring (1000 rpm). After temperature stabilization was achieved, the catalyst(s) (HMF/metal=200/1, mol/mol) was added and the reactor was purged with O2 five times before the reaction was typically run for 2 h. The reaction was conducted under atmosphere of 3 bar O2, this was continually fed in a semi-batch manner to maintain a constant head pressure in the reactor. Re-use experiments were also conducted for some of the catalysts. For this, the catalyst was removed and washed with deionised water (500 mL) and acetone (250 mL) after each experiment, dried at 110 °C for 16 h before being re-used in the experiment. Analyses and quantification of post reaction solutions was carried out using a high-performance liquid chromatography (Agilent Technologies 1200 series) equipped with a diode array detector. A Hi-Plex H (300 x 7.7 mm) column was used to separate the products with 5 mM aqueous H2SO4 solution as the mobile phase, at a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min. The conversion of HMF and the yield of each product were obtained directly using calibration curves of known concentrations.Testing of catalysts in thermocatalytic experiments.
