        <p>Strong second-harmonic generation (SHG) and a wide bandgap are two crucial but often conflicting parameters that must be optimized for practical nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. We report herein the first example of a d 0 -TM tellurite where half of the d 0 -transition-metal octahedra are partially fluorinated, namely RbTeMo2O8F, which exhibits giant SHG responses (27 times that of KH2PO4 (KDP) and 2.2 times of KTiOPO4 (KTP) with 1064 and 2100 nm laser radiation, respectively), the largest SHG values among all reported metal tellurites. RbTeMo2O8F also possesses a large bandgap (3.63 eV), a wide optical transparency window (0.34-5.40 µm), and a significant birefringence (Δn: 0.263 at 546 nm). Theoretical calculations and crystal structure analysis demonstrate that the outstanding SHG responses can be definitively attributed to the uniform alignment of the polarized [MoO6]/[MoO5F] octahedra and the seesaw-like [TeO4], and the consequent favorable summative polarization of the three distinct SHG-active polyhedra, both induced by partial fluorine substitution on the [MoO6] octahedra.</p>
        <p>Nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are a key component for switching laser sources to new spectral regions through frequency-conversion technology. 1,2 Mid-infrared (mid-IR, 3-5 μm) lasers are essential for applications in many fields, such as medical treatment, military communication, and laser lithography. [3][4][5] Chalcogenides AgGaS2 (AGS) and AgGaSe2, and pnictide ZnGeP2 (ZGP) are well-known mid-IR NLO crystals 6 due to their superior IR transparency and second-harmonic generation (SHG) effect. Unfortunately, inherent drawbacks such as relatively narrow band gaps, low laser damage thresholds (LDTs), two-photon absorption, and/or non-phase matchability greatly limit their practical NLO applications. 7 As a result, the development of new mid-IR NLO materials with both a strong SHG effect and a wide band gap is of significant academic and commercial interest. [7][8][9] Metal oxides based on lone-pair oxyanions, including iodates, [10][11][12] selenites, 13,14 and tellurites, 15,16 have been a focus of NLO materials research, because they usually exhibit a large bandgap, a wide optical transparency range, and ease of crystal growth. However, the SHG efficiencies of most lone-pair oxyanion-based oxides lacking additional NLO-active structural units are not demonstrably superior to those of commercialized mid-IR chalcogenides. d 0 -Transition metal (TM)-centered polyhedra susceptible to second-order Jahn-Teller (SOJT) distortions 17,18 have been introduced into lone-pair oxyanion-based oxide systems to enhance their SHG efficiency, examples including Li2Ti(IO3)6 (SHG efficiency 500 × α-SiO2, band gap 3.00 eV), 19 K(VO)2O2(IO3)3 (3.6 × KTiOPO4 (KTP), 2.30 eV), 20 Cs2(MoO3)3(SeO3) (350 × α-SiO2, 3.10 eV), 21 Cs2TeMo3O12 (400 × α-SiO2, 2.88 eV), 22 BaTeMo2O9 (600 × α-SiO2, 3.26 eV) 23 and BaTeW2O9 (500 × α-SiO2, 3.42 eV). 23 Despite these successes, the incorporation of multiple TM-centered units to construct efficient NLO oxides simultaneously possessing strong SHG effects (&gt; 10 × KH2PO4 (KDP) 24,25 and large band gaps (&gt; 3.5 eV) is thus far underexploited because of the unfavorable arrangements of multiple SHG-active groups and/or undesirable electronic transitions of the d 0 -TM cations. 26 Correlations between the molecular structures and NLO properties of SHG oxide crystals have revealed the subtle influence of the composition, arrangement, and packing configuration of the SHG-active units on linear optical and NLO performance. In particular, the introduction of polarizing elements 27 may favor both the construction of highly polarizable structural units and the enhancement of the optical bandgap. In the present study, we propose a partial fluorine substitution strategy to increase structural distortion of lone-pair oxyanion-based TM oxides. Replacing one oxygen site in half of the d 0 -TM centered octahedra with more highly electronegative fluorine may induce significant differences in the band structures and, by this means, potentially improve the bandgaps and SHG responses. 19,28 In addition, the fluorine may act as a structure directing agent, 29 aligning the asymmetric metaloxyfluoride units preferentially in one direction, and thereby forming a macroscopic polar compound, for which optimized SHG efficiency may be achieved by stacking the discrete NLO-active structural units in an additive mode. Following this strategy, the first example of a d 0 -TM tellurite where half of the d 0 -transitionmetal octahedra are partially fluorinated, namely RbTeMo2O8F, has been constructed, which exhibits giant SHG responses in both the visible (27 × KDP @ 1064 nm) and IR (2.2 × KTP @ 2100 nm) spectral ranges, as well as a large band gap (3.63 eV), a sufficient birefringence (0.263 @ 546 nm) for phase-matching, and a wide optical transparency range covering the important mid-IR (3-5 μm) window. Herein, we report its synthesis, crystal structure, linear and nonlinear optical properties, and computational studies to rationalize its excellent optical performance.</p>
        <p>Single crystals of RbTeMo2O8F were synthesized via the hydrothermal method from a mixture of Rb2CO3, MoO3, TeO2, hydrofluoric acid, and deionized water (see Supporting Information for details). The purity of the crystalline sample was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) (Figure S1). The Rb, Mo, Te, and F content of the crystal was confirmed by microprobe energydispersive spectroscopy (EDS) (Figure S2). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicates that RbTeMo2O8F is thermally stable up to 758 °C (Figure S3).</p>
        <p>RbTeMo2O8F crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric space group Pn (no. 7) (Tables S1-S3). Unlike the previously reported fluorine-free molybdenum tellurites, RbMo2TeO8F features a unique two-dimensional (2D) layered structure [Mo2O4F(TeO4)] that is composed of [MoO6] and the distinctive [MoO5F] octahedra and [TeO4] units, and with Rb + serving as the counter cations for charge balance (Figure 1c). It is noteworthy that the Mo 6+ cations adopt two types of six-coordinate environments ([Mo(1)O5F] and [Mo(2)O6]), with a wide range of Mo-O/F bond distances [1.696(5)-2.443(6) Å] (Figure 1a). The Te 4+ cation exhibits a seesaw-like geometry with three normal Te-O bonds varying from 1.891(5) to 1.948(5) Å and one elongated Te-O bond (2.328(5) Å). Both Mo 6+ and Te 4+ cations are in asymmetric coordination environments attributable to SOJT effects. Each Rb + cation is 12-coordinated with one F atom and eleven O atoms (Figure S4). The Rb-O bonds range from 2.884(6) to 3.596(6) Å and the Rb-F bond is 2.778(4) Å. Bond valence sum (BVS) calculations reveal BVS values of 6.05-6.13 and 3.851 for Mo and Te, respectively, consistent with the coordination environments and anticipated formal oxidation states of the Mo and Te atoms.</p>
        <p>From the viewpoint of structural evolution, RbTeMo2O8F possesses a similar layered structure to that of BaTeMo2O9, 23 but one in which half of the [MoO6] units in the [Mo2O9]∞ layers of BaTeMo2O9 are replaced by partially fluorinated [MoO5F] octahedra (Figures 1b and1e). The main difference between the two layered structures can be attributed to this partial introduction of fluorine atoms at the terminal sites of the [MoO6] octahedra. As a result, the structure of quinary RbTeMo2O8F exhibits the following crucial differences to that of quaternary BaTeMo2O9: (i) The partial substitution of oxygen atoms with the strongly electronegative fluorine increases the bandgap remarkably from 3.12 to 3.63 eV (Table 1), which can be attributed to the increased ionicity of the Mo-F bonds. 19 1d), a differing arrangement to that of BaTeMo2O9 (Figure 1f). This ordered arrangement should be immensely beneficial for enhancing the SHG response. (iv) The edge-sharing connection between the [TeO4] and [MoO6]/[MoO5F] polyhedra favors the formation of a highly condensed layered-structure. All of these structural characteristics of the polar RbTeMo2O8F contribute to the resultant favorable arrangement of all three NLO-active units, and thereby promote a large net macroscopic polarization and SHG response. Dipole moment calculations 32 of RbTeMo2O8F and BaTeMo2O9 were undertaken to evaluate the polarization of the constituent groups. As shown in Table S4, the calculated dipole moment of [MoO6] is larger than that of [MoO5F], which is in agreement with the out-of-center distortion calculation above. The magnitude of the dipole moment of a single [TeO4] polyhedron (11.11 D) in RbTeMo2O8F is close to that of a single [TeO4] polyhedron (11.09 D) in BaTeMo2O9. However, RbTeMo2O8F exhibits a net dipole moment (13.32 D) two-fold greater than that of BaTeMo2O9 (5.50 D). This is consistent with the observation above that the Te 4+ lone-pair electrons are aligned in RbTeMo2O8F, while the dipole moments of the [TeO4] polyhedra are nearly antiparallel in BaTeMo2O9. The distinctly different arrangements of these key SHG-active units contribute to the considerably larger SHG response of RbTeMo2O8F than that of BaTeMo2O9.</p>
        <p>The IR spectrum (Figure S5) and UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectrum (Figure S6) of RbTeMo2O8F showed a wide transparent region (ca. 0.34-5.40 μm), covering the visible and important mid-IR atmospheric transparency windows</p>

        <p>(3-5 μm). UV-Vis-NIR measurements revealed an absorption cutoff wavelength of 342 nm, corresponding to a wide bandgap of 3.63 eV. This value is not only significantly larger than that of the commercial IR NLO crystals AgGaS2 (2.62 eV), 6 AgGaSe2 (1.83 eV), 6 and ZnGeP2 (1.99 eV), 6 but also larger than that of many excellent tellurites with [TeO4] groups (Table 1).</p>
        <p>According to the SHG measurement results (Figure 2), RbTeMo2O8F exhibits a phase-matchable tendency towards both 1064 and 2100 nm radiation, and displays giant SHG responses of 27 × KDP (@ 1064 nm) and 2.2 × KTP (@ 2100 nm) in the 105-150 μm particle size range. These values are significantly larger than that of BaTeMo2O9 (600 × α-SiO2) 24 and are the largest values of all reported tellurites (Table 1). The birefringence of RbTeMo2O8F was measured on a selected single crystal using a ZEISS Axio A1 polarizing microscope. The crystal achieved complete extinction when the retardation value reached ca. 11.64 μm with a measured thickness of 44.2 μm (Figure S7); the birefringence was calculated to be 0.263 at 546 nm, sufficient to realize phase matchability.</p>
        <p>The linear optical and NLO properties were further investigated by theoretical means. The electronic structure is depicted in Under the restriction of Kleinman symmetry, RbTeMo2O8F has six independent SHG tensors (d11, d12, d13, d15, d24, and d33), which are listed in Table S4. The largest SHG coefficient (d15: 9.40 pm/V) was calculated to be 24 times that of KDP, which is consistent with the experimental powder SHG response. To shed further light on the significance of the RbTeMo2O8F structure for its exceptional SHG properties, a real-space atom-cutting analysis was performed. The largest SHG component d15 is mostly attributed to the [MoO6] (25.3%), [MoO5F] (42.2%) and [TeO4] (29.7%) groups while the alkali metal cation Rb + contributes little. The origin of the SHG effect was further investigated by performing an SHG-weighted electron density analysis (Figures 3c and3d</p>
