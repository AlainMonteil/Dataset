        <p>Initial reports from the 1960s describing the observations of ultrasound contrast enhancement by tiny gaseous bubbles during echocardiographic examinations prompted the development of the first ultrasound contrast agent in the 1980s. Current commercial contrast agents for echography, such as Definity, Optison, Sonazoid and SonoVue, have proven to be successful in a variety of on-and off-label clinical indications. Whereas contrast-specific technology has seen dramatic progress after the introduction of the first approved agents in the 1990s, successful clinical translation of new developments has been limited during the same period, while understanding of microbubble physical, chemical and biologic behavior has improved substantially. It is expected that for a successful development of future opportunities, such as ultrasound molecular imaging and therapeutic applications using microbubbles, new creative developments in microbubble engineering and production dedicated to further optimizing microbubble performance are required, and that they cannot rely on bubble technology developed more than 3 decades ago.</p>
        <p>The diagnostic applications of ultrasound imaging have been expanded enormously during the last few decades. With the introduction of ultrasound contrast agents (UCA), new meaningful physiologic and pathologic information is provided, and perfusion imaging of myocardial or tumor tissue has now become available for routine clinical decision making. The first observations of the ultrasonic contrast effect date from the mid-1960s to work by Joyner (Gramiak and Shah 1968). Indeed, contrast echocardiography started when it was noted by Gramiak et al. (1969) that the intracardiac injection of indocyanine green dye, a frequently used substance for measuring blood flow, produced a "cloud of echoes" on the M-mode echocardiogram (Gramiak and Shah 1968). In fact, it was shown that the injection of almost any liquid through a small-bore needle or catheter would produce this contrast effect (Kremkau et al. 1968;Kremkau et al. 1970).</p>
        <p>The effect was referred to as a cloud of echoes although investigators speculated that the phenomenon was owing to the presence of tiny gas bubbles suspended in the liquid (Bove et al. 1968;Ziskin et al. 1972;Barrera et al. 1978). Nevertheless, this correct hypothesis was still challenged, and others suggested that particulate matter caused the ultrasound contrast (Schuchman et al. 1975). Metlzer et al. (1980) provided evidence on this subject and demonstrated, by examining fluids before and after hand agitation employing two syringes connected by a three-way stopcock, that the microbubbles used for peripheral contrast echocardiography were formed during this agitation and thus were already present in the injectant rather than being formed at the catheter tip during injection.</p>
        <p>Although free gas bubbles could be generated in any liquid, it was observed that in indocyanine green dye and gelatin microbubble persistence increased, improving contrast enhancement (Meltzer et al. 1980;Carroll et al. 1980). It was concluded that these liquids act as surfactants, decreasing the surface tension to values lower than that of a clean saline-air interface, thereby stabilizing the free gas bubbles against rapid dissolution. Moreover, the surfactants prevented bubbles from coalescing, minimizing the creation of large and potentially dangerous bubble sizes (Metlzer et al. 1980). Nevertheless, free gas bubbles produced by hand agitation of saline are sometimes still being used in echocardiography for detecting intracardiac shunts.</p>
        <p>In the period between 1970À1980, the field of contrast echography evolved further and mainly focused on a wide variety of applications in cardiology such as identification of cardiac structures and cavity dimensions (Roelandt 1982), detection of intracardiac shunts (Valdes-Cruz and Sahn 1984), visualization of blood flow in M-mode, detection of valvular regurgitation (Kerber et al. 1974;Reid et al. 1983), analysis of complex congenital heart disease and cardiac output determination by indicator dilution curves (Meltzer and Roelandt 1982). However, the full potential of contrast echography could still not be explored because of inherent shortcomings of free gaseous microbubbles, such as very short lifetime and low persistence, indeterminate size and inability to pass through the lung circulation after an intravenous injection. Nevertheless, the expectation and confidence in this new modality was very strong, as is illustrated by the following passage from Contrast Echocardiography edited by Meltzer and Roelandt (1982):</p>
        <p>The future of contrast echocardiography is almost unlimited. As this book indicates, there is a vast amount of interest and research currently being done with regards to contrast echocardiography. Probably the most exciting aspect of this research is the development of new contrast producing agents. It is going to be exciting to see how these various agents develop. Hopefully, one or more of these new agents will be able to traverse the capillaries so that one can visualize the left side of the heart with a peripheral venous injection. This passage also illustrates the awareness of the limitations at that time, and it took more than a decade to develop the first commercial contrast agent for imaging the left ventricle (LV) of the heart.</p>
        <p>From 1980, extensive research was performed in order to make contrast echocardiography an established diagnostic technique (Senior et al. 2017). In 1989, Ophir and Parker (1989) summarized the use of UCA in medical imaging. Five types of agents with different physical properties were classified: free gas bubbles, encapsulated gas bubbles, colloidal suspensions, emulsions and aqueous solutions. In those days, it was still a main challenge to produce the "ideal" contrast agent, which would meet the following criteria: Distribution of the agent within the heart chamber or myocardium representative of local blood flow; Stability of the agent to persist during an imaging examination after an intravenous injection; Consisting of microbubbles smaller than 8 mm in diameter (smaller than red blood cells) enabling passage through the pulmonary system and the smallest capillaries of the body; Physiologically inert, excellent safety profile; Echogenic, strong and controlled acoustic interaction.</p>
        <p>The challenge of producing stable encapsulated microbubbles surviving passage through the heart and the pulmonary capillary network was first resolved in 1984 (Feinstein et al. 1984), when microbubbles were produced by cavitation after introducing the tip of a sonicator horn into a solution of human serum albumin. These microbubbles could be visualized in the left heart after a peripheral venous injection. During the 1990s, research on gaseous microbubbles as an UCA became very active, and numerous manufacturers started to develop new microbubblebased contrast agents that met most of the criteria listed above. Several technologies for stabilizing the microbubbles were investigated. Thin shells made of protein, polymer or phospholipids were used to reduce surface tension and stabilize the gas core against rapid dissolution. However, the first-generation agents still suffered from limited stability and very short circulation time because of the high solubility of air in water. Persistence during circulation was dramatically improved by replacing air by perfluorinated gases with a low solubility in water, such as sulphur hexafluoride (Schneider et al. 1995), perfluoropropane (Unger et al. 1994) or perfluorobutane (Schneider et al. 1997;Schneider et al. 2011), resulting in a persistence of the agent in the blood circulation sufficient for clinical use. At the end of the decade, more than 15 different agents were at various stages of development. Table 1 summarizes a non-exhaustive list of agents in development for intravenous application at that time (Kasparzak and Ten Cate 1998;Becher and Burns 2000;Stride and Saffari 2003;Quaia 2005;Faez et al. 2013;Chang 2018).</p>
        <p>The introduction of the first microbubbles satisfying most criteria required for an intravenous UCA also prompted tremendous research efforts by clinicians, scientists and ultrasound equipment manufacturers to describe the physical phenomena and to translate the knowledge into clinical applications. For example, theoretical expressions for cavitation (Atchley and Crum 1988), the mechanism used for describing the cloud of echoes observed in the beginning on M-mode echocardiograms, proved to be very useful for understanding the interaction between ultrasound waves and gaseous microbubbles. Particularly, the high compressibility of the gas core appearde to be important, since it results in frequency-dependent volume pulsations with a pronounced maximum at the resonance frequency, with the resonance frequency being inversely proportional to the microbubble size (Minnaert 1933;Medwin 1977). Fortunately, the range of microbubble sizes appropriate for clinical use have resonance frequencies on the order of 1À15 MHz, right in the frequency range commonly used in diagnostic ultrasound (Mulvana et al. 2017). Moreover, a resonating bubble behaves as a source of sound rather than as a passive scatterer, yielding an enhancement of particularly non-linear echo signals.</p>
        <p>The non-linear echoes produced by gaseous microbubbles stem from intrinsic non-linearities in the Rayleigh-Plesset equation. However, for stabilized microbubbles, the presence of the encapsulating shell substantially affects the volumetric microbubble oscillation amplitude, and the viscoelastic properties of the shell strongly alter its resonance behavior. It has been observed that because of the presence of the shell, encapsulated gas bubbles can be up to 20 times more rigid than free gas bubbles, substantially increasing the resonance frequency. Moreover, because of shell viscosity, bubble oscillations are heavily damped, attenuating the propagating ultrasound wave and thus limiting acoustic penetration depth (de Jong and Hoff 1993;Church 1995;Sontum et al. 1999;Hoff et al. 2000;Sarkar et al. 2005). Since early-to mid-2000, Rayleigh-PlessetÀtype models including non-linear shell elasticity and viscosity terms were developed (Marmottant et al. 2005;Stride 2008;Tsiglifis and Pelekasis 2008;Paul et al. 2010;Katiyar and Sarkar 2011), predicting the non-linear dynamics of an oscillating microbubble particularly owing to the presence of the stabilizing shell. Excellent reviews on contrast agent modelling are given by Doinikov and Bouakaz (2011) and Faez et al. (2013).</p>
        <p>The non-linear dynamics of stabilized oscillating microbubbles includes "compression only behavior," an asymmetric oscillation where a microbubble compresses more than it expands, which was observed experimentally by de Jong et al. ( 2007) using high-speed imaging. Compression-only results from the non-linear surface tension of an encapsulated microbubble with an equilibrium surface tension close to zero. During compression, the microbubble reaches the tensionless buckling state, whereas volumetric expansions are counteracted by the finite shell elasticity once the bubble reaches the elastic state (Marmottant 2005, Marmottant et al. 2011). Another observation resulting from shell non-linearity, initially described as thresholding (Emmer et al. 2007), appeared to be related to a downshift in the resonance frequency with increasing acoustic pressure at low amplitudes (Overvelde et al. 2010). Others related this behavior to strain softening of the shell (Tsiglifis and Pelekasis 2008;Paul et al. 2010). In fact, the downshift in resonance frequency results from an effective averaging of the shell stiffness over elastic and non-elastic regions, where the elastic region is limited to a relatively narrow microbubble surface area range around the equilibrium bubble area. Thus, the non-linear response of encapsulated microbubbles already appears at very low acoustic pressure amplitudes (e.g., lower than 50 kPa). Higher acoustic pressure amplitudes can result in microbubble destruction and fragmentation. When higher acoustic pressures are applied (e.g., 100À150 kPa for soft-shelled microbubbles and higher than 300 kPa for hard-shelled microbubbles), the shell ruptures transiently and releases free gas bubbles (Frinking et al. 1999), which can rapidly dissolve in the surrounding liquid. This can generate an abrupt increase of the non-linear harmonics in the backscattered signal, which is a very sensitive way for detecting microbubbles during contrastenhanced imaging.</p>
        <p>In parallel with the developments of UCA, and because of the improved understanding of non-linear microbubble behavior, specific microbubble imaging modes were developed, and these are currently implemented in most clinical ultrasound systems (Burns et al. 1996;Wei et al. 1998;Hope Simpson et al. 1999). The contrast-specific imaging modes take advantage of non-linear acoustic properties of gas bubbles very different from those of tissue (Frinking et al. 2000;Rafter et al. 2004). Particularly, the non-linear shell behavior explains the success of low mechanical index (MI) (&lt;0.1) contrast-specific imaging mostly used for real-time perfusion and intra-cavitary assessments. Additionally, several diagnostic imaging techniques and/or quantification methods (e.g., harmonic power Doppler, destruction-replenishment imaging) are based on the unique and very sensitive property of microbubble destruction when short pulse excitations at higher MI are applied (Blomley et al. 1999;Albrecht et al. 2003). Integration of these bubble-specific signatures in combination with excellent tissue suppression algorithms in imaging systems resulted eventually in broad clinical acceptance of contrastenhanced ultrasound imaging as a diagnostic mode, particularly outside cardiology, with equivalent or even superior clinical performance compared with other contrastenhanced modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) (Lu et al. 2007;Meloni et al. 2008;Sidhu et al. 2018).</p>
        <p>Most of the agents initially developed for intravenous use are listed in Table 1, and from those reaching clinical approval during the last 3 decades (Table 2), only four are currently marketed and used in routine clinical practice. Three of these agents are phospholipidshelled agents (SonoVue, Definity, Sonazoid) and one is an albumin-shelled agent (Optison). The formulations, physico-chemical properties, clinical applications and new development of these agents are described in further detail below and summarized in Tables 3 and4.</p>
        <p>Optison (perflutren protein-type A microspheres injectable suspension) (USP, GE Healthcare, AS, Oslo, Norway) is a sterile non-pyrogenic suspension consisting of microspheres with a perflutren (Octafluoropropane) gas core encapsulated by a 15 nm thick human serum albumin</p>
        <p>Review of Ultrasound Contrast Agents P. FRINKING et al.</p>
        <p>Optison is by gentle hand mixing, and the concentration of the reconstituted suspension is 5.0À8.0 £ 10 8 microspheres/mL with an average diameter of 3.0À4.5 mm, and 95% of microspheres are smaller than 10 mm. The acoustical characteristics of Optison were investigated previously, and both mathematical modelling and experimental measurements were utilized (Church 1995;Podell et al. 1999;Bing et al. 2018). The albumin shell rigidity of 88.8 MPa and a shell shear viscosity of 0.177 N s/m 2 were derived, by assuming the shell as a continuous surface layer of incompressible solid elastic material and by accounting for damping provided by the shell viscosity. Based on data for Albunex (de Jong and Hoff 1993), the air-based predecessor of Optison, values for shell elasticity and dilational viscosity can be estimated as 4 N/m and 3.2 £ 10 À8 kg/s, respectively (Morgan et al. 2000;Forbes and O'Brien 2012). In vitro measurements indicated that the destruction (or gas dissolution) pressure threshold for rapid destruction of Optison was 0.47 MPa (peak-negative pressure) when exposed to 3.5-MHz ultrasound (Podell et al. 1999), while a lower threshold was found to contribute to accelerated dissolution (Porter et al. 2006). The flexible and robust characteristics of the albumin shell make Optison an effective ultrasound scatterer, while it can be resilient to destruction in clinical use.</p>
        <p>Optison was launched as the first of the second-generation of UCA in the North American market in January 1998 and in Europe in May of the same year (Jackson et al. 2016). It is indicated for use in patients with suboptimal echocardiograms to opacify the LV and to improve the delineation of left ventricular endocardial borders (Fig. 1). Off-label use of Optison was reported, including stress echocardiography of patients with suboptimal baseline echocardiograms (Dolan et al. 2001(Dolan et al. , 2009;;Dawson et al. 2009), as well as its non-cardiac clinical applications in liver imaging (i.e., for monitoring the evolving necrosis during thermoablation of liver tumors [Jung et al. 2003]), and it was reported in pediatric patients, such as for the assessment of solid pediatric tumors (McCarville et al. 2012) and detection of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children (Ntoulia et al. 2018).</p>
        <p>During clinical imaging, Optison can be administered intravenously as either a bolus (0.3À0.5 mL) with a slow rate (not exceeding 1 mL/s) or continuous infusion (10% dilution, 3À5 mL/min). This should be followed by 5À10 mL saline flushes over 10 s to avoid acoustic shadowing and permit steady-state concentration of microbubbles during image acquisition. The recommended Optison dose is 0.5À3.0 mL per patient, with the duration of the left-ventricular contrast of 2.5À4.5 min. A low MI (MI lower than 0.2) in clinical imaging is recommended to avoid microbubble destruction (Porter et al. 2018).</p>
        <p>Definity (USA) or Luminity (EU) (perflutren lipid microspheres) (Lantheus Medical Imaging Inc, North Billerica, MA, USA) injectable suspension is supplied as a single-use 2 mL glass vial containing a clear liquid and octafluoropropane (C 3 F 8 ) gas in the head space. The liquid contains a solution with the three phospholipids DPPC (1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), DPPA (1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate, sodium salt) and DPPE-MPEG5000. The product is prepared by emulsification activation using a mechanical shaking device (Vialmix) Lantheus Medical Imaging Inc, North Billerica, MA, USA) for 45 s. After activation, a 1 mL milky-white liquid suspension is obtained containing 84.0 § 11.1 £ 10 8 microspheres/mL (44.0 mL/mL volume concentration) with the number mean diameter of 1.22 § 0.03 mm and volume median diameter of 8.19 § 0.77 mm (Hyvelin et al. 2017). The viscoelastic shell properties for Definity microbubbles have been estimated at high (12À29 MHz) and at low (5À15 MHz) ultrasound frequencies (Goertz et al. 2007, Faez et al. 2011). At the lower frequencies, values corresponding to 0.82 N/m for the shell elasticity and 4.0 £ 10 À9 kg/s for dilational viscosity have been reported (Faez et al. 2011) The pharmacokinetics of an intravenous dose of activated Definity was evaluated in healthy humans and those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The perflutren gas is cleared by the lungs in the expired air in an unchanged state. The rapid elimination of perflutren gas in the expired air was also consistent with the rapid disappearance of ultrasound contrast enhancement after activated Definity administration (Abdelmoneim and Mulvagh 2012).</p>
        <p>Beyond enhanced endocardial visualization, Definity is used for quantification of LV volumes and ejection fraction (Mulvagh et al. 2008). Moreover, the diagnoses of apical LV pathology (e.g., apical variant of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and thrombus), postÀmyocardial infarction complications (e. g., LV rupture or pseudoaneurysm, or ventricular septal defect) and intracardiac masses (Porter et al. 2014) are significantly enhanced (Fig. 2). In addition to its cardiac indications, Definity is also approved for imaging of the liver and kidney in Canada and Australia. Several studies have shown its efficacy in evaluation of liver lesions as a vascular phase agent (Claudon et al. 2013).</p>
        <p>As mentioned by Abdelmoneim and Mulvagh (2012), off-label use of Definity has been reported for the use with stress echocardiography improving the diagnostic accuracy of stress echo in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (Moir et al. 2004;Tsutsui et al. 2005;Plana et al. 2008;Dolan et al. 2009) primarily to identify wall motion abnormalities in clinically indicated stress echo studies. Moreover, a growing number of published articles have documented the use of Definity for the assessment of myocardial perfusion to detect perfusion abnormalities both at rest and in conjunction with exercise and pharmacologic stress echocardiography (Abdelmoneim et al. 2009a(Abdelmoneim et al. , 2009b)).</p>
        <p>SonoVue (sulphur hexafluoride [SF 6 ] microbubbles) (Bracco Imaging S.p.A., Colleretto Giacosa, Italy) or Lumason (sulphur hexafluoride lipid-type A microspheres) (Bracco Diagnostics Inc., Monroe Township, NJ, USA), is supplied as a kit containing a single-use septum-sealed vial of phospholipid lyophilized powder and SF 6 headspace, a pre-filled syringe with 5 mL sodium chloride 0.9% injection (diluent) and a mini-spike transfer system (Hyvelin et al. 2017). The lyophilizate consists of polyethylene glycol 4000 and phospholipids DSPC (1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphocholine) and DPPG (1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphoglycerol, sodium salt) (Schneider et al. 1995). The product is prepared by reconstitution of the lyophilized cake and by shaking the vial for 20 s to obtain a homogenous milky-white suspension of microbubbles, which can be stored for up to 6 h. After reconstitution, the product contains approximately 3.4 § 0.5 £ 10 8 microspheres/mL (6.5 mL/ mL volume concentration) with the number mean diameter of 1.9 § 0.1 mm and volume median diameter of 8.0 § 0.9 mm (Hyvelin et al. 2017).</p>
        <p>SonoVue is mostly administered as intravenous bolus injection followed by a 5À10 mL saline flush and should be gently agitated before administration. The clinical dose recommended for a single injection is 34 mL/kg (i.e., 2.4 mL for a 70 kg person) (Hyvelin et al. 2017); however, the optimal dose may depend on the individual patient and possibly on the scanner technology used. Repeated injection is possible, but in some situations, it is preferred to extend the examination under steady-state conditions (e.g., to prolong the duration of hepatic parenchymal enhancement [Quaia et al. 2016] or for measurement of blood flow parameters for assessment of oncologic response to therapy using the destruction-replenishment technique [Dietrich 2018]). For this, a dedicated infusion pump (Vueject, Bracco Imaging, Milan, Italy) with a rotating syringe holder to avoid decantation of the microbubbles has been developed. In this case, SonoVue can be administered as a continuous infusion at a rate of about 1 mL/min depending on the enhancement level required (Schneider 2002, Greis 2004).</p>
        <p>Pharmacokinetics of SonoVue was assessed in humans showing that SF 6 is rapidly removed from the blood by the pulmonary route. After intravenous injection, the microbubbles are submitted to systemic pressure variations during the cardiac cycle. The high molecular weight gas SF 6 , having a low solubility in water and blood, confers good pressure resistance to SonoVue microbubbles (Schneider et al. 1995, Bokor 2000).</p>
        <p>Acoustic properties such as attenuation, backscatter and non-linear behavior of SonoVue microbubbles have been extensively studied (Schneider et al. 1995;Gorce et al. 2000;Vandermeer et al. 2004;Biagi et al. 2007;Chetty 2008;Tu 2009). Visco-elastic shell parameter values of 0.55 N/m for the shell elasticity and 7.2 £ 10 À9 kg/s for dilational viscosity have been reported (Gorce et al. 2000, Marmottant et al. 2005), which are very similar to Definity. Moreover, de Jong et al. (2007) reported the extremely non-linear characteristic of compression-only behavior, which was observed during the first high-speed imaging recordings (Chin et al. 2003) and appeared to be a typical characteristic of shelled microbubbles. In fact, these observations motivated the development of the Marmottant model (Marmottant et al. 2005) for phospholipid-shelled microbubble dynamics and enforced the fundamental understanding of the success of low-MI contrast-specific imaging techniques in combination with SonoVue.</p>
        <p>SonoVue has clinically been approved in Europe (2001) and China (2004) for use in adult patients with suboptimal echocardiograms to opacify the left ventricular chamber and to improve the delineation of the left ventricular endocardial border, for focal liver lesion and for focal breast lesion characterization (EPAR summary for the public). In 2014, Lumason obtained approval in the United States for adult patients with suboptimal echocardiograms to opacify the left ventricular chamber and to improve the delineation of the left ventricular endocardial border; in March 2016 it was the first UCA receiving FDA approval for characterizing focal liver lesions in adult and pediatric patients (Lumason drug approval package). Recently, approval for ultrasonography of the urinary tract for the evaluation of suspected or known VUR in pediatric patients was obtained in the United States (2016), Europe (2017) and China (2018). Aside from approved indications, a wide variety of off-label use has been listed primarily for Sono-Vue in adult (Sidhu et al. 2018) and pediatric patients (Sidhu et al. 2017). Some of the most popular clinical applications of SonoVue are for the diagnosis of focal liver lesions, guidance during ablative treatment and follow-up of liver tumors (Ferraioli and Meloni 2018) (Fig. 3).</p>
        <p>Sonazoid microspheres (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK; Daiichi Sankyo, Tokyo, Japan) is a secondgeneration UCA that has been approved in Japan ( 2006), South Korea (2012), Norway (2014), Taiwan ( 2017) and mainland China (2018) for contrast-enhanced sonography of focal liver lesions. In Japan, it was approved for contrast-enhanced imaging of breast lesions in 2012.</p>
        <p>Sonazoid is formulated as a lyophilized powder for injection that consists of perfluorobutane (C 4 F 10 ) microspheres stabilized by a monomolecular membrane of hydrogenated egg yolk phosphatidyl serine (HEPS). The product is reconstituted before use with sterile water through a supplied vented filter spike (5 mm) followed by manual mixing for 1 min. After reconstitution, the product appears as a milky white, homogeneous suspension, containing approximately 1.2 § 0.1 £ 10 9 microspheres/mL (8 mL/mL volume concentration) with the number mean diameter of 2.1 § 0.1 mm and volume median diameter of 2.6 § 0.1 mm (Sontum et al. 2008). Characteristic acoustic properties of Sonazoid microbubbles were described by Katiyar and Sarkar (2011) using various models for encapsulated microbubbles. Visco-elastic shell parameter estimations obtained with the Marmottant model (Marmottant et al. 2005) resulted in values of 0.5À0.6 N/m for the shell elasticity and 1.2 £ 10 À8 À1.6 £ 10 À8 kg/s for dilational viscosity (Faez et al. 2011); the dilational viscosity is 2À3 times higher compared to SonoVue and Definity, respectively. Sonazoid is highly resistant to overpressures; pressure stress up to 300 mmHg is well tolerated by both concentrated and diluted suspensions (Sontum 2008). The composition of the suspension, physicochemical properties and visco-elastic properties of the stabilizing membrane showed a low variance from vial to vial and from batch to batch, which ensures the consistency in the biologic behavior and clinical efficacy of Sonazoid (Sontum et al. 1999;Hoff et al. 2000;Sontum 2008).</p>
        <p>The pharmacokinetics and clinical assessment of Sonazoid showed a very good tolerance of the recommended clinical dose of 0.12 mL perfluorobutane microbubbles/kg weight in healthy adults (Li et al. 2017). Low MI (around 0.2 depending on the scanners) together with contrast-specific non-linear imaging methods should be used to avoid microbubble destruction. As for any agent, the dosage and scanner settings should be adjusted based on patient's body habitus, tissue attenuation, depth of lesions and specific requirements for repetitive injection.</p>
        <p>With clinical imaging of Sonazoid in liver, two phases of contrast enhancement are observed: a vascular phase, followed by a post-vascular phase or Kupffer phase. During Kupffer phase imaging, or parenchyma-specific imaging, the normal hepatic parenchyma is enhanced, and malignant lesions appear as clear contrast defects (Moriyasu and Itoh, 2009). The pattern of vascular phase and Kupffer phase enhancement can be used to better characterize focal liver lesions and to detect or rule out the presence of lesions (Correas et al. 2011;Jo et al. 2017;Zhai et al. 2019). Additionally, the prolonged time window during Kupffer phase imaging enables repeated scanning up to 10À60 min after injection, improving lesion detection. Kudo (2016) developed a defect reperfusion imaging method during which the contrast is re-injected based on enhancement defects detected during the stable Kupffer phase, providing additional information on arterial enhancement to improve the accurate diagnostic and treatment strategy of hepatocellular carcinoma. Figure 4 shows exemplary images after Sonozoid injection of liver metastasis and focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH). Off-label use of Sonazoid has been reported such as for the detection of sentinel lymph nodes (Shimazu et al. 2017).</p>
        <p>All commercial contrast agents meet the criteria as defined more than 3 decades ago for successful clinical utility after intravenous injections, particularly in terms of demonstrating an excellent safety profile (Main et al. 2007;Claudon et al. 2012). Variations in composition, physico-chemical and shell visco-elastic properties between the agents, as reported above, allows for specific applications depending on the agent. For example, the extremely non-linear behavior of SonoVue and Definity at low MI (lower than 0.1) is exploited (e.g., for real-time imaging in deep tissue where the ultrasound beam can be severely affected by attenuation). On the other hand, Sonazoid's high persistence and resistance to acoustic pressure allows its microbubbles to facilitate a specific Kupffer uptake (Fig. 5) not seen with the other marketed agents (Watanabe et al. 2007;Yanagisawa et al. 2007).</p>
        <p>While contrast-specific detection technology has seen dramatic progress since the introduction of UCA, successful clinical translation of new developments has been limited during the same period, while understanding of microbubble physical, chemical and biologic behavior has improved substantially. Indeed, technology has made enormous advancements with the introduction of, for example, targeted microbubbles for molecular imaging and for therapeutic applications, but none of these developments have resulted in new clinical agents specific to these applications. This section will focus on a new advancement that can be employed to optimize microbubble performance.</p>
        <p>The production methods of commercially available contrast agents result in microbubble suspensions with inherently polydisperse size distributions, typically ranging from 1À10 mm in diameter (Stride and Saffari, 2003). Microbubbles excited near their resonance frequency exhibit the strongest relative radial excursion and thereby produce the strongest non-linear echo response (Leighton, 1994;Segers et al. 2016a). Clinical ultrasound scanners operate at a narrow frequency bandwidth relative to the resonance frequencies of the microbubbles present in a typical polydisperse UCA. Consequently, only a small fraction of the microbubbles is excited near their resonance frequency and contributes to the generation of the non-linear echo. Indeed, it has frequently been suggested that the sensitivity of contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging can be improved by narrowing down the microbubble size distribution (Talu et al. 2007;Streeter et al. 2010). In fact, a sensitivity increase of 2À3 orders of magnitude has been measured in vitro for resonantly driven monodisperse microbubbles compared with a polydisperse agent (Segers et al. 2018b).</p>
        <p>The increased sensitivity provided by monodisperse microbubbles may particularly be of interest in ultrasound molecular imaging applications using ligand-bearing microbubbles, which can be targeted to specific receptors expressed on endothelial cells (Klibanov 2006). Successful binding of these molecular agents is non-trivial and depends on, for example, ligand-receptor affinity, ligand density, level of receptor expression, vessel diameter and wall shear rate (Tranquart et al. 2014). Although promising pre-clinical results have been reported demonstrating high ligand-receptor affinity and specificity (Pochon et al. 2010;Tardy et al. 2010), clinical translation has not yet resulted in approval of any ultrasound molecular imaging agent, despite positive initial clinical results (Smeenge et al. 2017;Willmann et al. 2017). It has been suggested that this is partially due to the polydisperse character of these agents, resulting in a suboptimal performance even at an agent dose corresponding to approximately 10 times the typical imaging dose used with a non-targeted agent such as SonoVue (Frinking et al. 2012).</p>
        <p>The suboptimal performance results from the fact that only small fractions of the total injected number of primarily offresonant microbubbles bind to the target site. Thus, an acoustically uniform and narrowband response of monodisperse microbubbles (Segers et al. 2016b) may dramatically improve imaging sensitivity of individually bound microbubbles. Moreover, monodisperse bubbles may allow for successful discrimination of targeted microbubbles from freely circulating ones through spectral changes owing to a resonance frequency shift of the microbubbles of a given size after binding (Overvelde et al. 2011).</p>
        <p>The narrowband and acoustically uniform response of a monodisperse microbubble suspension is furthermore of great interest for emerging theragnostic applications using microbubbles and ultrasound. The echogenic bubble can be tracked in the body while at increasing acoustic pressures it can locally deliver a drug payload (Tsutsui et al. 2004;Hernot and Klibanov 2008;Deelman et al. 2010;Carson et al. 2012;Dewitte et al. 2015), induce cell poration (Helfield et al. 2016), temporarily open the bloodÀbrain barrier (Hynynen et al. 2006;Choi et al. 2010;Konofagou et al. 2012) or lyse a blood clot (Molina et al. 2009). Key to all these emerging applications is a precise control over the interaction of microbubbles with the ultrasound wave (Stride and Edirisinghe 2009) to induce a maximal therapeutic effect while minimizing possible side effects such as haemorrhage and cell death (Karshafian et al. 2009;Wang et al. 2015;Snipstad et al. 2017). Such an accurate control over volumetric microbubble oscillations can be achieved by using monodisperse microbubbles. Furthermore, because of their uniform acoustic response, monodisperse microbubble populations may potentially solve remaining fundamental questions as to the optimal acoustic parameters and corresponding volumetric oscillation amplitudes required to induce therapeutic effects such as endocytosis, sonoporation and cell death (Karshafian et al. 2009;van Rooij et al. 2016: Roovers et al. 2019).</p>
        <p>For all these reasons, efforts have been made to develop next-generation microbubble agents with a narrow and controllable size distribution. To date, two strategies exist for achieving this. The first approach is based on isolating a subset of sizes from the native size distribution of a polydisperse microbubble suspension. This can be done by mechanical filtration (Emmer et al. 2009) (Fig. 6a), by decantation (Goertz et al. 2007) (Fig. 6b), by centrifugation (Feshitan et al. 2009) (Fig. 6c) or by pinched flow fractionation (Kok et al. 2015) (Fig. 6d). However, size uniformity obtained by these methods does not necessarily result in acoustic uniformity. However, polydisperse agents can also be sorted to their acoustic resonance in an acoustic bubble sorting chip (Segers and Versluis 2014) (Fig. 6e). It has been shown that an acoustically sorted bubble suspension has a uniform acoustic response (Segers et al. 2016a). A further limitation of the aforementioned sorting methods is that typical native size distributions of polydisperse agents primarily consist of small bubbles (smaller than 2À3 mm in diameter), whereas it has been suggested that larger bubbles (approximately 4À5 mm in diameter) are preferable for therapeutic applications such as bloodÀbrain barrier opening, since these bubbles are resonant to ultrasound frequencies typically used for therapy (lower than 1 MHz) (Choi et al. 2010).</p>
        <p>The second approach for producing monodisperse microbubbles is through direct bubble formation in a microfluidic flow-focusing device (Ganan-Calvo and Gordillo 2001; Anna et al. 2003;Garstecki et al. 2004;Garstecki et al. 2005;Dollet et al. 2008). In such a device, a gas thread is focused between two liquid flows through a constriction where it destabilizes because of capillary instability and pinches off to release monodisperse bubbles (Fig. 6f). The bubble size, stability and the generation frequency can now be accurately controlled through the gas pressure, the liquid flow rate and the lipid mixture (Segers et al. 2016b(Segers et al. , 2017(Segers et al. , 2019)). Bubble formation rates exceeding 1 million bubbles per second can be achieved using a single nozzle (Castro-Hernandez et al. 2011;Segers et al. 2016b), and 2.4 mL of a monodisperse microbubble suspension can be produced in 15 min using a microfluidic device as shown in Figure 6f. This would translate into producing a clinically relevant imaging dose in less than 1 min, considering the 2À3 orders of magnitude gain in sensitivity for monodisperse microbubbles compared with SonoVue (Segers et al. 2018b(Segers et al. , 2019)).</p>
        <p>The acoustic response of monodisperse microbubble suspensions was shown to have a narrowband and uniform response (Segers et al. 2016a(Segers et al. , 2016b(Segers et al. , 2018)). However, to date, questions remain as to the exact clinical requirements regarding monodispersity in terms of size and acoustic resonance behavior for imaging and especially for therapeutic applications. It is, for example, being debated that the improved sensitivity observed with monodisperse microbubbles may also be obtained with a polydisperse agent by injecting a higher dose (Talu et al. 2007;Kaya et al. 2010). Future studies are thus required to investigate the full clinical potential and in vivo performance of monodisperse microbubbles. Nevertheless, the current advances look promising, and these can drive forward emerging applications of lipid-coated microbubbles in combination with ultrasound that are currently suboptimal owing to the use of polydisperse agents.</p>
        <p>Contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging has seen tremendous progress during the last 3 decades. Historically, the clinical focus was primarily on echocardiography, for which LV opacification (i.e., improving LV endocardial border delineation) was the major indication, while myocardial perfusion was described as the holy grail and considered as a major market for contrast echo. The commercial agents have proven to be successful; however, there is still no approval for myocardial perfusion, and major clinical applications of contrast-enhanced ultrasound are outside cardiology with many relevant off-label opportunities still to be approved. Advancements in understanding microbubble physics, microbubble biophysics and the technological developments in ultrasound equipment with sensitive contrast-specific imaging methodologies have been of crucial importance for broad clinical acceptance of contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging, turning it into a mature and successful competitor of traditional diagnostic modalities, such as contrast-enhanced MRI and CT. It is expected that for successful development of future opportunities, such as ultrasound molecular imaging and therapeutic applications using microbubbles, new creative developments in microbubble engineering and production dedicated to further optimizing microbubble performance are required, and that they cannot rely on bubble technology developed more 3 three decades ago.</p>
