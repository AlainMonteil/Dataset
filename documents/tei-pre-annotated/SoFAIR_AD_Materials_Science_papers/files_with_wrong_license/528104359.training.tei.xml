        <p>A high surface area activated carbon was produced from the seed of Butia catarinensis (Bc), which was utilized for removing captopril from synthetic pharmaceutical industry wastewaters. The activated carbon was made by mixing ZnCl2 and Bc at a proportion of 1:1 and pyrolyzed at 600° (ABc-600). The material was characterized by the Boehm titration, hydrophilic/ hydrophobic ratio, elemental analysis, TGA, FTIR, and N2 isotherm (surface area (SBET), total pore volume (TPV), and pore size distribution (PSD)). The characterization data showed that the adsorbent displayed a hydrophilic surface due to the presence of several polar groups. The carbon material presented a TPV of 0.392 cm 3 g -1 , and SBET of 1267 m 2 g -1 . The equilibrium and kinetics data were suitably fitted to Liu isotherm and Avrami-fractional-order. The employment of the ABc-600 in the treatment of synthetic pharmaceutical industry wastewater exhibited high effectiveness in their removals (up to 99.0%).A high surface area activated carbon was produced from the seed of Butia catarinensis (Bc), which was utilized for removing captopril from synthetic pharmaceutical industry wastewaters.

        <p>Pharmaceuticals are used to improve the quality of life of humankind and domestic animals by curing diseases and prolonging longevity. However, the growing use of pharmaceutical products leads to releases of large amounts of drugs in pharmaceutical industry wastewaters (PIWW) [1], hospital effluents, and excretions of humans and livestock animals [2][3][4][5]. Ultimately, releases of drugs to waters are an environmental concern [2,3] because these compounds could affect living organisms and jeopardize the quality of the water resources [4].Pharmaceuticals are used to improve the quality of life of humankind and domestic animals by curing diseases and prolonging longevity.

        <p>Pharmaceuticals is one class of chemical compounds that are classified as emerging contaminants [3,6]. An emerging contaminant is a term used to describe synthetic or natural pollutants that have been detected in water bodies, which are not regularly monitored, which may cause ecological or human health impacts [3,6]. The pharmaceuticals in the environment come mainly from conventional wastewater treatment plants that are unable to remove these emerging concerns substances since they are not built to remove residual concentrations of these substances [5,7].Pharmaceuticals is one class of chemical compounds that are classified as emerging contaminants [3,6].

        <p>The treatment of waters and wastewaters containing pharmaceuticals is usually carried out using solar photo-Fenton [8,9], photolysis and photocatalysis [10][11][12], photo-Fenton electrochemical degradation [13], electrochemical oxidation [14], activated sludges [15,16], filtration [17,18], and adsorption [19][20][21][22][23][24]. However, these methodologies have shortcomings, such as high costs and high generation of sludges [25] and the formation of by-products [8,9]. This situation calls for further development of wastewater treatment methods and, in particular, adsorption presents some advantages for the treatment of effluents contaminated with pharmaceuticals, such as initial low cost for its implementation and easy operation.The treatment of waters and wastewaters containing pharmaceuticals is usually carried out using solar photo-Fenton [8,9], photolysis and photocatalysis [10][11][12], photo-Fenton electrochemical degradation [13], electrochemical oxidation [14], activated sludges [15,16], filtration [17,18], and adsorption [19][20][21][22][23][24].

        <p>Captopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE) used for the treatment of hypertension and some types of heart failure [26]. In Brazil, this medicine is given freeof-charge for any Brazillian-resident with hypertension problem by the Brazillian Popular Pharmacy Program [27]. Side effects of captopril have been reported as skin diseases (cutis laxa) [28], and some health problems in newborns and young infants [26,28].Captopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE) used for the treatment of hypertension and some types of heart failure [26].

        <p>The use of biochar and activated carbon for adsorption of pharmaceuticals is a hot topic in the adsorption literature [3,24]. Low-cost biomass is pyrolyzed in the absence of an oxygen atmosphere producing biochar. This carbon material can be utilized as is or activated in ways that improve the textural properties, thereby presenting sorption capacities similar to commercial activated carbons or other more expensive adsorbents [3]. The carbon materials (biochar, activated carbons) presents aromatic rings with several functional groups (carbonyl, carboxyl, phenol, esther), and other nitrogenated aromatic groups (pyrrole, imidazole, and pyridinic) [23,24,32]. These functional groups could interact with different organic compounds, such as pharmaceuticals products, by Hydrogen bonding, - stacking, pair donor-acceptor of an electron, and van der Waals interactions [23,24,33]. Besides, carbon adsorbent materials presenting high surface area, the high total volume of pores, and a suitable pore size distribution could contribute in a significant way for the removal of pharmaceuticals from aqueous effluents [23,24,30,32].The use of biochar and activated carbon for adsorption of pharmaceuticals is a hot topic in the adsorption literature [3,24].

        <p>In this paper, the Butia catarinensis residues were used for activated carbon preparation. The Butia catarinensis belongs to the Arecaceae family, and it is easily found in the southern region of South America, mainly in the Brazilian states of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina [34]. Its fruits and leaves play an important socioeconomic role in the region, where the leaves are utilized to fabricate hats, bags, and adornments [34]; the fruits are used for food production, and the seeds have no value and are usually discarded, motivating researches for employing such residue as a precursor for eco-friendly material production such activated carbon for water treatment.In this paper, the Butia catarinensis residues were used for activated carbon preparation.

        <p>Therefore, the seeds of the Butia catarinensis was utilized as a precursor for ZnCl2-activated carbon preparation. The carbon material was characterized by isotherms of adsorption and desorption of nitrogen, FTIR, XRD, CHN/O elemental analysis, Bohem titration, hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance (HI), and pHpzc. The kinetics, equilibrium, and thermodynamics of adsorption studies of captopril in the activated carbon were obtained, and the mechanisms of adsorption of captopril onto the carbon adsorbent were also proposed.

        <p>The thermal stability of the activated carbon was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The activated carbon was heated up from 20° to 1000°C, under a synthetic air atmosphere [39]. The thermogravimetric curve of ABc-600 activated carbon was obtained under a synthetic air atmosphere from room temperature up to 1000°C using a rate of 10°C min -1 (Fig 2). This analysis aims to see the thermal stability of the activated carbon under air, which is the atmosphere of work, and also obtain the contents of ashes at 1000°C [37]. Although the standard method for obtaining the ashes contents is carried out in a conventional porcelain crucible disposed in a muffle furnace at 600°C under air, the error of this analysis is high because the burn of the organic biomass is incomplete, and it could occur spattering of the sample in the muffle furnace. Therefore the use of an oxidizing atmosphere is to obtain the content of the ash in the activated carbon [39].The thermal stability of the activated carbon was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).

        <p>N2 isotherm for ABc-600 activated carbon could be classified by IUPAC [37] type I(b) (see Fig 1), which is characteristic of microporous adsorbent (pores size diameter ranging from 1.0 -3.5 nm). The PSD of ABc-600 presented the highest peak at 1.21 nm, then a second peak around 1.47 nm, a third broader peak 2.16-2.73 nm, and the fourth shoulder at 3.43 nm. After this last peak, the distribution of the pores decreases to approximately zero, which shows that ABc-600 activated carbon has, besides a portion of micropores, also a small portion of mesopores.N2 isotherm for ABc-600 activated carbon could be classified by IUPAC [37] type I(b) (see Fig 1), which is characteristic of microporous adsorbent (pores size diameter ranging from 1.0 -3.5 nm).

        <p>The N2 adsorbed volume by ABc-600 was 433.4 cm 3 g -1 , the SBET was 1267 m²g -1 and the TPV were 0.392 cm 3 g -1 . These values are in agreement with previous papers [23,30,32]. Lima et al. [23] prepared activated carbon from Brazil nutshell, using two proportions of biomass: ZnCl2 (1:1, and 1:1.5). The surface area of these materials were 1457 and 1640 m 2 g -1 , and TPV of 0.6661 and 0.9290 cm 3 g -1 for biomass: ZnCl2 of 1:1 and 1:1.5, respectively [23]. Kasperiski et al. [30] reported the preparation of activated carbons from Caesalpinia ferrea seed pod wastes. These authors prepared three activated carbons with different proportions of biomass: ZnCl2 (1:0.5, 1:1, and 1:1.5), and they obtained surface areas of 1050, 1469, and 1480 m 2 g -1 , and total pore volumes of 0.289, 0.401, and 0.572 cm 3 g -1 , for activated carbons prepared in the proportion biomass: ZnCl2 of 1:0.5, 1:1, and 1:1.5, respectively [30]. Leite et al. [32] prepared seven different activated carbons from avocado seed using a 2 2 -factorial design with three central points. The values of surface area ranged from 1122-1587 m 2 g - 1 , TPV ranging from 0.600 to 0.0847 cm 3 g -1 . The difference of these activated carbons cited above is related to the chemical composition of the carbon source (percentage of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) present in each biomass, amount of ZnCl2 utilized as an activating agent, temperature, and time of activation [32].The N2 adsorbed volume by ABc-600 was 433.4 cm 3 g -1 , the SBET was 1267 m²g -1 and the TPV were 0.392 cm 3 g -1 .

        <p>Four different weight loss temperature ranges were observed in the TGA and DTA curves for the ABc-600 activated carbon (Fig 2). The first weight loss (3.41% of the total weight) took place within the temperature range from 28.6° to 74.1°C, corresponding to the loss of adsorbed H2O. The second loss (1.56%) occurred in the interval of 74.1°-467.1°C, due to a water loss in the voids between AC particles and pores [23,39,42], thereby providing a measure for the thermal stability of the ABc-600 activated carbon.Four different weight loss temperature ranges were observed in the TGA and DTA curves for the ABc-600 activated carbon (Fig 2).

        <p>The third stage of weight loss was the most significant (92.40%). It was observed in a temperature range from 467.1° to 739.8°C. This stage is related to the carbon matrix decomposition in the activated carbon. The weight loss at the last stage, which took place in the presence of air at 739.8° to 1000°C, was only 0.36%. At this final temperature, the carbonaceous matrix was entirely oxidized [39], resting only the ashes contents of the ABc-600 activated carbon (2.17%). Therefore, the ashes content can be obtained by using a TGA analysis using an oxidizing atmosphere. The total weight loss of ABc-600 was 97.73% (Fig 2). Insert Fig 2 FTIR was used to identify the presence of the functional groups on ABc-600 activated carbon (Fig 3). The band at 3402 cm -1 is assigned to stretching of O-H groups with intermolecular H bonding [35,55], and peaks at 2922 (asymmetric) and 2852 cm -1 (symmetric) are related to the C-H stretching [20,23,55]. The bands at 1566 cm -1 are attributed to the asymmetric stretching of O=C of carboxylates [55] and the small bands at 1462 and 1400 cm -1 to ring modes of aromatics [20,23,30]. The vibrational band at 1385 cm -1 identifies N-C bonds of amines or amides, or H-C [23,35,36]. At 1253 cm -1 can be attributed to the C-O stretch of phenols or ethers [20,23,35]. The band at 1150 cm -1 is attributed to C-O of alcohols, and at 1120 cm -1 to the O-C-C stretch of an ester is identified [20,23,35]. The vibrational bands at 877 and 802 cm -1 might be assigned to out of plane C-H bends [20,23,35].The third stage of weight loss was the most significant (92.40%). It was observed in a temperature range from 467.1° to 739.8°C. This stage is related to the carbon matrix decomposition in the activated carbon. The weight loss at the last stage, which took place in the presence of air at 739.8° to 1000°C, was only 0.36%. At this final temperature, the carbonaceous matrix was entirely oxidized [39], resting only the ashes contents of the ABc-600 activated carbon (2.17%). Therefore, the ashes content can be obtained by using a TGA analysis using an oxidizing atmosphere. The total weight loss of ABc-600 was 97.73% (Fig 2). Insert Fig 2 FTIR was used to identify the presence of the functional groups on ABc-600 activated carbon (Fig 3). The band at 3402 cm -1 is assigned to stretching of O-H groups with intermolecular H bonding [35,55], and peaks at 2922 (asymmetric) and 2852 cm -1 (symmetric) are related to the C-H stretching [20,23,55].

        <p>One of the first parameters that should be optimized for performing batch adsorption experiments is the effect of the initial pH on adsorbate removal. In Fig S4 exhibits the pH effect on the captopril removal by the ABc-600 activated carbon. At pH 2.5, the removal of captopril was 90.3%. It was increased up to 94.6% at pH 5.5, and from this pH up to 10.0, the percentage of removal was almost constant. For the next experimental adsorption works, the pH of captopril solutions was adjusted to 7.0, considering a neutralized solution being a suitable medium for effluent treatment. 99.82% of captopril is presented as the species B. The specie B is negatively charged. Considering that at pH 7, both ABc-600 activated carbon and captopril are negatively charged, the mechanism of adsorption should not be an electrostatic attraction.

        <p>The adsorption experimental equilibrium data was successfully fitted by the Liu isotherm model, reaching a Qmax of 717.2 mg g -1 for captopril at 45°C. The removal of captopril onto ABc-600 followed a spontaneous and endothermic process, and the ruling mechanism was donor-acceptor interactions (n- interactions) between the aromatic rings of activated carbon with the carbonyl, O -of carboxylate, and N of the proline groups of captopril, the hydrogen bonding, and the pore-filling of the activated carbon.The adsorption experimental equilibrium data was successfully fitted by the Liu isotherm model, reaching a Qmax of 717.2 mg g -1 for captopril at 45°C.
