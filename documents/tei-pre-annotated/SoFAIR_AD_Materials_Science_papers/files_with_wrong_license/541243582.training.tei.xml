        <p>This paper considers a single-walled composite nano-shell (SWCNS) exposed in a torsional critical stability situation. As the magnetic field affects remarkably nanostructures in the small size, a three-dimensional magnetic field is assessed which contains magnetic effects along the circumferential, radial and axial coordinates system. Based on the results of the nonlocal model of strain gradient small-scale approach and the first-order shear deformation shell theory (FSDST), the problem is estimated. Afterward, the numerical results are taken analytically and compared with other existing literature. Hereafter, the influences of various factors, such as the magnetic field, are discussed deeply. It is observed that when the magnetic field is studied in three dimensions, the transverse magnetic effect is the most serious factor that affects fundamentally the torsional stability of the shell.This paper considers a single-walled composite nano-shell (SWCNS) exposed in a torsional critical stability situation.

        <p>Due to the urgent need of industries for high strength structures with low weight, nano-composite shells are a good choice for this field. Over the years, nano-composite materials have been found from laboratory to commercial and industrial applications and have also many applications in various industries such as aerospace, defense, offshore and automotive. Some nano-composite structures which have been made, e.g. magnetic nano-composite structures, have received further attention over the previous years. These materials present impressive properties that outweigh the properties of conventional composite materials. The magnetic nano-composite structures are useful for producers of actuators and small motors, especially computer hardware, audio and video ( Elimelech, Gregory, Jia &amp; Williams, 1995 ).Due to the urgent need of industries for high strength structures with low weight, nano-composite shells are a good choice for this field.

        <p>To design different structures, analyzes such as static, dynamic, vibrational, fracture and buckling ones are performed. Since cylindrical nano-shell/tube structures are more susceptible to buckling loads, stability analysis is one of the most serious analyses of these types of structures. Among the nano-shell structures, the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are the most customary nano-shells that have been greatly investigated. Han and Lu (2003) based on the local continuum mechanics, studied the torsional stability of a double-walled carbon nanotube (DWCNT) based on considering an elastic substrate. They employed the classical shell model and solved the gained equations by means of the Navier solution technique. Wang, Yang and Dong (2005) considered multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) under a torsional stability condition based on the local classical continuum shell model. Lu and Wang (2006) combined torsional and axial stability conditions in order to estimate the local continuum shell MWCNTs. Zhang and Shen (2006) examined a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) with the help of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation subjected to torsion, axial and external pressures by assuming a thermal surrounding. In some valuable research works, other researchers have also studied CNTs in the case of torsional stability ( Jeong, Lim &amp; Sinnott, 2007 ;Wang, Quek &amp; Varadan, 2007 ;Yang &amp; Wang, 2007 ;Zhang &amp; Wang, 2008 ). Later, Shen and Zhang (2010) modeled a DWCNT by using first-order shear deformation shell theory (FS-DST) and in conjunction with nonlocal elasticity and also considering the thermal environment. Hao, Guo and Wang (2010) , Natsuki, Tsuchiya, Ni and Endo (2010) , on the other hand, worked on the shell model of DWCNTs based on the nonlocal elasticity theory. Khademolhosseini, Rajapakse and Nojeh (2010) used a modified Timoshenko shell model to evaluate a SWCNT in a shell domain based on the nonlocal theory of Eringen. In various conditions and cases, some other studies have been done on the CNTs exposed to torsional stability ( Chowdhurry, Wang &amp; Koh, 2014 ;Parvaneh, Shariati, Torabi, Masood &amp; Sabeti, 2012 ;Song &amp; Zha, 2011 ;Zhang &amp; Li, 2015 ). More newly, Xiaohu, Yugang and Hanzhou (2013) carried out an electric and thermal field around the CNTs exposed to torsion by examining size effects. Ghorbanpour Arani, Abdollahian, Kolahchi and Rahmati (2013) analyzed a DWCNT subjected to the torsional critical force and thermal effects with considering piezoelectricity impact. They applied the FSDST and also assumed a matrix outer the system. The piezoelectric field was assumed in one direction. They solved the harvested stability relations regarding the Navier approach. In an effective paper, Mehralian, Tadi Beni and Karimi Zeverdejani (2017) simulated natural frequencies of a shell FSDST-CNTs by using MD based on different small-scale theories, namely modified couple stress theory (CST), nonlocal elasticity theory (NT), strain gradient theory (ST) and nonlocal strain gradient theory (NSGT). Their numerical outcomes approved more conformity of the results of nonlocal strain gradient theory with MD. More recently, however, Shojaeefard, Mahinzare, Safarpour, Saeidi Googarchin and Ghadiri (2018) presented the natural frequencies of a Timoshenko nano-composite shell by taking electric-magnetic and thermal environments into account. They assumed that the shell was under an ultra-fast rotation and was inserted in an elastic substrate. To capture the small-scale effects, the modified couple stress theory was discussed. Finally, they calculated the natural frequencies of the shell in the mentioned conditions based on the Navier analytical method and also generalized differential quadrature (GDQ) numerical method. Sahmani and Aghdam (2018) established the nonlocal strain gradient approach to study axial stability and post-stability responses of a nano-shell incorporating electric and magnetic field effects. They used the classical shell model in employing the cartesian coordinate system.

        <p>Until the date, no paper has been recorded on an analysis of the torsional stability of nano-composite shells regarding a three-dimensional magnetic field based on the NSGT. Therefore, this paper studies a nano-composite material, i.e. BaTiO 3 -CoFe 2 O 3 in a shell-like structure. As this material is a smart piezomagnetic structure, it could be utilized in several nanoelectro/magneto-mechanical systems. Hence, torsional stability analysis of such the nanostructure can be significant resulting in many advantages. This motivated authors to assess the torsional stability of the nano-composite shell while the magnetic field has three-dimensional influences. To predict the motion of the model's nodes, the first-order shear deformation shell hypothesis is employed. To address the size effects, the nonlocal theory of strain gradient is practiced. To attain the graphs based on the numerical outcomes, an analytical solution technique is exploited. In the results section, different key factors, such as the magnetic field and small-scale act, are taken into the investigation.Until the date, no paper has been recorded on an analysis of the torsional stability of nano-composite shells regarding a three-dimensional magnetic field based on the NSGT.

Although the numerical results originated from NSGT completely depend on the correct values of the parameters e 0 a and l , these factors should be obligatory obtained in an experiment.As far as no literature has been reported till now on the torsional buckling of a nano-composite shell inserted in a three-dimensional magnetic field, therefore, the formulation would be reduced into a nano-shell/tube under torsion with removing magnetic effects.

        <p>To proceed with the parametric solution for the nano-composite shell, the properties mentioned in Table 2 are employed. To make the numerical outcomes, first, the effect of stress nonlocality versus magnetic field by variations in axial halfwave numbers is depicted. To do this, Figure 2 a is for n = 1 and Figure 2 b is drawn for n = 5. As it is shown, the increase of axial half-wave numbers tends to increase the torsional capacity. In addition to this, an increase in the magnetic field enlarges the torsional capacity. It is also worthy to note that an increase in axial half-wave numbers remarkably increases the effect of stress nonlocality. This is due to the increase in the distance of curves of the results of various nonlocal parameters. It is also observed that the increase of axial half-wave numbers makes the torsional stability noticeably larger in a local condition than while the stress nonlocality is considered. This is due to the softening effect of the nonlocality. That's why the slope of the results of e 0 a = 0 in both cases is much steeper. Besides these, it can be conducted that for higher axial half-wave numbers, the impact of magnetic potential in a nonlocal domain is more than a local one. This is because of more gaps between the results of cases e 0 a = 0.5 nm, ψ= 0, with e 0 a = 0.5 nm, ψ= 0.5 A, and also another one. Based on the Kok &amp; Wong, 2016 ). * * FSDT shell theory in conjunction with NSGT (0 &lt; e 0 a ≤ 1.5 nm, 0 &lt; l ≤ 8 nm).To proceed with the parametric solution for the nano-composite shell, the properties mentioned in Table 2 are employed.

Besides these, it can be conducted that for higher axial half-wave numbers, the impact of magnetic potential in a nonlocal domain is more than a local one. This is because of more gaps between the results of cases e 0 a = 0.5 nm, ψ= 0, with e 0 a = 0.5 nm, ψ= 0.5 A, and also another one.

        <p>To consider the influence of stress nonlocality and magnetic field more deeply, Figure 3 a,b as similar as the previous ones are indicated, however by changes in circumferential half-wave numbers. Regarding both presented figures, it can be witnessed that the increase of the circumferential half-wave numbers makes the torsional stability fundamentally further than axial ones. It is noteworthy that the increase of circumferential half-wave numbers even if the axial wave number is chosen as greater than one, leads to a steadily increasing trend for buckling loads. The important point of these two figures, however, can be the fact that for larger circumferential half-wave numbers, there has never been seen any major impact on variations of the magnetic potential.To consider the influence of stress nonlocality and magnetic field more deeply, Figure 3 a,b as similar as the previous ones are indicated, however by changes in circumferential half-wave numbers.

        <p>To clarify the influences of the strain gradient scale parameter, Fig. 4 a and b are revealed, respectively. Based on these figures it can be remarked that the increase of the strain gradient parameter leads to decreasing the effect of the magnetic field.

        <p>In fact, the distance is lower for the second case leads to this conclusion that the increase of torsional buckling loads which resulted from the increase of the magnetic potential is lower in the larger values of the strain gradient parameter. It can be somehow stated that if the material is stiffer, the increase of magnetic potential does not affect outstandingly the stability. On the other hand, as is clear, the increase of the axial half-wave numbers when the strain gradient parameter is chosen as larger, results in a greater impact of the waves on the torsional stability. This means the larger the values of the strain gradient factor, the greater the impact of the axial half-wave numbers.In fact, the distance is lower for the second case leads to this conclusion that the increase of torsional buckling loads which resulted from the increase of the magnetic potential is lower in the larger values of the strain gradient parameter.

        <p>To study the effect of an increase of magnetic potential on the torsional stability response of the nano-composite shell, the Fig. 5 the magnetic potential increases further the torsional stability by an increase of the axial half-wave numbers. This result is also achieved for the second figure. Additionally, by comparing Figs. 2 b and 5 b, it is interesting to say that whenever the circumferential half-wave number is selected bigger, the negative slope of curves of results which is related to the lower axial wave numbers, is steeper. On the other side, Fig. 5 c illustrates that even powerful and high magnetic environments cannot affect the torsional stability of the nano-composite shell while the circumferential half-wave number is large. Either way, about the effect of the magnetic surrounding on the circumferential wave numbers, it can be said that the strong magnetic field affects the shell's stability if and only if the circumferential half-wave number is small.To study the effect of an increase of magnetic potential on the torsional stability response of the nano-composite shell, the Fig. 5 the magnetic potential increases further the torsional stability by an increase of the axial half-wave numbers.

        <p>In order to consider the effect of a three-dimensional magnetic field versus other magnetic fields, initially, the axial halfwave number is investigated while the magnetic potential is for two cases, weak and powerful magnetic fields which are shown by Fig. 6 a and b respectively. From the first figure, as it is vividly seen, when the magnetic field three-dimensionally affected the model, the torsional stability capacity of the shell is lower. But, on the other hand, when the effect is twodimensional as well as while the transverse effect ( B z = 0) is neglected, the highest stability for the nano-shell is predicted. This means that the transverse magnetic effect makes weaker the composite shell under torsional conditions. By comparing the results of three cases of one-dimensional magnetic effect, one can find that on the torsional stability of nano-shells, the transverse magnetic effect ( B z = 0), circumferential magnetic effect ( B θ = 0) and axial magnetic effect ( B x = 0) respectively are making the model weaker under torsion. This can prove that the effect of transverse magnetic is more significant than the others. It is also worth mentioning that when we have a three-dimensional magnetic effect; the stability is further than when there is a two-axis effect by assuming B x = 0. It is also interesting to note that by the increase of the axial half-wave numbers the importance of analysis of magnetic effect in various directions can be demonstrated. In fact, this can be in light of the increase in the distances between the results of various cases in the diagram by the increase of the wave numbers. Moreover, after looking into the second plotted figure, it can be clearly seen that the second diagram also approves the The axial half-wave number vs. three-axis magnetic influences ( e 0 a = 0. 5 nm , l * = 0.5, n = 1, ψ= 0.1A ).

Fig. 7 a and b respectively exhibit the influence of an increase of the circumferential half-wave number under different cases of the magnetic field, first, in a weak magnetic condition and second for a high magnetic condition. First off, in comparison of these two figures with the Fig. 6 a and b, one can find that the increase of the circumferential half-wave numbers increases dramatically the importance of the different magnetic fields. In other words, whatever the circumferential wave numbers increased, the results in the figures have become far from each other by a very steep slope.
