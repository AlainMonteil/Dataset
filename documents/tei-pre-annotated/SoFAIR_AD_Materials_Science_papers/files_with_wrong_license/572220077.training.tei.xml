        <p>Apart from its clinical use in imaging, ultrasound has been thoroughly investigated as a tool to enhance drug delivery in a wide variety of applications. Therapeutic ultrasound, as such or combined with cavitating nuclei or microbubbles, has been explored to cross or permeabilize different biological barriers. This ability to access otherwise impermeable tissues in the body makes the combination of ultrasound and therapeutics very appealing to enhance drug delivery in situ. This review gives an overview of the most important biological barriers that can be tackled using ultrasound and aims to provide insight on how ultrasound has shown to improve accessibility as well as the biggest hurdles. In addition, we discuss the clinical applicability of therapeutic ultrasound with respect to the main challenges that must be addressed to enable the further progression of therapeutic ultrasound towards an effective, safe and easy-to-use treatment tailored for drug delivery in patients.Apart from its clinical use in imaging, ultrasound has been thoroughly investigated as a tool to enhance drug delivery in a wide variety of applications.

        <p>Ultrasound is a sound wave with frequencies ranging between 20 kHz and 20 MHz and therefore not perceivable by the human ear. Animals such as bats and dolphins use ultrasound for echolocation in the dark or for underwater orientation [1][2][3]. In the footsteps of animals, humans have further built on these principles to develop sonars for fish detection or to control the depth of the fairway [1,3]. Also in the clinic, ultrasound is frequently applied as an imaging modality [4], especially in the prenatal screening of the foetus which is by far the best known application of ultrasound these days. Diagnostic ultrasound can make use of ultrasound contrast agents (UCA) consisting of microbubbles [5,6]. These are polydisperse gas-filled vesicles with a size of 1-10 mm that are mostly stabilized by a lipid or protein shell [6,7]. Although they can be very diverse in shell and gas core composition, all microbubbles are effective candidates for contrast enhancement as they are resonators driven by the compressibility of their gaseous core [6,[8][9][10][11][12][13][14]. As microbubbles are too large to extravasate, they constitute ideal contrast agents for cardiovascular imaging of well perfused organs such as heart, liver and kidney [15]. The use of contrast agents for imaging applications has been highlighted in other reviews [5,16,17]. Apart from their use as contrast agents, microbubbles are increasingly recognized as theranostic agents in the drug delivery field as they can stimulate drug uptake in cells and tissues (Fig. 1) due to ultrasound induced cavitation, which is the expansion and compression of the microbubbles' gaseous core in response to the ultrasound field [6,12]. Depending on the type of ultrasound and whether it is combined with ultrasound contrast agents, different biological effects can take place. Biological effects induced by ultrasound can be generally divided into three main groups; mechanical effects, thermal effects and chemical effects [12]. This review focuses mainly on the mechanical effects of microbubble cavitation and their aid in crossing biological barriers. Nonetheless, it is important to mention that ultrasound can also provoke biological effects via ultrasound induced heating effects, frequently used for thermal ablation, or by chemical effects notwithstanding these effects are not discussed in detail in this review [6,16,18,19].Ultrasound is a sound wave with frequencies ranging between 20 kHz and 20 MHz and therefore not perceivable by the human ear.

        <p>The scope of this review is to give an overview of the most important biological barriers that have been tackled with ultrasound and report on the main findings in these specific fields. We have divided this review in two parts. First we briefly explain microbubble cavitation (Section 2) and give an overview of different in vitro cellular studies that have investigated how the cell membrane barrier can be specifically overcome by microbubbles and ultrasound and the cellular responses it can evoke as a result (Section 3). In the second part of this review we discuss how therapeutic ultrasound has been used to cross specific biological barriers in vivo (Section 4).The scope of this review is to give an overview of the most important biological barriers that have been tackled with ultrasound and report on the main findings in these specific fields.

        <p>The potential of microbubbles as drug delivery enhancers is based on the fact that their exposure to ultrasound induces volumetric oscillations (Fig. 1) of the microbubble, which in turn induces biological effects [16]. Ultrasound is a pressure waves (Fig. 1) propagating through a medium. This pressure wave is characterized by alternating high and low pressures that are respectively inducing microbubble compression and expansion [7,16]. The amplitude of the sound wave indicates the acoustic pressure used. Note that often, when nonlinear propagation occurs, the ultrasound wave becomes asymmetric and the positive pressure exceeds the negative pressure magnitude. Safety indices (MI) are therefore typically calculated using the peak negative pressure (PNP) which better reflects the risk of cavitation.The potential of microbubbles as drug delivery enhancers is based on the fact that their exposure to ultrasound induces volumetric oscillations (Fig. 1) of the microbubble, which in turn induces biological effects [16].

        <p>At lower acoustic pressures, in free field, microbubble cavitation is qualified as stable: the expansion and compression phase of the microbubbles are symmetric and the bubble behaves mostly linearly (low harmonic level or broadband acoustic emissions). Note that in this review, we disregard the nonlinear effect caused by the bubble shell as these are mostly important below 50 kPa. A symmetry-breaking in the environment of the bubble, such as a polymeric membrane or the presence of tissue on one side can induce non-spherical oscillations, giving rise to microstreaming around the microbubble and shear stress on cellular membranes. Higher acoustic pressures lead to so-called inertial cavitation. It is characterized by violent microbubble oscillations. In particular, surrounding fluid inertia dominates the gas pressure of the core during collapse [7,20,21], leading to highly nonlinear behaviour, and to the apparition of broadband acoustic emission from the microbubbles. The more chaotic and violent microbubble oscillations become, they can induce shock waves, microbubble jetting, shear and tangential stresses, which can result in cell membrane poration or even cell death [4,12,[22][23][24]. The bubble stability is strongly affected by these high pressures, and it often fragments and moves. Biological effects are thus in a great deal caused by the microbubble cavitation behaviour [21]. As microbubble behaviour is, in turn, largely dictated by the specific settings of the ultrasound field, we have summarized in Fig. 1 the most important ultrasound wave properties that can be tuned to enable the desired biological effect. The ultrasound wave is characterized by a number of physical parameters that are the frequency, the acoustic pressure, the number of cycles, the pulse duration and the pulse repetition frequency (providing the duty cycle) that are all important to predict microbubble behaviour and hence the biological effects [6,7,9,12,25,26]. A major hurdle in ultrasound mediated drug delivery is to compare the outcome of different studies as these use a wide variety of microbubble types and acoustic settings. Overall, there is no real convention on how ultrasound parameters should be reported and they are, in many drug delivery reports, restricted to the frequency, pressure (or the two latter combined in the mechanical index (MI)). For a more in depth understanding of the impact of acoustic conditions on the biophysical effects of microbubbles, the reader is referred to other, more specialized reviews which have been published recently [6,7,12,27].At lower acoustic pressures, in free field, microbubble cavitation is qualified as stable: the expansion and compression phase of the microbubbles are symmetric and the bubble behaves mostly linearly (low harmonic level or broadband acoustic emissions).

        <p>The direct impact of microbubble cavitation on cellular barriers has been investigated in vitro on various cell lines including cancer cell lines and primary endothelial cells [8,[28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37]. The latter is the most biologically relevant as microbubbles cannot extravasate from the blood stream after intravenous injection. The endothelial layer is thus the biological barrier they have an immediate impact on.The direct impact of microbubble cavitation on cellular barriers has been investigated in vitro on various cell lines including cancer cell lines and primary endothelial cells [8,[28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37].

        <p>The cell membrane is a complex double phospholipid layer that contains protein complexes that mediate cell signalling [38]. It has a crucial function in maintaining cellular homeostasis as it surrounds cell organelles while maintaining an ion gradient between the intraand extracellular space. Several studies have applied microbubbles and ultrasound to promote the intracellular delivery of drugs as cavitating microbubbles are known to affect membrane integrity depending on the ultrasound pressure (Fig. 2). When moderate ultrasound pressures ( 100 kPa) are applied, it has been reported that stably cavitating microbubbles can stimulate endocytosis (Fig. 2 left) while oscillating in close proximity of the cell membrane [6][7][8]12,39,40]. At higher pressures (&gt;100 kPa) the bubble dynamics become violent enough to create pores in cell membranes, which is called sonoporation (Fig. 2 right) [6][7][8]12,39]. Once the pores are formed, they allow a direct passage of the co-delivered drug towards the cellular cytoplasm. There have been reports that low ultrasound pressures, inducing stable microbubble cavitation, can lead to pore formations provided that the microbubble is directly touching the cell, through a continuously pushing and pulling of the cell membrane creating a cyclic tangential stress on the membrane (colloquially referred to as 'massaging' the cell membrane) [9,41,42]. However, most studies suggest that stable cavitation might not be sufficient and mainly inertial cavitation leads to pore formation [4,8,9,12,[22][23][24][42][43][44][45]. The majority of sonoporation experiments have focused on the uptake of small reporter molecules drugs like propidium iodide (Fig. 3) or Sytox TM dyes to study sonoporation [8,20,29,[46][47][48]. However, cellular delivery of (slightly) larger macromolecules like FITC-dextrans, nucleic acids (i.e. pDNA, mRNA and siRNA) and nano-sized liposomes via sonoporation has been investigated, albeit more recently [8,22,35,41,[49][50][51]. The use of larger reporter molecules like dextrans can be interesting to determine the cut-off of the formed pores by different ultrasound parameters [20].The cell membrane is a complex double phospholipid layer that contains protein complexes that mediate cell signalling [38].

        <p>From studying the delivery of nanomedicines by means of nanoparticle-loaded microbubbles, a new phenomenon has been identified. Loading microbubbles with nanoparticles is attractive to simultaneously stimulate drug release and cellular permeabilization during microbubble cavitation as this could minimize off-target effects [35,37,45,52,53]. De Cock, et al. found that exposure of nanoparticle loaded microbubbles to long and intense ultrasound pulses can actively deposit nanoparticles in patches on the cell membrane, which they termed sonoprinting [37,[54][55][56]. Fluorescence high speed imaging experiments revealed that sonoprinting arises when microbubbles shell fragments and attached nanoparticles are dragged towards the cell layer by the microbubble gas core as it is pushed by acoustic radiation forces [37,54,55]. The precise mechanisms, however, require further investigation. Pellow, et al. detected the disposition of microbubble shell fragments onto endothelial cells in the vessel wall in vivo and attributed it to sonoprinting [57]. These first results might indicate that it is possible to deposit microbubble shell fragments onto cell layers in vivo. Whether it could equally deposit shell-attached nanomedicines in vivo has still to be further investigated.From studying the delivery of nanomedicines by means of nanoparticle-loaded microbubbles, a new phenomenon has been identified.

        <p>Today, the exact biophysical mechanisms behind sonoporation are still not yet completely elucidated, although high-speed imag-ing (100,000 to 25 million frames per second (fps)) has been essential over the years in correlating bubble physics and biological effects to unravel the drug delivery potential [6,12,32,54,55,58]. The use of distinct imaging speeds is required to resolve the biophysical and biological aspects of sonoporation [20]. Slower biological effects are best investigated using fluorescent confocal imaging at a few frames per second while the exact bubble interaction with (cellular) surroundings on the timescale of the ultrasound burst can only be visualized with high speed fluorescence imaging (100,000-200,000 fps) and the exact bubble cavitation behaviour requires ultra-high speed bright-field imaging (up to 25 million fps) [7,54,55,59,60]. Three imaging speeds are necessary to unravel microbubble-induced biological effects. It is very complex in practice to combine the equipment to perform the three imaging techniques, operating at framerates separated by several orders of magnitude, simultaneously. Therefore, correlating microbubble oscillations, biophysical aspects and subsequent biological effects remains a challenge. Recent developments made to couple the Brandaris ultra-high speed camera with a confocal fluorescence microscope have already shown to improve our understanding of microbubble cavitation behaviour and of the corresponding biological outcome [58,60]. In these studies it has been shown that the relative oscillation amplitude of the microbubbles, e.g. the relative expansion and reduction of the microbubble radius upon ultrasound exposure, is an important parameter to predict sonoporation [29,59]. More specifically, sonoporation is correlated with high oscillation amplitudes of microbubbles [59]. A single resonance frequency exists for each microbubble size. Since this frequency will result in maximum microbubble oscillation amplitude, it is important to carefully select the ultrasound frequency with regards to the microbubbles population used to maximize cavitation effects [7]. In this context, it is important to realize that relatively low ultrasound pressures can already induce high amplitude oscillations and thus mechanical effects when the ultrasound frequency is perfectly aligned with the microbubble size, while higher pressures can be required to induce sonoporation when bubble size and ultrasound frequency are not perfectly matched. The latter could at least partially explain the wide variety of acoustic pressures that have been reported in sonoporation studies. This particular problem becomes even more complex when using polydisperse agents [61][62][63], the majority of the bubbles will always be driven off-resonance which hinders control over the cavitation dynamics. Nonetheless, the relative microbubble oscillation amplitude can be a useful way to compare different sonoporation experiments independently of the acoustic pressure [7], which was extensively done for single bubble experiments. It is however important to realize that, next to microbubble cavitation, secondary effects such as microbubble translation induced by radiation forces and microbubble clustering can impact the drug delivery process. These secondary effects become particularly significant when higher microbubble concentrations and/or longer acoustic pulses are applied. For further detailed understanding we refer to earlier reviews where these biophysical aspects have been discussed in more depth [6,7,12,20,27].Today, the exact biophysical mechanisms behind sonoporation are still not yet completely elucidated, although high-speed imag-ing (100,000 to 25 million frames per second (fps)) has been essential over the years in correlating bubble physics and biological effects to unravel the drug delivery potential [6,12,32,54,55,58].

        <p>Although pore induction is highly relevant to allow drug uptake, it can also impact cell homeostasis and even lead to cell death. Generally, the toxicity that is associated with sonoporation will largely depend on the ability of the cell to reseal its pore. In other words pores can either be transient or lethal [31]. Hu, et al. studied the pore resealing process after sonoporation and defined that resealing is strongly dependent on the pore size. Indeed, when smaller pores are created, pores will successfully reseal and the sonoporation process is reversible. If pores are too large with respect to the cell size, it becomes unlikely that the cell will be able to reseal again and irreversible sonoporation is likely to occur, followed by cell death [6,42]. Generally, pore resealing should occur within 2 min to allow recovery. Resealing times that exceed Fig. 2. Schematic overview the direct cellular impact of ultrasound. Ultrasound can directly influence endocytosis (1) or induce cell membrane pores (2). The latter results in Ca 2+ influx which induces various intracellular responses like pore resealing (through endo-or exocytosis) as well as cytoskeleton reorganization and perturbation. These cellular responses will finally determine if sonoporation can either lead to a transient perturbation of the cell membrane or to sonoporation induced cell death. Intracellular responses can even extend to neighbouring cells via calcium waves which is the transport of intracellular signalling molecules through gap junctions, specific ion channels that connect neighbouring cells. 120 s will result in cell death [31,32,42,64,65]. Fan, et al. defined a model to correlate the pore size and pore resealing time based on PI influx into the cell that has been further explored by other groups [32,66]. It has become clear that pore resealing and hence cell survival is largely governed by the intracellular influx of Ca 2+ ions (Fig. 2) [9]. This hypothesis was supported by the findings of both Hu, et al. and Deng, et al. showing that extracellular calcium ions are indispensable for pore resealing [42,67].Although pore induction is highly relevant to allow drug uptake, it can also impact cell homeostasis and even lead to cell death.

        <p>In fact, there are at least three important cellular responses that are known to be governed by calcium influx [9]. First, when small pores (nm-range) are formed, only a small increase of intracellular Ca 2+ -levels will occur and as such trigger cell membrane endocytosis to quickly seal the pore (Fig. 2) [8,9,39,[68][69][70]. However, when larger pores are formed, the larger increase in calcium influx can result in exocytosis instead (Fig. 2) where intracellular phospholipid vesicles can reseal the pore through patch formation [9,42,68,71]. After pore resealing, microscopy reveals the appearance of a thickened rim at the previous location of the pore [42]. When pores are too large, intracellular Ca 2+ concentration can exceed the cell death threshold [9,72]. It is known that cancer cells are continuously promoting the reduction of the homeostatic intracellular Ca 2+ concentration [73,74]. This decrease in the intracellular Ca 2+ content makes cancer cells much more resistant to cell death as the Ca 2+ -dependent cell death threshold is less easily met. The exact degree to which this threshold is exceeded also defines whether the cell death will be apoptotic or necrotic [72,[75][76][77], which can induce different immune responses. Apoptosis is considered a controlled and contained form of cell death, where the cell membrane remains intact [78][79][80]. The dying cell will form numerous small vesicles retaining the cell cytoplasm and organelles, called apoptotic bodies, that are released into the intercellular space where they can be taken up by surrounding cells [79]. Necrosis, on the other hand is considered as the unregulated and uncontrolled form of cell digestion where the loss of membrane integrity is a hallmark. Necrosomes facilitate the uncontrolled release of cellular components into the intercellular space. This release can activate the immune system and elicit inflammation and is therefore known to be immunogenic [78,79]. These latter findings will be more extensively explained in the immunological barrier (Section 4.5). In some cases, the induction of cell death is highly desirable, e.g. in cancer (immuno)therapy where cell destruction does not compromise safety. However, for other drug delivery applications like gene therapy, maintaining a high cell viability after sonoporation remains crucial [31].In fact, there are at least three important cellular responses that are known to be governed by calcium influx [9]. First, when small pores (nm-range) are formed, only a small increase of intracellular Ca 2+ -levels will occur and as such trigger cell membrane endocytosis to quickly seal the pore (Fig. 2) [8,9,39,[68][69][70]. However, when larger pores are formed, the larger increase in calcium influx can result in exocytosis instead (Fig. 2) where intracellular phospholipid vesicles can reseal the pore through patch formation [9,42,68,71]. After pore resealing, microscopy reveals the appearance of a thickened rim at the previous location of the pore [42]. When pores are too large, intracellular Ca 2+ concentration can exceed the cell death threshold [9,72]. It is known that cancer cells are continuously promoting the reduction of the homeostatic intracellular Ca 2+ concentration [73,74]. This decrease in the intracellular Ca 2+ content makes cancer cells much more resistant to cell death as the Ca 2+ -dependent cell death threshold is less easily met. The exact degree to which this threshold is exceeded also defines whether the cell death will be apoptotic or necrotic [72,[75][76][77], which can induce different immune responses. Apoptosis is considered a controlled and contained form of cell death, where the cell membrane remains intact [78][79][80]. The dying cell will form numerous small vesicles retaining the cell cytoplasm and organelles, called apoptotic bodies, that are released into the intercellular space where they can be taken up by surrounding cells [79]. Necrosis, on the other hand is considered as the unregulated and uncontrolled form of cell digestion where the loss of membrane integrity is a hallmark. Necrosomes facilitate the uncontrolled release of cellular components into the intercellular space. This release can activate the immune system and elicit inflammation and is therefore known to be immunogenic [78,79]. These latter findings will be more extensively explained in the immunological barrier (Section 4.5). In some cases, the induction of cell death is highly desirable, e.g. in cancer (immuno)therapy where cell destruction does not compromise safety. However, for other drug delivery applications like gene therapy, maintaining a high cell viability after sonoporation remains crucial [31].</p>
        <p>More recent studies have shown that the intracellular calcium influx in a sonoporated cell can also have an impact on adjacent cells [7,9,30,81,82]. A further understanding of this phenomenon could be particularly interesting for specific cellular barriers like the blood-brain endothelial barrier that will be discussed later on in this review. Sonoporation-induced intracellular Ca 2+ -influx was shown to result in calcium waves that are transferred via gap junctions to surrounding cells [82,83]. In short, Ca 2+ -influx Each new episode of filamentary actin loss, deduced with respect to the previous time point shown, is marked by a yellow cross. These episodes took place on an acute basis immediately after sonoporation (see frames at 10, 20 and 30 s) and on a time-delayed basis (see frames at 40 and 60 min).

        <p>leads to binding of the Ca 2+ -ions to the IP 3 messenger present in cytosol [84]. The activated IP 3 can subsequently induce calcium release, called calcium-induced calcium release (CICR), via two pathways (Fig. 2); First, it can bind onto the IP 3 -receptor (IP 3 R) on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and activate the (sarco-) endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ -ATPase pump (SERCA), resulting in an even higher calcium concentration intracellularly [83][84][85][86][87][88]. The other option is that the IP 3 -messenger diffuses to the adjacent cells through gap junctions, ion channels connecting neighbouring cells (Fig. 2), leading to calcium release in the adjacent cells, the socalled calcium waves [83]. As elevated calcium levels are known to induce many cellular processes, calcium waves are likely to provoke biological effects in neighbouring cells that are not directly caused by sonoporation [89,90]. This implies that endocytosis is not solely stimulated by a direct microbubble contact but might also be the indirect result of an adjacent sonoporated cell [7,9]. This could have also been the case in the study of De Cock, et al. They used flow cytometry to demonstrate that both, sonoporation as well as endocytosis of small and high molecular weight dextrans were stimulated when cells were exposed to cavitating microbubbles [8]. More experiments investigating the indirect biological effects of sonoporation onto neighbouring cells are therefore necessary to further clarify the interplay between endocytosis and sonoporation.leads to binding of the Ca 2+ -ions to the IP 3 messenger present in cytosol [84].

        <p>Furthermore, intracellular Ca 2+ -levels can also be increased through the opening of mechanosensitive ion-channels. Mechanosensing or the perception of mechanical forces by cells is a defence mechanism to safeguard the cell from danger [91]. The cells subsequently translate the perceived mechanical stimuli to evoke a response proportional to the experienced forces, called mechanotransduction [8,92]. As the cytoskeleton is physically linked to the cell membrane [93], it plays a major role in mechanotransduction by mediating the opening of mechanosensitive ion channels [94]. This controls the influx and efflux of various ions i.e. K + , Ca 2+ , Na + , Mg 2+ and can induce local cell membrane hyperpolarization, facilitating endocytosis [40,95,96]. The cytoskeleton (Fig. 3) consists of microtubules combined with a diffuse actin network lining the cell membrane [97,98]. Apart from mechanotransduction, it is indispensable for the cells structural support and organization. It is also important for intracellular transport [99][100][101] by mediating endocytosis and exocytosis, via the transport of vacuoles across the cytoplasm [42,102,103].Furthermore, intracellular Ca 2+ -levels can also be increased through the opening of mechanosensitive ion-channels.

        <p>Membrane (sono)poration is also known to directly affect the cellular cytoskeleton (Fig. 3A) as pore formation shows to actively disrupt actin and tubulin networks [48,92,99,[104][105][106]. The disruption of actin, regulating the cell membrane tension (Fig. 3A), induces a direct decrease in the cell membrane tension and hence facilitates the insertion of cell membrane vesicles to repair the cell membrane pore [71]. In contrast, the microtubule disruption remains concentrated around the pore and mainly facilitates the transport of vesicles towards the membrane pore [71,107]. Overall, the less dense post-poration cytoskeleton network allows much more efficient recruitment and transport of intracellular vesicles and in this way favours pore resealing via exocytosis [48,71,82,108]. For sonoporation specifically, the direct disruptive effects on the cytoskeleton have been shown in a few reports [47,48,99]. Notably, Zeghimi and colleagues exposed human glioblastoma cells to BR-14 microbubbles and determined via confocal microscopy that around 80% to 90% of the cells restored their actin network and microtubuli within 60 min after sonoporation, leaving only few cells with a permanently disrupted cytoskeleton [47]. In addition, they also observed a drastic decrease in both endocytosis and sonoporation upon administration of cytoskeleton polymerization inhibitors, indicating that direct mechanical effects onto the cytoskeleton are indispensable for pore formation and endocytosis during sonoporation [47]. Chen, et al. used VEGF-targeted microbubbles and showed the complete collapse of the diffuse actin (F-actin) after a single pulse sonoporation. Using the more advanced structure tensor analysis method, they observed direct F-actin disruption which started at the pore site and was followed by a progressive degradation of the remaining F-actin filaments in the cell over time (Fig. 3B). The F-actin degradation speed was proportional to the PI influx and thus to the induced pore size [48]. Interestingly, they observed that the actin disruption was not necessarily restored within 60 min. Indeed, if the cells were not able to rebuild their actin network within 2 h, the postsonoporation viability started to deteriorate. The differences observed with the findings of Zeghimi, et al. might originate from the choice of ultrasound settings and microbubble type since Chen et al. used targeted microbubbles, which can strengthen the mechanical impact on the cell membrane [109]. Additionally, Chen, et al. used a more refined structure tensor analysis method analysis that provides information on the orientation and connectivity of the fibres [48,110] and is therefore more sensitive than the manual approach of Zeghimi, et al. [47]. Wang, et al. fitted the a-tubulin cytoskeleton rearrangement after sonoporation using the same analysis model as Chen, et al. and could also find a correlation between tubulin disassembly and PI influx and hence pore size [99]. They also showed that cytoskeleton disruptions did not occur without a sonoporation event. In case of sonoporation, the PI influx starts at the location where the microbubble is in close vicinity of the cell. Additionally, they showed a correlation between actin disruption and pore size with increasing acoustic pressures. However, they did not examine the long term effects and therefore did not evaluate whether the cytoskeleton was able to recover over time. In conclusion, these findings provide valuable but preliminary insights in the destructive impact of sonoporation onto the cytoskeleton and more information is needed to correctly assess the interplay between sonoporation, cytoskeleton repair dynamics and pore resealing [111].Membrane (sono)poration is also known to directly affect the cellular cytoskeleton (Fig. 3A) as pore formation shows to actively disrupt actin and tubulin networks [48,92,99,[104][105][106].

        <p>Overall, it is clear that the ultrasound induced cellular effects are very complex and many distinct processes like Ca 2+homeostasis, pore-resealing, endo-and exocytosis, and cytoskeleton organization are largely intertwined. It therefore remains particularly difficult to distinguish the sequence of the mechanisms at play. In addition, the common hypothesis that bioeffects in sonoporation are solely caused by a direct mechanical impact on the cell-membrane, might not hold [47,99]. Although the regulating role of calcium cannot be underestimated, it still remains a huge fundamental task to unravel the exact mechanisms and pathways involved in the biological responses at the cellular level. In this regard, the use of single-cell in vitro assays is indispensable to further elucidate the impact of microbubble cavitation on cell biology. To this day, it remains hard to objectively define which ultrasound settings are necessary to stimulate either endocytosis or sonoporation due to the plethora of microbubbles and acoustic setups that are used in literature.Overall, it is clear that the ultrasound induced cellular effects are very complex and many distinct processes like Ca 2+homeostasis, pore-resealing, endo-and exocytosis, and cytoskeleton organization are largely intertwined.

        <p>Another aspect that is often neglected are the long-term effects of sonoporation as most studies are limited to short-term toxicity assays. Safety-wise, the long-term effects are not well understood. In most cases, the cellular viability is only evaluated over a timeframe of 12-24 h after sonoporation and most often limited to cellular viability or proliferation assays [81]. However, the possible effect of sonoporation onto the genome, long-term function of the cytoskeleton, cell turnover time, upregulation of cellular stress-associated molecules (i.e. reactive oxygen species) is most often not investigated and therefore the general safety of sonoporation cannot be estimated by short-term cellular assays alone [20,48,114].Another aspect that is often neglected are the long-term effects of sonoporation as most studies are limited to short-term toxicity assays.

        <p>Ultrasound-driven microbubble cavitation is also frequently used to enhance the cellular or tissue-specific delivery of therapeutics in vivo. After an intravenous bolus injection, microbubbles have a circulation time of approximately 10-15 min [115,116]. This short half-life in vivo is mainly due to the fast hepatic clearance of microbubbles by Kupffer cells, a high phagocytic but heterogeneous cell population that is specialized in removing large and particulate substances from the portal circulation [117]. Kupffer cells are believed to be responsible for the removal of 80-90% of injected particles, with a turn-over time dependent on the size and shell composition of the microbubble [117][118][119][120]. The use of polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a shell constituent has improved the microbubble circulation time as it decreases interaction with serum proteins and subsequent opsonisation and can therefore decrease the immunogenicity of protein-shelled microbubbles [121,122].Ultrasound-driven microbubble cavitation is also frequently used to enhance the cellular or tissue-specific delivery of therapeutics in vivo.

        <p>Therapeutics can be either injected next to the microbubbles [123][124][125], or in some case, loaded directly onto the microbubbles, resulting in drug-loaded microbubbles [13,[126][127][128][129][130]. However, the latter has been mainly investigated in vitro for the delivery of larger drugs like nanoparticles (nanoparticle-loaded microbubbles). By loading these drugs onto microbubbles the aim is to co-localize cavitation effects and drug release to promote local delivery and increase the specificity of the treatment as well as prevent offtarget effects. The fact that microbubbles are quickly cleared from the bloodstream, as mentioned before, can be considered one of the biggest limitations of drug-loaded microbubbles as the therapeutic cargo is lost upon microbubble clearance as well [131]. Targeting ligands can also be attached to microbubbles (targeted microbubbles) either to enhance site-specific binding and retention of microbubbles for molecular imaging or to induce sitespecific mechanical effects for drug delivery purposes. As a way to overcome this short time-window, microbubbles can be injected in repeated doses or continuously infused [132,133]. The former approach has been investigated for molecular imaging by Willmann, et al. who conclude that a delay time of about 30 min is reasonable between multiple bolus injections of targeted microbubbles [120], Korpanty, et al. on the other hand used one hour intervals [134]. For drug delivery, the repeated injections of microbubbles have shown to be effective in ameliorating the therapeutic outcomes [135][136][137][138]. Sun, et al. chose the second approach and found that a slow and continuous microbubble infusion after a bolus injection enhanced the delivery of doxorubicin across the BBB in rats [123]. Kopecheck, et al. have also used continuous infusion to enhance microbubble-mediated miRNA delivery in vivo in mice [126].Therapeutics can be either injected next to the microbubbles [123][124][125], or in some case, loaded directly onto the microbubbles, resulting in drug-loaded microbubbles [13,[126][127][128][129][130].

        <p>The use of drug-loaded microbubbles to prevent off-target effects by stimulating drug release only in the ultrasound treated region is only valid when the drugs remain firmly attached to the microbubble shell. In case of nanoparticle-loaded microbubbles this largely depends on the stability of the linker-molecules that are used to couple nanoparticles to the microbubble shell. It is known that covalent linkers are much more stable than noncovalent linkers. However, the latter can be interesting as it allows attachment of cargo molecules to the microbubbles after fabrication [139]. In this regard, the use of streptavidin or avidin in combination of biotin is widely utilized in biological research as they engage a firm non-covalent binding and considered among the most stable protein-ligand complexes known [36,127,[140][141][142][143][144][145]. Both streptavidin as avidin are resistant to denaturing agents, temperature, pH and proteolytic enzymes resulting in a very stable biotin-streptavidin interaction with a half-life of about 35 h [144,146,147]. Overall, given the short circulation time of the microbubbles, the window of opportunity for enzymes or hydrolysis reactions to break down the (non-)covalent bindings is very short which makes it very unlikely that strong (non-)covalent binding strategies are broken down. From in vitro studies we know that ultrasound-mediated delivery from drug-loaded microbubbles is known to release both the microbubble shell together with the attached nanoparticle payload [55,148,149]. The ultrasoundmediated drug release in the blood stream might still induce offtarget effects if these fragments are not retained in the ultrasound treated region.The use of drug-loaded microbubbles to prevent off-target effects by stimulating drug release only in the ultrasound treated region is only valid when the drugs remain firmly attached to the microbubble shell.

        <p>The endothelial barrier is an important barrier for intravenously administered drugs as most drug targets lie beyond the vasculature and require extravasation [29,33]. Microbubbles have great potential for drug delivery across the endothelial layer: although they are retained in the bloodstream because of their size, they can be easily targeted to the endothelium and affect the vascular integrity by breaking the tight junctions between endothelial cells (Fig. 4A), which has been coined sonopermeation [65,[150][151][152][153]. This mechanism has been investigated in more depth by Helfield, et al. and Beekers et al. in vitro and relates to the opening of tight junctions as a consequence of sonoporation in (adjacent) endothelial cells [29,32]. It has been reported that these endothelial gaps can remain open for tens of minutes thereby permitting drug extravasation during a significant period of time after ultrasound treatment [29,65,154]. Beekers, et al. discovered that the opening of these endothelial gaps depends on the level of Ca 2+ -influx after sonoporation and thus on the pore size, not unlike other mechanisms like pore resealing and endocytosis [9,28,32,59,83,155,156]. It is however not clear whether Ca 2+ -influx is a direct or indirect indicator, as the pore size will largely dictate the extent of the disruption induce on the cytoskeleton, as already previously discussed [99]. Cytoskeleton disruption could have a direct impact on the tight junctions as these have a direct connection with the cytoskeleton (Fig. 4A) [93]. This also supports the findings of Beekers et al. that the gap junction integrity is severely compromised in the neighbourhood of sonoporated cells [29,32]. Our knowledge about the role of chemical components on cell and tight junction poration remains limited. For example, Kooiman, et al. have shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS) prolong the permeability of the endothelial barrier by adding the antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) [157] but the exact mechanism are not elucidated.The endothelial barrier is an important barrier for intravenously administered drugs as most drug targets lie beyond the vasculature and require extravasation [29,33].

        <p>In general, it is important to take into account that the composition of the blood vessel walls is more complex than the endothelial cell layer alone as they can also consist of additional layers of (smooth) muscle cells, extracellular matrix and connective tissue. The exact composition and blood flow velocity within the vessel depend on the size and function of the blood vessel [158][159][160] and might hence influence the ultrasound induced drug delivery. First, the diameter of the blood vessel will largely affect the behaviour of microbubbles, in smaller vessels (d = 10-20 mm) the microbubbles are more confined and close to the vessel wall and can impact the endothelial cell layer more violently than in larger blood vessels (d = 4-25 mm) [161][162][163][164][165][166][167][168][169]. Small vessels can also limit the oscillatory behaviour [166,170]. The velocity of the microbubble in the blood circulation also has a major impact onto its mechanical effects [171]. In vitro, Sennoga, et al. found that continuously flowing microbubbles were less likely to attach to the targeted receptor compared to pulsatile flow conditions [172]. Obtaining a high microbubble binding in large blood vessels that present high fluid velocities remains challenging [171,172]. The blood in smaller blood vessels flows at a reduced velocity giving the ligand-targeted microbubbles more time to attach and exert mechanical effects onto the endothelium. However, it should also be noted that a higher inflow of intact microbubbles can be expected in larger blood vessels. This has been confirmed by the fast bubble replenishment seen in larger vessels after ultrasound induced microbubble destruction, a method that is frequently used to assess the blood flow perfusion [154,[173][174][175]. It remains however very hard to estimate the impact that non-targeted cavitating microbubbles can exert on the endothelium of larger blood vessels as most experiments have focused on mechanical effects in smaller blood vessels like tumor microvasculature and blood-brain barrier [36,141,150,[176][177][178]. Finally, the complexity of the blood vessel wall composition differs between small and large vessels and will define their stress-strain characteristics [164]. The endothelium and basal layer are similar in all blood vessels and make up the main barrier in smaller capillaries [158]. The lack of smooth muscle cells makes capillaries less resistant to mechanical forces and therefore more prone to mechanical effects caused by microbubble oscillations [162,164].In general, it is important to take into account that the composition of the blood vessel walls is more complex than the endothelial cell layer alone as they can also consist of additional layers of (smooth) muscle cells, extracellular matrix and connective tissue. The exact composition and blood flow velocity within the vessel depend on the size and function of the blood vessel [158][159][160] and might hence influence the ultrasound induced drug delivery. First, the diameter of the blood vessel will largely affect the behaviour of microbubbles, in smaller vessels (d = 10-20 mm) the microbubbles are more confined and close to the vessel wall and can impact the endothelial cell layer more violently than in larger blood vessels (d = 4-25 mm) [161][162][163][164][165][166][167][168][169]. Small vessels can also limit the oscillatory behaviour [166,170]. The velocity of the microbubble in the blood circulation also has a major impact onto its mechanical effects [171].

        <p>Targeted microbubbles (Fig. 4B) have been explored to enhance the effects of microbubble cavitation on the endothelial cells of larger blood vessels or on specific sites (i.e. inflammatory or cancer regions). Targeting ligands can be coupled directly to the microbubble shell in order to trap the microbubbles at specific locations in the body [5,7,31,32,179] and to increase their mechanical impact by assuring direct contact with the endothelial barrier. Targeted microbubbles hold potential for diseases with altered endothelial signalling such as cancer or inflammatory diseases [31,171,180]. Among others, frequently targeted markers for microbubbles in the endothelium are the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) receptor, vascular adhesion molecule (VCAM), annexins and integrins (mostly a v b 3 ). Selective targeting of endothelial markers upregulated in specific cancers have also been reported [5,129,143,179,[181][182][183][184][185][186]. However, this strategy has only slightly increased microbubble retention in the body [120,187]. Off-target binding of targeted microbubbles risk to elicit unwanted sideeffects or toxicity [188]. Given the complexity of in vivo systems, off-target effects are very likely to occur [188]. For targeted microbubbles, off-target effects are defined by the stability of the antibody binding as this limits off-targets effects to intravascular receptors. The affinity of the antibody for the target and the distribution of the latter in the body contribute to the changes to observe unwanted effects [188,189]. In order to avoid off-target effects, it is key to select a receptor that is solely present at, or clearly overexpressed in the target tissue [184,185,190]. As a way to overcome off-target effects by targeted microbubbles, Borden, et al. designed a 'buried' targeting ligand covered by PEG-brushes that reveals itself upon ultrasound stimuli [187,191]. To enhance spatial selectivity, Barreiro, et al. proposed to combine multiple antibodies onto the microbubble shell if one of the used antibodies is likely to induce off-target effects [36]. More specifically the combination of two distinct antibodies could enhance the specificity of the targeted microbubbles for endothelium expressing both targets e.g. in inflamed tissue, while decreasing the binding specificity in healthy tissues where only one of the targets is present [36]. However this strategy has not been experimentally confirmed yet.Targeted microbubbles (Fig. 4B) have been explored to enhance the effects of microbubble cavitation on the endothelial cells of larger blood vessels or on specific sites (i.e. inflammatory or cancer regions).

        <p>One way to enhance microbubble-endothelial cell contact is via acoustic radiation forces (ARF), also called Bjerkness forces, where microbubbles can respond to an incoming ultrasound wave with low pressures and long pulses by moving away from the ultrasound transducer [26,180]. For a more technical explanation of these effects we can refer to other reviews in the field [7,20,192]. These acoustic effects can stimulate microbubble translation from the centre of the blood vessel towards the endothelial cells and as such increase the contact of microbubbles to the endothelial cells or specifically facilitate adherence of targeted microbubbles to their target site [26,183,[193][194][195][196]. In this context, acoustic radiation forces were initially explored in combination with targeted microbubbles in the context of molecular imaging to enhance molecular imaging sensitivity in small blood vessels in vivo [183,194,[197][198][199]. Later on, Wang, et al. also published preliminary data where ARF was used to induce the attachment of targeted microbubbles in large blood vessels [171]. A general concern is that it remains very complicated to determine the efficacy of ARF-induced microbubble attachment in vivo [183,200] as the main read-out for microbubble retainment in vivo is a gradual increase in contrast compared to the baseline, that is persistent while the ARF is turned off again [171,183]. Moreover, Gessner, et al. state that, for molecular imaging, the microbubbles should remain intact to enable this increase in contrast [197]. This is not a major issue for ARF-mediated drug delivery where the release of the payload is key. In this light, Shortencarier, et al. used ARF to locally deposit a fluorescent model drug using gas-filled lipospheres in vivo [201]. Kilroy, et al. were able to demonstrate the deposition of microbubble shell fragments onto the vessel wall when acoustic radiation forces were applied via an intravascular ultrasound probe [202]. Another in vivo ARF application are the StemBells, i.e. ICAM-1 targeted microbubbles connected to stem cells [203,204]. ARF locally enhances the binding of StemBells to inflamed endothelium in post-myocardial infarct regions to enhance stem cell engraftment and ameliorate regenerative therapy. This effectiveness of this technique was confirmed preclinically in mice and rat myocardial infarction models. However, the combination of ARF and (targeted) microbubbles for in vivo drug delivery beyond the endothelial cell layer has not been reported yet in contrast to experiments using ARF as a stand-alone technique, without co-administrated microbubbles. The latter has shown to improve the extravasation of intravenously injected macromolecular drugs to tumor and muscle tissue, which was attributed to ARF induced shear stress that would result in the opening of endothelial tight junctions [131,[205][206][207][208]. Zhao, et al. formulate that the applicability of ARF in complex vascular 3D architecture in vivo should be effective if the target region uniformly surrounds the diseased blood vessels [183]. Unfortunately, it is not possible to control the direction of the primary ARF in vivo meaning that if the targeted lesion or receptor is only present on one particular endothelial side, there is no guarantee that the ARF is directed to the correct side of the vessel [183].One way to enhance microbubble-endothelial cell contact is via acoustic radiation forces (ARF), also called Bjerkness forces, where microbubbles can respond to an incoming ultrasound wave with low pressures and long pulses by moving away from the ultrasound transducer [26,180].

        <p>When microbubbles and ultrasound are applied to increase vascular permeability for drug delivery purposes, caution should be taken to avoid more dangerous vascular bioeffects such as vascular ruptures, haemorrhages, vascular occlusion and thrombosis [7,161,209]. Vascular ruptures and haemorrhages can be caused by the microbubble cavitation [210]. Miao et al. showed that the vessel wall stress is much higher during the microbubble expansion phase then during its collapse [210]. The probability of vascular rupture highly depends on the acoustic settings (as these will govern microbubble cavitation) [16,[209][210][211] but is, in general, less likely to occur in larger and thicker vessels as they are more resistant to the induced forces [16,[209][210][211]. Another side effect that has been reported after ultrasound-mediated microbubble cavitation is vasoconstriction which can even lead to vascular occlusion in more severe cases. This phenomenon has been reported at higher acoustic intensities and mostly affects smaller vessels that are deprived of a smooth muscle layer and extracellular matrix [7,212]. This vascular shutdown can lead to haemostasis, the release of prothrombogenic factors by damaged endothelial cells and even platelet activation, all of which are involved in thrombus formation [209,212]. As a consequence, drug and oxygen delivery to tissues posterior of this occlusion is hampered, which can induce local inflammation and even necrotic ischemic damage, compromising the safety of the therapy [7]. Experiments have shown that vascular occlusion was established shortly after ultrasound treatment, indicating that it is a direct effect of microbubble cavitation. In most cases, the occlusion is reversible and flow recovers [209,213]. Overall, the resulting toxicity will depend on the on the specific location, the severity of the occlusion and the number of occluded vessels [214,215]. In sharp contrast, others have described an increased blood flow after microbubble cavitation which has been linked to release of the vasorelaxant NO, cav-itation assisted opening of clogged angiogenetic vessels in cancer lesions and a vasodilatory response onto the ultrasound-induced vasoconstriction called the 'vascular rebound' [7,209,216,217].When microbubbles and ultrasound are applied to increase vascular permeability for drug delivery purposes, caution should be taken to avoid more dangerous vascular bioeffects such as vascular ruptures, haemorrhages, vascular occlusion and thrombosis [7,161,209].

        <p>Despite the many promising results, there is only limited understanding about the direct impact of microbubbles onto the vessel wall and the mechanisms at play; in most cases, only the therapeutic effects are assessed several hours after treatment without identifying the microbubble cavitation behaviour or potential effects on blood circulation. This limits our knowledge on the efficiency and safety of ultrasound induced endothelial permeabilization. Therefore, it will be essential to combine the treatment with real-time imaging techniques like intravital microscopy or doppler imaging to assess the continuity of the blood flow directly before and after the treatment [57,218]. Passive cavitation detection used in conjunction with feedback systems offer a promising way to monitor microbubble cavitation behaviour and related safety. This topic is discussed in more depth in the technological innovations section (Section 5.2).Despite the many promising results, there is only limited understanding about the direct impact of microbubbles onto the vessel wall and the mechanisms at play; in most cases, only the therapeutic effects are assessed several hours after treatment without identifying the microbubble cavitation behaviour or potential effects on blood circulation.

        <p>The brain is one of the most difficult regions in the human body to access [219]. The blood brain barrier (BBB), a special form of the previously mentioned endothelium, is almost impermeable in order to protect the brain from toxicity caused by hazardous substances, so-called neuroprotection [33,[220][221][222]. The BBB embeds selective trans-endothelial transporter molecule [219,223]. This leads to an exceptionally controlled transport of molecules to the brain and ensures a healthy brain homeostasis. The BBB has a tremendous impact on drug delivery to the brain, since it blocks the extravasation of about 98% of small molecule drugs (&lt;600 Da) and 100% of macromolecules [33,219,220,224]. As a way to overcome this, drugs have been specifically designed to bind to brain-specific transport carriers in order to allow transcytosis towards the brain [219,220,222,225,226] and although successful, the delivery efficiency across the BBB remains quite low [227]. As an alternative, microbubbles and ultrasound have been used to temporarily open the BBB and allow passive diffusion of both, small molecular weight drugs and larger therapeutics such as nanomedicines and antibodies. The BBB is composed of neurovascular units (NVU) which consists of endothelial cells, pericytes, astrocytes and neurons (Fig. 5A) [20,228]. The most important reason for BBB associated impermeability is the presence of very specific tight-junctions (zonulae occludentes) in between the endothelial cells whose role is to restrict intracellular transport (Fig. 5A) [223,226,[229][230][231][232][233]. As an additional physical barrier, the BBB endothelial cells express a high number of P-glycoprotein efflux pumps (P gp ) that are continuously pumping drug molecules back into the vasculature if these were able to diffuse into the endothelial lumen [234]. The pericytes and astrocyte-feet that are surrounding the endothelial cells are indispensable for keeping the BBB intact but are believed to not pose any physical restrictions themselves [228,229]. The biological function of pericytes is to induce BBB-specific genetic expression in endothelial cells, i.e. inducing tight junction formation and reducing gap junctions on the endothelial surface thereby limiting BBB permeability [228,235]. Additionally, pericytes are indispensable for the functionality and the integrity of the NVU [230]. The brain essentially consists of neurons that are surrounded by neuroglial cells to with a regulatory function such as like astrocytes [229,236,237]. Astrocytes are also responsible for the regulation of the vascular smooth muscle cells in the brain. By either inducing dilatation or constriction, astrocytes control brain perfusion which is crucial regulate the supply of nutrients and oxygen [223,237]. Astrocytes are also known to communicate via calcium waves and function as the bridge between neural and endothelial cells [83,84,235,238]. To minimize the neurotoxic effects of BBB permeabilization, it is therefore important to restrict the mechanical effects to the endothelial tight junctions and safeguard the underlying components of the NVU [239].The brain is one of the most difficult regions in the human body to access [219].

        <p>Ultrasound has shown tremendous potential for the temporal opening of the BBB and allows the extravasation of (chemo)therapeutics leading to significantly enhancing the bioavailability of therapeutics in the brain [6,152,[240][241][242]. The concept is very appealing as it can stimulate drug delivery to the brain in a noninvasive, non-surgical way [243]. Many ultrasound-based techniques have been investigated to specifically induce BBB disruption (BBBD). Permeabilization of the BBB has been established using unfocused or focused ultrasound in combination with microbubbles or targeted-microbubbles. Importantly, inducing controlled ultrasound-mediated bioeffects on the blood brain barrier requires finely tuned and specifically chosen ultrasound parameters to penetrate the skull and expose the underlying brain tissue with accurate precision, which constitutes the first obstacle.Ultrasound has shown tremendous potential for the temporal opening of the BBB and allows the extravasation of (chemo)therapeutics leading to significantly enhancing the bioavailability of therapeutics in the brain [6,152,[240][241][242].

        <p>Ultrasound is able to penetrate through the skull but the pressure amplitude of MHz waves used in medical ultrasound is largely attenuated owing to both, the inhomogeneous and porous structure of the skull itself and the large impedance mismatch between the bone and soft tissues [244,245]. Clinical transducer are specifically designed for optimal transmission through soft tissue but not through bones. In addition, the curvature and inhomogeneity of the skull further lead to a degradation of the beam shape [231,244,[246][247][248] and complicate the creation of a sharp focal spot presenting a controlled pressure. Altogether, this results in an estimated transmission coefficient of only about 14% in humans and 50% in rats [3,245,249]. In order to induce mechanical effects at the BBB interface, the first hurdle is to optimize the ultrasound beam profile to ensure maximal precision, sufficient ultrasound energy and minimize acoustic reflections [245]. This has given rise to the development of, first, time reversal approach and later to patient-specific ultrasound beam profiling based on patientspecific, 3D scanning of the skull as the skull shape and structure strongly differs from patient to patient [231,247,248,[250][251][252][253]. The acoustic properties of the skull, as well as the precise tumor margins can be deducted from high-resolution scans like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) and used during ultrasound treatment as well [231,247,251,252,254,255]. Based on these scan, the focal areas can be precisely defined to avoid collateral damage in vital areas of the brain. The approach remains, nonetheless, cumbersome. Note that lower frequencies (on the order of 300 kHz) penetrate the skull much more efficiently [256,257], but are poorly suited to the excitation of microbubbles.Ultrasound is able to penetrate through the skull but the pressure amplitude of MHz waves used in medical ultrasound is largely attenuated owing to both, the inhomogeneous and porous structure of the skull itself and the large impedance mismatch between the bone and soft tissues [244,245].

        <p>Ultrasound-mediated drug delivery across the BBB is the result of the disruption of the most important physiological barrier in the BBB, being the tight junctions (Fig. 5A). Cavitation nuclei are able to reversibly induce BBB disruption, without inducing intense and irreversible brain damage [239]. In particular, microbubble cavitation in close proximity to the BBB endothelium can lead to the direct disruption of the tight junctions [239]. Subsequently, the BBB remains open for a couple of hours after treatment before resealing [239,260,261]. This temporary disruption has been confirmed, among others, by Sheikov, et al. via the disappearance of the most prominent proteins that make up the tight junction [223,233,239]. They report the loss of immunosignals for occludins and claudins up to 4 h post ultrasound treatment and their gradual restoration after 6 h [239,260]. Apart from tight junction disruption, microbubble cavitation in close proximity of the BBB endothelium can lead to two other, less studied, biological effects that can enhance the bioavailability of therapeutics in the tumor cells [239]. First, an enhanced transport of vacuoles through the endothelial cell lumen has been reported [261,262]. Secondly, a temporarily reduction of the P-glycoprotein efflux pumps has also been reported and can last for several days [7,232,234]. This reduction has been shown to drastically enhance the drug delivery of small molecular weight drugs across the BBB endothelium, although the exact mechanism is still unclear.Ultrasound-mediated drug delivery across the BBB is the result of the disruption of the most important physiological barrier in the BBB, being the tight junctions (Fig. 5A). Cavitation nuclei are able to reversibly induce BBB disruption, without inducing intense and irreversible brain damage [239]. In particular, microbubble cavitation in close proximity to the BBB endothelium can lead to the direct disruption of the tight junctions [239]. Subsequently, the BBB remains open for a couple of hours after treatment before resealing [239,260,261]. This temporary disruption has been confirmed, among others, by Sheikov, et al. via the disappearance of the most prominent proteins that make up the tight junction [223,233,239]. They report the loss of immunosignals for occludins and claudins up to 4 h post ultrasound treatment and their gradual restoration after 6 h [239,260].

        <p>Targeted microbubbles can be used to enhance microbubble contact with the BBB as well and allow disease-targeted BBB opening [242,245]. Ideally, the targeting ligands are directed to a target that is only expressed by the brain endothelium (i.e. Transferrin receptor (TfR) or growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR)), but in most cases aspecific endothelial ligands are used and the loss of spatial selectivity is compensated by focusing the ultrasound wave in the region of interest [178,263]. The disruption of the tight junctions drastically enhances the bioavailability of both small molecular drugs (chemotherapeutics, MRI contrast agents like Gadolinium (Gd), etc.) and macromolecular drugs (i.e. FITC dextrans (Fig. 5C) or antibodies, pDNA, adenoviruses and even stem cells) in the brain [231,239,258,[264][265][266][267][268][269][270]. Last year, two first-in-human clinical trials have proven that chemotherapeutics could be safely delivered across the BBB in patients diagnosed with a primary brain tumor just as Gd in ALS patients (Fig. 5B) using MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRIgFUS) [259,271]. These findings stress the feasibility and potential of ultrasound-mediated drug delivery in the brain. Its efficacy is currently being further investigated in ongoing clinical trials.Targeted microbubbles can be used to enhance microbubble contact with the BBB as well and allow disease-targeted BBB opening [242,245].

        <p>To allow safe and reversible BBB opening, two important biological effects elicited by ultrasound should be taken into account: vascular damage and neuroinflammation. As mentioned earlier, it has been reported that inertial cavitation of microbubbles can induce both haemorrhages, due to vessel rupture, or clot formation [272]. Red blood cell (RBC) extravasation is an important indicator for vascular disruption [239]. In most preclinical and clinical studies, no vascular damage substantial enough to induce neurotoxicity has been reported. Although minor RBC extravasations (in the form of petechiae) have been detected, they are not believed to compromise the safety of the ultrasound treatment since apoptosis and ischemia were not observed [239,273,274]. Very recently, neuroinflammation has become an important topic of debate when Kovacs, et al. described a sterile inflammatory response after BBB disruption which was very similar to the effects seen during brain ischemia or in mild traumatic brain injuries [275]. The mechanical injury provoked by ultrasound resulted in the transcytosis of plasma proteins like albumin into the brain. In turn, this infiltration induced the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines promoting the onset of inflammation followed by the recruitment of peripheral immune cells [275][276][277][278]. This inflammation subsequently affected the brain parenchyma, the previously described neurovascular units network. Additionally, several studies have demonstrated that either the number of astrocytes are reduced or that astrocytes are activated after microbubble-induced BBB. Both are highly unfavourable as they lead to neurotoxicological effects. The loss of astrocytes in the brain directly compromises the well-regulated function of the NVU and hence the survival of the associated neurons [279]. Astrocyte activation, on the other hand, gives rise to a pro-inflammatory astrocyte (A1) subtype that releases proinflammatory cytokines and as such triggers neurotoxicological effects on adjacent neurons [235,280]. Similarly in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease, Parkinson disease and Multiples Sclerosis, the presence of reactive A1 astrocytes are associated with a bad prognosis [235,281,282]. Astrocyte activation is detectable for a more extended period than the BBB opening itself: days to weeks [152,268,283,284]. This longterm effect is caused by astrocyte activation and subsequent neural degeneration far beyond the initially damaged site and aggravates the neural damage associated to BBB opening [277,278,285]. The central nervous system is indeed known for its poor regenerative capacity, frequently leading to irreversible damage and, in the worst case, to chronic inflammation or so-called persisting or dysregulated inflammation [277,278]. Chronic inflammation plays a fundamental role in the onset and pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases [277], and might be a risk after BBB opening [286]. As astrocytes and adjacent neurons are indispensable for the brain's functionality, assessment on the level of astrocyte activation and inflammation in these regions are critical to assess the safety of BBB opening. As a response to these findings, McMahon, et al. stated that when lower microbubble concentrations were used, in the range of clinical imaging doses, the real-time monitoring of the BBB disruption process was less disturbed [287]. Their improvement of the acoustic feedback loop allowed better control of the BBB opening and safety and thereby drastically reduced the inflammation caused by the procedure. Later, Kovacs, et al. could prove that the long-term (7-13 weeks) effects of single treatment may be minimal, but the effects of repeated treatments were severe and consistent with symptoms that correspond to pathological trauma injuries i.e. vascular damage, inflammation and neurodegeneration [288]. Additionally, the administration of dexamethasone after the treatment has shown to reduce the risk of inflammation-induced tissue damage caused by BBB opening, at least preclinically [289]. In general, determining the astrocyte activation and the sterile inflammation levels remains an important aspect in assessing the neurotoxic effects of any (ultrasound) therapy targeting the brain, especially in case of repeated treatments. An exact comparison of the current BBB disrupting approaches is rather complicated due to the wide variety of microbubbles, transducers and ultrasound settings used. Therefore, new-emerging acoustic feedback loops will be essential to better understand and control the impact of microbubble cavitation onto the BBB, provided that these feedback loops are based on a relevant measure of the bioeffect of microbubbles.

        <p>Targeting cancer lesions remains a tremendous challenge in oncology as many hurdles have to be overcome to reach the tumor tissue. In fact, for intravenously injected drugs, the endothelium is only the first barrier to be overcome. In many preclinical cancer studies, it has been demonstrated that encapsulating drugs in nanosized vesicles leads to their specific extravasation from the circulation to the tumor region thereby reducing off-target sideeffects [6,29,291,292]. This enhanced permeation and retention effect (EPR) is believed to be a result of endothelial malfunction. More specifically, in newly growing tissues that require a fast supply of nutrition and oxygen, new and quickly formed blood vessels fail to form a healthy endothelium with aligned cells. This missalignment results in tiny gaps in between endothelial cells, which enables the passage of vesicles smaller than 100 nm [26,[291][292][293][294][295]. Despite the promising preclinical results, this EPR effect has not been seen in human clinical trials or is highly dependent on the tumor type [291,292]. Nevertheless, once drug molecules have passed the endothelium, they need to pass through the interstitium to reach the tumor cells (also known as, the tumor microenvironment or TME), which can further hamper their therapeutic effects at the tumor site. Viable tumor cells are mostly located at the periphery of the tumor and can thrive at a distance of up to 150-200 mm away from the nearest vascular region, which is ~5 times more than normal cells. This longer distance constitutes an even stronger barrier if the aim is to treat the complete tumor [37,296]. The TME consists of a dense biological matrix that hosts different physiological processes that support the development, progression and metastasis of embedded tumor cells [297,298]. The TME is difficult to penetrate for multiple reasons, but the most important is the rigid extracellular matrix (ECM). This matrix is composed of dense matrix constituents such as proteins, glycoproteins, proteoglycans and polysaccharides combined with various types of tumor growth supportive cells such as stromal cells, cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), pericytes and immune cells although huge intertumoral variations exist [293,297]. In general, the cellular composition of the tumor itself largely dictates the ECM composition as they secrete distinct ECM proteins [297]. The ECM has a dual role in tumor development: it provides a physical frame and isolates tumor cells from the environment, but also nourishes the tumor with growth factors and nutrients [293,299]. The ECM drastically hinders nanoparticle transport as larger particles are not able to penetrate through the tiny fenestrae within the crosslinked matrix constituents [300]. In addition, the TME has a high interstitial fluid pressure (IFP), a combined result of reduced lymphatic drainage in the tumor and dense matrix, that can also hamper the convection of smaller drugs as well as prevents immune cells from infiltrating [26,293,[301][302][303][304][305][306].Targeting cancer lesions remains a tremendous challenge in oncology as many hurdles have to be overcome to reach the tumor tissue.

        <p>Other characteristics of the TME are an acidic pH, irregular enzyme levels, altered metabolic pathways and last but not least hypoxia [297]. As the tumor cells continuously proliferate, tumor regions that are further away from the vasculature (&gt;150-200 m m) receive less nutrients and oxygen than they would normally consume. This leads to hypoxic regions that release stress signals to induce the formation of new angiogenetic blood vessels to reestablish oxygen and nutrient supply [301]. However, when the tumor growth rate is much faster than the speed of angiogenesis, the hypoxic regions will continue to lack the required supplies and further evolve into necrotic tumor regions [296,302,307]. Upon necrosis, the cells grow and expel their intracellular content to be used as nutrients for the anaerobic metabolism of the surrounding cells [307,308]. The hypoxic TME thereby leads to a natural selection process in the tumor population and only the cells that are most resistant to hypoxia and necrotic cell death will remain [307]. As these cells proliferate at a much slower pace they are also more resistant to chemotherapeutics that mainly act on fast-dividing cells. They are therefore, counterintuitively, considered more aggressive and will worsen the cancer prognosis [301,302,307,309,310]. Moreover, tumor oxygenation is important for several anticancer treatments like radiotherapy or specific chemotherapeutics (i.e. doxorubicin (DOX), platinum complexes, alkylating agents, topoisomerase inhibitors, camptothecins and arsenic agents) as their mode of action depends on the formation of free radicals and reactive oxygen species [309,[311][312][313][314][315]. Altogether, when the tumor core is hypoxic or necrotic, less or no oxygen is present and as a result the tumor-killing potency of radiotherapy and chemotherapeutics can be drastically reduced [301]. Lastly, tumor hypoxia is also known to suppresses the anti-tumoral activity of tumor resident and infiltrating immune cells [302]. In summary, only small amounts of the administered drug are able to reach the tumor cells and their therapeutic activity is heavily hampered, which increases the risk of drug resistance [297].Other characteristics of the TME are an acidic pH, irregular enzyme levels, altered metabolic pathways and last but not least hypoxia [297].

        <p>Ultrasound and microbubbles have received a lot of attention to aid in TME penetration and actively promote drug delivery to the tumor [9,[316][317][318]. Microbubble cavitation has been investigated to actively cross the endothelium but the exact mechanical effects on the underlying tumor microenvironment remain largely unexplored [302]. However, several groups have clearly demonstrated that cavitation can increase intratumoral drug concentrations of both small molecules as chemotherapeutic-encapsulated nanomedicines (Fig. 6A) [7,35,141,150,152,153,313,[319][320][321][322][323]. Later, also the delivery of immunomodulating proteins such as cytokines and antibodies into the tumor has been explored [321,[324][325][326]. The main read-out for therapeutic efficacy are the decrease in primary tumor volumes and overall survival, which does not provide direct knowledge about the exact mechanism for the enhanced antitumoral effect of microbubbles [131,141,322,[327][328][329]. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the observed effects are caused by enhanced sonopermeation, enhanced TME penetration, a combination of the two or even by other biological responses that are still not known. As mentioned before, tumor hypoxia can result in the formation of necrotic tumor regions and as such feed therapeutic resistance. In short, angiogenetic blood vessels, especially around hypoxic regions, are often disorganized, branched and very tortuous [26,311]. Many preclinical and clinical observations have observed that only about half of the newly formed blood vessels in tumors are supporting blood flow leading to a deficient supply of nutrients and oxygen, thereby enhancing hypoxia [309,324]. The oxygen transported towards the tumor capillaries is too scarce to oxygenate all the tumor cells and hence mainly supply the nearest ones. Oxygen filled microbubbles have therefore been explored to restore tumor oxygenation and normalize malfunctioning blood vessels to prevent therapeutic resistance [302,[309][310][311]313]. Through microbubble cavitation, the dissolved oxygen encapsulated in the core of the microbubble is locally released in the tumor vasculature and can subsequently diffuse int the TME to support TME oxygenation [311,313,330]. Oxygen supply can sustain hypoxic cells for a longer period of time, thereby avoiding tumor necrosis [302]. As oxygen supply also lead to tumor microvasculature normalization, this can guarantee a more effective drug transport towards the tumor as was already shown in case of DOX (Fig. 6B) [302,313]. It is thus advantageous for both drug delivery and nutrients towards the tumor cells. Finally, the re-oxygenation of sections of the TME promotes the infiltration and activation of immune cells, which can have an impact on the immunosuppressive nature of the TME [302].Ultrasound and microbubbles have received a lot of attention to aid in TME penetration and actively promote drug delivery to the tumor [9,[316][317][318].

        <p>As an alternative for microbubbles (Fig. 7A), nanodroplets and nanocups have emerged as nanosized ultrasound contrast agents. Nanodroplets (Fig. 7B) consist of a superheated liquid, prone to turn into a gas bubble [6] upon ultrasound exposure [331]. Once turned into microbubbles, the response to ultrasound and hence their ability to aid in drug delivery is comparable to that of microbubble contrast agents [332]. The concept behind the use of nanodroplets is based on their capacity to extravasate owing to their small size (nm range), initially through the EPR effect. Once turned into microbubbles, they enable ultrasound-induced sonopermeation and cavitation effects at the TME level [6,20,291,292]. Additionally, as nanodroplets are considered to be longercirculating, the continuous replenishment is expected to result in a more sustained effect as successive ultrasound treatments can (re-)induce their vaporization both in the vasculature as within the TME [332,333] and, as a result, induce sustained mechanical damage to the ECM and tumor cells [150,332,334].

        <p>have been loaded with chemotherapeutics like paclitaxel or doxorubicin and have shown to enhance the bioavailability of these chemotherapeutics at the tumor site [327,[334][335][336].. Altogether, it will be essential to identify the exact mechanism for the observed anti-cancer effects associated with nanodroplet treatments and thoroughly evaluating the safety of this technique in order to estimate the potential in cancer therapy [332]. Another example of nanosized contrast agents is the use of nanocups (Fig. 7C). Instead of consisting of a superfluidic core, these nanocups have a signature cup-shape with a hydrophobic cavity (230-320 nm in size) that captures gas and shield it from surface tension [337,338]. Upon ultrasound exposure, this nanobubble can cavitate and form a large microbubble. The advantage of the nanocup is twofold. First, nano-sized vehicles circulate much longer than microbubbles. Secondly, lower ultrasound energies are required to form a gas bubble compared to nanodroplets. This gas bubble is not surrounded by a shell on which to load the therapeutic. So far, these cups therefore require the co-administration of the therapeutics. Kwan, et al. reported the successful delivery of fluorescent IgG-antibodies into tumor xenografts using ultrasound-responsive nanocups [337].have been loaded with chemotherapeutics like paclitaxel or doxorubicin and have shown to enhance the bioavailability of these chemotherapeutics at the tumor site [327,[334][335][336].. Altogether, it will be essential to identify the exact mechanism for the observed anti-cancer effects associated with nanodroplet treatments and thoroughly evaluating the safety of this technique in order to estimate the potential in cancer therapy [332].

        <p>In summary, microbubbles (and analogues) in combination with ultrasound have shown to be an effective method to deliver therapeutics and oxygen to the tumor tissue in preclinical models. Unfortunately, the tumor environment of preclinical murine cancer models using fast growing xenografts differs from that of slow growing tumors that are mostly found in humans. This could explain the huge differences in terms of blood vessels organization [291,340]. In particular, the composition of the ECM found in human tumors is much thicker and denser to the ECM of in preclinical murine models [293,341]. Despite promising preclinical results on mice, these matters complicate the clinical translation of the microbubble-enhanced drug delivery to tumors which is very likely to also depend on tumor type [342]. Therefore, clinical trials are essential to fully estimate the potential and feasibility of cavitation nuclei for drug delivery in humans. A first clinical trial by Dimcevski, et al. has shown promising results in pancreatic cancer patients in which chemotherapeutic gemcitabine was coadministered with microbubbles. They noticed that half of the patients showed a partial decrease in tumor size after ultrasound exposure [343]. However, additional experiments are necessary to confirm these findings. Unfortunately, cavitation activity was not monitored during treatment there and the damage on tumorassociated blood vessels and tumor micro-environment was not assessed. Therefore, although the trial was considered successful, the exact biological effects causing the decrease in tumor size still need to be elucidated. It is therefore indispensable that new clinical trials implement real-time imaging techniques to monitor the microbubble behaviour as well as adequate treatment controls to allow a correct and relevant assessment in a clinical setting. The combined effect of chemotherapy and microbubble-assisted ultrasound therapy in cancer patients will soon be further confirmed as new clinical trials have been announced and are currently recruiting participants (NCT03458975, NCT03477019, NCT04146441).In summary, microbubbles (and analogues) in combination with ultrasound have shown to be an effective method to deliver therapeutics and oxygen to the tumor tissue in preclinical models.

        <p>On top of the TME barrier, tumor cells have additional defence mechanisms to decrease the effect of drugs molecules as well. Just as the BBB endothelium, tumor cells highly express the P gp -efflux and by extension other transporter-based efflux pumps (e.g. Breast Cancer Resistance Protein or BCRP, multidrug resistance-associated protein or MRP-1) are found in cancer cell membranes [344,345]. These drug efflux pumps constitute an additional barrier that drug molecules must overcome, provided that they have passed the three previous barriers (endothelium, TME and the cell mem-brane). Here again, feeding multidrug resistance is a real risk [234,300,344].On top of the TME barrier, tumor cells have additional defence mechanisms to decrease the effect of drugs molecules as well.

        <p>The immune system is crucial in the occurrence or defeat of a wide variety of diseases caused by both exogenous intruders (bacteria and viruses) and endogenous irregularities (cancer and autoimmune diseases). Cancer immunotherapy covers diverse strategies to overcome immune tolerance and re-activate and boost the adaptive immune system to specifically detect and attack cancer cells. This allows to selectively tackle the primary tumor as well as metastatic niches while enabling a more selective treatment than conventional chemotherapy [270]. Although, the immune system as such cannot be considered as a real physical barrier, several studies have shown that therapeutic ultrasound can spark the immune system in order to restore the balance between immune activation and immunosuppression. Immunotherapy includes a number of approaches ranging from dendritic cell based vaccination strategies, to autologous T cell transfusion and checkpoint inhibition therapy. Within this section we will summarize how therapeutic ultrasound has been used to impact each of these levels, as illustrated in Fig. 8.The immune system is crucial in the occurrence or defeat of a wide variety of diseases caused by both exogenous intruders (bacteria and viruses) and endogenous irregularities (cancer and autoimmune diseases).

        <p>A first approach relates to the concept of dendritic-cell based cancer immunotherapy. Dendritic cells are the most potent antigen presenting cells (APCs) and are highly efficient in generating adaptive immune responses, provided that 2 criteria are fulfilled. First, the antigen presenting cells (APCs) need to be able to take up or express tumor associated antigens (TAAs) and subsequently present them to T-cells. For an effective anti-cancer response, a cytotoxic-T-cell response is essential and therefore the antigen should be preferably presented via MHC-I complexes (Fig. 8B) to induce proliferation of CD8 T-cells [22,346]. Secondly, while coming across these antigens, the APCs need to sense ''danger" in order to mature and present the engulfed antigens in the presence of costimulatory signals to induce a powerful immune reaction [22]. Bioley, et al. report the uptake of antigen-loaded microbubbles by phagocytic APCs in both in vitro and in vivo and suggest that antigen loaded microbubbles can selectively delivery TAAs to phagocytic APCs without sonoporation [347,348]. Another, more active approach that has been investigated by Dewitte, et al. is the sonoporation of APCs in the presence of TAA encoding mRNA loaded microbubbles. The main advantage of this strategy is that mRNA transfection of APCs leads to the endogenous production of the TAA, which favours MHC-I presentation [22,318,324,346,[349][350][351][352]. Phagolysosomal uptake of TAAs on the contrary mainly promotes MHC-II presentation which elicit less effective cytotoxic T-cells reponses. More specifically, the transfusion of in vitro transfected APCs was able to induce tumor regression due to an effective induction of antigen-specific cytotoxic T-cells [22]. In a follow-up study, intradermal injections of mRNA loaded microbubbles were shown to migrate towards the lymph nodes. Although only a small fraction of the injected microbubbles was able to migrate, this strategy could be used for in vivo targeting of APCs and proved to be a potentially viable alternative to the current labor-intensive ex vivo dendritic cell therapies [53]. Later on, the ultrasound-induced lymphatic delivery of TAAs was achieved with antigen-loaded microbubbles. These microbubbles, injected subcutaneously in close proximity of lymph nodes, increased the number of antigen-specific cytotoxic T-cells in mice [353]. Direct targeting of APCs in vivo holds many benefits for the immune response, beyond the technical ease; the in vivo transfection of APCs allows to target multiple subsets and can thus lead to a broader immune response [349]. Sonoporation could also be useful to give TAAs direct access to the cellular cytoplasm and stimulate MHC-I presentation. Therapeutically, the successful delivery of antigen peptides, pDNA and mRNA in dendritic cells has been reported through sonoporation leading to a supressed tumor growth a mice xenograft models [22,324,352,354,355]. In a similar study, tumor suppression was shown by sonoporating DCs with IL-12 encoding pDNA, a cytokine that is known to stimulate T cell differentiation [356].A first approach relates to the concept of dendritic-cell based cancer immunotherapy.

        <p>A major restriction of dendritic cell-based immunotherapy is its requirement for tumor associated antigens, information that is not available for all cancers. Neo-antigen based vaccination is then an interesting alternative, as it could elicit stronger immune responses compared to shared tumor antigens. Neo-antigens are indeed mutated immunogenic proteins that are solely expressed by the tumor cells and come with an exceptional tumor specificity [357][358][359]. However, a major drawback of neo-antigens for vaccination is their patient-specific nature, requiring tumor sampling and antigen manufacturing. The development of novel strategies that allow the in situ release of tumor associated antigens would therefore be highly welcome as this creates an unbiased antigen and neo-antigens source. High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has been clinically employed as a thermal and mechanical tumor ablation technique. Only recently, its potential in the context of cancer immunotherapy has been suggested. HIFU-induced cell death can trigger the release of TAAs as well as the release of speci-fic intracellular compounds, the so-called damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMPs) that acts as danger signals. Both are essential to initiate tumor specific immune reactions and can lead to a hot, inflamed TME [360][361][362]. These observations have also spiked the interest in HIFU as an adjuvant therapy for other more conventional cancer therapies, such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy [361,363].A major restriction of dendritic cell-based immunotherapy is its requirement for tumor associated antigens, information that is not available for all cancers.

        <p>Very recently, ultrasound has also been explored in the context of autologous T-cell transfusion. Currently three (CAR) T-cell products have been approved by the FDA [364,365]. These cell therapy products are obtained via ex vivo engineering of patient-derived Tcells in order to equip them with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). The procedure entails withdrawing T-cells from the patient, subsequent ex vivo engineering and expansion and, finally, reinfused in the patient. In a nutshell, the CAR T-cell receptor is a fusion protein composed out of two main compartments. One segment of the protein facilitates TAA recognition while the other part allows activation of cytolysis, inducing immediate cell death [366,367] The binding of the PD-1 receptor of the cytotoxic T-cell with the PD-L1 ligand present on the tumor cell leads to the suppression of the direct tumor cell killing and aids in tumor cell survival and its persistence against the immune system. The administration of immune cell checkpoint blocking antibodies leads to blockages of this pathways and allows immune cells to directly kill the tumor cells in an antigen-specific way. In various ways, microbubbles are also used to enhance the penetration of PD-L1 antibodies locally at the tumor site. [367,368]. The drawback of the current approaches is that CAR Tcells are mostly produced using viral vectors which often results in variable outcomes and entails the risk of insertional mutagenesis [367,369,370]. Therefore, other non-viral transfection methods such as electroporation, photoporation and, to a lesser extent, sonoporation have been explored to transfect T-cells ex vivo (Fig 8C ). T-cells are known to be difficult to transfect cells due to their limited phagocytic activity. Sonoporation has been shown to allow successful delivery of fluorescent siRNA into T-cells as a proof-of-concept study [371]. One paper has reported that peripheral blood withdrawn Tregs, the regulatory and suppressor T-cell subtype, could be transfected ex vivo with microbubble-loaded Foxp3-miRNA and re-infused to effectively suppress tumor growth in mice [324,372]. Future studies could focus on the in vivo sonoporation of T-cells by making use of T-cell targeted microbubbles, which has not been evaluated up till now.Very recently, ultrasound has also been explored in the context of autologous T-cell transfusion.

        <p>One of the main hurdles in cancer immunotherapy is the plethora of immunosuppressive mechanisms present in tumors [373,374]. Next to the release of immunosuppressive cytokines by pro-tumoral immune cells, immune checkpoints specifically serve as brakes of the immune system [359]. This discovery has been awarded with the Noble prize for medicine in 2018 [375,376]. Checkpoint inhibitors ensure that the immune system is sufficiently engaged in attacking foreign microorganisms while avoiding the excessive activation that can lead to autoimmune destruction of healthy cells and tissues. It is well-known that tumor cells exert immunosuppression through the expression of immune checkpoints like the programmed cell death(ligand) PD-1/PD-L1 axis (Fig. 8D) [374,377] and the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) [378][379][380]. As a consequence, the increased numbers of antigen specific cytotoxic T-cells acquired by previously mentioned approaches (Fig. 8) does not necessarily lead to persistent anti-tumoral effects: T-cell activity is impeded by the strong negative feedback established by the checkpoint inhibitors [297,349,373,381,382]. By combining cancer immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors, the immune system could again fully participate in tumor eradication. Today, many patients have been treated with a synergistic combination of checkpoint blocking inhibitors and chemotherapeutics or other immunotherapy strategies [374][375][376][377]. Microbubbles and ultrasound have been used to locally enhance the penetration of these checkpoint inhibitors in the TME and also display comparable synergistic effects [383,384]. Additionally, Eranki, et al. show great potential in combining mechanical HIFU and checkpoint-inhibitors PD-L1 and CTLA-4 as this significantly improved survival in a previously immunologically unresponsive neuroblastoma [362]. Moreover, the described nanocups described above are specifically fabricated to enhance the tumoral delivery of co-administrated therapeutics, including antibodies, towards the tumor site and could therefore also be promising to specifically enhance the delivery of checkpoint antibodies [338].One of the main hurdles in cancer immunotherapy is the plethora of immunosuppressive mechanisms present in tumors [373,374].

        <p>Yet, a distinct number of cancer patients does not benefit from the advances made in field of immunotherapy as the systemic administration of immunomodulatory antibodies has shown to induce severe inflammation and auto-immunity in numerous organs [373,374,385,386]. The local delivery of checkpoint antibodies has been shown to be extremely useful to alleviate undesired side-effects and improve therapeutic success [385,387]. Local delivery of CTLA-4 antibodies has not been investigated yet but cavitation nuclei have been engaged to enhance the local delivery of PD-L1 antibodies in the tumor. The aim is to reduce the observed side-effects, by enhancing the penetration and delivery at the desired site of action [385]. For example, PD-L1 targeted microbubbles loaded with docetaxel have been recently investigated to decrease the off-target toxicity of PD-L1 antibodies in the treatment of lung cancer [374]. Also, microbubbles loaded with pDNA encoding for PD-1 have been successfully in delivering the compound to the tumors and stimulating antitumor immunity, leading to tumor growth suppression in a cervical cancer model in mice [388].Yet, a distinct number of cancer patients does not benefit from the advances made in field of immunotherapy as the systemic administration of immunomodulatory antibodies has shown to induce severe inflammation and auto-immunity in numerous organs [373,374,385,386].

        <p>Currently, clinically approved microbubbles have a very broad size distribution ranging from 1 to 10 mm, although the exact size distribution is specific for each formulation [61][62][63]. For microbubble-assisted drug delivery, it is important to understand that the size of the microbubbles will largely impact its cavitation behaviour and thus the mechanical and biological effects it can elicit upon exposure to a specific ultrasound frequency. Indeed, microbubbles (with radius R 0 ) have a specific resonance frequency (F res ) that roughly obey Minnaert's law: F res . R 0 % 3.3. As a result, most microbubbles will respond sub-optimally or remain largely unaffected by the ultrasound wave and, hence, only result in additional ultrasound attenuation without generation of contrast or bioeffects. This complicates the description of microbubble response to ultrasound [7,389,390]. Recently microfluidic production techniques for microbubbles have been established that allow the production of monodisperse microbubbles [389,390]. This allows to tune microbubble size to the desired application or ultrasound excitation frequency. Since these monodisperse microbubbles can guarantee a more consistent microbubble behaviour they could make cavitation-based therapies much more predictable and efficient. Helbert, et al. showed that the use of monodisperse microbubbles in rats and guinea pigs resulted in an imaging sensitivity (mean echo power per injected bubble) that was at least 10 and 15 times higher in rats and pigs, respectively, compared to the polydisperse control [391]. These findings imply that the use of monodisperse microbubbles is promising for diagnostic but also therapeutic applications. On a fundamental level, these monodisperse microbubbles could greatly improve our understanding of cavitation-induced bio-effects. Removing the size as a major confounding factor will allow us to study the biological response of a well-defined cavitation profile, thereby simplifying the interpretation of biological assays or real-time imaging experiments.Currently, clinically approved microbubbles have a very broad size distribution ranging from 1 to 10 mm, although the exact size distribution is specific for each formulation [61][62][63].

        <p>Additionally, improving our understanding and control of the interplay between ultrasound, microbubble cavitation and biological effects remains essential for clinical translation [392,393]. It therefore also requires real-time treatment monitoring to assess its effectiveness and to adjust treatment during the procedure [393]. For the time being, ultrasound-mediated therapies are combined with other techniques such as MRI thermometry, CT or invasive thermocouple probes to allow treatment monitoring [394][395][396][397], which constitutes a costly setup for clinical practice. More importantly, heat deposition is an indirect effect of bubble activity, inducing macroscopic changes in the tissue structure, which are in most cases not directly linked to local microbubble cavitation activity. The monitoring methods focused on thermal measurement are therefore adequate for monitoring intensive thermal ablation therapies [393,398], but not suited for drug delivery applications. Moreover, as secondary biological effects are monitored, local cavitation activity in vivo, in relation to the ultrasound conditions, remains unchecked. As a way to overcome this, cavitation detection has been implemented in experimental setups to enhance the control and understanding of the conducted experiments [7,15,27,399].Additionally, improving our understanding and control of the interplay between ultrasound, microbubble cavitation and biological effects remains essential for clinical translation [392,393]. It therefore also requires real-time treatment monitoring to assess its effectiveness and to adjust treatment during the procedure [393]. For the time being, ultrasound-mediated therapies are combined with other techniques such as MRI thermometry, CT or invasive thermocouple probes to allow treatment monitoring [394][395][396][397], which constitutes a costly setup for clinical practice. More importantly, heat deposition is an indirect effect of bubble activity, inducing macroscopic changes in the tissue structure, which are in most cases not directly linked to local microbubble cavitation activity. The monitoring methods focused on thermal measurement are therefore adequate for monitoring intensive thermal ablation therapies [393,398], but not suited for drug delivery applications. Moreover, as secondary biological effects are monitored, local cavitation activity in vivo, in relation to the ultrasound conditions, remains unchecked. As a way to overcome this, cavitation detection has been implemented in experimental setups to enhance the control and understanding of the conducted experiments [7,15,27,399].</p>
        <p>Cavitation detection originates from HIFU applications, where monitoring the in situ formation of gas bubbles and subsequent cavitation is key for defining the associated therapeutic effects as well as the safety. Cavitation detection can be separated in 2 categories: active cavitation detection and passive cavitation detection. Both categories rely on the use of 2 transducers: a HIFU transducer and a probing transducer that either passively records bubble activity or actively probes the bubble cloud by sending an imaging pulse. The use of a single element transducer as a probing transducer provides general information on the cloud density and behaviour, integrated over the focal volume of the transducer, and provides limited understanding on and control over the mechanical effects of the (micro)bubbles [400]. If the probing transducer is an array i.e. the combination of multiple single transducer elements, this enables microbubble localization in space, leading to acoustic mapping (AM). Active cavitation detection [401,402] which includes so-called (bubble) doppler mapping techniques [403,404] -probes the bubbles by sending a short imaging pulse after the therapeutic pulse. Therefore, while keeping a good resolution in the axial direction, active detection has the major drawback of probing the bubbles only indirectly, after the long therapeutic pulse. This limits the potential use of active detection techniques for direct treatment feedback and pressure adjustment since bubbles (clouds) submitted to therapeutic pressures (500 kPa or more) change in size, number, and response in time during a long ultrasound pulse. Therefore, analysing microbubble cavitation behaviour at a single and later time point after exposure to therapeutic ultrasound cannot be directly correlated to the cavitation of the initial microbubble population. Passive cavitation detection [398,405], on the other hand, monitors the bubble activity during the therapeutic pulse, by quantifying nonlinear bubble emissions, and in particular broadband emission that is directly related to the inertial behaviour of the bubble cloud. Choi, et al. have shown that passive acoustic mapping (PAM) is essential to define the exact bubble behaviour in order to predict the drug delivery outcome [400]. However, this real-time monitoring of the actual therapeutic activity is usually performed at the price of resolution since the use of a long ultrasound pulse directly impacts the imaging resolution with traditional reconstruction techniques. An important contribution to active mapping in the recent years consists in the use of some spectral methods for image reconstruction. Notable examples comprise time exposure acoustic (TEA), minimum variance beamforming [406], Capon beamforming and robust Capon beamforming [407] but it is beyond the scope of this review to further elaborate on the exact differences between these techniques. Still, the use of Robust Capon beamforming in both in vitro and preclinical studies has demonstrated a superior capability to create spatially resolved cavitation maps [407] and in this way effectively overcomes the main limitation of passive techniques: the loss of resolution. PAM has already demonstrated its usefulness for brain targeted therapy with complex neural structures [393,400,408]. Successful localization of bubble activity is very dependent on the choice of the algorithm, which is a major source of uncertainty and variability. Nonetheless, the latest results in passive mapping are promising. A combination of Robust Capon beamforming and doppler analysis is currently under development [409].Cavitation detection originates from HIFU applications, where monitoring the in situ formation of gas bubbles and subsequent cavitation is key for defining the associated therapeutic effects as well as the safety.

        <p>Without means for direct readout and adjustment of cavitation detection, past approaches have relied on a 'trial-and-error based' translation to elicit clinically relevant biological effects. The obtention of a spatially and temporally resolved cavitation map enables the implementation of feedback controllers to optimize the ultrasound parameters in real-time to ensure stable efficacy and safety [150,272,287,289,410]. In practice, the use of PAM with feedback control has been investigated to enhance the safety of breaking endothelial barriers in order to minimize unwanted vascular side-effects such as haemorrhages, blood clot formation and BBB disruption-associated neurotoxicity [272,393,400,410]. Before, permeabilization of the blood-brain-barrier after USMB was often documented by Evans blue dye, or accumulation of contrast agent on MRI. As these acoustic monitoring techniques are rather new, the concomitant use is not straightforward nor standard. Moreover, as the use of cavitation detection techniques has been primarily optimized for HIFU and FUS transducers, the applicability in microbubble-assisted drug delivery applications is yet to be assessed. The acoustic emissions (harmonics, subharmonics and broadband noise) that are used to determine the microbubble cavitation behaviour are strongly dependent on both, the frequency and intensity of the applied ultrasound and the type of microbubbles used [411]. Within the scope of the current transducer technology, passive acoustic mapping requires the use of 2 transducers. Indeed, emitting the therapeutic pulse and receiving the bubble signature simultaneously with the same transducer represents a first major challenge. Secondly, to enable the detection of acoustic emissions generated by acoustic cavitation to enable acoustic mapping, the high frequencies broadband bubble emissions (beyond the second harmonic) should be captured. The range of the frequencies of interest spans from ~1 MHz to ! 5 MHz, which exceeds by far the typical 70% bandwidth of imaging transducers and further justifies the use of 2 transducers. In general, there are many types of transducers available for clinical applications, ranging from high-power, single element transducers to high-frequency matrix array, and intravascular transducers. For HIFU-induced cavitation, the use of a single element transducer (e.g. a HIFU transducer) for generating the therapeutic pulse was a logical choice as it is more cost effective than a transducer array. For drug delivery applications with microbubbles on the contrary, much lower pressures than HIFU applications are required, and these pressures can be effortlessly generated with standard imaging transducers. In this context, a transducer array would provide dynamic focusing at variable focus depths and as such remove the need for mechanical scanning. Given the current challenges associated with cavitation mapping today, we expect that new developments in broadband transducers (i.e. CMUT technology) and dual frequency transducers will be instrumental for accelerating the translation of controlled, bubble-mediated drug-delivery to the clinic. Although still in their infancy, monitoring and control of microbubblemediated drug delivery will gain importance in the coming years and, hence, drastically enhance the understanding of the interplay between mechanical and biological effects thereby improving its efficacy and safety. Note that although cavitation mapping has greatly improved, the relation between cavitation activity and observed bioeffects [44,412,413] remains unclear, especially when factoring in the large variability of local tissue properties. This next step promises to be as complex as the ground work already achieved in spatiotemporal cavitation mapping. Here, we foresee that the rise of artificial intelligence will be instrumental in pushing this technological revolution even further [7], owing to its capability to handle complex, multiparametric and nonlinear problems.Without means for direct readout and adjustment of cavitation detection, past approaches have relied on a 'trial-and-error based' translation to elicit clinically relevant biological effects.

        <p>Finally, it is important to elaborate more onto the short and long term safety concerns associated with microbubble-assisted therapeutic applications. The short term safety effects are the direct effects associated with (repeated) injection(s) of microbubbles within a short time frame i.e. minutes to hours. Muskula, et al. summarized all the data of microbubble contrast agent usage in various patient populations and concluded that the use of microbubble contrast agents is extremely safe on a short term basis [414]. As there are currently no microbubblemediated drug delivery therapies approved by the EMA or FDA, these results are solely derived from patients who received the microbubbles for contrast imaging. Although the administration of microbubbles seems to be safe, the dynamics induced by therapeutic ultrasound can be quite violent. Therefore, the safety profile associated to therapeutic ultrasound treatments cannot be compared to the safety that was assessed when microbubbles are used for imaging purposes and should therefore be further clarified in future clinical trials as a procedure-specific variable. The first clinical trials investigating the safety of the therapeutic use of microbubbles and ultrasound are listed in the NIH clinical trial database (ClinicalTrials.gov). Currently, only one phase 3 clinical trial is reported where contrast enhanced diagnostic ultrasound is investigated combined with a neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for the treatment of early breast cancer. The current status is unknown (NCT03385200). Nonetheless, several microbubble-related clinical trials are active or planned in phase 1 or 2 to investigate microbubble-assisted blood-brain barrier opening for the treatment of glioblastoma (NCT04417088, NCT04528680 and NCT04440358) or Alzheimer's disease (NCT03119961). In addition, several clinical studies investigating the synergy of ultrasound induced microbubble cavitation and standardized cancer therapies like radiotherapy or chemotherapy are currently recruiting participants (NCT04431648, NCT04431674, NCT03458975, NCT03477019, NCT04146441).Finally, it is important to elaborate more onto the short and long term safety concerns associated with microbubble-assisted therapeutic applications.

        <p>The long term microbubble safety is associated with repeated injections of microbubbles over longer periods of time (weeks to months) and is mostly related to immune reactions against 'nonself' microbubble-components such as poly-ethylene glycol (PEG), non-covalent linkers used to attach the ligand to the microbubble shell, e.g. (strept-)avidin [180,415] or targeting ligands on the microbubble shell [187,242]. The addition of PEG onto both microbubble and nanomedicines results in a drastic increase in the circulation time. In nanomedicine-related research, the occurrence of anti-PEG antibodies after injection has been frequently investigated and results in accelerated blood clearance (ABC) of PEGylated nanomedicines after multiple injections [416][417][418]. Fix, et al. revealed similar findings for PEGylated microbubbles and observed that repeated injections give rise to anti-PEG antibodies and result in a 4-fold decrease in circulation time [116,419]. This decrease seriously hampers the subsequent use of microbubbles for therapy, considering the already limited circulation time in regular conditions in vivo. Moreover, the use of non-covalent linker molecules (strept-)avidin risk to stimulate (strept-)avidin specific immune reactions as these molecules have a respective bacterial or chicken egg origin and are, hence, 'nonself' to humans [180]. Although this linkage strategy is frequently used, there are hardly any reports on the safety implications of (strept-)avidin usage in humans, which should therefore be more thoroughly evaluated. In summary, immune reactions against microbubble-components could lead to enhanced clearance or in the worst case hypersensitivity reactions. To enable fast anticipation in the latter case, patients that were administered with microbubbles should be closely monitored by trained health care professionals [414].The long term microbubble safety is associated with repeated injections of microbubbles over longer periods of time (weeks to months) and is mostly related to immune reactions against 'nonself' microbubble-components such as poly-ethylene glycol (PEG), non-covalent linkers used to attach the ligand to the microbubble shell, e.g. (strept-)avidin [180,415] or targeting ligands on the microbubble shell [187,242].

        <p>Ultrasound-mediated techniques are very promising tools for overcoming biological barriers to facilitate drug delivery. In this review we have summarized how ultrasound induced microbubble cavitation can aid in overcoming cellular and tissue-specific biological barriers. In the past decade, the current knowledge about ultrasound mediated crossing of cell membranes and the subsequent impact on the cell homeostasis has been investigated in more detail. Today, further fundamental exploration remains indispensable to unravel ultrasound related cellular mechanisms. The many fundamental insights obtained until now have granted researchers a better understanding of cellular interplay in more complex biological tissues such as the blood-brain barrier and the tumor microenvironment. The latter has been studied more extensively in a preclinical setting which has led to some exciting clinical trials, either ongoing or currently in the pipeline. A more recent direction is the use of therapeutic ultrasound in cancer immunotherapy and although the first results are promising, more fundamental studies are required to estimate the full potential of ultrasound in this setting. Major advantages of ultrasound are its non-invasiveness and its spatial-selectivity for inducing biological effects and crossing biological barriers. This, in addition to its frequent application in the clinic, makes it a promising technique. However, some limitations still have to be tackled in order to fully unleash the potential of therapeutic ultrasound. Apart from the remaining fundamental questions about breaking biological barriers, the long-term safety linked to the treatment is not entirely resolved yet and should therefore be further investigated. Moreover, there is still a large gap to bridge considering the current lack of technical control over the interplay between microbubble cavitation, ultrasound parameters and the elicited biological effects. In summary, additional fundamental research and technical knowledge will be essential to allow the evolution of therapeutic ultrasound into a safe, sustainable, all-round and easy to adapt technique for a broad array of applications.Ultrasound-mediated techniques are very promising tools for overcoming biological barriers to facilitate drug delivery.
