        <p>During the past decades, polymer nanocomposites have attracted huge attention from both academia and industry, due to their excellent specific mechanical properties, thermal stability, electrical/thermal conductivity and chemical resistance properties, amongst others [1,2]. Thermosets and thermoplastics are two of the most important categories in the large family of polymeric materials that are commonly used as matrices in polymer composites. Compared to thermoplastics, thermosets are more favoured in advanced engineering applications, due to their high modulus and strength, alongside with their low viscosity and ease of manufacturing at room temperature. Amongst the list of thermosetting materials, epoxy resins possess superior characteristics and therefore consist probably the most widely used resins nowadays [3]. For example, epoxy resins exhibit high mechanical strength and hardness, due to their highly crosslinked rigid segments. Epoxy resins also develop low residual stress, due to relatively low levels of shrinkage during curing, while possessing good resistance to heat and chemicals [4]. Given that the demand for high performing lightweight structural materials has been continuously increasing, epoxy resins have been extensively used over the last decades especially in advanced fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) composites towards structural applications, i.e. in aerospace and automotive sectors, etc. [4].During the past decades, polymer nanocomposites have attracted huge attention from both academia and industry, due to their excellent specific mechanical properties, thermal stability, electrical/thermal conductivity and chemical resistance properties, amongst others [1,2].

        <p>Diverse microscale or nanoscale fillers have been incorporated into epoxy resins to further improve their mechanical properties and endow multifunctionality. Conventional fillers with microscale dimensions such as short glass/carbon fibres, carbon blacks, silica and metal micro particles have been widely used to reinforce epoxy resins. However, these traditional fillers display some unavoidable disadvantages [5]. For instance, high filler loadings are often required to achieve modest mechanical reinforcement, resulting in added weight penalty of the components. In addition, interfacial defects and weak interfacial interactions can result in catastrophic failure upon loading. To overcome these disadvantages, nanoscale fillers such as clay, silica (SiO2), carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene have been widely used as reinforcing agents in epoxy nanocomposites having a strong effect mainly in improving both static, dynamic and specifically the fracture toughness properties [6,7].Diverse microscale or nanoscale fillers have been incorporated into epoxy resins to further improve their mechanical properties and endow multifunctionality.

        <p>These nanofillers can be divided into three categories: zero-dimensional (0D) nanoparticles or nanospheres, one-dimensional (1D) nanotubes or nanowires, and two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets.These nanofillers can be divided into three categories: zero-dimensional (0D) nanoparticles or nanospheres, one-dimensional (1D) nanotubes or nanowires, and two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets.</p>
        <p>One-dimensional nanoparticles such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted lots of attention, due to their excellent thermal, electrical, mechanical properties, and unique structures with very high aspect ratios. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are essentially rolled-up monolayer graphene sheets that display a Young's modulus of 1 TPa and tensile strength in the order of 100 GPa, thermal conductivity of ~6000 W m -1 K -1 and high electrical conductivity in the range of 10 4 -10 8 S/m [8]. These characteristics render CNTs one of the most promising reinforcing fillers in epoxy nanocomposites, explaining the extensive research campaign conducted on CNT-reinforced polymer nanocomposites [9,10].One-dimensional nanoparticles such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted lots of attention, due to their excellent thermal, electrical, mechanical properties, and unique structures with very high aspect ratios.

        <p>It should be noted that the use of CNTs in nanocomposites also has some disadvantages compared to 2D nanofillers. For example, as it will be shown in detail later, 2D nanosheets with high surface to volume ratio are more favourable for reinforcement in polymers as random orientation of 2D materials reduces the composite modulus to almost half, while for 1D materials the composite modulus is reduced by a factor of 5 [11]. In addition, the 1D geometry of the CNTs makes them more prone to aggregation, while the entanglements between CNTs are very difficult to break resulting in a nonhomogeneous dispersion within the epoxy matrix. Moreover, the 1D geometry of CNTs often results in extremely high viscosity due to entanglement (even at low wt.%, &lt;1.0 wt.%), and this leads further in significant difficulties during processing i.e. mould filling and fibre infiltration during the manufacturing of composite materials via resin transfer moulding (RTM), resin infusion, or in a lower scale, during prepreg manufacturing. In contrast, polymer nanocomposites reinforced with 2D fillers are easier to process and achieve a better dispersion as a result of easier shear between the 2D nanosheets arising from weak interlayer forces. Additionally, the shape and the dimensions of 2D nanofillers are beneficial for constructing ordered structures that enable better stress transfer [12] and allow better barrier properties while maintaining multifunctionality. The entangled nanotubes on the other hand can act as stress concentration points during the application of strain and can even reduce the mechanical properties of a polymer matrix [13]. Consequently, 2D nanofillers, with their high aspect ratio, multifunctional properties and ease of processing hold huge potential in the reinforcement of epoxies and other polymeric matrices.It should be noted that the use of CNTs in nanocomposites also has some disadvantages compared to 2D nanofillers.

        <p>Amongst the 2D nanofillers, nanoclays (e.g. montmorillonite (MMT)) and graphene-related materials are two of the most widely used reinforcements for epoxy resins [6,14]. Ever since its isolation in 2004 [15], graphene has been regarded as one of the most promising reinforcing agents in polymer nanocomposites, due to its exceptional properties that include high modulus and strength along with excellent thermal and electrical properties [16]. Meanwhile, other 2D materials beyond graphene such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) and MXenes, such as Ti3C2Tx, also display excellent mechanical properties and a unique combination of characteristics.Amongst the 2D nanofillers, nanoclays (e.g. montmorillonite (MMT)) and graphene-related materials are two of the most widely used reinforcements for epoxy resins [6,14].

        <p>For example, hBN shows very high thermal conductivity, similar to that of graphene, while contrary to graphene it is an electrical insulator, making it suitable for heat sink applications. Additionally, MoS2 [17] is a chemically versatile 2D material, compared to the chemically-inert graphene, showing the largest piezoelectric activity among 2D materials [18]. In terms of mechanical properties, the elastic moduli of the three above-mentioned 2D materials are located between the values of nanoclay and graphene, at about 300-900 GPa [19]. From the above, it can be easily realised that a range of 2D nanofillers can be utilised for the efficient reinforcement of epoxies based on the targeted applications and properties. It is highly worthwhile then to gain an insight into fabrication and multifunctionality of epoxy nanocomposites reinforced with various 2D nanomaterials, as well as elucidate the structureproperty relationships towards maximisation of reinforcement in future technologies. This review summarizes recent advances in the preparation and the mechanical, tribological, thermal, electrical, flame retardant and anticorrosive properties of epoxy nanocomposites reinforced with 2D nanomaterials. Herein, we have focused on graphene-derived (e.g. graphene and graphene oxide (GO)) materials and on a number of other 2D materials (e.g. hBN, MoS2, Ti3C2Tx) for the reinforcement of epoxy resins.

        <p>Epoxy resins were first synthesized in 1909 by Prileschajew [3] and they can be considered as low molecular weight pre-polymers containing more than one epoxide group. The epoxide groups can react with curing agents (hardeners) over a wide temperature range to crosslink and form cured epoxy resins. The final crosslinking density and the properties of epoxy resins vary with the types of resin i.e. chemistry, molecular architecture of the epoxide monomer, as well as the employed curing agents and curing conditions.Epoxy resins were first synthesized in 1909 by Prileschajew [3] and they can be considered as low molecular weight pre-polymers containing more than one epoxide group.

        <p>Curing agents play a vital role in the final properties of epoxy resins. Epoxy resins react with a curing agent to form a crosslinked network through the polymerisation/curing process. Different curing agents such as amine-type, alkali, anhydrides and catalytic curing agents have been used [4]. The curing process can be conducted at room temperature or at elevated temperatures. Normally, epoxy resins obtained by high-temperature curing exhibit better properties such as higher glass transition temperature, as well as higher stiffness and strength [6].Curing agents play a vital role in the final properties of epoxy resins.

        <p>Graphene is composed of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a two-dimensional honeycomb structure as shown in Figure 1. Originating from its sp 2 hybridized bonds and π state bands, graphene exhibits unprecedented mechanical [21], thermal [22] and electrical [23] properties as summarized in Table 1. In addition, graphene also exhibits high intrinsic flexibility, large surface area and impermeability to gases and moisture [24]. Microscale structural superlubricity has also been achieved in bilayer graphene [25]. It should be noted that monolayer and two/three-layer graphene are not commonly used in polymer nanocomposites due to various difficulties associated with the bulk preparation of such nanomaterials and nanocomposites. The increase of graphene thickness results in significantly lower mechanical, thermal and electrical properties compared to the monolayer material, which are still adequate compared to other types of nanofillers. The geometrical characteristics, large aspect ratio and good processability are some of the unique attributes that make the family of graphenerelated materials highly effective in reinforcing polymer nanocomposites.Graphene is composed of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a two-dimensional honeycomb structure as shown in Figure 1.

        <p>Graphene derivatives are widely used as nanofillers in epoxy nanocomposites. Graphene oxide (GO) made by oxidation and exfoliation of graphite is one of the mostly used graphene derivatives in polymer nanocomposites. Compared with graphene, monolayer GO exhibits a lower elastic modulus due to the presence of lattice defects that originate from the oxidation process [26]. The defects also have a negative effect on the electrical and thermal conductivity of GO, thus hindering the application of GO in electrically and thermally conductive composites. However, the presence of oxygen functional groups such as epoxides, carboxylic acids and alcohols reveals that GO can interact chemically with certain polymers and especially with epoxy resins. This fact is certainly beneficial for improving the interfacial shear strength and stress transfer efficiency in GO-reinforced composites. It should be noted that the strong interactions between GO nanoplatelets and the polymer matrix can lead to a significant increase in viscosity. This in turn leads to processing difficulties, an inhomogeneous dispersion of the GO nanoflakes in the nanocomposites and subsequently a knock-down effect on the final properties. As a result, for the case of GO, a balance should be kept between the degree of oxidation, the optimal loading, the processability of the nanocomposite and its ultimate properties.Graphene derivatives are widely used as nanofillers in epoxy nanocomposites.

        <p>GO can be reduced (reduced graphene oxide, rGO) to graphene nanosheets. Compared with other preparation methods of graphene, the reduction of GO is low-cost, due to the use of graphite as raw material and suitable for large-scale production. The final properties of rGO depend on the degree of reduction. On the one hand, the removal of functional groups and defects can increase the intrinsic properties of GO. On the other hand, the removal of functional groups can decrease the interactions between the filler and the matrix. It has been shown that the removal of oxygen functional groups can induce nanosheet re-agglomeration and as a result, this process can reduce the aspect ratio, increase the thickness of the nanoplatelets and therefore reduce the mechanical reinforcing efficiency [27].GO can be reduced (reduced graphene oxide, rGO) to graphene nanosheets.

        <p>Boron nitride, also called "white graphene", is structurally similar to graphene, with boron and nitride atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice (Figure 1). The Young's modulus and tensile strength of monolayer hBN are shown in Table 1 [28]. Quite importantly, the increase of layer number (up to nine layers) does not degrade its mechanical properties due to strong interlayer interactions and suppressed sliding tendency under strain -that is in contrast with what happens for graphene [28].Boron nitride, also called "white graphene", is structurally similar to graphene, with boron and nitride atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice (Figure 1).

Another unique feature of BN is that it is electrically insulating. Therefore, BN can be used to create mechanically robust, thermally conductive and electrically insulating polymer nanocomposites. In addition, its electrical insulating nature makes BN more suitable as long-term barrier material compared to graphene, since conductive graphene may introduce galvanic corrosion phenomena [32].Hexagonal BN is resistant to oxidation.

        <p>Different from the structure of graphene and BN, in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) the transition metal atoms are sandwiched between two layers of chalcogen atoms as shown in Figure 1. Among the list of TMDCs, MoS2 has been used to reinforce a number of polymers [33]. Crystalline MoS2 is met in three structural polytypes; trigonal, hexagonal and rhombohedral. The most common polytype is the hexagonal one, and the bulk mineral molybdenite is used for the exfoliation of fewlayer MoS2. The Young's modulus and tensile strength of monolayer MoS2 were measured to be 270 ± 100 GPa and 22 ± 4 GPa, respectively [34], indicating that MoS2 can also be a quite effective mechanical reinforcing agent in polymer composites, however with lower reinforcing capabilities compared to BN and graphene due to the important differences in their intrinsic mechanical properties.Different from the structure of graphene and BN, in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) the transition metal atoms are sandwiched between two layers of chalcogen atoms as shown in Figure 1.

In terms of its electrical properties, hexagonal MoS2 is a semiconductor while trigonal MoS2 is metallic [33]. Finally, the use of MoS2 can also improve the flame retardant properties of polymer composites as a result of its barrier effect that retards the heat release rate and the catalytic effect that improves char yield and suppresses the production of smoke.In addition, superlubricity has also been observed in layered MoS2 [35], which implies that MoS2 can be used to enhance the tribological performance of polymer composites.

        <p>Despite its agility, the method also has some drawbacks. At large filler contents (&gt; 10-20 wt%), achieving a homogeneous dispersion can be quite challenging. Additionally, the complete removal of the solvent is essential as any residue can degrade the properties of the nanocomposite while the use of large quantities of solvents can cause environmental concerns associated with their disposal. Finally, re-aggregation or restacking of 2D nanoplatelets is quite common during the blending step of the epoxies with the fillers.Despite its agility, the method also has some drawbacks.

        <p>A common problem of mechanical mixing is that (similarly to solution blending) high filler contents (e.g. &gt; 10-20 wt%) are not easily well-dispersed, resulting in aggregation phenomena. To improve the dispersion and alignment of 2D nanofillers in an epoxy matrix, a method that utilises compression moulding has been proposed in the literature, (schematically depicted in Figure 2) [50][51][52]. The method allows the creation of oriented filler networks and the closure of gaps between adjacent fillers, creating highly conductive pathways. This is another typical example of the importance of filler orientation towards the maximization of the ultimate properties of nanocomposites across a certain direction. In general, the reduction in the lateral dimensions of 2D fillers during mixing should be avoided or minimised, to preserve their high aspect ratio that is crucial for the resulting mechanical, electrical, thermal and functional properties endowed to the final nanocomposites. When the filler loading is high, a drastic increase in the resin viscosity is usually observed. In this case, the mechanical mixing methods might introduce excessive shear forces that reduce the filler lateral dimensions. The viscosity increase is also commonly accelerated by 2D fillers which already have functional groups on their surface (such as GO and MXenes) or by chemically functionalised fillers. It is worth noting that the subsequent processing steps are also highly important in determining final properties, as the dispersed nanofillers tend to re-agglomerate, due to their large surface area until the curing process is completed [53].A common problem of mechanical mixing is that (similarly to solution blending) high filler contents (e.g. &gt; 10-20 wt%) are not easily well-dispersed, resulting in aggregation phenomena.

        <p>Compared to traditional materials such as steel, aluminium and titanium, a huge advantage of epoxy-based matrix composites is the combination of high strength and low weight. Therefore, they have been widely applied in the automotive industry as frame parts, chassis parts, floor panels, firewalls, seat structure, closure of trucks, and so on.

        <p>However, the final mechanical performance of polymer composites does not depend only on the aspect ratio, orientation, volume fraction, and effective modulus of the fillers, but also on other factors that are not represented in the modified rule of mixtures. Indeed, equation ( 1) is valid for composites containing perfectly dispersed fillers, but this is not always the case, especially for nanocomposites where nanofillers can agglomerate at low volume fractions (&lt;2 vol%), due to their high aspect ratio and inter-particle attraction. Agglomerated nanoparticles are not in full contact with the polymer matrix, thus the external load cannot be efficiently transferred from the matrix as expected by Cox's shear-lag theory [59], and the nominal volume fraction of the nanofiller can only partially contribute to the mechanical reinforcement. A few micromechanical theories have been proposed in the literature in an attempt to account for agglomeration phenomena in polymer nanocomposites. Santagiuliana et al. [60] proposed that the reduced volume fraction (or effective volume fraction, Vf(eff)) effectively reinforcing a nanocomposite, that unavoidably contains agglomerates, can be calculated using a nanofiller dispersion level, D, from the following simple equation; 𝑉 %($%%) = 𝐷 • 𝑉 % (with 0 ≤ D ≤ 1), and experimentally found that D is proportional to the ratio between the nanofiller-matrix contact area and the total nanofiller surface area. Since there is a maximum limit to the nanofiller-matrix contact area that is given by the maximum specific surface area that a polymer can reach [61], D will always decrease after a critical nanofiller concentration (the onset of agglomeration), which explains the decreasing reinforcing efficiency commonly observed in nanocomposites with the increased amount of nanofiller. Similarly, Li et al. [62] proposed the introduction of an agglomeration factor (ηa) within the modified rule of mixtures (Eq. 1) that takes values between 0 and 1, where for ηa = 0 all flakes are aggregated and nearly no stress transfer takes place, while for ηa = 0 all flakes are well dispersed and interact strongly with the matrix to allow good stress transfer.However, the final mechanical performance of polymer composites does not depend only on the aspect ratio, orientation, volume fraction, and effective modulus of the fillers, but also on other factors that are not represented in the modified rule of mixtures.

        <p>Besides micromechanics, first principle calculations and molecular dynamics can be employed to evaluate the reinforcing mechanisms of polymers by 2D materials. Odegard's group has recently reported on the molecular-level structure of the interface between resins or hardeners, reinforced with graphene and boron nitride monolayers, by density functional theory [63]. The first principles calculations revealed that the interfacial adhesion was dependent upon the orientation of the resin on graphene, as a result of the van der Waals interactions. Additionally, a small degree of polarity at the interface can help in improving the mechanical properties of the nanocomposite. The same group performed molecular dynamic simulations on epoxy reinforced with GNPs, GO and functionalised GO (fGO) [64]. The results showed that the wrinkles on the GO materials improve the filler-matrix interlocking mechanism, leading to an increase in the out-of-plane shar modulus, while as expected, the mechanical properties of GO and fGO are lower than that of the GNPs as a result of the transformation of the sp2 structure to sp3 structure.Besides micromechanics, first principle calculations and molecular dynamics can be employed to evaluate the reinforcing mechanisms of polymers by 2D materials.

        <p>A large number of research works have focused on the mechanical properties of graphene-based epoxy nanocomposites [65][66][67][68][69][70][71][72][73][74][75][76][77][78][79]. High levels of reinforcement have been achieved by Cha et al. through non-covalent functionalization [67] of graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) by melamine. The addition of 2 wt% functionalized GNPs led to an increase of the Young's modulus, tensile strength and fracture toughness of the nanocomposites. The reinforcing efficiency of GNPs was higher than their CNTs counterparts, compared to either pristine or functionalized CNTs. This lies in the fact that 2D GNPs are able to create a larger polymer/filler interface compared to 1D CNTs, which leads to an improved stress transfer efficiency, and also prevents the nanofiller pull out or debonding under strain. The functionalization process ultimately led to an improved dispersion of the samples by preventing agglomeration and restacking of the fillers and promoting interactions between the nanofillers and the epoxy. It should be mentioned at this point that a number of works have reported a decrease of the tensile strength of the epoxy matrix as a result of the introduction of graphene-related materials, even at very low filler contents (~0.01 vol%) [68,69]. Tensile strength is highly sensitive to the presence of defects, which concentrate stress and act as failure points during the application of strain. Therefore, the introduction of 2D fillers which contain a high density of defects within a relatively high-strength polymer (such as epoxy resins) will not effectively increase the tensile strength. Additionally, strong interfacial adhesion needs to be ensured in order to form bonds between the matrix and the filler, allowing efficient stress transfer hence to achieve high tensile strength; for this purpose, 2D materials with functional groups on their surface are more suitable for maximisation of reinforcement.A large number of research works have focused on the mechanical properties of graphene-based epoxy nanocomposites [65][66][67][68][69][70][71][72][73][74][75][76][77][78][79].

Additionally, strong interfacial adhesion needs to be ensured in order to form bonds between the matrix and the filler, allowing efficient stress transfer hence to achieve high tensile strength; for this purpose, 2D materials with functional groups on their surface are more suitable for maximisation of reinforcement.</p>
        <p>Two-dimensional BN nanosheets (BNNSs) have also been used to mechanically reinforce epoxy nanocomposites [80][81][82][83][84][85][86]. As mentioned earlier, even though the elastic modulus of hBN is slightly lower compared to graphene, the increase in layer number (up to nine layers) is not expected to degrade significantly its intrinsic mechanical properties [28]. Lin et al. [81] prepared epoxy/hBN (20 wt.%) nanocomposites using solution blending and used magnetic field to align the hBN nanoplatelets in the epoxy matrix. As expected, vertical alignment (in the z direction) improved the elastic modulus of the composites significantly. In another study, non-covalent functionalization via 1-pyrenebutyric acid (PBA) was used to toughen BNNS/epoxy nanocomposites [82]. The fracture toughness of the neat epoxy was doubled with only 0.3 wt% PBA-BNNSs. The reinforcing mechanism is similar with the case of GNPs described earlier, where the non-covalent functionalization prevented BNNSs from aggregation and increased the contact area between BNNSs and the epoxy matrix.Two-dimensional BN nanosheets (BNNSs) have also been used to mechanically reinforce epoxy nanocomposites [80][81][82][83][84][85][86].

        <p>Friction is universal and inevitable in our life, and it often causes the waste of energy and resources; therefore, it is important to monitor and control friction and wear. Benefiting from their low cost, easy processing and low friction, epoxy resins have been used in components that are commonly subjected to wear. For example, epoxy resins have been widely applied in the construction industry for coating on floors, counters, bar-tops and much more. The use of epoxy resins can generate a smooth, glossy and hard-wearing surface. However, the load carrying capacity and thermal properties of epoxies are considerably lower than metals and ceramics.

[106] studied the effects of GO, CNT and MoS2 (at 1.2 wt%) on the tribological performance of epoxy nanocomposites under dry sliding. The increase in sliding velocity or applied load increases the friction coefficient and wear rate, as high speeds or loads increase temperature during friction and this results in decreased adhesion and increased wear. The addition of CNTs, GO, MoS2 or their hybrids reduced the friction coefficient and wear rate of the epoxy nanocomposites effectively (Figure 4a and4b). Compared to CNTs and GO, the sample filled with neat MoS2 displayed a higher reduction in friction due to its excellent selflubricating properties. The epoxy nanocomposites with the hybrid filler (a combination of all three fillers) exhibited the best friction performance and the coefficient of friction of the epoxy was decreased by more than 90% (Figure 4a). Similarly, the wear rate of the pure epoxy was reduced by more than 95% with the hybrid CNTs, GO and MoS2 filler, as shown in Figure 4b. The tribology mechanisms are explained schematically in Figure 4c and4d. The neat epoxy is not resistant to wear and can be easily worn off with the formation of spalling pits and large debris. For epoxy nanocomposites, GO and CNTs with their high mechanical strength, act as load bearers at surface valleys to prevent the matrix from being further worn and MoS2 acts as a self-lubricating layer to reduce the friction coefficient.

        <p>Overall, graphene and MoS2 are both excellent lubricating additives in epoxy nanocomposites, and they can function additively to further improve the tribological performance of epoxy nanocomposites. Apart from graphene and MoS2, the effects of other 2D materials such as hBN [111][112][113][114] and MXenes [115][116][117][118] on the tribological performance of epoxy nanocomposites have also been investigated. Yu el al. [112] studied the effects of functionalized cubic boron nitride (FC-BN) and functionalized hexagonal boron nitride (FH-BN) on the tribological performance of epoxy nanocomposites. On the one hand, the BN nanosheets exhibit poorer self-lubricating properties compared to graphene and MoS2 due to stronger interlayer interactions; thus, the friction coefficient of the epoxy matrix decreased only slightly with the addition of BN. On the other hand, the high strength of BN nanosheets increased the hardness of the composites and prevented the propagation of cracks; therefore, the wear rate of the epoxy matrix was sharply reduced with the addition of 0.5 wt% FH-BN. Recently, Meng et al. [115] studied the tribological performance of epoxy nanocomposites reinforced with Ti3C2 MXene. The coefficient of friction of the pure epoxy decreased by 76.3% with the introduction of 1 wt% Ti3C2, and the wear rate decreased by 67.4% with 3 wt% Ti3C2. The distribution of Ti3C2 in the epoxy was homogeneous due to the well-ordered 3D structure. During the friction process, the cracks propagate into the aligned nanosheets and form flake debris. Some of the debris can slide to reduce the friction coefficient and wear rate. Furthermore, few-layer Ti3C2 can shear under force, which can lead to efficient friction reduction. The hardness of Ti3C2 is responsible for the reduction in wear rate.Overall, graphene and MoS2 are both excellent lubricating additives in epoxy nanocomposites, and they can function additively to further improve the tribological performance of epoxy nanocomposites.

        <p>The electrical insulating nature of epoxies has been utilised for potting and encapsulation in the electronics and electrical industries. However, electrically conductive resins and adhesives are necessary in some applications. Conductive resins and adhesives can be used as spraying or electrostatic painting on fuel lines, sensitive, high-temperature electronics and external components on vehicle or wind turbines to prevent sparks. An important application of electrically conductive epoxy nanocomposites is electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding. High electrical conductivity is required for EMI shielding, due to the interactions between charge carriers and EM fields [147]. The incorporation of electrically conductive 2D materials can transform an epoxy from insulating to conductive upon the establishment of a percolated network [148]. According to the percolation theory, the electrical conductivity of composites can be described from the following relationship: 𝜎 = 𝜎 7 (𝑉 % -𝑉 ! ) 8 where σ is the electrical conductivity of the composite, σ0 is a preexponential factor, dependent on the electrical conductivity of the filler, Vc is the percolation threshold in volume fraction, and t is the conductivity exponent. The value of t is around 1.1-1.3 for 2D systems and 1.6-2.0 for 3D systems [148]. Therefore, the electrical conductivity of nanocomposites does not follow a linear relationship with the filler loading, as shown in Figure 7a. At low loadings, the polymer is insulating or displays low electrical conductivity. As the filler loading reaches the percolation threshold, a dramatic increase in conductivity can be observed due to the formation of a conductive network for electronic charge carriers (electrons or holes). The conductivity then reaches a plateau with less obvious increment in conductivity upon further increase in filler loading. Similar to thermal conductivity, it is of great importance to construct aligned 2D or 3D interconnected networks to impart electrical conductivity effectively. Additionally, fillers with large lateral dimensions, especially with larger aspect ratios, are favoured for the formation of percolating networks as they can reduce the percolation threshold. Considering its high electrical conductivity and large aspect ratio, graphene can impart a relatively low percolation threshold and can improve the electrical conductivity, as well as the EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) of epoxy resins effectively [150][151][152][153][154][155][156]. Recently, epoxy nanocomposites with high electrical conductivity and high EMI SE reinforced by both GNPs and rGO were manufactured through the construction of 3D conductive networks [150]. The variations of electrical conductivity and EMI SE of the composites as a function of the filler loading are shown in Figure 7b and 7d. The electrical conductivity of rGO/epoxy nanocomposites is low, due to the presence of defects in the rGO structure; however, this value increased with the addition of 7.9 wt% GNPs due to the intrinsic electrical conductivity of GNPs. The effectiveness of the 3D hybrid filler network on electrical conductivity and EMI SE can be observed in Figure 7d, where the total EMI SE (SET) of epoxy nanocomposites prepared by freeze-drying (solid symbols) is much higher compared to their counterparts prepared by solution blending (open symbols). The epoxy nanocomposites with 0.1 wt% rGO and 20.4 wt% GNPs exhibit the highest EMI SE in the X-band range as a result of the conductive networks, which act as dissipating mobile charge carriers and interact with the incident electromagnetic waves. Moreover, the incoming electromagnetic waves are multiply absorbed, reflected and scattered by the 3D structure. Overall, not only the intrinsic properties of 2D fillers, but also the formation of 3D interconnected networks contribute to the enhancement of electrical conductivity and the EMI SE of epoxy nanocomposites.The electrical insulating nature of epoxies has been utilised for potting and encapsulation in the electronics and electrical industries.

        <p>Kernin et al. demonstrated that rGO/epoxy nanocomposites with 0.5 wt.% filler loading show excellent cyclic sensing performance, with a gauge factor (GF) over 40 (Figure 9a) [53]. The change of distances and contacts between conductive fillers within the network during deformation can induce a measurable electrical sensing signal (Figure 9b). By correlating the sensing signals to strain, the deformation or damage of nanocomposite can be monitored in real time.

        <p>As mentioned before and after, epoxy resins have been extensively used as laminates and structural matrix materials, surface coatings, structural adhesives and electronic materials. However, untreated epoxy resins typically exhibit high flammability and high smoke production during combustion, which restricts applications requiring good flame resistance. As a result, the introduction of epoxies in a number of advanced applications is highly associated with the fabrication of materials that display reduced flammability. In flame retardant materials it is difficult to quantify the contributions from various elements of a system towards one dominant mechanism; however, the effective mechanism of flame retardancy can be divided into two actions: the gas-phase and the condensed-phase actions, as illustrated in Figure 10 [161]. A number of different areas are involved in the flame retardancy mechanism when flame is directed to a polymer: the flame zone, the char layer, the thermal decomposition (or molten polymer) and underlying polymer zones. The char layer is critical as it controls heat and mass transfer between condensed and gas phases, while volatiles are generated in the thermal decomposition zone and then mitigate towards the flame zone. The condensed phase mechanism involves the formation of char layer on the surface which controls the heat and mass transfer between the gas phase and the condensed phase by blocking flammable volatiles from diffusion and shielding the polymer from air and heat. The gas phase mechanism includes the interruption of combustion process by radical absorption, as halogen-containing compounds can form less reactive halogen atoms by the reaction between specific radicals and highly reactive species.As mentioned before and after, epoxy resins have been extensively used as laminates and structural matrix materials, surface coatings, structural adhesives and electronic materials.

        <p>On the other hand, GO is highly flammable due to the effects of potassium salts (eg. KMnO4 and K2S2O8) that are used during its synthesis, which must be removed from GO in order to be considered for flame retardant applications [164]. Different methods such as the incorporation of flame retardant elements [165], polymer grafting [166] and the combination with other fillers [167,168] have been adopted to improve the flame retardancy of epoxy nanocomposites with graphene and graphene derivatives. Feng et al. [165] studied the effects of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) doping on the flame retardant performance of rGO/epoxy nanocomposites. The incorporation of PN-rGO increased char yield and reduced the mass loss rate of the composites due to the formation of a protective char layer. It was found that p-and n-doping increased the thermal-oxidative stability of rGO and promoted the dispersion of rGO in the epoxy matrix. Meanwhile, the doped groups catalysed the carbonization of epoxy chains and improved the char yield. The combination of catalysed carbonization and the high thermal stability of the rGO network promoted the formation of a strong char layer, which can reduce the oxidation of residual chars and restrict the formation of holes and cracks. Therefore, the peak heat release rate (PHRR) and total heat release (THR) of the composites were reduced by 31% and 29% with the addition of 5 wt% PN-rGO. It should be noted here that the heat release rate (HRR) is calculated by measuring the gas flow and oxygen concentration during combustion, while the THR is calculated by the integration of HRR versus time. In addition, the limiting oxygen index (LOI, the least oxygen concentration for the combustion of the polymer) was improved from 25 to 30%. The effects of the high thermal conductivity of graphene towards the flame retardancy properties are quite complex; a high thermal conductivity can increase the conduction of heat from the surface to the interior and thereby delay ignition while at the same time increase the peak heat release rate. Therefore, a balance between the effects of thermal conductivity and the shielding performance of the nanofillers should be pursued by adjusting the filler content, in order to minimise the heat release rate and maximise the time to ignition. An example of decreased PHRR of epoxy nanocomposites reinforced with GNPs has been reported as a result of the competition between the high thermal conductivity and the barrier effect of GNPs [169].On the other hand, GO is highly flammable due to the effects of potassium salts (eg.

It has been shown that the oxidation temperature of BN nanosheets (700-850 ℃) is much higher compared to that of graphene (450-500 ℃) [30], which means that BN nanosheets can outperform graphene in the enhancement of thermal stability. Yu et al. [170] studied the effects of hydroxylated h-BN (BNO) on the thermal stability and flame retardancy of epoxy nanocomposites. The glass transition temperature of the epoxy was increased from 130.3 to 173 ℃ with the addition of 3 wt% BNO, as the covalently functionalized BNO nanosheets increased the crosslinking density and confined the movement of the molecular chains of the epoxy resin. In addition, the PHRR and THR of epoxy nanocomposites were decreased by 53% and 33% with the incorporation of 3 wt% BNO, which was attributed to the formation of a thermally stable char layer from BNO nanosheets.

For example, the PHRR and THR of epoxy resin were reduced by 66% and 34% with the incorporation of 2 wt% of a hybrid layered double hydroxide/MoS2 filler [177]. Another effective flame retardant additive is BP. Different from the additives which rely on the reinforcement in the condensed phase, the use of BP can affect both the gas phase and the condensed phase of flame retardancy simultaneously [97,98,[180][181][182]. Therefore, BP can be considered a highly effective flame retardant in polymer nanocomposites. One drawback of BP lies in its instability under air, which has restricted its applications in polymer composites. Various modification methods have been proposed which can not only improve the air stability of BP nanosheets but also promote the dispersion of BP nanosheets in polymer matrices. Qu et al.

        <p>The excellent resistance to chemicals, strong adhesion to substrates and high mechanical strength of epoxy resins render them suitable for anti-corrosion coatings ranging from heavy industry to daily life. An epoxy coating can be placed on the targeted metal to protect the metal from corrosion. For example, epoxy coatings have long been used to protect ships and marine structures. Metal cans and containers are often coated with epoxy resins to prevent rusting. Besides, epoxy resins have also been coated on paintings, sculptures, statues, souvenirs and laminate table tops. The use of epoxy coatings can provide a physical barrier effect and inhibit the penetration of corrosive media into metal surfaces.The excellent resistance to chemicals, strong adhesion to substrates and high mechanical strength of epoxy resins render them suitable for anti-corrosion coatings ranging from heavy industry to daily life.

        <p>However, due to the effects of the corrosive environment (e.g. temperature, chemicals, solvents), pure epoxy coatings tend to deteriorate quickly after being exposed to corrosive media for a short time, given that they act as mixed-type corrosion inhibitors [189]. The anticorrosion mechanism of polymer coatings is shown in Figure 12a. The corrosion process can be divided into three steps: water absorption on the coating surface, diffusion of corrosive media in the coating matrix and final corrosion on the metal surface [190]. When fillers are well-dispersed in the matrix, the diffusion path of corrosive media is more tortuous and the barrier performance is improved. Various fillers have been incorporated into polymer coatings to improve their corrosion resistance and to prolong their service life [191].However, due to the effects of the corrosive environment (e.g. temperature, chemicals, solvents), pure epoxy coatings tend to deteriorate quickly after being exposed to corrosive media for a short time, given that they act as mixed-type corrosion inhibitors [189]. The anticorrosion mechanism of polymer coatings is shown in Figure 12a. The corrosion process can be divided into three steps: water absorption on the coating surface, diffusion of corrosive media in the coating matrix and final corrosion on the metal surface [190]. When fillers are well-dispersed in the matrix, the diffusion path of corrosive media is more tortuous and the barrier performance is improved. Various fillers have been incorporated into polymer coatings to improve their corrosion resistance and to prolong their service life [191].</p>
        <p>Among these fillers, 2D nanosheets with their geometrical characteristics, large surface area and high gas/liquid barrier efficiency can outperform other fillers (e.g. with spherical and tubular shapes) in the improvement of anticorrosive performance as they can better distort the diffusion path of corrosive media and block corrosive media (e.g. water vapour) from entering the anticorrosion coating [192].Among these fillers, 2D nanosheets with their geometrical characteristics, large surface area and high gas/liquid barrier efficiency can outperform other fillers (e.g. with spherical and tubular shapes) in the improvement of anticorrosive performance as they can better distort the diffusion path of corrosive media and block corrosive media (e.g. water vapour) from entering the anticorrosion coating [192].</p>
        <p>On that basis, a well-oriented network of fillers within a composite is able to outperform randomly dispersed systems. The incorporation of 2D nanosheets can also increase the hydrophobicity of the coating surface and increase the adhesion strength between the coating and the metal surface, which also lead to improved anticorrosion characteristics.

        <p>Graphene has been widely used as an ultra-thin and lightweight anticorrosive additive in epoxy resins due to its large surface area and high impermeability [194][195][196][197][198]. Chen et al. [194] studied the effects of non-covalently functionalized graphene nanosheets on the corrosion behaviour of epoxy coatings. It was found that the P2BA-stabilized graphene improved the corrosion performance of epoxy nanocomposites as it reduced the water absorption of the epoxy after immersion in water for 10 days. The tortuous path created by well-dispersed GNPs prevents water from permeating through the epoxy. Additionally, the initial coating resistance was similar for the pure epoxy and epoxy nanocomposites (in the order of 10 9 Ω cm 2 ). However, the coating resistance of pure epoxy decreased sharply after 80 days, while the corresponding value of epoxy nanocomposites was stable at 10 8 Ω cm 2 . The presence of functionalized graphene inhibited the penetration of electrolyte and improved the corrosive resistance of epoxy coatings. These results indicate that the use of graphene can improve the anticorrosive performance of epoxy coatings effectively. It should be pointed out that the high electrical conductivity of graphene restricts its application in long-term corrosion coatings (e.g. more than 80 days), as it can promote electrochemical reactions and galvanic corrosion [32]. The electrically insulating BN or semiconducting hexagonal MoS2 can be effective alternatives to graphene for longterm anticorrosion applications.Graphene has been widely used as an ultra-thin and lightweight anticorrosive additive in epoxy resins due to its large surface area and high impermeability [194][195][196][197][198].

        <p>Boron nitride nanosheets have also been investigated as barrier materials considering their chemical stability and high impermeability [199][200][201][202]. Additionally, boron nitride has an advantage towards enhancement of barrier performance compared to graphene, as its electrical resistivity can inhibit the galvanic corrosion under ambient environment. It has been shown that pure BN can outperform graphene in terms of long-term corrosion barrier due to its high impermeability and electrical insulating characteristics [32]. Therefore, it is expected that BN can enhance the anticorrosive performance of epoxy nanocomposites enduringly. Cui et al. [200] investigated the effect of BN on the anticorrosive performance of an epoxy coating. Poly(2-butylaniline) (PBA) was used once again to facilitate the exfoliation and dispersion of BN nanosheets and the corrosion behaviour of epoxy coatings was characterised. For the pure epoxy, the impedance modulus degraded dramatically, more than 3 orders of magnitude, after 50 days immersion. In contrast, the impedance modulus of the epoxy nanocomposites with 0.5 wt% BN remained stable after 120 days immersion.Boron nitride nanosheets have also been investigated as barrier materials considering their chemical stability and high impermeability [199][200][201][202].

        <p>The addition of BN nanosheets inhibited the penetration of corrosive media by introducing a complex diffusion path for the corrosive media. In addition, the use of PBA passivates the metal surface and a protective layer is formed on the metal surface to block corrosive media, which ensures superior anticorrosive performance. In another study, it was found that functionalized Al2O3 can not only improve the stability and dispersion of BN but also promote the interfacial adhesion between BN nanosheets and epoxy matrix by acting as a spacer between the BN nanosheets [201]. Therefore, the diffusion path becomes even more complex and the anticorrosive performance of epoxy nanocomposites are significantly improved.The addition of BN nanosheets inhibited the penetration of corrosive media by introducing a complex diffusion path for the corrosive media.

        <p>Ding et al. [193] compared the corrosion performance of epoxy nanocomposites reinforced by MoS2, WS2 and graphene as shown in Figure 12. The addition of MoS2 and WS2 reduced the oxygen and water vapour transmission rate due to the formation of a tortuous diffusion path for gas molecules.Ding et al.

        <p>Additionally, it was found that MoS2 and WS2 provide better corrosion resistance in epoxy resins compared to graphene. For example, epoxy nanocomposites with 1 wt% MoS2 and WS2 displayed significantly better coating resistance than the epoxy samples reinforced with 1 wt% graphene. The reason for this, as mentioned earlier, is the high conductivity of graphene that allows electron transfer and formation of a conductive network between the coating and substrate, which can promote the galvanic corrosion of the coating. In contrast, the semiconducting MoS2 or WS2 can inhibit this process and improve the corrosion performance. Another disadvantage of graphene in such applications is its oxygen reduction catalytic activity, which can also promote the corrosion process. Overall, TMDCs can be considered more effective in the inhibition of corrosion compared to graphene.Additionally, it was found that MoS2 and WS2 provide better corrosion resistance in epoxy resins compared to graphene.

        <p>However, the low thermal conductivity, the insulating nature and the low mechanical strength of epoxy resins have largely restricted their application as shape memory materials. Various 2D materials can be incorporated into an epoxy matrix to increase its thermal or electrical response, and therefore shape memory performance. As shown by the majority of literature reports, the shape memory performance is commonly obtained at low filler contents (&lt; 2 wt%), indicating the scalability and the costeffectiveness of the nanocomposite materials. For example, the mechanical properties and shape memory effects of graphene nanoplatelets in an epoxy were studied by Zhao et al. [213,214]￼ and results showed that the presence of GNPs (at 1 wt%) induced enhanced recovery stress and speed compared to neat epoxy. Similarly, Yu et al. [215] revealed that only 0.8 wt% of GO can lead to good shape recovery ratio, shape restoring rate and thermomechanical performance. In the interesting work of D'Elia et al. [216]￼ Joule heating was utilised to induce a shape memory effect (shape fixity above 0.95 and shape recovery ratio above 0.98) for rGO/epoxy nanocomposites at low voltages and low filler contents (&lt;1 wt%). The multifunctionality of the material allows damage sensing, while the filler network is able to divert crack propagation and increase fracture resistance. In another work, a hybrid GO/CNT filler was utilised to enhance filler dispersion and composite mechanical properties and conductivity, which led to a significant increase of the thermal response speed of epoxy nanocomposites [211]. The thermal response speed was significantly affected by the thermal conductivity at lower filler contents (&lt; 2 wt%), while for higher filler loadings the storage modulus was the dominating factor, restricting the response of shape memory effect. The aqueous suspension route for the eco-friendly fabrication of the nanocomposites, along with the excellent shape memory performance makes the specific materials interesting for use in many areas such as textiles, sensors, aerospace/automotive industries and others. Finally, nacre-like shape memory rGO/epoxy composites have been shown to also display interesting shape memory properties [224]. The nacre-like composites displayed a shape memory effect with thermal and electrical stimuli, while the fracture toughness of the matrix was improved significantly (∼2.5 times) at only 0.6 wt% of rGO content. The mechanism of shape memory for such composites (Figure 13a), involves the increase of temperature above the Tg, where the composites become soft (Figure 13a1-2) and the subsequent application of stress, which changes chain conformations and results in a new, fixed shape (Figure 13a3). The reduction of temperature leads to chain freezing and storage of entropic energy (Figure 13a4); however, with the increase of temperature as a result of heat or electrical current (Figure 13a5), the molecular chains are driven back to their lowest energy configuration (initial shape). Even though the literature on SMP/2D material nanocomposites is dominated by graphene-related materials, also MXenes could be used in a similar manner for the creation of electrically and thermally conductive SMP composites, while boron nitride and its hybrids [225][226][227][228][229] could also offer an alternative. Overall, it can be concluded that the introduction of 2D fillers into shape memory epoxy resins at low filler contents can effectively lead to strong self-shaping structures and can avoid catastrophic failure. The architecture of the nanocomposites needs to be fully controlled to take advantage of the 2D geometry of the fillers and their exceptional intrinsic properties for the creation of structural and multifunctional shape memory nanocomposites for various high-end applications. 5) upon heating or re-exposure to current, the material recovers its permanent shape.

        <p>A number of challenges and opportunities still exist for the mass production of epoxy nanocomposites with 2D materials, even though several attempts are under industrial and commercial investigation. Initially, the scale up of the production of affordable and high-quality 2D nanofillers should be the main target of manufacturers, as this is always going to be reflected on the ultimate properties of the nanocomposites. Nanoplatelets with large lateral dimensions, low thickness and low defect density should be the ideal platform to maximise reinforcement. The scale up of the fabrication of 2D and 3D structures of 2D materials and the subsequent successful impregnation of an epoxy can also offer many possibilities for achieving high-performing epoxy nanocomposites. The significant increase in the viscosity of epoxies can pose a problem for 2D nanomaterials that include functional groups such as graphene oxide, where the strong bonding between the matrix and the filler leads to a saturation of the mechanical properties at relatively low filler contents; additional research towards this direction is needed. For the case of BP nanocomposites, its stability under air is still a major problem and new routes can be explored for the facile preparation of BP-epoxy nanocomposites. Novel functionalisation routes should be also explored for the maximisation of reinforcing efficiency of 2D materials. Given that the formation of a strong polymer/filler interface is the key to realising the properties of 2D materials into composites, further research on the topic can provide the community with a better understanding on how interfacial interactions are affecting each property.
