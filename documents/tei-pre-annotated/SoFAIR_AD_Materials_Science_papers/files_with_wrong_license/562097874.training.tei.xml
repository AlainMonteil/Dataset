        <p>A mong soft supramolecular materials, liquid-crystal (LC) systems hold a prominent position that is reflected by their widespread use in imaging and display technology. Tailoring the ordered molecular arrangement and self-organized behaviour of the soft superstructures of mesogenic materials and precisely controlling their dynamic behaviour along multiple length scales via remote light stimulation are major fundamental challenges and continue to offer opportunities for materials engineering [1][2][3] . As a distinctive feature of functional and stimuli-responsive LC-based soft materials, they can adopt self-organized helical superstructures due to the presence of a chiral dopant, thereby exhibiting the selective reflection (that is, a photonic band gap (PBG)) of circularly polarized light (CPL) with the same handedness sense as the LC helix. The central wavelength (λ c ) of the PBG is proportional to the helical pitch length (P) when the average refractive index (n) of the helical system is invariable, according to Bragg's law (λ c = nP) 4,5 . Since P is inversely proportional to the helical twisting power (HTP) of the chiral dopant, chiral photoswitches are intentionally introduced into achiral LCs to facilitate the control and modulation of the helical superstructure non-invasively by light [6][7][8] . This allows the reversible tuning of the Bragg reflection and as a consequence the image formation. Previous approaches for dynamically controlling the chirality and supramolecular organization in LC systems have mostly been based on the combination of photoswitches and chiral dopants 9 , photoswitches with chiral pending groups 10 (Fig. 1a) or overcrowded alkene switches 11 and rotary molecular motors [12][13][14][15][16] . Given the thermal instability of traditional photoswitches, in particular, azobenzenes [17][18][19][20][21] and fulgide derivative 22 , diarylethenes with excellent fatigue resistance over multiple switching cycles 23 are considered prominent candidates for the design of thermally stable and photoprogrammable helical LCs [24][25][26][27] . Diarylethenes adopt rapidly interconverting helical structures, and this conformational flexibility is the origin of racemate formation after ring-closure, locking the chirality. To induce a chiral preference upon photocyclization (Fig. 1a), chiral groups are necessarily attached to the photochromic moiety, making these switches suitable as chiral photoresponsive LC guests. Nonetheless, such extrinsic chiral groups usually generate low asymmetric induction in the photocyclization, producing a pair of diastereomers with opposite stereogenic centres 23 , thereby commonly inducing multiple helical domains and generating orientation disorder of the LCs with decreased optical efficiency.A mong soft supramolecular materials, liquid-crystal (LC) systems hold a prominent position that is reflected by their widespread use in imaging and display technology.

        <p>Here, we report dissymmetric chiral photosensitive diarylethene switches 1 and 2 with a sterically hindered ethene bridge and the unique feature of light-induced reversible transformation between the open forms of 1o and 2o, which have intrinsic axial chirality, and the closed forms 1c and 2c, which have central chirality. This avoids adverse factors incurred by extrinsic chiral moieties (Fig. 1b). Owing to the special molecular design, the diarylethene switch in its open state adopts two stable enantiomeric and non-interconvertible M-and P-helical structures, whereas in the closed state the central chirality is locked via covalent bonds. Furthermore, a judicious choice of mesogenic moieties decorating the central diarylethene photoswitch unit in 1 and 2 facilitates their miscibility with LCs and consequently enhances the fatigue resistance, HTP variation and stability. The enantiopure open forms (M)-1o and (M)-2o are converted in a stereospecific manner to the corresponding closed forms (S,S)-1c and (S,S)-2c, respectively, upon ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation.

        <p>Our design of photoswitches 1 and 2 (Fig. 1b; for the synthesis, characterization and properties, see Supplementary Figs. 1-25 and Supplementary Tables 34567891011) was inspired by the helical M and P enantiomers of the open form of phenanthrene-based diarylethenes 28 . It features a diarylethene core switching unit, which undergoes a reversible 6π electron photocyclization 23,29 . Distinct from numerous photochromic systems, it shows excellent thermal stability and fatigue resistance over multiple switching cycles. The photochemical switching with simultaneous modulation of the intrinsic chirality that is from axial to central chirality, along with the mesogenic groups to enhance the miscibility of these photoswitches in the LC matrix (as confirmed by the calculation of solubility parameters (Supplementary Table 1)), make these diarylethene compounds unique light-responsive dopants for the modulation of supramolecular organization and chirality in LC films. For comparison, an intrinsic chiral photoswitch (M)-3o without mesogenic groups 30 (Supplementary Fig. 17) and a diarylethene (S,S)-4o with pending chiral BINOL-derived groups 31 (Supplementary Fig. 2) are used to illustrate the distinct advantage of an intrinsic chiral LC dopant. To corroborate the difference in the level of stereocontrol, the photocyclization of our new switches with intrinsic chirality (M)-1o and those based on extrinsic chirality (S,S)-4o were studied. Chiral HPLC analysis illustrates the remarkable difference in stereoselectivity upon switching (Fig. 2a,b). With UV light irradiation, two diastereomers of the closed form (S,S)-4c are found with a d.e. as low as 10% (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 2). Doping an LC film with (S,S)-4c would produce multiple helical domains due to significant orientation disorder of the LCs. In stark contrast the enantiospecific ring-closure of the open form (M)-1o to the closed form (S,S)-1c generated a single species (Fig. 2a), which indicates an e.e. value of &gt;99%. The switching and chirality modulation achieved between (M)-1o and (S,S)-1c is exclusively induced by the enantiospecific intrinsic-chirality transformation during the fully reversible photocyclization process. The distinct advantage is that the orientational disorder or phase defects of the LCs caused by multiple chiral sources can be avoided. The circular dichroism (CD) spectra of (M)-1o and (S,S)-4o confirmed the difference in the absorption of CPL upon switching the components (Fig. 2c,d). The excellent thermal stability and fatigue resistance of our intrinsic chiral photoswitches 1 and 2 (with 3 and 4 for comparison) were demonstrated by almost invariable absorption during a 100 h period or via monitoring at least 30 switching cycles upon alternating UV and visible-light irradiation (Fig. 2e-g, Supplementary Fig. 26 and Extended Data Fig. 1).Our design of photoswitches 1 and 2 (Fig. 1b; for the synthesis, characterization and properties, see Supplementary Figs. 1-25 and Supplementary Tables 34567891011) was inspired by the helical M and P enantiomers of the open form of phenanthrene-based diarylethenes 28 .

        <p>For optical modulation of the PBG over a wide spectral range, the key to potential photonic applications, the prerequisites are a large molecular chirality fluctuation (that is, HTP variation) and multiple stable states in a broad dynamic range as well as robust photoswitching. Gratefully, the HTP variation of (M)-1o is as large as 88.58 μm -1 with a high initial value of 129.85 μm -1 , while (M)-2o has similar characteristics with an HTP variation of 87.28 μm -1 and an initial HTP of 144.55 μm -1 . For comparison, the HTP variation of the intrinsic chiral photoswitch (M)-3o without mesogenic moieties is only 24.11 μm -1 with an initial HTP value of 36.07 μm -1 (Supplementary Figs. 27-33 and Supplementary Table 2). Obviously, the presence of intrinsic chirality in combination with mesogenic moieties leads to enhancement of the HTP value as well as a large variation in the HTP, which we expect to allow dynamic reflection manipulation.For optical modulation of the PBG over a wide spectral range, the key to potential photonic applications, the prerequisites are a large molecular chirality fluctuation (that is, HTP variation) and multiple stable states in a broad dynamic range as well as robust photoswitching.

        <p>A photoresponsive helical LC system was prepared by incorporating the chiral photoswitch (M)-1o (0.85 mol%) into the twisted nematic LC (LCM17). The LC film exhibited a continuous and fast change of the reflection colour from the initial dark state, passing through the visible blue, green and red states to the photostationary state, upon UV light (365 nm) exposure for 17 s, as a result of the increase in the helical pitch (that is, a decrease of the HTP) (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Video 1). Full recovery was achieved using 530 nm visible-light irradiation for 33 s. As confirmed by the oily-streak texture, the initial helical arrangement was maintained during irradiation. Moreover, a reflection shift over a broad wavelength range was observed from 380 nm to the near-infrared band at 850 nm, covering the entire visible region and without any significant spectral deformation. By contrast, reflection wavelength shifts during light stimulation reported so far [31][32][33][34] have always been accompanied by insurmountable spectral deformation with abnormal bandwidth broadening, peak attenuation and numerous irregularities. The precise spectral modulation can be attributed to the weak influence of the intrinsic chirality on the LC long-distance orderliness during the photoisomerization of (M)-1o (ref. 35 ). A similar performance was achieved in the system containing (M)-2o (Extended Data Fig. 2).A photoresponsive helical LC system was prepared by incorporating the chiral photoswitch (M)-1o (0.85 mol%) into the twisted nematic LC (LCM17).

Therefore, multi-stability can be readily achieved, solving a major issue in current light-actuated soft-material systems. To further corroborate these findings, a patterned image was recorded in the photoresponsive LC sample using light passing through a photomask, showing the emergence of a well-defined blueish monkey face after UV irradiation for 5 s, which was followed by the successive colour change to green (8 s) and red (13 s) with sustained UV exposure (Fig. 3b(i-iii)).

        <p>To further explore the capability of such photoresponsive LC superstructure for optics, a series of micropatterns with typical optical diffraction effects were configured using light. A sample with an initial dark state at the near-UV reflection band was stimulated for 15 s using 365 nm light passing through a photomask with a periodic concentric-circle ring pattern, generating the corresponding binary optical micropattern with alternating dark and blue rings (Fig. 4a). This photoprogrammable micropattern could be readily re-programmed using additional predefined patterned irradiation to generate Fresnel-featured concentric rings or fork-shaped gratings with a topological optical singularity (Fig. 4b,c). Owing to the large HTP variation of (M)-1o, any desired micropattern colour can be dynamically transformed, selected and even extracted over a rela tively broad spectral range between 380 and 850 nm by accurately controlling the exposure time. For instance, three stable intermediate states like blue, green and red microstructure patterns are readily obtained and retained after removing the exposed light, which is unachievable for the majority of photoswitches (including the control compounds (M)-3o and (S,S)-4o). Notably, the observed sharp boundary between the two-colour regions indicates a weak orientation correlation of the LCs. Such microstructures can also be prescribed via the regional alignment, for example, photoalignment, for precise control of the orientation of the LCs at certain micro-regions near the cell substrate, enabling optical phase modulation of the system.To further explore the capability of such photoresponsive LC superstructure for optics, a series of micropatterns with typical optical diffraction effects were configured using light.

        <p>The binary colour can induce transmittance or reflectance differences with respect to an impinged light with the wavelength located at any of the PBGs of the two regions, thereby generating light diffraction. To demonstrate this, a 633 nm helium-neon (He-Ne) laser, which was insensitive to the photoswitch (M)-1o, was converted to a CPL probe beam to detect the diffraction of red-and-dark micropatterns (Fig. 4d). The characteristic and sharp diffraction patterns like the concentric circular lines, with a central focal point and doughnut-shaped diffraction spots, confirmed the micropattern regularity and further demonstrated the weak LC orientation correlation on the boundary. It has to be noted that such a weak correlation is commonly obtained using additional polymer stabilization. 36,37 The LC helical superstructure can also provide an elegant selforganized photonic microcavity to generate a narrow-band laser emission after homogeneously mixing a small amount of gain medium with it. With appropriate external pumping the emission is at the PBG band edge and indicates the feasibility of a wavelength-tunable laser based on this photoresponsive system. Towards this goal, a photochemically reversible modulated laser emission was established by doping the fluorescent dye DCJTB (Supplementary Fig. 34) into the helical LCs, thereby successfully achieving a wavelength shift from 609 to 659 nm accompanied by a successive colour change in the light emission from orange-red via ) Fig. 2 | HPLc, cD spectra, fatigue resistance and thermal stability comparisons: intrinsic chirality versus extrinsic chiral groups. a, Chiral HPLC chromatograms of (M)-1o (CH 3 CN, 0.5 ml min -1 , monitored at the isosbestic point of 320 nm). b, Chiral HPLC chromatograms of (S,S)-4o (CH 3 CN, 0.5 ml min -1 , monitored at the isosbestic point of 323 nm). c,d, CD spectra of (M)-1o (c) and (S,S)-4o (d). e,f, Fatigue resistance of (M)-1o (e) and (S,S)-4o (f). g, Thermal stability of the photostationary state of (M)-1o, (M)-2o, (M)-3o and (S,S)-4o in THF at 2.0 × 10 -5 M, irradiated with alternating UV light (λ = 313 ± 10 nm) and visible light (λ &gt; 480 nm).

The photoresponsive helical LC was prepared by mixing (M)-1o (0.85 mol%) with the commercially available twisted nematic LC, injecting it into a 4.9-µm-thick planar cell and reversibly modulating it by alternating the irradiation with 365 nm UV and 530 nm green light at 4.0 and 1.0 mW cm -2 , respectively. e, Tunable laser emission based on the photoresponsive helical LC achieved after doping with the gain medium DCJTB (0.77 mol%), the shifting of reflection spectrum with the light stimulation and, correspondingly, the simultaneous shifting of the emission spectrum at the band edge of the reflection spectrum. The inset images show the emission patterns at 609, 638 and 659 nm. f, Beam profile of the laser at 609 nm detected in the far-field region.The binary colour can induce transmittance or reflectance differences with respect to an impinged light with the wavelength located at any of the PBGs of the two regions, thereby generating light diffraction. To demonstrate this, a 633 nm helium-neon (He-Ne) laser, which was insensitive to the photoswitch (M)-1o, was converted to a CPL probe beam to detect the diffraction of red-and-dark micropatterns (Fig. 4d). The characteristic and sharp diffraction patterns like the concentric circular lines, with a central focal point and doughnut-shaped diffraction spots, confirmed the micropattern regularity and further demonstrated the weak LC orientation correlation on the boundary. It has to be noted that such a weak correlation is commonly obtained using additional polymer stabilization. 36,37 The LC helical superstructure can also provide an elegant selforganized photonic microcavity to generate a narrow-band laser emission after homogeneously mixing a small amount of gain medium with it. With appropriate external pumping the emission is at the PBG band edge and indicates the feasibility of a wavelength-tunable laser based on this photoresponsive system. Towards this goal, a photochemically reversible modulated laser emission was established by doping the fluorescent dye DCJTB (Supplementary Fig. 34) into the helical LCs, thereby successfully achieving a wavelength shift from 609 to 659 nm accompanied by a successive colour change in the light emission from orange-red via ) Fig. 2 | HPLc, cD spectra, fatigue resistance and thermal stability comparisons: intrinsic chirality versus extrinsic chiral groups. a, Chiral HPLC chromatograms of (M)-1o (CH 3 CN, 0.5 ml min -1 , monitored at the isosbestic point of 320 nm). b, Chiral HPLC chromatograms of (S,S)-4o (CH 3 CN, 0.5 ml min -1 , monitored at the isosbestic point of 323 nm). c,d, CD spectra of (M)-1o (c) and (S,S)-4o (d). e,f, Fatigue resistance of (M)-1o (e) and (S,S)-4o (f). g, Thermal stability of the photostationary state of (M)-1o, (M)-2o, (M)-3o and (S,S)-4o in THF at 2.0 × 10 -5 M, irradiated with alternating UV light (λ = 313 ± 10 nm) and visible light (λ &gt; 480 nm).

Importantly, our system shows a sharp and smooth laser spectrum with a narrow bandwidth of less than 0.6 nm (Fig. 4e), which can even maintain an approximately fitted Gaussian intensity profile (Fig. 4f) over the entire stimulation. This excellent performance can most probably be attributed to the weak influence of the intrinsic chiral (M)-1o on the long-distance d, Optical setup used to receive the typical diffraction patterns in a-c, which were detected using a 633 nm laser.

The molecules with intrinsic chirality avoid the formation of multiple domains caused by diastereomers, thereby efficiently suppressing scattering loss and enhancing the optical efficiency.

        <p>Anti-counterfeiting is an indispensable technique for maintaining a fair market order and protecting consumer benefits 42 . However, it is challenging to balance the multi-functionalization, inimitability and visualization needed [43][44][45] . On the basis of the intrinsic chiral photoswitch, we demonstrate here an anti-counterfeiting technique using photoprogrammable pattern alignment. The chiral LC material based on (M)-1o was injected into a specially designed LC cell with a photoalignment-treated predefined pattern comprising the capital letters 'ECUST' and the corresponding two-dimensional barcode (that is, a QR code) (Fig. 5a). A high-reflectance uniformly oriented standing helix is generated in the patterned region while a low-reflectance randomly oriented helix with high light scattering is formed in the other regions. The pattern was initially hidden and emerged gradually upon irradiation with UV light at 365 nm, and was accompanied by a successive colour change over a broad range from blue, dark green, grass green, yellow to brown-red. The pattern disappeared again via visible-light irradiation at 530 nm (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Video 2). Importantly, every coloured pattern in the irradiated sample can be specifically extracted for detailed inspection after removing the light stimulus due to the excellent thermal stability of the intrinsic chiral photoswitch (M)-1o. As predicted by Bragg's law the pattern reflectance is strictly dependent on the viewing angle. When the material is viewed at the Bragg angle α, a coloured pattern is visible on a dark background, whereas at all other viewing angles a dark pattern is visible against a coloured background (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Videos 3 and 4). Notably, the anti-counterfeiting performances of the sample worked very well even after half a year, which is due to the stability and fatigue resistance of the intrinsic chiral photoswitch (Supplementary Video 5). A further important anti-counterfeiting technique was developed through embedding photoprogrammable invisible microsized structures into a QR code (Fig. 5d). For instance, three different well-defined microstructures were embedded using a regional photoprogrammable alignment technique and showed the characteristic associated optical diffraction patterns (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Videos 6 and 7). Moreover, a double-layered sample with a lower photoactive chiral LC layer that displayed a pre-designed image (that is, leaves) and an upper photoinactive chiral LC layer that displayed a matching image (that is, a trunk) was established. These anti-counterfeiting techniques show promising applications in the beverage industry (Supplementary Videos 8 and 9). Based on the chiral switchable LC dopant presented here, a multiple-state, inimitable and visualized anti-counterfeiting technique is demonstrated. It benefits from the intrinsic chirality of the helical system, showing the light-induced emergence and hiding of patterns, colour-tunability, readily digitalized extraction, reversible behaviour, viewing-angle-dependent reflectance and embeddable hidden microstructures. It shows multi-functionality that is enabled via a single matrix in a simple manner using light that offers prospects not only for anti-counterfeiting but also for responsive encryption. The major disadvantage of traditional photoswitches-in particular, azobenzenes and fulgide derivatives-is their thermal instability, which has been a formidable challenge until now for their practical application in dynamic and controllable photonics. Intrinsic chiral photoswitches allow large chirality fluctuations and weak orientation correlation, generating long-distance orderliness of LC soft superstructures using light within a reversible dynamic range, which is distinct from photoswitch-based systems so far. By avoiding the adverse factors incurred by extrinsic chiral moieties, the enantiospecific transformation from intrinsic axial to central chirality of the photoswitches induces a reflection modulation over a broad spectral range as well as a precise rewriting of a predefined image with sharp boundaries, thereby enabling light-activatable LC soft superstructures. These photoswitches show a large modulation of the HTP and solve serious bottlenecks seen with current modulation of superstructures using light, such as thermal instability, the limited dynamic range of the HTP and regional arrangement disturbance. In addition, the photoswitch facilitates multi-stable states that are controlled exclusively by light. This enables reversible digital programming and the selection and extraction of any desired images, patterns, characters and spectra to be controlled using irradiation. The photoprogramming and modulation of a predefined optical microstructure without the aid of additional polymer stabilization is also demonstrated. Moreover, a multiple anti-counterfeiting technique is established that enables the light-induced emergence and hiding of a pattern with a reversible colour change, with readily digitalized extraction and viewing-angle dependency of the predefined pattern. A system with embedded hidden microstructures offers bright prospects for future anti-counterfeiting methodology. Having established a basis for the digital programming of soft photonic superstructure materials with a unique intrinsic chirally responsive system, major opportunities arise towards non-linear dynamics, cybernetics and informatics, and on-demand reconfigurable complex systems.Anti-counterfeiting is an indispensable technique for maintaining a fair market order and protecting consumer benefits 42 .
