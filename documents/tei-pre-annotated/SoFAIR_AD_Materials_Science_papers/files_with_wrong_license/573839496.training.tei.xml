        <p>The evidence reported so far is summarized in Fig. 1c,d. K 3 C 60 powders were held at a base temperature of T ¼ 100 K  T c ¼ 20 K I and irradiated with 100-fs-long, 7.3-µm-wavelength (ℏω 170 meV I , where ħ is Planck's constant and ω is angular frequency) pulses at a fluence of 3 mJ cm -2 , which yielded a short-lived transient state with large changes in the terahertz optical properties. The transient optical response was probed with phase-sensitive, time-domain terahertz spectroscopy, which directly yields the real and imaginary part of the reflectance and hence can be used to retrieve the complex optical conductivity without the need of Kramers-Kronig transformations (Supplementary Section 4 and refs. 6,7 ). The transient low-frequency optical conductivity induced by femtosecond excitation was almost indistinguishable from that of the equilibrium superconducting state measured in the same material at T  T c ¼ 20 K I (compare to Fig. 1c). Such 'superconducting-like' optical properties consist of a perfect low-energy reflectance (R = 1), a vanishingly small real part of the optical conductivity σ 1 (ω) for all photon energies lower than the energy gap 2Δ and an imaginary conductivity σ 2 (ω) that diverges toward low frequencies as 1/ω, which itself is indicative of a large zero-frequency conductivity.The evidence reported so far is summarized in Fig. 1c,d.

        <p>These observations have generated interest, as they may make it possible to achieve photo-induced superconducting states [4][5][6][7]9,16,17 at or in the vicinity of room temperature. However, all of the experiments reported have indicated the presence of states that disappear immediately after optical excitation (see optical properties measured at 5 ps time delay in Fig. 1d). These short lifetimes would prevent most applications and have even raised controversy over the data interpretation itself 18,19 .These observations have generated interest, as they may make it possible to achieve photo-induced superconducting states [4][5][6][7]9,16,17 at or in the vicinity of room temperature.

        <p>In this Article, we explore the possibility of longer-lived superconductivity under a sustained optical drive. First, we modified the experimental set-up used for the experiments shown in Fig. 1 and lengthened the 7.3 µm wavelength pump pulses by making them propagate in a dispersive CaF 2 rod (Fig. 2a). These chirped pump pulses had a duration τ p ≈ 1 ps, which enabled a sixfold increase in the pulse energy density (up to 18 mJ cm -2 ) without a corresponding increase in the peak electric field. This longer pulse duration allowed us to conduct these experiments at pulse energy densities that would damage the sample at femtosecond pulse durations, and hence it enabled the exploration of a new regime of excitation.In this Article, we explore the possibility of longer-lived superconductivity under a sustained optical drive.

        <p>The pump-induced changes in the low-frequency reflectivity and complex optical conductivity (Fig. 2b) were measured on the same sample and at the same temperature T = 100 K as for the experiments of Fig. 1. Representative reflectivity spectra R(ω) and complex optical conductivity, σ 1 (ω)+iσ 2 (ω), measured for a 1 ps pump-pulse duration and 18 mJ cm -2 fluence are reported for time delays of -5 ps, 10 ps, 300 ps and 12 ns. These plots indicate a similar response to that shown in Fig. 1d (perfect reflectivity (R = 1), gapped σ 1 (ω) and a divergent σ 2 (ω)), although with a far longer relaxation time of at least 300 ps.The pump-induced changes in the low-frequency reflectivity and complex optical conductivity (Fig. 2b) were measured on the same sample and at the same temperature T = 100 K as for the experiments of Fig. 1.

        <p>A more comprehensive exploration of sustained optical driving, beyond the limited pulse-width tunability of the set-up shown in Fig. 2, is shown in Figs. 3, 4 and 5. These measurements made use of a newly developed optical device, based on a CO 2 -gas laser that was optically synchronized to a femtosecond Ti:Al 2 O 3 laser, and that delivered 10.6 µm wavelength pulses with durations that could be tuned between 5 ps and 1.3 ns (Fig. 3a). Excitation of high-T c cuprates and certain organic superconductors with intense far-infrared optical pulses has been shown to create non-equilibrium states with optical properties that are consistent with transient high-temperature superconductivity. These non-equilibrium phases have been generated using femtosecond drives, and have been observed to disappear immediately after excitation, which is evidence of states that lack intrinsic rigidity. Here we make use of a new optical device to drive metallic K 3 C 60 with mid-infrared pulses of tunable duration, ranging between one picosecond and one nanosecond. The same superconducting-like optical properties observed over short time windows for femtosecond excitation are shown here to become metastable under sustained optical driving, with lifetimes in excess of ten nanoseconds. Direct electrical probing, which becomes possible at these timescales, yields a vanishingly small resistance with the same relaxation time as that estimated by terahertz conductivity. We provide a theoretical description of the dynamics after excitation, and justify the observed slow relaxation by considering randomization of the order-parameter phase as the rate-limiting process that determines the decay of the light-induced superconductor. Near-infrared femtosecond pulses from a Ti:Al 2 O 3 laser were converted to a wavelength of 10.6 µm with an optical parametric amplifier and were used to seed a CO 2 laser oscillator 20 . The oscillator emitted trains of nanosecond-long pulses, out of which the most intense was selected by a Pockels cell and amplified to an energy of 10 mJ in a second, multi-pass CO 2 laser amplifier.

        <p>The 'front' and the 'back' of the 1-ns-long CO 2 pulses were 'sliced' using a pair of photoexcited semiconductor wafers as plasma mirrors [21][22][23] . As the wafers were set at Brewster's angle and their bandgap was much larger than the 117 meV photon energy of the CO 2 laser, these were almost perfectly transparent when unexcited. Pairs of femtosecond optical pulses struck each wafer at adjustable time delays, making these reflective owing to the injection of dense electron hole plasmas.

        <p>In this context, questions remain about the microscopic origin of the metastable light-induced superconducting state. From the observation that the amplitude of the effect is dependent only on the integrated pulse area, it becomes clear that, at least in the long-pulse regime, the previously proposed non-linear phonon mechanism 6 , which was suggested to generate a displaced crystal structure, is most likely not correct. If it were correct, one would expect a response that depends on some power of the electric field, rather than on only the total energy of the pulse. That said, mechanisms based on the parametric coupling of the light field to the electronic properties, either to amplify a superconducting order parameter [31][32][33] or to cool selected degrees of freedom 34,35 , are not necessarily inconsistent with these observations.In this context, questions remain about the microscopic origin of the metastable light-induced superconducting state.

That said, mechanisms based on the parametric coupling of the light field to the electronic properties, either to amplify a superconducting order parameter [31][32][33] or to cool selected degrees of freedom 34,35 , are not necessarily inconsistent with these observations.</p>
        <p>Our findings prompt comparison with previously measured responses that were observed under sustained driving, such as the microwave enhancement of conventional superconductivity 36,37 . One evident difference with these measurements is that the temperature scale observed here is far larger than that reported in the microwave-enhancement case. Furthermore, in the case of microwave-enhanced Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductivity, the effect was observed only for excitation below the superconducting gap, which was interpreted to be a result of quasi-particle redistribution and of renormalization of the parameters entering the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer equations 38 . In the microwave experiments, complementary measurements, in which excitation was tuned immediately above the gap, yielded a reduction of the superconducting order.Our findings prompt comparison with previously measured responses that were observed under sustained driving, such as the microwave enhancement of conventional superconductivity 36,37 .

        <p>Here, our experiments are conducted in a different regime; that is, at pump-photon energies that are at least one order of magnitude larger than the low-temperature equilibrium superconducting gap, and in a regime in which the primary coupling of the mid-infrared radiation is not with the condensate, but with other high-energy excitations, such as molecular vibrations or collective electronic modes. Hence, it is unlikely that the mechanism invoked for microwave enhancement can explain these observations. Other experimental reports have documented a sustained, metastable enhancement of superconductivity in oxygen-deficient YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7-δ samples after exposure to radiation with frequencies ranging from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared [39][40][41] . However, in all of these cases, the superconducting transition temperature of the irradiated superconductor never exceeded the equilibrium transition temperature at optimal doping. These observations were either interpreted as a result of photodoping towards a more metallic state favouring superconductivity, or involved annealing of oxygen-deficient samples. By contrast, the data reported here show enhanced superconducting properties well above the highest equilibrium transition temperature observed in any one of the A 3 C 60 compounds 13 , by excitation with photon energies away from inter-band transitions. Therefore, none of the previously invoked mechanisms offers a plausible explanation for our findings.Here, our experiments are conducted in a different regime; that is, at pump-photon energies that are at least one order of magnitude larger than the low-temperature equilibrium superconducting gap, and in a regime in which the primary coupling of the mid-infrared radiation is not with the condensate, but with other high-energy excitations, such as molecular vibrations or collective electronic modes.

        <p>The discovery of a metastable light-induced state with clear signatures of superconductivity holds compelling promise in the quest to extend lifetimes even further. New lasers that are capable of generating longer pulses or suitably designed trains of pulses could be developed to sustain the coherence of this state. Extended lifetimes will also open up the possibility of studying these effects with other low-frequency probes, which range from measurements of magnetic susceptibility to scattering and transport methods. Recent theoretical 42 and experimental 43 reports suggest that the superconducting order parameter can be influenced also by the electromagnetic environment of an optical cavity. Indeed, observations made in alkali-doped fullerides 43 could be expanded on by combining cavity settings with external driving 44 as a means to reduce the required excitation and hence dissipation and heating.The discovery of a metastable light-induced state with clear signatures of superconductivity holds compelling promise in the quest to extend lifetimes even further.
