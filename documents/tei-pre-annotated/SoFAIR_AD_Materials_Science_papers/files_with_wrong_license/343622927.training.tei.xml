        <p>The "plastic problem" originated around 70 years ago (1950) with the start of its large-scale production (Geyer et al., 2017). Since then, in 2018, the plastic produced in Europe is close to 62 million tons, while in the same year 359 million tons were produced worldwide (Statista, 2018).The "plastic problem" originated around 70 years ago (1950) with the start of its large-scale production (Geyer et al., 2017).

        <p>Due to their resistance to biodegradability, plastics accumulate rather than decompose when disposed in landfills or released in the environment (Geyer et al., 2017).Due to their resistance to biodegradability, plastics accumulate rather than decompose when disposed in landfills or released in the environment (Geyer et al., 2017).</p>
        <p>The term "microplastics" includes all plastic particles with dimensions less than 5 mm. They are found in the environment as primary microplastics, deliberately manufactured in micro-sizes or as secondary microplastics generated by the fragmentation of larger plastic litter (Duis and Coors, 2016). Due to the increasingly widespread presence of microplastics in different ecosystems, these materials attracted the global attention as emerging "new generation" contaminants (Karthik et al., 2018;Tang et al., 2018;Zhao et al., 2018;Zhu et al., 2018;Di and Wang, 2018;Lin et al., 2018;Rodrigues et al., 2018;Sighicelli et al., 2018;Horton et al., 2017;Zhang and Liu, 2018).The term "microplastics" includes all plastic particles with dimensions less than 5 mm.

        <p>Agro-ecosystems are considered the main source of microplastic pollution in terrestrial environments (Ng et al., 2018). In fact, in these ecosystems, primary microplastics come from the application of sewage sludge used to fertilise the soil; while, secondary microplastics can originate from plastic mulch films or from plastic materials used to cover greenhouses. The process of plastic fragmentation producing secondary microplastics can originate not only from agricultural practices, but also from the environmental exposure itself due to the destructive action of exposure to sunlight and temperatures (Horton et al., 2017;Lv et al., 2019). The deposition and movement of microplastics in soil are influenced by both biota activities and soil tillage. Main responsible for the downward movement are biopores created by soil biota or soil cracking (Rilling et al., 2017;Majadlani et al., 2008); while the horizontal movement of microplastics is caused by harvesting and ploughing (Paustian et al., 1997). The physical properties of microplastics (i.e. size, shape and hydrophobicity) can influence their transport within the soil (Rilling et al., 2017;Wan and Wilson, 1994). Furthermore, the distribution of microplastics is influenced by sequestering processes such as soil aggregation (Peng et al., 2017). Plants are not expected to absorb or translocate microplastics. In fact, the high molecular weight of microplastics and/or their large size (Teuten et al., 2009) prevent penetration through cell wall at the root level. On the other hand, there is no experimental evidence that confirms the toxicity of nano-and microplastics on plants (Ng et al., 2018). The researches performed from Lin et al (2009) and Liu et al (2009), respectively on rice and Nicotiana tabacum, pointed out the capacity of plant cells to uptake carbon-based nanotubes and fullerenes. Subsequently, other studies were conducted on the effects of nanoparticles on edible crops; highlighting a wide range of positive, negative and neutral interactions (Husen and Siddiqi, 2014;Ma et al., 2010;Rico et al., 2011;Wang et al., 2016). Plants are organisms capable of metabolizing a wide range of pollutants, such as polychlorinated compounds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Sanderman Jr., 1992). Others chemical pollutants released by plastic (Fossi et al., 2016) could be absorbed by plants and could cause oxidative stress during the activation of the metabolic patterns of the plant (Choudury et al., 2013).Agro-ecosystems are considered the main source of microplastic pollution in terrestrial environments (Ng et al., 2018).

        <p>To evaluate the response of plants to different microplastics, this study used Lepidium sativum L., also known as garden cress, a fast-growing annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family, as model species. It is a species native from Egypt and Asia but now it is widespread at world level for culinary and phytotherapeutically purposes (Nehdi et al., 2012). Its high sensitivity to phytotoxic substances makes it suitable for biological tests (Janecka and Fijalkowski, 2008;Smolinska and Leszczynska, 2017). The physiological and biochemical mechanisms involved in stress, caused by the exposure to microplastics, are not completely understood and clarified.To evaluate the response of plants to different microplastics, this study used Lepidium sativum L., also known as garden cress, a fast-growing annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family, as model species.

        <p>Normally, phytotoxicity is related to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anion, and hydroxyl radical (Choudury et al., 2013). The ROS accumulation in plant cell leads to an impairment of plant growth, photosynthesis, and biochemical processes (Choudury et al., 2013). Several studies indicate that the exposure of the plant to abiotic stresses, such as heavy metals, affect the production of chlorophylls and carotenoids by interfering with the synthesis of chlorophyll by the inhibition of enzymes involved in this process (Van Assche and Clijster, 1990;Kastori et al., 1998;Lenti et al., 2002). To counteract oxidative stress, plants have developed an antioxidant system that involves a lot of products such as glutathione (GSH), and ascorbic acid (AA) (Choudury et al., 2013).Normally, phytotoxicity is related to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anion, and hydroxyl radical (Choudury et al., 2013).

        <p>The aim of this paper is to better understand the mechanisms caused and connected to phytotoxicity of microplastics. In the present study, we tested under controlled conditions, different times of exposure related to acute and chronic toxicity caused by four different kinds of microplastics supplied to Lepidium sativum: polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), polyvinylchloride (PVC), and a commercial material used in agriculture (mixture of PE+PVC). Effects accounted were biometric parameters such as percentage inhibition of seed germination, plant height, leaf number and fresh biomass production. Oxidative stress (hydrogen peroxide, glutathione, ascorbic acid) was also evaluated as biochemical effects following the exposure to microplastics. On plants exposed to chronic stress chlorophylls, carotenoids, aminolaevulinic acid, and proline production were also evaluated. We hypothesized that L. sativum treated with several types of microplastic under different exposure temporal length (short and long), will respond differently about its growth and physiological mechanisms following the activation of metabolic response to toxicity.The aim of this paper is to better understand the mechanisms caused and connected to phytotoxicity of microplastics.

        <p>In chronic toxicity experiment, seeds were sown in pot (5.5 cm diameter x 6 cm depth) containing 50 mL of natural soil already dried, with the field capacity assessed, and microplastics added. One seed per pot and 10 seeds per treatment were sown; plants were regularly monitored and watered, twice a week with 8.5 mL of Milli-Q water per time and they were sampled after 21 days from sowing. In both toxicity tests, plants were grown in a climatic chamber under controlled environmental conditions (temperature ranging between 17-20 °C; relative air humidity ranging between 40-60 %; photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 700 μmolm -2 s -1 for 14 h per day (from 06:00 to 20:00 local time). All the experiment was carried out by applying five different treatment conditions: i) control (C), plants were exposed only to natural soil; ii) soil added with polyethylene (PE); iii) soil added with polyvinylchloride (PVC); iv) soil added with polypropylene (PP); v) soil added with a commercial material used in agriculture (mixture of PE+PVC). In this study we added 0.02% (w/w) of microplastic to soil. Tested concentration was 5 time less than exposure levels used by Rychter et al. (2010). About 0.092 g (±0.002 g) of microplastic were added to 500 mL of natural soil (500 g of soaked soil; 184±4 mg/kg). Soil used to set experiments was collected by a local operator from a natural unpolluted protected area (Regional Natural Park). To evaluate levels of microplastics in natural soil used to perform experiments, levels of microplastics were determined on three replicates (n=3) following extraction and chemical quantification methods reported by literature for sediments (Renzi et al., 2020). Results highlighted microplastic pollution in natural soil was &lt;0.5 mg/kg. Microplastics fragments were obtained by grinding, with liquid nitrogen, of larger pieces. Obtained powder was then sieved by 0.125 mm ASTM sieve to remove larger plastic fragments. The powder passed the sieve was collected and rapidly washed with ethanol 75% and subsequently dried in oven at 40°C in a large glass-made Petri capsule. Plant height and leaf number were measured once per week. Germination rate were measured after 6 days from the begin of the experiment; percentage inhibition of seed germination (I%) was calculated using the following formula (ISO, 2016):In chronic toxicity experiment, seeds were sown in pot (5.5 cm diameter x 6 cm depth) containing 50 mL of natural soil already dried, with the field capacity assessed, and microplastics added.

        <p>Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) was measured spectrophotometrically after reaction with potassium iodide (KI), according to a method proposed by Alexieva et al. (2001). The reaction was developed in trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and absorbance was measured at 390 nm. The amount for H 2 O 2 was calculated using standard curve prepared with known concentrations of H 2 O 2 . The results were expressed as µg*g -1 fresh leaf weight (f.l.w.). Ascorbic acid (AsA) concentration was determined through the method proposed by Okamura (1980) and modified by Law et al. (1983). The assay was based on the reduction of Fe 3+ to Fe 2+ by ascorbate (As) in acidic solution. The absorbance at 525 nm was recorded. A standard curve of ascorbic acid (AsA) was used for calibration. Results were expressed as µg*g -1 f.l.w. Glutathione (GSH) was determined using a modification of the Sedlak and Lindsay (1968) method. The determination was obtained through the extraction in TCA and reaction with Ellman's reagent; the absorbance was read at 412 nm. A standard curve of GSH was used for calibration. The results were expressed as µg*g -1 f.l.w. Proline extraction and determination were performed according to Bates et al (1973) with slight modifications.

        <p>About 0.3 g of fresh leaf sample was homogenized with 6 mL of 80% acetone; then, sample mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were used to determine the chlorophylls and carotenoids content. Chlorophylls and carotenoids content were estimated by measuring the absorbance at 470, 645, and 663 nm. Then, chlorophyll-a, chlorophyll-b, total chlorophylls and carotenoids were further calculated according to formulae described by the literature (Bhushan et al., 2007).

ANOVA analyses show a significant interaction effect between treatments at the following significance levels: I% (p &lt; 0.001), H (p = 0.021), and B (p = 0,034). I% showed higher value when plants are exposed to PE or PE+PVC; while controls showed I% below 10%. Similarly, shoot heights (H) are more influenced by PE and PE+PVC treatments, while controls showed the highest mean value (0.378±0.05 cm). Although not statistically significant, leaf number showed lower values for PE and PE+PVC treatments. Noteworthy, the biomass production (B) showed a slightly different trend from the other biometrical parameters, in fact only the treatment with PE confirmed other parameters showing a lower value compared to control; while all other treatments showed biomass production higher than control.Acute toxicity experiments (6 days).

The same trend was observed for biomass production, in fact the same treatments showed the lowest biomass production recorded. Conversely, plants H and #L are not statistically significant for all tested microplastic treatments. Although leaf number is not statistically significant, compared to control (C), PE+PVC treated plants showed similar values; while PVC, PE, and PP showed lower values.

Noteworthy, is that these last two treatments showed a lowest germination compared to others.

        <p>As far as we know, the only studies that have addressed the plant-microplastic interaction, are those that involved the effects of mulching films, such as polyethylene and biodegradable microplastics; furthermore, existing studies are focused only on assess the impact induced on plants in terms of yield and biomass produced without investigate more deeply: in other words, existing studies that have a more agronomic than physiological imprint.

        <p>Researches performed on Triticum aestivum found that starch-based biodegradable microplastics negatively affect biometric traits such as plant height, leaf number, and biomass producing more strongly effects than low-density polyethylene microplastics (Qi et al., 2018). On the contrary, on turnip, radish, cress, and monocotyledonous oat the poly-(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate), a plastic mulch film known as PBAT, highlighted no effect on the growth of tested plants (Muroi et al., 2016;Rychter et al., 2010).Researches performed on Triticum aestivum found that starch-based biodegradable microplastics negatively affect biometric traits such as plant height, leaf number, and biomass producing more strongly effects than low-density polyethylene microplastics (Qi et al., 2018).

        <p>Recent studies (Machado et al., 2018;Wan et al., 2019;Rillig et al., 2019;Rillig et al., 2017) have focused only on movement, consequences and fate of microplastics in soil, without investigate their effect at physiological level on exposed plants. In other words, for the plants, no yet answer was found if there is an effect in terms of ROS and antioxidants production when microplastics are added to the soil. Furthermore, is it right to say that microplastics are "considered" as abiotic stress factor? Increase in the reactive oxygen species production (ROS) is the key response of plants to stressful environments; ROS can be formed in plants through many reactions in which oxygen (O 2 ) undergoes reduction to superoxide or hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). Superoxide can be chemically reduced or dismutated to H 2 O 2 , a reaction that is accelerated by superoxide dismutase (SODs) (Noctor et al., 2018). Results obtained in this study concerning the production of hydrogen peroxide showed a generally higher H 2 O 2 concentration in acute than chronic toxicity. Specifically, plants exposed to acute experiments and treated with PE, showed the highest concentration than all the other plastics treatments; and this is in agreement with biometrical traits results. However, interestingly, PVC treated plants kept the same levels in either acute or chronic tests. This latter treatment, after chronic exposure, highlighted the highest H 2 O 2 production, followed by PE-treated plants. Therefore, not only from a biometric but also from a biochemical point of view, different microplastics, supplied to plants for different time exposure, act in different ways in terms of quantity production. In fact, PE-exposed plants during short-term experiments, showed higher H 2 O 2 production, while after long-term exposure, higher H 2 O 2 production was shown by PVC-treated plants. This latter treatment, it is the only one that did not show different concentration between the acute and chronic exposure; this can be explained by the fact that the PVC-induced stress is "detected" before than the other microplastic stressors tested in this study, and that during the time lapse of the chronic exposure, plants are not able to counteract PVC toxicity. On the other hand, a reaction by plant was in some cases recorded, such as, for PE+PVC and PP treatments that showed the same concentrations recorded in control at the end of the chronic exposure.Recent studies (Machado et al., 2018;Wan et al., 2019;Rillig et al., 2019;Rillig et al., 2017) have focused only on movement, consequences and fate of microplastics in soil, without investigate their effect at physiological level on exposed plants.

        <p>The high production of H 2 O 2 in plants is due both to its function as a signalling molecule and to the multiple enzymes that uses it as a substrate (Noctor et al., 2018;Foyer et al., 2016;Noctor et al., 2002), and consequently, they trigger the production of low molecular weight compounds with antioxidant action (Noctor et al., 2015;Couèe et al., 2006). The ascorbate and glutathione play an important role, as they react rapidly with H 2 O 2 through specific enzymes, the peroxidases, meanwhile their oxidized forms are regenerated by reductases. This trait allows the redox cycle to repeat itself which in turn regulates the cellular redox state (Foyer and Noctor, 2011). The glutathione plays multiple roles: as an antioxidant in counteracting ROS, as a reducing agent for superoxide and as a substrate for other enzymes (Polle, 2001;Tarrago et al., 2009). Foyer and Noctor (2011) highlighted that the main role of glutathione in H 2 O 2 metabolism may be in regenerating ascorbate from dehydroascorbate (DHA), or via dehydroascorbate reductases (DHAR).The high production of H 2 O 2 in plants is due both to its function as a signalling molecule and to the multiple enzymes that uses it as a substrate (Noctor et al., 2018;Foyer et al., 2016;Noctor et al., 2002), and consequently, they trigger the production of low molecular weight compounds with antioxidant action (Noctor et al., 2015;Couèe et al., 2006).

        <p>The most important role exerted by ascorbate, on the other hand, is the ability to directly remove ROS (Noctor et al., 2011). The results obtained in this study on antioxidants showed that, at the end of the acute exposure tests, the concentration of ascorbic acid (AsA) is lower than the levels measured at the end of the chronic exposure for all tested microparticles types. Conversely, glutathione (GSH), showed an opposite production only for PVC treated plants and controls. From a more in-depth analysis, it emerged that the plants treated with PE and PVC showed lower AsA values compared to other treatments, under both after acute and chronic exposures. This result is in agreement with hydrogen peroxide trends, in fact the depletion of the antioxidant AsA could be explained by its counteracting action performed against this ROS. Concerning the other treatments, in chronic toxicity PE+PVC and PP showed almost the same levels of AsA compared to controls, also in agreement with the H 2 O 2 results. On the contrary, in acute tests, there was a trend slightly different from chronic exposure. In fact, only the plants treated with PP showed the same AsA values shown by the control and PE+PVC had lower values, indicating that, in this case, AsA could have been involved to counteract the beginning of the oxidative burst. Differently, in chronic experiments, PP-treated plants showed the highest GSH concentrations, such as for AsA. On the contrary, in PE-and PVC-treated plants, higher GSH associated to lower AsA values, can have a dualistic effect: both to directly counteract the oxidative stress following to the depletion of AsA, and to regenerate the ascorbate from the cycle of Haliwell-Asada (Foyer and Noctor, 2011). In acute exposure tests, a further different scenario is recorded: controls and PVC-treated plants showed the highest concentrations of both GSH and, in minor way, of AsA. In the case of plants treated with PVC, measured levels resulted similar to levels recorded during the chronic exposure for the hydrogen peroxide. This may support the hypothesis that stress induced by PVC is "detected" earlier by plants than stress induced by other types of microplastic considered in this study. This hypothesis will be verified by future further investigations sized to focus on specific molecular mechanisms involved.The most important role exerted by ascorbate, on the other hand, is the ability to directly remove ROS (Noctor et al., 2011).

        <p>Generally, abiotic stresses on plants (drought-, salt-, heavy metal-, chill-, heat-stress), cause damage to the biosynthesis of chlorophylls, this is reflected in the whole metabolism of tetrapyrrole (Dalal and Tripathy, 2012). In this study, microplastics did not affect the production of chlorophylls in chronic exposure tests and these findings are in agreement with literature (Qi et al., 2018). In this study, the treatments that showed lower pigment production were controls and plants treated with PE+PVC. This could be explained by the fact that a reduced production of pigments, caused in turn by a reduced production of aminolaevulinic acid (AlA), would down-regulate the transport of electrons to reduce the production of ROS (Dalal and Tripathy, 2012). In fact, both controls and plants treated with PE+PVC, did not show a significant amount of hydrogen peroxide compared to other treatments. On the contrary, plants treated with PE and PVC, showed a greater production of hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, the latter, showed a higher production of AlA which, as mentioned above, could work not only to counteract ROS production, but also for the chlorophyll production pathway. The accumulation of proline and its protective function during abiotic stresses (i.e. osmo-protectant and against oxidative burst activities), have already been reported in many researches (Szabados and Savoure, 2010). Interestingly, both proline and aminolaevulinic acid have almost the same trend, as reported by the results collected in this study. In fact, plants exposed to PVC-induced stress, showed the highest concentration of both proline and aminolaevulinic acids. This is an interesting result, because a previous study, on salt-induced stress demonstrated that proline and aminolaevulinic acid compete for their production because of sharing the same biosynthetic precursor (glutamic acid), in their pathway (Xiong et al., 2018). In fact, when AlA decreases, proline increases (Averina et al., 2010). Our results suggest that during microplasticsinduced stress there is no competition in favour of proline production, but on the contrary, an increase in both when stress is induced, as in the case of plants treated with PVC. At this point our Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f results showed that, for L. sativum, PVC showed the highest toxicity compared to other plastics materials, in fact both proline and AlA worked to counteract the production of hydrogen peroxide.Generally, abiotic stresses on plants (drought-, salt-, heavy metal-, chill-, heat-stress), cause damage to the biosynthesis of chlorophylls, this is reflected in the whole metabolism of tetrapyrrole (Dalal and Tripathy, 2012).
