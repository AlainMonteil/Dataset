        <p>Tissue adhesives and hemostatic agents have attracted tremendous attention as potential alternatives for tissue engineering and wound healing. [1] However,t hose adhesives are often associated with UV-induced crosslinking or chemical reactions,w hich can lead to secondary damage to traumatized tissues.F urthermore,d uring the wound healing process,t he very slow degradation of the adhesives prevents the migration of motile cells and inhibits the remodeling of extracellular matrix microenvironment, thus impeding wound healing.

        <p>Thec ontinuous need for novel adhesives has turned researchers attention to natural systems,for example,mussel secretions.I nt hese materials,t he interplay of multiple supramolecular interactions including electrostatic-, p-p-, hydrogen-and van der Waals bonds is responsible for their superb adhesive performance.Inthis context, catechol-based adhesives exhibit interesting adhesion properties to various surfaces due to the diverse covalent and noncovalent interactions of catechol binding moieties. [10][11][12][13][14][15][16] Other approaches are focusing on biomimetic small molecule systems, which exhibit weak adhesive behaviors. [17][18][19] Their biomedical applications are thus limited.

        <p>TheS UP-surfactant coacervates were prepared by electrostatic complexation of SUPs and the corresponding surfactants. [23,24] Ty pically,S UPs and surfactants were mixed in an aqueous solution with the initial molar ratio of lysine or glutamic acid to surfactant at 1:1. As ar esult, the solution became turbid and after centrifugation av iscous SUPsurfactant complex was obtained. This liquid-liquid phase separation behavior leads to the formation of proteinsurfactant coacervates. [25,26] Thew ater content was % 30 % (w/w) in the SUP-surfactant complexes as determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Figure S3). After lyophilizing for % 30 min, % 14 %o fw ater remained in the coacervate (Figure S4), resulting in the formation of the proteinbased adhesive (Figure 1C). To determine the composition of the SUP-surfactant complexes quantitatively,t he K18-NDP complex was characterized by 1 HNMR spectroscopy (Figure S5). Thea nalysis revealed the stoichiometry of K18 to NDP surfactant to be 1:17 (i.e., ca. 0.95 NDP surfactant molecules per lysine of the SUP), indicating that % 5% of lysine moieties were not complexed with the surfactant molecules.T herefore,w eh ypothesized that cation-p interactions between these free lysine residues and the DOPA phenyl groups may be present in the system, as observed in other polypeptide systems.

        <p>Subsequently,the adhesion performance of SUP glues was evaluated by uniaxial tensile testing.Atypical adhesion test setup is shown in Figure S6. All the tensile testing was performed under ambient conditions with different substrates,i ncluding steel, polyethylene (PE), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). It should be noted that the SUP glues and commercial cyanoacrylate-based glue (super glue) were tested in parallel for comparison.Subsequently,the adhesion performance of SUP glues was evaluated by uniaxial tensile testing.Atypical adhesion test setup is shown in Figure S6.

        <p>Thec harge ratio between lysine and NDP surfactant (Figures S7-S8) (1:0.5, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:5) was investigated firstly to determine the optimal molecular composition regarding the adhesion performance.Itwas found that theres as ubstantial increase in the breaking strength as the molar ratio of lysine/surfactant is increased until am aximum value of 6.3 MPa at a1:1 charge ratio was reached. Afterwards,the breaking strength decreased when the ratio was further increased from 1:1t o1:5. In particular, the fracture strength decreased by about one order of magnitude when fabricating the SUP-NDP complex in a1 :5 lysine/surfactant stoichiometry.U nder this condition, the 1 HNMR analysis of the glue showed that the stoichiometry of 4.9 NDP surfactant molecules to one lysine of the SUP was found in the SUP-NDP complex (Figure S9). In this case,cationic lysine residues are neutralized by too many sulfates of NDP,l eading to the difficulty in the formation of cation-p interaction. This behavior strongly suggests that cation-p interactions are important for the interfacial adhesion.

        <p>Thea dhesion performance of the K-NDP glue was then further evaluated on different substrates (steel, PE, and PVC) under dry conditions.T he K-NDP glue exhibited stronger adhesion performance on ametal substrate (steel) than nonmetal substrates (PE and PVC) (Figures 2A andS10). Taking K108-NDP as an example,afracture strength of 6.3 MPa on steel was observed. In contrast, the fracture strength of K108-NDP is only 2.1 MPa on PE and 1.2 MPa on PVC,r espectively.T he adhesion energies of K-NDP on different substrates are depicted in Figure 2E.T his behavior might be caused by the strong interactions between lysine residues from the SUPs and catechol moieties of the surfactants and the metal surface.Moreover,the adhesion performance of K-NDP glues became significantly stronger when increasing the molar mass of the SUP (Figure 2).

        <p>Next, the metal coordination effect on the adhesion property of K-NDP glue was investigated (Figure 2B). To mimic the ratio between Fe 3+ ions and DOPAf rom mussel adhesive,amolar ratio of metal ions to NDP of 1:3w as chosen. [31] Upon adding Fe 3+ ions in aqueous solution to the K-NDP coacervate,t he color of the complex turned black immediately,i ndicating the formation of catecholate complexes.T he absorbance peak at % 545 nm in the UV-vis spectrum (Figure S12) confirmed the formation of bis Fecatecholate. [32] As ar esult, the bonding strength of SUP glue increased another 2.5 times in adry environment. It should be mentioned that the adhesive performance of K108-NDP-Fe glue (13.5 AE 1.6 MPa) is even superior to cyanoacrylate-based glue (10.4 AE 0.6 MPa) on steel. [33] This behavior indicates that the Fe 3+ -catechol coordination bonds are of great importance for the overall performance of SUP-glue.Ina ddition to Fe 3+ ions,T b 3+ ions were also used to modulate the adhesion behavior of SUP-glues (Figures 2B andS13). Similarly,t he adhesion performances of K72-NDP and K108-NDP increased to 6.1 AE 1.4 MPa and 10.0 AE 2.1 MPa after treatment with Tb 3+ ions,r espectively.S imilarly,h igh values for the adhesion energies were obtained for the addition of metal ions (Figure 2F). To the best of our knowledge,the adhesion performance of K108-NDP mediated by metal ions were higher than any other reported protein-based and DOPAmimicking adhesive (Table S2). [34,35] To further prove the importance of metal ions in the SUP coacervate glues,b enzyl protection groups were installed at the catechol units in the NDP surfactant (BnNDP). Thebulk adhesion strength of K-BnNDP glue on steel was measured under the same conditions as K-NDP.I tt urned out that the breaking strength of K72-BnNDP glue was 5.7 AE 1.4 MPa, which is comparable to the Fe 3+ -mediated K72-BnNDPglue (5.3 AE 0.6 MPa) (Figures 2I andS14). This indicates that the metal coordination force was absent in the K-BnNDP system. Comparison with the breaking strength of K72-NDP on steel (4.1 AE 0.7 MPa, Figure 2B), the results confirmed the synergistic effect of catechol moieties and metal ions (Fe 3+ ions and Tb 3+ ions) for the robust adhesion performance (Figure 2J). It is important to note that the breaking strength of K72-BnNDP was higher than that of K72-NDP adhesive,suggesting additional contributions from the aromatic rings of BnNDP to the adhesion performance.Next, the metal coordination effect on the adhesion property of K-NDP glue was investigated (Figure 2B). To mimic the ratio between Fe 3+ ions and DOPAf rom mussel adhesive,amolar ratio of metal ions to NDP of 1:3w as chosen.

        <p>In addition to the DOPA-inspired NDP system, the scope of surfactants was further broadened to investigate further structure property relationships of the glue.A sat ypical aromatic rich photo-switchable molecule,a zobenzene was selected to study the effect of an increased p-system on the adhesive properties.T he negatively charged azo-based surfactant (NAT)w as investigated under similar conditions as the NDP-based glues (Figures 2C,G andS15). To our surprise,t he K-NAT glues exhibited even better adhesion performance on all different substrates.I np articular, the bonding strength of % 16 MPa of K108-NAT was higher than any other reported protein-based adhesive and even cyanoacrylate super glue (Table S2). [34] We speculate that the robust adhesion performance of K-NAT glues might be related to the presence of strong p-p stacking and cation-p interactions. [13,29,30,36] We also investigated photo-modulation of the adhesion performance by switching the azobenzene moiety from trans-to cis configuration. However,i tt urned out that the light irradiation with different wavelength didntc hange the adhesion performance of the K-NAT adhesive.In addition to the DOPA-inspired NDP system, the scope of surfactants was further broadened to investigate further structure property relationships of the glue.A sat ypical aromatic rich photo-switchable molecule,a zobenzene was selected to study the effect of an increased p-system on the adhesive properties.T he negatively charged azo-based surfactant (NAT)w as investigated under similar conditions as the NDP-based glues (Figures 2C,G andS15).

        <p>Furthermore,afamily of positively charged DOPA surfactants including PDD,P DO,a nd PDH was used to fabricate SUP glues by the complexation with anionic SUPs (E type). As shown in Figures 2D and2H,the E-PDD glues exhibited enhanced adhesion performance with increasing the SUP chain length (Figures S16-S18). Theh igher molecular weight of SUP would lead to the stronger supramolecular network formation of the glue system, thus enhancing the adhesion properties.B ased on these results,i tcan be concluded that the nature of SUP does not greatly affect the adhesion properties of the glue system. Important contributions to the strong adhesion behavior of SUP glues can be ascribed to the multiple supramolecular interactions in the system, especially the cation-p, p-p,a nd metal coordination interactions (Figure 2K).Furthermore,afamily of positively charged DOPA surfactants including PDD,P DO,a nd PDH was used to fabricate SUP glues by the complexation with anionic SUPs (E type).

        <p>Aside from dry surfaces,wet adhesion for SUP glues was investigated.

[37,38] Furthermore,the non-covalent adhesive behavior endows the SUP glues with additional attractive features.F irstly,S UP glues are cleanable and recyclable.T he SUP glues on surfaces can be removed under sufficiently high external shear due to the non-covalent interactions between SUP and surfaces (Figure S20).

        <p>To explore the biocompatibility of SUP glues,w ec ocultured SUP-surfactant complexes with A549 cancer cells and two normal cell lines including L929 cells (mouse fibroblast) and 293t cells (embryonic kidney,e pithelial) in ac oncentration regime from 5-100 mgmL À1 .A fter 24 ho f culturing in the presence of the SUP complexes in DMEM medium, the cell viability did not drop below 80 %e ven at ac oncentration of 100 mgmL À1 ,c onfirming the non-toxic nature of the SUP glues (Figures S23-24).To explore the biocompatibility of SUP glues,w ec ocultured SUP-surfactant complexes with A549 cancer cells and two normal cell lines including L929 cells (mouse fibroblast) and 293t cells (embryonic kidney,e pithelial) in ac oncentration regime from 5-100 mgmL À1 .A fter 24 ho f culturing in the presence of the SUP complexes in DMEM medium, the cell viability did not drop below 80 %e ven at ac oncentration of 100 mgmL À1 ,c onfirming the non-toxic nature of the SUP glues (Figures S23-24).</p>
        <p>Motivated by the extraordinary performance and nontoxic nature, ex vivo and in vivo applications of SUP glues including wound healing and adhesion on wet tissues (porcine skin and muscle) were investigated. Due to the excellent performance of SUP adhesives,t wo pieces of muscle and porcine skin were glued together.Asshown in Figure S25, the corresponding force-displacement curves showed that the peak force is % 180 mN,F /w equals % 26 Nm À1 ,a nd the adhesion energy is 4393 AE 1144 mJ m À2 on muscle,w hich is comparable to covalently cross-linked adhesives on soft tissues reported earlier. [39] Adhesion performance of SUP glue on porcine skin was further evaluated exhibiting ap eak force of % 150 mN,F /w equals % 20 Nm À1 ,a nd adhesion energy is 857 AE 218 mJ m À2 (Figure 3C). Such behaviors might be attributed to the non-covalent and possible covalent interactions between adhesives and tissue surfaces.S ubsequently,t he hemostatic properties of SUP glue were investigated in vivo.I tw as found that SUP glue exhibited tissue adhering and hemostatic features on bleeding models of pig liver and kidney inhibiting blood leakage within 10 s( Figures 3D,E). At the same time,there was no swelling observed in the SUP-surfactant coacervate glues,indicating their superior tissue adhesion behavior compared to hydrogel systems (Figure S26). [2,3,40,41] Regarding the control experiment employing commercial cyanoacrylate,this glue solidified quickly and the bleeding continued when the wound was treated with this material indicating that it is not suitable for hemostasis on tissues and organs (Figure S27). All the experiments above showed that the SUP glues are suitable for hemostatic application.Motivated by the extraordinary performance and nontoxic nature, ex vivo and in vivo applications of SUP glues including wound healing and adhesion on wet tissues (porcine skin and muscle) were investigated.

        <p>To further explore the potential of SUP glues for in vivo applications,w ound sealing and healing experiments were conducted on rat skin with linear openings of 1cmi nl ength (Figure 4A). Thec oacervates were used directly without further freeze-drying for in vivo applications.I ts hould be noted that the K72-surfactant adhesives were chosen as ar epresentative sample for in vivo tests due to the higher expression yield of K72 compared to K108. TheK 72-NDP, K72-NAT,s uture closure,a nd commercially available cyanoacrylate-based adhesive COMPONT were selected as the experimental groups,and an untreated blank defect was used as ac ontrol group (Figure 4B). Theq uantitative analysis of the healing progress over 9days showed that the group treated with SUP glues outperformed the other groups (Figure 4C)i ndicating the suitability of SUP glues for skin regeneration and application for topical wound healing.I n stark contrast to suture closure and commercial chemical adhesives,t he intrinsic biodegradability and the fact that the glue relies solely on multiple supramolecular interactions probably renders the SUP glue very well suited to accelerate the healing and regeneration of skin defects.To further explore the potential of SUP glues for in vivo applications,w ound sealing and healing experiments were conducted on rat skin with linear openings of 1cmi nl ength (Figure 4A).

        <p>Theh istological analyses,i ncluding Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining as well as Massonstrichrome staining further verified these results.T he H&amp;E staining demonstrated that wounds treated with K72-NDP glue and K72-NAT glue formed healthy epithelial tissue and new blood vessels, outperforming the recovery of the control groups (Figure 4D). In addition, Massonst richrome staining showed more collagen content with an intense blue color in the SUP glue treated groups compared to the other groups (Fig- ure 4E). It is well known that wound inflammation is one of the major causes of death among injured patients.T herefore, immunofluorescence analysis was used to assess the efficiency of the SUP glue in preventing wound inflammation. Tw o typical proinflammatory cytokines,i nterleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a)i nt he wound site were chosen as an evaluation criterion in this study.A ss hown in Figure 4F,ahigh level of IL-6 (red fluorescence) was detected in groups of suture closure,commercial medical glue,and the control, indicating as evere inflammatory response in the traumatized area. Moreover,i ntensive green fluorescence was detected in these control groups,suggesting high levels of secreted TNF-a (Figure 4G). Encouragingly,o nly minor green fluorescence could be detected for SUP glue treated groups,which indicated low signs of inflammation compared with the other samples.T hese results suggested that the biocompatible SUP glues exhibit superior anti-inflammation properties.T herefore,SUP glues are apotential candidate as aw ound repair material, providing ideal wound healing ability while avoiding inflammation.Theh istological analyses,i ncluding Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining as well as Massonstrichrome staining further verified these results.T he H&amp;E staining demonstrated that wounds treated with K72-NDP glue and K72-NAT glue formed healthy epithelial tissue and new blood vessels, outperforming the recovery of the control groups (Figure 4D).

        <p>Thes imple fabrication strategy,a llowing to electrostatically bond different surfactants equipped with various functionalities to ac harged polypeptide chain, represents an ovel paradigm to fabricate new bioinspired glues without large synthetic chemical efforts or lengthy cloning protocols or expression optimization. Besides,t he substitution of arginine for lysine may further modulate the adhesives performance due to stronger cation-p and electrostatic interactions. [42,43] Hence,t his electrostatic mediated two component glue will pave the way for promising applications in the field of surgery and soft tissue regeneration. In addition, the fusion of antimicrobial peptides or growth factors in this coacervate-based adhesive represents further means to increase the functionality of the glue.Thes imple fabrication strategy,a llowing to electrostatically bond different surfactants equipped with various functionalities to ac harged polypeptide chain, represents an ovel paradigm to fabricate new bioinspired glues without large synthetic chemical efforts or lengthy cloning protocols or expression optimization.
