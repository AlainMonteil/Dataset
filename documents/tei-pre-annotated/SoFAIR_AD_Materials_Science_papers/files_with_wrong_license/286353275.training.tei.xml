        <p>Energy storage is a global critical issue and important area of research as most of the renewable sources of energy are intermittent. In this research work, recently emerged inorganic nanomaterial (MXene) is used for the first time with paraffin wax as a phase change material (PCM) to improve its thermo-physical properties. This paper focuses on preparation, characterization, thermal properties and thermal stability of new class of nanocomposites induced with MXene nanoparticles in three different concentrations. Acquired absorbance (UV-Vis) for nanocomposite with loading concentration of 0.3 wt.% of MXene achieved ~39% enhancement in comparison with the pure paraffin wax. Thermal conductivity measurement for nanocomposites in a solid state is performed using a KD2 PRO decagon. The specific heat capacity (c p ) of PCM based MXene is improved by introducing MXene. The improvement of c p is found to be 43% with 0.3 wt.% of MXene loaded in PCM. The highest thermal conductivity increment is found to be 16% at 0.3 wt.% concentration of MXene in PCM. Decomposition temperature of this new class of nanocomposite with 0.3 wt.% mass fraction is increased by ~6%. This improvement is beneficial in thermal energy storage and heat transfer applications.Energy storage is a global critical issue and important area of research as most of the renewable sources of energy are intermittent.

        <p>Using renewable energies is one of the solutions for many environmental challenges that we face today. Solar energy is regarded as the most prominent source of renewable energy moving forward as the hourly incident solar flux on the surface of the earth is more noteworthy than annual global energy consumption [1]. Solar thermal harvesting was studied extensively over the last decade and therefore it became one of the most efficient and reliable technologies for supplying energy. To make thermal energy storage (TES) cost effective and efficient, further improvement with the introduction of emerging nano-materials is needed. TES offered promising solutions to the world's energy as well as environmental challenges [2,3]. An effective way to store thermal energy is employing a latent heat storage system with organic/inorganic phase change material (PCM). PCMs can absorb and/or release a remarkable amount of latent heat as a result of a phase transition when the phase transition temperature is within a specified temperature range. Phase change phenomenon (encapsulated PCM) is explained in Figure 1.Using renewable energies is one of the solutions for many environmental challenges that we face today.

        <p>Figure 1. Performance of organic/inorganic phase change materials in solid/liquid states (encapsulated PCM) [4] PCMs were applied in the area of both thermal isolation and energy storage, such as airconditioning [5], solar thermal storage [6,7], building energy management [8,9]. Phase change temperatures and phase transition enthalpies are dependent on materials [10]. The choice of a correct PCM depends generally on proper thermal characteristics for a specific application, in addition to its stability and cost. PCMs are classified into organic, inorganic, and eutectics according to their chemical composition and structure. Their details are explained in [4,11,12]. Paraffin, a mixture of mostly straight chain n-alkanes with general formula of CH 3 -(CH 2 ) n -CH 3 is probably the most common and widely used organic PCMs in many TES applications.Figure 1.

        <p>Paraffin waxes which are chemically compatible with most metals owing to the characteristics of large latent heat of fusion, high storage density, minimal tendency to super-cooling, desirable thermal and chemical stability, low vapor pressure of the liquid phase, non-toxic, noncorrosive, and relatively low price [10,13]. These clearly merit paraffin wax's utilization in TES applications for broad range of temperatures. In solar thermal systems, paraffin as a thermal energy reservoir (TER) absorbs thermal energy as heat during the day time (called charging process) when solar energy is accessible in sufficient amount and release the thermal energy over the night (called discharging process) [14]. Despite all its advantages, low thermal conductivity of paraffin wax (0.21-0.24 W/m K) can be a drawback in solar and high power applications that significantly decelerates the energy charging/discharging rates [2,13].

        <p>For the purpose of assessment, calculation and design of thermal systems, specific heat capacity is considered as one of the major parameters [52]. Thermal energy performance of the pure organic paraffin wax and PW70/MXene nanocomposites are examined using DSC. Distinct solid to liquid phase change peeks can be observed in Figure 7. Table 4 presents the all achieved data for c p measurements of pure organic PCM and PW70/MXene nanocomposites. The experimentally achieved DSC results of pure paraffin wax and PW70/MXene nanocomposites for specific heat capacity measurements are presented in Figure 7. 4). Acquired experimentally data for c p value (2.1 J/g K) of the pure paraffin wax at 25 °C is in good agreement with the provided data by supplier (2.2 J/g K) [34]. In Literature reports express that specific heat capacity of nanocomposites can be increased up to 25% compared with the base substance due to the presence of nanoparticles [55]. Wang et al. [24] applied a theoretical model to report that the c p value of nanoparticles can be enhanced when the size of nanoparticles is decreased. Less number of bonds in the surface area of the lattice of the nanoparticles causes the atoms to be less constrained. Lower natural frequency and higher amplitude of the vibrations of the atoms in the surface area can allow the bonds to act like spring.For the purpose of assessment, calculation and design of thermal systems, specific heat capacity is considered as one of the major parameters [52].

        <p>This phenomenon can be the cause of creation of interface interaction of atoms in surface area of two-dimensional materials (because of high surface area) with high surface energy atoms of the organic pure paraffin (C-H bonds). The created interactions between atoms can be the reason of the enhanced specific heat capacity of PW70/MXene nanocomposites. This mechanism is applicable in high temperatures as the temperature elevates the vibration of atoms. Enhancement of vibration will increase specific heat capacity, which is found experimentally in this study for new class of nanocomposites (PW70/MXene) with different mass fraction loadings of MXene flakes. Due to the C-H bond in the structure of organic phase change materials and high surface area of two-dimensional inorganic compound (MXene) it can be proposed that there is an electrostatic interaction between the induced MXene in PW70. The aforementioned interface interaction will cause to crystallize the particles of paraffin wax on the specific surface area of MXene. Large specific surface area and specific surface energy will contribute to the enhancement of the specific heat capacity. The acquired promising thermodynamic efficiencies at higher operating temperatures may reduce the final cost of the thermal systems which are working in the basis of thermal storage and thermal conductivity. An inexpensive method to reduce the cost of a system is to enhance the thermophysical properties of organic/inorganic phase change materials by doping them with minute concentration of nanoparticles. In a comprehensive research study performed by Malik [56], the preliminary cost models for inorganic phase change materials (alkalisalt eutectics) were investigated. In the above-mentioned study, the developed model for inorganic phase change material induced with alumina nanoparticles revealed cost-effectiveness by enhancement in the specific heat capacity value. The author demonstrated that a 30% enhancement in specific heat capacity would offer a 15% saving in solar thermal power systems. The abovementioned model can be extended for organic phase change materials as well. Thus, based on the developed model by Malik [56], the cost-effectiveness of the PW70/MXene nanocomposites for solar thermal power systems might be expected according to the experimentally achieved improvement specific heat capacity value. The required amount of thermal energy storage media in concentrated solar power plants can be reduced significantly decrease with enhancement of the specific heat capacity value, followed by a consequent reduction in the cost of electricity. as additive. This shows that the releasing energy in melting point occurs and heat transfer enhances in this crucial point. The experimentally acquired data for enthalpy of pure PCM is found to be 110.68 J/g (endothermic) which is in agreement with the provided data by the supplier (107 kJ/kg) [34]. The standard deviation for the enthalpy measurement is estimated to be ~ 3%. However, the achieved data for enthalpy of PW70/MXene for the concentrations of 0. nanocomposites with enhanced thermal storage and thermal conductivity, the effects of the number of layers, thickness and the size are of great interest for future studies.

        <p>conductivity measurements. It is observed that the addition of MXene into PW70 remarkably improved the nanocomposite's thermal conductivity. The enhancement can be attributed to the greater thermal conductivity of MXene at higher mass fractions in addition to the high surface area-to-volume ratio of MXene compared to that of paraffin wax. Nevertheless, the thermal resistance at the interface between MXene and PW70 could not be neglected. The previous studies have proved that the thermal boundary resistance rises up remarkably as the nanoparticle dimensionality escalates based on the results for two-dimensional materials included graphene nano plateletsconductivity measurements.
