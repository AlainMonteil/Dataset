        <p>The Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB) is a highly curated open database organising a wealth of computed properties for more than 4000 atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials. Here we report on new materials and properties that were added to the database since its first release in 2018. The set of new materials comprise several hundred monolayers exfoliated from experimentally known layered bulk materials, (homo)bilayers in various stacking configurations, native point defects in semiconducting monolayers, and chalcogen/halogen Janus monolayers. The new properties include exfoliation energies, Bader charges, spontaneous polarisations, Born charges, infrared polarisabilities, piezoelectric tensors, band topology invariants, exchange couplings, Raman spectra and second harmonic generation spectra. We also describe refinements of the employed material classification schemes, upgrades of the computational methodologies used for property evaluations, as well as significant enhancements of the data documentation and provenance. Finally, we explore the performance of Gaussian process-based regression for efficient prediction of mechanical and electronic materials properties. The combination of open access, detailed documentation, and extremely rich materials property data sets make the C2DB a unique resource that will advance the science of atomically thin materials.The Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB) is a highly curated open database organising a wealth of computed properties for more than 4000 atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials.

        <p>The discovery of new materials, or new properties of known materials, to meet a specific industrial or scientific requirement, is an exciting intellectual challenge of the utmost importance for our environment and economy. For example, the successful transition to a society based on sustainable energy sources and the realisation of quantum technologies (e.g. quantum computers and quantum communication) depend critically on new materials with novel functionalities. First-principles quantum mechanical calculations, e.g. based on density functional theory (DFT) [1], can predict the properties of materials with high accuracy even before they are made in the lab. They provide insight into mechanisms at the most fundamental (atomic and electronic) level and can pinpoint and calculate key properties that determine the performance of the material at the macroscopic level. Powered by high-performance computers, atomistic quantum calculations in combination with data science approaches, have the potential to revolutionise the way we discover and develop new materials.The discovery of new materials, or new properties of known materials, to meet a specific industrial or scientific requirement, is an exciting intellectual challenge of the utmost importance for our environment and economy.

        <p>Atomically thin, two-dimensional (2D) crystals represent a fascinating class of materials with exciting perspectives for both fundamental science and technology [2][3][4][5]. The family of 2D materials has been growing steadily over the past decade and counts about a hundred materials that have been realised in single-layer or few-layer form [6][7][8][9][10]. While some of these materials, including graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), have been extensively studied, the majority have only been scarcely characterised and remain poorly understood. Computational studies indicate that around 1000 already known layered crystals have sufficiently weak interlayer (IL) bonding to allow the individual layers to be mechanically exfoliated [11,12]. Supposedly, even more 2D materials could be realised beyond this set of already known crystals. Adding to this the possibility of stacking individual 2D layers (of the same or different kinds) into ultrathin van der Waals (vdW) crystals [13], and tuning the properties of such structures by varying the relative twist angle between adjacent layers [14,15] or intercalating atoms into the vdW gap [16,17], it is clear that the prospects of tailor made 2D materials are simply immense. To support experimental efforts and navigate the vast 2D materials space, first-principles calculations play a pivotal role. In particular, FAIR 5 [18] databases populated by high-throughput calculations can provide a convenient overview of known materials and point to new promising materials with desired (predicted) properties. Such databases are also a fundamental requirement for the successful introduction and deployment of artificial intelligence in materials science.Atomically thin, two-dimensional (2D) crystals represent a fascinating class of materials with exciting perspectives for both fundamental science and technology [2][3][4][5].

        <p>Many of the unique properties exhibited by 2D materials have their origin in quantum confinement and reduced dielectric screening. These effects tend to enhance many-body interactions and lead to profoundly new phenomena such as strongly bound excitons [19][20][21] with nonhydrogenic Rydberg series [22][23][24], phonons and plasmons with anomalous dispersion relations [25,26], large dielectric band structure renormalisations [27,28], unconventional Mott insulating and superconducting phases [14,15], and high-temperature exciton condensates [29]. Recently, it has become clear that long range magnetic order can persist [30,31] and (in-plane) ferroelectricity even be enhanced [32], in the single layer limit. In addition, first-principles studies of 2D crystals have revealed rich and abundant topological phases [33,34]. The peculiar physics ruling the world of 2D materials entails that many of the conventional theories and concepts developed for bulk crystals break down or require special treatments when applied to 2D materials [26,35,36]. This means that computational studies must be performed with extra care, which in turn calls for well-organised and welldocumented 2D property data sets that can form the basis for the development, benchmarking, and consolidation of physical theories and numerical implementations.Many of the unique properties exhibited by 2D materials have their origin in quantum confinement and reduced dielectric screening.

        <p>The Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB) [6,37] is a highly curated and fully open database containing elementary physical properties of around 4000 2D monolayer crystals. The data has been generated by automatic high-throughput calculations at the level of DFT and many-body perturbation theory as implemented in the 
            <rs type="software">GPAW</rs> [38,39] electronic structure code. The computational workflow is constructed using the atomic simulation recipes (ASR) [40]-a recently developed Python framework for high-throughput materials modelling building on the atomic simulation environment (ASE) [41]-and managed/executed using the

        <p>The C2DB differentiates itself from existing computational databases of bulk [43][44][45] and lowdimensional [11,12,[46][47][48][49][50] materials, by the large number of physical properties available, see table 1. The use of beyond-DFT theories for excited state properties (GW band structures and Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) absorption for selected materials) and Berry-phase techniques for band topology and polarisation quantities (spontaneous polarisation, Born charges, piezoelectric tensors), are other unique features of the database.The C2DB differentiates itself from existing computational databases of bulk [43][44][45] and lowdimensional [11,12,[46][47][48][49][50] materials, by the large number of physical properties available, see table 1.

        <p>In this paper, we report on the significant C2DB developments that have taken place during the past two years. These developments can be roughly divided into four categories: (1) General updates of the workflow used to select, classify, and stability assess the materials. (2) Computational improvements for properties already described in the 2018 paper. (3) New properties. (4) New materials. The developments, described in four separate sections, cover both original work and review of previously published work. In addition, we have included some outlook discussions of ongoing work. In the last section we illustrate an application of statistical learning to predict properties directly from the atomic structure.In this paper, we report on the significant C2DB developments that have taken place during the past two years.

        <p>Figure 1 illustrates the workflow behind the C2DB. In this section we describe the first part of the workflow Table 1. Properties calculated by the C2DB monolayer workflow. The computational method and the criteria used to decide whether the property should be evaluation for a given material is also shown. A ' * ' indicates that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is included. All calculations are performed with the 
            <rs type="software">GPAW</rs> code using a plane wave basis except for the Raman calculations, which employ a double-zeta polarised basis of numerical atomic orbitals [51]. The workflow behind the C2DB. After the structural relaxation, the dimensionality of the material is checked and it is verified that the material is not already present in the database. Next, the material is classified according to its chemical composition, crystal structure, and magnetic state. Finally, the thermodynamic and dynamic stabilities are assessed from the energy above the convex hull and the sign of the minimum eigenvalues of the dynamical matrix and stiffness tensor. Unstable materials are stored in the database; stable materials are subject to the property workflow. The C2DB monolayer database is interlinked with databases containing structures and properties of multilayer stacks and point defects in monolayers from the C2DB.

        <p>Given a prospective 2D material, the first step is to carry out a structure optimisation. This calculation is performed with spin polarisation and with the symmetries of the original structure enforced. The latter is done to keep the highest level of control over the resulting structure by avoiding 'uncontrolled' symmetry breaking distortions. The prize to pay is a higher risk of generating dynamically unstable structures.Given a prospective 2D material, the first step is to carry out a structure optimisation.

        <p>Covalently bonded clusters are identified through an analysis of the connectivity of the structures where two atoms are considered to belong to the same cluster if their distance is less than some scaling of the sum of their covalent radii, i.e. d &lt; k(r cov i + r cov j ), where i and j are atomic indices. A scaling factor of k = 1.35 was determined empirically. Only structures that consist of a single 2D cluster after relaxation are further processed. Figure 2 shows three examples (graphene, Ge 2 Se 2 , and Pb 2 O 6 ) of structures and their cluster dimensionalities before and after relaxation. All structures initially consist of a single 2D cluster, but upon relaxation Ge 2 Se 2 and Pb 2 O 6 disintegrate into two 2D clusters as well as one 2D and two 0D clusters, respectively. On the other hand, the relaxation of graphene decreases the in-plane lattice constant but does not affect the dimensionality. According to the criterion defined above only graphene will enter the database.Covalently bonded clusters are identified through an analysis of the connectivity of the structures where two atoms are considered to belong to the same cluster if their distance is less than some scaling of the sum of their covalent radii, i.e. d &lt; k(r cov i + r cov j ), where i and j are atomic indices.

        <p>Maintaining a high-throughput database inevitably requires a strategy for comparing similar structures and ranking them according to their relevance. In particular, this is necessary in order to identify different representatives of the same material e.g. resulting from independent relaxations, and thereby avoid duplicate entries and redundant computations. The C2DB strategy to this end involves a combination of structure clustering and Pareto analysis.Maintaining a high-throughput database inevitably requires a strategy for comparing similar structures and ranking them according to their relevance.

        <p>First, a single-linkage clustering algorithm is used to group materials with identical reduced chemical formula and 'similar' atomic configurations. To quantify configuration similarity a slightly modified version of 
            <rs type="software">PyMatGen</rs>'s [53] distance metric is employed where the cell volume normalisation is removed to make it applicable to 2D materials surrounded by vacuum. Roughly speaking, the metric measures the maximum distance an atom must be moved (in units of Å) in order to match the two atomic configurations. Two atomic configurations belong to the same cluster if their distance is below an empirically determined threshold of 0.3 Å.

        <p>At this point, the simplest strategy would be to remove all but the most stable compound within a cluster. However, this procedure would remove many high symmetry crystals for which a more stable distorted version exists. For example, the well known T-phase of MoS 2 would be removed in favour of the more stable T ′ -phase. This is undesired as highsymmetry structures, even if dynamically unstable at T = 0, may provide useful information and might in fact become stabilised at higher temperatures [54]. Therefore, the general strategy adopted for the C2DB, is to keep a material that is less stable than another material of the same cluster if it has fewer atoms in its primitive unit cell (and thus typically higher symmetry). Precisely, materials within a given cluster are kept only if they represent a defining point of the (N, ∆H)-Pareto front, where N is the number of atoms in the unit cell and ∆H is the heat of formation. A graphical illustration of the Pareto analysis is shown in figure 3 for the case of ReS 2 .At this point, the simplest strategy would be to remove all but the most stable compound within a cluster.

        <p>The original C2DB employed a crystal prototype classification scheme where specific materials were promoted to prototypes and used to label groups of materials with the same or very similar crystal structure. This approach was found to be difficult to maintain (as well as being non-transparent). Instead, materials are now classified according to their crystal type defined by the reduced stoichiometry, space group number, and the alphabetically sorted labels of the occupied Wyckoff positions. As an example, MoS 2 in the H-phase has the crystal type: AB2-187-bi.The original C2DB employed a crystal prototype classification scheme where specific materials were promoted to prototypes and used to label groups of materials with the same or very similar crystal structure.

        <p>In the original C2DB, the magnetic category was further subdivided into ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM). But since the simplest antiferromagnetically ordered state typically does not represent the true ground state, all material entries with an AFM state have been removed from the C2DB and replaced by the material in its FM state. Although the latter is less stable, it represents a more well defined state of the material. Crucially, the nearest neighbour exchange couplings for all magnetic materials have been included in the C2DB (see section 5.8). This enables a more detailed and realistic description of the magnetic order via the Heisenberg model. In particular, the FM state of a material is not expected to represent the true magnetic ground if the exchange coupling J &lt; 0.In the original C2DB, the magnetic category was further subdivided into ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM).

        <p>The heat of formation, ∆H, of a compound is defined as its energy per atom relative to its constituent elements in their standard states [55]. The thermodynamic stability of a compound is evaluated in terms of its energy above the convex hull, ∆H hull , which gives the energy of the material relative to other competing phases of the same chemical composition, including mixed phases [6], see figure 4 for an example. Clearly, ∆H hull depends on the pool of reference phases, which in turn defines the convex hull. The original C2DB employed a pool of reference phases comprised by 2807 elemental and binary bulk crystals from the convex hull of the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD) [55]. In the new version, this set has been extended by approximately 6783 ternary bulk compounds from the convex hull of OQMD, making a total of 9590 stable bulk reference compounds.The heat of formation, ∆H, of a compound is defined as its energy per atom relative to its constituent elements in their standard states [55].

        <p>As a simple indicator for the thermodynamic stability of a material, the C2DB employs three labels (low, medium, high) as defined in table 2. These indicators are unchanged from the original version of the C2DB. In particular, the criterion ∆H hull &lt; 0.2 eV atom -1 , defining the most stable category, was established based on an extensive analysis of 55 experimentally realised monolayer crystals [6]. It should be emphasised that the energies of both monolayers and bulk reference crystals are calculated with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) xc-functional [56]. This implies that some inaccuracies must be expected, in particular for materials with strongly localised d-electrons, e.g. certain transition metal oxides, and materials for which dispersive interactions are important, e.g. layered van der Waals crystals. The latter implies that the energy of a monolayer and its layered bulk parent (if such exists in the pool of references) will have the same energy.

        <p>Dynamically stable materials are situated at a local minimum of the potential energy surface and are thus stable to small structural perturbations. Structures resulting from DFT relaxations can end up in saddle point configurations because of imposed symmetry constraints or an insufficient number of atoms in the unit cell.Dynamically stable materials are situated at a local minimum of the potential energy surface and are thus stable to small structural perturbations.

        <p>In C2DB, the dynamical stability is assessed from the signs of the minimum eigenvalues of (1) the stiffness tensor (see section 3.1) and (2) the Γ-point Hessian matrix for a supercell containing 2 × 2 repetitions of the unit cell (the structure is not relaxed in the 2 × 2 supercell). If one of these minimal eigenvalues is negative the material is classified as dynamically unstable. This indicates that the energy can be reduced by displacing an atom and/or deforming the unit cell, respectively. The use of two categories for dynamical stability, i.e. stable/unstable, differs from the original version of the C2DB where an intermediate category was used for materials with negative but numerically small minimal eigenvalue of either the Hessian or stiffness tensors.In C2DB, the dynamical stability is assessed from the signs of the minimum eigenvalues of (1) the stiffness tensor (see section 3.1) and (2) the Γ-point Hessian matrix for a supercell containing 2 × 2 repetitions of the unit cell (the structure is not relaxed in the 2 × 2 supercell).

        <p>For all materials with a finite band gap the effective masses of electrons and holes are calculated for bands within 100 meV of the conduction band minimum and valence band maximum, respectively. The Hessian matrices at the band extrema (BE) are determined by fitting a second order polynomium to the PBE band structure including SOC, and the effective masses are obtained by subsequent diagonalisation of the Hessian. The main fitting-procedure is unaltered from the first version of C2DB, but two important improvements have been made.For all materials with a finite band gap the effective masses of electrons and holes are calculated for bands within 100 meV of the conduction band minimum and valence band maximum, respectively.

        <p>The first improvement consists in an additional kmesh refinement step for better localisation of the BE in the Brillouin zone. After the location of the BE has been estimated based on a uniformly sampled band structure with k-point density of 12 Å, another oneshot calculation is performed with a denser k-mesh around the estimated BE positions. This ensures a more accurate and robust determination of the location of the BE, which can be important in cases with a small but still significant spin-orbit splitting or when the band is very flat or non-quadratic around the BE. The second refinement step is the same as in the first version of C2DB, i.e. the band energies are calculated on a highly dense k-mesh in a small disc around the BE, and the Hessian is obtained by fitting the band energies in the range up to 1 meV from the BE.The first improvement consists in an additional kmesh refinement step for better localisation of the BE in the Brillouin zone.

        <p>The second improvement is the calculation of the mean absolute relative error (MARE) of the polynomial fit in a 25 meV range from the BE. The value of 25 meV corresponds to the thermal energy at room temperature and is thus the relevant energy scale for many applications. To make the MARE independent of the absolute position of the band we calculate the average energy of the band over the 25 meV and compare the deviation of the fit to this energy scale. The MARE provides a useful measure of the parabolicity of the energy bands and thus the validity of the effective mass approximation over this energy scale.The second improvement is the calculation of the mean absolute relative error (MARE) of the polynomial fit in a 25 meV range from the BE.

        <p>Figure 5 shows two examples of band structures with the effective mass fits and corresponding fit errors indicated. Additionally, the distribution of MARE for all the effective mass fits in the C2DB are presented. Most materials have an insignificant MARE, but a few materials have very large errors. Materials with a MARE above a few hundreds of percentages fall into two classes. For some materials the algorithm does not correctly find the position of the BE. An example is Ti 2 S 2 in the space group C2/m. For others, the fit and BE location are both correct, but the band flattens away from the BE which leads to a large MARE as is the case for Rh 2 Br 6 shown in the figure or Cl 2 Tl 2 in the space group P-1. In general a small MARE indicates a parabolic band while materials with large MARE should be handled on a case-bycase basis.Figure 5 shows two examples of band structures with the effective mass fits and corresponding fit errors indicated.

        <p>To facilitate a state-specific analysis of the PBE Kohn-Sham wave functions, an orbital projected band structure (PBS) is provided to complement the projected density of states (PDOS). In the PAW methodology, the all-electron wave functions are projected onto atomic orbitals inside the augmentation spheres centred at the position of each atom. The PBS resolves these atomic orbital contributions to the wave functions as a function of band and k-point whereas the PDOS resolves the atomic orbital character of the total density of states as a function of energy. The SOC is not included in the PBS or PDOS, as its effect is separately visualised by the spin-PBS also available in the C2DB.To facilitate a state-specific analysis of the PBE Kohn-Sham wave functions, an orbital projected band structure (PBS) is provided to complement the projected density of states (PDOS).

The details of these calculations can be found in the original C2DB paper [6]. A recent in-depth analysis of the 61.716 G 0 W 0 data points making up the QP band structures led to several important conclusions relevant for high-throughput G 0 W 0 calculations. In particular, it identified the linear QP approximation as a significant error source in standard G 0 W 0 calculations and proposed an extremely simple correction scheme (the empirical Z (empZ) scheme), that reduces this error by a factor of two on average.The C2DB contains G 0 W 0 quasiparticle (QP) band structures of 370 monolayers covering 14 different crystal structures and 52 chemical elements.

        <p>The empZ scheme divides the electronic states into two classes according to the size of the QP weight, Z. States with Z ∈ [0.5, 1.0] are classified as QP consistent (QP-c) while states with Z ̸ ∈ [0.5, 1.0] are classified as QP inconsistent (QP-ic). With this definition, QP-c states will have at least half of their spectral weight in the QP peak. The distribution of the 60.000+ Z-values is shown in figure 7. It turns out that the linear approximation to the self-energy, which is the gist of the QP approximation, introduces significantly larger errors for QP-ic states than for QP-c states. Consequently, the empZ method replaces the calculated Z of QP-ic states with the mean of the Z-distribution, Z 0 ≈ 0.75. This simple replacement reduces the average error of the linear approximation from 0.11 to 0.06 eV.The empZ scheme divides the electronic states into two classes according to the size of the QP weight, Z.

        <p>The class of TMDC monolayers of the type MX 2 (where M is the transition metal and X is a chalcogen) exhibits a large variety of interesting and unique properties and has been widely discussed in the literature [60]. Recent experiments have shown that it is not only possible to synthesise different materials by changing the metal M or the chalcogen X, but also by exchanging the X on one side of the layer by another chalcogen (or halogen) [61][62][63]. This results in a class of 2D materials known as MXY Janus monolayers with broken mirror symmetry and finite out-of-plane dipole moments. The prototypical MXY crystal structures are shown in figure 9 for the case of MoSSe and BiTeI, which have both been experimentally realised [61][62][63]. Adopting the nomenclature from the TMDCs, the crystal structures are denoted as H-or T-phase, depending on whether X and Y atoms are vertically aligned or displaced, respectively.The class of TMDC monolayers of the type MX 2 (where M is the transition metal and X is a chalcogen) exhibits a large variety of interesting and unique properties and has been widely discussed in the literature [60].

        <p>The Rashba effect is a momentum dependent splitting of the band energies of a 2D semiconductor in the vicinity of a band extremum arising due to the combined effect of spin-orbit interactions and a broken crystal symmetry in the direction perpendicular to the 2D plane.

The electric field of the Rashba model is approximately given by E 0 = ∆V vac /d, where ∆V vac is the shift in vacuum potential on the two sides of the layer (see left inset of figure 10) and d is the layer thickness. Assuming a similar thickness for all monolayers, the electric field is proportional to the potential shift. Not unexpected, the latter is found to correlate strongly with the difference in electronegativity of the X and Y atoms, see left panel of figure 10.Although the Rashba Hamiltonian is only meant as a qualitative model, it is of interest to test its validity on the Janus monolayers.

        <p>Figure 11 shows the distribution of energies above the convex hull for materials derived from parent structures in ICSD or COD as well as for the entire C2DB, which includes materials obtained from combinatorial lattice decoration as well. As expected, the materials derived from experimental bulk materials are situated rather close to the convex hull whereas those obtained from lattice decoration extend to energies far above the convex hull. It is also observed that a larger fraction of the experimentally derived materials are dynamically stable. There are, however, well known examples of van der Waals bonded structures where the monolayer undergoes a significant lattice distortion, which will manifest itself as a dynamical instability in the present context. For example, bulk MoS 2 exists in van der Waals bonded structures composed of either 2 H-MoS 2 or 1 T-MoS 2 layers, but a monolayer of the 1 T phase undergoes a structural deformation involving a doubling of the unit cell [69] and is thus categorised as dynamically unstable by the C2DB workflow.

As a first application the subset has been used to search for magnetic 2D materials, which resulted in a total of 85 ferromagnets and 61 anti-ferromagnets [70].</p>
        <p>The C2DB is concerned with the properties of covalently bonded monolayers (see discussion of dimensionality filtering in section 2.2). However, multilayer structures composed of two or more identical monolayers are equally interesting and often have properties that deviate from those of the monolayer. In fact, the synthesis of layered vdW structures with a controllable number of layers represents an interesting avenue for atomic-scale materials design. Several examples of novel phenomena emerging in layered vdW structures have been demonstrated including direct-indirect band gap transitions in MoS 2 [71,72], layer-parity selective Berry curvatures in few-layer WTe 2 [73], thickness-dependent magnetic order in CrI 3 [74,75], and emergent ferroelectricity in bilayer hBN [76].The C2DB is concerned with the properties of covalently bonded monolayers (see discussion of dimensionality filtering in section 2.2).

        <p>As a first step towards a systematic exploration of multilayer 2D structures, the C2DB has been used as basis for generating homobilayers in various stacking configurations and subsequently computing their properties following a modified version of the C2DB monolayer workflow. Specifically, the most stable monolayers (around 1000) are combined into bilayers by applying all possible transformations (unit cell preserving point group operations and translations) of one layer while keeping the other fixed. The candidate bilayers generated in this way are subject to a stability analysis, which evaluates the binding energy and optimal IL distance based on PBE-D3 [77] total energy calculations keeping the atoms of the monolayers fixed in their PBE relaxed geometry, see figures 12 and table 3. The calculated IL binding energies are generally in the range from a few to a hundred meV Å -2 and IL distances range from 1.5 to 3.8 Å. A scatter plot of preliminary binding energies and IL distances is shown in figure 13. The analysis of homobilayers provides an estimate of the energy required to peel a monolayer off a bulk structure. In particular, the binding energy for the most stable bilayer configuration provides a measure of the exfoliation energy of the monolayer. This key quantity is now available for all monolayers in the C2DB, see section 5.1.As a first step towards a systematic exploration of multilayer 2D structures, the C2DB has been used as basis for generating homobilayers in various stacking configurations and subsequently computing their properties following a modified version of the C2DB monolayer workflow.

        <p>The C2DB is concerned with the properties of 2D materials in their pristine crystalline form. However, as is well known the perfect crystal is an idealised model of real materials, which always contain defects in smaller or larger amounts depending on the intrinsic materials properties and growth conditions. Crystal defects often have a negative impact on physical properties, e.g. they lead to scattering and life time-reduction of charge carriers in semiconductors. However, there are also important situations where defects play a positive enabling role, e.g. in doping of semiconductors, as colour centres for photon emission [78,79] or as active sites in catalysis.The C2DB is concerned with the properties of 2D materials in their pristine crystalline form.

Next, Slater-Janak transition state theory is used to obtain the charge transition levels [82,83]. By combining these results, one obtains the formation energy of the defect in all possible charge states as a function of the Fermi level. An example of such a diagram is shown in figure 14 (b) for the case of the V C and C Si defects in monolayer CH 2 Si. For each defect and each charge state, the PBE single-particle energy level diagram is calculated to provide a qualitative overview of the electronic structure.

        <p>In general, excited electronic states can be modelled by solving the Kohn-Sham equations with non-Aufbau occupations. The excited-state solutions are saddle points of the Kohn-Sham energy functional, but common self-consistent field (SCF) approaches often struggle to find such solutions, especially when nearly degenerate states are involved. The calculation of excited states corresponding to transitions between localised states inside the band gap is therefore performed using an alternative method based on the direct optimisation (DO) of orbital rotations in combination with the maximum overlap method (MOM) [85]. This method ensures fast and robust convergence of the excited states, as compared to SCF. In figure 14 (d), the reorganisation energies for the ground and excited state, as well as the zero-phonon line (ZPL) energy are sketched. For the specific case of the Si vacancy in CH 2 Si, the DO-MOM method yields E ZPL = 3.84 eV, λ reorg gs = 0.11 eV and λ reorg exc = 0.16 eV. For systems with large electron-phonon coupling (i.e. Huang-Rhys factor &gt; 1) a one-dimensional approximation for displacements along the main phonon mode is used to produce the configuration coordinate diagram (see figure 14 (d)). In addition to the ZPL energies and reorganisation energies, the Huang-Rhys factors, photoluminescence spectrum from the 1D phonon model, hyperfine coupling and zero field splitting are calculated.In general, excited electronic states can be modelled by solving the Kohn-Sham equations with non-Aufbau occupations.

        <p>It is of interest to examine the relation between the Born charge and the Bader charge (see section 5.2). In materials with strong ionic bonds one would expect the charges to follow the atoms. On the other hand, in covalently bonded materials the hybridisation pattern and thus the charge distribution, depends on the atom positions in a complex way, and the idea of charges following the atom is expected to break down. In agreement with this idea, the (in-plane) Born charges in the strongly ionic hexagonal hBN (± 2.71e for B and N, respectively) are in good agreement with the calculated Bader charges (± 3.0e). In contrast, (the in-plane) Born charges in MoS 2 (-1.08e and 0.54e for Mo and S, respectively) deviate significantly from the Bader charges (1.22e and -0.61e for Mo and S, respectively). In fact, the values disagree even on the sign of the charges underlining the nonintuitive nature of the Born charges in covalently bonded materials.It is of interest to examine the relation between the Born charge and the Bader charge (see section 5.2).

        <p>Note that the out-of-plane Born charges never match the Bader charges, even for strongly ionic insulators, and are consistently smaller in value than the in-plane components. The smaller out-of-plane values are consistent with the generally smaller out-ofplane polarisability of 2D materials (for both electronic and phonon contributions) and agrees with the intuitive expectation that it is more difficult to polarise a 2D material in the out-of-plane direction as compared to the in-plane direction.Note that the out-of-plane Born charges never match the Bader charges, even for strongly ionic insulators, and are consistently smaller in value than the in-plane components.

The ionicity is thus a measure of the tendency of an atom to donate/accept charge relative to the average tendency of atoms in the material. It is clear from figure 16 that there is a larger propensity for the Born and Bader charges to match in materials with higher ionicity.Figure 16 shows the average of the diagonal of the Born charge tensor, Tr(Z a )/3, plotted against the Bader charges for all 585 materials in the C2DB for which the Born charges have been computed.

It determines the number of chiral edge states on any edge of the material. For any non-magnetic material the Chern number vanishes due to time-reversal symmetry.

In fact, AFM states often have lower energy than the FM one, but in general it is non-trivial to obtain the true magnetic ground state. We have chosen to focus on the FM state due to its simplicity and because its atomic structure and stability are often very similar to those of other magnetic states.

More interestingly, the strength of the quadratic response seems to a very good approximation to be given by a universal constant times the linear susceptibility to the power of three (ignoring polarisation indices), i.e. χ (2) (0, 0) ≈ Aχ (1)</p>

        <p>In recent years, material scientists have shown great interest in exploiting the use of machine learning (ML) techniques for predicting materials properties and guiding the search for new materials. ML is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems can use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions but instead relying on patterns and inference. Within the domain of materials science, one of the most frequent problems is the mapping from atomic configuration to material property, which can be used e.g. to screen large material spaces in search of optimal candidates for specific applications [123,124]. In the ML literature, the mathematical representation of the input observations is often referred to as a fingerprint. Any fingerprint must satisfy a number of general requirements [125]. In particular, a fingerprint must be: Several types of atomic-level materials fingerprints have been proposed in the literature, including general purpose fingerprints based on atomistic properties [126,127] possibly encoding information about the atomic structure, i.e. atomic positions [125,128,129], and specialised fingerprints tailored for specific applications (materials/properties) [130,131].In recent years, material scientists have shown great interest in exploiting the use of machine learning (ML) techniques for predicting materials properties and guiding the search for new materials.

        <p>The aim of this section is to demonstrate how the C2DB may be utilised for ML-based prediction of general materials properties. Moreover, the study serves to illustrate the important role of the fingerprint for such problems. The 2D materials are represented using three different fingerprints: two popular structural fingerprints and a more advanced fingerprint that encodes information about the electronic structure via the PDOS. The target properties include the HSE06 band gap, the PBE heat of formation (∆H), the exciton binding energy (E B ) obtained from the many-body BSE, the in-plane static polarisability calculated in the RPA averaged over the x and y polarisation directions (⟨α i ⟩), and the in-plane Voigt modulus (⟨C ii ⟩) defined as 1 4 (C 11 + C 22 + 2C 12 ), where C ij is a component of the elastic stiffness tensor in Mandel notation.The aim of this section is to demonstrate how the C2DB may be utilised for ML-based prediction of general materials properties.

        <p>To introduce the data, figure 24 shows pair-plots of the dual-property relations of these properties. The plots in the diagonal show the single-property histograms, whereas the off-diagonals show dual-property scatter plots below the diagonal and histograms above the diagonal. Clearly, there are only weak correlations between most of the properties, with the largest degree of correlation observed between the HSE06 gap and exciton binding energy. The lack of strong correlations motivates the use of ML for predicting the properties.To introduce the data, figure 24 shows pair-plots of the dual-property relations of these properties.

        <p>The prediction models are build using the Ewald sum matrix and many-body tensor representation (MBTR) as structural fingerprints.

        <p>where n runs over all eigenstates of the system. Since this fingerprint requires a DFT-PBE calculation to be performed, additional features derivable from the DFT calculation can be added to the fingerprint. In this study, the PDOS fingerprint is amended by the PBE band gap. The latter can in principle be extracted from the PDOS, but its explicit inclusion has been found to improve the performance of the model. A Gaussian process regression using a simple Gaussian kernel with a noise component is used as learning algorithm. The models are trained using 5fold cross validation on a training set consisting of 80% of the materials with the remaining 20% held aside as test data. Prior to training the model, the input space is reduced to 50 features using principal component analysis (PCA). This step is necessary to reduce the huge number of features in the MBTR fingerprint to a manageable size. Although this is not required for the Ewald and PDOS fingerprints, we perform the same feature reduction in all cases. The optimal number of features depends on the choice of fingerprint, target property and learning algorithm, but for consistency 50 PCA components are used for all fingerprints and properties in this study.where n runs over all eigenstates of the system.

        <p>Figure 25 shows the prediction scores obtained for the five properties using the three different fingerprints. The employed prediction score is the mean absolute error of the test set normalised by the standard deviation of the property values (standard deviations are annotated in the diagonal plots in figure 24). In general, the PDOS fingerprint outperforms the structural fingerprints. The difference between prediction scores is smallest for the static polarisability ⟨α i ⟩ and largest for the HSE06 gap. It should be stressed that although the evaluation of the PBE-PDOS fingerprint is significantly more time consuming than the evaluation of the structural fingerprints, it is still much faster than the evaluation of all the target properties. Moreover, structural fingerprints require the atomic structure, which in turns requires a DFT structure optimisation (unless the structure is available by other means).Figure 25 shows the prediction scores obtained for the five properties using the three different fingerprints.

        <p>The HSE06 band gap shows the largest sensitivity to the employed fingerprint. To elaborate on the HSE06 results, figure 26 shows the band gap predicted using each of the three different fingerprints plotted against the true band gap. The mean absolute errors on the test set is 0.95 and 0.74 eV for Ewald and MBTR fingerprints, respectively, while the PDOS significantly outperforms the other fingerprints with a test MAE of only 0.21 eV. This improvement in prediction accuracy is partly due to the presence of the PBE gap in the PDOS fingerprint. However, our analysis shows that the pure PDOS fingerprint without the PBE gap still outperforms the structural fingerprints. Using only the PBE gap as feature results in a test MAE of 0.28 eV.The HSE06 band gap shows the largest sensitivity to the employed fingerprint.

        <p>The current results show that the precision of MLbased predictions are highly dependent on the type of target property and the chosen material representation. For some properties, the mapping between atomic structure and property is easier to learn while others might require more/deeper information, e.g. in terms of electronic structure fingerprints. Our results clearly demonstrate the potential of encoding electronic structure information into the material fingerprint, and we anticipate more work on this relevant and exciting topic in the future.The current results show that the precision of MLbased predictions are highly dependent on the type of target property and the chosen material representation.

        <p>The C2DB has been produced using the ASR in combination with the GPAW electronic structure code and the 
            <rs type="software">MyQueue</rs> task and workflow scheduling system. The ASR is a newly developed Python-based framework designed for high-throughput materials computations. The highly flexible and modular nature of the ASR and its strong coupling to the well established community-driven ASE project, makes it a versatile framework for both high-and lowthroughput materials simulation projects. The ASR and the C2DB-ASR workflow are distributed as open source code. A detailed documentation of the ASR will be published elsewhere.
