        <p>Magnetic skyrmions are topological spin textures that are stabilized in various types of magnets by different kinds of interactions. Non-centrosymmetric bulk magnets with either chiral, polar, or D 2d symmetry provide a good arena to study the topological spin structures and emergent electromagnetic responses arising from them [1,2]. In these magnets without inversion symmetry, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) gradually twists the otherwise ferromagnetic spin arrangement, thus giving rise to helimagnetic structure in zero field as well as skyrmions in a certain range of magnetic field. Skyrmions cannot be connected to helical structure through continuous deformation, therefore they are topologically protected from external perturbations and hence appropriate for robust information carriers. Thus far, three different types of skyrmions as schematically shown in figure 1 have been observed experimentally, which were theoretically predicted [3].Magnetic skyrmions are topological spin textures that are stabilized in various types of magnets by different kinds of interactions.

        <p>The first category is a Bloch-type skyrmion in chiral magnets, where the spins are lying within the tangential plane, as shown in figure 1(a). The A-phase in MnSi with B20-type chiral structure, which had been known for years as a mysterious phase, was revealed to be a skyrmion crystal, which is described as a superposition of three screw-type helices, by small angle neutron scattering (SANS) [4]. Then, isolated skyrmions in addition to the skyrmion-lattice form were observed for B20 compounds in real space by Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) technique [5]. In 2012, an insulating and multiferroic Cu 2 OSeO 3 was identified to host skyrmions [6]. In 2015, β-Mn type Co-Zn-Mn alloy was discovered to exhibit skyrmions at and above room temperature, and the metastable skyrmion state was observed at zero magnetic field and room temperature [7], as displayed in figure 2.The first category is a Bloch-type skyrmion in chiral magnets, where the spins are lying within the tangential plane, as shown in figure 1(a).

        <p>The third family is an antiskyrmion shown in figure 1(c), which was discovered in Heusler compounds with D 2d crystal symmetry in 2017 by using LTEM [9]. Application of magnetic fields stabilizes the antiskyrmion lattice over a wide range of temperature including room temperature. Crosssections of an antiskyrmion are either screw-type helix or cycloidal one, depending on the azimuthal direction.The third family is an antiskyrmion shown in figure 1(c), which was discovered in Heusler compounds with D 2d crystal symmetry in 2017 by using LTEM [9].

        <p>As overviewed above, some materials that exhibit (anti)skyrmions above room temperature have been found, but continued efforts to expand the horizon of such materials should be necessary to understand the fundamental physics of the skyrmions as well as to achieve their applications in practical devices.

In general, transition temperature T c and the size of a skyrmion are proportional to J and J/D, respectively, where J and D denote exchange interaction and DMI.

        <p>Increasing the (meta)stability of a skyrmion. As exemplified in the quintessential compound MnSi [4], skyrmions can form only in a narrow phase space in a temperature-field plane in many cases. For the applications of skrymions, the stability (or metastability) should be enhanced so that the skyrmions persist in a wider phase space. The (meta)stability of the skyrmions has to be studied both experimentally and theoretically in more detail.Increasing the (meta)stability of a skyrmion.

        <p>Three-dimensional nature of a skyrmion. A single skyrmion is often considered as a rigid, tube-like object. In reality, however, a skyrmion is better considered as a flexible string that can dynamically deform under the influence of pinning sites. Also, in the destruction process of a skyrmion, creation of monopole-antimonopole pair, or coalescence between two skyrmion strings are important [10]. Another interesting issue is propagation dynamics of spin excitations along skyrmion strings and its directional non-reciprocity. These issues related to the three-dimensional nature of the skyrmion string are to be clarified both experimentally and theoretically.Three-dimensional nature of a skyrmion.

        <p>Controlling skyrmions. Creation, transportation, detection, and annihilation of skyrmions are definitely necessary. As for the creation, current injections, application of stress, irradiation of pulsed light have been reported to successfully stabilize the skyrmions. It has been also known [11] that skyrmions are driven by much lower current density than those needed for ferromagnetic domain wall motion. Future challenge is to control the motion of isolated skyrmions individually, and to keep the threshold current-density low while attaining the high metastability, which may show a trade-off relation.Controlling skyrmions.

        <p>Since the discovery of skyrmions in B20-type compounds, many advances have been achieved thus far, and also will be expected in the near future, to meet the challenges described in the previous section.Since the discovery of skyrmions in B20-type compounds, many advances have been achieved thus far, and also will be expected in the near future, to meet the challenges described in the previous section.</p>
        <p>(a) Recently, theoretical prescription to calculate D value of metallic magnets, which depends sensitively on the band filling, has been established on the basis of first-principles calculation of band structure [12]. These advances allow us to design the magnets with high T c and large value of D. (b) Another skyrmion phase disconnected from the conventional phase just below T c has recently been identified at low temperatures in Cu 2 OSeO 3 and Co 7 Zn 7 Mn 6 [13,14], as disccused in section 3. Metastability of quenched skyrmion state has been investigated with a focus on the interplay between topological protection and thermal agitation. Some pump-and-probe or stroboscopic techniques, including the SANS, have been developed to detect dynamical behavior of the skyrmion-lattice formation/destruction process. Recent experiments have proved that metastability depends on the quenched randomness and the size of a skyrmion, but this should be investigated in more detail. (c) Monopole-antimonopole structure as well as coalescence of skyrmions have been discussed from magnetic force microscopy measurement and theoretical consideration [10]. These phenomena are also observed for a thin-plate sample by LTEM with in-plane field configuration. Emergent electric field in dynamically bending skyrmion strings as well as non-reciprocal transport along the skyrmion string have been discussed recently. (d) Creation, transportation, and annihilation of skyrmions have recently been observed with various techniques, such as SANS and LTEM for bulk skyrmions [11,15], and scanning transmission x-ray microscopy exploiting x-ray magnetic circular dichroism for interfacial skrmions [16]. These studies have revealed the dynamic response of skyrmions to the current. Skyrmions in B20-type compounds were known to be driven by low current density as compared with current-driven ferromagnetic domain wall motion [11], and recently current drive of skyrmions have been successfully demonstrated for the Co-Zn-Mn alloy at room temperature. Imaging experiments with further improved spatial and time resolution will provide further detailed information on the dynamical features of skyrmoions.

        <p>Current research on skyrmions is mostly focused on magnets with chiral crystal lattices and heterostructures with inversion symmetry broken at interfaces of magnetic layers. At the same time, non-trivial skyrmion topology that gives rise to new phenomena, such as the topological and skyrmion Hall effects, is unrelated to lattice chirality. Recent theoretical studies showed that skyrmion crystals and isolated skyrmions can be stabilized by competing Heisenberg exchange interactions in Mott insulators with centrosymmetric lattices [18][19][20] as well as by long-ranged interactions mediated by conduction electrons in itinerant magnets [21]. These magnetically frustrated materials with achiral lattices are interesting because of additional collective degrees of freedom which give rise to a larger variety of topological magnetic states and more complex collective dynamics. Heisenberg exchange interactions do not select the spin rotation plane, which leads to an additional skyrmion zero mode, helicity, as there is no energy cost associated with the rotation of spins around the skyrmion symmetry axis (see figure 3(a)). Skyrmions with opposite helicities attract each other at short distances and form stable topological defects with higher topological charges (see figure 3(c)) [19,22]. The exchange energy of the skyrmion described by a classical spin model does not change under the sign reversal of an in-plane spin component, which reverses the sign of vorticity, describing the winding of spins around the skyrmion center, and the sign of the skyrmion topological charge, Q. Arbitrary vorticity allows for simultaneous presence of skyrmions and antiskyrmions in easy-axis magnets (see figures 3(b) and (d)) and vortex-antivortex pairs (bi-merons) in easy-plane magnets (see figure 4(a)) [22]. Like skyrmions, bi-merons have topological charge Q = ± 1 equally divided between the vortex and antivortex carrying half-integer charges (see figure 4(b)).Current research on skyrmions is mostly focused on magnets with chiral crystal lattices and heterostructures with inversion symmetry broken at interfaces of magnetic layers.

        <p>Non-collinear spin orders can spontaneously break inversion symmetry and induce an electric polarization. Skyrmion with vorticity +1 can have a net out-of-plane electric dipole moment that depends on skyrmion helicity, while the magnetic vortex has an electric charge. The magnetoelectric coupling allows for the electric-field control of topological defects in magnetic Mott insulators. In addition, the size of skyrmions stabilized by exchange interactions can be as small as a few lattice constants, which can be of interest for high-density magnetic memory applications.Non-collinear spin orders can spontaneously break inversion symmetry and induce an electric polarization.

        <p>Magnetically frustrated Mott insulators hosting skyrmion crystals are yet to be found. They have to satisfy a number of criteria, e.g. a high-symmetry axis that would allow them to accommodate multiply-periodic states. Furthermore, the mechanism for stabilization of skyrmion crystals in an applied magnetic field, which works in both chiral and achiral magnets, requires modulated ferromagnetic orders, whereas most frustrated magnets show antiferromagnetic (AFM) spiral states. For example, incommensurate spin spirals inducing an electric polarization have been found in dihalides, such as NiBr 2 and Col 2 , with stacked triangular lattices of magnetic ions [24]. Even a weak AFM coupling between neighboring magnetic layers can suppress the skyrmion crystal state [25]. One way to get around this problem would be to reduce thickness of these van der Waals magnets down to just one layer [26]. At the same time, stability requirements for isolated skyrmions and bi-merons in antiferromagnets are less stringent -they can be stabilized by an easy-axis anisotropy in zero field. Non-collinear antiferromagnetic spin textures give rise to polar displacements of ions and induce a local electric polarization that can be used for electric manipulation of skyrmions.Magnetically frustrated Mott insulators hosting skyrmion crystals are yet to be found.

        <p>Static and dynamics properties of a rich variety of unconventional magnetic orders and topological spin textures in frustrated systems, such as hopfions and magnetic hedgehogs (Bloch points), still have to be explored. Hedgehog-antihedgehog arrays have been recently observed in SrFeO 3 -a metal with the cubic perovskite structure which at T N ~130 K undergoes an antiferromagnetic phase transition ascribed to the onset of a helical spiral order. Later transport and neutron measurements revealed more ordered phases with several coexisting spirals. The four-spiral state is a hedgehog-antihedgehog lattice that under an applied magnetic field shows the THE [27]. It is not clear, however, whether itinerant magnets can support stable isolated magnetic defects.Static and dynamics properties of a rich variety of unconventional magnetic orders and topological spin textures in frustrated systems, such as hopfions and magnetic hedgehogs (Bloch points), still have to be explored.

        <p>Helicity gives rise to a new low-energy branch of magnetic excitations in skyrmion crystals and a new collective zero mode of isolated skyrmions and antiskyrmions. Effects of this additional degree of freedom on heat transport in frustrated magnets, such as the topological magnon Hall and spin Seebeck effects, have to be studied theoretically and experimentally. The coupling between helicity and translational modes, resulting, for example, from the dependence of skyrmion-(anti)skyrmion interactions on both positions and helicities of the topological defects [19], gives rise to rich and largely unexplored skyrmion dynamics, which can be excited by the spin-Hall torque, electromagnetic fields and electric currents.Helicity gives rise to a new low-energy branch of magnetic excitations in skyrmion crystals and a new collective zero mode of isolated skyrmions and antiskyrmions.

        <p>Magnetic frustration is very sensitive to deformations of crystal lattice, band filling and electronic configurations of magnetic ions. Therefore, the search for new skyrmion materials will require a tuning of materials parameters, e.g. by pressure and chemical substitutions which affect interactions between spins and magnetic anisotropy. Finding frustrated magnets with a high transition temperature and large magneticallyinduced electric polarization is a challenge. The search for such materials will benefit from first-principles calculations of competing exchange interactions. Ab initio calculation of magnetoelectric properties of non-coplanar spin textures, such as skyrmions, is an interesting problem.Magnetic frustration is very sensitive to deformations of crystal lattice, band filling and electronic configurations of magnetic ions.

        <p>It is rather challenging to understand the nature of complex multiply-periodic magnetic states, such as the hedgehogantihedgehog array, on the basis of neutron scattering alone.

        <p>The emergence of topological spin textures from magnetic frustration is a new paradigm in the search for skyrmion materials. Experimental and theoretical study of topological magnetic states in frustrated magnets is still in its infancy. Mott insulators with competing exchange interactions as well as itinerant magnets can host tiny skyrmions with versatile physical properties and complex dynamics. The reversible electric dipole moment of skyrmions in Mott insulators can be controlled with an applied electric field, which provides a new route to skyrmion-based electronics with low energy losses and high density of information storage.The emergence of topological spin textures from magnetic frustration is a new paradigm in the search for skyrmion materials.

        <p>Building on a large body of evidence that establishes skyrmion lattice order as a generic thermodynamic ground state at high temperatures, numerous studies have shown that skyrmion lattices readily fall out of thermal equilibrium under field-cooling. This was observed initially in Fe 1 -x Co x Si, MnSi under pressure as well as Co 8 Zn 8 Mn 4 [30][31][32]. While both, Fe 1 -x Co x Si and Co 8 Zn 8 Mn 4 , are subject to strong disorder, extremely fast thermal quenches may be used in pure MnSi at ambient conditions [33]. However, despite being thermodynamically metastable, thermally quenched skyrmion lattices display exceptional stability in the low temperature limit, namely: (i) the skyrmion lattice survives deep into the fieldpolarized state beyond the conical phase (see figure 5 As a corollary of these observations the energy of the metastable skyrmion lattice differs only slightly from the true thermodynamic ground states, while the energy barriers are large. Using magnetic force microscopy this was exploited in Fe 1 -x Co x Si to obtain information on the nature of the topological unwinding of skyrmions [10]. For thin bulk samples of Fe 1 -x Co x Si, which feature an extended parameter range of the skyrmion lattice phase in thermal equilibrium [5], limitations of the topological protection due to entropy compensation were identified [34]. Moreover, the formation of metastable skyrmion lattice order under field-cooling has also been used, for instance, to determine the size of the intrinsic topological Hall signal [31,35]. As metastable skyrmion configurations feature long life-times their use in non-volatile memory and other applications has been advertised.

        <p>Several studies have also addressed skyrmions and skyrmionic spin structures in systems that are strongly driven out of equilibrium by means of a non-thermal stimulus. Important examples include the exceptionally strong coupling of spin currents to skyrmion lattices, which induce skyrmion lattice flow at ultra-small current densities [11,17,37]. In atomically thin films, it has been argued that the effects of spin currents permit to read and write skyrmions [38]. Further, the creation of skyrmions with current pulses has also been employed in micro-structured films, where the nucleation process is attributed to the details of geometric constraints [39]. On a different note, the creation of specific magnon excitations may also be used to drive skyrmion systems out of equilibrium.

        <p>Topological protection of the skyrmion state prevents a continuous transformation of the chiral spin texture, e.g. into the uniform magnetic state and vice versa. To unwind this extraordinarily stable state -a stability which in principle can also be attributed to isolated metastable skyrmions outside the stability pocket in the phase diagram -topological defects such as Bloch points [58] or so-called hedgehogs [10] need to be introduced.

        <p>Concerning the first point several approaches based on the interplay between a dc current or current pulses and the magnetic energy landscape exist. It has been realized early on that sykrmions may be created at positions where locally the internal stability phase diagram is altered [57,39,54,55] due to the combined action of the current-induced spintransfer torque acting on the local magnetization and a magnetic energy lansdscape which varies locally on a length scale comparable to the skyrmion size [57]. The local change of the energy landscape may be controlled by the magneto-static energy [39] or by local engineering of the magnetic anisotropy, Dzyloshinskii-Moriya interaction or saturation magnetization [57]. For technologically desired small skyrmion sizes below 50 nm it is thus technical challenging to realize skyrmion creation on demand.Concerning the first point several approaches based on the interplay between a dc current or current pulses and the magnetic energy landscape exist.

        <p>The full magnon spectrum is, however, much richer. When spin waves propagate across the periodic texture of magnetic skyrmion crystals, they experience Bragg scattering that leads to a backfolding of their dispersion resulting in a magnon band structure. The extension of the corresponding Brillouin zone, 2π/a SkX , is determined by the lattice constant of the skyrmion crystal a SkX , that is typically on the order of several tens of nanometers. This backfolding leads to various spinwave modes at the Γ-point of the Brillouin zone but, due to selection rules, only three of them can be excited by magnetic resonance. The other modes with finite frequencies are associated with higher magnetic multipole excitations, see figure 7.The full magnon spectrum is, however, much richer.

Whereas the skyrmions found in chiral magnets are mainly stabilized by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and are relatively stiff with only a few internal modes [40], the properties of so-called skyrmion bubbles, often found in magnetic multilayers, are dominated by dipolar interactions leading to larger skyrmion sizes with more internal modes [65,66]. At high energies, the spin wave scattering off single skyrmions is governed by an emergent electrodynamics that is directly linked to the non-trivial topology of skyrmions, see section 6. It results in a characteristic skew scattering that can give rise to a topological magnon Hall effect [37]. For skyrmion crystals, the emergent electrodynamics leads to magnon Landau levels leading to finite Chern numbers of certain magnon bands [40,67]. As a result, skyrmion crystals with sufficiently low Gilbert damping should be accompanied with topologically protected magnon edge states.Isolated single skyrmions also possess resonances.

Within the Thiele approach, the same parameter determines the damping of skyrmions. It is far from obvious under which conditions and for which materials this approach is correct. For example, if one considers a model system where the total magnetization S z is exactly conserved, such that α = 0, there will still be skyrmion friction arising, e.g. from the spin-conserving scattering of thermally excited magnons or electrons. For example, a moving skyrmion induces an emergent electric field [17] which accelerates thermal magnons or electrons and transfers energy from the skyrmion to its environment. Note that the majority of all skyrmion experiments are performed in a regime where temperature is much larger than the magnon gap. Especially in insulators with small Gilbert damping α one can expect that skyrmion friction is not dominated by Gilbert damping. Comparing experiments measuring spin precession in the ferromagnetic state (and thereby α) and skyrmion damping (e.g. by tracking skyrmion trajectories) separately will allow to investigate quantitatively this question.While the value of the first term, the gyrocoupling in equation ( 5) is largely fixed by topology and the average magnetization, it is much less clear, which physical processes can be responsible for the damping Γ.

        <p>An issue which is, however, more important are the forces on the right-hand side of equation ( 5). On the one hand, these are forces used to manipulate the skyrmion, arising from currents, field gradients or from nanostructuring of the sample, e.g. in a wire geometry. On the other hand, this also includes forces which are less under experimental control as they arise from defects or skyrmion-skyrmion interactions. Defects result in skyrmion pinning [17,88,89], and strongly affect skyrmion motion and also skyrmion creation and destruction. As skyrmions are very smooth topological textures, pinning forces from local defects are often suppressed but such a mechanism does not exist for defects which have a length scale similar to the skyrmion size, arising, e.g. from surface roughness of magnetic layers.An issue which is, however, more important are the forces on the right-hand side of equation ( 5).

        <p>A widely discussed question concerns the effective mass of the skyrmion arising when the corrections δM to the rigid skyrmion picture are taken into account. The effective skyrmion mass M s leads to an inertial force of the form M s d 2 R dt 2 and can be used to parametrize corrections to equation (5). There is a large disagreement in the current literature on the value of the effective skyrmion mass. Some recent publications claim that the mass is exactly zero [90], others find large intertial effects both in experiments and in simulations of skyrmion dynamics [91]. As has been shown in reference [92], there is not a single effective mass, but different apparent effective masses should be considered depending on the type of force which is applied. As the mass ultimately arises from deformations of the moving skyrmion, see figure 10, one obtains different values whether one considers skyrmions in nanostructures [91,93], driven by field gradients, or driven by spin-torques. For the response to some hypothetical force which does not deform the skyrmion, the effective mass vanishes, while large values scaling with the skyrmion size are obtained when the response to thermal fluctuations [92] is considered, arguably the most generic way to define an effective mass. From a more general point of view, one should Figure 10. When a force is applied to a skyrmion, internal degrees of freedom are excited. These internal excitations lead to retardation effects which can be described as an effective mass of the skyrmion. Different forces lead to different types of deformations and therefore to different values of the effective mass.

        <p>An effective description of a skyrmion in terms of its coordinate ignores the role of internal degrees of freedom of the skyrmion. These internal degrees of freedom can, however, be used to manipulate the skyrmion and often become important under 'extreme conditions', when the skyrmion is subject to strong forces, or is close to an instability. In these cases, one should generalize the Thiele approach to include extra degrees of freedom, e.g. [94]. In frustrated magnets with weak dipolar or spin-orbit interaction, for example, the motion of skyrmions can excite the internal precession of spins which in turn affects the skyrmion coordinate [94]. Here a promising direction is to actively use the internal excitations to control the skymion motion. An oscillating magnetic field can, for example, induce via a ratchet-like mechanism a form which leads to a motion of skyrmions [95,96]. Another opportunity is provided by the recent observation of skyrmions in inversion symmetric systems [97]. In the presence of inversion symmetry, skyrmions with opposite helicity, i.e. left-handed and right-handed skyrmions are exactly degenerate and one can use this internal degree to store information [18,19]. For ultrasmall skyrmions in magnetic insulators also quantum effects may become important and it is possible to entangle the motional degree of freedom with internal degrees of freedom [29]. Especially interesting in this context is the quantum tunneling of skyrmi-ons to antiskyrmions in frustrated magnets which can delocalize quantum skyrmions [29].An effective description of a skyrmion in terms of its coordinate ignores the role of internal degrees of freedom of the skyrmion.

        <p>To unravel the forces governing skyrmion dynamics is a challenge which can only be met by careful experiments and their comparison with theory. Here the main difficulty will be to distinguish between intrinsic forces (e.g. due to scattering from thermal magnons) and extrinsic forces (arising, e.g. from defects). Ideally, the question can be studied in ultraclean systems with single skyrmions whose positions can be measured, e.g. by electron microscopy or other techniques to image skyrmions. Equally important are systematic experimental and theoretical studies on the pinning of skyrmions both by single defects and a finite density of defects. In both cases the effects of thermal fluctuations will be important. On the theoretical side, it will be interesting to use field-theoretical techniques to investigate which thermal effects can and which cannot be described by numerical simulations of stochastic LLG equations. A classical description may fail in situations where classical physics predicts that modes with frequencies larger than k B T/ℏ contribute (which, for example, is the case for the thermal blackbody radiation).To unravel the forces governing skyrmion dynamics is a challenge which can only be met by careful experiments and their comparison with theory.

The current driven skyrmion dynamics for example depends on the current induced spin-orbit torque (SOT) and spin transfer torque (STT) as well as the spin Hall effect (SHE). Efficient and reliable schemes to calculate the linear response quantities describing these and related phenomena as for example the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) for suitable reference systems are available nowadays.

        <p>In spite of the progress made concerning the first-principles calculation of the various parameters needed for subsequent statistical simulations there are still a number of limitations to be removed. Concerning the exchange coupling including the DMI it was already demonstrated by various authors that it is in general important to go beyond the standard bilinear pair interaction expansion that is often restricted to nearest neighbors to obtain accurate results for skyrmionic systems. Moreover, the extension of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian by adding higher-order multi-spin interaction terms can lead to new physics, e.g. to the stabilization of a skyrmion lattice without an external magnetic field [102]. As these parameters are always calculated for a reference system-often in a ferromagnetic configuration-it is important to have the reference system as close as possible to the situation of the real skyrmionic system of interest.

        <p>The magnetic bits typically form one magnetic electrode of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) that is composed of two magnetic electrodes separated by an ultra-thin tunneling barrier. The resistance of such an MTJ depends on the relative magnetic orientations of the electrodes, whether the magnetizations are parallel or anti-parallel. The development of MRAM based on magnetic tunnel junctions was made possible by the discovery of very large room temperature tunneling magnetoresistance in devices that have body centered cubic CoFe or CoFeB electrodes separated by magnesium oxide (MgO) tunnel barriers [112] and the concept of spin transfer torque that enables switching of the state of the magnetic elements by using spin angular momentum derived torques from current passed through the elements [113]. Although the original concept of MRAM using MTJs dates from 1995 when 
            <rs type="software">DARPA</rs> funded a program to prove the possibility of such a concept and that the fundamental principle was realized in 1999 [111], it has taken more than twenty years to realize MRAM with necessary properties for widespread applications beyond niche applications for which small scale MRAM chips with tiny capacities were earlier developed.

The potential is for a solid-state non-volatile memory device that could have storage capacities comparable to magnetic disk drives but that would have much greater performance, use much less energy and that would be much more compact.</p>
        <p>The essential physics that underlies Racetrack Memory is that a series of magnetic domain walls can be moved together in the same direction along the racetrack when current is applied. The first demonstration of this principle in 2008 [117] used current that was spin-polarized from spin-dependent scattering within the magnetic material of the racetrack itself. The maximum velocity of the domain walls was 100 m s -1 and was limited by the maximum current density that did not result in significant heating of the nanowire. Similar velocities from such a volume spin transfer torque (STT) mechanism were later found in nanowires formed from magnetic multilayers of ultra-thin Co and Ni layers that exhibit perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) so that the domain wall (DW) width can be reduced to just a few nanometers, thereby achieving high storage density.The essential physics that underlies Racetrack Memory is that a series of magnetic domain walls can be moved together in the same direction along the racetrack when current is applied.

        <p>Over the past 5 years or so, there have been some extraordinary advances in the physics of the current induced motion of PMA domain walls (DWs) via spin-orbit derived torques. Two essential ingredients are the formation of chiral Néel domain walls via an interface Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Exchange Interaction (DMI) and spin currents generated by the spin Hall effect in metallic layers adjacent to the magnetic layers that form the racetrack. The spin-orbit torques are much more efficient than volume STT torques and allow for chiral DWs to be moved at several hundred m s -1 [118], as shown in figure 12(a). The final major development was the discovery of a giant exchange torque in synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) racetracks [119], as shown in figure 12(b). Such SAF structures (or, also termed artificial antiferromagnets,) solve a major problem that plagues nearly all magnetic nano-devices, namely the magnetostatic fields that they generate [110]. In addition to overcoming interactions between DWs within and between racetracks, SAF racetracks, the antiferromagnetic coupling (AF) exchange field within the SAF also gives rise to a new mechanism to drive the domain walls so that DW velocities of more than 1 km/s are possible [119]. Research into the current induced motion of domain walls, especially with regard to its use in racetrack memory, has a history dating back more than a decade and is now well established. Thus, Racetrack Momory has now entered into the industrial application phase, where important matters especially relating to scaling to tiny dimensions, reliability and reproducibility of DW motion, and thermal stability of DWs will be explored. The nearly identical comcept of using skyrmions or anti-skyrmions as the memory-storage element in racetracks means that progress on such concept can be accelerated.Over the past 5 years or so, there have been some extraordinary advances in the physics of the current induced motion of PMA domain walls (DWs) via spin-orbit derived torques.

        <p>There have been several proposals to replace the DWs in a racetrack with skyrmions or other related objects, some of which are discussed elsewhere in this review. For example, the current induced motion of individual skyrmions has been demonstrated in racetracks that are nearly identical in structure to those discussed above with regard to chiral domain walls. A typical structure is an ultra-thin CoFeB ferromagnetic layer coupled to a heavy metal such as Pt or W: the interface generates a DMI as well as providing PMA, as shown in figure 12(c). The interfacial nature means that the magnetic layer must be Yellow indicates a ferromagnetic layer with PMA. Green layer indicates Ru spacer layer which gives rise to an RKKY interaction: its thickness is chosen to correspond to AF coupling [128,129]. very thin. Simplistically, the skyrmions that are observed in such systems can be considered as a pair of chiral domain walls and the current driving mechanisms are very similar to those of the individual DWs except that the topological charge of the skyrmion causes them to move partly sideways perpendicular to the current flow direction. This makes their use in racetracks challenging.There have been several proposals to replace the DWs in a racetrack with skyrmions or other related objects, some of which are discussed elsewhere in this review.

        <p>Interest in skyrmions for racetrack memory data bits was originally based on the observation that bulk skyrmions in the single crystalline B20 compound MnSi could be moved with very low current densities [11], orders of magnitude below the critical current density above which chiral DWs can be moved with spin-orbit torques. It is an inevitable consequence that these very low current densities also correspond to very slow motion of the skyrmions. For some applications of racetrack memory, for example, to replace vertical NAND flash memories, small current densities may be advantageous and the consequent slow motion of the magnetic bits might be acceptable. In any case the ability to be able to vary performance and to trade off energy with speed in racetrack devices is very attractive.Interest in skyrmions for racetrack memory data bits was originally based on the observation that bulk skyrmions in the single crystalline B20 compound MnSi could be moved with very low current densities [11], orders of magnitude below the critical current density above which chiral DWs can be moved with spin-orbit torques.

        <p>As discussed in Tokura et al several types of bulk skyrmions, both Bloch and Néel, have been discovered in various materials as well as, more recently, anti-skyrmions in an inverse tetragonal Heusler compound [9]. Each of these objects has distinct properties that could make them of interest for various device applications. Anti-skyrmions are of special interest in that they are innately stable spin textures [120]. To date no current induced motion of anti-skyrmions has been demonstrated but, theoretically, the motion under spin-orbit torques is more complex than for skrymions. The latter move sideways when current is applied, as mentioned above, but anti-skyrmions are predicted to move in straight lines or to the left or to the right when excited by spin-orbit torques, depending on the current direction relative to the complex wall structure of the anti-skyrmion. Whilst this is potentially of use this means that if the racetrack is formed from polycrystalline material the motion of an anti-skyrmion in each grain could be in different directions. Moreover, it is not clear that there would not be a considerable barrier to the passage of the antiskyrmion from one grain to the next since the anti-skyrmion's structure is directly tied to the underlying crystal lattice. This is a very interesting question and a possible challenge to the use of anti-skrymions for racetrack memory devices. The recent discovery that anti-skyrmion co-exist or can be transformed into a bloch like skyrmions [121,122] makes them even more interesting for device applications.As discussed in Tokura et al several types of bulk skyrmions, both Bloch and Néel, have been discovered in various materials as well as, more recently, anti-skyrmions in an inverse tetragonal Heusler compound [9].

        <p>A major challenge is to scale racetracks to dimensions that would make them technologically relevant (this is also a challenge for DW based racetrack devices). This means exploring the motion of skyrmions in racetracks that are perhaps 20-50 nm wide and where the skyrmions themselves are just 20 nm in diameter and spaced similarly. There are some recent experiments which demonstrated the current induced motion of skyrmions are, however, comparatively large (&gt;100 nm) [16,55,56,123]. To make applications of skyrmions possible, much more progress is needed in decreasing their size. This is clearly not easy and their detection is much more difficult than chiral DWs for several reasons. Firstly, DWs are straight and secondly, the domains with opposite magnetizations between the DWs can be detected, whereas for skyrmions, their boundaries are curved and the difference in magnetization between their interior and their exterior is much smaller. The detection of skyrmions is likely possible via integrated magnetic tunnel junctions but it is not easy to fabricate such magnetic tunnel junctions nor to create them with sufficient signal to differentiate individual skrymions.A major challenge is to scale racetracks to dimensions that would make them technologically relevant (this is also a challenge for DW based racetrack devices).

        <p>It is clear that zero moment skyrmions akin to SAF chiral domain walls are needed in order to avoid interactions between the skyrmions via dipole fields. For skyrmion bubbles it is, of course, obvious that the concept of the SAF racetrack is directly transferable by simply replacing an SAF DW with an SAF skyrmion, as shown in figure 12(d). For bulk skyrmions, similar concepts are possible. Another possibility is to tune the magnetization in the host compound to zero: this would be possible, for example, in ferrimagnetic host materials, such as inverse tetragonal Heusler compounds that host anti-skyrmions [124]. It was shown possible some time ago to switch the magnetization of a ferrimagnetic layer whose magnetization is zero by current by relying on sub-lattices with distinct interactions with the current [125]. Recently it has similarly been shown that domain walls can be moved by current even when the magnetization of a ferrimagnetic racetrack formed from a Co-Gd amorphous alloy is zero [126]: indeed the domain wall velocity was shown to be largest not when the magnetic moments of the Co and Gd sub-lattices are equal (and opposite) but rather when their angular momenta are exactly compensated. Much progress has been made on this topic recently [123,127].It is clear that zero moment skyrmions akin to SAF chiral domain walls are needed in order to avoid interactions between the skyrmions via dipole fields.

        <p>Other major challenges include understanding how to overcome pinning of skyrmions at defects or at edges of racetracks, and to ensure sufficient thermal stability of skyrmions at dimensions that are useful over long periods of time (10 years for useful devices). Low current densities at which skyrmions move means that they may be unstable to thermal fluctuations so that mechanisms to trap the individual skyrmions are needed. Whilst it is straightforward to envisage trapping of skyrmions in large devices, for example, by forming notches or anti-notches, this is very difficult to achieve in 20 nm sized objects.Other major challenges include understanding how to overcome pinning of skyrmions at defects or at edges of racetracks, and to ensure sufficient thermal stability of skyrmions at dimensions that are useful over long periods of time (10 years for useful devices).

        <p>The family of non collinear chiral nano-objects continues to expand with an increasing number of skyrmion and antiskyrmion objects with distinct properties depending on the symmetry of the host material. These objects have extraordinary properties that make them of great scientific interest. The roadmap to technological applications is very challenging with the need to develop devices that are perhaps just 10-20 nm in size, in which the skyrmions can be both written and read, in which the skyrmions do not significantly interact with one another, and in which they are sufficiently thermally stable. When these challenges are solved chiral non-collinear spin textures could herald the dawn of new all solid-state spintronic memory-storage devices that would have storage capacities, performance and reliability that go well beyond today's technologies.The family of non collinear chiral nano-objects continues to expand with an increasing number of skyrmion and antiskyrmion objects with distinct properties depending on the symmetry of the host material.

        <p>In thin films, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI) that gives rise to skyrmions is produced either by broken inversion symmetry from the interface or by inversion asymmetry in the bulk of the film, or both. Interfacial DMI enables the use of common centrosymmetric ferromagnets such as Co to be employed, see section 11. Such systems require relatively complex precious-metal multilayers, and their magnetic properties are averaged across the film stack. On the other hand, chiral magnets that derive their DMI from bulk inversion asymmetry require only one single layer and may prove to be more resilient to skyrmion annihilation through sample edges. The major challenge with this second class of material is to find a way to prevent crystallographic grains with both left and right-handed chirality from forming when deposited on centrosymmetric substrates-an essential requirement for applications such as racetrack memories, see section 9.In thin films, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI) that gives rise to skyrmions is produced either by broken inversion symmetry from the interface or by inversion asymmetry in the bulk of the film, or both.

        <p>Of all the currently available chiral magnetic films fabricated from materials that host skyrmions in bulk crystal, the vast majority of films are from the archetypal B20 family. The B20 silicides and germanides are well lattice matched to Si (111) and grow well on these technologically relevant substrates, but can also be grown epitaxially on MgO and SiC(0001). Numerous examples exist in the literature, including MnSi, Fe x Co 1 -x Si, FeGe, Fe 1 -x Co x Ge, Fe 1 -x Mn x Ge and MnGe (see [133,134] and references therein). High quality films on large area substrates create the possibility to explore the influence of anisotropy and finite size effects on chiral magnets. Anisotropy provides an important mechanism for increasing the skyrmion stability, which is enhanced along the easy direction, or in an easy-plane, but is reduced along a hard-axis or in a hard-plane relative to the competing cone phase [135].Of all the currently available chiral magnetic films fabricated from materials that host skyrmions in bulk crystal, the vast majority of films are from the archetypal B20 family.

        <p>Finite size effects arise from the presence of DMI in the zero-torque boundary conditions, which creates surface states that decay into the bulk of the film on a length scale set by the helical wavelength, L D and the applied magnetic field [136]. One-dimensional surface twists first were first observed in polarized neutron reflectometry measurements in the field induced ferromagnetic state of MnSi/Si(111) [135]. These twists produce a confining potential for skyrmions that is crucial for devices, since film edges remove the skyrmions' topological protection [136]. Micromagnetic calculations show that the surface states produce a cross-over in the magnetic behaviour for film thicknesses below approximately 8L D , where skyrmions are stabilized over a large portion of the phase diagram [137,138]. This provides a natural definition for what is considered a thin film in the case of a chiral magnet.Finite size effects arise from the presence of DMI in the zero-torque boundary conditions, which creates surface states that decay into the bulk of the film on a length scale set by the helical wavelength, L D and the applied magnetic field [136].

        <p>Despite numerous examples of high-quality films, there exists disagreement over the magnetic structure of these materials. In the case of MnSi, Si (111) and SiC(0001) substrates create a hard-axis anisotropy that reduces the skyrmion stability relative to the cone phase along the axis. Whereas the magnetometry measurements shown in figure 13, and Lorentz transmission electron microscopy measurements find the cone phase as the sole thermodynamically stable state along this axis, anomalous features appear in the Hall effect measurements in this region of the phase diagram. Non-adiabatic spin transport through the cone phase provides an interpretation that reconciles these observations that is also consistent with bulk measurements (see references in [139]). The observer Hall signal may be an example of the chiral Hall effect [140]. This proposal needs further theoretical and experimental studies that will be crucial for using the Hall effect to detect topological textures.Despite numerous examples of high-quality films, there exists disagreement over the magnetic structure of these materials.

However, evidence of skyrmions is not observed in a glancing-incidence SANS measurement of a single film [143]. Interpretation of the electron transport measurements are at odds with the phase diagram derived from neutron scattering [144], which calls for further theoretical investigations of the planar-Hall effect.For in-plane magnetic fields, polarized neutronreflectometry finds low temperature discrete helicoidal states, and a highly disordered in-plane skyrmion state at higher temperatures, as shown in figure 14.

        <p>One of the immediate challenges for chiral epitaxial films is the stabilization of samples with a single chirality. To address the influence of strain and misfit dislocations, B20 films could be grown on bulk B20 single crystals. A large range of lattice mismatch is in principle possible in the large B20 family. For applications, however, the skyrmion materials need to be grown on common semiconducting substrates. The fact that the most commonly available substrates are centrosymmetric poses a significant challenge: an enantiomorphic grain structure in the films is unavoidable without some additional symmetry breaking at the substrate interface, such as with a chiral surfactant or perhaps carefully prepared vicinal surfaces.One of the immediate challenges for chiral epitaxial films is the stabilization of samples with a single chirality.

        <p>Studies of the magnetic properties in spin glasses revealed that chiral magnetic interactions between neighboring spins can play a key role in metallic based systems. Extending the 3sites RKKY model to bilayer systems, it has been predicted [148] that a large Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) should be present at the interface between a magnetic film and a heavy material with large spin-orbit coupling. The pioneer works on surface magnetism in various model thin films realized in the 2000 s by SP-STM confirmed this prediction with the observation of spin spiral states induced by a large DMI and ultimately of a skyrmion lattice phase in one monolayer of Fe on Ir (111) [102]. The investigation of magnetic skyrmions in such ultrathin epitaxial films represents a fundamental interest but are hardly relevant for the observation and then the use of skyrmions at room temperature (RT). For this purpose, the best solution up to now seems to increase the effective magnetic volume by using multilayer stacks composed of multiple repetitions of thin magnetic metal layers separated by heavy metal nonmagnetic layers grown by sputtering deposition (figure 15(a)). This approach enables the increase of the thermal stability of columnar skyrmions, that are coupled in the successive layers, leading to the recent observation of sub-100 nm skyrmions stable at RT in different multilayer systems [149,150,151]. Another advantage of the multilayer approach is that it offers multiple opportunities to finely tailor the skyrmion characteristics, e.g. by changing the material combination (magnetic metals, heavy metals, ferroelectrics), by tuning the different interactions or by varying the number of repetitions in the multilayers. Initially randomly created using sweeping of a perpendicular field, often at a defect position, skyrmions in multilayers can be created by spin transfer torques and thermal effects induced by current pulses near constrictions, as in figure 15(b) [152] or local current injector [56,153]. Recently, Hall resistivity measurements (mostly anomalous Hall effect, AHE) was used to electrically detect single sub-100 nm skyrmions [154,155] (figure 15(c)). Finally, these skyrmions are moved using spin-orbit torque associated to spin Hall effect [55] (figure 15(d)), with velocities that are for the moment around 100 m s -1 for current densities of a few 10 11 A/m 2 , i.e. in the range of current densities used today in spintronic devices.Studies of the magnetic properties in spin glasses revealed that chiral magnetic interactions between neighboring spins can play a key role in metallic based systems.

        <p>Up to now, a large dispersion of skyrmion sizes has been found from less than 100 nm [149,151] to a few µm [39] even if the multilayer structures only slightly differ. Actually, the skyrmion size depends on the balance between the magnetic interactions: DMI, exchange, anisotropy, interlayer dipole fields (related to magnetization with additional effects of the number of repetitions in case of multilayers [156]). A future challenge is to refine the material and interfacial properties to reach the best compromise for achieving the desired skyrmion properties in terms of size, 3D shape, stability and mobility at low current density. Further efforts on material science are also necessary to reduce the influence of grains and/or local material inhomogeneities on the actual skyrmion shape [157]. This perturbation is found to be particularly important when grains and skyrmions are of similar sizes, which is often the case in today's multilayers [157,158]. Concerning the nucleation of skyrmions, the next challenge is a better control leading to a deterministic nucleation both in space and time. In pursuing this aim, the exploration of other mechanisms such as vertical injection of pure spin current [159,] or vertical electric field [160,161] are promising techniques. Also it is predicted that the topology of the magnetization distribution should give rise to an additional effect, the topological Hall effect (THE). However, in metallic heterostructures, a clear physical picture did not emerge yet and it is difficult to conclude whether this THE effect exists or not [154,155] as it is extremely difficult to single out from the predominant more standard AHE [161]. Moreover, the scaling of THE for skyrmions down to 10 nm is unknown. Finally, the improvement of the spin torque induced motion of skyrmions probably remains the largest challenge as the interaction of skyrmions with the defects and inhomogeneities in today structures largely impedes linear motion and large disparities between skyrmions velocities are observed. Another challenge related to skyrmion topology is the so-called skyrmion Hall effect (SkHE) leading to a generally undesired oblique motion particularly in 1D devices such as racetracks.Up to now, a large dispersion of skyrmion sizes has been found from less than 100 nm [149,151] to a few µm [39] even if the multilayer structures only slightly differ.

        <p>Reducing the skyrmion diameter down to 10 nm or less requires further improvements of the engineering of the multilayer properties, and particularly of the control of the interlayer dipolar field effects that can even lead to layer-dependent size and chirality of the skyrmions in terms of CW, CCW, Néel, or Bloch-like rotation of the magnetization through the skyrmion diameter [156] (figure 16(a)). Key advances for size reduction and improved mobility are anticipated from analytical modelling considering all the magnetic interactions in heterostructures, including interlayer RKKY interaction allowing the development, beyond ferromagnetic heterostructures, of synthetic ferrimagnetic and synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) multilayers. The observation of such ultrasmall skyrmions and their 3D shaping will require sophisticated x-ray based techniques (i.e. magnetic holography, tomography, etc), advanced electron microscopy and NV center microscopy to characterize the 3D magnetization textures, possibly with compensated magnetization. On the material side, targeting systems with reduced magnetization to decrease dipolar fields, ferrimagnetic transition metal-rare earth alloys have recently been used allowing the RT stabilization of skyrmion in the 20 nm range [162]. Pushing further this strategy, heterostructures including a Ru layer to induce an RKKY antiferromagnetic coupling between the magnetic layers allow cancelling the detrimental action (increase of diameter, hybrid texture, etc) of the interlayer dipolar fields [162,163]. In such systems in which antiferromagnetic skyrmions have been observed [164] the interfacial DMI becomes again the key parameter for the control of size and stability. Interestingly, it has been recently discovered that large DMI are not only found at interfaces with heavy metals, but also with graphene or oxides, which further opens the field of possible heterostructures. Another great interest of SAF multilayers is that the SkHE should be opposed in layers of opposite magnetization, thus resulting in a purely longitudinal motion, probably desirable in future devices (figure 16(b)). The improvement of the materials will involve the use of multilayers having much less defects, such as amorphous layers or crystalline systems, as well as materials with larger efficiency than heavy metals for the production of spin current, e.g. Rashba interfaces and/or topological insulators. Reproducible creation of skyrmions in a precise location by current near local sources of inhomogeneity requires the development of technologies (FIB, ion implantation, etc) allowing the introduction of local defects or nanoconstrictions. This approach could be seen as complementary to the existing demonstration using nano-patterned electrodes [56,153]. The detection of skyrmions should be extended to smaller sizes by improvement of AHE techniques or detection by vertical structures (TMR or GMR). Concerning the THE, a better understanding should be obtained in models going beyond the adiabatic limit and also taking into account the finite mean free path of the electrons.Reducing the skyrmion diameter down to 10 nm or less requires further improvements of the engineering of the multilayer properties, and particularly of the control of the interlayer dipolar field effects that can even lead to layer-dependent size and chirality of the skyrmions in terms of CW, CCW, Néel, or Bloch-like rotation of the magnetization through the skyrmion diameter [156] (figure 16(a)).

The first examples of interfaceinduced magnetic skyrmions were in model-type systems of highly ordered epitaxially grown atomic layers on single crystal surfaces [38,102]. Skyrmions in such systems range from less than 3 nm [38,102,165] over about 50 nm [166] to approx. 200 nm [167] in diameter. Real-space spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments together with abinitio calculations have provided a very good understanding of the relevant energies and ground state formation mechanisms [38,102,166,168]. Whereas ultrathin films have mostly been studied at low temperature and skyrmions are induced by magnetic fields on the order of 1 T, some systems can be described by micromagnetic theory [165,166], like most bulk-DMI and magnetic multilayer samples. In other systems exchange interactions between more distant atoms have been found to play a role [102,168,169], which can act together with the DMI to favor non-collinear states over the ferromagnetic state (see also section 2).Magnetic skyrmions are stabilized by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), which imposes a unique rotational sense on the spin texture.

        <p>There have been advances in the electrical detection of single magnetic skyrmions without the need for high spatial resolution via Hall measurements, however the origin of the signal is still under debate [154,155]. The non-collinear magnetoresistance, as found experimentally with STM for a model system [171], see figures 17(a) and (b), has not yet been singled out in spatially averaging magnetoresistance measurements. On the contrary, the concept of electric field induced switching of magnetic skyrmions demonstrated for a model system using the tip of an STM [160], see figures 17(a) and (c), has been transferred to a planar insulator in contact with a magnetic film and an influence of the electric field on the magnetic state has been shown [172].There have been advances in the electrical detection of single magnetic skyrmions without the need for high spatial resolution via Hall measurements, however the origin of the signal is still under debate [154,155].

        <p>Regarding possible future skyrmionic devices the study of atomically thin magnetic films is important for an understanding of the fundamental properties of skyrmions on a microscopic scale. A fine-tuning of the magnetic properties of a material can be guided by such investigations and a realization of lateral movement of skyrmions in an STM setup could resolve many open questions regarding interactions of skyrmions with each other and with structural defects. The study of model-type systems facilitates the discovery and detailed understanding of novel physical mechanisms which are expected to advance the field. For instance the combination of all electrical detection of skyrmions with vertical tunnel currents and an electric field driven writing and deleting of skyrmions could be exploited in future skyrmion-based devices using a single planar tunnel junction as read/write head, see figures 17(a) and (d).Regarding possible future skyrmionic devices the study of atomically thin magnetic films is important for an understanding of the fundamental properties of skyrmions on a microscopic scale.

        <p>To boost the application of magnetic skyrmions in information technology, it is essential to thoroughly understand both static and dynamical behaviors of skyrmion in various nanostructures with sizes comparable to skyrmions. Nanoribbons and nanowires can be used as a prototype of skyrmion-based racetrack memory [173], and nanodisks can be potentially used as skyrmion-based nano-oscillators [174]. The device perspectives are extensively discussed in Chapter 9. In these geometries, extra magnetic anisotropy at the surface and skyrmion-edge interactions become important due to large surface-bulk ratio, and long-range dipolar interaction between magnetic moments also plays a significant role. As a result, skyrmion textures therein can exist even in the absence of external magnetic field, in contrast to bulk samples. Other exotic topological spin textures, such as bobbers and hopfions [175,176], will also emerge.To boost the application of magnetic skyrmions in information technology, it is essential to thoroughly understand both static and dynamical behaviors of skyrmion in various nanostructures with sizes comparable to skyrmions.

        <p>There have been extensive investigations of skyrmions dynamics driven by external stimuli, such as electric current, in bulk samples. However, nontrivial topology of skyrmion induces a transverse motion, dubbed as the skyrmion Hall effect [177], and a collision between skyrmions and the edge is thus inevitable in confined geometries. Due to the missing spins across the sample boundary, magnetic moments form a chiral edge mode with opposite rotation sense as the skyrmions therein, so the interaction between skyrmions and the boundary is highly nontrivial. On the other hand, the constricted geometry provides possibility to create individual skyrmions. As an example, sending a current through a notch in a nanoribbon, a single skyrmion can be generated [178]. That is fundamentally attributed to the chiral edge state. Topological charge around the notch is nonzero even at zero field, so that skyrmions can be easily nucleated. The same scenario applies to ultranarrow nanoribbons [179]. At zero field, helices are formed with their wave vector pointing along the ribbon. On the upper and bottom edges, helical stripes connect to the edge spin state and form local distribution of the topological charge (figure 18(a)). Therefore, confined geometry provides a platform for investigating nontrivial topological textures and opens many opportunities to manipulate skyrmions.There have been extensive investigations of skyrmions dynamics driven by external stimuli, such as electric current, in bulk samples.

        <p>Studying skyrmions in confined geometries faces both experimental and theoretical challenges. Most skyrmions of interests have a size of sub-100 nm, so that confined geometry reveals its unique feature only when its size is on the same scale. An advanced nanostructure fabrication is thus required, which can be achieved by lithography and etching technique based on high quality skyrmion thin films, or directly use focused ion beam for bulk crystals although an intricate receipt is needed. Imaging skyrmions and resolving fine spin structures in these nanostructures are also extremely difficult. Lorentz transmission electron microscope (TEM) is broadly used for nanometer magnetic imaging. However, at the sample boundary, the sudden drop of electrostatic potential leads to strong Fresnel fringes and give rise to artificial magnetic contrast across hundreds of nanometers. It is thus difficult to differentiate the true spin textures from these artifacts. Other than the spatial resolution, reaching high temporal resolution and tracking the motion of skyrmion in nanoribbons will be a milestone of the field. A skyrmion velocity of 100 m/s requires a temporal resolution of nanoseconds in order to monitor the motion of a 100 nm-size skyrmion. Recent advances of time-resolved pumpprobe x-ray microscopy has been used to study skyrmion in thin films [16,153]. Extra effort will be paid to push its spatial resolutions.Studying skyrmions in confined geometries faces both experimental and theoretical challenges.

        <p>Theoretically modeling the stability, dynamics and interactions of skyrmions in confined geometry require innovations in analytical approaches. On the numerical side, high performance micro-or atomistic magnetic simulation with dipolar interaction and possibly extra surface interaction taken into account. It was recently suggested that the interaction between the skyrmion and sample edge is not always repulsive, but can be attractive due to the background spin configurations [180]. Therefore, integration between the dynamic simulation and the study of phase diagram in confined geometry is important. The experimental discovery of target skyrmion in a FeGe nanodisk of finite thickness indicates the importance of threedimensional (3D) confinement [181]. Further exploration of 3D topological spin textures becomes an important topic in the emerging stream of 3D spintronics, thus detailed simulations need to be done.

        <p>Imaging of skyrmions in nanoribbons and nanodisks with significant reduction of artifical boundary fringes have been enabled already by Lorentz TEM. An amorphous Pt layer coated at the edge was employed to successfully reduce the boundary Fresnel fringes in these nanosized samples [179]. In the FeGe nanoribbon with width down to 130 nm, the chiral edge spin state was clearly identified. At low fields, helical stripes with k vector parallel with the ribbon is the ground state, and a single skyrmion chain is nucleated once the field is elevated (figure 18(b)). Interestingly, even in wider ribbons at low temperatures, only one skyrmion chain is generated, which appears on the ribbon edge first and gradually shifts to the ribbon center when field increases. This suggests an exotic field-dependent interaction between skyrmions and the edge. Recent micromagnetic simulation has revealed a Lennard-Jones nature of this interaction [180]. Further local magnetic imaging is desired and NV magnetometry might be a promising method at this point [183].Imaging of skyrmions in nanoribbons and nanodisks with significant reduction of artifical boundary fringes have been enabled already by Lorentz TEM.

        <p>Interests have emerged on studying skyrmions and other relevant topological spin textures in 3D confined geometries. In bulk samples, skyrmions stack quite uniformly along the field direction and form arrays of tubes. However, at the sample boundary, skyrmion tube twists due to imbalanced DM interaction, and the bobber state can appear where the skyrmion tube terminates at a Bloch point [175]. Furthermore, target skyrmion, a state consists of multiple concentric spin helices [184], was observed in nanodisks with thickness comparable to the skyrmion size [181] (figures 19(a)-(c)). Importantly, this state is stabilized by the dipolar interaction and persists in the absence of magnetic field. As a consequence, two species of target skyrmions are degenerate, and can be switched from one to the other by an external magnetic field. Once this nanodisk is sandwiched in between two spinpolarized layers, another spin texture called hopfion has been theoretically predicted [176], whose lateral cross-section consists of a pair of skyrmion and anti-skyrmion (figure 19(d) and (e)). Its dynamical behavior and the influence of geometrical confinement are worth exploring in the future. Material realization of the hopfion and other 3D spin textures is worth extensive study [185], and advanced tomography techniques capable of imaging 3D spin textures are being developed [186].Interests have emerged on studying skyrmions and other relevant topological spin textures in 3D confined geometries.

Therefore, they have the common features with other physical phenomena driven by spin-orbit interaction with broken inversion symmetry such as the surface states of topological insulators and noncentrosymmetric superconductors, and hence it makes sense to consider the hybrid of skyrmions and these other systems [187].

        <p>The skyrnions on TI surface is an interesting topics since the coupling to the surface state produces the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), which can cause the skyrmion formation. A numerical calculation has been done for a model system aiming at Bi 2 Se 3 doped with Cr, and it is concluded that skyrmions of Neel type is stabilized in the hole doped case. Experimentally, this prediction has been tested by the measurement of topological Hall effect in the heterostructure of Cr x (Bi 1 -y Sb y ) 2 -x Te 3 /(Bi 1 -y Sb y ) 2 Te 3 [189] (see figure 20).

A related theoretical work has been done on the anomalous topological Hall effect due to skyrmions on topological surface state. The next target in this system is the skyrmion motion driven by the current. Because of the spinmomentum locking in the surface state, the spin transfer torque and spin-orbit torque are expected to be very different from the usual metals. The detailed studies changing the current density and chemical potential position by gating are highly desired to identify the mechanisms.The skyrnions on TI surface is an interesting topics since the coupling to the surface state produces the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), which can cause the skyrmion formation.

        <p>The interplay between the skyrmion and superconductivity is another interesting issue. As for the Majorana fermions, it has been theoretically predicted that the p + ip superconductivity and associated chiral Majorana edge channel are realized as the in-gap superconductivity induced by the Shiba states [191]. Also the Majorana bound state is predicted theoretically at skyrmion [192]. It is also proposed that the magnetic skyrmions can control the Josephson effect where the critical current is changed by several orders of magnitude simply by reversing the helicity of a magnetic skyrmion [193]. It is expected that in iron-based superconductors (FeSCs) when inversion symmetry is broken, e.g. monolayer iron selenide (FeSe) on a strontium titanate (SrTiO3(001)) substrate, the noncollinar spin structure essentially equivalent to the skyrmion crystal is realized [194]. Also similar skyrmion lattice texture is predicted for the superconductor at LAO/STO interface as shown in figure 21 [195]. The remaining challenges are the experimental tests of these theoretical predictions.

        <p>Combining skyrmions with topological insulators and superconductors is a big challenge especially for experimentalists. The most important step is to prepare the sample in a well controlled way. First the homogeneity of proximity effect of the magnets, superconductors, and topological surface is the crucial issue. For example, the spatially varying exchange gap observed in magnetic topological insulator surface is regarded as the main reason to suppress the temperature where the quantized anomalous Hall effect is observed. Superlattice formation and modulation doping can be a method to improve this problem. Second the direct real-space observation of the spin and electronic structures is desirable in addition to the transport measurements. Lorentz microscopy and spin-resolved STM have been successful for this purpose, and the simultaneous observation of the spin and electrons by combining these tools would provide rich information. Thirdly, the fine tuning of the parameter such as the size of the skyrmions, chemical potential µ for electrons, thickness of the films, etc is an important tool to identify the physical mechanisms behind the phenomenon. Lastly, the quantum dynamics of the composite system is a mostly unexplored problem, which will reveal the excitation spectrum of the system in addition to the ground state and low-lying excitations. Accurate optical spectroscopy including real-time resolution would be a powerful tool for this purpose. For example, the rapid change in the magnetic structure would produce the gigantic emergent electric field, which might induce novel phenomena unique to the skyrmionic systems. Although most of the hybrid systems discussed above are synthetic layered systems, it would be an interesting direction to pursue the bulk hybrid systems. In this case, the coexistence of the different orders is required in the bulk. Magnetic noncentrosymmetric superconductors, it they exist, can be a candidate from this viewpoint. Topological spin textures in three-dimensional magnetic topological insulators are another interesting system.Combining skyrmions with topological insulators and superconductors is a big challenge especially for experimentalists. The most important step is to prepare the sample in a well controlled way. First the homogeneity of proximity effect of the magnets, superconductors, and topological surface is the crucial issue. For example, the spatially varying exchange gap observed in magnetic topological insulator surface is regarded as the main reason to suppress the temperature where the quantized anomalous Hall effect is observed.

        <p>Theoretically, the unified treatment of the skyrmion structures in real and momentum spaces is a challenging issue. The spin-orbit interaction produces the spin structure in the crystal momentum space in noncentrosymmetric system, i.e. the spin splitting occurs at generic k-point except the time-reversal symmetric momenta to produce the spin texture. This can be often topological, e.g. skyrmion and monopole. The interplay between these real-space and momentum-space emergent electromagnetic field will be a most interesting theoretical issue including their dynamics.Theoretically, the unified treatment of the skyrmion structures in real and momentum spaces is a challenging issue.

        <p>Inversion symmetry breaking combined with the relativistic spin-orbit interaction offers a rich variety of physical phenomena which might leads to novel functions of materials. Spintronics application of TI surface, singlet-triplet mixing in noncentrosymmetric superconductors, skyrmion formation in chiral magnets are the representative examples, which have been studied rather independently. These apparently different phenomena have a basic principle in common, i.e. the emergent gauge field or emergent electromagnetic field. Therefore, it is most natural to consider the combination of these by fabricating the hybrid systems of skyrmions, topological insulator, and superconductors, and explore their interplay. From the point of view of applications, the nonreciprocal responses including the directional propagation of quasi-particles and non-linear rectification effect unique to the noncentrosymmetric systems with broken time-reversal symmetry are the promising direction [196]. Generalization of the concept of skyrmions will find the more progress in the future.Inversion symmetry breaking combined with the relativistic spin-orbit interaction offers a rich variety of physical phenomena which might leads to novel functions of materials.
