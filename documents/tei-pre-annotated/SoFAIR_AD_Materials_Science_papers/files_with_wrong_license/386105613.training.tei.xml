        <p>Renewable and cleaner energy resources, such as wind, solar and nuclear, are being extensively researched due to the increasing energy demand, depleting fossil fuel reserves and environmental concerns.Renewable and cleaner energy resources, such as wind, solar and nuclear, are being extensively researched due to the increasing energy demand, depleting fossil fuel reserves and environmental concerns.</p>
        <p>However, the successful realization of renewable energy technology requires the development of efficient, cost-effective and large-scale energy storage systems (ESSs). [1,2] Li-ion batteries (LIBs), currently the most widely employed energy storage devices, were commercialized by Sony in the 1990s and attained ubiquitous status in modern life. [3] However, the large-scale development 3 of LIBs is hindered by the cost of lithium (Li) metal due to limited resources. Only 20 ppm Li exists in Earth's crust, leading to the extremely high cost of Li-containing salts and active materials. [4] Sodium (Na), on the other hand, is the fourth most abundant metal element (2.74%) in Earth crust and exhibits similar chemical properties to Li (Fig. 1), arousing extensive research interest as a possible replacement of Li metal in rechargeable batteries. [4][5][6][7] Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) were first studied in the 1970s, but the rapid development and successful commercialization of LIBs diverted the research focus from SIBs. [1,[8][9][10][11] Despite the similar energy storage mechanism of SIBs and LIBs, some differences still exist between them. For example, the difference in ionic radii of Na + ions (1.02 Å) and Li + ions (0.76 Å) hinders the common electrodes in LIBs to be used in SIBs. [12] Moreover, the higher molar mass and standard electrode potential of Na (23 g mol -1 and -2.71 V vs. SHE) compared to Li (6.9 g mol -1 and -3.02 V vs. SHE) lead to a lower energy density. [1] However, the charge storage capacity is mainly determined by the structural features of the electrode materials and both Na and Li contribute only a small part of the electrode weight. Therefore, the difference in the energy density of LIBs and SIBs has negligible consequences. [6] Furthermore, aluminum (Al) can be utilized as an anode current collector instead of copper (Cu) in SIBs because, unlike Li, Na does not react with Al. This represents a significant potential cost 4 reduction if SIBs could be widely utilized. However, low power density and poor cyclic performance raise serious concerns on the development and commercialization of SIBs. Electrochemical capacitors are promising alternatives or complementary technology to secondary batteries due to their high power densities and superior cyclic performance. Charge storage in an electrochemical capacitor is limited to the electrode surface, leading to lower charge storage capacity and inferior energy density. On the other hand, hybrid-ion capacitors combine the advantages of battery-type and electric double layer capacitive (EDLC) materials, which might exhibit high energy density, high power density and ultra-long lifetime simultaneously. Li-ion capacitors (LICs) are the most prominent hybrid-ion capacitors, possessing relative high energy density, power density and cyclic life. However, similar to LIBs, the high cost and scarcity of Li-metal hinder the large-scale utilization of LICs. As such, sodium-ion capacitors (SICs) are potential candidates for large-scale energy storage applications due to the cost and the abundance of Na. The development of high-performance SICs is limited by the slow kinetics of battery-type anode and low capacitance of activated carbon (AC) cathode in organic electrolytes, where the former leads to unfavorable rate capability and inferior cyclic stability, and the later leads to low energy density. [13,14] Therefore, the electrochemical properties of both cathode and anode should be optimized to make them suitable for commercial SICs.However, the successful realization of renewable energy technology requires the development of efficient, cost-effective and large-scale energy storage systems (ESSs).

        <p>Different carbonaceous materials have been extensively studied as electrode materials for sodium ion batteries and capacitors due to their accessibility, non-toxicity and high chemical stability. [15][16][17][18][19] However, the carbon materials still exhibit several disadvantages, including high manufacturing cost, complex synthesis processes and environmental pollution.

        <p>Typically, biomass-derived carbon displays a specific morphology, such as fibers [21] or nanosheets [22] , which is highly desirable for energy storage devices, as shown in Fig. 2. Significantly, biomass-derived carbon possesses advantages to obtain high-performance structures, [23] such as the naturally porous features, hierarchical and/or fiber structures of biomass that can be remained in the pyrolyzed product. These features enable effective penetration of the electrolyte into the structure and shorten the ion diffusion route. Moreover, elements such as nitrogen (N), boron (B) etc., exist in natural biomass, which remain as heteroatoms after processing, enhancing the electrical conductivity and absorption, thus improving the electrochemical performance of biomass-derived carbons. [23][24][25] Furthermore, the utilization of biomass for carbon production is a cost-effective and eco-friendly approach because it enables recyclability of different waste materials, such as banana peel [26] , macadamia shells [27] , cellulose [28,29] and lignin [30,31,32] .Typically, biomass-derived carbon displays a specific morphology, such as fibers [21] or nanosheets [22] , which is highly desirable for energy storage devices, as shown in Fig. 2.

        <p>A battery consists of three basic components: an anode, a cathode and an electrolyte. In the case of SIBs, Na ions shuttle between the anode and cathode compartments during the charge/discharge process. The choice of anode material significantly influences the performance of SIBs because it can limit the rate of electrochemical reactions. One should note that, unlike cathode materials, a limited number of anode materials are available for SIBs due to dendrite formation and the relatively low melting point of Na.A battery consists of three basic components: an anode, a cathode and an electrolyte.

        <p>Different forms of carbon-based materials, including graphite-based carbon, graphene, soft and hard carbons, have been investigated as anode materials in SIBs. [47] Theoretically, it has been confirmed that Na ions can be easily intercalated into carbonaceous materials with an interlayer 9 distance higher than 0.37 nm [48] , as shown in Fig. 3a. As the interlayer distance between graphite sheets is only 0.335 nm, natural graphite only possesses a low theoretical charge storage capacity. Similarly, Na ions cannot penetrate into voids of soft carbon due to its interlayer distance (&lt;0.35 nm) and random orientation of layers, and as such Na ions tend to absorb on the surface and defect sites of soft carbon. [49] In the case of graphene, the absorption characteristics are improved by high surface area, which yields more sites for Na ions adsorption. The galvanostatic charge-discharge profiles of graphite-based carbon, soft carbon and graphene are shown in Fig. 3b, where a monotonically decreasing capacity is observed with the interesting potential. Moreover, different types of carbons display different reversible capacities and initial coulomb efficiency (ICE). In summary, the charge storage mechanism of these three types of carbonaceous materials for SIBs is that Na ions only adsorbed on electrochemically active surface and defect sites. Compared with graphite-based carbon, soft carbon and graphene, the charge storage mechanism of hard carbon is more complicated. Two clear regions, usually labelled as the sloping region and plateau region, can be readily observed from the voltage-capacity curve of hard carbon, as shown in Fig. 3b. [50] These regions indicate the presence of different charge storage mechanisms, as proposed by various research groups. [48,51,53] An insertion-absorption mechanism was first proposed by Stevens and Dahn in 2001 [51] , as shown in Fig. 3c. The results of in-situ X-ray scattering demonstrated that the interlayer distance of adjacent carbon layers of dehydrated glucose changes significantly in the sloping region. Moreover, by using in-situ small-angle X-ray scattering, they confirmed that the electron density contrast within the nanopores decreased with Na + insertion and increased with Na + desertion during the low-potential plateau region. From these results, they concluded that the sloping potential profiles in the high voltage region corresponded to the intercalation of Na ions, whereas Na ions were inserted into nanopores along the low-voltage plateau. In 2012, Cao et al. [48] reported on the sodium storage behavior of hollow carbon nanowires and proposed an absorption-insertion mechanism. They suggested that Na ions were adsorbed on the surface of hollow carbon nanowires during the high-potential sloping region and inserted into voids during the low-potential plateau region, as shown in Fig. 3d. Later, the proposed mechanism was confirmed by using a combination of in-situ X-ray diffraction mapping, ex-situ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electrochemical characterization techniques. [52] Specifically, at the beginning of Na insertion, Na + adsorb on defects of hard carbon which contributes to sloping voltage profiles.Different forms of carbon-based materials, including graphite-based carbon, graphene, soft and hard carbons, have been investigated as anode materials in SIBs.

        <p>During the hydrothermal process, the dewatered sugar (semi-fluid) was isolated out from water and formed an aqueous emulsion under high temperature and high pressure. [56] The excessive amount of dewatered sugar led to the formation of tiny particles, consisting of nuclei-oligomers within micelle, and finally formed carbon nanospheres after the complete consumption of sugar. The XRD pattern and Raman spectra, presented in Fig. 4b-d, indicate that the degree of the disorder increased with the increasing carbonization temperature, which seems counter-intuitive. It has been reported that the growth and orientation of graphite domains increase with the increasing annealing temperature.

[60][61][62][63] It exhibits high specific surface area, continuous electron conduction path and the ability to sustain volumetric changes during charge/discharge process. [64] Yang et al. [65] fabricated N-doped carbon nanosheets by using okara as a carbon precursor, which contains protein, fat, fiber and a high N content (~9.89%). The carbonized okara was exfoliated to enhance the interlayer distance between carbon nanosheets and achieve a high specific surface area. When used as an anode material in a full SIB, N-doped carbon nanosheets delivered a high energy density of 146.1 Wh kg -1 , which is much higher than most of the SIBs reported previously. [66,67,68] Moreover, the stable discharge capacity of N-doped carbon nanosheets, with a mass loading of 1.40, 2.29, 4.56, 7.52 mg cm -2 , was found to be 247.5, 191.5, 141.7, and 121.7 mAh g -1 , respectively. These results show that N-doped carbon nanosheets meet the requirements for practical applications. Wang et al. [69] obtained a carbon nanosheet via pyrolyzing peanut skin.

N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherms indicated that the carbon nanosheets possesses a high specific surface area (2070 m 2 g -1 ) as well as hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous. When employed as anode for SIBs, it delivered an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 461 mAh g -1 at 0.1 A g -1 and promising rate performance.

        <p>3D porous structures are promising electrode materials for LIBs and SIBs [70,71,72] due to their high specific surface area and interconnected porous structure, providing a large number of electrolyte diffusion channels and reducing the diffusion distance of Na ions. Zhu et al. [72] synthesized porous hard carbons from waste apricot shells by carbonization.

The hard carbons carbonized at 1300 ℃ exhibited a specific capacity of 400 mAh g -1 and an ICE of 79%. It is noted that H 2 reduction decreased the oxygen concentration and surface defects. In addition, the capacity plateau was not seen at a rate up to 4C, indicating that moderate defects are beneficial to the rapid diffusion of Na ions within the anode material. In addition, Hu et al. [73] obtained block-like hard carbon from a corn cob (HCC) via direct carbonization, as shown in bent layers. [74] Moreover, a large number of nanovoids (i.e. pores) within the carbon were observed with increasing heat treatment temperature, which was ascribed to a decreasing defect concentration, heteroatom doping and the rearrangement of carbon atoms, leading to a higher concentration of Na adsorption sites. Furthermore, HCC-derived carbon, carbonized at 1300 ℃, exhibited a specific capacity of 275 mAh g -1 and excellent cyclic stability with a capacity retention of 97% after 1000 cycles.

        <p>A large number of studies have reported that higher graphitization degree and fewer defects in hard carbon can reduce the formation of "dead sodium", which significantly lowers the 1 st cycle irreversible capacity loss.

        <p>SICs, a kind of hybrid ion capacitors (HICs), offer battery-like energy density and supercapacitor-like power density and cyclic performance. As shown in Fig. 10a, SICs are usually composed of a non-faradaic material, a separator and a faradaic electrode material. [96][97][98][99][100] In a typical SIC, Na ions migrate to the anode during charging while electrolyte anions shift and adsorb to the cathode surface. [101] In the subsequent discharge process, they return back to the electrolyte. Both SIBs and SICs exhibit similar charge storage mechanism, which is based on faradic reactions of the active electrode materials. [102] However, the charge storage mechanism of SIBs is limited by the cation diffusion within the crystalline framework of the electrochemically active electrode material, whereas redox reactions occur only at the surface of the electrode material in SICs. According to the classification of capacitive electrodes, SICs can be termed as pseudocapacitors because the anode material exhibits pseudocapacitive behavior. [103] In the case of pseudocapacitance, the charge storage mainly originates from the electron-transfer mechanism rather than the adsorption of ions, i.e., EDLC behavior. [ 104 ] Three different faradaic mechanisms are responsible for electrochemical capacitive features: underpotential deposition, redox pseudocapacitance and intercalation pseudocapacitance. In the case of underpotential deposition, the ions are deposited on the metal-electrolyte interface when the potential is lower than the equilibrium potential for cation reduction. [103,105] As for redox pseudocapacitance, the charge storage occurs via redox reactions of adsorbed ions, which are accompanied by fast and reversible electron transfer across the electrode-electrolyte interface. [103,106] Lastly, the intercalation pseudocapacitance corresponds to the intercalation of active ions in a redox-active material without any phase transition. [107,108] Recent studies suggest that some battery-type electrode materials with nanostructures might exhibit a faster charge/discharge rate compared to those without nanostructures, and capacitor-type electrode materials demonstrate improved capacitance with an increased outer surface area. [102][103][104][105][106][107][108][109][110][111] Therefore, several battery-type electrode materials showing faradaic behavior have been considered as pseudocapacitive electrodes, [ 112 , 113 ] which led to a fundamental confusion about pseudocapacitance. On the other hand, a number of studies reported that several electrode materials exhibit pseudocapacitive behavior during Li + /Na + insertion, but the charge storage within the crystalline framework was not determined by the Li + or Na + diffusion process. [102,[114][115][116][117][118][119][120][121][122] These devices are a combination of the typical faradaic behavior of battery-type electrodes and pseudocapacitive behavior of capacitor-type electrodes, causing further confusion and indicates that the pseudocapacitance mechanism requires further investigation.SICs, a kind of hybrid ion capacitors (HICs), offer battery-like energy density and supercapacitor-like power density and cyclic performance.

[103,105] As for redox pseudocapacitance, the charge storage occurs via redox reactions of adsorbed ions, which are accompanied by fast and reversible electron transfer across the electrode-electrolyte interface. [103,106] Lastly, the intercalation pseudocapacitance corresponds to the intercalation of active ions in a redox-active material without any phase transition. [107,108] Recent studies suggest that some battery-type electrode materials with nanostructures might exhibit a faster charge/discharge rate compared to those without nanostructures, and capacitor-type electrode materials demonstrate improved capacitance with an increased outer surface area. [102][103][104][105][106][107][108][109][110][111] Therefore, several battery-type electrode materials showing faradaic behavior have been considered as pseudocapacitive electrodes, [ 112 , 113 ] which led to a fundamental confusion about pseudocapacitance. On the other hand, a number of studies reported that several electrode materials exhibit pseudocapacitive behavior during Li + /Na + insertion, but the charge storage within the crystalline framework was not determined by the Li + or Na + diffusion process. [102,[114][115][116][117][118][119][120][121][122] These devices are a combination of the typical faradaic behavior of battery-type electrodes and pseudocapacitive behavior of capacitor-type electrodes, causing further confusion and indicates that the pseudocapacitance mechanism requires further investigation.</p>

[ 123 -127 ] The short ionic and electronic transport path gives rise to high power density, while the charge storage capacity is improved by the insertion of ions into graphitic crystallites. In addition, the carbon nanomaterials exhibit pseudocapacitive behavior, which further increases their power density. [128] Yun et al.

XPS characterization revealed the presence of oxygen and oxygen-/nitrogen-containing functional groups. It can be explained that the heteroatoms played a critical role in the formation of a thermostable conjugated structure below 300 ℃. Moreover, the surface functional groups remained attached to the carbon surface even after carbonization at 1200 ℃. The CV curves of HP-CNWs exhibited a linear increase in voltage between 0.1 and 1.5 V (vs. Na + /Na), which indicated the pseudocapacitive Na-ion storage on topological defect sites of hexagonal carbon layers.

Therefore, to utilize the catalytic effect of impurities and prevent its disadvantages, it might be sensible to remove the impurities after carbonization.Furthermore, some impurity containing transition metal can serve as graphitization catalysts during carbonization. Hoekstra et al. [157] reported that the iron nanoparticles catalyze the conversion of the amorphous carbon to graphitic carbon nanostructures. For SIBs and SICs, this change increases the conductivity and enhances the performance of carbonaceous material. Therefore, to utilize the catalytic effect of impurities and prevent its disadvantages, it might be sensible to remove the impurities after carbonization.</p>
        <p>Possibly an even more challenging aspect is the large variation of organic composition (and thus morphology) in biomass of the same species but grown in different conditions. There are various organic components including the low oxygen ones such as lipids, lignin, the high-oxygen ones including hemicellulose and cellulose as well as the heteroatomic compounds like chitin and phycocolloids. These uniform carbonization behavior of the undividual biopolymer than the crude fungus complex. [21] More recently, Feng et al. [160] proposed a process to produce high-performance hard carbon materials for SIBs via manipulating the component in different plant biomass. They removed non-lignocellulose (such as proteins, minerals, starch, etc) and hemicellulose from three type of biomass including Brewer's spent grain, grape pomace and walnut shells via chemical-enzymatic fractionation process in aicd solution to product acid detergent fibers (ADFs). The hard carbons derived from these ADFs all displayed excellent electrochemical properties. The simultaneous absence of non-lignocellulose and hemicellulose led to expanded (002) interlayer spacing which enhanced the specific capacity remarkably. This study provides a feasible method to prepare biomass-carbon with high consistence.Possibly an even more challenging aspect is the large variation of organic composition (and thus morphology) in biomass of the same species but grown in different conditions.

        <p>Bio-refinery, a concept of converting biomass into industrial commodity producets, might be another feasible method for transferring various biomass into carbonaceous materials with commercial viability. [ 161 ] Previous reports have already discussed the potential products such as biofuels, biochemicals, and bio-based materials synthesized from lignocellulosic biomass by thermochemical, biochemical and chemical processes. [162][163][164][165] Similarly, with some suitable biochemical technologies, biomass could also be transformed from low-cost biomass into various useful resources. It provides a guidance to design effective convertion processes for the selective production of useful chemical which can be utilized for synthesizing high-preformance electrode materials for sodium storage.Bio-refinery, a concept of converting biomass into industrial commodity producets, might be another feasible method for transferring various biomass into carbonaceous materials with commercial viability.
