        <p>Large optical anisotropy observed in a broad spectral range is of paramount importance for efficient light manipulation in countless devices. Although a giant anisotropy has been recently observed in the mid-infrared wavelength range, for visible and near-infrared spectral intervals, the problem remains acute with the highest reported birefringence values of 0.8 in BaTiS 3 and h-BN crystals. This issue inspired an intensive search for giant optical anisotropy among natural and artificial materials. Here, we demonstrate that layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) provide an answer to this quest owing to their fundamental differences between intralayer strong covalent bonding and weak interlayer van der Waals interaction. To do this, we made correlative far-and near-field characterizations validated by first-principle calculations that reveal a huge birefringence of 1.5 in the infrared and 3 in the visible light for MoS 2 . Our findings demonstrate that this remarkable anisotropy allows for tackling the diffraction limit enabling an avenue for on-chip next-generation photonics.Large optical anisotropy observed in a broad spectral range is of paramount importance for efficient light manipulation in countless devices.

        <p>O ptical anisotropy plays a crucial role in light manipulation owing to birefringence phenomena, namely, doubling the incoming light into two different rays (called ordinary and extraordinary for uniaxial optical materials). It results in spatial and polarization separation 1 , through versatile optical components [2][3][4] , including polarizers, wave plates, multilayer mirrors, and phase-matching elements. The performance of these devices primarily depends on the phase retardance (φ) between ordinary and extraordinary rays, which is proportional to the thickness (d) of the device and the birefringence (Δn) of the constituting materials. Thus, a large birefringence is very favorable and beneficial since it leads to more compact and efficient devices. Despite its great importance for high-performance optics, the currently used materials such as inorganic solids and liquid crystals possess a relatively small birefringence with typical values below 0.4 [5][6][7][8][9] . Even the record-holders quasi-one-dimensional BaTiS 3 and layered h-BN crystals improve this result by less than twofold (Δn ~0.8) 10,11 . The problem is partially solved in the mid-infrared range by large anisotropy in the biaxial van der Waals (vdW) crystals α-MoO 3 and α-V 2 O 5 12,13 . Still, these materials become mostly isotropic in the visible and near-infrared light. Meanwhile, artificial design can offer large birefringence in metamaterials and metasurfaces 14 . However, its widespread usage is impeded by optical losses and fabrication challenges.O ptical anisotropy plays a crucial role in light manipulation owing to birefringence phenomena, namely, doubling the incoming light into two different rays (called ordinary and extraordinary for uniaxial optical materials).

        <p>As a result, natural materials with giant anisotropy (Δn &gt; 1) are in growing demand both for scientific and industrial purposes. In this regard, transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) in a bulk configuration are promising candidates because of their strongly anisotropic vdW structure, which naturally leads to a large intrinsic birefringence. In particular, while MoS 2 solids adopt an in-plane crystalline layered structure through strong ionic/covalent bonds between molybdenum (Mo) and sulfur (S) atoms, the out-of-plane link of these layers occurs via weak vdW forces in trigonal prismatic configuration 15 , as illustrated in Fig. 1a.As a result, natural materials with giant anisotropy (Δn &gt; 1) are in growing demand both for scientific and industrial purposes.

        <p>As a consequence, a strong optical anisotropy emerges in TMDCs. A diagonal permittivity tensor can describe it with two optical constants corresponding to the crystallographic ab-plane and the c-axis 16 . Interestingly, these anisotropic properties of TMDCs were qualitatively demonstrated back in 1967 by Liang et al. 17 , but only currently attracted significant importance in experiments dealing with novel regimes of light-matter interactions 18,19 comprising exciton-polariton transport 20 , Zenneck surface waves 21 , tunable modal birefringence 22 , and anapole-exciton polaritons 23 . Although a recent pioneering work by Hu et al. 16 reported a birefringence value of Δn = 1.4 for MoS 2 at λ = 1530 nm, the values of asymmetric dielectric responses of MoS 2 in a wide wavelength interval have so far remained unknown. It most likely stems from inherent experimental difficulties while measuring a high refractive index of anisotropic materials that we overcome here by joining together far and near-field characterization techniques. The method allows us to obtain the full dielectric tensor in a wide wavelength range (360-1700 nm) and reveals giant birefringence for MoS 2 as high as Δn ~1.5 in the infrared and Δn ~3 in the visible spectra. This outstandingly large optical anisotropy accompanied by a high refractive index n ~4 paves a way for highly efficient optics and light manipulation in photonic chips. the hardest parts is the implementation of traditional spectroscopic diffraction-limited characterization techniques, including transmittance, reflectance, and ellipsometry measurements, since bulk TMDCs are usually prepared by the exfoliation method, as a result, the samples obtained have lateral dimensions of tens of micrometers. A second difficulty is related to the measured signal's low-sensitivity to the out-of-plane components attributed to a large in-plane refractive index n ~4. For instance, in the ellipsometry configuration, incident light at 80°gives the refraction angle of only 14.3°, according to the Snell's law, which implies that the probed electric field of the refracted light mainly lies along the layers and thus, is almost insensitive to the out-ofplane dielectric component.As a consequence, a strong optical anisotropy emerges in TMDCs.

        <p>To overcome the latter, we prepared exfoliated thin MoS 2 films on 285 nm SiO 2 /Si substrate and verified their 2H semiconducting configuration by the resonant Raman demonstrated in the inset of Fig. 1a since MoS 2 exists in nature in three phase modifications (see details in Supplementary Note 1): semiconducting (2H and 3R) and metallic (1T) 24 . The thick layer of silicon oxide will produce an interference-like pattern for ordinary and extraordinary beams that can readily be detected employing phase-sensitive techniques such as spectroscopic ellipsometry. For this reason, we performed imaging spectroscopic ellipsometry (ISE) measurements in the 360-1700 nm wavelength range, given that it allows measuring samples down to several micrometers since it is a hybrid of ellipsometer and microscope ("Methods"). It allowed us to record the ellipsometry signal Ψ and Δ ("Methods") from several regions of interest (ROI) of the flakes within the selected field of view, as indicated in Fig. 1b. As a result, multiple sample analysis was implemented to increase data reliability (see Supplementary Note 2). The resulting ellipsometry spectra in Fig. 1c show a pronounced asymmetrical interference-like peak at around 900 nm (see details in Supplementary Note 3). This is induced by a large phase difference between ordinary and extraordinary beams, indicating (without any modeling of the experimental curves) large birefringence stemming from a strong anisotropy between the c-axis and the ab-plane.To overcome the latter, we prepared exfoliated thin MoS 2 films on 285 nm SiO 2 /Si substrate and verified their 2H semiconducting configuration by the resonant Raman demonstrated in the inset of Fig. 1a since MoS 2 exists in nature in three phase modifications (see details in Supplementary Note 1): semiconducting (2H and 3R) and metallic (1T) 24 .

        <p>Notwithstanding the noticeable anisotropic feature at 900 nm in the measured spectra, to accurately retrieve the complete dielectric tensor of MoS 2 and enable predictive capabilities for future advanced optical devices using this material, it is imperative to develop an accurate dielectric function model. In that case, the best route towards a dielectric description is to utilize the crystallographic features of MoS 2 . Briefly, in its 2H structure consecutive layers are linked by weak vdW forces and rotated by 180°with respect to each other leading to a strong suppression of interlayer hopping for both electrons and holes, and, thus, preventing the formation of tightly bound interlayer electron-hole pair upon light illumination, the so-called excitons 25,26 . Therefore, along the c-axis, the material is transparent, and a Cauchy model describes its dielectric response (see Supplementary Note 2), which is an evident consequence of the Kramers-Kronig relation between real (n) and imaginary (k) parts of the refractive index and material transparency. In contrast, the confinement of electrons and holes within the layer results in enormous binding energy (~50 meV) for intralayer A-and B-excitons at the visible range similar to its monolayer counterpart 27 . At the same time, it supports C and C' exciton complexes at ultraviolet wavelengths due to the nest banding effects and complex atomic orbital contributions 28 . The Tauc-Lorentz oscillator model best describes this excitonic behavior for the ab-plane (see Supplementary Note 2) because it captures two of the most essential physical features: 29 (i) at low photon energies, excitons cannot be excited, as a consequence, absorption, or equivalently the imaginary part of refractive index (k), is equal to zero in this wavelength range and (ii) excitonic peaks exhibit an asymmetric shape due to phonon coupling of bright (excited by light) and dark (not excited by light) excitons.Notwithstanding the noticeable anisotropic feature at 900 nm in the measured spectra, to accurately retrieve the complete dielectric tensor of MoS 2 and enable predictive capabilities for future advanced optical devices using this material, it is imperative to develop an accurate dielectric function model.

        <p>Using these models for describing the optical properties of MoS 2 , we fitted the experimentally measured ellipsometric parameters Ψ and Δ for both ROIs at the same time (see Supplementary Note 2). The resulting ordinary (along the layers) and extraordinary (perpendicular to the layers) optical constants and birefringence are displayed in Fig. 2a. These constants have a surprisingly well match with the values predicted by the firstprinciple calculations (see "Methods" and Supplementary Note 4). As expected, the material along the c-axis is transparent, even at ultraviolet and visible wavelengths. It confirms that excitons are formed in the layers providing a dichroic window from ~900 nm where the absorption of both ordinary and extraordinary light becomes negligible. Of immediate interest is the giant birefringence of Δn ~1.5 in the infrared and Δn ~3 in the visible ranges, which can serve as a platform for optical engineering in creating devices for the photonic application. As compared in Fig. 2c, the birefringence obtained for MoS 2 in the visible and near-infrared spectral intervals is several times larger than for previous recordholders BaTiS 3 and h-BN 10,11 , and an order of magnitude exceeding the values of currently used birefringent materials. Particular attention should also be given to the absolute values of the refractive indices, specifically their in-plane component. The high value of ~4.1 is comparable with traditionally used isotropic high-refractive-index semiconductors 30 , including Si (~3.6) 31 , GaAs (~3.5) 32 , and GaSb (~3.9) 33 as illustrated in Fig. 2b. Such a large refractive index for MoS 2 opens the door for lossless subwavelength photonics with the resolution of ~100 nm, which can easily rival with plasmonics platform, yet does not suffer from losses.Using these models for describing the optical properties of MoS 2 , we fitted the experimentally measured ellipsometric parameters Ψ and Δ for both ROIs at the same time (see Supplementary Note 2).

        <p>Furthermore, as we do not specify particular properties of MoS 2 other than its in-plane excitonic nature and the out-ofplane transparency, our conclusions are quite general and can be applied to equally well to other semiconductor members of layered TMDCs with hexagonal, tetragonal, and trigonal atomic structure 1 . Consequently, we anticipate that other TMDCs with a hexagonal configuration also exhibit giant anisotropy because of the similarity in the crystal structure. In fact, the refractive index depends on the density of atoms in the crystal. As a consequence, one could expect that the larger the distance between the layers, the higher the birefringence value between in-plane and out-ofplane dielectric responses. Indeed, a comparison of their lattice parameters normalized to the distance between chalcogen intercore distances in the inset of Fig. 2b explains the giant anisotropy in MoS 2 and forecasts similar (or even higher) birefringence values for MoSe 2 , WS 2 , WSe 2 , and MoTe 2 .Furthermore, as we do not specify particular properties of MoS 2 other than its in-plane excitonic nature and the out-ofplane transparency, our conclusions are quite general and can be applied to equally well to other semiconductor members of layered TMDCs with hexagonal, tetragonal, and trigonal atomic structure 1 .

        <p>For an unambiguous validation of the extracted dielectric function, we analyzed the planar transverse magnetic (TM) waveguide modes propagating in MoS 2 flakes employing a scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscope (s-SNOM, "Methods"). By recording the scattered radiation, nanoscale images corresponding to the field distribution associated with the guided mode is obtained (Fig. 3a,b).

        <p>The resulting FT has two pronounced peaks: one around zero due to background originating mostly from a strong tip-sample coupling. The second is associated with the planar TM-waveguide mode of interest. Note that there are no peaks in the left part of Fig. 3e (for negative values of q), indicating that no modes propagate in the backward direction (from the edge to the tip). The latter implies that mode scattering by the edge is far more efficient than the mode edge reflection or launching. Otherwise, we would observe standing waves with a cosine form, whose FT would be symmetrical and which are predominantly observed in nanoinfrared imaging of graphene plasmons 35,36 and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) polaritons 37 . The primary reason for the observed tip-launching and edge-scattering mechanisms is the relatively small momenta of the modes 20 since it is much closer to the freespace photon wavevector (k 0 ) than in the studies of graphene 35,36 or hBN 37 .

The obtained experimental (q, E) data points (green triangles) are overlaid on top of the calculated dispersion color map in Fig. 4a using constants from Fig. 2a. For reference, we also added the dispersion for an isotropic model in Fig. 4b, assuming the optical constants to be the same for all crystallographic axes and equal one from the ab-plane. Notably, in the visible spectral range, where excitons start playing a role, the isotropic model (Fig. 4b) predicts the absence of guided modes owing to high material absorption. Conversely, our anisotropic results and near-field measurements reveal that even for this spectral interval, guided modes exist, which explains the recently discovered excitons polaritons in TMDCs 20 . Therefore, the excellent agreement between the experiment and theory validates our dielectric permittivity of MoS 2 , allowing for predicting capabilities in future photonic devices, including polarization-maintaining fibers 4 and polarization tunable Mie-nanoresonators for nonlinear photonics 38 since the magnetic dipole (MD) Mie-resonance in MoS 2 nanoparticles is strongly affected by the refractive index values 39 . For instance, the spectral position of MD-resonance for a spherical particle is approximately defined by λ MD ≈ nD, with D being the sphere's diameter 40 . Besides, its anisotropic behavior allows its use as nanoresonators even for photon energies higher than the electronic bandgap thanks to the absence of absorption along the c-axis. At the same time, for conventional isotropic materials (c-Si, GaAs, and GaSb) this option is closed.

In this regard, the extreme skin-depth (e-skid) waveguide in Fig. 5 epitomizes the importance of a highly anisotropic material as an essential building block for next-generation photonics 41 . This phenomenon originates from the general law of total internal reflection (TIR). In the classical case, if n 2 &gt; n 1 , where n 1 and n 2 are the refractive indices of the medium 1 and 2 in Fig. 5a, and the incident angle is greater than the critical angle, light is reflected in the second medium and decays in the first. This effect is in the core of telecommunication technologies for guiding light at vast distances since light reflects without power loss. However, reducing the thickness of standard (typically Si) optical waveguides down to the nanometric scale introduces a considerable difficulty. As illustrated in Fig. 5a, b and e, f, the electromagnetic mode confinement in the optically less dense material significantly weakens. It restricts photonic integrated circuit miniaturization because of the cross-talk (electric field overlapping between adjacent waveguides) 42 . The solution to the problem is a generalized TIR form, which relaxes the condition n 2 &gt; n 1 to n 2 &gt; n c (Fig. 5c), where n c is the out-of-plane refractive index of the first anisotropic medium 43 . Counterintuitively, the in-plane refractive index n ab could have any value even higher than n 2 . More interestingly, the greater n ab , the better the light confinement inside the waveguide core (Fig. 5d), allowing us to get closer to the diffraction limit λ/2n core , where λ is the wavelength of light and n core is the refractive index of the waveguide core. To experimentally demonstrate the effect, we covered a 285 nm-thick MoS 2 flake with 190 nm-thick silicon ("Methods") to form a planar e-skid waveguide Air/Si/MoS 2 . Although MoS 2 is better than air for light confinement, we left one of the silicon slab faces uncovered to visualize the mode by near-field measurements shown in Fig. 5i-l. The waveguiding mode measured dispersion is in close agreement with the theoretical calculations, thus validating the e-skid waveguide concept for light confinement and, consequently, miniaturized photonic integrated circuits. It is worth mentioning that MoS 2 yields markedly better light confinement than recently introduced metamaterial 41 of alternating layers of Si and SiO 2 (Fig. 5f) since MoS 2 is a natural metamaterial with molybdenum, sulfur, and vdW gap varying layers (Fig. 5c,d). Finally, the proposed approach leads to another concept of a vertical integrated circuit, which has been recently proved to provide a useful degree of freedom for efficient light manipulation 44 .Extreme skin-depth waveguides based on giant anisotropy in MoS 2 .

        <p>Optical anisotropy lies behind the functionality of many optical devices such as polarizers and wave plates, to name a few. This phenomenon's importance calls for active investigation of anisotropic materials to expand their application scope. However, the apparatus efficiency and compactness mostly depend on absolute birefringence values, which are moderate with the best result (Δn &lt; 0.8), reported in h-BN and BaTiS 3 crystals in the visible and near-infrared ranges. We believe that these limitations can be outperformed by the family of TMDCs materials, whose inherent intralayer excitonic behavior results in large anisotropy along and perpendicular to the layers. To validate the concept, we showed a giant (Δn &gt; 1.5) broadband anisotropy for MoS 2 employing far and near-field techniques. Additionally, we demonstrated its applicability for on-chip sub-duffraction optics. From a wider perspective, our result provides a path for nextgeneration nanophotonics based on TMDCs, for example, in tunable Mie-nanoresonators, and exciton-polariton physics.Optical anisotropy lies behind the functionality of many optical devices such as polarizers and wave plates, to name a few.

The s-SNOM is based on a tapping-mode AFM illuminated by a monochromatic tunable laser of the wavelength from 1470-1570 nm spectral interval or He-Ne laser with the wavelength 632.8 nm. The near-field images were registered by pseudo-heterodyne interferometric module with tip-tapping frequency around 270 kHz with an amplitude of about 40 nm. The noise was significantly suppressed by demodulating the optical signal with a pseudo-heterodyne interferometer at high harmonics, nΩ (in our case third harmonics).Near-field optical nano-spectroscopy.
