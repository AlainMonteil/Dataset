        <p>Titanium (Ti) and its alloys, namely the most popular one Ti-6Al-4V alloy, have rapidly evolved to become one of the most important high-end materials in a variety of industrial applications such as aerospace, biomedical, and power/energy sectors. [1,2]. This is associated with its excellent corrosion resistance and specific strength, the highest of all metallic elements, as well as low density [3], along with good specific strength at a high-temperature level. Ti-6Al-4V alloy is extremely difficult-to-machine. Titanium and its alloys offered complex and unusual deformation mechanism under extemre working conditions, including the thermal softening property at high temperatures, compared to other commonly available metals such as steel or aluminium [4]. This drawback, coupled with the fact that Ti-alloys have low thermal conductivity and low volume specific heat, results in high cutting temperature [5]. The high temperature causes build-up edge which accelerate tool-wear [4]. Therefore, various attempts have been made in recent decades to develop advanced AM processes for Ti-alloys as alternative manufacturing process.Titanium (Ti) and its alloys, namely the most popular one Ti-6Al-4V alloy, have rapidly evolved to become one of the most important high-end materials in a variety of industrial applications such as aerospace, biomedical, and power/energy sectors.

        <p>In traditionally known additive manufacturing (AM), a product is designed, modelled and generated by computer-aided design (CAD) method, then is sliced into multiple thin layers. and built layer by layer from bottom to top using a heat source such as laser, electron beam or ultrasonication to melt and combine materials [6]. As such, from the economical point of view, AM consumes the minimum quantity of materials in net-shape with the significant conservation of resources and consumables. AM techniques have significantly lower manufacturing time when compared with conventional methods due to the fact that many steps in the current conventional methods such as melting, forming, shaping, moulding as well as machining, can be skipped with AM. As AM is capable of fabricating near-net shapes [6], minimal machining is required to achieve good surface finish and shape. AM technologies enable producing a part composed of multi-material such as the reinforcements of pure Ti with J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f SiC [119], TiB2 [120], hydroxyapatite [121,122], Si3N4 [123], and Ti-6Al-4V with Cu [124,125]. Co-Cr-Mo coated on Ti-6Al-4V [126] and TiO2 coated on pure Ti [127] using AM technologies may feasibly improve wear resistance of metal on metal implants in biomedical applications.In traditionally known additive manufacturing (AM), a product is designed, modelled and generated by computer-aided design (CAD) method, then is sliced into multiple thin layers. and built layer by layer from bottom to top using a heat source such as laser, electron beam or ultrasonication to melt and combine materials [6].

        <p>A significant amount research work in this field has been reported in the published literatures [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17]. Nonetheless, it is difficult to have a good understanding of this field due to somewhat disorganised or less linked scientific results. This current review investigates the latest developments in the AM of titanium alloys available in previous studies and investigations, and links the findings from the prior work more scientifically with the comprehensive overview of material and product developement efforts. This ensures that the associated limimations and drawbacks, as well as precautions can be substantiated to benefit industrialists and researchers in meeting the future challenges in the AM of Ti-6Al-4V alloy.A significant amount research work in this field has been reported in the published literatures [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17].

        <p>American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has classified AM into seven process categories [1,6] including (i) vat photopolymerization (VP), (ii) powder bed fusion (PBF), (iii) directed energy deposition (DED), (iv) material extrusion (ME), (v) material jetting (MJ), (vi) binder jetting (BJ) and (vii) sheet lamination (SL). Among these, only PBF, DED and SL have been applied in additive manufacturing of Ti and its alloys [1]. Powder bed fusion is an AM technique that utilizes a heat source (e.g. laser, plasma, electron beam, etc.) to melt and combine powder material in order to follow the tool path configuration specified in the CAD file in a layer-by-layer manner. Once each layer is produced, a new powder layer is spread over and the process repeats until the end. The entire process is highly capable of producing near J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f net-shape products [18]. Directed energy deposition is an AM technology with the aid of a focused heat source (laser or electron beam) to melt material (in the form of either powders or wires) when deposited through a nozzle. The main difference between DED and PBF is that PBF melt the material before it is being deposited while the melting process in DED takes place while it is being deposited [6,7]. The part fabricated rests on a baseplate by moving the head according to the CAD/CAM plans developed [19]. Sheet lamination is an AM process where material sheets are bonded together using adhesives, and a guided laser following the tool path data cuts the sheets into a desired shape. A new material sheet is then added, and the process repeats until the product is finished. The two types of sheet lamination are categorized as "bond then form" (sheets are bonded first then cut to shape) and "form then bond" (sheets are cut to shape first then bond). These two types have some differences despite the same major process principles [6].American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has classified AM into seven process categories [1,6] including (i) vat photopolymerization (VP), (ii) powder bed fusion (PBF), (iii) directed energy deposition (DED), (iv) material extrusion (ME), (v) material jetting (MJ), (vi) binder jetting (BJ) and (vii) sheet lamination (SL).

        <p>Commercially available AM technologies utilize either electron beam, laser or ultrasonication as their heat sources to melt and weld powder materials [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17]. Electron beam-based technologies are operated in a vacuum environment as opposed to laser-based counterparts in an inert atmosphere environment. While inert atmosphere system is cheaper than vacuum system, they have the typical downside in relation to greater residual stress with the requirement of a stress relieving operation [1]. A comparison of PBF, DED and SL technologies involved in the AM of Ti-alloys with their respective work principles are summarized in Table 1.Commercially available AM technologies utilize either electron beam, laser or ultrasonication as their heat sources to melt and weld powder materials [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17].

        <p>PBF technologies are capable of building parts with complex, unusual geometries and features with high accuracy coupled with good surface finish. However, when compared to DED technologies, PBF technologies are limited to build size, single material build, slow build rate, and therefore cannot build additional features on existing parts. In contrast, DED technologies generally build less complicated parts in possession of rougher surface finish as opposed to PBF. On the other hand, DED technologies allow for large and flexible build size. DMD technology is capable of building multi-materials parts in a medium or large size with the provision of considerable advantages over conventional PBF technologies [15]. In addition, DED technologies also yield a higher deposition rate leading to an increase in the build rate.PBF technologies are capable of building parts with complex, unusual geometries and features with high accuracy coupled with good surface finish.

        <p>The AM of Ti-6Al-4V alloy uses pre-alloyed titanium powders as feeding material. Layer thickness as well as minimum buildable size and surface quality of the products depend primarily on the size and shape of powder particles. Additionally, powder size distribution also affects the packing density of PBF processes. The size of powders for PBF processes generally range from 20 -40 μm in contrast with 45 -150 μm for DED processes [1]. Depending on the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f powder preparation process, the particles can vary, typically in irregular, needle-like, flakelike, granular, platelet-like shapes, etc., [1,20]. However, powder morphology (shape and size) is less important in DED techniques. A consistent flow of powder is essential to warrant successful operation and product quality. Spherical shape powder without any unusual morphology and contamination is highly recommended to achieve a good and consistent flow rate [1,21]. Generally, 100% pure metal powders are difficult to obtain and additives are required to ensure the fidelity of the powders in most cases. Chemical properties of powders may also vary due to the repeated operations in AM or recycling as the prolonged exposure of thermal effects from multiple build layers can result in the losses of elements [20]. For example, electron beam melting of Ti-6Al-4V powders in a vacuum environment can lead to the loss of Al elements. As such, the additional amount of Al is often added to compensate the loss. The powder density directly affects the porosity where more denser powder is particularly preferred to reduce the porosity which influences properties of the final product accordigly [1] [22].The AM of Ti-6Al-4V alloy uses pre-alloyed titanium powders as feeding material.

        <p>This complexity in thermal history makes it difficult to characterize prior β grains [26]. Fig. 1 demonstrates the temperatures of different layers for an AM-produced sample in terms of time or layer number. The temperature of the first layer is above the melting point (i.e. liquidus temperature). It remains above the melting point at the time when the second layer is added.This complexity in thermal history makes it difficult to characterize prior β grains [26].

        <p>The first layer's temperature drops but still remains above the transus β temperature up to the addition of the fourth layer. The size and thickness of prior β grains do not depend on cooling rate, as explained in the case of α laths, but rather the period between transus β temperature and melting point [27]. This results in the formation of characteristics columnar β grains in the microstructures of all AM-processed Ti-6Al-4V alloy [23,27,29]. Formanoir et al. [30], Al-Bermani et al. [31] and Liu and Shin [23] stated that β grains nucleate and grow epitaxially on the top surface of previous layers and perpendicular to the molten pool. The size of β grains varies a lot between J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f each AM process. Wu et al. [32] reported a thickness range of 0.2 -4 mm for β grains. Sandgren et al. [33] found the prior β grain thickness up to 4 mm for the DED process. Both Lancaster et al. [34] and Simonelli et al. [35] reported the thickness values of 246 and 103 μm for prior β grains in EBM and SLM processes, respectively. Generally, DED processes can spot larger prior β grain size than those of PBF (EBM, SLM). According to Liu et al [31], Ti-6Al-4V alloys undergo a complete melting and solidification process during the AM process, which are transformed from α + β (i.e., initial phase of the alloys at ambient temperature) to β due to very high temperature to liquid then back to β and finally to α + β/α′ when the temperature of the molten pool drops below transus β temperature. As such, a sufficient cooling rate, along with build temperature, lower than the martensite start temperature at 780 °C would be required for the formation of α′ martensite [23]. Martensite start temperature varies from 575 to 800 °C [36,37] which is due to the difference in initial microstructures and uniformity of composition and impurities. It is impossible for these factors to be the same throughout each specimen, thus it leads to different martensite start temperatures as reported in various tests [38][39][40]. Any cooling rate of 410 °C/s or higher results in complete α′ martensite formation. An incomplete α′ martensite formation is expected in cooling rate range of 410 to 20 °C/s.The first layer's temperature drops but still remains above the transus β temperature up to the addition of the fourth layer.

        <p>Though the core working principle is similar for all AM processes such as EBM, SLM and DED, those have different build temperatures and cooling rates. It is reported that the build temperature of EBM is roughly in the range of 600 -760 °C [41,42], which is higher than those of SLM and DED. Significantly high build temperature and fast cooling rate take place in these processes as concentrated energy beam is used in these methods for a very short time.Though the core working principle is similar for all AM processes such as EBM, SLM and DED, those have different build temperatures and cooling rates.

        <p>Cooling rate is expected to have a wide range even within the same AM process because of many affecting process parameters.

        <p>Initially, the molten pool cools down rapidly and the diffusion may occur for less transformation of β to martensite α′. Then, the temperature remains somewhat constant at the build temperature range of approximately 600-760 °C until the deposition process is completed. During this stage, the high build temperature of EBM process acts as an in-progress heat treatment resulting in the decomposition of martensite α′ to α + β phase [45][46][47][48]. According to Al-Bermani et al. [31], some martensite α′ can still be found within the larger parts produced by EBM. They exist in small parts or very close to the top surfaces where the high cooling rate occurs.

Therefore, these heat-treated Ti-6Al-4V alloys can lower yield strength, despit the improvement of ductility over as-built Ti-6Al-4V alloys via SLM and DED. However, it should be noted that additional heat treatment processes may incur extra production cost. The low scan speed increases the laser interaction time and high energy input which results in higher deposition temperature and lower cooling rate. This might annihilate the stress to some extent. The lower cooling rate of EBM (compare to SLM and DED) and its high build temperature facilitate inprogress heat treatment. Therfore, the average α lath thickness of EBM-produced parts is thicker than those of SLM and DED. The thicker the α lath, the less strength the alloy will sustain. As such, Laser PBF and DED parts are expected to achieve higher strength with lower ductility than those of EBM parts [56]. Since α lath thickness in parts produced from SLM and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f DED is smaller than that of EBM, parts produced from SLM and DED should have higher yield strength than EBM despite more poor ductility.

        <p>One of the key considerations for any AM-fabricated Ti-alloy products lies in whether they have the material properties to compete with those based upon conventionally produced counterparts such as forged, cast or wrought titanium.

Specifically, electron beam based PBF typically produce the parts with comparable or slightly superior strengths to that of conventionally produced parts. Meanwhile, laser-based PBF and DED technologies appear to produce parts with the superior strength as opposed to traditional methods, while laser-based PBF yields the highest strength. This can be expected based on the microstructural evolution of AM-made samples. The axis orientation of the build does not appear to induce significant effect on the part strength. This is because the strength discrepancies between the two directions XY (horizontal) and Z (longitudinal) are not high enough to influnence in most tests.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f According to Tables 3 and4, in can be seen that generally the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength of AM-fabricated Ti samples are comparable or superior to conventionally produced Ti alloy samples.

        <p>The effect of cooling rate, thus the effect of microstructure of AM-processed Ti samples affect the strength and ductility. The columnar α + β yields better strength than equiaxed α + β.

The formation of martensite α′ phase results from faster cooling rate but lower build temperature of laser-based and DED processes leading to either partial α′ or complete α′ transformation depending on different process parameters [1,23,24]. As illustrated in Tables 3 and4, the ductility of wrought and forged Ti-6Al-4V is superior to those from AM-fabricated couterparts.

Hot isostatic press (HIP) can potentially minimize pores and assist in generating the denser microstructure of the parts, which ultimately becomes favourable in improving the ductility of AM-built Ti parts.

Higher elongation at failure could be achieved for the heat treatment at higher temperature with an additional strength decrease. This must be considered when deciding whether the parts need extra ductility or strength, depending on its specific applications. In light of these, Ti parts produced by AM techniques have the strength required to perform in place of traditionally produced Ti counterparts.

        <p>The lack of fusion pores tend to be larger in size (500 μm or even more), possessing irregular shapes with sharp tips at the ends (Fig. 7), which are generally located at the boundary of two adjacent layers [87,88]. The formation of this type of pore is usually attributed to those metal powders that are not completely melted before being deposited as a new layer on the top of previous layer [89], as shown in Fig. 7, together with poor bonding defects. Such defects are caused by an insufficient melting of metal, thus resulting in poor bonding between layers during the solidification [90,91].

        <p>It has been detected that residual stresses are higher along the scan direction than those in the perpendicular direction due to the larger thermal gradient along the scan direction [16]. As such, an anisotropic stress distribution can be generated in the final parts [16,117]. Moreover, residual stresses also increase with the scan length [117,118]. It is well known that residual stresses contribute to the crack formation and warping in the part, leading to the disconnection of builds from the substrate and cracks in the finished parts [117,128]. These failures will always cause immediate and fatal consequences of impairing the geometrical accuracy and damaging the structures. Therefore, SLM and EBM built parts may require supporting structures to restrict bending or distortion during manufacturing processes. The residual strees was removed or reduced by suitable heat treatment process [115]. Systematically calculated residual stresses formed in single-track EBM Ti-6Al-4V by varying the pre-heating temperature of the fusion bed suggests that the bed pre-heating temperature has the most significant impact on the residual stress. Quantitatively, each increment by 50 °C in pre-heating temperature shows a stress reduction by 20 % approximately. The EBM process maintains a build temperature of 600-750 °C throughout the deposition [70][71][72]. Generally, it takes about 5 hours to achieve a complete stress relief at this temperature while EBM deposition cycles mostly run longer than 5 hours. Therefore, contrary to the DED and SLM processes, it is widely accepted that residual stresses can be negligible in the EBM process. For example, Honnige et al [45] utilized neutron scattering to measure residual stresses in EBM Ti6Al4V parts and did not find a significant level of residual stresses.

        <p>EBM parts have the lowest tensile strength, and further the lowest fatigue strength. When compared to conventionally produced Ti-6Al-4V parts, SLM produced components have somewhat similar fatigue strength to wrought and forged Ti with DED parts, which is followed by slightly lower strength of EBM parts comparable to that of cast Ti-6Al-4V. However, despite the comparable fatigue strength, AM produced Ti-6Al-4V parts do not seem to be able to achieve high fatigue toughness similar to those conventionally produced. This is due to the fact that the surface roughness of as-built AM-processed parts is generally worse compared to those produced traditionally. As the components produced by AM are plagued with pores in the as-built condition, heat treatment processes such as hot isostatic press can help improve the fatigue properties of AM-processed parts. Additionally, annealing can also be used to increase the fatigue toughness to achieve the high strength, low toughness in AM processes such as, SLM and DMLS. This is attributed to the decomposition of α′ martensite to increasing ductility [47]. As can be seen in Fig. 11, in the case of EBM-processed specimens, hot isostatic press significantly improved the fatigue properties of specimens, namely fatigue strength and to some extent, fatigue toughness. The effectiveness of hot isostatic press process is also confirmed by Seifi et al. [98]. As hot isostatic press process is known to induce positive effect on reducing the porosity as well as pore size, it is as expected that the fatigue properties of the specimen J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f would be improved after the HIP process. On the other hand, Hrabe et al. [92] did not notice any difference between the as-built and stress-relieved specimens. According to Chern et al. [104], as shown in Fig. 12, the horizontal builds appear to always yield better fatigue properties as opposed to vertical builds without any post processing.EBM parts have the lowest tensile strength, and further the lowest fatigue strength. When compared to conventionally produced Ti-6Al-4V parts, SLM produced components have somewhat similar fatigue strength to wrought and forged Ti with DED parts, which is followed by slightly lower strength of EBM parts comparable to that of cast Ti-6Al-4V. However, despite the comparable fatigue strength, AM produced Ti-6Al-4V parts do not seem to be able to achieve high fatigue toughness similar to those conventionally produced. This is due to the fact that the surface roughness of as-built AM-processed parts is generally worse compared to those produced traditionally. As the components produced by AM are plagued with pores in the as-built condition, heat treatment processes such as hot isostatic press can help improve the fatigue properties of AM-processed parts. Additionally, annealing can also be used to increase the fatigue toughness to achieve the high strength, low toughness in AM processes such as, SLM and DMLS. This is attributed to the decomposition of α′ martensite to increasing ductility [47].

        <p>PBF technologies are better for complex geometries with support for hollow, void structures owing to the smaller beam/layer size. On the other hand, DED with large beam size and thicker layer has lower accuracy, but much higher deposition and production rate relative to PBF. DED is also cheaper to produce per part according to a study conducted by Optomec [17]. Another advantage of DED over PBF and conventional methods is that reparation and reconfiguraration is possible for DED processes [128]. This may be one of the most unique advantages for DED technique. According to DM3D Technology [34], their closed-loop technology offers low heataffected zone. This minimal heat-affected zone is beneficial in repairing parts as this assists in retaining the properties of the parts. Repairing a part is not possible with PBF or via conventional methods such as wrought, cast or forge, and thus eliminate for the cost associated with remanufacturing. Moreover, DED technologies such as LENS, DMD or EBAM have the ability to add metals on to the surfaces of existing parts [128]. There is a considerable advantage of DED as such this capability is not available with PBF or conventional manufacturing J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f methods which provides great flexibility in the operation of DED. Adding extra features on existing parts can offer the most cost-effective option while remanufacturing parts with new builds using PBF or conventional methods would be required to start again from the beginning.PBF technologies are better for complex geometries with support for hollow, void structures owing to the smaller beam/layer size.

        <p>Such a case would be a huge waste because the cost for recalibrating, redesign and/or moulding is significant as well as time-consuming. It is also applicable in situations where the main large parts can be mass produced by traditional methods while the additional features can be customized and added using DED per requirement.Such a case would be a huge waste because the cost for recalibrating, redesign and/or moulding is significant as well as time-consuming.

        <p>With small beam size and layer thickness, PBF technologies such as SLM and EBM are capable of producing complex parts with high accuracy, as well as good as-built surface quality. PBF can also produce a complete part within a single build operation. This eliminates the necessity for multiple part building operations, as well as the cost for part assembly, thus resulting in significant cost reduction [2]. High accuracy means the parts are produced with good as-built geometry and surface quality, eliminating the need for additional machining as opposed to DED or conventional methods such as casting or forging. However, the production time of PBF is much slower while also having higher manufacturing cost. Additionally, for very highprecision applications such as threads, screws or seals, additional surface machining process is still required.With small beam size and layer thickness, PBF technologies such as SLM and EBM are capable of producing complex parts with high accuracy, as well as good as-built surface quality.

        <p>Additionally, 3D printers usually have the capability to perform specific tasks autonomously with little human supervision. For example, Attaran et al [17] stated that many consumer-level 3D printers have an inbuilt feature called auto levelling. As the printer is able to calibrate itself with this ability, the process of levelling the printing platform requires no human supervision.Additionally, 3D printers usually have the capability to perform specific tasks autonomously with little human supervision.

        <p>Currently, industrial sized 3D printers only have partial autonomous capability. Having a fully autonomous printer would significantly cut down cost and manpower. In conclusion, PBF is better for smaller parts with complex geometries that require high precision and that production time is less of a concern. DED is more suitable for larger parts with simpler geometries with J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f together, which defeats the single piece build advantage in AM processes. In addition, the slow production rate of AM processes is also a major demerit when compared with traditional methods where at the industrial level, large quantities are usually demanded in short time. It is indeed true that conventional methods also require sufficient time for preparation, moulding and tooling. However, once they start, traditional methods are capable of achieving mass production more easily with much higher output rate than the currently available AM processes.Currently, industrial sized 3D printers only have partial autonomous capability.

        <p>Ultimately, due to the above-mentioned disadvantages, AM processes of Ti alloys are still quite limited in normal industries as the traditional methods remain the preferred mechanism thanks to their already developed applications, high production rate and cheaper manufacturing cost at large quantities. The applications of AM-fabricated Ti is also limited to most aerospace and biomedicine applications due to the disadvantages earlier mentioned as these two industries favour customized parts with high -precision demands. With the current development pace and greater availability of AM machines, additive manufacturing of Ti alloys is expected to expand greatly into other fields such as automobiles as well as home appliances.Ultimately, due to the above-mentioned disadvantages, AM processes of Ti alloys are still quite limited in normal industries as the traditional methods remain the preferred mechanism thanks to their already developed applications, high production rate and cheaper manufacturing cost at large quantities.

        <p>Fortunately, the ductility and fatigue life of AM-produced parts can be improved via additional heat treatment and machining such as polishing or turning to be comparable to those conventionally manufactured products. On the other hand, with the current technologies, AMfabricated Ti is still only viable for a small quantity or very high demanding applications such as aerospace, biomedical and some other advanced industries due to high mass production cost, high system cost as well as low production rate. As AM processes of Ti alloys are being made available with cost reduction, more opportunities for a wider range of applications are expected in the near future though admittedly some manufacturing challenges may be encountered as well.Fortunately, the ductility and fatigue life of AM-produced parts can be improved via additional heat treatment and machining such as polishing or turning to be comparable to those conventionally manufactured products.
