        <p>To make perovskite solar cells an industrially relevant technology large area deposition techniques are needed and one of the most promising is slot-die coating. This review article details the progress reported in the literature where slot-die coating has been used for the deposition of both the perovskite layer and other layers in the perovskite solar cell device stack. An overview of the methods used to adapt the coating process, materials and drying conditions in order to create high quality layers and devices is given and an outlook on future research directions in this field is made.</p>
        <p>The remarkable opto-electronic properties of lead halide perovskites coupled with the advancements in thin film photovoltaic device fabrication generated from organic photovoltaic (OPV) and dye sensitised solar cell (DSSC) research has propelled perovskite solar cells (PSC) to astonishing power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and the forefront of next generation photovoltaics research. In under a decade PCEs rose from 3.8% in 2009 to certified 24.2% as of July 2019, outperforming well established technologies like multicrystalline silicon and copper indium gallium selenide solar cells (CIGS) [1,2,3,4,5].</p>
        <p>PSCs show great potential in becoming a disruptive technology in the photovoltaics industry, however, there are many challenges yet to overcome to bring this technology to the market.</p>
        <p>For instance, bridging the 'scaling gap' and transitioning PSCs from a lab scale to an industrial scale is a serious challenge [6].</p>
        <p>Compatibility with flexible substrates and devices and the potential for high throughput roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacture that this offers is one of the key features that makes the case for using PSCs compelling. R2R fabrication not only offers the possibility of manufacturing at far higher speeds than those possible for conventional silicon photovoltaics but also offers the opportunity to deploy modules at unprecedented rates and in novel formats, as demonstrated for structurally similar organic photovoltaics [7,8].</p>
        <p>Efforts are being made to upscale the technology with a variety of techniques having been employed for the fabrication of large area PSCs, utilising both solution based and vacuum deposition methods. The most common are spin coating, blade coating [9], screen printing [10], spray coating [11,12], slotdie coating, gravure printing [13] and vacuum deposition [14].</p>
        <p>It could be argued that, to date, the most successful of these is blade coating where it has been used for the deposition of the perovskite layer in modules with PCEs of over 15% and an aperture area of 30cm 2 [15]. Blade coating of perovskites has only been reported for small scale bench-top sheet-to-sheet (S2S) fabrication and not for R2R processes. Only gravure [13] 37 and slot-die coating [16,17,18,19,20,21] have been reported 38 for use in R2R deposition processes for the perovskite layer 39 of the device stack, with slot-die coating resulting in devices 40 achieving both high PCEs and line speeds on flexible glass [20] 41 and plastic substrates [19].</p>
        <p>Slot-die coating is well suited for the deposition of perovskite 43 inks, as well as other layers in the device stack. As a pre-44 metered coating method, it is highly efficient in terms of mate-</p>
        <p>The perovskite layer is the most important layer in the per-110 ovskite solar cell device stack, to this end it is vital to have 111 defect free films with large grain size, crystal phase purity and 112 good film coverage that can deliver higher photovoltaic perfor-113 mance and stability. The following sections will discuss the The two-step or sequential deposition process for the fabrica-120 tion of organic-inorganic perovskite layers was first introduced 121 by Mitzi et al. [24] and later further developed for deposition of 122 the active layer in PSCs by Burschka et al. [25]. In this process 123 a pre-deposited lead halide film is exposed to a cation and halide 124 source e.g. methylammonium iodide (MAI) or caesium iodide, pact of slow drying on slot-die coated PbI 2 films in an effort to deposit the perovskite layer sequentially [16], the formation of highly non-uniform films upon slow drying was noticed, to mitigate the unwanted flow of the ink a process to mimic the spin coating drying mechanism by externally quenching the films by a gas jet was employed. A second slot-die coating head was connected beside the first head and compressed nitrogen gas was flowed on to the just deposited wet film, to speed drying, the 'gas quenched' PbI 2 films formed were found to be dense and with uniform film coverage. Figure 2 shows the difference in the PbI 2 film morphology with gas quenching to that of films allowed to dry under ambient conditions. The dense lead iodide films formed using this process were found to poorly convert to perovskite when exposed to MAI. To increase the reactivity of the PbI 2 films to MAI and obtain full conversion to perovskite, a solvent vapour soaking technique was employed.</p>
        <p>After drying the gas quenched PbI 2 films were stored in an enclosed chamber, this resulted in a more porous film that allowed complete penetration of MAI and a high degree of conversion to perovskite, as well as achieving good film coverage with few pin hole formations. As the perovskite layer, the ECL and hole transport layers (HTL) were deposited using slot-die coating, resulting in a hero cell performance for the complete slot-die coated device of 11.96% PCE. However, storing the film for long periods to make it more reactive is not an ideal method, especially for a scaled-up manufacturing process where reducing the production time and maximising throughput are critical, the process also limits the transition to continuous roll to roll fabrication.</p>
        <p>In order to develop a more scalable method to produce highly reactive PbI 2 films the same group reported using a method, previously demonstrated for spin coated devices [30,31], involving an unstable perovskite intermediate [18]. A non- to date has reported one-step slot-die coated perovskite in the P-322 I-N geometry due to improved perovskite film coverage on top 323 of an organic layer e.g. PEDOT:PSS. However, the stability of 324 the P-I-N stack is a concern to commercial development [37]. Use of air knife following initial nucleation growth. 2. Convective motions and reduced viscosity boost the crystal growth at the interface with the substrate 3. Crystals approach the cooler region reducing the vertical growth rate in favour of lateral growth across the warm substrate. 4. Reduced thickness is achieved.

The optimized R2R process led to the formation of uniaxially oriented crystalline smooth perovskite films. A hero PCE of 14.12% was reported for R2R and 17.31% for S2S slot-die coated films, Figure 6. While the ACN formulation is suitable for large area deposition, it could be argued that high flammability and still considerable toxicity of this solvent system might hinder its commercial use.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, DMSO is another less toxic solvent for use in large area manufacturing of PSCs. The solvent itself is considered low toxicity but it is able to easily penetrate the skin along with any solute dissolved in it. However, with proper safety precautions it is an attractive option. Unfortunately, the poor wetting of DMSO on most substrates makes it quite difficult to print with good film coverage. Galagan et al. demonstrated the addition of 10%vol/vol 2-Butoxyethanol in DMSO to lower the surface tension of the solvent mixture. This improved wetting and achieved improved film coverage [19]. In (except top contact) processed PSC reported so far, showing an impressive efficiency of 11.7%.</p>
        <p>Recently, 2D perovskites have gained interest due to improved lifetime compared to 3D perovskites [56]. 2D perovskites are typically prepared by introducing a large organic molecule (for example butylammonium) in between the layers of 3D perovskite. Previously the performance of the PSCs with 2D perovskite have been quite low compared to 3D perovskite, however they have significantly improved in the past few years and have recently achieved 14.1% PCE [57]. Excellent lifetime and improvement in the performance of 2D perovskite based PSCs has encouraged their use with large area printing and has not yet been given [67].</p>
        <p>For the N-I-P device stack slot-die coating of spiro-MeOTAD 682 was reported by Burkitt et al. [42] where the use of a highly The use of P3HT as a slot-die coated HTL has also been reported for both S2S and R2R devices, but has generally resulted in lower performance or been used in conjunction with another evaporated HTL [16,18].</p>
        <p>Slot-die coating of HTLs is a relatively understudied area of research and in particular the reports on the deposition of more stable materials and metal oxides is scarce.</p>
        <p>In PSCs transparent conductive oxides (TCO) have been the preferred choice for transparent electrode (hereafter referred as bottom electrode) mainly because of its good electrical con- For top contact, high vacuum thermal evaporation is typically used for lab scale fabrication which basically is a bottle neck for cost effective high through put manufacturing. Printing the solution processed top electrode is not trivial for number of reasons. Ideal top electrode would have high conductivity which can be processed at low temperature and the processing solution must be orthogonal to all the layers underneath. To realize complete solution processed PSCs, solutions like fully printed mesoscopic PSCs [10] and printable top electrodes have been proposed. [69]. However, till date to the best of our knowledge no reports are available showcasing the slot die printing of top electrode in PSCs. Other techniques like ink-jet [70] and spray coating [69] have been implemented to print silver nanowire as top electrode.</p>
        <p>Good performance has been reported so far on slot-die coated PSCs, however, this has been demonstrated mostly for small area devices with small aperture masks used for testing. It is equally important to showcase the performance of large area printed PSCs to assess its potential for manufacture and actual power generation. The first slot-die coated perovskite module was reported by Hwang K et al. with 40cm 2 active area but the performance was poor and not reported fully [16]. Later in finding ways to achieve the best of both in one system seems a highly desirable target. In particular, achieving a rapid drying low viscosity solvent system that is also able to deliver Cs ions but avoids the use of toxic ACN would overcome some of the hurdles to demonstrating a reliable industrially relevant R2R coating process.</p>
        <p>Both of these works have also shown the use of SnO area and worthy of further study, the coating method seems well adapted to this and is likely to be the method of choice for R2R compatible coatings of these materials seen in the future. Slot-die coating has potential for deposition of other layers in the device stack, such as transparent conductive films and electrodes, but the lack of full 2D patterning might limit this to certain device stacks. As well as photovoltaics there are other technologies where slot-die coating of perovskites has been reported, including photodetectors [71] and PeLEDs [72] and developments in these areas are likely to also be relevant to photovoltaics.</p>
