        <p>Our society is facing massive challenges to ensure a sustainable future. For instance, numerous strategies exist or are under investigation to guarantee progress based on more energyefficient technology, able to produce value-added chemicals with low energy and mass requirements, in a circular economy concept that includes dramatic reduction of the generation surfaces. [11,12] For example, Somorjai and co-workers controlled the selectivity of dendrimer-encapsulated Au nanoclusters (Au-G4OH/SBA-15) by varying the dendrimer properties which is in a similar strategy used by ligand modification in a homogeneous catalyst. [13] In another example to tune the selectivity, Ag nanowire was found more selective for ethylene epoxidation reaction compared to spherical catalyst. [14] However, heterogeneous catalysis is essentially a surface process, and therefore it is limited by surface accessibility. The catalyst development therefore involves a decrease in size of the active phase, as the reduction in particle size implies an increase in surface-to-volume ratio. This process has gained enormous advancement by the advent of nanoscience and nanotechnology, more recently has found a revolutionary approach in the development of single-atom catalysts (SACs). [15] In 2003, Saltsburg and Flytzani-Stephanopoulos investigated Au and Pt in an ionic forms which were strongly associated with the surface of ceria and responsible for the water-gas shift reaction. They reported that Pt or Au nanoparticles on the surface of ceria did not participate in the catalysis, the ionic form of Au or Pt on the surface of ceria has functioned as SACs. [16] Subsequently, in 2006, Bashyam and Zelenay investigated cobalt and iron porphyrins complex which was pyrolyzed under controlled temperatures to produce M-N x species which were suggested as an active site for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). [17] However, even before 2003, the role of trace metal existence in organic catalysis cannot be completely ruled out which were the single metallic active sites in homogeneous form. [18,19] In the subsequent years the advancement in characterization tools made it possible to confirm the existence of single-atom (SA). Later in 2011, first the term SACs was introduced by Zhang and co-workers, where they have prepared SACs by using Pt metal on FeO x support that exhibited high catalytic activity and stability for CO oxidation in a H 2 -rich stream. [20] A metal SA can occupy a different location or defect in the host framework. These trap sites can help SA to get stabilize during catalytic cycles and make them leach proof.Our society is facing massive challenges to ensure a sustainable future.

        <p>Figures of merit that allow evaluation of performances and sustainability of heterogeneous catalyst includes selectivity, conditions, activity expressed in terms of turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF), and stability. [21] A promising catalyst must simultaneously be characterized by high conversion with high selectivity, ideally working under mild conditions (low temperature and pressure). Furthermore, it should possess long term thermal and chemical stability. The accessibility of the active sites is highly desired for the overall performance of catalysts and hence porosity should not be compromised during the operation. Catalytic activities are also influenced by the interaction of heterogeneous surfaces primarily with the reactant, product, and intermediates which depends on the catalytic reaction conditions. For a good outcome, the interaction of different components of the catalytic process with the catalyst surface should be self-sufficient to propagate a reaction, which is hard to estimate quantitatively. Surface nonuniformity also makes it more difficult to understand the interaction between the active sites and reactants at the molecular level. And these effects may play an important role in controlling the catalysis in a broad range of reaction conditions. Hence, to achieve a high selectivity, a uniform catalytic surface needs to be designed for the production of targeted reaction products. However, nanocatalyst surfaces are highly challenging to controls but then again SACs may lead to highly selective catalysts.Figures of merit that allow evaluation of performances and sustainability of heterogeneous catalyst includes selectivity, conditions, activity expressed in terms of turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF), and stability.

        <p>SACs can provide an efficient and highly active catalyst for sustainable and greener chemical industries. SACs are the base of biological and natural catalytic processes; and organometallic SA catalysts already have revolutionized industries. [22][23][24] However, these issues associated with the homogenous lead to the development of SACs. [25] SACs not only maximized the utilization of the active sites but also increases efficiency, reduce the metal uses, also change the selectivity. However, many challenges associated with the SACs are needed to address to make the catalytic process more sustainable and benign. [26][27][28] Interest in developing SACs is continuously growing and becoming a new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis. [29,30] The enrolment and development of SACs will have a profound impact on energy (generation and storage), environment protection, and chemical manufacturing from waste resources. [31] There are several methods reported for the preparation of SACs such as impregnation (wet and dry impregnation), [32] coprecipitations, [33] atomic layer deposition (ALD), [34] by carbonization of MOF in the presence of an inert atmosphere, [35] and wet-chemical synthesis. [36] Aggregation of metal atoms during the synthesis is a major challenge for large-scale production, however, atomic level dispersion can be controlled using expensive technologies such as ALD [37] and mass-selected soft landing. [38] Nevertheless, the use of these techniques is still limited to large-scale production. The use of metal nanoparticles as a precursor for preparing SACs under thermal treatment was recently demonstrated. A facile thermal emitting strategy from bulk nanoparticles to SA could be an alternative and appealing solution. [39] Thermal vaporized Pt atom can be stabilized by N 4 atoms on defected graphene. Few methods for the preparation of SACs are summarized in Figure 1.SACs can provide an efficient and highly active catalyst for sustainable and greener chemical industries.

        <p>Stabilization of SA is a major challenge that can be achieved by optimum coordination with the neighboring heteroatoms. In the direction of the synthesis of stable SACs, a strong covalent metal-support interaction can yield high metal loading on the metal oxide surface. The thermally stable Pt-SA are either trapped by already deposited Pt atoms or PtO 2 formed during high-temperature calcination. [46] A simple organic molecule chelating approach can also be used for the atomic dispersion of an SA on host support. For example, ethanolamine can chelate Pt cations and later can be removed by a rapid thermal treatment in an inert atmosphere. [47] Many advanced characterization techniques including high angle annular dark-field scanning tunneling electron microscopy, [48] scanning tunneling microscopy, [49] X-ray absorption microscopy, [50,51] infrared spectroscopy [52] are essential to identify highly active and stable SACs at large scale for industrial applications. [53] Theoretical calculations by density functional theory (DFT), [54] primarily applied to the ideal system which can help in understanding the catalytic phenomena at the atomic or molecular level. Apart from all, most in-built approach for the characterization of an SA is direct imaging at the atomic scale using X-ray absorption near edge structure [55] and extended X-ray absorption fine structure [56] which can provide information relating to the nature of neighboring atomic sites and corresponding oxidation states.Stabilization of SA is a major challenge that can be achieved by optimum coordination with the neighboring heteroatoms.

        <p>The atomic-level information of active sites, their molecular geometry, and reaction mechanisms can be identified using operando characterization which allows in situ monitoring of surface oxidation states and local atomic structure transformation. [57][58][59] In situ measurement can provide real data during the catalytic cycle which promotes the in-depth fundamental understanding of the catalytic system.

        <p>Green and sustainable chemistry is a world-shattering philosophy that builds a sustainable society by improving hazardous chemical processes, reduce chemical waste by developing alternative green processes, and reduce the risk of chemical products posed to humans and the environment. [98,99] For the environmentally benign future, there is a need to redesign alternative chemical processes using advanced catalytic technologies because catalysis is a key in the material transformations at the atomic and molecular level. The development of unique highly functionalized heterogeneous metal catalysts based on the cheaply available abundant metal could be an alternate path. [100,101] Preparation of well-defined nanoparticles with controlled size, shapes, and morphologies are used for various heterogeneous catalytic applications. [102,103] The shape control catalysis to define the selectivity and better activity is well known in the heterogeneous catalytic applications of nanomaterials. [104] The effects of the size of nanoparticles are a much-debated topic in nanocatalysis and are discovered multiple times. It is very important to understand how nanoparticle size played an important role in specific catalytic performance. For example, Shao et al. discussed the effect of a Pt nanoparticle (in the range of 1-5 nm) on the oxygen reduction in HClO 4 solution. [105] It is noted that the ORR activity of Pt nanoparticles depends on the oxygen binding energy, and accessibility of different Pt sites on cubooctahedral particles of various sizes (Figure 2a,b). It is well known that the surface reactivity of any particles is associated with surface accessibility, high reactivity of the reactant might block the active sites due to the strong adsorption of intermediates. And low activity might not allow dissociating OO bond and efficient charge transfer. As shown in Figure 2a, the specific activity of Pt nanoparticles decreased fourfold when the particle size change from 2.2 to 1.3 nm, because surface sites decrease gradually with decreasing particle size while dispersion increase and became maximum for 1 nm nanoparticles (Figure 2a). As the size of the particle decreases, the average oxygen-binding energy of all surface sites is higher than the fcc sites due to contribution from the edge sites (Figure 2b). The presence of edge sites was the main reason for low specific activity which was due to strong oxygen-binding energies on these sites. Both mass activity and specific activity were low for particle size lesser than 2.2 nm. Hence different adsorption sites on the surface of nanoparticles are majorly involved in controlling catalytic activity. However, the shape and size control is now saturated, and there is less possibility for further development. [106] However, the synthesis of shape-controlled nanoparticles with a defined size is highly challenging and tedious. Not only the size and shape, but many other factors including chemical composition, type of support, metalsupport interaction, metal and support interaction with the reactant, product, intermediate, and solvent can also have a significant effect on the overall catalytic outcome. [107,108] Recently, the supported SACs catalytic activities have been improved drastically which is equal or greater than the organometallic catalysts. [109] Lately, technology development and characterization techniques have enabled us to prepare a catalyst on a large scale with precisely controlled SA homogeneously dispersed on the support. [110] At the atomic level, selectivity and reaction conversion can be changed via precisely controlling the atomic cluster or SA. [113] Thus, an SA may show the limited geometric transformation, depending on the type of support. When an SA is stabilized via a functional group, geometry may evolve due to the interaction with the different components of reaction species, and eventually, come into the SA organometallic region. [114] On the other hand, as the cluster size increase from an SA to a group of several atoms (atom less than 20), a different geometric structure may evolve due to the overlap of nearby atomic orbitals. [115,116] Interestingly, the geometric structure of these clusters is quite interesting and could change with the reaction conditions, allowing to change the selectivity and activity. Although it is hard to predict experimentally, theoretical calculations could help in categorizing different atom orbitals. For example, calculations predicted that the geometric configuration of Au 3 cluster can change from linear to triangular when the charge changes from Au -3 to Au +3 . [117] As the particle size increases more than 40 atoms (&gt;1 nm) geometric structures are less sensitive and more stable, exposed atoms at facet, cornet, or edges; and metal-support interactions changed, etc. [118] Geometrical deformation also depends on the adsorption of small gas molecules on the metal species. For example, Lei et al. studied the structural changes in Pt nanoparticles (1-3 nm) using CO and H 2 adsorption. [111] A significant change in the PtPt bond was observed when H 2 and CO were adsorbed on the surface of Pt nanoparticles, which was due to orbital hybridization between the metal and gas molecular orbital (Figure 2c-e). This is also the reason for the formation of Pd 2D nanosheets due to the selective adsorption of CO on the Pd surface (Figure 2f). [112] Possibly, CO could replace dibenzylideneacetone (DBA) ligand in Pd 2 (DBA) 3 and formed an unstable Pd-CO complex which leading to form metallic Pd clusters. These clusters arranged themself into Pd nanosheets on the interface of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The replacement of DBA ligands by CO was later confirmed by the free energy calculations. The slow diffusion of CO in the emulsion followed by slow reduction and ligand replacement by CO, complexation, or adsorption of CTAB were the key factors for the formation of Pd nanosheets. Hence, molecular interactions are very important phenomena to change the catalytic pathways to tune adsorption behaviors of any species.Green and sustainable chemistry is a world-shattering philosophy that builds a sustainable society by improving hazardous chemical processes, reduce chemical waste by developing alternative green processes, and reduce the risk of chemical products posed to humans and the environment.

Hence, molecular interactions are very important phenomena to change the catalytic pathways to tune adsorption behaviors of any species.</p>
        <p>Recently, considerable attention has been paid to the developing a variety of methods for a large-scale synthesis of SACs which is only possible by the advancement in the characterization techniques and advanced sustainable methodology. [119] For example, Yang et al. produced Kg scale (transition metal) TM-SACs including Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ru, and Pt by the ligand-mediated method with high metal loading.

[27] This can be achieved by designing SACs using various support. [128] The development of highly efficient electrocatalyst at low cost is critical for the wide application of sustainable and renewable energy conversion technologies. [73] SACs have attracted significant attention due to their high catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity. Recently, heteroatom-free defected carbon host to anchor Pt-SA for ORR applications have been reported. [129] Pt-SA was stabilized by four carbon atoms in carbon deviancies (Pt-C 4 sites), which were the active sites for ORR. Pt 1 /C as a cathode performed a maximum power density of 520 mW cm -2 at 80 °C in an acidic H 2 /O 2 single cell. Later, an important role of heteroatom doping on catalytic activity, and selectivity have been predicted and proved experimentally. M-N 4 sites, which are responsible for the important behavioral change of SA, are theoretically and experimentally predicted. [66,130,131] In another study Liu et al. reported that pyridinic nitrogen atom anchored single Pt atoms are highly active for the ORR reaction and tolerance to CO and methanol poisoning. [132] Zeng et al. prepared a Pt-SACs grafted on Fe-N 2 centers. [133] The SACs with 2.1 wt% optimum loading exhibited a half-wave potential of 0.80 V compared to Fe-N-C (0.79 V). The enhanced multifunctional electrochemical activity was associated with the Pt-O 2 -Fe-N 4 sites, which protected the Fe sites from the harmful deactivating species. [133] ORR is proceeding with two or four-electron pathways depending on the surface-active sites. [134] Conventional Pt nanoparticles normally followed 4e -pathways; however, an isolated Pt may not be able to break the oxygen bond due to the absence of adjacent active sites, and the reaction may follow two-electron pathways to produce H 2 O 2 . Hence by adjusting the distance of the active site, sustainable H 2 O 2 production can take place using ORR reaction pathways. Yang et al. produced a Pt-SA supported on titanium nitride (TiN) and SA was stabilized on N-vacancy.

        <p>The Pt/TiN catalyst with 0.35% loading exhibited H 2 O 2 production with a high mass activity of 78 A per gram Pt at an overpotential of 0.05 V. However, the H 2 O 2 selectivity (more than 90%) for 0.05 and 0.1 wt% Pt/TiN samples were higher than the 0.035 wt% Pt/TiN catalyst. The support also played an important role in catalytic properties similar to the ligand effect in a homogeneous catalyst. The Pt/TiC performed better in terms of catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability for the H 2 O 2 production than the Pt/TiN. [136] The better catalytic activity of Pt/TiC might be due to the weak interaction with O 2 molecules which could be the surface poisoning in the case of Pt/TiN. The Pt/TiC did not allow two-electrons pathways which is a major requirement for H 2 O 2 production. The chemical nature of support changes the catalytic properties of SA and the dimension of support also significantly affects the outcome of the catalytic reaction. H 2 O 2 is one of the most widely used chemicals which can be produced by selective reduction of O 2 to H 2 O 2 . [137] For selective reduction of O 2 , the distance between Pt atoms were adjusted on hollow CuS x support. [137] The strong interaction between Pt and S (i.e., CuS x ) avoids the formation of PtPt bond which results in individual Pt sites with the ultrahigh loading of 24.8 wt%. Pt/CuS x can reduce O 2 to H 2 O 2 with 92-96% selectivity in a wide range of potential of 0.05-0.7 V in acidic electrolyte. Pt/CuS x catalyst shows the mass activity of 35 ± 4 A mg cat -1 at 0.4 V. Recently, a study theoretically projected the ORR activity of Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, and Au supported on a 2D boron deficient boron nitride (BN) nanosheet. [138] It was observed that d-valence electrons of a metal atom help in the 4e -reaction pathway and only with the optimized binding strength of OH* species exhibited higher ORR activity. The Pd/BN showed a 0.42 eV reaction barrier compared to the Pt/BN catalyst (0.79 eV). The high catalytic activity is attributed to the formation of M-N 3 coordination sites which is in correlation with the previous studies. [139] Although, the predictions of M-N x active sites are highly complex and challenging which is hard to control during synthesis. [125] Most of the reports have been discussed the existence of only one type of active site which may be contradicting. However, the existing framework of characterization techniques may not include differentiating differentiation of the actives sites, and the possibility of invisible active sites may not be overruled. [61,140] Note to worthy, recently, Huang et al. reported a synthesis of Fe-N 5 active sites through mimicking the enzyme active centers; Fe-N 5 active sites resembled the heme of natural redox enzyme, i.e., cytochrome P450. [141] In a similar direction of exploring 2D support, an ultrathin FePt nanosheet was used for anchoring Pt single sites. [142] The SACs were prepared with a high loading of 6.7 wt% Pt with a high electrochemical active surface area of 545.5 m 2 g Pt -1 and seven times higher mass activity compared to the commercially available Pt/C catalyst. From a catalysis point of view, bimetallic or nanocomposite of many metals has always some synergistic effect. This could be the reason for the excellent performance of ORR. In this context, Zhang et al. have prepared Pt/Pd single atom alloy (SAA) supported on nitrogendoped carbon nanotubes using the atomic layer deposition technique.

        <p>Pt-Pt coordination number. Moreover, due to the atomic dispersion of highly active species in more inert and catalytically selective host metal support, SACs have proven to catalyze a series of electrochemical, photo-electrochemical and thermal industrial reactions. [144,145] A Pt-based electrocatalyst has been considered the benchmark for electrocatalytic application, however, high cost and low abundance hindered its commercialization on a large-scale production. Therefore, great efforts have been placed in the development of a low-cost catalyst by using earth-abundant materials to replace Pt-based electrocatalysts. [146] In this regard, several abundantly available and low-cost transition metal (TM)-based electrocatalysts such as Cr, [147] Mn, [148] Fe, [149] Co, [150] Ni, [151] Cu, [152] Zn, [153] and Ru [154] have been developed. Apart from the several SA catalysts, the Fe-SA-based one being more explored than the other TM-based catalysts. Several reports predicted the formation of Fe-N x active sites which were found stable against recyclability, CO, and methanol tolerance. [42] Apart from these studies, Fe-N x actives sites are also found stable against poisoning agents such as SCN -1 . Several methods have been reported for the molecular-level design of Fe-SACs, and, as per rational design, Fe-containing precursors at the molecular level to stabilize the Fe atoms during the high-temperature synthesis. For example, a Fe-electrocatalyst has been prepared via thermal melting of a zeolitic imidazolate metal-organic framework (ZIF-8). [155] For the synthesis of Fe-electrocatalyst, the ZIF-8 was thermally melted with graphene nanosheets and decomposed to generate a thin and active porous carbon layer during the pyrolysis. Such an electrocatalyst possessed a high specific surface area of &gt;1000 m 2 g -1 and high catalyst ORR activity with half-wave potential of 0.903 V in alkaline media and 0.837 V in acidic media compared to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. In the same way, ZIF-8 with ferrocene was employed as a molecular precursor of Fe for the preparation of Fe-SA embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon. Molecules of ferrocene already have a Fe-SA at the center and their immobilization on a porous carbon support help to synthesize efficient SACs with high loading and efficient ORR activity. Such a catalyst exhibited a half-wave potential of 0.904 V compared to Pt/C (0.837 V), which is 67 mV higher than the best commercially available catalyst. [156] It has been theoretically and experimentally proving that the coordination environment has a significant effect on the catalytic properties of metal centers. [157,158] Previous studies demonstrated that M-N x sites are desired for the excellent catalytic activity of SACs. [159,160] In the case of Fe-SACs, Fe-N 4 sites are widely reported as active sites, [161][162][163] however, it could be possible that M-N 2 or M-N 3 may also coexist, which cannot be detected spectroscopically. It has been theoretically proven that Fe-N 2 sites could be more active than Fe-N 4 sites however it is hard to control the types of active sites during the catalyst preparation. [164] DFT calculation predicted that Fe-N 2 sites were better than Fe-N 4 , due to lower interaction with *O 2 and OH intermediate and enhance the electron transport. Zhu et al. prepared a bimodal template-based synthesis of Fe-N 2 active sites containing SACs. [43] In addition to a decent ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.927 V in an alkaline medium, the catalyst possessed high antipoisoning power and a high affinity for O 2 . DFT calculation also predicted that the Fe-N 2 sites are more active than the Co-N 2 sites for ORR reaction which could be due to the lower energy barrier of the intermediates and products involved. Further, Fe-N 2 facilitates the rate-limiting release of OH* and antipoisoning abilities toward SCN -. Likewise, other researchers also developed a Fe-SA ORR catalyst using graphene for high-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. [165] Many other carbon variants were also used for the preparation of SACs, for example, N-doped carbon nanotubelined to hollow carbon nanosphere [44] and hierarchical porous carbon [166] have been used for Fe-SA ORR catalyst preparation.Pt-Pt coordination number.

        <p>As we have noted, different coordination environments (M-N 4 , MN 3 , or M-N 2 ) have a significant effect on the catalytic properties of SA. Besides this, in combination with N, and other heteroatoms such as S or P can also improve the catalytic activity. [167] Zhang et al. prepared Fe-SACs using an N and S doped porous carbon host (Figure 4a-d). [168] FeN 4 S 2 have also shown high tolerance to methanol and high recyclability up to 5000 cycles. The DFT modeling predicted that the FeN 4 S 2 sites were more active than the CoN 2 S 1 and NiN 2 S 1 sites (Figure 4), which was due to the higher charge density, the lower energy barrier of intermediate, and the product formed during catalytic cycles. The charge density of metal atom is highly important for ORR activity, and DFT calculation predicted that FeN 4 S 2 is 0.11 which is higher than the CoN 3 S 1 (0.09) and NiN 3 S 2 (0.03), respectively. Figure 4e displayed that the Fe-SA/NSC has the highest density states near to the fermi level compared to Ni and Co-SA/NSC. This Fe-SA/NSC has better electrotransfer properties which are essential for higher conductivity and catalytic performance. The project density of the state (PDOS) of all three metal centers was calculated and particularly, the Fe d-orbitals exhibit higher occupied states near the Fermi level (Figure 4f). For further atomic level information about the good ORR activity, Gibbs free energy (Figure 4g,h) calculation predicted that most endothermic step for CO and Ni-SA/NSC is the last step to form 4OH -with a limiting barrier of 1.15 and 2.79 eV, respectively (Figure 4h). However, the rate-determining step for Fe-SA/NSC demonstrates the different pathways at the formation stage of OH*, and the limiting barrier decrease to as low as -0.65 eV. In particular, the coordinated S atoms played an important role in lowering the reaction barrier which is essential for a good ORR activity. The optimized ORR catalytic activity of Fe-SA/NSC is due to the lower energy barrier of intermediates and methanol tolerance, and also unveiled stability with negligible changes within 5000 cycles.As we have noted, different coordination environments (M-N 4 , MN 3 , or M-N 2 ) have a significant effect on the catalytic properties of SA.

        <p>Not only neighboring heteroatoms are important for tunning the catalytic activity of SA, a neighboring different metal SA may also change essential properties. For example, Sun and co-workers have revealed the active sites and catalytic mechanism of N-coordinated Fe and Ni dual SA-doped carbon for ORR applications. [169] From DFT calculations it was predicted that FeNi-N 6 with type-I (each metal atom coordinated with four nitrogen atoms) have better ORR activity compared to type-II, i.e., FeNi-N 6 (where each metal atom coordinated with three nitrogen atom. DFT also revealed that different active sites having different ORR activity and activity trends were FeNi-N 6 (type-I) &gt; FeNi-N 6 (type-II) &gt; Fe-N 4 &gt; Fe 2 -N 6 . As we know that to break the OO, two adjacent sites are required, and the multimetal-atom structure motif permits the formation of OO bridge model which favors 4e -reaction in an acidic medium.Not only neighboring heteroatoms are important for tunning the catalytic activity of SA, a neighboring different metal SA may also change essential properties.

DFT also revealed that different active sites having different ORR activity and activity trends were FeNi-N 6 (type-I) &gt; FeNi-N 6 (type-II) &gt; Fe-N 4 &gt; Fe 2 -N 6 . As we know that to break the OO, two adjacent sites are required, and the multimetal-atom structure motif permits the formation of OO bridge model which favors 4e -reaction in an acidic medium.</p>

[170] FeN x SACs exhibited the most promising electrochemical catalytic activity, however, it had a serious stability issue due to oxidative corrosion through the Fenton reaction.

        <p>catalysts, very few reports on Cu-SACs were reported. [178][179][180] Cu-based SACs prepared via a single pyrolysis method of Cu phthalocyanine as a precursor for the ORR application. [152] The catalyst showed a half-wave potential of 0.81 V in the alkaline medium which was 30 mV lower compared to the Pt/C catalyst. The catalyst Cu-SA/N-C also showed stability up to 5000 redox cycles with only 9 mV negative shift in half-wave potential. Also, the reason for good ORR activity was predicted using DFT modeling and calculation suggested that the process from OOH* to O* is a rate determining step. A simple and scalable approach for the synthesis of SACs was demonstrated via direct transformation of bulk atom to SA and subsequent coordinate with the N-rich carbon. [179] Majority of the SACs were reported the existence of M-N x active sites in different proportions. In a similar fashion, ZnN x /C was prepared and atomic dispersion of Zn exhibited catalytic activity similar to that of the other metal.

        <p>Energy conversion technologies based on renewable energy sources such as water, wind, solar, and tidal are a promising way for a sustainable and green pollution-free future. The core of these technologies is electrochemical redox reactions and the implementation of a cheap and largely available metal as a catalyst may push back the frontiers. The OER reaction is a bottleneck of the overall reaction for water splitting and halfreaction can be described as (2H 2 O = O 2 + 4H + + e -). [184] The reaction consists of four consecutive intermediate steps, which are controlled by many intermediates and active surface sites; [185] several reaction mechanisms using metal centers as an active site have been proposed. [186,187] The OER is a kinetically sluggish anodic reaction and requires a large overpotential to deliver considerable current. Typically, RuO 2 and IrO 2 are candidates for the state-of-the-art electrocatalyst for OER, although they are expensive and serious dissolution during long-term use are their main limitations.

The DFT calculations indicate that the first activation step involved adsorption of a single oxygen atom on a Ru site to form O-Ru 1 -N 4 which reacted with water through the nucleophilic attack followed by deprotonation to generate OOH*. The O-Ru 1 -N 4 increases the valence state of Ru with more oxidation states which are the active sites for OER. Hence, the O-Ru 1 -N 4 has a lower barrier of O-O coupling to form OOH* intermediate.M-N 4 sites are majorly proposed as electrocatalytic active sites for the ORR, these single atomic sites could be highly active for the OER.

        <p>A scalable nanocasting approach was recently reported for Pt-SA decorated porous NiO and SiO 2 was utilized as a hard template. [199] Bulk Pt-doped NiO nanocubes were prepared by impregnation, drying, calcination in air, and SiO 2 was removed using NaOH. A large scale, around 200 g of 0.5 wt% Pt/NiO nanocubes was prepared in a single batch using a nanocoating approach, as well, other variants using ALD and impregnation were also prepared for compression using an impregnation method. The OER activity order was 0.5 wt% Pt/NiO &gt; ALD-Pt/ NiO &gt; 1 wt% Pt/NiO &gt; NiO. The first-principles calculation indicated the charge transfer from Pt to Ni through O leads to a local weaker NiO bond. [199] The Pt helped in an effective phase transformation from NiO to γ-NiOOH rate by reducing the migration barrier of the nearby Ni atom. The phase transition of NiO to γ-NiOOH in alkaline medium was an origin of OER activity and the thickness of γ-NiOOH phase was estimated, i.e., 0.5 wt% Pt/NiO &gt; ALD-Pt/NiO &gt; NiO which was in agreement with the OER activity. [199] Boosting the OER of single atomic sites using electronic coupling with layered double hydroxide (LDH) could be another way. [200] Ru-SA decorated Co/Fe double hydroxide comprises a strong electronic coupling between Ru and a layered double hydroxide. A Ru/FeCo-LDH exhibited high electrocatalytic activity with an overpotential of 198 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm -2 and a small Tafel slope of 39 mV dec -1 . Spectroscopy measurements revealed that Ru remains in the (IV) oxidation state even at high overpotential due to the synergistic electron coupling with Fe and Co. [200] The firstprinciples DFT simulations and Hubbard U (DFT + U) calculations have been used to stimulate the OER process based on the 4e -mechanism. The Ru/FeCo-LDH was considered as loading ruthenium hydroxide complex on 001 crystal plane of LDH by releasing one water molecule and Ru atom coordinated with five oxygen atoms which increased the oxidation states. The optimized structure of intermediates is presented in Figure 5a,b. For CoFe-LDH and Ru/FeCo-LDH, the formation of *OOH group from *O was found to be the rate-determining step (Figure 5c,d). For the rate-determining step, Ru-SA on the surface of CoFe-LDH showed the lowest Gibbs free energy (1.52 eV) than the Fe-SA on the edge of FeCo-LDH (1.94 eV). The strong electronic coupling interaction between Ru and CoFe-LDH surface tuned the electronic and coordination state or Ru-SA which allowed Ru atom to exist in a lower +4 oxidation state. Engineering single atomic sites on the surface of LDH provide better stability and catalytic activity, for example, Chen et al. [201] developed Ir-NiFe-LDH; and Feng and co-workers [202] synthesized Ru-NiFe-LDH. Zhang et al. used Au-SA decorated NiFe-LDH for OER applications, 0.4 wt% Au loaded NiFe-LDH exhibited sixfold OER activity enhancement. [203] Electrochemical deposition is a universal route for the fabrication of SA electrocatalysts. [204] Lai et al. used a general p-electron assisted strategy for Ir, Pt, Ru, Pd, Fe, and Ni SA electrocatalyst preparation. [205] Metal atoms can be simultaneously anchored on two different domains-NC 3 and centers of Co octahedra of hybrid support. Two distinct SA metal sites worked as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for both OER and HER. The Ir-based bifunctional electrocatalyst outperformed all the other metallic sites and DFT calculations showed that Ir@Co sites can accelerate OER and Ir@NC 3 sites are responsible for HER.A scalable nanocasting approach was recently reported for Pt-SA decorated porous NiO and SiO 2 was utilized as a hard template.

        <p>H 2 is referred to as a fuel of a sustainable future and as an advanced way to decarbonize our environment. Recently, a few countries including Germany have initiated a passenger train based on H 2 as a fuel, Nevertheless, sustainable production of H 2 is remaining a challenge. [219] The H 2 production via HER has been researched as an alternative clean fuel for various uses. [220] In this regard, the H 2 O electrolysis in alkaline media is of primary importance because it is the only largely employed technology worldwide and may become a game-changer to achieve a sustainable future. [221] Recently, Ni 5 P 4 -Ru active sites were found highly active and long term stability for alkaline H 2 production with the low onset potential of 17 mV and an overpotential of 54 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm -2 with a Tafel slop of 53 mV decade -1 . [222] The development of efficient electrocatalysts is crucial, and a large number of active electrocatalysts for HER in an acidic medium have been reported. However, an acidic medium cause corrosion of cells and contaminates the H 2 gas due to the formation of by-products. [223] Advancement in HER can be further accomplished via developing a heterogeneous or SAC electrocatalyst; and noble metal-based catalysts already proved the dominance in this field. [224][225][226][227][228][229][230][231] Recently, noble metals (Pt, Pd, and Ir) based electrocatalysts have been the most active materials for HER, although high cost, easy agglomeration, and poor stability in an acidic medium impede their further development. [232] A Pt-SA coordinated with graphdiyne (GDY) has been developed for HER reactions. [233] The GDY formed two types of complexes with a Pt atom, C 1 -Pt-Cl 4 (Pt-GDY1) created five-coordinated species, and C 2 -Pt-Cl 2 (Pt-GDY2) form 4-coordinated species. The Pt-GDY1 displayed high catalytic activity for HER with a mass activity of 23.64 A mg -1 which was 3.3 and 26.9 times higher than Pt-GDY2 (7.26 A mg -1 ) and Pt/C (0.88 A mg -1 ). This was due to the higher total unoccupied density of state of the Pt 5d orbital and close to the zero value of Gibbs free energy of hydrogen production. Similarly, an SA can also be stabilized using carbon vacancies. A series of TM such as Cu, Ag, Au, Ni, Pd, and Pt were immobilized on TiC. [234] Carbon vacancies in TiC helped to stabilize SA and the overpotential for HER versus SHE were 230, 220, and 156 mV at 10 mA cm -2 for Au/TiC, Pd/TiC, and Pt/TiC, respectively. Pt/TiC showed 6.5 and 3.5 times higher electrocatalytic activity compared to Pt/C and Pt (NP)/TiC, respectively, which was in consistent with the theoretical calculations. In a similar line, a carbon defect derived Pt atomic cluster (with a precise number of atoms) catalyst was reported for efficient HER. [235] Jiang et al. investigated HER activity of Pt-SA embedded in nonporous cobalt selenide (CoSe). [236] The catalyst exhibited a Tafel slope of 35 mV dec -1 and a high turnover frequency of 3.93 s -1 at -100 mV in a neutral medium versus RHE, which easily outperformed the commercial Pt/C catalyst.H 2 is referred to as a fuel of a sustainable future and as an advanced way to decarbonize our environment.

[234] Carbon vacancies in TiC helped to stabilize SA and the overpotential for HER versus SHE were 230, 220, and 156 mV at 10 mA cm -2 for Au/TiC, Pd/TiC, and Pt/TiC, respectively. Pt/TiC showed 6.5 and 3.5 times higher electrocatalytic activity compared to Pt/C and Pt (NP)/TiC, respectively, which was in consistent with the theoretical calculations. In a similar line, a carbon defect derived Pt atomic cluster (with a precise number of atoms) catalyst was reported for efficient HER. [235] Jiang et al. investigated HER activity of Pt-SA embedded in nonporous cobalt selenide (CoSe). [236] The catalyst exhibited a Tafel slope of 35 mV dec -1 and a high turnover frequency of 3.93 s -1 at -100 mV in a neutral medium versus RHE, which easily outperformed the commercial Pt/C catalyst.</p>
        <p>2D materials including graphene can be good for the electrocatalytic application of SACs. [75,237,238] Sun et al. used N-doped graphene for the preparation of Pt-ACCs (atomic cluster catalysts). [239] The Pt-NG/C exhibited a higher catalytic activity than the single atomic counterpart after 4000 cycles and more than 16 h HER reaction in an acidic medium. Apart from N-doped graphene, N-doped porous carbon is also a good support for the preparation of SACs. A titanium carbide (Ti 3 C 2 T x ) MXene which is a newly discovered 2D material was also employed for the preparation of Ru-SACs. [240] For coordination, S and N heteroatoms were utilized and Ru-N/S-Ti 3 C 2 T x electrocatalyst exhibited a current density of 10 mA cm -2 at a low potential of 76 mV. Apart from this, Ru-N/S-Ti 3 C 2 T x also exhibited superior photoelectrochemical activity with a high photocurrent density of 37.6 mA cm -2 which was higher than the Pt and other noble metal-based catalysis coupled with a Si photocathode. Many Ru and Ir-SA-based electrocatalysts were reported for HER outperformed Pt/C catalyst. [241][242][243][244] Du and co-workers prepared a silver (Ag) SA electrocatalyst for HER using laser ablation in liquid to generate high density stacking faults in Ag nanoparticles. [245] The stacking faults can cause a low coordination number and high tensile strain which improved the adsorption energy and also transformed nonactive Ag in highly active catalytic sites. Ag-SACs achieved a current density of 485 mA cm -2 at -0.3 V, which was 1.7 times higher than Pt/C (282 mA cm -2 ) and was highly durable for 5000 cycles. All the reported SACs have predicted that SA is the only active site; however, a defect may also contribute to catalytic activity which is hard to differentiate and challenging to measure. [246] Cui et al. introduced Co SA bound to distorted MOS 2 with an ensemble effect for HER. [247] Active-site blocking experiments and DFT calculation revealed that the superior electrocatalytic behaviors are due to the synergistic effect of Co and S of MoS 2 .2D materials including graphene can be good for the electrocatalytic application of SACs.

        <p>HER electrocatalytic properties can be further improved by the synergistic effect of two different metallic atoms. In this regard, a combination of Pt-Ru bimetallic dimers were employed to further boost the HER activity, and ALD was utilized to adorn the bimetallic Pt-Ru on the N-doped carbon nanotube (N-CNT) (Figure 6a). [248] Cyclic voltammeter of Pt-Ru/NCNT, Pt-SA, and Pt/C were recorded in 0.5 m H 2 SO 4 at a scanning rate of 50 mV s -1 . Figure 6b shows the HER curves of the different catalysts and the result indicated that the Pt-Ru/ NCNT was a much better catalyst compared to Pt/C and Pt-SA. The Pt-Ru/NCNT showed a mass activity of 23.1 A mg -1 at the overpotential of 0.05 V which was 54 times greater than that of the Pt/C catalyst (Figure 6c). After accelerated degradation tests (ADTs) Pt-Ru/NCNT catalyst exhibited similar activity like before (Figure 6d) and HER showed of 5% loss of activity at the overpotential of 0.05 V, while the Pt-SA demonstrated 9% loss (Figure 6e). On the other hand, the Pt/C exhibited a 28% decrease in the HER activity which was a lot compared to the other two versions (Figure 6e). The TEM analysis was also performed after the ADTs and indicated the existence of a similar dimer Pt-Ru structure. Overall, the Pt-Ru/NCNT shows much higher electrocatalytic activity which is 50 times compared to Pt/C. The DFT energy calculations displayed adsorption energies of Pt-Ru/NCNT and Ru-Ru were -1.3 and -4.87 eV respectively, which indicated that Ru prefers to make Pt-Ru instead of Ru-Ru dimer. The total hydrogen adsorption on active sites was calculated which was gradually increased from 2 to 6, by repeating the sequential adsorption of H atoms; each can hold three atoms (Figure 6f).HER electrocatalytic properties can be further improved by the synergistic effect of two different metallic atoms.

        <p>noble metals, and TM were made significant progress, and further development of SACs enhanced the electrocatalytic performance. [266][267][268] In recent years, increasing interest in higher energy density, cheaper, and safer battery technology has stimulated tremendous research efforts toward the development of improved rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZAB). [257] ZAB is one of the promising sustainable and green candidates using abundant and inexpensive resources with a decent energy density, and high reduction potential. [269] Number of decent efforts has been invested in for increasing the active sites, accessibility, and selectivity for electrocatalytic materials are effective for improving air electrode performance. [270] The SACs have been reported to exhibit a decent electrocatalytic activity for ORR, OER, and HER, which can be used as a potential air-electrode in ZAB. [97,271,272] For example, Co-SA with CoN 4 active sites supported on N-doped graphitic nanosheet exhibited excellent catalytic activity for ORR, OER, and Zn-air battery. [273] In another example, Co-SA doped porous N-doped carbon exhibited good performance in solid-state Zn-Air battery and showed cycling stability of 125 cycles with an open circuit potential of 1.411 V. [274] Metal SA doped M-N x sites are majorly reported and also attract wide attention due to remarkable tuneability, selectivity, high efficiency, and diversity. [71] The coordination between the metal atom and N atoms significantly tunes its electronic environment, which helps to reduce the adsorption energy for intermediates. [275] Although the N coordination has a significant effect on the electronic environment of SA, the electrocatalytic performance may be further tuned with the help of another heteroatom doping such as S, P, B, F, etc. in combination with N doping. [276] In this direction, Xie et al. developed an N and S coordinated Fe-SA electrocatalyst for ZAB by pyrolysis of CNT, 2,2-bipyridine, and Fe precursor under N 2 atmosphere. S, N-Fe/CNT electrocatalyst showed excellent cyclic stability with no change in voltage after 100 cycles. [277] Hence, designing the optimized coordinated catalytic active sites is a promising and sustainable path for designing and preparing a highly efficient catalyst. Han et al. demonstrated a Fe-Nx-C electrocatalyst synthesized by incorporating in situ Fe-Phen complexes into nanocages during the ZIF-8 growth, followed by pyrolysis at 900 °C in an inert atmosphere.

        <p>Rechargeability and cyclic durability of a catalyst are of great significance (Figure 8c), Fe-A/NPS-HC initially showed a charge potential of 2.07 V and a discharge potential of 1.11 V. [279] Lower charge and discharge voltage difference exhibited better rechargeability of Fe-A/NPS-HC. The ZAB indicated a negligible change in voltage after 500 charge-discharge cycle tests with 200 000 s, specifying the outstanding long-term durability of SACs (Figure 8c). Figure 8d shows the polarization and power density curves of proton exchange membrane fuel cells in an acidic medium (PEMFCs) at the testing temperature of 60 °C. Fe-A/NPS-HC in the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) exhibits a noteworthy current density of 50 mA cm -2 at 0.8 V, which is comparable to the highest current density of 75 mA cm -2 reported so far. The maximum power density of Fe-A/NPS-HC-based MEA was 333 mW cm -2 at 0.41 V which was 92% of the power density of Pt/C-based MEA under similar conditions. Yang et al. also produced a Fe-SA catalyst for ZAB, after 200 000 s, 93.6% of the current density at 0.8 V was retained which demonstrated the good durability of ZAB. [280] Many different strategies have been reported for the synthesis of SACs and numerous porous materials as a precursor were employed for the synthesis. Peng et al. used a covalent organic framework (COF) for the preparation of the Fe-SA catalyst and showed ZAB durability for more than 300 h. [281] Similarly, FeCl 3 encapsulated Porphyra precursor pyrolysis strategy was used and porous S-doped Fe-N-C nanosheets were synthesized. [282] The Fe-NSDC electrocatalyst assembled rechargeable ZAB exhibited a higher power density of 225.1 mA cm -2 . Fe-NSDC based ZAB also exhibited lower charge-discharge overpotential and high current density (1 V, 100 mA cm -2 ) compared to Pt/C + RuO 2 catalyst (1.09 V) and Fe-NDC (1.61 V). This could be due to the S-doping optimized charge and spin distribution on Fe-SA to develop good electrocatalytic properties which were ascribed to Fe-N x and Fe-N 3 /S. Apart from the N, S, F doping, PO bond can also change the intrinsic properties of the metal SA. It was proved theoretically and experimentally that the PO bond can effectively update the Fe center electrocatalytic properties and also help in the dispersion of the Fe-N 4 sites. [283] The P-O group produced a favorable surface electronic environment and thus, enriched the catalytic activity. The P-O/FeN 4 -CNS catalyst exhibited a power density of 232 mW cm -2 and a robust cycling performance of 450 cycles under 25 mA cm -2 .

[284] The Fe-N 4 sites revealed good stability at a current density between 10 and 100 mA cm -2 for 23 h and lower power density (232 mW cm -2 ) than the Pt/C + Ir/C based battery (50 mW cm -2 ). To prove the novelty of the PPE strategy, a series of TM such as Fe, Co, Ni, and Mn were anchored on a N-doped porous carbon. Bimetallic SA anchored on N-doped hierarchical meso/microporous FeCo-N x -carbon nanosheets were used for ZAB. [285] For the synthesis, silica was used as a template and exhibited a maximum power density of 150 mW cm -2 , which was found three times higher than the Pt/C. Rechargeability is a good parameter to look for the stable ZAB battery, and the catalyst was found stable for more than 20 h under 20 mA cm -2 with the charging-discharging voltage gap of 0.91 V. The good performance of bimetallic SA electrocatalyst is due to i) the nanometer thickness of carbon sheet can efficiently enhance transport of both electron and oxygen, ii) the combination of Fe and Co with N-doping can modulate electronic properties and surface polarities, iii) the high specific surface area and balanced microporous and mesoporous structure make active sites fully accessible to relevant species and improve the transport properties.The Fe-N 4 catalytic sites were developed via the polymerization-pyrolysis-evaporation (PPE) strategy and the obtained Fe-N 4 sites exhibited superior trifunctional electrocatalytic performance for OER, OER, and HER.

        <p>The performance and cost of the electrocatalyst play an important role in its development and applications in energy conversion and environmental remediations. The development of synthetic strategies and fundamental understanding at the atomic scale is playing an important role in its advancement. Notably, the electrochemical process produced several electrons and intermediates can be extracted during the process and can be utilized for additional organic transformations. [293][294][295] The process of carrying out the organic transformation using electrochemistry is known as organic electrochemistry, [296] and by using this energy-efficient technique, a wide variety of important energy extensive organic transformations can be performed. [297] Electrochemical organic transformations (EOTs) can be utilized to minimize waste production, i.e., are more environmentally friendly, reduce the number of steps, allow milder reaction conditions, and provide an alternative path to accessing the desired product. [298] The EOT can perform direct, indirect, or paired electrolysis with other electrochemical processes such as OER, ORR, or HER. [299,300] These strategies for CH and CN bond formation using the anodic electrochemical method have been summarized. [301][302][303] The use of a redox mediator to achieve indirect processes has been significantly increased. Francke et al. reviewed the basic principles and fundamentals of redox catalysis in organic electrosynthesis. [304] Although, extensive works on the use of an electrochemical system for organic transformations are reported, none of them discussed the use of SACs, therefore several metal-free carbonbased organic electrosynthesis have been published. [305][306][307] The conventional ways of utilizing SACs for organic transformations have been used and summarized. [308] The use of SACs with electrochemical setup may further revolutionize the yield and better selectivity. Yuan et al. coupled HER with electrochemical oxidative cross-coupling of thiols and thiophenols with arenes, heteroarenes, and alkenes catalyzed by TM. [309] An alternative protocol was developed for halogenation under water-free conditions using methanol, an acetonitrile solvent mixture, and a variety of halogenated reagents such as CBr 4 , CHBr 3 , CCl 3 Br, and CCl 4 . A wide range of efficient and benign methods have been developed for the direct formation of CS, CN, CBr, CCl, CO, CP, SS, and CC bonds. The undivided organic electrochemical cell was able to achieve &gt;90% yield and Pt electrode helped to transfer the proton from H 2 to the organic molecules. Despite the good achievement in oxidative coupling of organic molecules with the excellent yield for the CH(sp 3 ) and the C(sp 2 )H functionalization, C(sp)H is highly challenging. In another example, the HER was coupled with an electrochemical oxidative coupling of oxysulfenylation and aminosulfenylation of an alkene. [310] Recently, Jiao et al. [311] and Ackermann et al.

[324] With increasing concern about the environment and contaminating life supportive materials including food, water, and air, there is an urgent need to develop an efficient green and sustainable catalytic process.

[326,327] With the rapid development of SACs for various applications in electrocatalysis, the use of SACs for organic transformations are still under development and no explored highly. [328] For example, Pt 1 /FeO x SACs were three times more active than Pt nanoparticles for CO oxidation. [20] The high catalytic activity is due to the presence of active sites at the atomic level and with time, SACs become the leader of heterogeneous catalysis for organic transformation. For example, Pt-Cu SA nanoalloys were used for the hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene [49] and a Co-N-C SA atom catalyst was employed for the hydrogenative coupling of nitroarenes. [329] CoN 4 C 8 -1-2O 2 active sites coordinated with the four pyridinic N atoms in the graphitic layer were identified as the active sites, and exhibited excellent chemoselective hydrogenation (around 90% conversion in 2 to 7 h, depending on reactant used) of nitroarenes to produce azo compound under mild reaction conditions at 80 °C and 3 MPa H 2 pressure.

        <p>Cui et al. developed a Pt SA heterogeneous catalyst for hydrosilylation reactions of industrial relevant olefins with the TON of 10 5 . [330] To study the Pt-SA catalyst, hydrosilylation reaction of 1-octene and diethoxymethylsilane under solventfree conditions was used as a model reaction. Model reaction occurred with high anti-Markonikov selectivity and low alkene isomerization compared to previously published data using a homogeneous Pt catalyst. Other control reactions using Pt nanoparticles on an Al 2 O 3 nanorod and a commercial Pt/ Al 2 O 3 catalyst showed low activity. The hydrosilylation reaction allowed control over the hydrophobicity of various surfaces, but the selective formation of the SiC bond in the presence of different functional groups is challenging and highly desirable for various applications including elastic skin. A Pt-SA catalyst was used for the hydrosilylation of 4-vinyl-1-cyclohexene (2 V) (Figure 9a). The Pt-SA exhibited good activity for the unsaturated ester with a yield of 89% and the reaction of 4-allylbenzonitrile with 1a results in the corresponding nitrile with 57% yield (Figure 9a).

        <p>The stability and recyclability of selected catalysts showed the recyclability for 6 cycles without any postsynthesis treatment (Figure 9c). To further check the oxygen reactivity of the Pt-SA sites, a more sensitive oxygen-containing allylic compound such as cyclohexyl vinyl ether, 1,2-epoxy-4-vinyl cyclohexane, and allyl glycidyl ether were also hydroxylated. The catalyst showed tolerance to these sensitive oxygen-containing organic with the desirable yield (around 90%). More interestingly the catalyst even tolerated the epoxy ring in allyl glycidyl ethers which are more susceptible to the ring-opening side reactions. Pt-SA catalyst was also used for the industrially relevant reactions of polysilanes with the olefines.

To stimulate and understanding the landscape of the active sites at the atomic level, KSCN poisoning was conducted because SCN -can easily make a strong chelated complex with Fe unsaturated sites. Experimental results suggested that the catalyst may have three types of active sites that were observed in Mössbauer spectroscopy. Out of the three different active sites, the N-(Fe III -N 4 ) medium spin was the most active catalytic sites and one order higher active than high spin sixfold D2 (N-Fe III -N 4 -Y high spin species) and three times more active than the D1 species (Fe II -N 4 medium spin species).

        <p>In another example of selective organic transformations, Rh 1 /MoS 2 SA catalyst was developed for hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol with 100% selectivity. [333] The catalyst studies suggested that the Rh 1 /MoS 2 might have unique geometry and electronic configuration which confined the reactant molecules through the steric effect. The DFT calculations suggested that the MoS 2 sheets oxidized Mo edges and the Rh 1 -SA was stabilized by a Mo cation vacancy which helped in the H 2 adsorption, dissociation into H atoms, and transfers to the double bond for selective hydrogenation. Recently, Zhang et al. used Cu-SA for hydrogenation of quinoline to tetrahydroquinoline with good selectivity (99%) under mild reaction conditions.

        <p>The theoretical perspectives are very important for obtaining a fundamental mechanistic understanding of the catalytic process. Theoretical modeling of the catalytic process and optimization of SA using different TM and operational conditions for a particular reaction can help to decrease the overall process time and also save resources. Hence now a days, theoretical calculations before the experimental process can help to design a specific SA catalyst and will further enhance the time utility. [344,345] Therefore, for theoretical modeling, consideration of real operational conditions is necessary, even though some of the operating conditions may not be possible to include in modeling, due to their complex nature. [197] Kong et al. theoretically confirmed that vanadium atoms were anchored on graphitic carbon nitride for nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation. [346] The high activity of V 1 /g-C 3 N 4 was attributed to low coordination 3d orbital of V atoms, while propylene selectivity was initiated from inhibition of di-σ binding mode of propylene on single V atoms.The theoretical perspectives are very important for obtaining a fundamental mechanistic understanding of the catalytic process. Theoretical modeling of the catalytic process and optimization of SA using different TM and operational conditions for a particular reaction can help to decrease the overall process time and also save resources. Hence now a days, theoretical calculations before the experimental process can help to design a specific SA catalyst and will further enhance the time utility.

        <p>We summarized key examples of SACs for ORR, OER, HER, metal-air batteries, and electrochemical organic transformations. The development of electrocatalysts using noble and non-noble metals and their applications over the last few years were discussed. For the development of SACs, significant progress has been made in terms of large-scale synthesis, understanding the electrocatalytic phenomena and mechanism at the fundamental level, the role of the metal support, and bimetallic system on the activity and selectivity. The selectivity and catalytic properties that are mainly driven by the electronic environment of the SA can be tuned via a combination of support, heteroatoms doping and using the multimetallic system. Theoretical work is also conducted to understanding of electrocatalytic mechanism at the molecular level, major progress has been made in this regard. The development of an efficient protocol to produce low metal loading catalysts at the atomic level on a large scale is highly desirable. The catalyst prepared from the industrial metal waste sources should be an obvious choice to make a circular economy. Integration of an electrochemical device with electricity from renewable sources is another key step to making a greener future; however, while calculating the carbon footprint, it is necessary to include the cost of renewable energy generation.We summarized key examples of SACs for ORR, OER, HER, metal-air batteries, and electrochemical organic transformations.

        <p>Concerns about the environment have been continuously increasing, which is due to an increase in energy demand and globalization. To meet the energy demand and achieve environmental remediation, we need to develop an efficient and sustainable protocol to generate a large amount of energy without further degrading and contaminating the environment. SACs are the most efficient catalyst produced so far. Nevertheless, we are still facing some challenges about SACs long-term reusability and stability. In this section, we take an opportunity to highlight the possible future applications of SACs which have not been explored yet or either not discussed in detail. For further focus, we need to concentrate on some important fields which need to be addressed urgently.Concerns about the environment have been continuously increasing, which is due to an increase in energy demand and globalization.

        <p>1. Rational design of SACs: Engineering the rational design for large-scale production of SACs is highly desirable for its key advancement in various fields. [347] Several theoretical [128,[348][349][350] and experimental models [351][352][353] are given for SACs rational designs. Besides these predictable models, understanding the catalytic activity and its composition relation is highly complex and challenging. It is simply unbearable to test all the relevant catalyst combinations for the desired reaction when catalyst involved a combination of several types of active sites (different active sites structures) and compositions (support and bimetallic to multimetallic), and size (SA to cluster of several single atoms). [145,354,355] These factors are strongly dependents on one another and catalytic activity could be the combination of all influencers. However, a systematic approach could lead to overcome all the barriers and allow to design of rational catalysts. 2. Densely packed SACs: The synthesis of SACs with high metal loading is highly demanding for various industrial applications. However, the fabrication of such material is highly challenging, due to the limitation of various synthesis procedures. For example, conventional pyrolysis protocol usually leads to the agglomeration of SA to bigger nanoparticles. Although, several other methods are reported, still have limited to metal loading lesser than 10 wt%. [356][357][358] Very few reports are published with the metal loading greater than 10 wt%. [73,180,359,360] Despite the satisfactory progress in the synthesis of dense SACs, it remains difficult to control the type and distribution of active sites. 3. Thermal stability of SACs: Thermal stability of SACs is a big issue and utilization of SACs at elevated temperature is highly desired. [192,361] To keep them isolated, the operational temperature is typically kept below 300 °C. [362] Few examples were reported to explore SACs for industrial relevant high temperature (&gt;300 °C) gas-phase applications. [336,339,340,363] The thermal stability of SACs can be enhanced by strong interaction through a strong covalent metal-support interaction. [46] The controllable high-temperature shockwave strategy, [364] atom trapping, [365] and entropy-driven [366] methods were utilized to stabilize SA. Periodic on-off heating for short time (55 ms) allowed the formation of thermodynamically favorable strong metal-defect bonds. [364] Recently, temperature-induced structure reconstruction of support was explored to synthesize high-temperature stable SACs at 800 °C. [367] 4. Fundamental understanding of SACs (atomic level information): SACs have been widely employed for many reactions and now seem clear that supported metal atoms can effectively catalyzed challenging reactions. Most of the reported to date particularly talk about the synthesis, stability, and increasing the metal loading, but how the coordination environment or structures of active site geometry affect overall performance is still an open question. [368] The coordination environments around the SA can be tuned by various heteroatom doping and by the use of different neighbor metal atoms which brings thousands of possibilities of different combinations.1.

        <p>During the catalyst preparation, homogenization of active sites is highly challenging, and as prepared catalyst always have varieties of active sites. It could be possible that different molecular sites have different activity and selectivity for the same reactions which are hard to estimate at the atomic level. Also, support metal interaction has a great impact on the catalytic properties, sometimes support atoms or surface functional groups help in stabilizing some of the intermediates, which help in facilitating the catalytic cycles. Surface sensitive techniques such as XPS could be useful and support of DFT modeling is also equally important. [369] 5. Use of electric vehicles for transport and personal uses: Due to the continuous decline of petroleum resources, it is necessary to quest for alternative electric vehicles; batteries are only a time-limited source of energy for now. Although extensive work has been done on improving different aspects of batteries low-cost; and recyclable; environmentally benign materials are a necessity. [261] Efficient and cost-effective SACs for metal-air batteries are needed to meet the battery's demand. 6. CO 2 capture and conversion at hot spot: Continuously increase of CO 2 levels in the environment is possessing danger for living beings. Direct air capture and postcombustion capture and conversion are highly demanded and millions of funds have been recently made available to develop an efficient and workable technology to deal with CO 2 . Although many industries focus on capture and storage, this is not a viable long-term solution. We should capture CO 2 and parallel convert into value-added products such as fuel or polymer. [370] Recently many reports have been published highlighting SACs for CO 2 conversion, [371] but none of them met the industrial requirement, which needs to be focused on more. [372] 7. Capture CO 2 using a solid electrochemical system: An electrochemical cell is a device of solid capture media with the electrode assembly, which captures CO 2 when charged and released on discharge. Recently, an electrochemical setup for direct CO 2 capture has been demonstrated. It was able to capture low as 0.6% (6000 ppm) concentration of CO 2 . [373,374] Al Sadat and Archer demonstrated an O 2 -assisted Al/CO 2 electrochemical cell as a new strategy for CO 2 capture, which can at the same time be generated a substantial amount of electric energy. [375] The cathode provides a valuable C 2 species and electric energy. The first cell reduced O 2 to superoxide intermediate and simultaneously reacted with CO 2 in the form of aluminum oxalate Al 2 (C 2 O 4 ) 3 , as a dominant product. This process may be possible to accelerate using SACs doped Alcathode. 8. Electrocatalyst for NO X and SO x : A catalytic converter is a catalytic device attached to exhaust and convert harmful gases such as NO X , CO, and VOC in N 2 , O 2 , and CO 2 . In this series, a selective catalytic converter (SCR) is an advanced emission control device that injects a liquid-reductant agent into the exhaust stream to reduce the level of NO X in the exhaust. SCR selective use ammonia to convert NO X to N 2 and O 2 . Mostly these catalysts are made of Rh, Pt, and Pd; the catalytic activity may further be accelerated by developing an SACs solid electrolyte cell. [376] Recently, direct reduction of NO with CO into N 2 and CO 2 using Ni-SACs investigated using a theoretical model. [377] 9. Dechlorination of environmental contamination: Organics like chloromethane, methylene chloride, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride are the major solvents used by paint and Pharmaceutical industries worldwide. The excessive release of the solvent into the environment not only harms our health but also dramatically affects the ozone layer by a catalytic chain reaction. A heterogeneous catalyst is used for dechlorination of water and air, which can be further improved by developing SACs. This process can be further accelerated by using electrochemical cells.
