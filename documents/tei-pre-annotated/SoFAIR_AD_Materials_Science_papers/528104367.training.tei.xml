        <p>This study investigates the thermal and kinetic analysis of six diverse biomass fuels, in order to provide valuable information for power and energy generation. Pyrolytic, combustion and kinetic analyses of barley straw, miscanthus, waste wood, wheat straw, short rotation coppicing (SRC) willow and wood pellet were examined by non-isothermal thermogravimetry analyser (TGA), differential thermogravimetric (DTG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) techniques. Biomass fuels were thermally degraded under N2, air, CO2 and the selected oxyfuel (30% O2/ 70% CO2) reaction environments. The thermal degradation under inert N2 and CO2 atmospheres showed an almost identical rate of weight loss (R), reactivity (RM ×10 3 ) and activation energy (Ea) profiles. Similar profiles for R, RM and Ea were observed for the environments under air (21% O2/ 79% N2) and the oxy-fuel combustion. Results indicated that the thermal decomposition rate for biomass fuels in an oxidising condition was faster than in an inert atmosphere, favourable effect on thermal degradation of biomass fuels was observed when oxygen content increased from 21 to 30%. Higher activation energies with lower reactivity were observed for the biomass fuels that have low cellulosic contents as compared to the other fuels. Regression analysis confirmed that the reaction order 0.5 modelled fitted well for all biomass samples. All these findings will provide valuable information and promote the advancement of future researches in this field.This study investigates the thermal and kinetic analysis of six diverse biomass fuels, in order to provide valuable information for power and energy generation.

        <p>There is a crucial requisite of global alteration from coal energy to renewable bio-energy sources [1]. As carbon-negative and renewable origin of bio-energy, biomass fuels can play a chief role. Biomass energy, a form of solar energy stored in plant matter, is considered to be environmental friendly and carbon-neutral if the consumption and growth of the biomass are kept in balance. When CO2 emissions produced from biomass utilisation is captured and stored, negative carbon emissions can be achieved. Biomass fuels are also often regarded as the cleaner fuel for power generation as they tend to have appreciably lower sulphur contents than fossil fuels [2]. Furthermore, biomass fuels can be used to deliver controllable energy that is free from the problem of intermittency which is inherent with the wind and solar energies.There is a crucial requisite of global alteration from coal energy to renewable bio-energy sources [1].

        <p>Therefore, biomasses are the potential major future renewable energy resources, with developed bio-energy systems being considered as vital contributors to future sustainable energy production [3,4]. Pyrolysis is an important fundamental process that can be used to study the thermochemical conversion of biomasses into the biomass char and gaseous or liquid fuels [5]. It is also used to improve gasification, fixed carbon content, calorific value and combustion processes. The combustion process is of great significance in boilers and furnaces, that's why a sound knowledge of this process is required to determine the feasibility of the biomass fuel [6,7]. In addition, kinetic study is considered as an important criteria for the measurement of reactivity and combustibility potentials of the biomass fuels. Pyrolytic and combustion characteristics of the biomass fuels have been studied mostly with thermogravimetric analyser (TGA) in literature with a focus on a range of working reactant environment for thermal degradation [8]. TGA has also been used to identify different polymeric lignocellulosic fractions present in biomass residues and to determine the reactivities of char residues in the presence of active atmospheres of interest [9].Therefore, biomasses are the potential major future renewable energy resources, with developed bio-energy systems being considered as vital contributors to future sustainable energy production [3,4].

        <p>The kinetic parameters derived from TGA analysis are used to design combustors, pyrolysis reactors and gasifiers. Mansaray and Ghaly [10], investigated the thermal decomposition profile of four rice husk selections using TGA, under N2 at three different heating rates. Direct increase in thermal degradation with increasing heat rates was observed in their research. On the other hand, lower the cellulosic amount of the biomass, the lower the temperature noted for its decomposition. Moreover, the greater the cellulose amount the greater thermal degradation rate and the higher the initial degradation temperatures. Munir et al. [11] studied nonisothermal degradation and devolatilisation kinetics of four biomass fuels including shea meal, two different sugarcane bagasse residues and cotton stalk under an inert N2 and oxidising (21% O2/ 79% N2) environment conditions. They found that the cotton stalk was the reactive biomass in comparison to other, under both environments, whereas Shea meal was the least reactive biomass in inert environment because of its low amount of volatile matter and low oxygen to carbon ratio value. However, the generation of complex char under oxidant combustion by Shea meal was indicative of different types of char resulting from fibrous and woody constituents in the original biomass.The kinetic parameters derived from TGA analysis are used to design combustors, pyrolysis reactors and gasifiers.

        <p>Fig. 1a shows the weight loss profiles of the selected biomass fuels during the non-isothermal TGA tests under N2. It is well known that cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin are the major natural polymeric components of the biomass fuels. But different kinds of biomass contain varying types and proportions of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and a small amount of other extractives. The thermal decomposition of the main organic components of the biomass generates oxygenated by-products. As the temperature gradually increases, these by-products reach their spontaneous ignition and the released heat contributes to the decomposition of the remaining organic matter [11]. Such behaviour can also be observed in Fig. 1a respectively. This variation in devolatilisation temperatures could be related to different elemental and chemical compositions of these biomass fuels [38].Fig. 1a shows the weight loss profiles of the selected biomass fuels during the non-isothermal TGA tests under N2.

        <p>Quantitative assessment of polymeric components of biomasses was examined using differential thermogravimetric (DTG) plots of biomasses under N2. Pyrolysis of biomass under inert atmosphere can be divided into three stages; first moisture evolution, then devolatilisation and finally continuous slight devolatilisation [39]. The DTG plots of biomasses under N2 are represented in Fig. 1b. It is difficult to clearly distinguish between hemicellulose and cellulose devolatilisation regions for WW in contrast to other fuels (i.e. SRC; BS; MIS). This is due to the inhomogeneous nature of this mixed original woody-biomass sample. At the end of the major peak the slow degradation over a wider temperature range continues to produce pyrolysis residue reaching to a constant ratio, sometimes referred to as long tailing section [11,39]. The maximum rates of weight loss (wt% /min) were 16, 17.4, 17.7, 14.9, 19.3 and 19% for BS, MIS, WW, WS, SRC and WP respectively. These weight loss rates were found to be higher for the fuels with higher volatile matter and lower ash contents [11]. The thermal degradation results under N2 are presented in Table S1. the lignin content, the slower the biomass devolatilisation [40]. The temperature range of lignin devolatilisation cannot be discerned from, which often has a broad peak temperature overlapping that of cellulose decomposition [41]. It is evaluated and reported [42], that DTG method gives comparable results than the other available common methods (holocellulose extraction, cellulose extraction, neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre and acid detergent lignin). All experimentations were performed side by side for comparison. Moreover, the DTG method is cost effective, easier to implement and faster than the above mentioned wet chemical analyses. Therefore, in this study hemicellulose and cellulose contents of biomass fuels are calculated from DTG curves using a method shown in Fig. 2 and presented in Table 2, along with those reported elsewhere. The criteria for division of area under the DTG curve was the observed two shoulders. The DTG plot in Fig. 2 shows the apparent two-stage (two shoulders) release of the first hemicellulose (low temperature) and then cellulose (high temperature). This temperature dependent release of cellulosic components is in accordance with the literature [42]. Weight loss under the first shoulder (shaded blue) in the first DTG peak corresponds to hemicellulose contents and the weight loss under the main DTG peak (shaded red) corresponds to cellulose contents. Due to the difficulties to measure lignin content, an error of +/-11% can be attributed to this study's results as compared with other published results. *Anticipated wt% loss attributed to hemicellulose and cellulose calculated from DTG.Quantitative assessment of polymeric components of biomasses was examined using differential thermogravimetric (DTG) plots of biomasses under N2. Pyrolysis of biomass under inert atmosphere can be divided into three stages; first moisture evolution, then devolatilisation and finally continuous slight devolatilisation [39]. The DTG plots of biomasses under N2 are represented in Fig. 1b. It is difficult to clearly distinguish between hemicellulose and cellulose devolatilisation regions for WW in contrast to other fuels (i.e. SRC; BS; MIS). This is due to the inhomogeneous nature of this mixed original woody-biomass sample. At the end of the major peak the slow degradation over a wider temperature range continues to produce pyrolysis residue reaching to a constant ratio, sometimes referred to as long tailing section [11,39]. The maximum rates of weight loss (wt% /min) were 16, 17.4, 17.7, 14.9, 19.3 and 19% for BS, MIS, WW, WS, SRC and WP respectively. These weight loss rates were found to be higher for the fuels with higher volatile matter and lower ash contents [11]. The thermal degradation results under N2 are presented in Table S1. the lignin content, the slower the biomass devolatilisation [40]. The temperature range of lignin devolatilisation cannot be discerned from, which often has a broad peak temperature overlapping that of cellulose decomposition [41]. It is evaluated and reported [42], that DTG method gives comparable results than the other available common methods (holocellulose extraction, cellulose extraction, neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre and acid detergent lignin). All experimentations were performed side by side for comparison. Moreover, the DTG method is cost effective, easier to implement and faster than the above mentioned wet chemical analyses. Therefore, in this study hemicellulose and cellulose contents of biomass fuels are calculated from DTG curves using a method shown in Fig. 2 and presented in Table 2, along with those reported elsewhere. The criteria for division of area under the DTG curve was the observed two shoulders. The DTG plot in Fig. 2 shows the apparent two-stage (two shoulders) release of the first hemicellulose (low temperature) and then cellulose (high temperature). This temperature dependent release of cellulosic components is in accordance with the literature [42]. Weight loss under the first shoulder (shaded blue) in the first DTG peak corresponds to hemicellulose contents and the weight loss under the main DTG peak (shaded red) corresponds to cellulose contents. Due to the difficulties to measure lignin content, an error of +/-11% can be attributed to this study's results as compared with other published results. *Anticipated wt% loss attributed to hemicellulose and cellulose calculated from DTG.</p>
        <p>While the comparison with other studies [44,[46][47][48][49] based on a common method for determination of polymeric lignocellulosic components, it is proved that the values predicted by using present DTG technique were comparable. Previous studies on biomass have shown that cellulose comprises 40-50% compared to 20-40% of hemicellulose and 10-40% lignin [50]. The relative proportions of cellulose and lignin are two of the determining factors in identifying the suitability of biomass fuels for the energy production process since the ratio of cellulose to lignin dictates the rates of thermal decomposition [40]. The final pyrolysis residues were in the range of 14.3 to 21.7% that comprised of unburnt char and ash.While the comparison with other studies [44,[46][47][48][49] based on a common method for determination of polymeric lignocellulosic components, it is proved that the values predicted by using present DTG technique were comparable.

The maximum rate of weight loss during char combustion was found to be 9.47% for SRC. The SRC rate of weight loss during combustion is the highest among all other fuels with the highest cellulose contents about 60%.

        <p>The thermal behaviour of biomass fuels under CO2 is shown in Fig. 4. It is evident from Fig. 1a, that when N2 is used, the end point of devolatilisation cannot be found after the residence time of the isotherm condition. On the other hand, the use of CO2 (Fig. 4a) highly improves the trend towards reaching a mass loss plateau in the isothermal step and enables the distinction and quantification of the volatile material and fixed carbon contents in biomass samples.The thermal behaviour of biomass fuels under CO2 is shown in Fig. 4.

        <p>According to Borrego and Alvarez [53], the use of CO2 as a carrier gas provides higher resistance to the devolatilisation of bulk components of biomass in relation to N2. This resistance may be due to the involvement of CO2 in the cross-linking reaction on the char surface, which reduces the deformation and clumps its carbonaceous structure.According to Borrego and Alvarez [53], the use of CO2 as a carrier gas provides higher resistance to the devolatilisation of bulk components of biomass in relation to N2.

The average temperatures for devolatilisation region being higher under CO2 flow than N2 (Table 4). The difference in the values of specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity for CO2 and N2 influences the degradation/ combustion characteristics of the fuels. It has been found that combustion temperatures are substantially affected by replacement of N2 with CO2 with/ without the presence of oxygen [54,55]. Thus, replacing N2 with CO2 would adversely effects the energy input required for biomass combustion applications.The onset of devolatilisation was seen to occur at higher temperatures in the presence of CO2 compared to N2 which is shown in Fig. 4b.

Among all the studied fuels, the maximum rate of weight loss (Rmax); lowest 28% for WW and the highest 47.4% for MIS were observed in the first reaction zone. These weight losses were slightly higher than under air condition (except BS and WW), e.g. 2.5% for MIS, 0.5% for WS, 3.5% for SRC and 3% for WP. The difference in the degradation temperatures and rate of weight loss is due to the difference in cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin contents of biomass samples; this fact is extensively reported in the literature [58]. Similar overlapping zone as under air was observed, but with higher temperature ranges. The 453 anticipated overlapping temperature ranges were found as 95, 55, 50, 25, 80 and 65 °C for BS, 454 MIS, WW, WS, SRC and WP respectively. This higher degree overlapping may be attributed 455 to higher oxygen contents in oxidising gas as compared to air. It is also supported by the literature that char combustion time increases in relation to the pyrolysis under low oxygen contents and relative time of overlapping reduces as under air [51]. The second weight loss zone is attributed with char combustion within the temperature range of 315-535 °C. Similarly, as in the first reaction zone, WS char combustion is taking place before all the other fuels at 315 °C and WP on the end at 435 °C.

The investigated biomass fuels include woody (waste wood, wood pellets), non-woody (miscanthus, wheat straw) and special type (short rotation coppicing (SRC willow). Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses were performed under four different reaction environments including; N2, air, CO2 and the oxy-fuel (30% O2/70% CO2).

        <p>The mass loss that was observed to occur over a broad range, relatively higher temperature region marked as region A in Fig. 3b, between 385 to 540 o C. This is believed to correspond to the char combustion zone. The anticipated char (also have ash) contents of 22.5, 23.5, 30, 19.5 and 24% attributed between temperature regions 360-460, 390-510, 340-570, 410-510 and 410-540 o C for MIS, WW, WS, SRC and WP respectively. Under oxy-fuel, higher reactivity values were noticed as compared to all other reactive environments. Temperature range from 200 to 415 o C and 680 to 950 o C are attributed as devolatilisation and char-CO2 reaction zones respectively.

        <p>For comparative analysis based on the values of RM the fuel samples may be ranked as SRC&gt;MIS&gt;WP&gt;BS&gt;WW&gt;WS under N2 and CO2 , but under CO2 the RM values are slightly higher than as under N2. Similarly these values are greater under oxy-fuel as compared to air and show a trend as MIS&gt;BS&gt;WS&gt;SRC&gt;WP&gt;WW. For air the trend is as BS&gt;MIS&gt;WS&gt;SRC&gt;WP&gt;WW. Under above mentioned conditions different trends were observed but there is a small and comparable difference between their RM values. As under N2 SRC willow exhibited high RM value of 0.53, whereas the next fuel with high RM is MIS (0.51) and this biomass fuel is exhibited high RM under oxy-fuel combustion reactivity analysis. RM value of 1.60 is observed for BS under air, while this fuel at the first rank under air and at second rank under oxy-fuel analysis. RM values under oxy-fuel were observed to be higher than those under air, a phenomenon which is also supported by [59], and one of the reasons this process is valued as an alternative to conventional combustion.For comparative analysis based on the values of RM the fuel samples may be ranked as SRC&gt;MIS&gt;WP&gt;BS&gt;WW&gt;WS under N2 and CO2 , but under CO2 the RM values are slightly higher than as under N2.

        <p>With an increase in oxygen concentration, the apparent energy barriers decrease resulting in lower values of Ea for both volatile and char combustion zones. However, in the present case, after replacing N2 with CO2 under oxy-fuel the apparent barrier towards the volatile and char combustion reaction zone increases resulting in relatively higher values of Ea. This could be partly due to the physical properties of CO2 in oxy-fuel. The rest of the apparent Ea values found to be nearly synchronised with existing literature [11]. Therefore, Table 4 values are supported and verified from Table 3 values. According to Ea and reactivity profile trend under N2, the most reactive biomass with the least activation energy is SRC and the least reactive with high activation energy is WS. A significantly similar type of results under other experimental conditions were observed.With an increase in oxygen concentration, the apparent energy barriers decrease resulting in lower values of Ea for both volatile and char combustion zones.

        <p>Heat flow and mass transfer rates of the biomass fuels were determined under N2 and air reaction environments. Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 show the experimental DSC thermograms of biomass fuels under N2 and air respectively. To detect the endothermic and exothermic nature of the reactions heat transfer analyses were performed. From DSC results, it was observed that the thermograms went from endothermic reactions to very minor exothermic ones. The first region of endothermic peaks was noted up to 300 o C, then very minor exothermic peaks were observed up to 700 o C. The peaks above 300 o C can be attributed to the degradation of the lignocellulosic components [2]. After this, the fuels were degraded again in the endothermic region. These thermograms ensured that all biomass fuels were degraded under endothermic region without the effect of self-heating [2]. Fig. 8b shows the mass transfer rates of the fuels under N2. All fuels show relatively slow (pyrolysis) mass conversion under N2 than air (combustion) (Fig. 9b), these results are in agreement with [60]. Fig. 9a shows that thermograms went from endothermic to exothermic reactions when the temperature increased above 280 o C.
