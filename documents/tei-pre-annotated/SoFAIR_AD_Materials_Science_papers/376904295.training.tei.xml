        <p>Conversion of carbon-di-oxide into selective hydrocarbon using stable catalyst remains a holy-grail in catalysis community. The high overpotential, stability, and selectivity in use of a single metal-based catalyst still remain a challenge. In current work, instead of using pure noble metals (Ag, Au, and Pt) as the catalyst, a nanocrystalline high entropy alloy (HEA: AuAgPtPdCu) has been used for conversion of CO 2 into gaseous hydrocarbons. Utilizing an approach of multi-metallic HEA, a Faradaic efficiency of about 100% towards gaseous products is obtained at the lowest applied potential (-0.3 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode). The reason behind the superior catalytic activity and selectivity of high entropy alloy (HEA) towards CO 2 electroreduction was established through first-principles based density functional theory (DFT) by comparing it with pristine Cu (111) surface. This is attributed to the reversal in adsorption trends for two out of the total eight intermediates -* OCH 3 and * O on Cu(111) and HEA surfaces.Conversion of carbon-di-oxide into selective hydrocarbon using stable catalyst remains a holy-grail in catalysis community.

        <p>The noble-metal catalysts such as Au, Ag, Pt, Pd, have been demonstrated to convert CO 2 to carbon monoxide with high selectivity [10][11][12][13][14] . Platinum (Pt), generally considered as the active electrocatalyst for all the electrochemical reactions, generates H 2 exclusively instead of CO 2 reduction in the aqueous medium. Additionally, it is easily poisoned by CO 5 . Recently, copper (Cu) has gained more attention and focus because of its ability to convert CO 2 into higher hydrocarbon fuels [15][16][17][18] . However, copper-based materials show limited selectivity due to significant hydrogen generation. Interestingly, the bimetallic alloys of this element show an improvement in catalytic activity and selectivity however, CO and H 2 forms in most of the cases with high faradaic efficiency. [19][20][21][22] . The nanomaterials catalysts with substitution of few atoms shows selective conversion of CO 2 to carbon fuel 23 . Recently, high entropy alloys (HEAs), a simple solid solution phase, have been studied as multifunctional materials by tuning their thermal, electrical, magnetic and catalytic properties. [24][25][26][27] Their potential applications in electrocatalysis of oxygen reduction reaction 25 , methanol 26 , and hydrogen evolution reaction 27 have been reported. These multicomponent "cocktails" with simple crystal structure (FCC, BCC or HCP) can effectively be utilized for various functional applications, notably catalytic applications as their composition and constituents can be tuned for specific applications. This can be done by preparing HEA containing catalytically active metals. Such kind of approach opens new area of single atom catalysts 9,28 . These HEAs are in general highly active and used without any support but it is possible to disperse them on a support to increase the activity further utilizing the phenomenon of metal support interaction. [29][30] Here, a unique catalyst based on combination of five active metals (Au, Ag, Pt, Pd and Cu) high entropy alloy has been developed as a 'single atom catalyst' in which the Cu atoms are stabilized by other metals in a 'FCC-facet' crystalline structures (Figure 1a). A theoretical approach to finding the optimum composition using machine learning is described in detail in Part I: Theoretical Discovery of the present publication.

        <p>The HEA alloy has been synthesized using an easily scalable and precise composition control route of melting and cryogrinding 31 . The XRD pattern of synthesized HEA nanoparticles reveals formation of a single-phase with face-centered cubic structure (FCC) having lattice parameter 0.3936 nm as shown in Figure 1b. Similarly, the nanocrystalline FCC structure was proven by electron diffraction ring pattern. These nanoparticles show average size of 16±10 nm as shown in Figure 1c. The HR-STEM image shown in Figure 1d reveals 001 lattice arrangements with different intensity of individual lattice, which can be assigned to different atoms. All elements (Au, Ag, Pd, Pt, and Cu) were homogeneously distributed or alloyed in single phase FCC matrix, which is proven by atom probe tomography (APT) as shown in Figure 1e, indicating homogeneous distribution of elements at atomic level. The HEA contains five elements. Therefore, interatomic effects (atoms surrounding) as well as surface oxidation of nanoparticles were revealed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

        <p>The XPS spectra of the HEAs are shown in Figure 1f. The Pt(4f) core level shows two peaks at 71.1 (Pt4f 7/2 ) and 74.4 (Pt4f 5/2 ) eV similar to bulk Pt 33 . Au(4f) core level spectra show two peaks at 84.0 eV and 88.0 eV related to Au(4f 7/2 ) and Au(4f 5/2 ) respectively. This is again similar to bulk Au. Similarly, the binding energy (B.E.) of Pd and Cu confirms the pure metallic characteristic with binding energies similar to their bulk counterpart. Small amount of Cu 2+ is also observed in the XPS. B.E. for Ag3d 5/2 which appears at 367.8 eV, 0.4 eV lower than metallic Ag. Clearly, there is some intrinsic charge transfer between Ag and Cu. This phenomenon is consistent with the XPS of bimetallic Au-Ag alloy as well 34 . The XPS is surface sensitive technique which gives information from few atomic layers (in depth) and Figure 1f confirmed that the AuAgPtPdCu is chemically homogeneous high entropy alloy at the surfaces of nanoparticles, which is the key for catalytic activities of NPs. Similarly, XRD and APT also proved crystal structure and overall composition respectively. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) behavior of HEA coated glassy carbon at 40 mV s -1 in 0.5 M K 2 SO 4 is shown in Figure 2. The observed CV showed a prominent redox peak (A1/C1) at -0.13 and -0.32 V (Figure 2a) corresponding to Cu 2+ /Cu 0 redox reaction 20 . Apart from the redox peak (A1/C1), the oxidation and reduction peaks at 0.42 (A2) and 0.25V (C2) also appear, typical of Pt and Au metal behavior [35][36] . Once the potential range is restricted to the negative side (0.0 to -1.0 V), the peak A1 becomes broad and appear with a shoulder.The XPS spectra of the HEAs are shown in Figure 1f.

        <p>Corresponding reduction peak (C1) does not appear in this potential range confirming the incomplete surface oxidation. Presence of the redox peak related to Cu 2+ /Cu 0 proves that this species can play a critical role in the catalytic activity. Therefore, the electro-reduction of CO 2 is selected as copper is the most active catalyst for this reaction 4,15,[19][20] . Experiments are carried out at 20 mV s -1 in the potential range of 0.0 to -1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The CO 2 reduction starts above -0.5 V, where current density raises rapidly up to -0.8 V and then decreases forming a peak at -0.8V. At -0.8V, the cathodic current density is 10.15 mAcm -2 , ~5 times higher than the N 2 saturated solution (2.2 mAcm -2 ). These observations confirm the significant activity of HEA for CO 2 electroreduction. The corresponding current efficiency (CE %) for electroreduction of CO 2 at different potentials are calculated using equation S1. The highest current efficiency (81.8%) is achieved at -0.8 V (inset of Figure 2b). It is interesting to note that the electrochemical reduction CO 2 is usually carried out in a basic electrolyte such as NaHCO 3 . However, in the case of HEA, CO 2 saturated NaHCO 3 (0.5 M) did not yield any activity (Supporting Figure S1(a)). Presently, the reason is unknown, but one can speculate the pH-dependent activity of HEA. Steady-state current responses of HEA in CO 2 saturated electrolyte at a various potential (-0.7, -0.8 and -0.9V) is also shown in Figure 2c. Obtained steady state current densities are -6.83 mAcm -2 (at -0.7V), -10.31 mAcm -2 (at -0.8V) and -13.81 mAcm -2 (at -0.9 V), respectively. A bar diagram indicating the impressive CO 2 electroreduction activity of HEA at -0.9 V, is shown in the inset of Figure 2c. The major gaseous products on HEA are CO, CH 4 , C 2 H 4 and H 2 , similar to the copper-based electrocatalysts 37 . It is worth noticing that in spite of many elements present in the catalyst, the catalytic effect is depicted only by the copper confirming that other elements are only providing the synergistic effect. Faradaic efficiencies (FE %), calculated as per the equation (S2), are shown in Figure 2d. FE % of CO was ~7 %, at-0.7 V which deceased to 4.0% at -0.9 V. Comparatively, the formation of CH 4 and C 2 H 4 was predominantly occurred with FE % up to 49.4% and 19.9 % (at -0.7V), 42.9 % and 26.6 % (at -0.8 V) and 38.0% and 29.5% (at -0.9 V), respectively. The FE % for hydrogen on HEA catalyst is about 26.4% which does not change significantly at other potentials. Importantly, the total faradaic efficiency is 100 % for the gaseous products combined at the lowest applied potential, i.e., -0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl (-0.3 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode). This confirms that there is zero or negligible liquid product formation highlighting the unique capability of HEA catalyst. A detailed catalytic activity comparison of HEA with other reported catalysts is given in Table S1 (in supporting information). One can notice that HEA performs the best in terms of low applied voltage and striking hydrocarbon efficiency. Long term stability of HEA is studied using chronoamperometry for 5 hours in K 2 SO 4 solution (Figure S1(b)). Electrolyte is continuously bubbled with CO 2 during the experiment. Initially, current decreases reaching a steady state, which remains constant for 5 hours.

        <p>To gain an insight into the reaction, we have performed DFT calculations. We compared the catalytic activity of the multicomponent HEA with Cu to bring about the salient features of the HEA as catalysts for CO 2 RR. The aim is to provide the mechanisms for excellent catalytic activity of HEA. The optimized lattice parameters of Cu are found to be, a = b = c = 3.63 Å (Figure S2a), which is in excellent agreement with the previous reports 38 . The (111) facet was chosen for calculations, as it is the most stable facet of the FCC metals. The supercell size of the Cu (111) surface was selected as 5x3x1 to get all the possible adsorbing sites, which are also present in the HEAs (Figure S2 andS3(a)). The unit cell of HEAs contained 120 atoms, with the constituent elements -Pt, Pd, Ag, Au and Cu, being equal in proportion (20 % each). The method for generation of the structure of HEA utilized in the present study is described in detail in the supporting information file. Based on experimental composition, the Au:Ag:Pt:Pd:Cu=1:1:1:1:1composition was chosen for simulations.

The values of zero-point energies and entropies for the intermediates and reference molecules have been taken from the reported literature 39 . The complete free-energy reaction profile for This barrier is also the theoretical limiting potential for the reduction reaction on pristine Cu surface, as at U = -1.91 V, all the elementary steps become exoergic. We then extended this thermodynamic study to the HEA system. In this case, there is a possibility of a large number of catalytic centers due to the five elements being present randomly on the sur face. In order to mitigate this problem, we chose only one catalytic center from electronic principles of designing catalyst, i.e., based on position of d-band center (E dBC ).

Hence it was chosen as the catalytic center for CO 2 RR study.</p>
        <p>Pd 11 is also adjacent to a Cu atom on the surface (Cu However, the barriers in this system are reduced significantly, e.g., 0.73 eV for the 3rd elementary step and 1.35 eV for the 6th elementary step. Hence, at a potential of -1.35 V, the reaction profile becomes downhill in energy. The free energy profile of Cu (111) surface is also plotted at the same potential in Figure 3 To confirm whether the CO 2 RR activity on HEA follows the trend in d-band center, we carried out same free energy calculations on the Cu 7 active site also (Figure S9). In this case, two steps have almost similar barriers (*COOH to *CO and *OCH 3 to *O), however, the *OCH 3 to *O step has slightly higher barrier (1.54 eV), leading to a limiting potential of -1.54 V. Therefore, Cu 7 is less active than Pd 11 site on account of its lower limiting potential(limiting potential of Pd 11 = -1.35 V).This trend is, therefore, in agreement with the trend intheir respective d-band centers 42 .Further, to understand the selectivity of different products observed in the experiments (Table S1), we calculated free energy diagrams for CO (Figure S10) and H 2 (Figure S11) evolution reactions on Pd 11 site of HEA. Although, limiting potential for CO evolution is higher than that of CH 4 formation, however, free energy adsorption of CO is -1.01 eV, which is highly exothermic. This makes CO difficult to be desorbed from the surface of HEA, and hence experimental Faradaic efficiency for CO is very low (4.9%).Moreover, free energy adsorption of H 2 is -0.45 eV, while for efficient HER catalysts, this value is usually thermoneutral, i.e., |ΔG ads (H)|≈0 41 . Hence, Au-Ag-Pt-Pd-Cu HEA is selective for hydrocarbon products rather than hydrogen in agreement with the trend in experimental Faradaic efficiency, which is lowerfor H 2 than that of CH 4 and C 2 H 4 (Table S1).Pd 11 is also adjacent to a Cu atom on the surface (Cu However, the barriers in this system are reduced significantly, e.g., 0.73 eV for the 3rd elementary step and 1.35 eV for the 6th elementary step.

Therefore, Cu 7 is less active than Pd 11 site on account of its lower limiting potential(limiting potential of Pd 11 = -1.35 V).This trend is, therefore, in agreement with the trend intheir respective d-band centers 42 .Further, to understand the selectivity of different products observed in the experiments (Table S1), we calculated free energy diagrams for CO (Figure S10) and H 2 (Figure S11) evolution reactions on Pd 11 site of HEA. Although, limiting potential for CO evolution is higher than that of CH 4 formation, however, free energy adsorption of CO is -1.01 eV, which is highly exothermic. This makes CO difficult to be desorbed from the surface of HEA, and hence experimental Faradaic efficiency for CO is very low (4.9%).Moreover, free energy adsorption of H 2 is -0.45 eV, while for efficient HER catalysts, this value is usually thermoneutral, i.e., |ΔG ads (H)|≈0 41 . Hence, Au-Ag-Pt-Pd-Cu HEA is selective for hydrocarbon products rather than hydrogen in agreement with the trend in experimental Faradaic efficiency, which is lowerfor H 2 than that of CH 4 and C 2 H 4 (Table S1).</p>

        <p>* O intermediate on the HEA surface, compared to the Cu (111) surface. The extra stabilization of * O intermediate on the HEA surface may be because both Pd 11 and Cu 7 atoms are bonded to the O atom. This behavior can be explained from the partial density of states (PDOS) plotted in Figures S7 and S8 for * OCH 3 and * O intermediates, respectively.
