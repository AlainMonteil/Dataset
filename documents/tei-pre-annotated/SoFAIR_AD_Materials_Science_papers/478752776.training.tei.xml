        <p>Upscaling efficient and stable perovskite light absorption layers is one of the most challenging issues in developing the next generation of photovoltaics for commercialization. Herein, we demonstrate a lead halide templated crystallization strategy for deposition of large-area compact and stable methylammonium (MA)-free perovskite films towards printable high-performance solar modules. High-quality large-area formamidinium (FA)-cesium (Cs) lead-triiodide perovskite films are achieved via controlled crystal growth of lead-halide•N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) adduct. The adduct can react in situ with embedded FAI/CsI to directly form α-phase</p>
        <p>perovskites to sidestep the phase transformation from δ-phase. The quality of the obtained perovskite films is further improved by incorporating a novel additive, potassium hexafluorophosphate (KPF6). Incorporation of KPF6 not only eliminates hysteresis but also enhances thermal stability by passivating interfacial defects. The modified devices feature a hysteresis-free high efficiency of over 23% with an excellent long-term thermal stability (@85℃) without encapsulation in ambient air (~80% efficiency retention after 500 hours). The slot-die printed mini-modules achieve champion efficiencies of 20.42% (certified efficiency 19.3%) and 19.54% with the active area of 17.1 cm 2 and 65.0 cm 2 , respectively.</p>
        <p>Hybrid organic-inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted intensive interest during the last decade with the power conversion efficiency (PCE) boosting over 25% (1). Such a development is attributed to the intrinsically superior photoelectric properties of the perovskite materials that possess tunable bandgap, high absorption coefficient, and long carrier diffusion lengths (2)(3)(4). In particular, the PSCs can be fabricated via a myriad of low-cost solution processes, which offers great promise for future commercialization. However, scalability and stability issues have impeded its industrialization.</p>
        <p>The most important prerequisite for fabricating large-area PSCs is the deposition of high-quality perovskite thin films. The nucleation and crystal growth of the perovskite in solution are largely uncontrollable, often leading to a porous film that would greatly impair the devices' performance (5,6). The larger the area is, the harder it will be to achieve a uniform crystalline film. Various efforts have been devoted to controlling the nucleation and crystal growth for scaling up perovskite films. Many strategies, including anti-solvent bathing (7), softcover coating (8), gas flow (9), vacuum (10) or thermal assisting (11), and additive engineering (12) have been successfully used to fabricate high-quality large-area perovskite films. For example, Hu et al. employed an air-blade to quickly remove the solvent of the MAPbI3 perovskite wet film to promote the concentration and induce a higher nucleation rate, forming a dense perovskite film (13). Huang et al. reported a thermal assist blade-coated perovskite film with an efficiency of 14.6% on 57.2 cm 2 perovskite solar modules (PSMs) using a surfactant added MAPbI3-xClx perovskite ink (11).</p>
        <p>However, MAPbI3 perovskites have shown poor stability at high temperatures or under light illumination (14,15). Instead, the MA-free perovskites such as FAPbI3 or (FACs)PbI3 show promising thermal stability due to their higher phase transformation temperatures (16)(17)(18). In addition, the narrower optical bandgap of FAPbI3 with respect to that of MAPbI3 can contribute to higher efficiencies (19). Recently, the FA-based PSCs without MA have attracted intensive attention, especially for large-area devices (20). Unfortunately, the nucleation and crystal growth of the FA-based perovskites are even harder to control. Alternatively, it might be feasible to control the nucleation of perovskite intermediates such as its solvent-coordinated complexes (9,21). However, it is found that the nucleation rate of solvent-coordinated FA-based perovskite complexes is still not high enough. Actually, besides the one-step method, the two-step method is also widely used in fabricating small-area perovskite films. It is rather easy to achieve a dense PbI2 film in the first step, but it is hard for the FAI deposited in the second step to diffuse into the bottom of the PbI2 film to induce a complete reaction (22). In the perovskite precursor solution, if the FAI and PbI2 species do not form perovskites or solvent-coordinated perovskite complexes, the nucleation will be dominated by PbI2 and therefore it will be easier to form a dense film. As FAI is embedded during the formation of the PbI2 film, it is easier to induce an in situ reaction between the PbI2 and FAI by the subsequent thermal annealing, resulting in a dense perovskite film. Thus, the crystallization of the perovskite is templated by the PbI2derived crystals.</p>
        <p>Herein, we report a lead halide templated crystallization strategy to prepare compact methylamine-free perovskite films for the fabrication of anti-solvent-free and ambientair printed high-performance PSMs. The key point to obtain high-quality large-area FAbased perovskite films is to completely inhibit the formation of solvent-coordinated perovskite intermediate complex via the formation of a stable PbI2•Nmethylpyrrolidone (NMP) adduct, which can react in situ with embedded FAI/CsI species. In addition, by this means we can lower the formation energy of α-phase perovskite that is an unstable high-temperature phase, thus convert the α-phase FAbased perovskite film (FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3) even at room temperature. The resulting perovskite films are further passivated by a novel KPF6 salt, which contributes to highperformance hysteresis-free perovskite solar cells with an efficiency of 23.35% and dramatically enhanced thermal and light stability. Eventually, a slot-die printed highquality large-area perovskite film is realized using this strategy. The corresponding solar mini-modules demonstrate efficiencies of 20.42% on 17.1 cm 2 and 19.54% on 65.0 cm 2 , respectively.</p>
        <p>FAPbI3 has the narrowest band-gap (~1.48 eV) among the Pb-based perovskites and much better thermal stability than MA-based perovskite. However, pure α-FAPbI3 is unstable, so Cs is normally introduced to stabilize the phase (23). Here FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3 perovskite is employed to study its nucleation and crystal growth kinetics. N,Ndimethylformamide (DMF) is a commonly used solvent for perovskite precursor ink due to its high solubility and volatility. It is found that during the natural drying process, only a few nuclei form at the beginning (fig. S1-i), then several flat needle-shaped crystals grow surrounding every nucleus. After drying completely, the SEM image (Fig. 1A-i) shows a rough film with dendrites, large pores, and some densely packed large grains lying underneath the dendrites, clearly indicating there are two types of structures.</p>
        <p>To trace the formation processes of such structures, in situ XRD is conducted to investigate phase change during the natural drying process. According to the DFT fitting (fig. S2) and comparing them with the in situ XRD patterns from different components with additives (fig. S3), it can be inferred from Fig. 1B-i 1C-i. There are some large area dense zones formed, with a few rods randomly distributed. So even with the assistance of solvent removal by spinning, the nucleation rate is not high enough, as there are still many large pores. This demonstrates it is hard to change the nucleation kinetics of FA-based perovskites through the approach of forming intermediate solvent-coordinated complexes. The XRD patterns (Fig. 1D-i) show the presence of major δ-(FACs)PbI3 in the final film.</p>
        <p>In our initial study, we found that NMP can form a strong PbI2•NMP adduct, (fig. S3, fig. S4B). As proposed, if PbI2•NMP can remain in the perovskite precursor solution, the nucleation will be dominated by the PbI2•NMP adduct. After the formation of the film, the FAI/CsI species are also homogenously distributed in the film. It is very easy to induce the reaction of PbI2 and FAI/CsI in the film by thermal annealing. Thus, the film morphology will be well controlled. Then the NMP with the molar ratio of 1:1 to PbI2 is added into the FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3/DMF solution. Similar studies are carried out and we find that there are two types of the nucleus (fig. S1-ii). The nuclei inducing the growth of needle-shaped crystals have no obvious change, but the length of the needle becomes a little shorter, indicating that the growth of the solvent-coordinated perovskite complexes is suppressed. More importantly, a large number of the second type of nuclei form, growing into spherical particles. Through the in situ XRD (Fig. 1B-ii), it is found that the initial strong peaks of FA2Pb3I8•4DMF become weaker and the later appeared PbI2•NMP peaks become stronger, leaving the final film consisting of FA2Pb3I8•4DMF and PbI2•NMP. The SEM image (Fig. 1A-ii) also shows in the rough film there are two types of structure, densely packed particles in the layered structure and some dendrite structure originated from the FA2Pb3I8•4DMF. When the film is prepared by spincoating the precursor solution at 3000 rpm, the film becomes smoother and denser, in a light brown color (fig. S5), but still having some small pores and several needles (Fig. 1C-ii). XRD patterns (Fig. 1D-ii) show the presence of almost pure PbI2•NMP phase.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, we also find that minor α-(FACs)PbI3 emerges in the film. When we increase the spinning speed to 5000 rpm, the peak intensity of α-phase becomes stronger (fig. S6). It is completely different from that of the film derived from the pure DMF solution. When the film is annealed at 70 ℃, α-(FACs)PbI3 phase appears obviously (Fig. 1D-ii), and the film becomes a black color (fig. S5). With further increase in annealing temperature to 150 ℃, the peak of α-phase becomes even stronger. For the DMF-derived film, when annealed at 70 ℃, the peak of δ-(FACs)PbI3 phase becomes stronger (Fig. 1D-i) and the film still remains a yellow color (fig. S5). However, when further annealed at 150 ℃, the δ-phase is completely transformed into α-phase (Fig. 1D-i) and becomes a black color (fig. S5). According to the DFT calculation (Fig. 1F), as α-FAPbI3 is a high-temperature phase, the conversion energy is high if it is from the δ-FAPbI3 which is transformed from the DMF coordinated complexes rapidly. However, when PbI2•NMP reacts with FAI to form perovskite, the α-FAPbI3 formation energy is dramatically decreased. This is why the addition of NMP can induce α-phase perovskite at room temperature with the incorporation of Cs. The study of pure FAPbI3 films growing from 2-methoxyethanol (2-Me), an uncoordinated solvent, with/without corresponding coordination solvent additives, further confirms the above findings as shown in fig. S7. In short, the presence of the intermediate phases (the perovskite-DMF complexes) will result in porous δ-phase perovskite films, while the existence of PbI2-NMP will directly produce dense α-phase perovskite films (fig. S4E). Therefore, an improved quality of perovskite film can be obtained by inhibiting the formation of the perovskite-DMF complexes. The excess PbI2 is generally beneficial to the device by the passivation (24).</p>
        <p>To study the corresponding films' device performance, we employed a normal structure of FTO/SnO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. To be feasible for industry, we adopt a two-step annealing process for perovskites, namely a 70 °C annealing in the glovebox to dry the films, followed by another 150 °C annealing in air to promote the crystal growth with the assistance of humidity. The champion J-V curves of PSCs are shown in fig. S9. The devices made from pure DMF-derived perovskite films exhibit a poor PCE of 7.64%, while the NMP engineered perovskite devices show a much higher efficiency over 20%. We further modulated the addition of PbCl2 and obtained mirrorlike black films (fig. S5). The efficiencies are improved significantly with the increasing amount of PbCl2 no more than 10%, while the hysteresis is keeping decreasing. A champion efficiency of 21.92% is achieved by the addition of 10% PbCl2 (fig. S9).</p>
        <p>After further characterization of the crystal properties by XRD, UV-Vis and SEM for the different amounts of PbCl2-containing perovskite films (fig. S10), It is found that the intrinsic reasons for the improved performance by introducing PbCl2 are the suppression of δ-phase formation, improvement of coverage with increased grain size, and the in situ formation of PbI2 at the grain boundary as a passivator (Fig. S10) due to the substitution of I -or I -vacancies by Cl -to form a FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3-xClx perovskite (25,26).</p>
        <p>To further improve the performance, we introduced a post-treatment of bromide based large cation salt (isobutylamine bromide, iBABr) on the as-fabricated FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3-xClx (labeled as 3D perovskite) surface to form a 3D/2D structured perovskite layer according to previous reports (27,28) (fig. S11), which would contribute to the stability improvement and Voc-loss reduction for the solar cells. The corresponding device structure is shown in Fig. 2A. An improved efficiency of 23.02% under reverse scan (RS) for the 3D/2D perovskite-based solar cells is achieved, with a Voc of 1.166 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 23.97 mA/cm 2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.824. A lower efficiency of 20.71% is achieved under forward scan (FS), with a Voc of 1.142 V, Jsc of 24.01 mA/cm 2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.755, respectively (Fig. 2B).</p>
        <p>An obvious hysteresis with a hysteresis index (HI) of 0.10 is still present.</p>
        <p>Hysteresis is related to the stability that is one of the major obstacles to the commercialization of PSCs (29). To eliminate the hysteresis and further improve the photovoltaic performance and stability, we employed a novel potassium-based salt, KPF6, as an additive to the perovskite precursor solution. XRD, UV-Vis and SEM characterizations (fig. S12) confirm the incorporation of KPF6 to perovskites. The corresponding photovoltaic characteristics are shown in fig. S13. With the addition of KPF6, the hysteresis is keeping decrease and the hysteresis index (HI) reaching to 0.00 at the concentration of 5% additives. To accurately evaluate the real PCE, steady-state power output (SPO) measurement is conducted. It can be found with the lower HI, the PCE from SPO becomes closer to the PCE from J-V scans. When the concentration is above 0.5%, the hysteresis is actually almost negligible. A champion efficiency is obtained with the addition of 1.5 mol% KPF6 salts (labeled as 3D/2D-KPF6), showing a higher Voc of 1.178 V, a Jsc of 24.03 mA•cm -2 , a FF of 0.825 and a PCE of 23.35% under RS, and a Voc of 1.175V, a Jsc of 24.06 mA•cm -2 , a fill factor (FF) of 0.818 and a PCE of 23.13% under FS. The average PCE of 23.24% is very close to the PCE from SPO of 23.2%, much higher than the control device (21.9%) (fig. S14A). It is not surprising to see when further adding of KPF6 decreases the PCE although having no hysteresis, as too much KPF6 will affect the nucleation behavior and lead to poorer film morphology (fig. S12C). The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra show an integrated Jsc of 23.70 mA•cm -2 and 23.78 mA•cm -2 for devices with and without KPF6, respectively (fig. S14B), which match well with the measured Jsc. In addition, the PSCs in the size of 1.0 cm 2 also exhibit significant improvements of PCEs, increasing from 21.92% (RS) and 19.31% (FS) to 22.53% (RS) and 22.27% (FS) with the addition of KPF6 (Fig. 2C, table S2). The distribution of J-V parameters for both small area and 1.0 cm 2 sized cells processed with or without KPF6 additives are shown in fig. S15. Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) and UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy (fig. S16) characterizations reveal the lifted CB minimum from -4.14 eV for 3D perovskite to -4.10 eV for 3D/2D perovskite, and further to -3.94 eV for 3D/2D-KPF6 perovskite, which contributes to the enhanced Voc of the modified devices.</p>
        <p>We further used the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements to characterize the trap density of these different films (30)(31)(32). The calculated defect density decreases from 6.17×10 15 cm -3 to 4.97×10 15 cm -3 , indicating the reduced defects of the perovskite film with the addition of KPF6 (Fig. 2D). The time-resolved confocal PL microscopy measurement was also performed to characterize the charge carrier properties of these perovskite films in micro-size (10 μm × 10 μm) (Fig. 2E to F). The blue region with a short PL lifetime for the pristine 3D/2D perovskite transits to a green region with a much longer PL lifetime after the addition of KPF6. It indicates a reduced trap-induced or non-radiative recombination by the defect passivation due to the addition of KPF6, thus resulting in a small Voc loss of ~0.37 eV (fig. S17). This passivation strategy would be beneficial to stability. Fig. 3A shows the thermal stability of widely researched CsFAMA triple-cationbased perovskite ((Cs0.05(FA0.85MA0.15)0.95)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3) and our MA-free perovskite (FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3) based solar cells measured at 85 ℃ in ambient air (15 ± 5% relative humidity). The efficiency of CsFAMA devices quickly decreases to 2.9 ± 3.1% within 360 hours. Obvious holes are observed from the cross-sectional SEM image due to the degradation of the CsFAMA device after aging at 85 ℃ (fig. S18). Although the MAfree 3D/2D devices exhibit a significant improvement and remain the black appearance, the devices still show a salient decrease after aging at 85 ℃ for 500 hours, remaining less than 50% of the initial efficiency. However, this degradation can be significantly suppressed with the addition of KPF6. The 3D/2D-KPF6 devices exhibit ~80% of the initial efficiency after aging at 85 ℃ for 500 hours. The J-V curves of different devices under the thermal stability measurements are plotted in fig. S19. It can be found that there is a negligible change of FF in the device processed with KPF6, indicating the undamaged interfaces of devices. This significant improvement in stability can be ascribed to the PF6 -induced complex in perovskite films. The complex stays on the surface, passivating the grain boundaries, as seen from the SEM images (fig. S12C). In addition, to unravel the distribution of PF6 -complex across the perovskite layer, we conducted time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) for 1.5 mol% KPF6 contained FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3-xClx perovskite film (Fig. 3B). A block-by-block distribution of the agglomerated PF6 -ions is shown in the three-dimensional visualization images. The corresponding depth profiles of TOF-SIMS and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) also show detected signals of K and F elements throughout the perovskite films (fig. S20 A-C). In addition, FTIR spectra show the N-H and P-F corresponding peaks shift to lower wavenumbers with the increasing amount of KPF6 additives, revealing the presence of the hydrogen bonding between perovskite and PF6 -(fig. S20 D-F). Thus, it would greatly affect both the perovskite grain boundary and interfacial properties of devices, contributing to better performance by passivating the surface defects.</p>
        <p>The corresponding cross-sectional SEM images of the thermal aged devices with or without KPF6 additives are shown in Fig. 3C to D. It is found that there is no obvious change of the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface with the KPF6 additive, while the The inset shows the schematic diagram of a 6 sub-cells series-connected module.

        <p>interface becomes intersected if without the KPF6 additive. We further employed TOF-SIMS characterization to probe the thermal aged devices and fresh devices (Fig. 3E to F, fig. S21). In the device without KPF6, Cs, Pb and I ions are shifted toward the spiro-OMeTAD layer. The Co ions that are a dopant in spiro-OMeTAD diffuse into the perovskite layer after thermal aging (Fig. 3E), matching well with the above SEM finding. With KPF6, the diffusion of ions is significantly suppressed (Fig. 3F).</p>
        <p>We also measured the light illumination stability of the devices. The solar cells were continuously measured for 5 times under one sun AM 1.5G. A rapid degradation of Voc and FF for the 1.0 cm 2 3D/2D perovskite solar cell is observed, while the KPF6 modified device exhibits negligible degradation (fig. S22). The long-term light illumination stability was also characterized as shown in fig. S23A. The champion device with KPF6 additives exhibits a better photo-stability than the pristine device, remaining 82% of its initial efficiency after 500 hours under continuous AM 1.5G solar illumination without a UV-filter, at an open-circuit condition that is said harsher than the operation condition (33). A more stable statistic PCE evolution of the devices with KPF6 additive compared with the pristine devices is seen in fig. S23B. Therefore, the KPF6 additive plays an important role in improving the stability of perovskite devices as well.</p>
        <p>As the dense perovskite films can be easily prepared by spin-coating of the developed ink at a relatively low speed, similarly a moderate dry-air gas can also promote nucleation (fig. S24A). Thus, a gas-assist slot-die printing technology towards the continuous deposition of large-area perovskite films is developed here, as demonstrated in Fig. 4A. With a low pressure of ~0.3 MPa dry air blowing, the printed wet perovskite film quickly changes to a brown color with a mirror-like surface, as shown in Movie S1. The inset in Fig. 4A presents the photograph of the printed large-area 20 cm × 20 cm perovskite film. A pinhole-free high-quality perovskite layer with clear grain boundaries is shown in the SEM image (fig. S24B).</p>
        <p>The 5 cm × 5 cm PSMs are then fabricated, and the J-V curves are shown in Fig. 4B.</p>
        <p>The inset shows the schematic diagram of a 6 sub-cell series-connected 5 cm × 5 cm module, and fig. S25 shows its photo. The slot-die printed PSM shows comparable performance to the spin-coating counterpart (Fig. 4B) with efficiencies over 20.4% (table S1). Certified efficiencies of 19.3% and 18.9% with a mask area of 17.1 cm 2 are achieved respectively for the slot-die printed and spin-coated PSMs (fig. S26-27). The hysteresis-suppression effect of KPF6 is also proven in large solar modules, exhibiting much stable efficiency (fig. S28A to B). We also achieved a champion FF of 0.806 for a 4 cm × 4 cm solar module (mask area = 10.0 cm 2 ) (fig. S28C), which is the highest record among the reported perovskite solar modules. Furthermore, it also shows excellent performance under weak light illumination and continuous multiple testing (fig. S28D). It indicates the super uniformity of large-area perovskite films achieved from this lead-halide templated crystallization strategy, contributes to highperformance solar modules.</p>
        <p>We further scaled up the perovskite films to print a 10 cm × 10 cm solar module with a series connection of 14 subcells, and demonstrated a hysteresis-free solar module with high efficiency of 19.54% under RS and 19.22% under FS with a mask area of 65.0 cm 2 (Fig. 4C). The module efficiencies from different upscaling methods with different active areas during the past years are summarized in Fig. 4D. The anti-solvent-free modulated high-quality perovskite films in this work exhibit the highest efficiencies among all the reported works, indicating the high processability for achieving largearea high-quality perovskite films.</p>
