        <p>This research is focused to fundamentally understand the benefits of using Agave Americana C. plant as potential reinforcement in polymeric composites. The fibers were extracted from the external part of the bark of the plant, which grows worldwide in pastures, grasslands, open woodlands, coastal and riparian zones. In order to use the natural fiber as reinforcement it is paramount important to probe their chemical composition, microstructural behavior and mechanical properties. Hence, firstly the extracted fibers were chemically treated with NaOH, stearic acid, benzoyl peroxide and potassium permanganate. The chemical composition in terms of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and other waxy substances were determined using a standard TAPPI method. FT-IR technique was used to understand the character of molecular bonds, crystallinity and their correlations with various bonds in fiber structure. The thermal stability was investigated through thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetric analysis, and the mechanical characterization was performed by applying standard tensile test. The surface morphology of fibers was examined through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and finally reliability scrutiny of all the analysis was carried out. The results of chemical modification techniques applied on the surfaces of natural fibers allows to produce superior fibers used to form the novel composite materials for light-weight application.This research is focused to fundamentally understand the benefits of using Agave Americana C. plant as potential reinforcement in polymeric composites.

        <p>Owing to the customers' demands for more energy efficient, lighter in weight, biodegradable, renewable and carbon sequestering materials, the industry is focusing their attention towards using more ecological and environmentally friendly materials [1]. Adding to these demands, the rapid depletion of fossil fuels and new government policies, which require the use of more materials produced from non-renewable sources, make the green materials attractive particularly in the manufacturing of novel composite materials [2,3]. In this context, the natural fibers used as reinforcements in polymer-based composites have been found to be very attractive and being used drastically used over the past few decades by several industrial sectors in manufacturing of their commercial products [4]. Natural fibers have attractive features like good thermo-mechanical properties, high electrical resistance, good acoustic insulating behavior and higher fracture resistance properties make them suitable materials to be used in production of many industrial items that include wind turbine blade, window and door frames, electrical and electronic industries, railway sleepers, automotive components, furniture, etc. [5][6][7]. Several researchers have investigated on different types of natural fibers like coir, hemp, banana, borassus, sisal, jute, tamarind, flax, kapok, kenaf, etc., as possible reinforcements in polymer composites. Although natural fibers possess certain advantages as mentioned above, they suffer some drawbacks while using in polymer matrix composites such as hydrophilic nature, high moisture sorption, poor resistance to high temperatures, variability in fiber properties and weak bonding with hydrophobic polymeric matrices [4,8,9]. Thus in order to overcome these problems and to improve the compatibility between natural fibers and polymer matrices certain surface modification processes like physical (surface fibrillation through mechanical beating, laser treatment, ozone treatment and plasma treatment) and chemical (alkali treatment, saline treatment, acetylation, benzoylation, potassium permanganate treatment, stearic acid treatment and polymer coatings) treatment methods are being used [2,10].Owing to the customers' demands for more energy efficient, lighter in weight, biodegradable, renewable and carbon sequestering materials, the industry is focusing their attention towards using more ecological and environmentally friendly materials [1].

        <p>Chemical treatment methods are generally based on the utilization of reagent functional groups which are capable of reacting superiorly with natural fiber structures as well as effectively remove non-cellulosic materials from the fibers. Thus, this surface modification technique helps the fibers to have better bonding with polymeric matrices [11,12]. The alkali treatment is one of the most effective chemical treatment technique employed to remove hemicellulose and other impurities from fibers thereby leading to enhanced cellulose content which in turn results in improved mechanical properties [13]. The adhesion properties between hydrophilic fiber and hydrophobic matrix can be enhanced by peroxide treatment. Short sisal fibers were chemically treated with diluted 6% benzoyl peroxide and 4% dicumyl peroxide and resulted in improved tensile strength properties [14]. Potassium permanganate (KMnO4) treatment results in the reaction of permanganate ions with hydroxyl groups and initiates graft copolymerization with the formation of cellulose-manganate. Further, this treatment improves interfacial adhesion characteristics between fibers and matrix [15]. Another important method used for fiber surface modification is stearic acid treatment where the carboxyl groups of stearic acid reacts with hydroxyl groups in the fibers through esterification reaction and results in removal of non-crystalline materials like waxes; oils etc., as well as improves water resistance properties [11,16]. The modification techniques are going to affect the fiber mechanical properties, their thermal behavior, crystalline structure, and morphology, this has been studied and reported by many researchers in their work.Chemical treatment methods are generally based on the utilization of reagent functional groups which are capable of reacting superiorly with natural fiber structures as well as effectively remove non-cellulosic materials from the fibers.

        <p>All lignocellulosic fibers are renowned by their crystalline and amorphous structure. The strong hydrophilic hydroxyl groups and hemicellulose, lignin, pectin and other waxy substances present in this crystallite and amorphous regions are going to lower the compatibility with the hydrophobic matrix [11. 12, 27]. Furthermore, cellulose constituent plays a very important role in providing the necessary strength and stiffness to natural fibers and hemicellulose is accountable for moisture absorption and thermal degradation in the fibers. The fiber structural behaviour and its morphological property are authorized by its lignin content [28]. The chemical composition and density of raw and different chemically treated AAFs was determined and capitulated in Table 1. From the results it is clear that the raw fibers have high percentage of hemicellulose and lignin content, while have lower cellulose content. Upon various chemical modification techniques used, the hemicellulose and lignin content decreases while the cellulose content has increased considerably in all the treated fibers showing partial hydroxylation and depolymerization in hemicellulose and lignin content respectively [19]. The wax and moisture content of all the treated AAFs show ascending values compared to raw fibers which implies that treated fibers will provide improved adhesion and closed crystalline packing between fiber and matrix. The decreased ash contents in chemically treated AAFs directly impacts on its mechanical behavior [29]. It is observed that the density of AAFs increased upon chemical treatments and can be attributed due to densification of fiber cell walls and filling up of pores by grafted molecules [30].All lignocellulosic fibers are renowned by their crystalline and amorphous structure.

        <p>The existence of several functional groups in raw and chemically treated AAFs is detected using FTIR analysis. FTIR spectra of raw, NaOH, stearic acid (SA), benzoyl peroxide (BP) and potassium permanganate (PP) treated AAFs are described in Fig. 1. The band peaks have been assessed from 4000 to 500 cm À 1 . The typical wide peak between 3427 and 3100 cm À 1 in all treated and raw AAFs is linked to OH stretching of α-cellulose and can be attributed to hydrogen bonded cellulose structure while, the peak 2917 cm À 1 is ascribed to C-H stretching vibration group of cellulose [31]. The absorption band peak 2357 cm À 1 is evidenced only in raw AAF and barely visible in modified AAFs exemplifies the presence of wax and other impurities in raw fibers and is related to C � C stretching of wax. The decreasing peaks 1602 cm À 1 and 1552 cm À 1 is seen in all treated and raw fibers and corresponds to C--O stretching vibration of the amide group in hemicellulose and lignin respectively. The chemical treatments usually lessen the hydrogen bonds from cellulose hydroxyl group along with the elimination of carboxyl group in fibers and this is noticeable around the peak 1022 cm À 1 and is correlated with C-OH stretching of lignin [2,5]. The peaks and their allocations are shown in Table 2.The existence of several functional groups in raw and chemically treated AAFs is detected using FTIR analysis.

        <p>TGA curves of raw and treated AAFs are depicted in Fig. 2. From the curves, it is evident that thermal degradation occurred in 3 stages. The initial weight loss was seen at below 100 � C and the weight loss was around 5-8%. The 1st stage of thermal degradation process was experienced between 50 � C and 185 � C and could be due to the eradication of moisture content and some waxy materials from the fibers and the weight loss was around 15% in this temperature range. Next, the 2nd degradation stage progressed at the temperature ranging 220 � C and 340 � C and may be due to degradation of hemicellulose and α-cellulose [31][32][33]. The corresponding weight loss in this temperature ranges for raw and NaOH treated fiber was around 50% and for SA, BP and PP treated fibers was around 55-60%. The last degradation stage was seen at temperature range 370 � C and 490 � C and corresponded to the degradation of lignin and other non-cellulosic materials present in the fibers [34].

        <p>The average of five samples were chosen from raw and various treatments for tensile test, respectively. From Table 3, it is quantified that the average tensile strength and elongation at break of chemically treated AAFs are higher than those of raw fibers and this can be credited to the fibers tendency towards becoming closely packed due to the removal of hemicellulose by various chemical treatments. The young's modulus is found to be higher in raw fibers, while there is not much significant difference among the chemically treated fibers. The tensile values of AAFs exhibit good properties and tend to be suitable reinforcements in polymer matrices [35,36].The average of five samples were chosen from raw and various treatments for tensile test, respectively.

        <p>The peaks used for FT-IR analysis and possible allocations of raw, NaOH, SA, BP and PP treated AAFs. materials and impurities from the surface of the fiber. From Fig. 4(b) to (e), it can be seen that several chemical treatments caused an increase in the number of pores in the surface of the fiber. It also showed a very clean surface and the absence of impurities was very obvious. In addition, the treatment also damaged the surface of the fiber; these changes have benefits in the manufacture of composite materials when the fibers are used as reinforcement materials. The rougher surface improves the mechanical interlocking adhesion between the fibers and the matrix. In fact, after treatment with PP, it is observed that waxes, oils and other impurities are completely removed without damaging the surface of the fiber (Fig. 4 (e)). It is concluded that the effect of chemical treatments that can significantly eliminate impurities due to the reduction of hydrophilicity.The peaks used for FT-IR analysis and possible allocations of raw, NaOH, SA, BP and PP treated AAFs. materials and impurities from the surface of the fiber.

        <p>The contact angle of raw and chemically treated AAFs are tabulated in Table 4. There is a marginal increase in the contact angles of the all chemically treated AAFs compared to raw AAF. This behavior is due to the removal of non-polar materials namely hemicellulose, wax, lignin etc. from the surface of treated fibers. And nature of reduction in the contact angle of untreated AAF is due to the presence of hydrophobic constituents. This is evident that the treated fiber surface is rougher and this higher wettability of fiber cause better bonding with matrix material [37].The contact angle of raw and chemically treated AAFs are tabulated in Table 4.

        <p>� The chemical analysis results indicate that the application of different chemical treatments on the fibers can bring significant reduction in the amorphous contents like hemicellulose, lignin and other impurities and make them less resistant to water molecules. � FT-IR analysis confirms that the removal of amorphous contents is produced during the chemical treatments. � TGA and DSC expose better thermal behaviour in the AAFs after surface modification. � The tensile test reveals major improved on the tensile strength and elongation at break in all the modified AAFs at the expenses of lower young's modulus which is associated to high variation in fiber dimensions after the treatment. � SEM measurements provided significant details of hydrophilic nature of raw AAFs inked to various chemical treatments. � The contact angle analysis shows the enhancement of surface roughness by applying chemically treatment, therefore the treated fibers have a superior wettability.� The chemical analysis results indicate that the application of different chemical treatments on the fibers can bring significant reduction in the amorphous contents like hemicellulose, lignin and other impurities and make them less resistant to water molecules. � FT-IR analysis confirms that the removal of amorphous contents is produced during the chemical treatments. � TGA and DSC expose better thermal behaviour in the AAFs after surface modification. � The tensile test reveals major improved on the tensile strength and elongation at break in all the modified AAFs at the expenses of lower young's modulus which is associated to high variation in fiber dimensions after the treatment. � SEM measurements provided significant details of hydrophilic nature of raw AAFs inked to various chemical treatments. � The contact angle analysis shows the enhancement of surface roughness by applying chemically treatment, therefore the treated fibers have a superior wettability.</p>
