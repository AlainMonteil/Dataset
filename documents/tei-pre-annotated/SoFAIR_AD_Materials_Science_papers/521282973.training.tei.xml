        <p>The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the all-PSCs has risen up to 16% very recently, driven by the rapid development of both new efficient P D s and polymerized small-molecule acceptors (PSMAs). [9][10][11][12][13][14] However, only a few all-PSCs with PCEs of over 13% have been reported, which is still much lower than those of the state-of-art SMA-based ones. More importantly, their mechanical properties are still far from the requirements on wearable devices (i.e., crack onset strain (COS) of at least 20-30% required).The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the all-PSCs has risen up to 16% very recently, driven by the rapid development of both new efficient P D s and polymerized small-molecule acceptors (PSMAs).

        <p>The major hurdles that hamper the performance of all-PSCs based on PSMAs are the strongly phase-separated blend morphologies, driven by de-mixing of high molecular weight P D s and PSMAs, resulting in un-optimized charge generation and transport. [15,16] These un-optimal morphologies typically include numerous defect sites (i.e., sharp domain-domain interfaces and large polymer aggregates) in the blend film, limiting the mechanical robustness and stretchability with low COS. [17][18][19] In addition, the phase separation of polymer blends is affected by the aggregation and crystalline behaviors of the P D s and P A s. In particular, the PSMAs containing highly crystalline, rigid SMA unit typically possess very strong crystalline and aggregation properties, causing strongly phase-separated High efficiency and mechanical robustness are both crucial for the practical applications of all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) in stretchable and wearable electronics. In this regard, a series of new polymer acceptors (P A s) is reported by incorporating a flexible conjugation-break spacer (FCBS) to achieve highly efficient and mechanically robust all-PSCs. Incorporation of FCBS affords the effective modulation of the crystallinity and pre-aggregation of the P A s, and achieves the optimal blend morphology with polymer donor (P D ), increasing both the photovoltaic and mechanical properties of all-PSCs. In particular, an all-PSC based on PYTS-0.3 P A incorporated with 30% FCBS and PBDB-T P D demonstrates a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.68% and excellent mechanical stretchability with a crack onset strain (COS) of 21.64% and toughness of 3.86 MJ m -3 , which is significantly superior to those of devices with the P A without the FCBS (PYTS-0.0, PCE = 13.01%, and toughness = 2.70 MJ m -3 ). To date, this COS is the highest value reported for PSCs with PCEs of over 8% without any insulating additives. These results reveal that the introduction of FCBS into the conjugated backbone is a highly feasible strategy to simultaneously improve the PCE and stretchability of PSCs.The major hurdles that hamper the performance of all-PSCs based on PSMAs are the strongly phase-separated blend morphologies, driven by de-mixing of high molecular weight P D s and PSMAs, resulting in un-optimized charge generation and transport.

        <p>All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), consisting of a binary blend of a polymer donor (P D ) and a polymer acceptor (P A ), possess important advantages including enhanced morphological stability, improved mechanical flexibility, and better compatibility with large-area roll-to-roll production over PSCs based structure with excessive domain purity, thereby lowering both short-circuit current density (J sc ) and fill factor (FF) of all-PSCs. [17,20] Consequently, a variety of strategies including modification of the P A structure and optimization of processing conditions have attempted to improve the blend morphology. [21][22][23][24][25][26] Among these, ternary copolymerization provides effective means to modulate the solubility, optical property, energy level and aggregation behaviors of the P A s, and, thus, the blend morphology with the P D s. [27][28][29][30][31][32] For instance, Li et al. developed random ternary PSMAs to improve the solubility, molecular crystallinity, and morphology of the blends. [33] Their all-PSCs based on a P A containing 30% ester-substituted thiophene as a third component exhibited better PCE and photostability as compared with those based on their parent P A . However, a ternary copolymerization strategy has been rarely used to tune the aggregation behavior and molecular rigidity of PSMAs and the blend miscibility with P D . This is particularly important to increase the mechanical robustness of the active layer by optimizing the domain sizes/purities and removing the morphological defects. [2,34,35] The polymer:polymer blend films are supposed to have better mechanical properties than the polymer:SMAs-based ones. However, there are only very few studies about mechanical properties of all-PSCs based on PSMAs, and most of these devices reported exhibit low mechanical robustness (i.e., COS of less than 15%). [17,18] The low mechanical property is mainly due to their rigid and large fused-rings in such PSMA backbone, which causes excessive aggregation behaviors and unoptimal blend morphologies. [2,36] On the other hand, the planar and rigid fused-rings of the PSMAs are essential for achieving high light absorption, charge transport, and thereby high J sc and PCE. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop an effective method that achieves a balance between these two important influences in the PSMAs to combine mechanical robustness with high photovoltaic (PV) performance.All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), consisting of a binary blend of a polymer donor (P D ) and a polymer acceptor (P A ), possess important advantages including enhanced morphological stability, improved mechanical flexibility, and better compatibility with large-area roll-to-roll production over PSCs based structure with excessive domain purity, thereby lowering both short-circuit current density (J sc ) and fill factor (FF) of all-PSCs.

        <p>Recently, we reported two non-conjugated P A s, PF1-TS4 and PFY-2TS namely, with SMA (IDIC16 for the former and YBO-Br for the latter) linked by thioalkyl chains, which have comparable absorption coefficient and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level as compared with IDIC16 and Y5. [37,38] The introduction of the "soft" flexible conjugation-break spacers (FCBS) of thioalkyl chains brings promising PV performance and morphological stability for either PF1-TS4 or PFY-2TS-based PSCs. Nevertheless, their mechanical properties are not explored. On the other hand, P D s containing FCBS have been developed very recently for SMA-based-PSCs.

        <p>Here, we developed a new and facile synthetic strategy for regulating the molecular rigidity and aggregation behavior of P A through the introduction of FCBS, and achieved all-PSCs with high mechanical properties and PV performance at the same time. A series of Y5-based terpolymer acceptors consisting of 1,8-bis((5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)thio)octane (TS8) as FCBS and thiophene were synthesized by random copolymerization. The incorporation of FCBS (i.e., non-conjugated thioalkyl chain) is found to significantly improve the solubility and molecular flexibility of P A s. Interestingly, this leads to the well-controlled temperature-dependent aggregation behavior, resulting in enhanced crystallinity and electron mobility of P A in thin films. As a result, all-PSCs based on PYTS-0.3 P A incorporated with 30% of FCBS achieved a high PCE of 14.68%, which significantly outperform that of the all-PSC with PYTS-0.0 without FCBS (PCE = 13.01%) due to the enhanced exciton dissociation and suppressed monomolecular/trap-assisted recombination. Importantly, the mechanical robustness of PBDB-T:PYTS-0.3 blend is also significantly enhanced (COS = 21.64% and toughness = 3.86 MJ m -3 ) compared to those of the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.0 blend (COS = 18.84% and toughness = 2.70 MJ m -3 ), which represents one of the highest values among all-PSCs based on PSMAs so far.

        <p>(PBDB-T) is employed as P D in this study to construct complementary light absorption with a series of P A . [42] FCBS was introduced into the backbone of PYTS-0.0 as a third component to systematically control the aggregation and crystalline properties of the P A s by alleviating their backbone rigidities (in pink in Figure 1b). A long 1,8-bis((5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl) thio)octane (TS8) segment was selected to provide sufficient backbone flexibility for the resulting P A s. The P A s were synthesized via Stille coupling polymerization by varying the molar ratios of thiophene (T) and TS8 donor units while fixing the content of Y5-OD-2Br (Scheme S1, Supporting Information). The resulting terpolymer acceptors were named PYTS-x, where x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0, respectively, denoting the mole fractions of the TS8 unit relative to the total donating moieties (T + TS8). The number-average molecular weights (M n s) of PYTS-x are controlled to be similar among each other between 9-17 kg mol -1 as determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) (Table 1). [43] The decomposition temperature (T d , 5% mass loss) of the terpolymer acceptors was found as high as 340-344 °C in thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Figure S1a, Supporting Information), which indicates that the FCBS has little influence on the thermal properties of these terpolymers. The solubilities of the polymers were measured, which are summarized in Figure S2 and Table S1, Supporting Information. As anticipated, the solubility of the P A s clearly increased with increasing FCBS content in the polymer backbones. For example, the solubility of the P A s in hot chlorobenzene (CB) solution (at 80°C) increased in the order of 7.2, 17.6, and 26.6 mg mL -1 for the PYTS-0.0, PYTS-0.3, and PYTS-1.0, respectively (Table S1, Supporting Information).(PBDB-T) is employed as P D in this study to construct complementary light absorption with a series of P A .

        <p>The optical and electrochemical properties of the polymers are summarized in Figure 1d,e, Figure S1 (Supporting Information), and Table 1, respectively. Figure 1c shows the alignment of energy levels for the active materials, indicating that all of the P A s showed well-aligned highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and LUMO levels with that of P D for all-PSC operation. The P A s showed blueshifts for both shoulderpeak absorption in the 600-650 regime (peak 1) and maximum absorption wavelength (λ max ) in the 700-800 nm regime (peak 2) in the normalized UV-vis absorption at 80 °C in CB solution as the content of FCBS in the P A increased (Figure 1d). This might arise from their molecular conformation changes via rotation of sp 3 hybridized C-C single bonds within FCBS. [44,45] In PYTS-0.0, the fully conjugated and rigid backbone gives neither the Y5 nor the thiophene block enough freedom to twist, while the introduction of FCBS provides increased chain flexibility on P A segments to twist. This results in above-mentioned blueshifted absorption spectra of P A s with FCBS in solution compared to those of PYTS-0.0. The absorption coefficient of the P A s in solution decreased with increasing FCBS content (Table S1, Supporting Information). On the other hand, all P A s showed similar λ max and optical bandgap in film states, Adv.

        <p>To investigate the P A aggregation property depending on the FCBS unit content, the temperature-dependent UV-vis absorption spectra in CB solution were measured (Figure S3, Supporting Information). [28,[47][48][49][50] PYTS-0.0, PYTS-0.1, and PYTS-0.3 exhibited blueshifted absorption maxima and gradually decreased absorption intensity as temperature increased, which indicates that the P A s tend to being aggregated at room temperature, but being disaggregated at high temperatures. [51] However, PYTS-0.0 has the lowest solubility and merely soluble even in hot CB solution (Figure S2 and Table S1, Supporting Information). Thus, PYTS-0.0 polymers quickly form a gel (aggregation even at 80 °C) even before the start of the spin-coating for film preparation, which is attributed to their strong intermolecular π-π interactions. [46,52] The solubilities of P A s were significantly improved with increasing FCBS content. For example, PYTS-1.0 showed increased absorption intensity with large blueshifts of the absorption wavelengths (33 nm) when the temperature increased from 20 to 80 °C (Figure S3e, Supporting Information). The broad absorption spectrum of this polymer at 20 °C indicates that it has multi-molecular conformations and more twisted structures rendered by the flexible spacers, and thus less aggregation in solution. Therefore, we assumed that PYTS-1.0 cannot form aggregated structures during the film forming process, leading to films with less ordered structures and poor electron mobility (will be discussed later). In comparison, the FCBS in PYTS-0.1 and PYTS-0.3 delivered an optimal tradeoff between the solubility and the aggregation in the solution, allowing the formation of well-ordered aggregate structures of the polymers in the films.To investigate the P A aggregation property depending on the FCBS unit content, the temperature-dependent UV-vis absorption spectra in CB solution were measured (Figure S3, Supporting Information).

        <p>To investigate the effects of the FCBS units on the P A crystallinity and charge-transport properties, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and space charge limited current (SCLC) electron mobility (μ e s) measurements were performed (Figure 1e, Figures S4 andS5: Supporting Information). In the GIWAXS profiles, all the polymers showed the face-on preferential packing structures with prominent (100) peaks in the in-plane (IP) direction and (010) peaks in the outof-plane (OOP) direction, which is beneficial for facilitating vertical charge transport in the thin film (Figures S4 andS5, Supporting Information). Interestingly, the P A s with appropriate FCBS contents show optimal crystallinity and μ e s compared with the P A without the FCBS unit (Table 1). For details, the coherence lengths (L c s) of the (010) peaks in the OOP direction estimated from the GIWAXS linecuts increased from 2.09 nm for PYTS-0.0 to 2.53 nm for PYTS-0.3. Accordingly, the SCLC μ e values increased from 9.4 × 10 -5 cm 2 V -1 s -1 for PYTS-0.0 to 4.8 × 10 -4 cm 2 V -1 s -1 for PYTS-0.3. However, excessive interposition of the FCBS units reduced the crystallinity and μ e s of the P A . For instance, the L c(010) OOP value decreased to 2.18 nm, and the corresponding μ e decreased to 4.7 × 10 -6 cm 2 V -1 s -1 for PYTS-1.0. These results demonstrate that the appropriate incorporation of the FCBS units (0.1 and 0.3 mole fractions) into the P A s can noticeably enhance the crystallinity and charge-transport abilities in thin films, while effectively alleviating their backbone rigidities and aggregation in solutions. However, the introduction of a large amount of FCBS (over 0.5 mole fraction) not only impedes charge transport along polymer backbones but also suppresses the molecular aggregation in the film, thus significantly decreasing the electron mobility of the resulting blends. [53,54] To characterize the PV properties of the P A s, all-PSCs with a normal type device architecture were fabricated. The detailed device configurations and the fabrication procedures are described in the Supporting Information. Figure 2a shows the current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics of the all-PSCs under optimized conditions, and the summarized PV parameters are shown in Table 2. The all-PSC device based on the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.0 blend showed a PCE of 13.01% with an opencircuit voltage (V oc ) of 0.92 V and a J sc of 22.38 mA cm -2 , which is comparable to the reported values. [55] Notably, the all-PSCs with PBDB-T:PYTS-0.3 blend showed a remarkably high PCE of 14.68% with a high J sc of 22.91 mA cm -2 , and FF of 0.70. However, the blends with high content of the FCBS units exhibited significantly low performances (with a PCE of 1.71% for the PBDB-T:PYTS-1.0-based device). The origin of the different performances of the blends came from their variations in J sc and FF values. This demonstrates that the FCBS has a strong influence on the PV performance of all-PSCs. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) results are shown in Figure 2b. The calculated J sc values from the EQE spectra are presented in Table 2, which are well-matched with the device J sc s within a deviation of ± 4%. The EQE spectra of the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.1 and PBDB-T:PYTS-0.3 blends showed higher responses in both P D (550-700 nm) and P A absorption ranges (750-900 nm) than those of PBDB-T:PYTS-0.0, suggesting that the blend with P A s having proper FCBS units have more efficient charge generations from both P D and P A absorption ranges.To investigate the effects of the FCBS units on the P A crystallinity and charge-transport properties, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and space charge limited current (SCLC) electron mobility (μ e s) measurements were performed (Figure 1e, Figures S4 andS5: Supporting Information). In the GIWAXS profiles, all the polymers showed the face-on preferential packing structures with prominent (100) peaks in the in-plane (IP) direction and (010) peaks in the outof-plane (OOP) direction, which is beneficial for facilitating vertical charge transport in the thin film (Figures S4 andS5, Supporting Information). Interestingly, the P A s with appropriate FCBS contents show optimal crystallinity and μ e s compared with the P A without the FCBS unit (Table 1). For details, the coherence lengths (L c s) of the (010) peaks in the OOP direction estimated from the GIWAXS linecuts increased from 2.09 nm for PYTS-0.0 to 2.53 nm for PYTS-0.3. Accordingly, the SCLC μ e values increased from 9.4 × 10 -5 cm 2 V -1 s -1 for PYTS-0.0 to 4.8 × 10 -4 cm 2 V -1 s -1 for PYTS-0.3. However, excessive interposition of the FCBS units reduced the crystallinity and μ e s of the P A . For instance, the L c(010) OOP value decreased to 2.18 nm, and the corresponding μ e decreased to 4.7 × 10 -6 cm 2 V -1 s -1 for PYTS-1.0. These results demonstrate that the appropriate incorporation of the FCBS units (0.1 and 0.3 mole fractions) into the P A s can noticeably enhance the crystallinity and charge-transport abilities in thin films, while effectively alleviating their backbone rigidities and aggregation in solutions. However, the introduction of a large amount of FCBS (over 0.5 mole fraction) not only impedes charge transport along polymer backbones but also suppresses the molecular aggregation in the film, thus significantly decreasing the electron mobility of the resulting blends. [53,54] To characterize the PV properties of the P A s, all-PSCs with a normal type device architecture were fabricated. The detailed device configurations and the fabrication procedures are described in the Supporting Information. Figure 2a shows the current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics of the all-PSCs under optimized conditions, and the summarized PV parameters are shown in Table 2. The all-PSC device based on the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.0 blend showed a PCE of 13.01% with an opencircuit voltage (V oc ) of 0.92 V and a J sc of 22.38 mA cm -2 , which is comparable to the reported values. [55] Notably, the all-PSCs with PBDB-T:PYTS-0.3 blend showed a remarkably high PCE of 14.68% with a high J sc of 22.91 mA cm -2 , and FF of 0.70. However, the blends with high content of the FCBS units exhibited significantly low performances (with a PCE of 1.71% for the PBDB-T:PYTS-1.0-based device). The origin of the different performances of the blends came from their variations in J sc and FF values. This demonstrates that the FCBS has a strong influence on the PV performance of all-PSCs. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) results are shown in Figure 2b. The calculated J sc values from the EQE spectra are presented in Table 2, which are well-matched with the device J sc s within a deviation of ± 4%. The EQE spectra of the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.1 and PBDB-T:PYTS-0.3 blends showed higher responses in both P D (550-700 nm) and P A absorption ranges (750-900 nm) than those of PBDB-T:PYTS-0.0, suggesting that the blend with P A s having proper FCBS units have more efficient charge generations from both P D and P A absorption ranges.</p>
        <p>To elucidate the origins of different all-PSC performances, their charge-generation, charge-transport, and charge-recombination properties were investigated. First, the photocurrent density (J ph ) under effective voltage (V eff ) were measured to analyze the charge generation property of the blends. The exciton dissociation probability (P(E,T)) values were calculated by the J sc values over the saturation current densities (J sat , at V eff = 3 V). [56] The P(E,T) values increased from 86.8% for the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.0 blend to 91.1% for the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.3 blend, and decreased to 52.8% for the PBDB-T:PYTS-1.0 blend (Figure 2c). This indicates that the interposition of proper mole fraction of the FCBS units in the P A s attained maximum charge generation properties within the PBDB-T:PYTS series. Also, the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.3 blend showed the highest photoluminescence (PL) quenching efficiency (Φ q ) among the blends, supporting the efficient charge separation ability of the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.3 blend (Figure S6, Supporting Information). For example, the Φ q values of PBDB-T:PYTS-0.0, PBDB-T:PYTS-0.3, and PBDB-T:PYTS-1.0 blends excited at 514 nm were 74.4%, 82.1%, and 41.7%, respectively.To elucidate the origins of different all-PSC performances, their charge-generation, charge-transport, and charge-recombination properties were investigated.

        <p>Next, SCLC mobilities for the blend films were measured to investigate charge-transport properties (Table S2, Supporting Information). The hole mobility (μ h ) values remained almost constant independent on the blends, whereas the μ e values showed a non-linear trend. For example, μ e values of the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.0, PBDB-T:PYTS-0.3, and PBDB-T:PYTS-1.0 were 5.8 × 10 -5 , 2.3 × 10 -4 , and 8.8 × 10 -7 cm 2 V -1 s -1 , respectively. As a result, the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.3 blend showed the most balanced μ h /μ e value (1.5) among all the blends including the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.0 blend (μ h /μ e = 6.7), and the PBDB-T:PYTS-1.0 (μ h /μ e = 420.5). Highly unbalanced μ h /μ e and very low μ e of the PBDB-T:PYTS-1.0 blend might be caused by the un-optimized blend morphology and the absence of the electron transport channel. This is also supported by significant difference of μ e values between the pristine PYTS-1.0 and the PBDB-T:PYTS-1.0 blend. In contrast, the high μ e value and the balanced μ h /μ e of the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.3 blend implies the formation of a wellconnected charge-transport pathway in the blend. These high and balanced charge mobilities result in suppressed charge recombinations, explaining the highest J sc and FF value in the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.3-based all-PSC.Next, SCLC mobilities for the blend films were measured to investigate charge-transport properties (Table S2, Supporting Information).

        <p>In series, the dependence of J sc and V oc on light intensity (P) was studied to analyze the charge recombination properties of the all-PSCs (Figure S7 (Supporting Information) and Figure 2d). There were no significant differences in the α values (slopes in the J sc vs P plots) across the blends, suggesting that the extent of bimolecular recombination was similar among all the blends (Figure S7, Supporting Information). [57] V oc is proportional to the natural logarithm of P (V oc = S × ln(P)), and the S value has a unit of kT q -1 (where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, and q refers to elementary charge), being close to the unity when monomolecular/ trap-assisted recombinations are not prevalent. [58] The S values exhibited noticeable differences among the blends (Figure 2d). Table 2. PV performances of the all-PSCs depending on the FCBS compositions in P A s.

        <p>For example, the S value decreased from 1.21 kT q -1 for PBDB-T:PYTS-0.0 to 1.03 kT q -1 for PBDB-T:PYTS-0.3. Then, it significantly increased to 1.54 kT q -1 for PBDB-T:PYTS-1.0 blend. This shows that incorporating small amount (less than 0.3 mole fraction) of FCBS units in the P A s suppressed monomolecular or trap-assisted recombination of the all-PSCs, whereas the excessive incorporation (larger than 0.5 mole fraction) rather provoked charge recombination. The combined results from the charge generation and recombination properties support the increased J sc and FF values in the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.1 and PBDB-T:PYTS-0.3 blends compared with those of the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.0 and PBDB-T:PYTS-1.0 blends.For example, the S value decreased from 1.21 kT q -1 for PBDB-T:PYTS-0.0 to 1.03 kT q -1 for PBDB-T:PYTS-0.3.

        <p>We analyzed the mechanical properties of the blends using a pseudo free-standing tensile test method. This testing method permits the measurement of the intrinsic tensile property of the thin-film by excluding the influences of the thick substrates. [59] The PBDB-T:P A blend thin-films were fabricated under the conditions used for the all-PSC fabrication, and the results from the tensile tests are displayed in Figure 3 and Table 3. In overall, as the FCBS content in the P A s increased, the elastic moduli (E) of the resulting blend films increased, suggesting that the FCBS units in the P A s increased the stiffness of the thin-films (Figure 3b). The PBDB-T:PYTS-0.3 blend showed the highest stretchability with its COS values of 21.64% among the blends, which is superior to that of the blend based on the PYTS-0.0 (COS = 18.84%). In addition, the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.3 blend had a higher toughness value of 3.86 MJ m -3 than that of the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.0 blend (2.70 MJ m -3 ). Further increasing the FCBS content to 0.5 and 1.0 mole fraction in the P A s resulted in increased stress values under the same strains, but they decreased the stretchability of the blend films. It is worthwhile to note that the PYTS-0.3-based all-PSCs attained a high COS value of 21.64% while gaining a high PCE of 14.68% simultaneously. In contrast, most of the PSCs reported so far showed a trade-off between the photovoltaic performance and mechanical ductility (Figure S8 and Table S3, Supporting information). [17,21,24,36,60,61] In the optical microscopy (OM) images of the tensile bars before testing, the blend films showed different morphologies depending on the P A s (Figure 3c, upper images). The PBDB-T:PYTS-0.0 blend showed the locally formed but large-sized defects in their film (left image), whereas the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.3 blend showed more uniform and smoother surfaces without the defects or agglomerates in the non-strain image (middle image). In comparison, the PBDB-T:PYTS-1.0 blend (right image) showed many aggregates through the film, but their sizes were smaller than those of the PBDB-T:PTYS-0.0 blend. In the films with 12% strain being applied, the three blends also showed very different morphologies (Figure 3cWe analyzed the mechanical properties of the blends using a pseudo free-standing tensile test method.

These cracks and defects accelerated the mechanical failures under further strain due to stress concentrations.

        <p>To further explore the stability of PV properties under cyclic bending, we fabricated flexible all-PSC devices based on PBDB-T:PYTS-0.0 and PBDB-T:PYTS-0.3 blends (Figure S9, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure S9b (Supporting Information), the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.3-based flexible all-PSCs exhibited an initial PCE of 11.04%, which is higher than that of the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.0-based flexible all-PSCs (PCE = 10.12%). In addition, we measured the PCE variations of the flexible devices under continuously bending cycles with a radius of 4 mm. The PBDB-T:PYTS-0.3-based all-PSCs exhibited a higher stability than the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.0-based devices. For example, the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.3-based all-PSCs maintained a 88% of the initial PCE after 350-times bending, while the PCE of the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.0-based devices decreased to the 80% of its initial PCE after the same bending cycles (Figure S9c, Supporting Information).To further explore the stability of PV properties under cyclic bending, we fabricated flexible all-PSC devices based on PBDB-T:PYTS-0.0 and PBDB-T:PYTS-0.3 blends (Figure S9, Supporting Information).

[63][64][65][66] Both the blends show good morphological stability and retained over 80% of the initial PCEs after 120 h of the thermal testing.

        <p>To elucidate the origins of the different photovoltaic and mechanical properties of the PBDB-T:P A blends, we examined the morphological properties of the blend films using the combined measurements of GIWAXS, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 4 and Figures S11-12: Supporting Information). The PBDB-T:P A blends showed the non-linear trends of the L c values from the GIWAXS measurements, being consistent with the crystalline properties of the pristine P A s. As shown in Figure 4a,b and Table 4, the L c values of the (100) peaks in the IP direction increased from 17.1 nm for the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.0 blend to 27.3 nm for the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.3 blend. Then, the L c value decreased back to 17.6 nm in the PBDB-T:PYTS-1.0 blend. The L c values of the (010) peaks in the OOP direction showed a similar, non-linear trend with the IP (100) peaks (Table 4). This result indicates that the proper interposition of the FCBS units in the P A increased the crystallinity of the P A s in the blends, while the excessive incorporation of FCBS decreased the crystallinity.To elucidate the origins of the different photovoltaic and mechanical properties of the PBDB-T:P A blends, we examined the morphological properties of the blend films using the combined measurements of GIWAXS, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 4 and Figures S11-12: Supporting Information).

        <p>In the AFM height images, the root-mean-square averaged surface roughness (R q ) of the blends increased with the FCBS content in the P A s (Figure 4c). The R q of the blend increased from 1.1 nm for the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.0 blend to 2.5 nm for the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.3 blend, and further to 4.3 nm for the PBDB-T:PYTS-1.0 blend. Also, the sizes of the domains in the AFM height and phase images became larger with increasing FCBS content, indicating that the incorporation of FCBS units in the P A s increased the degree of phase segregation between P D and P A (Figure 4c and Figure S12: Supporting Information). The TEM images show a similar trend to those from the AFM results, showing larger and more phase-separated domains in the blends with the P A s having higher FCBS content (Figure 4d).In the AFM height images, the root-mean-square averaged surface roughness (R q ) of the blends increased with the FCBS content in the P A s (Figure 4c).

        <p>From the combined results of the above morphological analyses, the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.0 blend showed less phase-separated domains compared with those of the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.5 and PBDB-T:PYTS-1.0 blends. However, the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.0 blend contained many defects and large aggregates as observed in the OM images. These were the results of the precipitation of the strongly formed PYTS-0.0 aggregates during the film formation of solution processing due to the highly rigid backbone and low solubility of PYTS-0.0 P A s (left illustration in Figure 5). In this case, the largely aggregated P A s in the films deteriorate charge generation and recombination properties of the all-PSCs, and provide crack propagation pathways by acting stress concentration regions when the mechanical stresses are applied. On the other hand, when the excessive amounts of the FCBS units (over 0.5 mole fraction) are incorporated in the P A s, the blend underwent severe phase-separation between P D and P A domains, in which much less-ordered P A structures were formed as indicated by their low crystallinity (right morphology in Figure 5). These disconnected domains with low crystalline structures can limit electron-hopping from domains to other domains, resulting in lower electron mobility and more severe charge recombination and, thus, limiting the J sc and FF of the all-PSCs. Also, the sharp and weak interfaces between the domains can provide crack propagation routes under tensile loadings, resulting in mechanical failures. We speculate that the weak crystalline structures of the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.5 and PBDB-T:PYTS-1.0 were due to the collapsed aggregation of the P A s and their high solubility in the solution. Also, the large phase separation of the blends were formed by liquid-liquid phase separation during the film formation, due to too high solubility of the P A s. [67] With a proper amount of FCBS units (0.1-0.3 mole fraction) in the P A s, the PBDB-T:PYTS-0. blends exhibited the optimal extent of phase separation owing to the alleviated P A backbone rigidities and enhanced solubility compared to PYTS-0.0. More importantly, the highest crystalline properties of P A are achieved due to their optimal aggregation behaviors in the solution (middle morphology in Figure 5). These morphological features afford the highest electron mobility and the most balanced μ h /μ e values in the all-PSCs while the charge recombination is most suppressed. In addition, the smooth film surface of the PBDB-T:PYTS-0. the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.3-based all-PSCs exhibited both a high PCE of 14.68% and excellent mechanical robustness (COS of 21.64%, toughness of 3.86 MJ m -3 ). Consequently, we note that reducing local defects and preventing excessive phase-separation in the blends are important for achieving high mechanical robustness of thin-films as well as efficient photovoltaic performances in the PSMA-based all-PSCs.From the combined results of the above morphological analyses, the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.0 blend showed less phase-separated domains compared with those of the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.5 and PBDB-T:PYTS-1.0 blends. However, the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.0 blend contained many defects and large aggregates as observed in the OM images. These were the results of the precipitation of the strongly formed PYTS-0.0 aggregates during the film formation of solution processing due to the highly rigid backbone and low solubility of PYTS-0.0 P A s (left illustration in Figure 5). In this case, the largely aggregated P A s in the films deteriorate charge generation and recombination properties of the all-PSCs, and provide crack propagation pathways by acting stress concentration regions when the mechanical stresses are applied. On the other hand, when the excessive amounts of the FCBS units (over 0.5 mole fraction) are incorporated in the P A s, the blend underwent severe phase-separation between P D and P A domains, in which much less-ordered P A structures were formed as indicated by their low crystallinity (right morphology in Figure 5). These disconnected domains with low crystalline structures can limit electron-hopping from domains to other domains, resulting in lower electron mobility and more severe charge recombination and, thus, limiting the J sc and FF of the all-PSCs. Also, the sharp and weak interfaces between the domains can provide crack propagation routes under tensile loadings, resulting in mechanical failures. We speculate that the weak crystalline structures of the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.5 and PBDB-T:PYTS-1.0 were due to the collapsed aggregation of the P A s and their high solubility in the solution. Also, the large phase separation of the blends were formed by liquid-liquid phase separation during the film formation, due to too high solubility of the P A s. [67] With a proper amount of FCBS units (0.1-0.3 mole fraction) in the P A s, the PBDB-T:PYTS-0. blends exhibited the optimal extent of phase separation owing to the alleviated P A backbone rigidities and enhanced solubility compared to PYTS-0.0. More importantly, the highest crystalline properties of P A are achieved due to their optimal aggregation behaviors in the solution (middle morphology in Figure 5). These morphological features afford the highest electron mobility and the most balanced μ h /μ e values in the all-PSCs while the charge recombination is most suppressed. In addition, the smooth film surface of the PBDB-T:PYTS-0. the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.3-based all-PSCs exhibited both a high PCE of 14.68% and excellent mechanical robustness (COS of 21.64%, toughness of 3.86 MJ m -3 ). Consequently, we note that reducing local defects and preventing excessive phase-separation in the blends are important for achieving high mechanical robustness of thin-films as well as efficient photovoltaic performances in the PSMA-based all-PSCs.</p>
        <p>We have developed a new series of P A s by embedding FCBS units into the rigid backbones, thereby simultaneously enhancing the PV performance and mechanical resilience of all-PSCs. Incorporation of a proper content (0.1-0.3 mol fraction) of the FCBS segment into the P A backbone endowed increased backbone flexibility and solubility to the resulting P A s, thereby alleviating chain rigidity and preventing excessive aggregation in the solution. As a result, the all-PSC based on PBDB-T:PYTS-0.3 exhibited a PCE of 14.68% with significantly enhanced J sc and FF, which is superior to that of the devices based on the P A s without FCBS as the results of optimal morphology, enhanced exciton dissociation, and suppressed monomolecular recombination. Moreover, the improved morphological features of the PBDB-T:PYTS-0.3 blend enabled higher mechanical stretchability and robustness with a COS of 21.64% and toughness of 3.86 MJ m -3 . Our results demonstrate that FCBS can enhance the PV performance and mechanical robustness of the devices concurrently. This strategy provides a new and simple way to develop highly efficient and mechanically robust all-PSCs appropriate for stretchable and flexible electronics.We have developed a new series of P A s by embedding FCBS units into the rigid backbones, thereby simultaneously enhancing the PV performance and mechanical resilience of all-PSCs.
