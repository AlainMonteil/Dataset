        <p>Hyaluronic acid (HA), a non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG), is a major component of skin extracellular matrix (ECM) and it is involved in the inflammatory response, angiogenesis, and tissue regeneration process. Due to the intrinsic properties of HA (such as biocompatibility, biodegradability and hydrophilic character), it has been used to produce different wound dressings, namely sponges, films, hydrogels, and electrospun membranes. Herein, an overview of the different HA-based wound dressings that have been produced so far is provided as well as the future directions regarding the strategies aimed to improve the mechanical stability of HA-based wound dressings, along with the incorporation of biomolecules intended to ameliorate their biological performance during the healing process.Hyaluronic acid (HA), a non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG), is a major component of skin extracellular matrix (ECM) and it is involved in the inflammatory response, angiogenesis, and tissue regeneration process.

        <p>Skin, as a primary immunological barrier of our body, provides protection against microorganisms infiltration and dehydration (Byrd, Belkaid, &amp; Segre, 2018). After a skin injury occurs, induced by physical or thermal agents, the wound healing process is initiated. However, infection, fluid loss, exuberant inflammation and other complications may delay or not allow such process, leading to the emergence of chronic wounds (Byrd et al., 2018;Simões et al., 2018).Skin, as a primary immunological barrier of our body, provides protection against microorganisms infiltration and dehydration (Byrd, Belkaid, &amp; Segre, 2018).

        <p>To circumvent these restrictions of the healing process, different types of biomaterials like sponges, films, hydrogels, electrospun membranes have been developed by researchers from Tissue Engineering area, aiming to produce an ideal wound dressing that is capable of fulfil specific requirements such as: i) provide/assure a moist environment at wound site; ii) improve the epidermal migration, sponsoring the angiogenesis and connective tissue synthesis; iii) allow gas and nutrient exchanges; iv) provide protection against bacterial infection and v) must be sterilizable, non-toxic, biodegradable and non-allergic (Dhivya, Padma, &amp; Santhini, 2015).To circumvent these restrictions of the healing process, different types of biomaterials like sponges, films, hydrogels, electrospun membranes have been developed by researchers from Tissue Engineering area, aiming to produce an ideal wound dressing that is capable of fulfil specific requirements such as: i) provide/assure a moist environment at wound site; ii) improve the epidermal migration, sponsoring the angiogenesis and connective tissue synthesis; iii) allow gas and nutrient exchanges; iv) provide protection against bacterial infection and v) must be sterilizable, non-toxic, biodegradable and non-allergic (Dhivya, Padma, &amp; Santhini, 2015).</p>
        <p>To accomplish such objective, different polymers (poly(caprolactone) (PCL), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), collagen (COL), chitosan (CS), alginate (ALG), hyaluronic acid (HA)) have been used for the production of different wound dressings. Among them, HA or hyaluronan, which is composed of repeating disaccharide units of β-D-glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, alternately linked by β-1,3 and β-1,4 glycosidic bonds (as represented in Fig. 1) has capture the attention of researchers from the Tissue Engineering field (Knopf-Marques et al., 2016).To accomplish such objective, different polymers (poly(caprolactone) (PCL), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), collagen (COL), chitosan (CS), alginate (ALG), hyaluronic acid (HA)) have been used for the production of different wound dressings.

        <p>The large number of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups, available within the HA structure, are responsible for conferring it a highly hydrophilic character. Such feature allows HA to perform exudate absorption as well as enhance cell adhesion. Further, HA biocompatibility, biodegradability (through the enzymatic action of hyaluronidases (HYAL)) and easy chemical modification propelled its application in the wound healing, intending to promote the hemostasis phase, regulate the inflammation and encourage the re-epithelialization process (Mahedia, Shah, &amp; Amirlak, 2016;Mohandas, Anisha, Chennazhi, &amp; Jayakumar, 2015;Zhu, Wang, Yang, &amp; Luo, 2017).The large number of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups, available within the HA structure, are responsible for conferring it a highly hydrophilic character.

        <p>HA is a natural polymer that belongs to a group of heteropolysaccharides known as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which are found in the human vitreous humour, joints, rooster comb, umbilical cord, skin and connective tissue (Fallacara, Baldini, Manfredini, &amp; Vertuani, 2018). In addition, HA can also be obtained through microbial fermentation (Gupta, Lall, Srivastava, &amp; Sinha, 2019;Liu, Liu, Li, Du, &amp; Chen, 2011). HA may present different molecular weights (MW), namely HA oligosaccharides (O-HA, &lt; 1 × 10 4 Da), low molecular weight HA (LMW-HA, 1-25 × 10 4 Da), medium molecular weight HA (MMW-HA, 25-10 × 10 4 Da), high molecular weight HA (HMW-HA, &gt; 1 × 10 6 Da), and very high-molecular weight HA (vHMW-HA, &gt; 6 × 10 6 Da) (Tavianatou et al., 2019).HA is a natural polymer that belongs to a group of heteropolysaccharides known as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which are found in the human vitreous humour, joints, rooster comb, umbilical cord, skin and connective tissue (Fallacara, Baldini, Manfredini, &amp; Vertuani, 2018).

        <p>At physiological pH, each carboxylic group found within HA structure displays an anionic charge. Hence, HA is able to establish Hbonds with the water molecules through the carboxyl and acetamido groups available on HA structure, leading to an stabilization of the secondary structure of this biopolymer (Fallacara et al., 2018). Kobayashi and collaborators reported that the establishment of these Hbonds is dependent on the HA MW, i.e., HA networks displaying an increased stability, viscosity and viscoelasticity are produced when HA with high MW is used (Kobayashi, Okamoto, &amp; Nishinari, 1994). On the other side, the rheological properties of HA are quite dependent on the solution ionic strength, pH and temperature: when the solution pH &lt; 4 or pH &gt; 11, the HA is degraded by hydrolysis, prompting a decline on HA viscosity and polymeric network integrity (Maleki, Kjøniksen, &amp; Nyström, 2008;Miguel, Simões, Moreira, Sequeira, &amp; Correia, 2019).At physiological pH, each carboxylic group found within HA structure displays an anionic charge.

        <p>Such pH influence on HA properties/effectiveness must be considered when HA is aimed to be used for wound healing management, since the wound bed pH suffers a variation along the healing process. After an injury occurs, the pH at the wound site is approximately 8, decreasing to pH≈5 when the healing process ceases (Maleki et al., 2008;Miguel, Simões et al., 2019;Morgado et al., 2014).Such pH influence on HA properties/effectiveness must be considered when HA is aimed to be used for wound healing management, since the wound bed pH suffers a variation along the healing process.

        <p>Immediately after a skin injury occurs, the healing process begins to re-establish, as soon as possible, the skin tissue architecture as well as halt the bleeding (Tavianatou et al., 2019). To accomplish that, platelets release large amounts of HMW-HA, that prompt the deposition of fibrinogen and formation of an initial clot. Further, HA, as a major component of the edema fluid, also promotes the recruitment of neutrophils cells, involved in the phagocytosis of the debris and removal of dead tissue, and the subsequent release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), IL-1β, IL-8 (Tavianatou et al., 2019). Further, the secretion of inflammatory cytokines will also contribute to HMW-HA fragmentation into LMW-HA, which is involved in the recruitment of leucocytes and monocytes, a process that is triggered by the binding of HA to the CD44 receptors available on monocytes and granulocytes' surface (Wolny et al., 2010).Immediately after a skin injury occurs, the healing process begins to re-establish, as soon as possible, the skin tissue architecture as well as halt the bleeding (Tavianatou et al., 2019).

        <p>In the last stage of the inflammatory phase, the lymphocytes and macrophages migrate into the wound site, where their toll-like receptors (TLR2 and TLR4) interact with HA fragments (LMW-HA), and prompt the expression of TNF-α and interleukins such as IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1β (Aya &amp; Stern, 2014;Chen &amp; Abatangelo, 1999;Zamboni, Vieira, Reis, Oliveira, &amp; Collins, 2018). In addition, LMW-HA together with fibronectin guide the fibroblasts invasion and proliferation, which is mandatory for collagen deposition within the wound, as well as promotes the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts (cells expressing smooth-muscle actin and myosin), that play a pivotal role in the wound contraction (Webber, Jenkins, Meran, Phillips, &amp; Steadman, 2009). Moreover, Stern and collaborators demonstrated that HA fragments composed of 6-20 disaccharides can stimulate dermal fibroblast migration and proliferation, with the subsequent deposition of type III collagen, leading to the formation of a new ECM (Stern, Asari, &amp; Sugahara, 2006).In the last stage of the inflammatory phase, the lymphocytes and macrophages migrate into the wound site, where their toll-like receptors (TLR2 and TLR4) interact with HA fragments (LMW-HA), and prompt the expression of TNF-α and interleukins such as IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1β (Aya &amp; Stern, 2014;Chen &amp; Abatangelo, 1999;Zamboni, Vieira, Reis, Oliveira, &amp; Collins, 2018).

        <p>Moreover, in the re-epithelialization phase, CD44 receptors available in keratinocytes cells interact with the LMW-HA present at the wound margins, regulating the re-epithelialization process (Aya &amp; Stern, 2014;Chen &amp; Abatangelo, 1999). An illustration of the HA main roles in the wound healing process is depicted in Fig. 2.Moreover, in the re-epithelialization phase, CD44 receptors available in keratinocytes cells interact with the LMW-HA present at the wound margins, regulating the re-epithelialization process (Aya &amp; Stern, 2014;Chen &amp; Abatangelo, 1999).

        <p>As previously mentioned, HA with different molecular weights (resulting from the cleavage of the polymeric chain), have a distinct effect on the wound. HA with HMW presents anti-inflammatory effect, through the control of the inflammatory cells recruitment, cytokines production and the migration of stem cells (Fallacara et al., 2018). HMW-HA can also inhibit endothelial cell growth as well as limit the supply of nutrients, impairing the skin regeneration process (Dreifke, Jayasuriya, &amp; Jayasuriya, 2015;Gallo et al., 2019). In addition, HMW-HA can interact with the CD44 receptors available on the monocytes and granulocytes surfaces (Fallacara et al., 2018). The HMW-HA-CD44 interaction can affect a variety of intracellular signalling pathways that control biological processes such as: angiogenesis, cell migration, proliferation, and adhesion to ECM components, the elimination of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as the reduction of the DNA damage (Litwiniuk, Krejner, Speyrer, Gauto, &amp; Grzela, 2016). Such interaction is more relevant with HMW-HA because it possesses multivalent sites available to bind to CD44, while oligomers only display one or two binding sites (Wolny et al., 2010;Yang et al., 2012).As previously mentioned, HA with different molecular weights (resulting from the cleavage of the polymeric chain), have a distinct effect on the wound.

        <p>On the other hand, LMW-HA is pro-angiogenic, stimulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as growth factors enrolled in the remodelling of skin ECM (Fallacara et al., 2018). Kouvidi et al. (2011) reported that LMW-HA (15-40 × 10 3 Da) specifically binds to Hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor (RHAMM) in fibrosarcoma cells, triggering the cell adhesion onto fibronectin, while HMW-HA inhibits cell adhesion and the RHAMM expression (Kouvidi et al., 2011). Moreover, O-HA (sized 2-10 disaccharides units) stimulates angiogenesis via RHAMM-mediated signalling pathways in epithelial cells during wound healing. Such observations suggested that RHAMM is expressed during the inflammatory phase of the healing process (Gao, Yang, Mo, Liu, &amp; He, 2008). Matsumoto, Arai, Momose, and Kuroyanagi (2009) produced different sponges using HA with diverse MWs (HMW and LMW), through freeze-drying technique. To obtain crosslinked HMW-HA (cHMW-HA)/ LMW-HA sponges, the HMW-HA sponges were immersed in an LMW-HA solution. The in vivo data obtained revealed that after 1 week, the group treated with cHMW-HA/LMW-HA displayed blood vessels with a higher area (≈ 0.05 mm 2 ), contrasting with ≈ 0.03 mm 2 presented by animals treated with cHMW-HA sponges. Such results demonstrated that the incorporation of LMW-HA on the sponges had a positive effect on the angiogenesis process. Additionally, LMW-HA also evade an exuberant inflammatory response, which was confirmed through the determination of amount of myeloperoxidase (MPO) present in neutrophils (the presence of this inflammatory enzyme is proportional to the extension of the inflammatory process) (Matsumoto et al., 2009).On the other hand, LMW-HA is pro-angiogenic, stimulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as growth factors enrolled in the remodelling of skin ECM (Fallacara et al., 2018).

        <p>On the other side, the O-HA (MW &lt; 10 4 Da) resulting from the degradation of HA, through the action of HYAL or ROS, also play important roles in the healing process (Fallacara et al., 2018;Knopf-Marques et al., 2016). O-HA displays pro-angiogenic activity, i.e. it stimulates the migration and differentiation of endothelial cells as well as enhance the migration and proliferation of dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes (Fallacara et al., 2018). In a recent study, Wang, Han, Guo, and Huang (2016) noticed that O-HA prompted the in vitro migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) into the wounded area, i.e. ≈ 30 % the wound was covered with HUVECs incubated with O-HA cream, while in control group only ≈ 15 % of wound area was covered by these cells. On the other hand, the animals (diabetic rats) treated with O-HA cream also presented a lower expression of CD31, increased capillary density and blood supply, as well as improved granulation and re-epithelization of the wound.On the other side, the O-HA (MW &lt; 10 4 Da) resulting from the degradation of HA, through the action of HYAL or ROS, also play important roles in the healing process (Fallacara et al., 2018;Knopf-Marques et al., 2016).

        <p>HA is also known by its high versality. Researchers have functionalized the polymeric backbone of HA with different functional groups in order to improve its mechanical, rheological and swelling properties as well as to modulate its degradation rate (Fallacara et al., 2018). The hydroxyl and the carboxyl groups present in HA structure are usually selected to perform its chemical modification (Schanté, Zuber, Herlin, &amp; Vandamme, 2011). The hydroxyl groups of HA have been chemically modified with mono-or bi-functional agents, resulting in different HA derivatives like ethers, hemiacetals, esters and carbamates (Fallacara et al., 2018). In a work performed by Laurent, Gelotte, and Hellsing (1964), HA was crosslinked for the first time with 1,2,3,4-diepoxybutane to improve its stability in aqueous solutions. In a similar way, Piron and Tholin, 2005 mixed butanediol-diglycidylether in sodium hydroxide solution and added to the HA powder, leading to the formation of a homogeneous and stable hydrogel (Piron &amp; Tholin, 2005).HA is also known by its high versality.

        <p>HA hydroxyl groups have been also functionalized with alkyl succinic anhydrides, such as octenyl succinic anhydride, under alkaline conditions. In this reaction, the hydroxyl groups of HA react with the anhydride to form ester bonds aimed to improve the mechanical properties as well as decrease the degradation rate of HA (Tommeraas &amp; Eenschooten, 2009). Moreover, the HA esterification with methacrylic anhydride has been also performed to obtain methacrylated HA. The presence of methacrylate groups enabled the photo-crosslinking of the HA derivatives (Burdick, Chung, Jia, Randolph, &amp; Langer, 2005;Seidlits et al., 2010).HA hydroxyl groups have been also functionalized with alkyl succinic anhydrides, such as octenyl succinic anhydride, under alkaline conditions.

        <p>The activation of polymeric carboxyl groups of HA involves esterification and amidation processes (Schanté et al., 2011). The esterification can be performed by alkylation of HA carboxyl groups using alkyl halides or tosylate activation (Huin-Amargier, Marchal, Payan, Netter, &amp; Dellacherie, 2006). Moreover, HA esters can be synthesized using diazomethane as the activator of the carboxyl groups. In turn, the HA amidation with 1,1´-carbonyldiimidazole or 2-chloro-1-methylpyridinium iodide, as activating agents, is also performed (Hirano et al., 2005;Huin-Amargier et al., 2006). However, the most efficient mechanism to perform the activation of HA carboxyl groups is by using carbodiimide (i.e. N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N´-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride) and co-activators like N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) or 1-hydroxybenzotriazole in water. The activation with carbodiimide allows the formation of ester bonds between the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups, leading to the production of biomaterials with improved stiffness and resistance to degradation (Bulpitt &amp; Aeschlimann, 1999;Kaczmarek, Sionkowska, Kozlowska, &amp; Osyczka, 2018;Kirk et al., 2013).

        <p>Nowadays, different HA-based wound dressings, such as HylaSponge® System, Hyalomatrix® and Hyalosafe®, are available to be used in the clinic (Longinotti, 2014;Mahedia et al., 2016) (as described in Table 1). The HylaSponge® System is produced through a free-radical polymerization process, leading to the formation of a complex HA network that is capable of providing protection and grant a high hydration to the wound site (Mahedia et al., 2016). Hyalomatrix® is a flexible, conformable and bilayered dermal substitute conceived to promote wound closure as well as dermis regeneration. The bottom layer (layer in contact with the wound) is a 3D fibrous matrix composed of HYAFF® 11, whereas the top layer is formed by a thin sheet of transparent silicone. HYAFF® 11 is a HA-derived, which is obtained through the esterification of the free carboxylic group of HA with benzyl alcohol (Longinotti, 2014). This esterification process prevents the water infiltration into the macromolecule, i.e. increases the hydrophobic character of HA. Further, such process also increases the degradation time of the polymer: 75 % of esterified HA degrades over the course of 7-14 days, while the 95 % esterified HA may require up to 2 months to degrade (Benedetti et al., 1993;Fallacara et al., 2018).Nowadays, different HA-based wound dressings, such as HylaSponge® System, Hyalomatrix® and Hyalosafe®, are available to be used in the clinic (Longinotti, 2014;Mahedia et al., 2016) (as described in Table 1).

        <p>In addition, the transparency of the top layer is fundamental to perform a continuous monitoring of the healing process (Longinotti, 2014). Gravante et al. (2010) and Osti (2008) evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of Hyalomatrix® in clinical assays and the data obtained revealed that after 29 days of treatment, a complete wound closure was achieved in 85.7 % of the patients (28/57), while 14.3 % of them only displayed a partial re-epithelization.In addition, the transparency of the top layer is fundamental to perform a continuous monitoring of the healing process (Longinotti, 2014).

        <p>In turn, Hyalosafe® is a transparent film used for the treatment of second-degree superficial burns. The degradation of this film leads to the release of HA, that encourages the proliferation of epithelial cells (Longinotti, 2014). Apart from the physicochemical and biological properties of HAbased wound dressings, the sterilization of these dressings is also crucial for their application in tissue engineering (Galante, Pinto, Colaço, &amp; Serro, 2018). The sterilization method used may impact on the mechanical, chemical and biological properties of HA-based wound dressings (Galante et al., 2018;Huerta-Angeles, Nesporova, Ambrozova, Kubala, &amp; Velebny, 2018;O'Connell et al., 2019). In the literature, natural polysaccharide-based biomaterials are usually sterilized through filtration, high-pressure-high-temperature (autoclave), ethylene oxide gas, UV-radiation, gamma-radiation and electron beam (Huerta-Angeles et al., 2018).In turn, Hyalosafe® is a transparent film used for the treatment of second-degree superficial burns.

        <p>Indeed, despite all the efforts that have been performed so far, the commercially available HA-based wound dressings, still present some shortcomings, namely high production costs, possible presence of contaminants (due to the extraction process used to obtain HA), limited cell adhesion/proliferation and low mechanical stability (Gallo et al., 2019). To overcome these drawbacks, researchers from the Tissue Engineering area have been developing alternative solutions. In the following sections, different examples HA-based wound dressings (namely sponges, films, hydrogels, and electrospun membranes) are highlighted.Indeed, despite all the efforts that have been performed so far, the commercially available HA-based wound dressings, still present some shortcomings, namely high production costs, possible presence of contaminants (due to the extraction process used to obtain HA), limited cell adhesion/proliferation and low mechanical stability (Gallo et al., 2019).

        <p>Sponges, due to their biodegradability, porosity, and swelling profile, are capable of absorbing large amounts of wound exudate, as well as maintain a moist environment at the wound site (Simões et al., 2018;Villamizar-Sarmiento et al., 2019). Further, the sponges are generally non-adhesive and require secondary dressings or tapes/bandages that grant their maintenance at the wound site (Simões et al., 2018). To surpass the weak mechanical properties exhibited by sponges, researchers have been combining HA with other polymers or producing HA derivatives through chemical synthesis (as listed in Table 2).Sponges, due to their biodegradability, porosity, and swelling profile, are capable of absorbing large amounts of wound exudate, as well as maintain a moist environment at the wound site (Simões et al., 2018;Villamizar-Sarmiento et al., 2019).

        <p>Anisha, Biswas, Chennazhi, and Jayakumar (2013) incorporated silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) into CS/HA sponges to improve their bactericidal activity and propel their use in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. The antimicrobial activity of the produced sponges was assessed using Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as model bacteria. The obtained results show that CS-HA loaded with different concentrations of AgNPs (0.001 %, 0.005 %, and 0.01 %) induced the formation of inhibitory halos with diameter values of 7 ± 1 mm, 11 ± 2 mm and 14 ± 2 mm for S. aureus; 8 ± 1 mm, 11 ± 2 mm and 13 ± 2 mm for E. coli, and 9 ± 1 mm, 10 ± 2 mm and 10 ± 2 mm were noticed for MRSA. Such values demonstrate that the incorporation of AgNPs (even at low concentrations) into CS-HA sponges avoided bacterial growth, without compromising the eukaryotic cell viability, evidencing the potential of this composite sponge for being applied in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers infected with multidrug-resistant bacteria (Anisha et al., 2013).Anisha, Biswas, Chennazhi, and Jayakumar (2013) incorporated silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) into CS/HA sponges to improve their bactericidal activity and propel their use in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.

        <p>Matsumoto and Kuroyanagi (2010) functionalized HA (MW = 2 × 10 6 Da) -based sponges with arginine (Arg) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) and then they evaluated sponges' performance in the healing process. Full-thickness wounds (15 mm of diameter) were induced on rats' skin and, after one week, they noticed that animals treated with sponges containing Arg and EGF presented a significant decrease in the wound area. Further, the ability of sponges to control the inflammatory response was also assessed through the determination of amount of MPO produced by neutrophils. The obtained results show that the Arg induces a moderate inflammatory response (≈ 0.13 units/ mg of MPO) in the group treated with c-HMW-HA/LMW-HA/Arg sponge, contrasting with ≈0.21 units/mg of MPO in the group treated with c-HMW-HA/LMW-HA/Arg/EGF.

        <p>Films are highly elastic and flexible structures, composed of adherent and transparent polymers that allow O 2 and CO 2 exchange, as well as water vapor transmission from the wound site and avoid bacteria penetration.

        <p>Up to now, the development of HA-based films has been focused on the enhancement of their biological performance, through the incorporation of bioactive molecules (like growth factors, natural product extracts and sulfadiazine (SD)), and inorganic compounds. Furthermore, these films have been also functionalized with other polymers or HA-derivatives. Examples of the strategies used to improve the biological properties of the HA-based films aimed to be used for the treatment of wounds are listed in Table 3. Li et al. (2018) produced for the first time HA-based films using HA (MW = 5.4 × 10 3 Da) grafted pullulan (HA-g-Pu) in order to enhance HA stability and biological performance during the healing process. The acquired data showed that the HA-g-Pu films presented a higher swelling ratio (40 %) in comparison to the pullulan (Pu) and HA films (≈ 30 % and ≈ 34 %, respectively). Further, HA films presented a 100 % of weight loss after ± 3 days of incubation, whereas the HA-g-Pu films only become completely degraded after 12-14 days. Thus, confirming that the grafting of Pu into HA chain improved the films' water stability. In addition, the SEM analysis demonstrated that the HA-g-Pu films presented a porous structure with an average pore size of 73.13 ± 29.36 μm, which is compatible with cell migration. Finally, the in vitro and in vivo results showed that HA-g-Pu films are biocompatible, and a faster wound healing process occurred for those animals covered with the produced film (Li et al., 2018).Up to now, the development of HA-based films has been focused on the enhancement of their biological performance, through the incorporation of bioactive molecules (like growth factors, natural product extracts and sulfadiazine (SD)), and inorganic compounds.

        <p>Furthermore, other researchers have also been working to ameliorate the antibacterial properties of HA-based films for improving the healing process. Eskandarinia et al. (2019) produced a cornstarch (CSH)/HA (MW = 1.73-1.54 × 10 5 Da) dressing through the incorporation of an ethanolic extract of propolis (EEP), using a casting technique. The EEP release profile was studied, and the results show that 60 %, 69 % and 74 % of EEP were released from CSH/HA/0.25 % EEP, CSH/HA/0.5 %EEP and CSH/HA/1%EEP films after 48 h, respectively. Such EEP release profile can grant an aseptic environment at wound site, during at least 48 h. In fact, the CSH/HA/EEP 0.25 %, CSH/ HA/EEP 0.5 % and CSH/HA/EEP 1% films induced the formation of inhibitory halos with diameter values of 0.93 ± 0.25 mm, 2.08 ± 0.14 mm and 4.68 ± 0.12 mm for S. aureus, 1.21 ± 0.39 mm, 2.64 ± 0.18 mm and 4.33 ± 0.27 mm for E. coli, and 0 mm, 1.02 ± 0.15 mm and 2.92 ± 0.26 mm for Staphylococcus epidermidis. In addition, these films were also applied on wounds induced in animals. The attained results show that the wounds treated with films (as can be observed in Fig. 4), were almost healed after 14 days, whereas those only covered with gauze did not. Such results clearly demonstrated that the CSH/HA films loaded with EEP have potential to enhance the healing process as well as inhibit microorganisms' growth at the surface of the wound (Eskandarinia et al., 2019).Furthermore, other researchers have also been working to ameliorate the antibacterial properties of HA-based films for improving the healing process.

        <p>In a similar way, Abou-Okeil, Fahmy, El-Bisi, and Ahmed-Farid (2018) produced HA/sodium alginate (SA) films crosslinked with Ca 2+ , Zn 2+ , and Cu 2+ metal cations. Then, the physicochemical properties determined for these films revealed that HA/SA films crosslinked with Ca 2+ showed the most promising properties. To improve the antimicrobial activity of HA/SA films, AgNPs and SD were incorporated into these films. The in vivo data obtained show that the wounds treated with these films display a higher reduction of the wound area. In addition, HA also prompted a decreased production of inflammatory mediators (nitric oxide), as well as oxidative stress markers (malondialdehyde).In a similar way, Abou-Okeil, Fahmy, El-Bisi, and Ahmed-Farid (2018) produced HA/sodium alginate (SA) films crosslinked with Ca 2+ , Zn 2+ , and Cu 2+ metal cations.

A similar trend was also observed for the antimicrobial activity, i.e. a higher concentration of the FZIF-8 nanoparticles lead to an improved bactericidal effect.

To widening their applicability, researchers have been pursuing different strategies to improve hydrogels features, some of them listed in Table 4. Wu et al.

Initially, these authors prepared different ratios of GEL and HA (8:2, 5:5 and 2:8), that were subsequently crosslinked with 0.1 % EDC, in order to promote the chemical interaction between compounds. Through the morphological characterization, it was possible to verify that the use of a crosslinking agent did not impair the porous structure of GEL-HA hydrogels (which presented a total porosity of 40 %-70 %, with an average pore size of 100-400 mm), a feature that is essential for cell infiltration and gaseous/nutrients exchange. Furthermore, the in vivo assays demonstrated that the wounds treated with GEL/HA 8:2 hydrogel had a decrease in the area of ≈ 95 %, thus demonstrating that the combination between GEL and HA provide a suitable moist environment for fibroblasts proliferation and migration.The multilayer films demonstrated great potential for supporting the skin wound healing.

(2018) compared the potential of uncrosslinked/crosslinked HA hydrogels (MW = 2 × 10 6 Da) (HA1 and HA2, respectively) to be used in the treatment of full-thickness skin injuries induced in rabbits. The results obtained show that the wound area of animals treated with HA2 was smaller than that displayed by the other groups (control, HA and HA1) after 14 days. In addition, the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), VEGF and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) were also quantified. A higher expression of α-SMA and VEGF was accomplished for the HA2 treated group, which is indicative of high proliferation of myofibroblasts as well as the occurrence of the angiogenesis process, respectively. On the other hand, the TGF-β expression was reduced for HA2 group. Such decrease is important to attain a smaller inflammatory response and a reduced scar formation. Overall, the results obtained reveal that HA2 (crosslinked HA hydrogel) presented the most auspicious properties for future application on wound therapy (Hong et al., 2018).In another study, Hong et al.

Based on the collected data, animals treated with COL-HA hydrogels exhibited a decrease of 96.44 ± 0.47 % of the wound area, whereas those treated with COL-P and HA-Tyr hydrogels presented a reduction of 93.87 ± 1.12 % and 93.83 ± 2.81 % of the wound area after 2 weeks, respectively. Fiorica et al.

The release assays demonstrated that the produced hydrogels retained the VEGF, and approximately 50 % of the incorporated growth factor remains within polymeric network, after 5 days of incubation. An appropriate VEGF release profile is fundamental to stimulate the proliferation of HUVECs enrolled in the formation of the new blood vessels during the wound healing process. Shi et al.

The in vitro assays showed that the produced hydrogels were able to inhibit the growth S. aureus and E. coli. Furthermore, the in vivo assays demonstrated that the animals treated with hydrogel presented a lower wound area in comparison to the non-treated group, 6 days after the wound be induced (as can be observed in Fig. 5).

        <p>The oxidation degree of AHA had a direct impact on biocompatibility and rheological properties of hydrogels; Nguyen et al. (2019) (continued on next page) accomplish the production of such wound dressings (Augustine, Kalarikkal, &amp; Thomas, 2016, 2018;Miguel et al., 2018;Miguel, Sequeira et al., 2019). HA has been selected by researchers for the production of electrospun membranes, since it is an ECM component, presents high-water retention capacity, biodegradability and beneficial effects on wound healing process (Aya &amp; Stern, 2014;Chanda et al., 2018;Shin et al., 2016). However, the electrospinning of pure solutions of HA is extremely difficult. To overcome this shortcoming, researchers have been blending HA with synthetic polymers (to enhance its mechanical properties as well as electrospinnability) and natural polymers or bioactive agents (to augment the HA' biological performance). In Table 5, are summarized the different strategies followed so far to produce HA-based electrospun membranes aimed for wound healing applications. Kenar et al. (2019) prepared a blend of HA with COL and poly(Llactide-co-ε-caprolactone) (PLC), that was then used to produce a nanofibrous membrane able to support cell proliferation and promote the vascularization process. The characterization of morphological properties and swelling profile of the produced membrane demonstrated that the PLC/COL/HA fibers presented a lower diameter values (569 ± 188 nm) and a higher water uptake capacity (103 ± 13 %), in comparison to the PLC membrane (which presented mean diameter values of 641 ± 104 nm and 66 ± 4% of swelling ability). Further, these authors also noticed that the HA membranes promoted the vascularization process (Kenar et al., 2019). Shin et al. (2016) produced co-axial nanofibers of HA (MW = 0.8-1.8 × 10 6 Da) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) loaded with epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG) (HA/PLGA-E), through coaxial electrospinning, aiming to use them for the treatment of full thickness wounds. The data obtained in this study revealed that the animals treated with HA/PLGA-E membranes presented a lower wound size after 14 days of treatment, in comparison with the other groups (as presented in Fig. 6). Such results suggest that a synergistic effect occurs between HA and EGCG and it can improve the healing process by scavenging ROS, mitigating inflammation, enhancing the re-epithelialization, promoting angiogenesis and ECM re-organization. Overall, these results reveal the potential of HA/PLGA-E core/shell fiber matrices to be used in the treatment of diabetic wounds.The oxidation degree of AHA had a direct impact on biocompatibility and rheological properties of hydrogels; Nguyen et al.

        <p>More recently, the electrospinning technique has also been explored for the production of bilayered membranes, which are aimed to reproduce both layers of the skin, i.e. the epidermis and dermis (Miguel, Sequeira et al., 2019). In these membranes, the top layer is conceived to avoid bacterial invasion and wound dehydration, whereas the bottom layer is aimed to remove the wound exudate and promote cell infiltration and proliferation (Miguel, Ribeiro, Coutinho, &amp; Correia, 2017;Miguel, Sequeira et al., 2019). Chanda et al. (2018) produced an electrospun bilayered membrane composed of a CS/PCL and HA (MW = 1-2 × 10 6 Da) /Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) layer. The bilayered membranes were produced through the deposition of nanofibrous HA/PEO layer over pre-formed layers of CS/PCL, in order to obtain membranes with the required mechanical properties. Overall, the bilayered CS/PCL-HA-PEO dressing showed improved physicochemical and biological properties (biocompatibility, promoting cell adhesion and proliferation), that are essential for its application as a wound dressing. Figueira, Miguel, de Sá, and Correia (2016) produced bilayer membranes composed of a dense top layer (formed by HA (MW = 1.5-2.2 × 10 6 Da) and PCL), and a bottom layer (produced with CS and zein (ZN)) loaded with salicylic acid. These authors used HA to produce the top layer aiming to mimic the epidermis' layer of the skin. The HA_PCL nanofibers produced through electrospinning displayed a mean diameter value of 472 ± 192 nm, which is within the range displayed by collagen fibers (50-500 nm) found in skin. Such feature promoted cell proliferation, differentiation and adhesion. Furthermore, the HA_PCL membranes' porosity below 90 % and a water contact angle OHEC was used as biological crosslinking agent to promote the gelation process;More recently, the electrospinning technique has also been explored for the production of bilayered membranes, which are aimed to reproduce both layers of the skin, i.e. the epidermis and dermis (Miguel, Sequeira et al., 2019).

(2019) produced an asymmetric electrospun membrane composed of PCL and SF in the top layer and HA (MW = 8-15 × 10 3 Da) plus SF in the bottom one. The authors combined HA with SF to produce a layer that mimics the dermis' properties. Additionally, they also incorporated thymol (THY) into this layer, in order to confer it antioxidant and antibacterial properties. The SF_HA_THY nanofibrous bottom layer presented a total porosity of 85.24 ± 2.47 %, which is compatible with cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation. Moreover, the authors also analysed the swelling capacity of the SF_HA_THY membrane and the data obtained revealed that this membrane had a higher swelling ratio values (≈ 45 and ≈ 39, at pH 8 and at pH 5, respectively). Thus, demonstrating that the bottom layer is able to provide a moist environment, avoid wound dehydration as well as remove the wound exudate. Moreover, the SF_HA_THY layer possessed a hydrophilic character (WCA value of 38.77 ± 5.32°), which is considered an ideal wettability for cell adhesion and proliferation. The in vitro assays showed that the presence of HA in the membranes improved the fibroblasts' attachment and proliferation on membrane surface (confirmed by SEM and confocal scanning laser microscope images).

        <p>HA is a major component of the ECM of the skin, that plays crucial roles in the wound healing process, like promoting the formation of a fibrin clot, production and release of interleukins and proinflammatory cytokines. In addition, it also encourages the fibroblasts/keratinocytes proliferation as well as propels the fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts. Apart from these biological effects, HA is also characterized by its hydrophilicity, biocompatibility, and ability to be chemically modified, widening its applicability to different areas. In this way, different HA-based wound dressings have been produced so far, namely sponges, hydrogels, films, and electrospun membranes, where different strategies have been followed to overcome the low water stability and weak mechanical properties of HA, as well as increment its biological performance. Overall, the presence of the HA in these dressings improves their porosity and swelling (features that are essential to enhance the O 2 and nutrients exchanges), promotes the exudate absorption besides potentiates the cell migration and proliferation. Moreover, HA also decreases the inflammatory cells infiltration, improves the reepithelization and granulation as well as increases the formation of blood vessels, that are of utmost importance for improving skin regeneration. However, despite all the promising properties exhibited by HA-based wound dressings, they still present some limitations, such as low mechanical stability and inappropriate biodegradation profile. Up to now, the chemical modifications performed, aiming to increase the stability of HA-based wound dressings, using toxic agents and involving complex reactions, which can compromise the wound dressings' biocompatibility. Further, the rapid and high in vitro/in vivo degradation of HA demands a periodic replacement of wound dressing, which may lead to the formation of new lesions, tissue exacerbation, increased risk of infection as well as pain to the patient.HA is a major component of the ECM of the skin, that plays crucial roles in the wound healing process, like promoting the formation of a fibrin clot, production and release of interleukins and proinflammatory cytokines.

        <p>In a near future, these aspects need to be further addressed by using alternative approaches (e.g. solvent-free methods and "click chemistry") to produce HA derivatives that fulfil the required properties. Such approaches will overcome the use of toxic agents and contribute for enhancing the mechanical properties of HA-based dressings. Furthermore, a reproductible process to accomplish the production of HA derivatives is required and their pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties must be optimized to allow their successful commercialization.
