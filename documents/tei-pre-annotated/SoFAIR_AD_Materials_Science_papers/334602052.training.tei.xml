        <p>Defects are now recognized to be a useful tool in tailoring properties of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The introduction of missing linker and cluster defects into MOFs provides additional active sites, optimizes the acidity/basicity, improves the conductivity, tailors mechanical responses and creates more pore space to enhance diffusion and mass transfer in MOFs. Structural defects in MOFs have been demonstrated to be beneficial in areas such as catalysis, decontamination, bio-applications, adsorption, separation, energy storage, energy conversion, electronics, magnetics, optical functional materials, etc. The defective MOFs are also excellent model materials for the fundamental study of defect chemistry. In this review, we provide a general overview of the commonly available methods that are feasible for the creation and characterization of structural defects in MOF materials.Defects are now recognized to be a useful tool in tailoring properties of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs).

        <p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), the unique porous crystalline materials assembled by the coordination bonds of inorganic metal ions with organic ligands, have received remarkable attention over the past decade due to their designable porosity, surface chemistry, and the functionalization of the coordination space. [1][2][3] There is escalating interest in the defect engineering of MOFs. Defects have now been recognized to be a useful tool to tailor the physical-chemical properties of MOFs, such as adsorption capacity, [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12] band structures, [13][14][15] conductivity, 16,17 mechanical responses, 18,19 and catalytic properties . Up to now, both experimental and theoretical calculation studies have demonstrated that a certain degree of structural defects can offer positive effects on the physical and chemical properties of MOF materials. [41][42][43][44] However, it is also noted that defects sometimes result in negative effects on some MOF properties such as the gas adsorption and diffusion as well as optical properties. 45 In addition, structural defects are often associated with a decreased chemical, thermal, and mechanical stability of the framework structures. Therefore, the framework must take into account its stability and provide tolerance to such defects. Wang et al. 45 summarized several efficient strategies for overcoming defects of HKUST-1. How to fully use the specific properties of MOF materials endowed by the structural defects is a key factor for practical purposes.Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), the unique porous crystalline materials assembled by the coordination bonds of inorganic metal ions with organic ligands, have received remarkable attention over the past decade due to their designable porosity, surface chemistry, and the functionalization of the coordination space.

        <p>The defects in MOFs have been defined as "sites that locally break the regular periodic arrangement of atoms or ions of the static crystalline parent framework because of missing or dislocated atoms or ions". 46 In a general way, the defects can be classified into point, line, and planar defects in the geometric scale. Within the field of MOFs, point defects have been subject to intense focus and have been widely investigated in various fields due to their important influence on properties of MOFs. 42,43,47 The most important two types of point defects in MOF materials are missing-linker defects and missing-cluster defects (Fig. 1). In the case of zirconium-based MOFs, missing-linker defects are generated when an organic linker is removed from the structure, leaving coordination vacancies on two adjacent metal clusters (Fig. 1a to b). Whereas missing-cluster defects are the result of the removal of a [Zr 6 O 4 (OH) 4 ] 12+ cluster together with its entire set of twelve organic linkers, generating one coordination vacancy on each of the neighboring clusters (Fig. 1a to c). Essentially, missing-cluster defects are a result of the critical concentration of missing-linker defects and their spatial distribution. 47 However, it is noted that the equilibrium between these two types of point defects, missing-linker and missing-cluster defects, is still not clear. In the most cases, missing-linker and missing-cluster defects are only indirectly accessible through conventional methods. Recently, the structural defects in UiO-66 (Universitetet i Oslo 66, Zr 6 (OH) 4 O 4 (BDC) 6 , BDC = benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate) have been imaged at a sub-unit-cell resolution. 48 This work provides direct evidence to support the existence of missing linker and missing cluster defects in MOFs. Many MOFs, even the most carefully synthesized MOFs, are known to contain structural defects. Although defect engineering in MOFs is still in its infancy, a significant effort has been devoted to detecting and controlling defects. 42 There has been a growing interest in understanding the formation of these defects and exploiting their various practical applications. 41 It is expected that defect engineering in MOFs will continue to move forward in the coming years with the development of advanced characterization technologies and the further understanding of defect chemistry in MOFs.The defects in MOFs have been defined as "sites that locally break the regular periodic arrangement of atoms or ions of the static crystalline parent framework because of missing or dislocated atoms or ions". 46 In a general way, the defects can be classified into point, line, and planar defects in the geometric scale.

        <p>Judicious choices of synthetic conditions have been demonstrated to effectively promote the generation of defects in the de novo synthesis of MOF materials. Among these choices, the most common way is the addition of the so-called modulators (e.g., monocarboxylic acids) to the linker molecules during the synthesis of MOFs. 47 A number of key factors have been considered for the generation of defects in the synthesis of MOFs, including solvent, the type of modulators, the number of modulators and the crystal growth rate. 42,49 To date, several typical monocarboxylic modulators, including formic acid (FA), 6,50 acetic acid, 23,25,27 difluoro acetic acid (DFA), 51 trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 29 benzoic acid (BA), 7 and others 33,52,53 have been applied in the synthesis of defective MOFs. Shearer et al. 51 systematically investigated the effect of modulators (acetic acid, FA, TFA, and DFA) on the defect chemistry of UiO-66.Judicious choices of synthetic conditions have been demonstrated to effectively promote the generation of defects in the de novo synthesis of MOF materials.

        <p>Besides monocarboxylic modulators, nitrogenous heterocyclic modulators (e.g., 1-methylimidazole) have also been recently reported. 28 The modulation of the temperature also plays an important role in the de novo synthesis of defective MOFs.

        <p>Recently, Jiang et al. 53 reported a versatile modulator-induced defect-formation strategy for the rational design and controllable synthesis of hierarchically porous MOFs (HP-MOFs) with high stability. The excessive modulator alkyl monocarboxylic acid coordinates to the metal ions for the formation of metal-oxo clusters, while the alkyl chain creates structural defects and additional pore space (Fig. 3c). Moreover, the pore space can be tuned via altering the length and concentration of the modulator (Fig. 3d-f). The defect-formation strategy to create hierarchical pores in MOF materials has been summarized in previous reviews. 55,56 Additionally, the previously reported works demonstrated that the modulator-induced missing linker defects can be successfully eliminated via linker exchange. 57,58 In addition to the synthesis temperature and the modulators, water has also been confirmed to play an important role in the synthesis of defect phases of UiO family MOFs. 59 Previous work showed that water and hydroxide can introduce missing-linker defects into the framework by replacing the bidentate dicarboxylate linkers. 59 In addition, the mixed-linker approach represents another efficient strategy to create defects in MOF structures. Larger linkers with different coordinating groups can partially substitute linkers from a parent framework in de novo synthesis. The mixed-linker approach can increase the number of defect sites or active sites by incorporating another linker with various unique functionalities. 34,[60][61][62][63] By using this mixed-linker approach, Epp et al. 61 successfully introduced point defects at the distinct Ru 2 paddlewheel nodes in ruthenium MOF Ru-HKUST-1. Mixtures of benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate and pyridine-3,5-dicarboxylate linkers were used in the mixed-linker approach.Recently, Jiang et al. 53 reported a versatile modulator-induced defect-formation strategy for the rational design and controllable synthesis of hierarchically porous MOFs (HP-MOFs) with high stability.

        <p>Recently, a powerful strategy combining the mixed-linker approach and the labile linker decomposition has been developed to create structural defects and hierarchical pores in MOFs. 64,65 The stable linkers and labile linkers are firstly incorporated into the MOF structure via a mixed-linker approach, followed by the post-synthetic decomposition of the labile linkers. As a result of the decomposition of labile linkers, rich missing-linker defects were formed (Fig. 4a). To date, hydrolysis, 64 thermolysis, 11,65,66 ozonolysis, 67 and laser photolysis 68 have been reported to eliminate labile linkers selectively. Zhou et al. 66 Importantly, Zhou et al. 68 further developed a laser photolytic process for the removal of the photolabile linker (TCPP), creating mesopores within microporous MOF UiO-66 in tens of milliseconds. The laser photolysis precisely controls the size and spatial arrangement of hierarchical pores, while ensuring the stability and integrity of the original framework.Recently, a powerful strategy combining the mixed-linker approach and the labile linker decomposition has been developed to create structural defects and hierarchical pores in MOFs. 64,65 The stable linkers and labile linkers are firstly incorporated into the MOF structure via a mixed-linker approach, followed by the post-synthetic decomposition of the labile linkers.

        <p>Additionally, novel de novo synthesis methods have been recently reported to introduce defects in MOF materials. 12,30,32 Hu et al. 30 used a microfluidic laminar flow for the synthesis of enzyme-embedded defect-rich MOFs, which are difficult to achieve using a conventional bulk solution synthesis (Fig. 5a-b). Under a continuously changed concentration of MOF precursors in the gradient mixing on-chip (Fig. 5c), the resulted products showed structural defects and therefore, mesopores. The defect property (like the pore width and pore volume) can be controlled by adjusting the flow rate of the reactants into the microchannel. Similarly, templated electrosynthesis has been recently reported with the ability to integrate mesopores and crystal defects into MOFs (Fig. 5d). 32 An ionic liquid was used as both an electrolyte and template in the templated electrosynthesis. The mesoporous Cu(II)-MOF MFM-100 with crystal defects was successfully obtained via self-aggregation. The formation of crystal defects with uncoupled Cu(II) centers can be evidenced by confocal fluorescence microscopy (CFM) analysis (Fig. 5e andf).

        <p>In addition to the "de novo" synthetic approaches to introduce structural defects in MOFs, another synthetic approach toward defective MOFs is post-synthetic treatment. 69 Post-synthetic treatment involves a heterogeneous treatment of the parent MOFs with modified linkers, 70 etching agents, 36,71 or other harsh activation procedures (e.g., thermal activation 72,73 and plasma activation 74 ).In addition to the "de novo" synthetic approaches to introduce structural defects in MOFs, another synthetic approach toward defective MOFs is post-synthetic treatment. 69 Post-synthetic treatment involves a heterogeneous treatment of the parent MOFs with modified linkers, 70 etching agents, 36,71 or other harsh activation procedures (e.g., thermal activation 72,73 and plasma activation 74 ).</p>
        <p>The most established post-synthetic treatment method is post-synthetic exchange (PSE), involving the metathesis of metal ions or ligands from intact MOFs. 58,70,75 Metal ion exchange process involves a substitution of original metal ions with other metal ions that has a different coordination number compared to the original metal ions in MOFs. 41,76 The post-synthetic exchange of ligands, also known as solvent-assisted linker exchange, can replace the parent ligands of the MOF with other modified ligands via a heterogeneous reaction using a suitable solvent. PSE can introduce diverse chemical functionalities and defect sites in existing MOF structures using the modified ligands (e.g., functionalized ligands 77 or ligands with an incorporated catalyst precursor 70 ). Importantly, PSE provides a new route for the synthesis of novel MOF materials that are difficult to prepare through other traditional synthetic methods. 77 Another common route in post-synthetic treatment for defect generation in MOFs involves etching agents (e.g., acid, base, and salts). 8,36,71,[78][79][80] The etching process introduces not only missing linker/cluster defects but also mesopores and even macropores in microporous MOFs. For example, Gu et al. 79 reported a simple and effective acid etching strategy to introduce structural defects and mesopores in UiO-66. Propionic acid partially replaces the bridging ligands in UiO-66 and leads to the departure of partial ligands and metal clusters. Similarly, potassium hydroxide leads to the formation of missing-linker defects and the presence of extra-framework cations in nickel pyrazolate MOFs. 8 Chang et al. 36 used tetrafluoroborate as both functional sites and etching agents to create defects and mesopores in microporous Al-MOF. A possible mechanism to illustrate the formation of the defect-mesopores is shown in Fig. 6a. The loading of copper(II) tetrafluoroborate cleaves the existing chemical bonds between Al 3+ and the carboxyl group to generate the defect-induced mesopores. The mesopore size and active sites can be precisely tuned by carefully controlling the loading amount of the salt etching agent. A low concentration of salt only resulted in a relatively mild etching of the crystal structure, whilst a high concentration loading could induce a deep etching of the framework (Fig. 6a).

A low concentration of salt only resulted in a relatively mild etching of the crystal structure, whilst a high concentration loading could induce a deep etching of the framework (Fig. 6a).

        <p>Recently, plasma etching, a green and facile technology, has been developed to generate defects in MOF materials. 21,44,74,81 Plasma contains highly reactive species (e.g., electrons, ions and free radicals), but the bulk gas temperature of the plasma remains near room temperature during the plasma treatment. 82 The combined advantages of high reactivity and limited thermal effect have made plasma technology promising in the creation of defects in MOFs without damaging their framework structures. Yu et al. 44 used an ionized nitrogen plasma to successfully break the bonds of iron-carbon-nitrogen-nickel units in nickel-iron Prussian blue analogues, creating unconventional carbon-nitrogen vacancies (Fig. 6b). This work opens up new opportunities for producing vacancy defects in nanomaterials. Recently, we used argon plasma for the rapid introduction of missing linker defects in UiO-66 at ambient pressure and low temperature (less than 125 °C) without damaging its bulk structure. 81 The energetic and reactive species generated in the argon plasma decompose part of the linkers within UiO-66 structures, creating rich coordinatively unsaturated metal sites.Recently, plasma etching, a green and facile technology, has been developed to generate defects in MOF materials. 21,44,74,81 Plasma contains highly reactive species (e.g., electrons, ions and free radicals), but the bulk gas temperature of the plasma remains near room temperature during the plasma treatment. 82 The combined advantages of high reactivity and limited thermal effect have made plasma technology promising in the creation of defects in MOFs without damaging their framework structures.

The peak areas of pyridine adsorption at Lewis acid sites were 13.636, 5.388, and 3.398, respectively, which was consistent with the order of their catalytic performance. These results revealed that UiO-66 with more defects has more Lewis acid sites, and the catalytic activity of UiO-66 was positively correlated to the number of Lewis acid sites in MOFs. A similar finding was previously reported in UiO-type MOFs with varied amounts of missing-linker type defects based on both Zr and Hf nodes. 35 The number of defects was found to quantitatively correlate with the catalytic activity of MOFs in an acid-catalyzed epoxide ring-opening reaction. The UiO-type MOFs with a greater number of defects exhibited higher catalytic activity. However, it is important to consider the stability of defective MOF materials. For example, MOF-808 with a higher density of defect sites has shown higher activity for tert-butyl alcohol dehydration but lower stability compared to UiO-66. 120 Thus, an optimum defect density of MOFs should be considered to balance the catalyst activity and stablility.

        <p>MOFs have emerged as excellent hosts to support some active guest species in recent years. 121 Due to their high specific surface areas and hierarchical pores, defective MOFs enable reactant molecules to access the active sites even after loaded with active guest species. 117 Different kinds of guest species, such as polyoxometalates (POMs) and metal nanoparticles (NPs) have been successfully incorporated into the defective MOFs. [37][38][39]117,122,123 For example, the Keggin-type POMs confined in defective UiO-66 were prepared via a one-pot method with an in situ addition of thiourea (Fig. 11c). 37 When heated in an acidic solution, thiourea can hydrolyze to produce ammonia and hydrogen sulfide. These generated species in situ create missing linker defects or Lewis acid sites in the formation of UiO-66. The synergistic effect between defective UiO-66 and POM was elucidated in the ODS reaction. Additionally, a series of hierarchically porous precious NPs@MOFs (Pt@UiO-66-NH 2 , Pt@UiO-66, Pt@ZIF-8, and Au@ZIF-8) were successfully constructed using the thermal instability of defects around the encapsulated nanoparticles. 38 After being annealed at an appropriate temperature, the generated mesopores in these MOFs can be located around the external NPs, retaining the MOF shell for catalytic selectivity. The resulting Pt@UiO-66-NH 2 treated at 250 °C for 2 h exhibited a significantly enhanced catalytic rate and dynamic selectivity in olefin hydrogenation. Olsbye et al. 124 found that the Pt NPs encapsulated UiO-67 was active for CO 2 hydrogenation to methanol at 170 °C and 1-8 bar. The catalytic performance was correlated with the defect Zr nodes decorated on Pt NPs surface.MOFs have emerged as excellent hosts to support some active guest species in recent years. 121 Due to their high specific surface areas and hierarchical pores, defective MOFs enable reactant molecules to access the active sites even after loaded with active guest species. 117 Different kinds of guest species, such as polyoxometalates (POMs) and metal nanoparticles (NPs) have been successfully incorporated into the defective MOFs.

        <p>In addition to the introduction of NPs into the pores of defective MOF, the organic linkers or metal nodes can also be used to anchor some species as active sites. 115,116,[125][126][127] Yaghi et al. 39 synthesized a single-atom catalyst, Cu/UiO-66, through a covalent attachment of Cu atoms to the defect sites at the zirconium oxide clusters (Fig. 11d). This catalyst was highly active and stable in CO oxidation even in an O 2 -rich atmosphere and at temperature up to 350 °C. Moreover, the Cu/UiO-66 catalyst showed an excellent selectivity of about 100% in CO oxidation with H 2 -rich feed gases. Time-resolved operando spectroscopy revealed that the high activity of the catalyst was related to the formation of atomically dispersed positively charged Cu species. Chang et al. 36 developed a competitive coordination-induced defect-formation strategy to prepare hierarchically porous Cu@Al-MOF by using copper(II) tetrafluoroborate as both functional sites and etching agents. The defect-mesopores were formed within microporous Al-MOF. Meanwhile, some of the Cu(II) ions were coordinated with the pyridine nitrogen within the framework (see Fig. 6a). The Cu@Al-MOF catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic activity in the CO 2 cycloaddition with epoxides, which can be ascribed to the formation of hierarchical pore structures and the presence of both Lewis acid (doped copper sites) and base sites (unoccupied N sites).

        <p>As a class of porous materials, MOFs are considered as promising gas adsorbents due to their excellent porosity. Up to now, it has been well recognized that the defects in MOFs can alter the chemical functionalization of pores. The chemical environment of pores affects their interactions with adsorbate molecules, and consequently, the gas adsorption properties of MOFs. 129,130 As mentioned above, the defects of MOFs can provide additional active sites for the adsorption of gas molecules. High-throughput computational screening of a large experimental MOFs database identified 13 frameworks that show significantly improved methane storage capacities with linker vacancy defects. 4 The simulation results of defective candidate frameworks demonstrated that the excavation of inaccessible pores via the rational defect engineering can be an effective method to significantly enhance the gas adsorption performance of the existing MOFs. Kim et al. 5 developed an acetic acid-fragmented linker co-assembly strategy to create mesoporous defects in microporous HKUST-1. The prepared acetic acid-fragmented HKUST-1 materials enhanced methane uptake (13% higher storage capacity at 65 bar and 16% higher deliverable capacity between 5 bar and 65 bar) compared to the parent HKUST-1 due to the increased surface areas and pore volumes in the defective HKUST-1. Additionally, Jiao et al. 131 reported the confinement of a nanosized MOF CAU-1 into a functionalized mesoporous polymer. The confined nanosized CAU-1 possesses rich aluminium defects, which is confirmed by the 27 Al magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR characterization.

        <p>Structural defects of MOFs also play a vital role in gas separation. Currently, ethane-ethylene separation is an emerging topic for gas separation. Recently, Wu et al. 132 reported that machine learning could provide data-driven insight into how the defects control the performance of defective UiO-66 (UiO-66-Ds) in ethane-ethylene separation. They created a modeling library containing 425 UiO-66-Ds with a comprehensive population (in terms of concentration and distribution) of missing-linker defects. Fig. 12c gives a general view of ethane-ethylene separation performance using UiO-66-Ds. The structures in the top right of each panel exhibited a more desirable working capacity and selectivity, as well as comparable mechanical stability with respect to the ideal UiO-66. These privileged structures have relatively low concentrations of defects (missing-linker ratios of 0.2-0.3), but the defects are prone to be distributed randomly (SRO = 0.02) at 1.0 bar. The authors found that controlling the concentration of the defects was more significant in tuning the overall properties compared to the distribution of the defects.Structural defects of MOFs also play a vital role in gas separation.

        <p>The defect-induced active sites in MOFs, together with their high porosity make these materials promising in the field of decontamination. The decontamination of chemical warfare agents (CWAs) 24,[133][134][135] and the adsorption of pollutants (e.g., organoarsenic compounds 11,136 and dyes 137,138 and gas pollutants 6,7,31,83,97,139,140 ) have been widely investigated with the use of defective MOFs. Recently, zirconium-based MOFs (Zr-MOFs) with open metal sites and excellent stability have not only shown efficient uptake of CWAs but also enhanced the chemical detoxification of organophosphorus-based CWAs in a hydrolysis reaction. 24,134,141 DFT calculations indicate the mechanism of the hydrolysis reaction involves the binding of nerve agents on Zr-MOF secondary building units (SBUs) followed by the hydrolysis of the phosphoester bond (Fig. 13a). 142,143 It has been found that increasing accessibility to Zr 6 active sites enhances the rates of hydrolysis for nerve agents and their simulants. The introduction of defects in Zr-MOF generates hierarchically porous structures with additional active sites for the hydrolysis. The hierarchical pores can improve accessibility to the Zr 6 active sites. For example, Peterson et al. 134 143 predicted that the reactivity of the Zr 12 -bi-defective system in the hydrolysis of the sarin nerve agent is higher than that using other coordinatively unsaturated Zr 6 -MOFs including MOF-808, NU-1000, and defective UiO-66 from both periodic and extended cluster calculations.The defect-induced active sites in MOFs, together with their high porosity make these materials promising in the field of decontamination.

        <p>Missing linkers and/or missing clusters generate more open frameworks and thus enhance mass transfer diffusion and the adsorption. Shi et al. 94 calculated the migration energy of a uranyl ion in both perfect and defective UiO-66 using classical molecular dynamics simulations. The free energy of the uranyl ion diffusion in the ideal UiO-66 framework was about 31 kcal mol -1 . When one aromatic linker was missing to broaden the window size, the energy value dramatically decreased to 17.4 kcal mol -1 . Besides, recent studies have confirmed that defect-formation hierarchical pores provide an efficient route for the adsorption of molecules with a large size (like organic dyes). For example, defect-induced hierarchically porous UiO-66 (HP-UiO-66) shows its advantages for dye uptake with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 (R250, ca. 2.7×1.7×0.9 nm in size). 53 Upon soaking HP-UiO-66 in a solution of R250, the color of the dye solution faded while the white powder turned blue during dye uptake. In stark contrast, the pristine UiO-66 (window size, ca. 0.6 nm) cannot uptake such a large molecule, and its color remained unchanged (Fig. 13b). Similarly, due to the size-exclusion effect constructed from the defects in the framework, high selectivity for Safranine T (ST) over Crystal Violet was observed in defective UiO-66. 144 When using defective MOFs for the adsorption of organic dyes and organoarsenic compounds, the pore size, the number of defects, and electronegativity of the defective MOFs are of great importance in determining the adsorption performance. 137,144,145 Furthermore, surface alkalinity of the defective UiO-66 has a notable effect on its selective adsorption for cationic dyes (Rhodamine B (RhB) and ST) with similar sizes. 146 Alkaline N-compounds (pyrrole, dopamine, and 2-methylimidazole) coordination was proved to simultaneously modulate pore sizes and intensify surface alkalinity of the original UiO-66 (Fig. 13c), significantly decreasing the adsorption interaction towards basic dyes. As shown in Fig. 13d, pyrrole coordinated UiO-66 (N P -UiO-66) exhibited approximately three times enhanced adsorption capacity for RhB (282 mg g -1 ) and 56 times higher selectivity for the equimolar RhB/ST binary system than that of the parent UiO-66.Missing linkers and/or missing clusters generate more open frameworks and thus enhance mass transfer diffusion and the adsorption.

        <p>MOFs have been proposed as attractive carriers of drugs and biomolecules due to their low toxicity, good clearance, and high loadings. The formation of defects in MOFs further opens a broad range of opportunities to design novel drug or biomolecule loaded MOFs. The multimodal distribution of pore size in defective MOFs can improve the access of substrates to encapsulated active molecules. 30,79,147 Teplensky et al. 148 developed a temperature treatment process to delay the release of a model drug compound calcein as well as the anticancer therapeutic alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (a-CHC), which can be attributed to the partial collapse of pores in the MOFs as a result of the increased temperature. The anticancer drug showed improved efficacy when loaded into the temperature-treated defective MOFs, although the authors did not emphasize the importance of defects in MOFs. This work shows that the defect engineering of MOFs has great potential to offer an emerging solution for the long-term controlled release of drugs. Recently, Forgan et al. 52 incorporated up to three drugs into the UiO-66 by defect-loading in a one-pot synthesis, in which multiple drugs possessing carboxylate and phosphonate-containing moieties were used as both drug molecules and modulators (Fig. 14a). These drugs were distributed throughout the MOF at defect sites by coordination to the metal clusters rather than being pore-loaded, leading to retention of crystallinity and porosity. The retained porosity was used to post-synthetically load the fourth drug 5-FU into the MOFs (Fig. 14a) to yield NPs loaded with cocktails of drugs that show enhancements in selective anticancer cytotoxicity against MCF-7 breast cancer cells in vitro.MOFs have been proposed as attractive carriers of drugs and biomolecules due to their low toxicity, good clearance, and high loadings.

The multimodal distribution of pore size in defective MOFs can improve the access of substrates to encapsulated active molecules. 30,79,147 Teplensky et al. 148 developed a temperature treatment process to delay the release of a model drug compound calcein as well as the anticancer therapeutic alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (a-CHC), which can be attributed to the partial collapse of pores in the MOFs as a result of the increased temperature. The anticancer drug showed improved efficacy when loaded into the temperature-treated defective MOFs, although the authors did not emphasize the importance of defects in MOFs. This work shows that the defect engineering of MOFs has great potential to offer an emerging solution for the long-term controlled release of drugs. Recently, Forgan et al. 52 incorporated up to three drugs into the UiO-66 by defect-loading in a one-pot synthesis, in which multiple drugs possessing carboxylate and phosphonate-containing moieties were used as both drug molecules and modulators (Fig. 14a). These drugs were distributed throughout the MOF at defect sites by coordination to the metal clusters rather than being pore-loaded, leading to retention of crystallinity and porosity. The retained porosity was used to post-synthetically load the fourth drug 5-FU into the MOFs (Fig. 14a) to yield NPs loaded with cocktails of drugs that show enhancements in selective anticancer cytotoxicity against MCF-7 breast cancer cells in vitro.</p>

        <p>Moreover, as mentioned above in Fig. 5a, the microfluidic flow synthesis method 30 was developed to produce highly active enzyme-MOF composites with a multimodal distribution of pore size induced by generated defects. The microfluidic flow-synthesized horseradish peroxidase-MOF (HRP-MOF) composites showed much higher (approximately one order of magnitude) biological activity than those prepared using a conventional bulk solution synthesis approach (see S1 vs BLK, Fig. 14b). The increased activity can be ascribed to the formation of defects in MOFs, which enhances the diffusion of substrates. Meanwhile, because of the MOFs protection of the enzymes, the HRP-MOF composites exhibited superior stabilities at high temperatures and were more resistant to protease digestion compared to their natural counterparts (Fig. 14c andd). Yang et al. 149 constructed a multifunctional MOF structure (MIL-53(Fe)) with near-infrared dye (cypate) based on the interaction between Fe 3+ and the carboxyl group of cypate molecules. This MOF material can achieve multimodal imaging and guided phototherapy. Moreover, the tumors are entirely eliminated without noticeable side effects in the precise cancer phototherapy, indicating the high efficacy and safety of this multifunctional MOF platform.Moreover, as mentioned above in Fig. 5a, the microfluidic flow synthesis method 30 was developed to produce highly active enzyme-MOF composites with a multimodal distribution of pore size induced by generated defects.

        <p>It is necessary to consider the mechanical properties or stability issue of MOFs when exposed to significant mechanical stress during industrial extrusion processes. Hence, understanding how defective MOFs respond to stress is essential to their successful commercialization.

The presence of defects in MOF-5 reduces the yield strength via inducing the nucleation of dislocations. Experimental evidence for the impact of defects on the compression of UiO-66 was reported by Dissegna et al. 19 The bulk modulus decreases with the increase of the missing linkers defect density from 3% to 26%.It is necessary to consider the mechanical properties or stability issue of MOFs when exposed to significant mechanical stress during industrial extrusion processes.

        <p>Recent works have reported that the defects in MOF materials can alter their electronic band structure. [13][14][15]23 For example, a defect engineered Zr-MOF UiO-66 was obtained by introducing a range of amino-functionalized benzoic acids as defect compensating species, featuring the band gap in the 4.1-3.3 eV range. 13 In our recent work, we used plasma etching for the rapid generation of the missing linker defects in UiO-66. 81 The concentration of the defects can be tuned by changing the etching time, while the band gap of the defective UiO-66 decreased with an increase in the number of defects (Fig. 15b). The theoretical calculations further confirm the influence of defects on the electronic structures of MOFs. De Vos et al. 15 investigated the effect of missing linker defects on the electronic structures of UiO-66 by using periodic calculations. They found that the coordination of the constituent nodes, especially the nodes with the strongest local distortions alter the electronic structure of UiO-66. It is expected that the defects provide an alternative pathway to modulate the electronic structure of MOFs and thus their photocatalytic and electrocatalytic activities. 13,23 Recently, Jiang et al. 23 demonstrated that the formation of structural defects with optimized contents is vital in determining the photocatalytic activities of Pt@UiO-66-NH 2 . As shown in Fig. 15c, the photocatalytic H 2 production rate presents a volcano-type trend with incremental contents of structural defects in UiO-66-NH 2 . The volcano-type trend of H 2 production rates shows an exactly reverse relation to the average relaxation lifetime. The faster the relaxation, the higher the efficiency. Recently, the calculation and experimental studies have demonstrated that the electrocatalytic performance of MOFs can be controlled by regulating the electronic structure of MOFs via defect engineering. Xue et al. 33 and Yu et al. 44 demonstrated that the activity of CoBDC-NF in an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) could be facilitated by tuning the electronic structure of CoBDC-NF through the creation of missing linker defects. After introducing missing linkers (Fc), CoBDC-Fc-NF shows significantly enhanced OER activity with an ultralow overpotential of 178 mV to achieve 10 mA cm -2 , which is 74 and 57 mV lower than that of CoBDC-NF and commercial RuO 2 , respectively.

        <p>Conventional characterization methods are not sufficient to fully understand the nature of defects and the relationship between defects and MOF properties.
