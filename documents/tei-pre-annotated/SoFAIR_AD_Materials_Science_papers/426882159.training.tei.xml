        <p>While the discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnets opens the door for fundamental physics and next-generation spintronics, it is technically challenging to achieve the roomtemperature ferromagnetic (FM) order in a way compatible with potential device applications. Here, we report the growth and properties of single-and few-layer CrTe 2 , a van der Waals (vdW) material, on bilayer graphene by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Intrinsic ferromagnetism with a Curie temperature (T C ) up to 300 K, an atomic magnetic moment of ~0.21 μ B /Cr and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) constant (K u ) of 4.89 × 10 5 erg/cm 3 at room temperature in these few-monolayer films have been unambiguously evidenced by superconducting quantum interference device and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism. This intrinsic ferromagnetism has also been identified by the splitting of majority and minority band dispersions with ~0.2 eV at Г point using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The FM order is preserved with the film thickness down to a monolayer (T C 200 K), benefiting from the strong PMA and weak interlayer coupling. The successful MBE growth of 2D FM CrTe 2 films with room-temperature ferromagnetism opens a new avenue for developing large-scale 2D magnet-based spintronics devices.While the discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnets opens the door for fundamental physics and next-generation spintronics, it is technically challenging to achieve the roomtemperature ferromagnetic (FM) order in a way compatible with potential device applications.

        <p>T wo-dimensional (2D) layered magnets exhibit novel phases of quantum matter with abrupt transition in the magnon density of states in atomically thin layers. In a threedimensional (3D) system, the magnon density of states are consecutive and chiefly determined by exchange interactions. Therefore, a magnetic phase transition could occur at a finite temperature. By contrast, the long-range magnetic order in 2D systems is fragile against thermal fluctuations according to the Mermin-Wagner theorem 1,2 . The magneto-anisotropy in 2D ferromagnets opens up a large spin-wave excitation gap, quenches thermal fluctuations [3][4][5][6][7][8][9] , and thus stabilizes the long-range magnetic order in 2D regime. In contrast to defect or dopant induced magnetism, the ferromagnetism occurring in a stoichiometric compound is defined as intrinsic ferromagnetism 10 .T wo-dimensional (2D) layered magnets exhibit novel phases of quantum matter with abrupt transition in the magnon density of states in atomically thin layers.

        <p>While the presence of 2D crystals with intrinsic magnetism has been well established, the intrinsic ferromagnetic (FM) order in the discovered magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials is generally fragile with a low Curie temperature (T C ). It mainly results from the enhanced spin fluctuation in reduced dimensions or the relatively weak exchange interactions. Note that the interlayer bonding strength in vdW compounds is 2-3o r d e r so fm a g n i t u d ew e a k e r than that of traditional 3D materials 4 , which leads to a low T C in the bulk form already. It motivates research efforts to enhance the robustness of 2D FM order. The first route is doping a FM host with specific elements, which normally results in a limited increase of T C but unavoidable clusters and/or disorders from dopants 11,12 . The second one is constructing heterostructures with FM (or ferrimagnetic) metals (or insulators), in which the FM order can be enhanced by proximity effects 13,14 . For instance, the (Fe 3 GeTe 2 / MnTe) 3 superlattices possess an enhanced coercive field as a result of the proximity effect 12 . However, the penetration depth of proximity effect is usually very small (&lt;5 nm), hindering an effective manipulation of magnetic order. The third method is doping 2D magnets with electrons via electrolyte gating, and thereby modulating the T C of ferromagnetism. For example, the T C of an atomically thin Fe 3 GeTe 2 flake is successfully raised to even room temperature 15 . Nevertheless, particular device geometry and gating are required by this means. Apart from the issues mentioned above, most of the 2D magnetic materials reported so far are thin flakes exfoliated from bulk with typical size of several micrometers, which greatly limits the practical applications of those 2D magnets in spintronics. Therefore, there is a pressing need for the realization of stoichiometric 2D materials with intrinsic robust ferromagnetism (e.g., high T C and strong perpendicular anisotropy) and, importantly, compatibility with largescale solid-state device applications.While the presence of 2D crystals with intrinsic magnetism has been well established, the intrinsic ferromagnetic (FM) order in the discovered magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials is generally fragile with a low Curie temperature (T C ).

        <p>Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth is significant as it provides the opportunity to obtain nominally stoichiometric single-crystalline films, explore the role of physical dimensionality as well as fabricate heterostructures and superlattices in a way compatible with conventional microelectronics techniques. One remarkable work is the strong FM order in ML VSe 2 epitaxial film with in-plane easy axis and a large magnetic moment (~15 μ B /V) persisting to even above room temperature, as characterized by magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) 16 . However, according to the theoretical calculations, the magnetic moment of ML VSe 2 mostly comes from V ions with an atomic value of ~0.6 μ B 17 , which is completely contradictory to the experimentally observed large magnetic moment 16 , raising doubts about this presumed FM phase. Most recently, Wong et al. has provided the evidence of spin frustration with absence of a long-range magnetic order in ML VSe 2 films from complementary temperature-and fielddependent susceptibility measurements 18 , in stark contrast to the previous study. Moreover, the electronic structure and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements of ML VSe 2 conducted by Feng et al. reveal no signatures of FM order 19 . These studies suggest that the existence of 2D FM order in VSe 2 remains to be further confirmed. Therefore, layer-controlled growth of stoichiometric large-scale 2D FM films with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and direct proof for the intrinsic ferromagnetism by unambiguous techniques would be mandatory. Notably, an above-room-temperature T C has been reported in 1T-CrTe 2 in its bulk form 20 . Very recently, aboveroom-temperature ferromagnetism has been observed in the exfoliated thin flakes of CrTe 2 (10 nm, or ~17 ML) 21,22 . Their properties were found to be rather similar to that of the bulk with in-plane magnetic anisotropy, but with enhanced coercivity compared with its bulk counterpart.

        <p>In this work, we succeed in synthesizing mono-and few-layer CrTe 2 films by MBE and observed intrinsic long-range 2D ferromagnetism. The robust ferromagnetism and strong PMA of CrTe 2 films persist up to 300 K, as evidenced by both superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) and XMCD characterizations. In addition, the splitting of the majority and minority bands (~0.2 eV at Г point) with distinct photon-energy responses has been observed by in-situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements, suggesting the magnetic band structure of CrTe 2 with spin-splitting. Furthermore, the CrTe 2 thin films retain a robust ferromagnetism with high T C down to a ML, indicating a weak dimensionality effect. These results establish CrTe 2 ultrathin films as a promising 2D ferromagnet for exotic low-dimensional spintronics applications.In this work, we succeed in synthesizing mono-and few-layer CrTe 2 films by MBE and observed intrinsic long-range 2D ferromagnetism.

        <p>CrTe 2 is a layered trigonal crystal structure with a unit cell of a hexagonal Cr layer sandwiched between Te layers, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1a. In our experiment, a bilayer graphene on SiC substrate was used to support a layer-by-layer growth of CrTe 2 films. The optical image of a single-crystal CrTe 2 film with large size (~4 mm × 5 mm) is shown in the inset of Fig. 1b. The microscopic topography taken from the surface of a few-layer CrTe 2 film by in-situ scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) shows atomically flat terrace (Fig. 1b). Figure 1c exhibits the step height between adjacent layers with a uniform value of 6.14 Å, which is consistent with the thickness of the unit cell of CrTe 2 crystal in 1T phase. One of the atomic resolution image taken by STM on the same sample is presented in Fig. 1e, showing the hexagonal lattice structure. The lattice constant obtained from the line profile in Fig. 1f is 3.81 Å, which is very close to the corresponding bulk CrTe 2 lattice parameter (3.79 Å) 20 . STM measurements carried out on several CrTe 2 thin films with different thicknesses (mono-to few-layer) show similar terraces, indicating the layer-by-layer growth mode and homogeneously wellstructured thin films (see Supplementary Fig. 1).CrTe 2 is a layered trigonal crystal structure with a unit cell of a hexagonal Cr layer sandwiched between Te layers, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1a.

        <p>There are various stable stoichiometries reported for chromium chalcogenides [e.g., CrTe 23,24 ,C r 2 Te 3 25,26 , and Cr 5 Te 8 27,28 ] depending on the Cr vacancies that occur in intercalation. However, none of them belongs to layered compounds with interlayer vdW gap, except for CrTe 2 . The layered surface morphology with a uniform step height characterized by STM suggests that the films are in a single phase with vdW gap. The atomic-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images show the p 3a × a arrangement, revealing that CrTe 2 thin films correspond to the 1T phase with an octahedral (O h ) symmetry (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Both TEM and STM characterizations manifest the epitaxial nature and crystallographic orientation of as-grown CrTe 2 films. A typical X-ray diffraction (XRD) 2θ-ω scan was employed to further identify the crystal structure (Fig. 1d). The diffraction pattern with perpendicular constant c = 6.13 Å is matched to the (001) crystal planes of 1T-type hexagonal structure explored experimentally (a = 3.79 Å, c = 6.10 Å) 20 , rather than those of the 2H phase (a = 3.49 Å, c = 13.64 Å) 29 . We note that the magnetic exchange coupling is sensitive to the lattice parameters. For example, bulk 1T-CrSe 2 with lattice constants of a = 3.39 Å and c = 5.92 Å shows an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order 30 , in contrast to the FM phase in CrTe 2 . With STM, TEM, and XRD characterizations, the formation of CrTe 2 films with 1T phase and their single-crystalline nature has been confirmed. The reflectivity curves show Laue fringes, attesting to the structural coherence of the film. The chemical states and band structure of the assynthesized samples were determined by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and ARPES as included in the following part, respectively, which further identify the metallic 1T phase in these few-layer CrTe 2 films.There are various stable stoichiometries reported for chromium chalcogenides [e.g., CrTe 23,24 ,C r 2 Te 3 25,26 , and Cr 5 Te 8 27,28 ] depending on the Cr vacancies that occur in intercalation.

        <p>Magnetic properties of CrTe 2 thin films with both in-plane and out-of-plane configurations were examined by SQUID, as shown in Fig. 2. The temperature dependent magnetization (M-T) curves of CrTe 2 thin films with different thicknesses under an out-of-plane magnetic field of 1000 Oe were measured, as shown in Fig. 2a. It shows a general trend of decreasing with the increase of temperature, demonstrating a FM nature. It indicates that the T C is close to the room temperature with the specific values depending on the thickness. The magnetization of 7 ML CrTe 2 film is still observable at 300 K, indicating the FM order at room temperature. The magnetization curve exhibits a long "tail" near T C, which is commonly observed in ferromagnets 4,11,31 . It can be explained by a positive-feedback mean-field modification of the classical Brillouin magnetization theory 32 .Magnetic properties of CrTe 2 thin films with both in-plane and out-of-plane configurations were examined by SQUID, as shown in Fig. 2.

        <p>The magnetization-magnetic field (M-H) hysteresis loops acquired from the 7 ML CrTe 2 film at different temperatures are included in Fig. 2b andc. The sharp distinction between out-of-plane (Fig. 2b) and in-plane (Fig. 2c) M-H loops demonstrates a strong out-of-plane anisotropy of the magnetization with a large PMA constant (K u ¼ H k M s 2 ) of 5.63 × 10 6 erg/cm 3 at 20 K. The K u in CrTe 2 thin films is comparable to the typical PMA systems such as Co/Pd and Co/Pt (see Supplementary Table 1) [33][34][35][36] , which is vital for obtaining 2D FM order and is also considerably desirable for vdW heterostructures-based spintronics. The film also exhibits rather large coercivities (e.g., ~1000 Oe at 20 K), indicative of a hard magnetic phase. Well-defined hysteresis loops are observed at elevated temperatures up to 300 K (Fig. 2d) with the easy axis along the out-of-plane direction and hard axis along the in-plane one. The existence of PMA in the ultrathin 7 ML film is confirmed, supporting the FM order at room temperature. The in-plane magnetic hysteresis loops, similar to those reported in the FM vdW Cr 2 Ge 2 Te 6 thin films 37 and typical PMA systems such as Mn 2.5 Ga 38 and Co/Pt 39 , can be attributed to the shape anisotropy favoring in-plane easy axis for thin films 40,41 . Control experiments on the field dependent magnetization of SiC/graphene substrate show a typical diamagnetic behavior (see Supplementary Fig. 4). Therefore, the possibility of magnetic contribution from magnetic impurities in the substrate can be ruled out. In order to clarify the thickness dependence of the magnetic properties, we have measured the field dependent magnetization curves of 3 ML and 5 ML CrTe 2 thin films under out-of-plane and in-plane configuration (Supplementary Fig. 5). The squarish FM hysteresis loops in the out-of-plane magnetic field suggest the robust FM order with the easy axis perpendicular to the thin films, which is essential for the applications of FM devices. Compared with other 2D magnets from literature 3,4,42,43 , the CrTe 2 films perform a relatively high T C (above room temperature) and strong magnetic anisotropy with a few atomic layers. Notably, a large K u (4.89 × 10 5 erg/cm 3 ) is maintained at 300 K, comparable to the value of bulk CrGeTe 3 at 1.8 K (4.7 × 10 5 erg/cm 3 ) 44 . The strong PMA in CrTe 2 few-layer films is different from the in-plane magnetic anisotropy observed in bulk CrTe 2 20 and exfoliated flakes (thicker than 10 nm) 21 . Here, the thickness dependent magnetic anisotropy suggests that the reduced symmetry at the interface plays an important role in determining the PMA in CrTe 2 thin films 45 . As the magnetic film thickness approaches a few nm, the interfacial magnetism and inversion symmetry breaking give rise to the PMA 46 . This is a consequence of magneto-crystalline anisotropy from spin-orbit interactions, which apparently have a stronger effect in the more anisotropic film limit 33,41,45 . In addition, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it has been found that the FM Cr-Cr intrasublattice exchange interactions dominate in CrTe 2 thin films, and the total energy minima is at perpendicular direction 47 . In general, the magnetic moments of CrTe 2 thin films are aligned in the perpendicular direction, due to the magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the anisotropy of exchange interactions.The magnetization-magnetic field (M-H) hysteresis loops acquired from the 7 ML CrTe 2 film at different temperatures are included in Fig. 2b andc.

        <p>To examine the local electronic character and magnetic ground states of CrTe 2 films, XAS and XMCD measurements at the Cr L 2,3 absorption edges were performed, as schematically shown in Fig. 3a. This element-specific magnetic characterization technique can also exclude any possible magnetic impurities. The XAS spectra of Cr present multiplet structures around photon energies of 575 eV and 584 eV (Fig. 3b), which stem from the excitations from Cr 2p 3/2 and Cr 2p 1/2 core levels, respectively. A small peak (~2 eV away from L 3 peak of Cr) marked with the black arrow comes from Te 5d 5/2 core level, which slightly overlaps with the peak of Cr 2p 3/2 with almost no magnetic contribution 48 . A small peak at the higher energy side (marked with orange arrow) of the main feature in Fig. 3b is related to the distribution of atomic multiplet. Due to the O h coordination, the 3d orbitals of Cr split into e g and t 2g states with energy separation of nominal 10 Dq. The t 2g states are lower in energy than the e g states. In this case, the Cr 3+ (d 3 ) configuration with half-filled t 2g states causes the reduction of free energy 49 , which is in good agreement with the reported theoretical value of magnetic moment, 3 μ B /Cr atom 50 . The observed XAS spectral line shape is in line with that of spinel Cu(Cr,Ti) 2 Se 4 polycrystals with trivalent Cr cations on O h sites 51 , further providing a spectroscopic fingerprint of 1T-type CrTe 2 with predominately Cr 3+ cations. In this case, approximately three electrons are removed from the Cr atoms, and distributed over the Te.To examine the local electronic character and magnetic ground states of CrTe 2 films, XAS and XMCD measurements at the Cr L 2,3 absorption edges were performed, as schematically shown in Fig. 3a.

The XAS spectra of Cr present multiplet structures around photon energies of 575 eV and 584 eV (Fig. 3b), which stem from the excitations from Cr 2p 3/2 and Cr 2p 1/2 core levels, respectively. A small peak (~2 eV away from L 3 peak of Cr) marked with the black arrow comes from Te 5d 5/2 core level, which slightly overlaps with the peak of Cr 2p 3/2 with almost no magnetic contribution 48 . A small peak at the higher energy side (marked with orange arrow) of the main feature in Fig. 3b is related to the distribution of atomic multiplet. Due to the O h coordination, the 3d orbitals of Cr split into e g and t 2g states with energy separation of nominal 10 Dq. The t 2g states are lower in energy than the e g states. In this case, the Cr 3+ (d 3 ) configuration with half-filled t 2g states causes the reduction of free energy 49 , which is in good agreement with the reported theoretical value of magnetic moment, 3 μ B /Cr atom 50 . The observed XAS spectral line shape is in line with that of spinel Cu(Cr,Ti) 2 Se 4 polycrystals with trivalent Cr cations on O h sites 51 , further providing a spectroscopic fingerprint of 1T-type CrTe 2 with predominately Cr 3+ cations. In this case, approximately three electrons are removed from the Cr atoms, and distributed over the Te.</p>
        <p>The Cr L 2,3 XMCD spectra in the bottom panel of Fig. 3b highlight the emergence of intrinsic ferromagnetism from Cr atoms. XMCD and XAS measurements were repeated at elevated temperatures, and the dichroism of 7 ML thin film at Cr L 3 edge is evident up to 300 K. The characteristic peaks in the spectra remain at the same energy as the temperature rises, despite the attenuation of intensity.

        <p>The calculated m s and m l from 5 to 300 K are summarized in Fig. 3d. The derived m s demonstrates a Curie-like behavior. A remarkably large value of m s (2.85 ± 0.10 μ B /Cr) is found at 5 K. The m s retains a sizable value of 0.82 ± 0.10 μ B /Cr at 250 K and drops to 0.21 ± 0.05 μ B /atom at 300 K, confirming a FM phase transition near this temperature. On the other hand, m l is relatively small of around 0.08 ± 0.05 μ B /atom, consistent with a halffilled t 2g level in O h crystal field of 1T-CrTe 2 . The m l plays an important role in the magneto-crystalline anisotropy and the perpendicular orientation of the moments that underlies the FM order in this 2D system. The atomic magnetic moment of CrTe 2 is determined to be ~3 μ B /atom. The observed FM behavior cannot be attributed to the Cr clusters, since bulk Cr is AFM and therefore would give a zero XMCD intensity.The calculated m s and m l from 5 to 300 K are summarized in Fig. 3d.

        <p>The magnetic response of 1 ML CrTe 2 film is worth exploring. It is difficult to detect magnetization in such ultrathin films by SQUID, since the magnetic signal of 1 ML CrTe 2 is too weak compared with an overwhelmingly larger background signal from the substrate and beyond the resolution of SQUID. Therefore, we did element-specific XMCD characterization of 1 ML CrTe 2 film (Fig. 4a). There is a noticeable difference in the XAS spectra between left-and right-handed circularly polarized setups (Fig. 4b). Although the dichroism is small compared with 7 ML sample, the clear XMCD signals appear near the absorption peaks. It suggests that the intrinsic ferromagnetism of 1 ML CrTe 2 film originates from the spin polarization of Cr 3d electrons. Accurate calculation of the magnetic moment remains a challenge since the contribution of Te capping layer to the XAS spectra is so large for 1 ML sample. The XMCD percentage increases with the reduced temperature (Fig. 4c), in line with a typical FM behavior. The nonzero XMCD percentage persists when temperature approaches 200 K and disappears above 250 K, indicating that 1 ML CrTe 2 has a T C of ~200 K. The T C has been obtained by using a critical power-law function α(1-T/T C ) β to fit M-T curves without the inclusion of the paramagnetic tail 42 . In order to investigate the dimensionality effect of the ferromagnetism in CrTe 2 stemming from thermal fluctuation, we plot the thickness dependent T C obtained from XMCD and SQUID measurements in Fig. 4d. The T C of CrTe 2 decreases mildly as the film thickness is reduced, in contrast to the other known 2D magnets such as Cr 2 Ge 2 Te 6 4 and Fe 3 GeTe 2 15 (Supplementary Fig. 10). The high T C in the 2D limit demonstrates the robustness of ferromagnetism in the epitaxial CrTe 2 thin films.The magnetic response of 1 ML CrTe 2 film is worth exploring.

        <p>The origin of the band dispersions has been investigated by first-principle DFT calculations based on CrTe 2 slab 18 . The mean free path of photoelectrons excited by photons of 21.2 eV and 40.8 eV is between 0.5 and 1 nm. Therefore, to compare with the experimental spectra, we simulated the band structure with a surface weight of each Bloch wavefunction. The higher intensity in the image means greater weight of wavefunction near the slab surface. Figure 4b shows the calculated spin-polarized band structure, with the majority and minority spin bands plotted in blue and red, respectively. Both magnetization and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) are taken into account in the calculation, and the magnetic moments are set along out-of-plane direction. According to the orbital and surface projection analysis of the band structure, the metallicity is a consequence of the hybridization of Te-5p and Cr-3d orbitals crossing the Fermi level at the center of the Brillouin zone (see Supplementary Fig. 13), which is confirmed by the calculated density of states (see Supplementary Fig. 14). The hybridization of Te and Cr states was also verified in previous DFT calculations 20 .

        <p>To compare experiment and theory in greater detail, the dispersion of hole pockets detected by different photon energies is plotted in Fig. 5c andd. Note that the two hole pockets near the Fermi level in Fig. 5c are mainly from the majority bands. Interestingly, the minority hole pocket shows up in the spectrum taken at hv = 40.8 eV (Fig. 5d) while the majority ones disappear. It suggests the emission from the minority spin pockets was suppressed in the measurement at hv = 21.2 eV as a consequence of matrix element effect 58 . The band dispersion can be traced by fitting the peak position in the momentum distribution curves (MDC), as marked by blue and red dashed lines in Fig. 5ca n dd , respectively. Combining the band structure near Fermi energy (E F ) taken by He Iα and He IIα photons together, as shown in Fig. 5e, the electronic structure is clearly metallic in both the majority and minority spin channels, and agrees well with DFT calculations. Relatively small renormalizations are needed to match with ARPES results, indicating moderate-to-weak correlations. The experimental band structure of CrTe 2 is in sharp contrast with the band structure calculated without the inclusion of spin polarization (Supplementary Fig. 15), where hole pockets near E F are degenerate at Г point as in the cases of VTe 2 59 and VSe 2 18,19 . There are no exchange splitting of band dispersion in MBE grown VSe 2 films, indicating the absence of ferromagnetism 18,19 .B y contrast, the splitting of majority and minority bands (~0.2 eV at Г point) in CrTe 2 films corroborates the FM ground state, which highlights the unique interplay of ferromagnetism and electronic structure in CrTe 2 . In addition, the calculated magnetic moment of Cr is 2.89 μ B /atom, in good agreement with the SQUID and XMCD measurements. For a comparison with the ARPES spectra, we also calculated the electronic band structure of 2H-CrTe 2 , which are different from those observed in the ARPES spectra and the calculated 1T-CrTe 2 band structure in the low-energy bands (see Supplementary Fig. 17). Another significant difference between 1T and 2H phase is that the 1T-CrTe 2 exhibits a FM ground state along c-axis, while the 2H-CrTe 2 is PM as a result of the fully occupied d z 2 orbital of tetravalent Cr.

        <p>We have further studied the thickness dependence of hole pocket features. The evolution of the band structure for the films with a thickness ranging from 1 ML to 15 ML is shown in Fig. 5f. For the 1 ML film, there are two parabolic bands with a maximum above and below the Fermi level, respectively. When film thickness increases to 2 ML, one of the parabolic band overlaps with another one near the Fermi level, sharing similar feature with the case of few-layer ZrTe 2 57 and HfTe 2 60 . With further increasing the film thickness, the Fermi level moves towards the valence band with the band shape invariant. To understand the thicknessdependent electronic structure, we carried out first-principles calculations of 1T-CrTe 2 with different thicknesses (see Supplementary Fig. 18). There is an excellent agreement between our experiment and theory. In particular, the hole-like band near E F and a relatively flat Cr 3d orbital band are similar to that of calculated 1T-CrTe 2 with the inclusion of spin polarization. For the 1 ML film, the two parabolic hole pockets are well reproduced by the majority spin projections of the bands, which highlights the FM nature. These results demonstrate that the epitaxial 1 T structure and ferromagnetism have been established since 1 ML deposition, in line with the corresponding STM images.

The epitaxial CrTe 2 ultrathin films with thickness up to 7 ML possess room-temperature intrinsic ferromagnetism, large magnetic moments (~3 μ B /atom), strong perpendicular anisotropy and magnetic spin-split band structure. The high T C is preserved with the thickness down to one ML due to the strong magnetic anisotropy and the weak interlayer coupling. The FM CrTe 2 films can be employed as a spin injector when hybridized with other 2D materials such as topological insulator and topological semimetals for exploring novel spin physics.
