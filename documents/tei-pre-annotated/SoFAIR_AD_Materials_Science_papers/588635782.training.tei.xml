        <p>A malignant tumour is an unusual state in which a cluster of cells ignore the normal functional rules of the cell distribution, and develop in an uncontrolled way [1]. Malignant cells don't react to the signs that stimulate the normal cell cycle as they have a degree of self-adequacy, which leads to the uncontrolled growth and production of altered cells [38]. If the multiplication of cancerous cells persists, it can be lethal. 90% of fatalities associated with cancers are a consequence of the spread of cancer cells to other tissues, known also as metastasis [2]. Cancer is one of the principal causes of death globally, with an expected 7.6 million persons lost their lives every year and accounting for 13% of all demises. Mortality related to cancer is anticipated to increase to 13.1 million by the year 2030 [3].A malignant tumour is an unusual state in which a cluster of cells ignore the normal functional rules of the cell distribution, and develop in an uncontrolled way [1].

        <p>Cancer is not only an illness, but it includes a huge number of diseases with every organ or system growing a different set of ailments [4,5]. About 30% of cancer associated death are related to smoking, additional lifestyle factors [6], or dietetic practices. To some extends, several types of cancers are avoidable by modifying unhealthy lifestyle habits.

        <p>One of the prospective essential advantages of nanotechnology for the treatment of carcinoma is tumour targeting [8]. Europe reports 23.4% of the carcinoma cases worldwide and 20.3% of the carcinoma fatalities, though it has only 9.0% of the global population. The United States of America have 13.3% of the international populace and account for 2% of occurrence and 14.4% of cancer related deaths globally. In comparison with other regions of the world, the ratios of deaths caused by metastasis cancer in Africa and Asia (7.3% and 57.3% respectively) are more than the percentages of incident cases (5.8% and 48.4% correspondingly), since these areas have a raised incidence of certain types of cancer-related with the worst prognosis and elevated rates of death, in addition to restricted access to well-timed identification and management. Some of the cancers, such as lung cancer, breast cancer in females, and colorectal carcinomas, are the top 3 types of cancers in terms of frequency. They are categorized among the top 5 in terms of death (first, fifth, and second, respectively). Collectively, these 3 types of cancer are accountable for 1/3 rd of the cancer prevalence and death burden worldwide. Carcinomas of the lungs and breast are the most important types globally in expressions of the quantities of novel cases; for each of these types, around 2.1 million case detections are approximated in 2018, contributing about 11.6% of the overall cancer frequency burden. Colorectal carcinoma (1.8 million cases) is the 3rd most frequently identified cancer [9], carcinoma of the prostate is the 4th (1.3 million cases), and gastric carcinoma is the 5 th (1.0 million cases, 5.7%). Pulmonary carcinoma is the most frequently identified cancer in males, i.e., 14.5% of the overall cases in males and 8.4% in females along with the principal root of death by cancer in males 22%, which is about 1 in five of all cancer mortalities. In men, this is chased by CA prostate 13.5% and colorectal carcinoma 10.9% for frequency and liver carcinoma 10.2% and gastric carcinoma 9.5% for death. Carcinoma of the breast is the most frequently identified cancer in women [10] and cancer is the most widespread in 154 out of the one hundred and eighty-five countries included in GLOBOCAN 2018 [42]. Carcinoma of the breast is also the principal cause of cancer demise in women i.e., 15%, followed by pulmonary carcinoma 13.8% and colorectal carcinoma 9.5%, which are also the 3 rd and 2 nd most widespread types of cancer, correspondingly; CA Cervix ranks 4 th for both frequency (6.6%) and death (7.5%) [43]. Statistics show that there is a continuing need to make progress in target drug delivery systems in cancer therapy because oral administration of anticancer drugs is extremely difficult due to physiological barriers in the gastrointestinal tract such as poor solubility and low permeability of the intestinal membrane.One of the prospective essential advantages of nanotechnology for the treatment of carcinoma is tumour targeting [8].

        <p>A good example is Docetaxel, a powerful anticarcinogenic medicine used in the management of prostate cancer, breast carcinoma, non-small-cell pulmonary carcinoma, and stomach adenocarcinomas. Docetaxel is considered one of the leading anticancer medicines in clinical utilization [44]. Studies showed that the highest concentration of drugs in plasma obtained after nanoparticle form administration was fourfold higher than that of the Docetaxel solution. Moreover, the highest concentration of plasma was achieved afterwards for the nanoparticle formulation contrasted to the free drug, proposing a persistent-release profile. The prolonged-releasing property of the nanoparticles amplified the distribution time of the drug, so the encapsulation of drugs into the nanoparticles might have also a protective role against drug degradation [45]. Docetaxel nanoparticles considerably restrained the growth of the tumour. Studies showed that the nanocrystals accomplished maximum effectiveness of medicine loading, with a small number of toxic effects in contrast with the presently commercially accessible Cremophor-filled formulations following oral experience [46].A good example is Docetaxel, a powerful anticarcinogenic medicine used in the management of prostate cancer, breast carcinoma, non-small-cell pulmonary carcinoma, and stomach adenocarcinomas.

        <p>The capacity to distinguish carcinogenic cells from non-carcinogenic and to discriminatingly eliminate malignant cells is essential for the aim of nanotechnology. In the case of the oral Paclitaxel administration, studies showed that the concentrations of the drug in plasma were two times higher for the nanoparticles compared with the commercially available Paclitaxel [47].The capacity to distinguish carcinogenic cells from non-carcinogenic and to discriminatingly eliminate malignant cells is essential for the aim of nanotechnology.

        <p>Chitosan is the denomination given to a range of polymers obtained from chitin, a natural polysaccharide composed of β-(1,4)-linked N-acetyl glucosamine units [19,20]. The most common sources of chitin include fungi and the exoskeleton of crustaceans and insects.Chitosan is the denomination given to a range of polymers obtained from chitin, a natural polysaccharide composed of β-(1,4)-linked N-acetyl glucosamine units [19,20]. The most common sources of chitin include fungi and the exoskeleton of crustaceans and insects.</p>
        <p>The transformation of chitin into chitosan is achieved by deacetylation. The process can be either chemical, using a strong solution of sodium hydroxide (25-50%) and high temperature (90-120 ºC), or biochemical, using deacetylases. (Fig. 1).The transformation of chitin into chitosan is achieved by deacetylation. The process can be either chemical, using a strong solution of sodium hydroxide (25-50%) and high temperature (90-120 ºC), or biochemical, using deacetylases. (Fig. 1).</p>
        <p>According to the conditions used in the deacetylation reaction, the resulting chitosan polymers will have different lengths, and also different remaining acetyl residues. This translates into a large range of molecular weights, from 300 to over 1000 kD. Moreover, the degree of acetylation of chitosan, ranging from 5 to 70% [21], has a strong influence on physicochemical properties such as viscosity and solubility [22]. Chitosan, while being insoluble in water at neutral pH, can dissolve in dilute acids owing to the protonation of its free amine groups. Cationic chitosan is thus soluble in dilute acetic, formic, citric, and other acids [23], in direct correlation to its deacetylation degree.According to the conditions used in the deacetylation reaction, the resulting chitosan polymers will have different lengths, and also different remaining acetyl residues.

        <p>The amine groups of chitosan also influence a large variety of its pharmaceutical and biomedical properties, including mucoadhesion, permeation enhancement, transfection, and in situ gelation [24,25]. Adding to the broad range of bioactive features, chitosan benefits from good biotolerability, low immunogenicity, and facile biodegradation in vivo [25].The amine groups of chitosan also influence a large variety of its pharmaceutical and biomedical properties, including mucoadhesion, permeation enhancement, transfection, and in situ gelation [24,25].

        <p>The pharmaceutical use of chitosan requires a careful choice of the material. Given the wide diversity of chitosan polymers available, choosing the right molecular weight, degree of acetylation, and purity grade may appear to be a troublesome task. Some guidelines can be found in the European (6 th edition) and United States (29 th edition) Pharmacopoeias [26,27], namely regarding purity and degree of acetylation, albeit the later has a rather broad tolerance interval (Table 1). The most frequent impurities present in chitosan are ash, heavy metals, and proteins. Proteins are relevant to biological activity because they can bring immunogenicity issues. High ash and residual protein content may hamper dissolution and cause difficulties in the preparation of chitosan-based drug delivery systems [28].The pharmaceutical use of chitosan requires a careful choice of the material.

        <p>The stability of chitosan is also a very important factor to consider when aiming at pharmaceutical applications. Chitosan is very sensitive to environmental conditions, especially humidity, due to its high hygroscopy. Water retention on chitosan occurs by hydrogen bonding, and it was reported to change its mechanical properties [29] and cause a partial loss of its mucoadhesive properties [30]. Thermal degradation of chitosan solutions was also observed, both at ambient temperature and at 60ºC [31,32]. For these reasons, storage at low temperatures (2-8 ºC) in a dry ambient is recommended.The stability of chitosan is also a very important factor to consider when aiming at pharmaceutical applications.

        <p>Chitosan-based nanoparticles can be used for the delivery of active ingredients, such as drugs or natural products, by diverse routes of administration such as oral and parenteral delivery [33,34]. Chitosan nanoparticles are also particularly suitable for local delivery at the dermis and the mucosa, namely in the nasal, buccal, pulmonary and rectal routes, owing to the mucoadhesive properties and permeability-enhancing action of chitosan [33][34][35]. Chitosan nanoparticles combine the natural properties of the polymer with tuneable size and the possibility of surface modification according to custom needs, being thus a very promising and versatile strategy to overcome the bioavailability and stability issues of most active ingredients [33].Chitosan-based nanoparticles can be used for the delivery of active ingredients, such as drugs or natural products, by diverse routes of administration such as oral and parenteral delivery [33,34].

        <p>Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) have been utilized for magnetic resonance imaging of lymph nodes after uptake of macrophage, which will possibly help discover any spreadable cancerous disease [60,61]. Currently, a novel approach for the bioequivalence assembly of nanoparticles with mediators of imaging was illustrated [62]. In principle, extremely particular imaging of little quantities of malevolent cells could be accomplished by connecting a targeting agent, for instance, a monoclonal antibody, with Gd 3+ -chelates to influence magnetic resonance (MR) relaxivity or combining with other imaging investigations. Sensitivity is a challenging issue of research in imaging. One prospective approach is to intensify the signal in the part of interest by conveying the appropriate enzyme. For instance, horseradish peroxidase has been transported to tumours of xenograft via conjugation to tumour-specific monoclonal antibodies, and this has been utilized to oligomerize MR-definite ligands to attain an improved signal for imaging and detection of tumour [63]. Magnetic nanoparticles can be utilized for both advanced magnetic resonance imaging and applications of hyperthermia for progressive cancer management [63]. Iron oxide nanoparticles can be combined with methotrexate [64], paclitaxel [65], or other anticarcinogenic drugs [66] for theranostic (therapeutic and diagnostic) applications. Nanoparticles of gold, quantum dots, and carbon nanotubes have also been customized and used for possible theranostic applications [67]. The manufacturing of medicine at the nanoscale level has been considered broadly. It is undoubtedly, the most progressive technology in the field of Np applications as of its possible benefits for instance the likelihood to alter properties such as bioavailability, solubility, diffusivity, medicine releasing profiles, and immunogenicity. This can therefore lead to the progress and advancement of suitable administration ways, minimum toxicity, improved bio delivery, a small number of side effects, and expanded life cycle of drug [51]. Target transport is another significant part that uses nanomaterials as drug delivery systems and is classified into active and passive transport. In active positioning, moieties, for example peptides and antibodies are combined with system of drug delivery to connect them to the structures of receptor articulated at the target location. In passive targeting, the prepared carrier compound of drug moves in the course of the blood flow. It is driven to the site of object by attraction or binding affected by properties like temperature, pH, shape and molecular site. The chief targets in the human body are the receptors present on the cell membranes, antigens or proteins and lipid contents of the cell membrane and the surfaces [68].Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) have been utilized for magnetic resonance imaging of lymph nodes after uptake of macrophage, which will possibly help discover any spreadable cancerous disease [60,61].

        <p>Hyaluronic acid is one more biopolymeric material. This is a bio-friendly, negatively stimulated glycosaminoglycan, and is one of the most important components of the extracellular matrix [72,73]. Hyaluronic acid can combine with the CD44 glycoprotein receptor, which is frequently over-expressive in a variety of carcinogenic cells, using the receptor connecting interrelation. Therefore, hyaluronic acid-altered nanoparticles are fascinating for their utilization in the diagnosis and treatment of carcinoma [74][75][76]. The perspective of this procedure was examined in both the live cells and in the laboratory. Amplified uptake of nanoparticles by cancer cells was detected by magnetic resonance imaging when an outer magnetic field was utilized [77].

However, many other factors contribute to controlling solution properties such as the distribution and number of acetyl groups along the chains, pH, the ionic concentration, the conditions of isolation and drying [154].</p>
        <p>Additionally, chitosan presents mucoadhesive and absorption-enhancing properties. The mucoadhesive nature of chitosan depends on electrostatic interaction between the positive charge on the ionizable protonated amine group and the negative charge on the mucosal surfaces. These interactions trigger a reversible structural reorganization in the protein-associated tight junctions which opens the tight junctions between cells, allowing the drug to cross the mucosal cells [155]. Mucoadhesion also extends the contact of the drug with the mucosal layer, and allow site-specific administration, in particular in those body site presenting specific mucosal surfaces such as buccal and nasal cavities. Again, many factors can influence mucoadhesive properties such as the molecular weight, the flexibility of the chitosan chain, the electrostatic interaction, the availability of hydrogen bond formation, and the capacity of spreading into the mucus due to surface energy properties [156].Additionally, chitosan presents mucoadhesive and absorption-enhancing properties.

        <p>Also, nanosized formulations are characterized by a large surface to volume ratios, which intensely strengthen the intrinsic properties of chitosan. Nanostructure of appropriate size and surface charge can improve drug penetration thus improving uptake through the cell membrane. Moreover, nanocarriers could protect bioactive agents against high pH and/or metabolic degradation, thus prolonging the drug life span. Therefore, nanosized carriers could effectively modulate pharmacokinetics, enhancing drug efficacy beside reduced toxicity [157] and offer the possibility to deliver bioactive agents in a controlled and, sometimes, site-specific manner.Also, nanosized formulations are characterized by a large surface to volume ratios, which intensely strengthen the intrinsic properties of chitosan.

        <p>However, there are several challenges in the use of drug nanocarriers such as low drug encapsulation, premature release, poor permeability and instability, which could finally affect drug bioavailability.However, there are several challenges in the use of drug nanocarriers such as low drug encapsulation, premature release, poor permeability and instability, which could finally affect drug bioavailability.</p>
        <p>In particular, stability represents one of the most important factors regulating the efficiency of drug delivery systems, especially in the case of nanoparticles [158]. As regards chitosan nanocarriers, instability could depend on degradation by digestive enzymes and pH variation throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Additionally, a surface charge strongly influences stability and distribution and limits there in vitro and in vivo application. Indeed, although positively charged particles are strongly attracted by negatively charged cell membranes leading to an efficient internalization in the cells, the interaction with serum components could lead to severe aggregation followed by a fast clearance from the circulatory system [159]. Therefore, many attempts of tailoring the chitosan nanoparticles have been accomplished, aiming to confer improved stability against aggregation in biological settings. The most frequent strategy followed consists of hydrophilic modifications with molecules able to improve stability and solubility in slightly acid and neutral media such as β-cyclodextrin, succinic anhydride or PEG. Besides, also surface decoration with hydrophilic polymers has been carried out in the attempt to contrast nanoparticles aggregation [160].In particular, stability represents one of the most important factors regulating the efficiency of drug delivery systems, especially in the case of nanoparticles [158].

        <p>However, changes in stability and aggregation of chitosan nanoparticles could also happen during storage. Different techniques of drying (i.e. lyophilization and spray-drying) were applied to aim to both retain the stability of the nanoparticles' features and protect labile bioagents. In aqueous media, nanoparticles could be subjected to different processes such as solubilisation and/ or degradation, drug leakage, desorption or degradation. Generally, nanopowder is easily re-dispersible, but occasionally aggregation or irreversible fusion of particles occurs making the redispersion more difficult. In this regard, the addition of bioprotectants could reduce surface attraction maintaining the nanoparticles dispersed [157].However, changes in stability and aggregation of chitosan nanoparticles could also happen during storage.

        <p>Chitin and chitosan are of high commercial interest due to their high nitrogen content (6.89%), which allows them to be used as chelating agents.

        <p>Chitosan, due to the presence of the primary amine group in the sugar units form the polymeric structure, dissolves in dilute organic acids, but is insoluble in water, above pH 6-7 and in ordinary organic solvents. The solubility of chitinous substances is usually associated with the crystallinity of the sample. Higher crystallinity suggests greater or increased molecular interactions between the polymer chains. A chitinous chemical can be dissolved only if these interactions are cancelled. The intra-and intermolecular hydrogen bonds of the polymer chains are the major cause of these interactions and play an important role in the low solubility of these substances. However, chemical modifications of chitosan result in derivatives that are water-soluble in a broader pH range, including in strongly basic environments. The modifications consist of the introduction of ionic groups or substituents in the polymeric structure, which dissolves in polar solvents such as water through polar-polar interactions and determines the solubility of the macromolecule [155].Chitosan, due to the presence of the primary amine group in the sugar units form the polymeric structure, dissolves in dilute organic acids, but is insoluble in water, above pH 6-7 and in ordinary organic solvents.

        <p>The process of isolation of chitin begins in the marine food industry. One of the by-products of this process, such as carapace of radishes, shrimps, etc., are first crushed to the powdered consistency to achieve a larger surface for the heterogeneous processes that will follow. Initial treatment of carapaces with 5% hydroxide sodium dissolves several proteins leaving chitin, lipids and calcium salt (mainly in the form of CaCO 3 ). By treating with 30% hydrochloric acid, lipids are hydrolyzed, calcium salts (demineralization) and other minor inorganic constituents are broken down. Thus, the chitin obtained can be hydrolyzed using 50% sodium hydroxide at elevated temperatures to obtain chitosan. Alternatively, if isolation of chitin is not desired, the sequence based on acid treatment may be reversed to produce chitosan directly. In this method, crushed carapaces are first treated with 5% hydrochloric acid to remove calcium salts, a process often followed by the removal of proteins and lipids by treatment with 40% sodium hydroxide at higher temperatures. During the treatment with basic medium, concomitant hydrolysis of the acetamide groups of chitin takes place, the result being the formation of chitosan. The physical properties of chitinous substances are governed by two factors: the degree of deacetylation and the molecular mass.The process of isolation of chitin begins in the marine food industry.

        <p>According to a selective nomenclature, chitinous substances that do not dissolve in dilute organic acids (e.g. 1-2% acetic acid) are called chitin, a polymer with a low degree of deacetylation. On the other hand, chitinous substances that dissolve in dilute aqueous acids are called chitosan. Solubility in aqueous acid solutions is achieved by deacetylation to the extent of 60%. However, at the degree of deacetylation between 50-60%, the distribution of the remaining acetyl groups, grafted along the polymer chain, influences the solubility of the sample. A distribution of acetyl groups on the polymer structure results in homogeneous processing conditions and gives solubility of polymers in aqueous solutions of weak acids. Instead, under heterogeneous processing conditions, polymers are formed with distinct blocks of acetylated sugar residues and are not soluble in solvents. similar. The molecular weight of chitosan obtained at the end of the production process depends on the process parameters, time, temperature and HCl and NaOH concentration. The process parameters used in chitosan production are drastic and the cleavage of the chitin structure accompanies the process. The degradation of the chitinous chain can be extended. In one preparation, a chitin sample with a molecular weight of 1.03•10 6 kDa produced chitosan with a weight of 1•10 5 kDa. However, the charged nature of chitosan tends to form free aggregates and the differences in the degree of deacetylation for different chitosan samples require careful implementation of the constants [163].According to a selective nomenclature, chitinous substances that do not dissolve in dilute organic acids (e.g. 1-2% acetic acid) are called chitin, a polymer with a low degree of deacetylation.

        <p>Many applications of any chemical, natural or synthetic, require chemical process ability. Thus, chitosan, a white powder, is difficult to handle due to the problems of solubility in neutral water, bases and organic solvents. The pKa value of the primary amino groups in chitosan is 6.5. Even if chitosan and its derivatives are soluble at a pH lower than 6, most of its applications in the basic or neutral environment cannot be achieved [164].Many applications of any chemical, natural or synthetic, require chemical process ability.

        <p>On the other hand, acidic solutions in which chitosan is soluble are not compatible with many applications, such as those in cosmetics, medicine and nutrition. There are two approaches in the literature on improving the solubility of chitosan at neutral pH. The first is the chemical derivatization of chitosan (for example with substituents containing quaternary ammonium group, by carboxymethylation or sulfation) so that the added substituent is hydrophilic. The second method uses chitosan with 50% diacetylation prepared by homogeneous processing of chitin. Under the conditions of homogeneous processing, the obtained chitosan remains in solution after neutralization and no derivatization is required. Some applications of chitosan use derivatized forms thereof and to improve the solubility it is necessary to introduce ionic groups in the polymeric structure [152].On the other hand, acidic solutions in which chitosan is soluble are not compatible with many applications, such as those in cosmetics, medicine and nutrition.

        <p>Traditionally, chitinous substances are used in rudimentary medicine and the treatment of wastewater. In recent decades, these substances have found their applicability in various fields, from textile engineering to photography. Chitosan and its derivatives have attracted more interest than chitin, even though the latter has found its applicability in medicine, fibre, absorbable tissues and bandages. It is interesting to note the resistance of chitinous substances to bile, pancreatic juice and urine, which leads to their use in surgery, but also the manufacture of human-made fibres for hard materials [95].Traditionally, chitinous substances are used in rudimentary medicine and the treatment of wastewater.

        <p>Chitosan has antimicrobial properties (antibacterial and antifungal). Antibacterial action is rapid and eliminates bacteria within hours. Moreover, its derivatives are biodegradable and exhibit reduced toxicity in mammalian cells.

The antibacterial property of chitosan is useful in medicine, where it is used in the manufacture of surgical accessories such as gloves, bandages, etc. It is also used to remove pathogens from water and as a food preservative by adding a layer to the outside of fruit and vegetable products [166].Chitosan has antimicrobial properties (antibacterial and antifungal).

        <p>As chitosan is obtained by deacetylation (usually not complete) of chitin, studies related to the analytical characterization of chitin and chitosan are not without interest. As can be seen from the structures below, the two substances differ in the presence (in the case of chitin) and the only sporadic presence (in the case of chitosan) of the acetyl group grafted by the amino function. Chitosan is immiscible with water. Some chitosan components contain hydroxyl group components, capable of intermolecular hydrogen bonds, due to the macromolecular character of the compound and due to the many intermolecular hydrogen bonds, even in the solid-state of the sample. It is difficult to discuss the toxicity of this substance, because chitosan is a natural, non-toxic and biodegradable compound, widely used, due to its unique properties, in biotechnology, human and veterinary medicine, but also cosmetics.As chitosan is obtained by deacetylation (usually not complete) of chitin, studies related to the analytical characterization of chitin and chitosan are not without interest.

        <p>The toxicity of chitosan drug administration in animals was reported [173]. For the reasons listed above, the analytical use of IR spectra was passed, in the spectral range 4000-400 cm -1 respectively 200-400 cm -1 , in the transmittance form vs. wave number. The bands are generally large due to the macromolecular character of the compound and due to the numerous intermolecular hydrogen bonds, manifested even in the solid-state of the sample. The absorption bands can be easily attributed to molecular fragments: the dominant band with a maximum at 3450 cm -1 is due to the valence vibrations (stretching, ν O-H and ν N-H) of the O -H and N -H connections involved. intense in hydrogen bonds. the band with maximum absorption at 2870 cm -1 is due to the valence vibrations of the C -H connections. The series of bands between 450 cm -1 and 1750 cm -1 are characteristic of the amide group (the bands "amide I", … "amide VI"). The production of the "amide I" band is due to a vibration mode of the amide group in which the periodic elongation of the C = O bond dominates. Because this band is associated with the acetyl groups in the molecule, its use is warranted to specify the degree of deacetylation of a chitosan sample (the more advanced the acetylation degree, the more intense this band is).The toxicity of chitosan drug administration in animals was reported [173].
