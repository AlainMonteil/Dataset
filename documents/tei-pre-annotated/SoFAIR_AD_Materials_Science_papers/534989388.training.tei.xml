        <p>Near-infrared (NIR) light detection is key to an ever-growing demand for technical solutions in applications such as surveillance systems, facial recognition, industrial sorting and inspection, pulse oximetry, optical coherence tomography, and imaging. [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10] Inorganic semiconductors like Ge, InGaAs, PbS, and HgCdTe allow for broadband light detection from 0.8 up to 10 µm with specific detectivities (D*) near 10 10 Jones or higher.

        <p>some of those conventional materials contain toxic heavy metals and have a rather high overall production cost. Furthermore, commercial NIR imaging sensors have a limited resolution, related to the fact that the photoactive layer is mounted via wire-bonded electrical connections onto the silicon read-out integrated circuitry (ROIC). [12] This limits the smallest pixel pitch to approximately 10 µm since a very precise alignment between the ROIC and the active layer is required. To allow downscaling of the pixel size, an ongoing endeavor focuses on directly growing photo active layers on the ROIC. However, device breakdown upon temperature fluctuations is often observed due to the difference in thermal expansion coefficients between the active layer and the ROIC or the electrical interconnects. [13] Another limit of conventional semiconductors is their broadband absorption. This makes wavelength selectivity only achievable by increasing device complexity, for example through additional optical filters and dichroic prisms, and poses extra limits on the spatial resolution. [14] Given the intrinsic limitations mentioned above, innovation is likely to be material driven. Using sub-micrometer thick, strongly absorbing organic semiconductors, it is possible to decrease the pixel pitch to the diffraction limit of NIR light (around 4 µm) via monolithic integration. [11] Solution processing, combined with the fact that organic semiconductors are less brittle and more resistant to internal thermal stress, enables deposition of organic active layers directly on the ROIC, hereby severely simplifying device fabrication and lowering costs. [15] Furthermore, the absorption window of organic active materials can be fine-tuned via chemical modifications toward specific applications like bioimaging in the second NIR window (between 1000 and 1350 nm). [3,16] These advantages, as well as their non-toxicity, make organic semiconductors a hot topic in the NIR photodetection field.

[22,23] Although narrow-gap organic materials absorbing up to 2 µm are known, [24][25][26] the often observed high dark (and noise) current is one of the major limiting factors, as it strongly increases with a decreasing optical gap. [27,28] While the effect of interfacial layers and traps on the dark and noise current has been elucidated, it is still unclear if under ideal circumstances, organic NIR detectors can reach similar performances as obtained with inorganic photodetectors.

        <p>In this work, four different NIR-photoactive narrow-gap donor polymers are investigated in a photodiode architecture and for the first time the open-circuit voltage (V OC ) is shown to be related to the dark current, noise current, noise equivalent power (NEP) and D*. Specifically for these low E CT systems the dark current is not dominated by the shunt current anymore, resulting in a quantitative relation between V OC and dark current. This relation is generalized for previously reported organic NIR detectors and it is shown how, at low optical gaps, V OC limits the ratio between light and dark current (I ph /I D ). Applying the knowledge on the V OC limits gathered in the organic solar cell field allowed us to calculate an upper limit for the D* of 10 12 and 10 10 Jones at 1500 and 2000 nm, respectively. Moreover, it is found that D* is predominantly limited by non-radiative losses, effectively decreasing D* by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude in comparison to the background limited infrared photodetection (BLIP) for perfectly radiative materials. [11] Nonetheless, given the multiple advantages for commercialization, OPDs remain a viable alternative for the NIR regime up to 2 µm.In this work, four different NIR-photoactive narrow-gap donor polymers are investigated in a photodiode architecture and for the first time the open-circuit voltage (V OC ) is shown to be related to the dark current, noise current, noise equivalent power (NEP) and D*.

In order to calculate upper limits for D*, I 0,R is calculated using Equation ( 9) for a perfect photodiode with a step-like EQE pv , that has its maximum value of 1 for energies above the E CT and 0 below. By taking only the shot noise component of I 0,R into account, D* is calculated via Equation (5a).

By lowering the optical gap, D* decreases down to 5 × 10 13 Jones at 2 µm, which marks the thermodynamic limit of D* for any type of photodetector without photo-multiplicative gain (EQE pv ≤ 1). For organic BHJs, the EQE pv is below 1 and has a strong spectral dependence as well as sub-gap features, which will increase I 0,R in comparison to the step-like EQE pv example and hence decrease D*.

Since I 0,NR ≫ I 0,R , the dark saturation current will be dominated by the non-radiative recombination current and it can be assumed that I 0 = I 0,NR . Subsequently, D* is calculated under consideration of nonradiative recombination currents that are unavoidable in organic BHJs. First, I 0,NR is considered to be independent of E CT and thus constant across the spectrum and corresponding to realistic EQE el values between 10 -3 to 10 -9 .

        <p>Recent reports have identified high frequency molecular vibrations as the source of the rather large non-radiative decay rates in organic BHJs, [40] explaining the previously experimentally observed dependence of I 0,NR on E CT . Below, we distinguish three different cases for ΔV OC,NR as a function of E CT : i) a model-based lower limit for ΔV OC,NR reported by Azzouzi et al. (in which high and low frequency vibrational modes, 150 and 50 meV, respectively, are considered to be low for organic semiconductors, hence providing a lower limit for the non-radiative voltage losses), [45] ii) an empirical lower limit for ΔV OC,NR reported by Benduhn et al., [40] and iii) an average value for ΔV OC,NR as a function of E CT as observed in this study. While case (i) predicts an upper limit for D* to about 10 10 Jones at 2 µm, the empirical and average cases (ii) and (iii) predict that OPDs based on materials with similar recombination properties as the ones found in current BHJs will typically not reach more than 10 9 Jones at 2 µm. At the same time, we expect D* to reach a respectable 10 12 Jones at 1500 nm if the EQE pv can approach 1. This value is comparable to commercial InGaAs detectors and even surpasses commercial Ge detectors (Figure 4b). [47] Importantly, the upper limit of D* decreases significantly faster for models where I 0,NR is dependent on E CT than if it is not. Hence, further red-shifting the absorption to the mid-infrared (2-10 µm) in OPDs is not expected to be useful, as it seems impossible to compete with inorganic alternatives. Nonetheless, OPDs remain a viable alternative for the NIR regime up to 2 µm, given that EQE pv values approaching 1 can be achieved at such low gaps with a steep EQE pv tail onset.Recent reports have identified high frequency molecular vibrations as the source of the rather large non-radiative decay rates in organic BHJs, [40] explaining the previously experimentally observed dependence of I 0,NR on E CT .

        <p>In a recent study, Wu et al. reported on an upper limit for D* that is around a 100 times higher at 2 µm than calculated here. [48] Their model considers as a limit to D* the effect of tailstate broadening on noise related to thermally activated charge generation and recombination over the effective bandgap. Here, we follow a different approach and considered the non-radiative dark saturation current as a more important limiting factor. This dark mechanism has been shown to be present in both non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) containing and NFA free BHJs, and results, as compared to Ref. [48], in a stronger increase in the noise current toward longer wavelengths. [40] To increase D* to the theoretical maximum for NIR organic photodiodes, as indicated by the red curve in Figure 4b, one should find a way to decrease ΔV OC,NR while maintaining the NIR absorption. A reasonable pathway could be the use of NFA materials as these are known to yield lower non-radiative V OC losses. [49,50] A hurdle to overcome is to find a well-performing combination of a NIR-photoactive donor and NFA, as only a selected group of donor materials tend to work well with the best NFAs produced to date. [51] In this work, the intrinsic limit of the specific detectivity of NIR organic photodiodes was determined. For narrow-gap donor polymers combined with fullerene acceptors, the opencircuit voltage was related to the dark current, noise current, and specific detectivity. For devices with open-circuit voltages up to 0.25 V under 100 mW cm -2 illumination, corresponding to effective and optical gaps lower than 0.9 eV, it is found that the experimental dark current approaches its theoretical limit. Above 0.25 V, the deviation increases with increasing opencircuit voltage. Moreover, it is observed that the upper limit for the D* of NIR OPDs is predominantly limited by non-radiative losses, effectively decreasing D* by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude in comparison to the BLIP for perfectly radiative materials. This allowed to calculate an intrinsic upper limit for D* of 10 12 and 10 10 Jones at 1500 and 2000 nm, respectively.
