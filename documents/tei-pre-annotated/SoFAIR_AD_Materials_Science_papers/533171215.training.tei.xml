        <p>The massive and uncontrolled use of food packaging derived from petroleum-based plastics has created a serious environmental problem. Hence, the food packaging industry needs to develop packaging from biodegradable polymers. Among the many raw materials studied in the literature, chitosan is one of the most abundant polysaccharides in the nature. Chitosan has attracted attention due to its non-toxicity, antimicrobial, and antifungal properties. Because of this, chitosan is considered a perfect material for the development of films for food use. In this review, recent studies on active and/or intelligent chitosan-based films has been evaluated. Active packaging maintains or improves the condition of packaged food or extends its shelf-life meanwhile intelligent packaging monitors the condition of packaged food or the environment surrounding the food. The effect of the addition of active compounds on the mechanical, barrier and functional properties of chitosan-based films has been assessed. The antimicrobial and antioxidant activity, as well as the potential application of these active and intelligent composite films have also been revised. Literature shows that the presence of phenolic compounds improves both mechanical and barrier properties of chitosan films. The antimicrobial and antioxidant capacity of the films improved significantly by the addition of essential oils, phenolic compounds, and other fruit extracts. Intelligent pH-indicator chitosan-based films have been extensively studied. Further research on chitosan and its combinations with other materials is needed to study which type of foodstuffs could be in contact with chitosan packaging.The massive and uncontrolled use of food packaging derived from petroleum-based plastics has created a serious environmental problem.

        <p>Food packaging plays an important role protecting from chemical, physical, and biological hazards along the food chain. Packaging is essential to deal with the influences (odors, shocks, dust, temperature, light, humidity) that facing food (Kalpana, Priyadarshini, Maria Leena, Moses, &amp; Anandharamakrishnan, 2019). The development of petroleum-based polymers such as polypropylene, polyester and ethylene vinyl alcohol and others allowed the changing of metal, glass or cardboard packaging into plastic packaging (Brody, Bugusu, Han, Sand, &amp; McHugh, 2008). Nowadays, petroleum-based products are the most widely used materials in the food packaging industry because of its good properties at relative low price (Ludwicka, Kaczmarek, &amp; Białkowska, 2020).Food packaging plays an important role protecting from chemical, physical, and biological hazards along the food chain.

        <p>Nevertheless, massive use of petroleum-based materials leads to a negative impact on the environment since they are not derived from sustainable sources, not recyclable, compostable or biodegradable (Ludwicka et al., 2020;Motelica et al., 2020). Food packaging research must address the environmental problems derived from the uncontrolled consumption and management of non-biodegradable materials, developing new alternative materials with lower environmental impact. This way, biodegradable natural polymers are the focus of a wide range of research to apply them as alternatives to petroleum-based synthetics. Biodegradable natural polymers widely studied for prospective applications in food packaging industry are chitosan (Priyadarshi &amp; Rhim, 2020), cellulose (Cazón &amp; Vázquez, 2021;da Silva et al., 2021;de Medeiros et al., 2021;Wang, Lu, &amp; Zhang, 2016), starch (Fang, Fu, Tao, Liu, &amp; Cui, 2020), whey protein (Schmid &amp; Müller, 2018) or gelatin (Ramos, Valdés, Beltrán, &amp; Garrigós, 2016) among others. Among the available natural biodegradable materials, chitosan has aroused great interest in recent decades. As shown Fig. 1, a strong increase in the number of publications related to chitosan and packaging industry in recent years can be observed.Nevertheless, massive use of petroleum-based materials leads to a negative impact on the environment since they are not derived from sustainable sources, not recyclable, compostable or biodegradable (Ludwicka et al., 2020;Motelica et al., 2020).

        <p>Chitosan and its derivatives are biodegradable polysaccharides, nontoxic and biocompatible, as well as with antimicrobial, antifungal and chelating metals properties (Aider, 2010;Bakshi, Selvakumar, Kadirvelu, &amp; Kumar, 2020). Besides, thanks to its extraordinary film-forming properties, chitosan has been investigated for use mainly in the food, biomedical and chemical industries (Siripatrawan &amp; Harte, 2010).Chitosan and its derivatives are biodegradable polysaccharides, nontoxic and biocompatible, as well as with antimicrobial, antifungal and chelating metals properties (Aider, 2010;Bakshi, Selvakumar, Kadirvelu, &amp; Kumar, 2020).

        <p>Chitosan is synthesized by deacetylation of chitin (poly (β-(1 → 4)-Nacetyl-D-glucosamine)), an important natural polysaccharide known since 1884. Chitin is synthesized by many living organisms. It can be obtained from multiple renewable sources, mainly waste from the seafood industry (Cazón &amp; Vázquez, 2019;Younes &amp; Rinaudo, 2015). Hence, chitosan is a cheap and commercially available polysaccharide. In solid phase, chitosan is semi-crystalline, and generally soluble in dilute organic acid such as acetic, citric, formic, lactic, malic or tartaric acid among others (Cazón &amp; Vázquez, 2019;Rhim, Weller, &amp; Ham, 1998). Due to the mentioned chitosan properties, the interest in using it as a material for food packaging films or coatings is growing.Chitosan is synthesized by deacetylation of chitin (poly (β-(1 → 4)-Nacetyl-D-glucosamine)), an important natural polysaccharide known since 1884.

        <p>Recent changes in food demand, industrial production trends (fresh, tasty, longer shelf-life and quality controlled products), retail sales and consumer lifestyles (limited time for shopping and cooking) are leading to the evolution of new packaging techniques beyond a passive container and physical barrier tool (Dainelli, Gontard, Spyropoulos, Zondervan-van den Beuken, &amp; Tobback, 2008).Recent changes in food demand, industrial production trends (fresh, tasty, longer shelf-life and quality controlled products), retail sales and consumer lifestyles (limited time for shopping and cooking) are leading to the evolution of new packaging techniques beyond a passive container and physical barrier tool (Dainelli, Gontard, Spyropoulos, Zondervan-van den Beuken, &amp; Tobback, 2008).</p>
        <p>Novel food packaging techniques should target the main causes of food product deteriorations and ensure greater food safety. Thus, the packaging industry is looking for solutions that allow to have functional properties such as specific gas barrier, gas or moisture absorbents, UV protection, antioxidant activity, antimicrobial properties, or monitoring capacity to report product quality. These new packages will extend the food shelf-life, and will allow products to be stored for longer periods (Wyrwa &amp; Barska, 2017). The two mains innovative packaging technologies that have emerged to face this challenge are active and intelligent packaging.Novel food packaging techniques should target the main causes of food product deteriorations and ensure greater food safety.

        <p>Active packaging is the materials and articles that are intended to maintain or improve the conditions of the packaged food or to extend its shelf-life (European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) (2009). This type of packaging interacts with food, maintaining nutritional quality, inhibiting the growth of pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms or preventing the migration of contaminants. Typical examples of active packaging are oxygen scavengers, carbon dioxide emitters/absorbers, moisture absorbers, ethylene absorbers, ethanol emitters, antioxidants, flavor releasing/absorbing systems, and antimicrobial films (Ozdemir &amp; Floros, 2004).Active packaging is the materials and articles that are intended to maintain or improve the conditions of the packaged food or to extend its shelf-life (European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) (2009).

        <p>On the other hand, intelligent packaging is materials and articles that monitor the condition of packaged food or the environment surrounding the food (European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) (2009); Restuccia et al., 2010). These packages can communicate the conditions of the package food. However, these packages do not interact with the food (Müller &amp; Schmid, 2019). This packaging performs intelligent functions such as: detecting, register, tracking and communicating information to extend shelf-life, improve quality, and warn of potential problems (Yam, Takhistov, &amp; M, 2006).On the other hand, intelligent packaging is materials and articles that monitor the condition of packaged food or the environment surrounding the food (European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) (2009); Restuccia et al., 2010).

        <p>For instance, time-temperature indicators, gas leakage indicators, relative humidity or freshness sensors are different types of intelligent packaging (Müller &amp; Schmid, 2019). The main properties of active and intelligent packaging are summarized in Fig. 2.For instance, time-temperature indicators, gas leakage indicators, relative humidity or freshness sensors are different types of intelligent packaging (Müller &amp; Schmid, 2019).

        <p>Regarding the legislative framework, specific legislation has been developed in the European Union (EC 450/2009) on active and intelligent materials and articles intended to come into contact with food (European Union, 2009). In addition, substances responsible for performing the active or intelligent function of the material must be evaluated to ensure that they are safe and comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC 1935(EC /2004) on materials and articles intended to come into contact with food (European Commission, 2004, pp. 4-17).Regarding the legislative framework, specific legislation has been developed in the European Union (EC 450/2009) on active and intelligent materials and articles intended to come into contact with food (European Union, 2009).

        <p>The purpose of this review is to present a concise assessment of the latest developments in active and intelligent packaging based on chitosan. Emphasis will be put on the effect of the active additives on the mechanical, barrier and functional properties of the developed active and/or intelligent chitosan-based films.

        <p>Active film is one to which active components are deliberately added, which release or absorb substances with the aim of increasing the shelf-life, maintaining the quality and sensory characteristics of the food (Yildirim et al., 2018). Active packaging can be divided into two sections: active scavenging systems (absorbers) and active release systems (emitters).Active film is one to which active components are deliberately added, which release or absorb substances with the aim of increasing the shelf-life, maintaining the quality and sensory characteristics of the food (Yildirim et al., 2018).

        <p>Active release systems include antioxidant releasers, CO 2 emitters and antimicrobial packaging systems (Yildirim et al., 2018). In the literature, most of the active films developed using chitosan as the main polymeric matrix are antioxidant and/or antimicrobial films. It is mainly due to the great interest that have aroused in recent years on the use of active agents from natural sources, such as essential oils and phenolic compounds widely distributed in fruits, vegetables, legumes, seeds, among others. These active agents with powerful antimicrobial and/or antioxidant properties combined with biodegradable polymeric matrices are presented as a promising tool to develop food coatings or films. These active materials directly applied in food allow extending its shelf-life, guaranteeing its quality and food safety. For instances, chitosan films combined with tree tea, bergamot, clove bud, cinnamon or Eucalyptus globulus among other essential oils have shown both antimicrobial and antioxidant properties (Hafsa et al., 2016;Perdones, Vargas, Atarés, &amp; Chiralt, 2014;Sánchez-González, Cháfer, Chiralt, &amp; González-Martínez, 2010;Sánchez-González, González-Martínez, Chiralt, &amp; Cháfer, 2010;Xin Zhang, Zou, et al., 2019).Active release systems include antioxidant releasers, CO 2 emitters and antimicrobial packaging systems (Yildirim et al., 2018).

        <p>Active scavenging systems include oxygen scavengers, moisture scavenger and ethylene absorbers (Yildirim et al., 2018). Oxygen scavengers in form of film or pad absorb the oxygen present in the headspace of the package, leading to extend the shelf-life and retainment of the food quality (Dey &amp; Neogi, 2019). Singh, Nwabor, Sukri, and Voravuthikunchai (2021) have developed Chitosan-based films with oxygen scavenger properties by adding gallic acid and sodium carbonate to the polymer matrix. On the other hand, ethylene is a growth-stimulating hormone that accelerates maturation and senescence through increasing the rate of food respiration (Ozdemir &amp; Floros, 2004). The incorporation of TiO 2 nanoparticles in chitosan films provides ethylene scavengers properties to the biopolymer (Siripatrawan &amp; Kaewklin, 2018;Xin Zhang, Zou, et al., 2019).Active scavenging systems include oxygen scavengers, moisture scavenger and ethylene absorbers (Yildirim et al., 2018).

        <p>Regarding intelligent films based on chitosan, two main groups of intelligent packaging from chitosan were developed: (1) films with a visual color alteration due to colorimetric reactions and (2) sophisticated biosensors. In the first group time-temperature indicators, freshness indicators or pH indicators are included (Kalpana et al., 2019). This Time-temperature indicators are used to monitor a food's condition in real-time, indicating the overall influence of temperature on food product quality. Chitosan-gold nanoparticles composite can indicate the frozen state and thermal history of food based on the visual color change that accompanies the agglomeration of gold nanoparticles due to their localized surface plasmon resonance (Wang, Mohan, Guan, Ravishankar, &amp; Gunasekaran, 2018). The color of the Chitosan-gold nanoparticles composite irreversibly becomes more intense from pink to dark grey as function of the temperature (Wang et al., 2018). Maciel, Yoshida, and Franco (2012) also has developed chitosan colorimetric temperature indicator for temperatures between 40 and 70 • C, using heat-sensitive anthocyanin with irreversible visual color changes. Laccase was immobilized on electrospun chitosan fiber to prepare time-temperature indicator for food quality monitoring. Laccases, mainly catalyzing the oxidation of phenolic compounds such as aminophenols, polyphenols, and phenols, can oxidize guaiacol with visual and color changes from transparent to deep brown or deep purple-brown (Jhuang et al., 2020).Regarding intelligent films based on chitosan, two main groups of intelligent packaging from chitosan were developed: (1) films with a visual color alteration due to colorimetric reactions and (2) sophisticated biosensors.

        <p>Materials that monitor changes in the pH of food through color change are capable to detect the microbial growth and oxidative degradation of food due to the physical-chemical alterations of the food (Singh, Nwabor, et al., 2021). These materials are used mainly as indicators of pH and freshness of food, although there are also examples of monitoring CO 2 production by establishing a relationship between the pH-CO 2 produced.Materials that monitor changes in the pH of food through color change are capable to detect the microbial growth and oxidative degradation of food due to the physical-chemical alterations of the food (Singh, Nwabor, et al., 2021).

        <p>Anthocyanins are a major part of phenolic compounds and the most important subclass of flavonoids. They are pigments that show color changes with pH changes (Li et al., 2017;Zhang et al., 2019). Anthocyanins also have powerful antioxidant properties, and it is common to find studies of active and intelligent materials evaluation with both characteristics of anthocyanins. For instance, curcumin loaded chitosan and polyethylene oxide nanofiber film has been developed as freshness indicator of chicken breast package at 4 • C. The color of nanofiber film changed from bright yellow to reddish color which provided an opportunity to detect color changes by even the naked eyes of the untrained consumer (Yildiz, Sumnu, &amp; Kahyaoglu, 2021).Anthocyanins are a major part of phenolic compounds and the most important subclass of flavonoids.

        <p>The CO 2 was monitored during the respiration of fruits and vegetables, as well as microorganisms on their surface by adding indicator of bromocresol blue and methyl red to chitosan intelligent label. The color change of the films at different pH values showed a good linear relationship with CO 2 concentration (Wan et al., 2021).The CO 2 was monitored during the respiration of fruits and vegetables, as well as microorganisms on their surface by adding indicator of bromocresol blue and methyl red to chitosan intelligent label.

        <p>Also based on colorimetric reactions, the addition of quercetin to chitosan films makes it possible to intelligently detect aluminum (Al 3+ ) in food (Bai et al., 2019), since quercetin can form bonds with Al 3+ producing a colored complex.Also based on colorimetric reactions, the addition of quercetin to chitosan films makes it possible to intelligently detect aluminum (Al 3+ ) in food (Bai et al., 2019), since quercetin can form bonds with Al 3+ producing a colored complex.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, chitosan presents potential application for the development of biosensors thanks to its specific sorption properties. The applications of Chitosan-based biosensors in intelligent food packaging are being investigated, although it is still necessary to delve into this topic. Sophisticated humidity and temperature sensors have been developed from chitosan and CuMn 2 O 4 -spinel nanopowder based on impedance change. With rising temperature, the impedance of the sensor decreases and can be attributed to charge carriers generation under the effect of temperature (Chani, Karimov, Khan, Fatima, &amp; Asiri, 2019). Other humidity sensors are based on chitosan-zinc oxide and single-walled carbon nanotube. In this case, the sensing mechanism is attributed to the swelling effect of chitosan surrounding the nanotubes that changes the hopping conduction path between nanotubes (Dai, Feng, Li, Zhang, &amp; Li, 2019).On the other hand, chitosan presents potential application for the development of biosensors thanks to its specific sorption properties.

        <p>A quartz crystal microbalance electrode coated with chitosan film has evaluated as a sensor for volatile organic compounds detection (Ayad, Salahuddin, &amp; Minisy, 2014). The coating of the quartz crystal microbalance with appropriate sensing material as chitosan-based allowed to observe the responds to specific analytes in the form of frequency shift, which results from the mass increase caused by sorption of analytes onto the sensing material (Zhang, Hu, Fan, &amp; Li, 2017). Qi, Xu, Zhang, Fei, and Wang (2020) have developed humidity sensors based on quartz crystal microbalance coated with chitosan-multiwalled carbon nanotubes. The optimized sensor possesses high response sensitivity, negligible humidity hysteresis, quick response and recovery time, and remarkable reversibility, repeatability, long-term stability and selectivity. Graphene oxide/chitosan nanocomposite coated quartz crystal microbalance sensor for detection of amine vapors was also studied. At room temperature, the sensor exhibited high sensitivity to aliphatic amines including methylamine, dimethylamine and trimethylamine with detection limits below 3 mg/L (Zhang, Hu, et al., 2017).A quartz crystal microbalance electrode coated with chitosan film has evaluated as a sensor for volatile organic compounds detection (Ayad, Salahuddin, &amp; Minisy, 2014).

        <p>Enzymatic and electrochemical biosensors have been developed to detect specific molecules. A cholesterol biosensor was developed by the immobilization of cholesterol oxidase onto the chitosan nanofibers and gold nanoparticles composite network (Gomathi et al., 2011). Lactose biosensor has been obtained from chitosan composites containing Co-hemin metal organic frameworks and cellobiose dehydrogenase (Choi et al., 2020).Enzymatic and electrochemical biosensors have been developed to detect specific molecules.

        <p>The development of active and intelligent chitosan-based materials requires the addition of specific agents that aims to improve certain functional properties. However, the incorporation of new components in the chitosan structure may affect other physicochemical properties such as mechanical and water vapor permeability (WVP) properties, giving modified polymer matrix with respect to pure chitosan films. The new physicochemical properties of the resulting matrix will determine the suitability of each film for each application or the need for new reformulations to modify or reinforce the polymer structure.The development of active and intelligent chitosan-based materials requires the addition of specific agents that aims to improve certain functional properties.

        <p>Measuring mechanical properties allows predicting the behavior of the material under different food processing and handling conditions (Cazón, Velazquez, Ramírez, &amp; Vázquez, 2017). The most widely mechanical properties analyzed and reported in the literature are tensile strength (TS) and percentage of elongation at break (%E). The maximum tension that the film can withstand before it breaks is called tensile strength. On the other hand, the greatest elongation of the film before rupture is expressed as a percentage of elongation at break (Cazón et al., 2017).Measuring mechanical properties allows predicting the behavior of the material under different food processing and handling conditions (Cazón, Velazquez, Ramírez, &amp; Vázquez, 2017).

        <p>According to studies carried out by several authors, the mechanical properties of chitosan films can be modified by multiple factors. The characteristics of the chitosan (degree of deacetylation, molecular weight), the film production method, the chitosan concentration, the storage time, the conditions at the time of the measurements and throughout the test, and the chitosan solvent employed are factors that affect the mechanical properties (Cazón &amp; Vázquez, 2019). Besides, it must be taken into account that the mechanical strength of a film depends on the composition of the composite polymer, their intermolecular forces, the crystallinity degree and the microstructure of the film network (Pastor, Sánchez-González, Chiralt, Cháfer, &amp; González-Martínez, 2013). Hence, the active agents used to enrich the chitosan-based matrix may affect the mechanical properties of the resulted composite. For comparative purposes, Table 1 shows the tensile strength and elongation at break of different chitosan-based films combined with antioxidant agents.According to studies carried out by several authors, the mechanical properties of chitosan films can be modified by multiple factors.

        <p>Research reflects that the essential oils used have showed highly variable effect on the mechanical properties of chitosan-based films. The essential oil effect depends on their own composition, the final concentration reached on the chitosan solution and the specific interactions that occur within the polymer matrix. Generally, studies have showed that the incompatibility between the hydrophobic essential oils and chitosan gives a disrupted microstructure. The structural arrangements of the lipid phase in the chitosan network that results in a discontinuous and porous matrix promotes uneven physical interactions. Consequently, the enriched chitosan-films possess lower mechanical resistance properties, such lower TS and %E values than pure chitosan samples (Moalla et al., 2021;Wang et al., 2011). This effect has been observed by the addition of essential oils such as Perilla frustescens (Zhang et al., 2018), Artemisia campestris (Moalla et al., 2021), Thymus vulgaris (Altiok, Altiok, &amp; Tihminlioglu, 2010), Zataria multifora Boiss (Moradi et al., 2012), tea tree (Sánchez-González, González-Martínez, et al., 2010), bergamot (Sánchez-González, González-Martínez, et al., 2010), citronella and cedarwood (Shen &amp; Kamdem, 2015), basil (Amor et al., 2021), caraway (Hromiš et al., 2015), cinnamon (Perdones et al., 2014;Wang et al., 2011;Zhang et al., 2019), clove (Wang et al., 2011), ginger (Pimpinella anisum L.)

        <p>However, the new formed interactions depend on the composition of each oil and the presence of other compounds as emulsifying agents. For example, subsequent studies of chitosan-tree tea essential oils (Cazón, Antoniewska, Rutkowska, &amp; Vázquez, 2021) with soy lecithin as emulsifying agents have showed a plasticizing effect of the tea tree due to the homogeneous dispersion of the oil within the chitosan matrix. The resulted active samples have showed higher %E values and lower TS than neat chitosan films. Wang, Zhang, Yang, and He (2021) has observed that the addition of small amounts of clove essential oil (Eugenia caryophyllata) (less than 1% w/w) significantly increases the % E (56.7-78.6%) values with slightly variation on the TS (6.7-6.3 N/mm 2 ) values by increasing the essential oil concentration. In this case, the composition of the essential oil, mainly eugenol and acetyl eugenol which are considered weak acids, easily promote the formation of new stronger interactions. The new polymer-essential oil interactions allow greater deformation of the structure without weakening it (Wang et al., 2021). Similar results were obtained by adding Eucalyptus globulus essential oil (Azadbakht, Maghsoudlou, Khomiri, &amp; Kashiri, 2018).However, the new formed interactions depend on the composition of each oil and the presence of other compounds as emulsifying agents.

        <p>A less common result was obtained by Mahdavi et al. (2018), where the addition of anise (Pimpinella anisum L.) essential oil produced an increase in both TS and %E. The authors justify this mechanical behavior due to the hydrophilicity and high molecular weight of the phenolic compounds of anise essential oil. These properties reduce the softening in the film and increase the TS values (Mahdavi et al., 2018).

        <p>On the other hand, other phenolic compounds as steam and seed Pistacia terebinthus extracts, ellagic acid (Vilela et al., 2017) and the pH-sensitives purple and black rice extracts (Yong et al., 2019) and purple tomato anthocyanins (Li, Wu, Wang, &amp; Li, 2021) act as plasticizers, promoting the increase of the %E and the decrease of TS (Kaya et al., 2018). Singh, Nwabor, et al. (2021) added gallic acid and sodium carbonate to the chitosan film to develop oxygen scavenger material. Gallic acid is antioxidant but also absorbs a high amount of oxygen when exposing to the alkaline environment. The result is a decrease in both mechanical parameters as the concentration of the compounds added increase. This may be due to the large amount of sodium carbonate cracking the internal matrix of the chitosan film (Singh, Nwabor, et al., 2021) since chitosan/gallic acid/glycerol films showed a mechanical reinforcement with higher TS values (Zarandona, Puertas, Dueñas, Guerrero, &amp; de la Caba, 2020).On the other hand, other phenolic compounds as steam and seed Pistacia terebinthus extracts, ellagic acid (Vilela et al., 2017) and the pH-sensitives purple and black rice extracts (Yong et al., 2019) and purple tomato anthocyanins (Li, Wu, Wang, &amp; Li, 2021) act as plasticizers, promoting the increase of the %E and the decrease of TS (Kaya et al., 2018).

        <p>Barrier properties play an important role in the preservation of food products, since one of the main functions of the packaging films is separating foods from surrounding atmosphere to retard food deterioration. Among these properties, the most studied is water vapor permeability (WVP). The WVP indicates the amount of water that permeates per unit of area and time (g/m⋅s⋅Pa). Generally, the main goal is to develop films that keep the WVP values as low as possible to avoid moisture transfer between food and the surrounding atmosphere (Riaz et al., 2018). Most of the WVP results obtained on biodegradable films available in the literature have been calculated gravimetrically following the American Society for Testing and Materials Standard Test Method E96/E96M (ASTM), known as the "cup method" (Cazón et al., 2017).Barrier properties play an important role in the preservation of food products, since one of the main functions of the packaging films is separating foods from surrounding atmosphere to retard food deterioration.

        <p>Lipidic compounds as the essential oils have been added to chitosan matrix with the aim of improving their barrier properties. Nevertheless, the addition of essential oil does not produce a general downward trend. The effect on the barrier properties is strongly affected by the composition of the lipid component used as addictive and the interactions that take place into the structure.

It is believed that this effect may be due to covalent interactions between the matrix and the constituent components of the essential oil (mainly oxygenated terpenes) which causes a cross-linking reaction (Shen &amp; Kamdem, 2015).Lipidic compounds as the essential oils have been added to chitosan matrix with the aim of improving their barrier properties.

The hydrogen and covalent interactions between the chitosan network and the extract's own phenolic compounds reduce the availability of hydrophilic groups, decreasing the affinity of the chitosan matrix to water molecules (Balti et al., 2017;Kurek et al., 2018;Peng et al., 2013). Slightly WVP values variations have been observed by the addition of anthocyanins from purple and black eggplant extracts (Yong et al., 2019) or a WVP increase by the addition of ellagic acid (Vilela et al., 2017).In the case of the addition of phenolic compounds, a predominant trend can be observed in the effect of these compounds on the permeability properties of chitosan.

        <p>Regarding ethylene scavenger, Siripatrawan and Kaewklin (2018) and Xin Zhang, Zou, et al. (2019) have developed chitosan film to which TiO 2 nanocomposites were added. The authors have observed that the water insoluble TiO 2 can block water vapor micro-paths in the microstructure of the film, promoting the decrease in WVP values (Xin Zhang, Zou, et al., 2019). This behavior has also been repeated by the addition of another particles such as zeolite as ethylene adsorption (do Nascimento Sousa et al., 2020) and silver nanoparticles as antimicrobial agents (Qin et al., 2019).Regarding ethylene scavenger, Siripatrawan and Kaewklin (2018) and Xin Zhang, Zou, et al.

        <p>The same trend was found for the O 2 scavenger. Gallic acid/sodium carbonate reduce the WVP values of the chitosan samples from 8.63⋅10 -10 to 6.41⋅10 -10 g/m⋅s⋅Pa (Singh, Nwabor, et al., 2021). This can be explained by the fact as the concentration of gallic acid in the chitosan amine increases, the benzene ring group of the acid become more present. This hinders the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonding of chitosan (Singh, Nwabor, et al., 2021), making the membrane less permeable.The same trend was found for the O 2 scavenger.

        <p>The ability of an antioxidant to block or delay the oxidation of other molecules is called antioxidant activity (Zhang, Zhang, Chen, Ma, &amp; Xia, 2021). The main values to be analyzed for the antioxidant capacity of the film are DPPH• radical scavenging, ABTS•+ radical scavenging and total phenolic content (TPC).The ability of an antioxidant to block or delay the oxidation of other molecules is called antioxidant activity (Zhang, Zhang, Chen, Ma, &amp; Xia, 2021).

        <p>Pure chitosan-based film has a very low radical scavenging activity, which can be explained by the fact that chitosan does not have any hydrogen atoms that can be easily supplied to serve as a good antioxidant (Schreiber, Bozell, Hayes, &amp; Zivanovic, 2013). Another fact that is related to the poor antioxidant activity of chitosan films is the weak free radical scavenging ability of free amino groups at the C-2 position of chitosan chains (Genskowsky et al., 2015). To improve the antioxidant properties of chitosan, some natural active compounds such as essential oils and polyphenols have been added by physical mixing into the chitosan matrix to produce composite films. For comparative purposes, Table 3 shows the antioxidant property values of various enriched chitosan -based films.Pure chitosan-based film has a very low radical scavenging activity, which can be explained by the fact that chitosan does not have any hydrogen atoms that can be easily supplied to serve as a good antioxidant (Schreiber, Bozell, Hayes, &amp; Zivanovic, 2013).

        <p>It is worth highlighting the components that have shown the greatest antioxidant capacity with promising applications in the food industry. The addition of 0.5-2% (w/v) of green or black tea extracts have been enough to obtain chitosan films with DPPH • radical scavenging activity higher than 90% (Peng et al., 2013). Other plant extracts as caraway oil, at low concentrations 1% (v/v) can reach around 80% DPPH • value (Hromiš et al., 2015). The antioxidant capacity of Artemisia campestris hydroalcoholic extract and aqueous extract has been evaluated. Results demonstrated that the hydroalcoholic fraction has higher antioxidant capacity (96.79% DPPH • ) due to the higher total phenolic and flavonoid contents than the aqueous fraction (70% DPPH • ) (Moalla et al., 2021). The acid selected for the preparation of the chitosan film-forming solution could affect the antioxidant properties of the added essential oil. Analysis of chitosan -tree tea oil comparing lactic or malic acid as solvent have demonstrated that chitosan films contained malic acid possess 6.5-7.5 higher DPPH • scavenging capacity (61.24% DPPH • ) than that contained lactic acid (8.31% DPPH • ) (Cazón et al., 2021). Malic acid has showed a synergic effect as promoter agents for antioxidant activity of the tree tea oil terpens. The lipophilic compound α-tocopherol from edible oils, such as palm oil, sunflower oil, has been one of the components that has shown the highest scavenging activity with DPPH • values of 97% for very small concentrations of compound in the final film (0.1-0.2% w/v) (Martins et al., 2012).It is worth highlighting the components that have shown the greatest antioxidant capacity with promising applications in the food industry.

        <p>The effect of active chitosan films added with some spices extracts as thyme, clove, prickly ash, fennel, geranium and cinnamon on antioxidant capacity has been studied (Liu, Liu, Gong, Chi, &amp; Ma, 2021).

        <p>The high capacity to increase total phenolic content and radical scavenging activity is related to the high presence in the spices of flavonoids and phenols with excellent antioxidant properties (Liu et al., 2021). Other examples of this effect was observed by Zhang, et al., (2020) with the addition of plant extracts such as pine nut shell extract, peanut shell extract and jujube leaf extract. The film with the best result was the one with the addition of jujube leaf extract, which was related to the high amount of phenolic compounds and flavonoids in its composition (Zhang et al., 2020). Fruit extracts have shown to have a high content of polyphenolic agents with powerful antioxidant capacity. For example, ABTS •+ and DPPH • values ranged from 70 to 90% for chitosan samples enriched with apple extract at a concentration between 0.25 and 1% have been reported (Riaz et al., 2018;L.;Sun et al., 2017). The chitosan-banana peel extract films have demonstrate a DPPH • values ranged 52-89%, ABTS values ranged 42-96%, TPC values ranged 2.8-4.8 mg GAE/g (Zhang et al., 2020). Protocatechuic acid, which is commonly found in fruits, edible plants and vegetables, allow developing CH films with DPPH • values range between 40 and 100% (Liu et al., 2016).The high capacity to increase total phenolic content and radical scavenging activity is related to the high presence in the spices of flavonoids and phenols with excellent antioxidant properties (Liu et al., 2021).

        <p>Phenolic compounds used to obtain pH-sensitive material also possess antioxidant capacity that allow developing antioxidant films as well. Some examples are the active and intelligent chitosan-based material developed by Yong et al. (2019) who has observed that purple and black eggplant extracts in chitosan films possess a DPPH • scavenging activity up to 44-46%. Black and purple rice extracts on chitosan samples have shown similar values (Yong et al., 2019a). In this case, the black rice extracts show a better antioxidant effect than the purple one. This was attributed to the fact that the polyphenols present in the extract are able to scavenge free radicals through the donation of phenolic hydrogen atoms (Yang et al., 2019).Phenolic compounds used to obtain pH-sensitive material also possess antioxidant capacity that allow developing antioxidant films as well.

        <p>In films with O 2 scavenger capacity, the addition of gallic acid has been studied by Zarandona et al. (2020). Results show an increase in DPPH • radical scavenging capacity (up to 96.4%), concluding that gallic acid can also be considered as an active agent to be taken into account in the development of active films (Zarandona et al., 2020). Chitosan/gallic acid/sodium carbonate films have shown an outstanding improvement of the O 2 scavenging capacity from 1.82 to 19.55 mL O 2 /g by increasing the sodium carbonate concentration (Singh, Singh, Kumar, Kirtiraj, et al., 2021).In films with O 2 scavenger capacity, the addition of gallic acid has been studied by Zarandona et al.

The degree of deacetylation, molecular weight, film forming conditions, pH, temperature, and other parameters influence chitosan's antibacterial effectiveness.

        <p>Molds, fungi, and yeast are also microorganisms that should be avoided. For instance, chitosan films combined with tree tea or bergamot essential oil have been tested against Penicillium italicum but the power of inhibition of the composite films decreased throughout the storage time (Sánchez-González, Cháfer, et al., 2010;Sánchez-González, González-Martínez et al., 2010). Inhibition of Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus oryzae, Botrytis cinerea, Rhizopus stolonifera and Penicillium digitatum fungi has been observed by the addition of clove bud and cinnamon essential oils to chitosan film (Perdones et al., 2014;Wang et al., 2011;Zhang et al., 2019). The incorporation of turmeric essential oil into chitosan allowed developing films with satisfactory and significant anti-aflatoxigenic activity thanks to the observed antifungal properties against Aspergillus flavus (Li et al., 2019). Yeasts such as Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis are also successfully inhibited by the application of Eucalyptus globulus essential oil on chitosan matrix (Hafsa et al., 2016). The strong antimicrobial effect of essential oils to some extent due to their content of terpenes, which affect the permeability and other functions of the bacterial membranes.

        <p>In the literature, the most studied chitosan-based active films are those with antioxidant capacity. The antioxidant chitosan-based films enriched with olive pomace (de Moraes Crizel et al., 2018) and mango leaf extract (Rambabu et al., 2019) have successfully tested as a high protective film against the oxidation of nuts for 31 and 28 days, respectively. The authors verified the powerful antioxidant effect of the developed chitosan active films by analyzing the peroxide value of the oil of the nuts (de Moraes Crizel et al., 2018;Rambabu et al., 2019). Assays on physical parameters such as color, firmness, weight loss or respiration rate during storage time of fresh fruit or vegetables also indicate the positive effect of antioxidant chitosan films. For instance, films enriched with clove (Eugenia caryophyllata) essential oil (Wang et al., 2021), banana peels extract (Zhang et al., 2020), ascorbic acid (Sun, Liang, Xie, Lei, &amp; Mo, 2010;Özdemir &amp; Gökmen, 2017;Özdemir, Sultan, &amp; Gökmen, 2019), aloe vera (Shah &amp; Hashmi, 2020), procyanidins (Mannozzi et al., 2018) improve certain parameters for the storage time of apples, pomegranate arils, blueberry, mango, litchi fruit. Similar results have showed films with citric acid to preserve the color and texture of green chilli (Priyadarshi, Sauraj, Kumar, &amp; Negi, 2018), or with the addition of α-tocopherol on mushroom to allow a maintained of firmness and alleviation of browning of these products (Zhang et al., 2020).In the literature, the most studied chitosan-based active films are those with antioxidant capacity. The antioxidant chitosan-based films enriched with olive pomace (de Moraes Crizel et al., 2018) and mango leaf extract (Rambabu et al., 2019) have successfully tested as a high protective film against the oxidation of nuts for 31 and 28 days, respectively. The authors verified the powerful antioxidant effect of the developed chitosan active films by analyzing the peroxide value of the oil of the nuts (de Moraes Crizel et al., 2018;Rambabu et al., 2019). Assays on physical parameters such as color, firmness, weight loss or respiration rate during storage time of fresh fruit or vegetables also indicate the positive effect of antioxidant chitosan films. For instance, films enriched with clove (Eugenia caryophyllata) essential oil (Wang et al., 2021), banana peels extract (Zhang et al., 2020), ascorbic acid (Sun, Liang, Xie, Lei, &amp; Mo, 2010;Özdemir &amp; Gökmen, 2017;Özdemir, Sultan, &amp; Gökmen, 2019), aloe vera (Shah &amp; Hashmi, 2020), procyanidins (Mannozzi et al., 2018) improve certain parameters for the storage time of apples, pomegranate arils, blueberry, mango, litchi fruit.

        <p>The effectiveness of chitosan active antioxidant films has been evaluated in meat products as well. Moradi, Tajik, Razavi Rohani, and Oromiehie (2011) has observed that in mortadella sausages packaged by neat chitosan films during refrigerated storage exhibited a rapid increase in thiobarbituric acid (used to measure the lipid oxidation) like control samples without film. However, oxidation in the samples wrapped with chitosan films formulated with grape seed extract and Zataria multiflora Boiss essential oil rapidly decreased during first 6 days (Moradi et al., 2011). Thyme, cloves, prickly ash, fennel, geranium, and cinnamon extracts on chitosan-based films have been evaluated to prolong the shelf-life of refrigerated pork. The results reflect that after 7 days the active film allows decreasing the total viable count of bacteria and effectively preventing the meat discoloration (Liu et al., 2021). Besides, active chitosan films enriched with syringic acid exert a preservative effect on quail eggs, observing a slower decrease of the weight loss rate, yolk index and Haugh unit values than those of the uncoated eggs (Yang et al., 2019).The effectiveness of chitosan active antioxidant films has been evaluated in meat products as well.

        <p>The additional antimicrobial properties of many of these tested oils have shown a growth inhibitory effect of certain pathogenic microorganisms such as L. monocytogenes and delays the oxidation of lipids present in these foodstuffs. This desired effect has been observed in cooked cured ham (Thymus moroderi and Thymus piperella essential oil) (Ruiz-Navajas et al., 2015), pork (cinnamon and ginger essential oils) (Wang, Wang, et al., 2017), sliced sausage (Eucalyptus globulus essential oil) (Azadbakht et al., 2018) and mortadella sausages (Zataria multiflora and grape seed extract) (Moradi et al., 2011). The improvement of the chemical properties of chicken burger and delayed lipid oxidation have been reached by the application of chitosan/anise (Pimpinella anisum L.) essential oil films (Mahdavi et al., 2018).The additional antimicrobial properties of many of these tested oils have shown a growth inhibitory effect of certain pathogenic microorganisms such as L. monocytogenes and delays the oxidation of lipids present in these foodstuffs.

        <p>The growth inhibition of L. monocytogenes and the antioxidant effect of active chitosan films have also been studied in fishery products such as minced trout fillet (red grape seed extract and Ziziphora clinopodioides essential oil) (Kakaei &amp; Shahbazi, 2016) and grass carp fillets (apple polyphenols) (Sun et al., 2018). In these cases, the application of the films led to a delay in the oxidation of lipids and proteins present in the food. In peeled shrimp, there was a decrease in the total bacterial count of bacteria, such as L. monocytogenes when applying the active chitosan/gelatin film (Mohebi &amp; Shahbazi, 2017). The application of chitosan/ginger essential oil films on Barracuda fish improve the moisture barrier properties and the antimicrobial effect against psychotropic and mesophilic bacteria (Remya et al., 2016). Chitosan films with microcapsules of grape seed extract and carvacrol have showed beneficial effects on fresh salmon fillets, maintaining the luminosity values closer to those of fresh salmon and lower total volatile basic nitrogen, pH and bacterial counts for a longer period of time (Alves et al., 2018).The growth inhibition of L. monocytogenes and the antioxidant effect of active chitosan films have also been studied in fishery products such as minced trout fillet (red grape seed extract and Ziziphora clinopodioides essential oil) (Kakaei &amp; Shahbazi, 2016) and grass carp fillets (apple polyphenols) (Sun et al., 2018).

        <p>In active chitosan films where antimicrobial effect is exerted, studies on foodstuffs are very varied. For instance, butter cake (Sangsuwan, Rattanapanone, &amp; Pongsirikul, 2015) was studied, resulting in a tripling of the shelf-life of the product when chitosan film was applied with vanilla and potassium sorbate (Sangsuwan et al., 2015). Chitosan/apricot (Prunus armeniaca) kernel essential oil films have shown no fungal growth on bread slides after 10 days, being this type of food highly vulnerable to Rhizopus stolonifera (Priyadarshi, Sauraj, Kumar, &amp; Negi, 2018).In active chitosan films where antimicrobial effect is exerted, studies on foodstuffs are very varied.

        <p>Restructured chicken has been studied, and the use of chitosan films resulted in a significantly lower counts of psychotropic microorganisms than in those treated without active film (Serrano-León et al., 2018). Also, microbial spoilage in these samples decreased significantly compared to the control sample (Mahdavi et al., 2018). Chitosan-Thymus vulgaris essential oil films has been designed for the shelf-life extension of ready-to-eat meat products. The presence of Thymus vulgaris essential oil reduced yeast populations, whereas aerobic mesophilic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria, and enterobacteria have not been affected. Meat color preservation and the moisture condensation are enhanced in the presence of Thymus vulgaris essential oil, giving a better appearance to the packaged meat (Quesada, Sendra, Navarro, &amp; Sayas-Barberá, 2016). Wrapping of cooked ham samples with chitosan/basil encapsulated essential oil films have been find to decrease mainly the growth of aerobic mesophilic bacteria and the enhancement of food pH for 10 days of the storage time analysis (Amor et al., 2021). The same antimicrobial effect has been produced in fresh pasta, where the application of chestnut extract to the chitosan films generated a process of retrogradation of the pasta, allowing it to maintain a hard texture after 9 days of conservation in the film (Kõrge, Bajić, Likozar, &amp; Novak, 2020).Restructured chicken has been studied, and the use of chitosan films resulted in a significantly lower counts of psychotropic microorganisms than in those treated without active film (Serrano-León et al., 2018).

        <p>On the other hand, it was studied the O 2 scavenging capacity of active chitosan films applied on ground meat, where an increase in the shelf life of 5-6 days was obtained (Chounou et al., 2013). Other authors studied the same effect on active chitosan films applied on sliced sukuk, where a delay in the deterioration of the color of the meat product was also observed due to the O 2 scavenger (S ¸ahin, Çarkcıoglu, Demirhan, &amp; Candogan, 2017).On the other hand, it was studied the O 2 scavenging capacity of active chitosan films applied on ground meat, where an increase in the shelf life of 5-6 days was obtained (Chounou et al., 2013).

        <p>Chitosan has been evaluated as raw material for intelligent films as Table 5 summarizes. Intelligent pH indicator films are used to monitor the freshness of foodstuffs. The indicator changes the color when the pH of the product changes. In this way, consumers can immediately see whether the food they are about to eat is in good condition. Intelligent pH-indicator chitosan-based films have been extensively studied over the last few years. Numerous studies have been carried out on fishery products. For instance, the effect of the addition of alizarin to chitosan film was studied in fish. It was observed that the color of the film changed vividly from slightly yellow to purple upon a pH change in the range 4-10 (Ezati &amp; Rhim, 2020). The application of butterfly pudding extract caused a color change in chitosan films from purple-blue to dark green during fish preservation (Yan et al., 2021). Other added extracts, but in this case from red cabbage, resulted in a change of the film color from light blue to yellow after 7 days of storage. This indicates that pH changes have been detected and thus contamination of the fish fillets occurred (Silva-Pereira, Teixeira, Pereira-Júnior, &amp; Stefani, 2015). A pH-sensitive chitosan-based film with dyes extract from the flower of Bauhinia blakeana Dunn has been also applied as a sticker sensor to test the freshness and pH changes of fish (Zhang, Lu, &amp; Chen, 2014). This resulted in a change from purple to green as volatile amines are released from the feed (Zhang et al., 2014).Chitosan has been evaluated as raw material for intelligent films as Table 5 summarizes.

        <p>As for the meat products, a chitosan/black and purple rice extract samples have been developed, from which it is possible to determine the pH change in the pork samples studied (Yang et al., 2019). Results indicated that chitosan-purple rice extracts is more suitable for controlling the deterioration of the pork than chitosan-black rice extract, due to the moderate anthocyanin content (Yang et al., 2019). The chitosan, poly(vinyl alcohol), and anthocyanin extracted from red cabbage has been cast to serve as a wrapper for pork belly slices. The film turns yellowish with a pale green color when in a slightly alkaline range (Vo &amp; Dang, 2019). The sensitive chitosan-Bauhinia blakeana Dunn film also successfully works to detect contamination of pork meat (Zhang et al., 2014). It was observed that after 48 h, the color of the detection film changes from brown to green, indicating an obvious pH change in the sample (Zhang et al., 2014).As for the meat products, a chitosan/black and purple rice extract samples have been developed, from which it is possible to determine the pH change in the pork samples studied (Yang et al., 2019).

        <p>Studies were also conducted on dairy products. Cellulose-chitosan films with the addition of carrot anthocyanins demonstrated that they could be used as a food grade biomaterial to control the freshness and spoilage of milk (Ebrahimi Tirtashi et al., 2019). After 48 h of storage at 20 • C, a color change from blue to purplish-pink can be observed. Similar results were obtained by chitosan-purple and black eggplant extracts films, where after 10 h of storage at 40 • C, the milk acidified promote the color change from light blue to dark blue. Specifically, black eggplant extract has showed a more significant color alteration (Yang et al., 2019). The cream cheese was also evaluated, where the chitosan/Melissa officinalis essences/Pomegranate peel extract film, as the time and temperature of the cheese increased, the samples became acidic and this pH change resulted in a color change from blue to red (Pirsa et al., 2020).Studies were also conducted on dairy products.

        <p>In the literature, the main studies about intelligent packaging based on chitosan, usually use anthocyanins to develop indifferently temperature and freshness indicators. A chitosan-based film with anthocyanins from Jambolana fruit that shows changes from red to blue when used to monitor the freshness of shrimp at temperatures between -20 • C and 20 • C has been developed (Merz et al., 2020). In meat products, a similar material with anthocyanins from fruit and sweet potato have been tested on meat samples under three different temperatures (-20, 4 and 20 • C) for 72 h (Capello et al., 2020). From the color change of the film from red to blue, it can be concluded that meats stored at 4 • C and 20 • C are considered as contaminated after 72 h and 24 h, respectively. Anthocyanins from roselle have been evaluated to control pork meat. A yellowish pigmentation of the film is generated as contamination of the meat begin to occur (Zhang, Zou, et al., 2019).In the literature, the main studies about intelligent packaging based on chitosan, usually use anthocyanins to develop indifferently temperature and freshness indicators.

        <p>Studies have been carried out on pasteurized milk as well. The red cabbage anthocyanins in chitosan-samples turn from grey to dark pink when the milk is contaminated. This color change occurs when the milk reaches a pH value of 4.6, after being subjected to temperatures above refrigeration for time intervals ranging from 0 to 4 days (Pereira, de Arruda, &amp; Stefani, 2015). Purple tomato anthocyanins have been studied on milk. In this case, the film color changes from green to pink, after a decrease in pH from 6.8 to 5.0 is generated after 48 h of storage (Li et al., 2021). The same authors have studied what effect these same films would have on fish samples. The film turns from dark green to light green. Fish samples stored after 48 h generate biogenic amines, which increase the pH of the product (Li et al., 2021). Seafood (pomfret fish and shrimp) spoilage has been monitored with chitosan-films enriched with oxidized chitin nanocrystals and black rice bran anthocyanins. The films show a color change from purple to blue-grey after 24 h of storage due to the increase of total volatile basic nitrogen in the packaging film (Wu et al., 2019).Studies have been carried out on pasteurized milk as well.
