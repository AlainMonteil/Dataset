        <p>The industrial Haber-Bosch process to produce ammonia (NH3) from dinitrogen (N2) is crucial for modern society. However, N2 activation is inherently challenging and the Haber-Bosch process has significant drawbacks, as it is highly energy intensive, not sustainable due to substantial CO2 emissions primarily from the generation of H2 and requires large-centralized facilities. New strategies of sustainable N2 activation, such as low-temperature thermochemical catalysis and (photo)electrocatalysis, have been pursued, but progress has been hindered by the lack of rigor and reproducibility in the collection and analysis of results.The industrial Haber-Bosch process to produce ammonia (NH3) from dinitrogen (N2) is crucial for modern society.

        <p>In this Primer, we provide a holistic step-by-step protocol, applicable to all nitrogen-transformation reactions, focused on verifying genuine N2 activation by accounting for all contamination sources. We compare state-of-the-art results from different catalytic reactions following the protocol's framework, and discuss necessary reporting metrics and ways to interpret both experimental and density functional theory results. This Primer covers various common pitfalls in the field, best practices to improve reproducibility and cost-efficient methods to carry out rigorous experimentation. The future of nitrogen catalysis will require an increase in rigorous experimentation and standardization to prevent false positives from appearing in the literature, which can enable advancing towards practical technologies for the activation of N2.In this Primer, we provide a holistic step-by-step protocol, applicable to all nitrogen-transformation reactions, focused on verifying genuine N2 activation by accounting for all contamination sources.

        <p>Nitrogen is essential to all forms of life and constitutes ~78 % of air in the form of dinitrogen (N2). However, the formidable strength of the N≡N triple bond (bond dissociation energy of 9.80 eV per bond at 298 K) 1 makes N2 fixation into biologically-available forms extremely difficult 2 . N2 fixation in nature occurs in two ways. Lightning can convert N2 in air to nitrous oxides (NOx) 3 . More dominantly, nitrogenase enzymes can catalyse N2 reduction to ammonia (NH3) by a multi-electron transfer process. The other process involves the hydrolysis of at least 16 equivalents of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to produce 2 molecules of NH3 and at least 1 molecule of dihydrogen (H2), alongside adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and phosphate (Pi) release (N2 + 8 H + + 8 e -+ 16ATP → 2 NH3 + H2 + 16ADP + 16 Pi) 4 . This system performs at up to 65% selectivity to NH3 at 1 atm N2 in the absence of N2O [REF 4,5 ]. Yet, biological N2 fixation is kinetically slow due to reliance on electron tunnelling 6 and is insufficient to sustain intensive modern agricultural practices 7 .Nitrogen is essential to all forms of life and constitutes ~78 % of air in the form of dinitrogen (N2).

        <p>Prior to industrial production of NH3 by the Haber-Bosch process, natural fertilizers came in the form of caliche from Chile and guano from Peru 8 . In 1898, Sir William Crookes deemed mass starvation to be the biggest challenge of the 20 th century 9 , instigating the burgeoning interest in industrial N2 activation. In 1903, the Birkeland-Eyde process became commercial 7 , utilizing electric arcs to fix atmospheric N2 into nitric acid (HNO3), based on a method used by Henry Cavendish in 1784 10 . In 1908, Fritz Haber managed to synthesize NH3 from N2 and H2 (N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇋ 2NH3(g), ΔG˚ = -32.9 kJmol -1 (REF 11 ), eq. 1) on a table-top machine, but it suffered from remarkably slow kinetics under standard temperature and pressure 8 . To boost the formation rate of NH3 and tilt the equilibrium, Haber increased both temperature and pressure over an Os catalyst 7 . Subsequently, BASF bought the invention and Carl Bosch up-scaled the production in 1913 7 to the currently known Haber-Bosch process, which operates at 400-450 o C and 150-250 bar over a multipromoted fused Fe catalyst 12 . This system can be referred to as Gen 1 (Fig. 1) and is currently the main commercially available process for NH3 synthesis. A more active Ru-based supported catalyst was later developed, but it was not as widely adopted due to drawbacks such as high cost and low stability 13 . Gerhard Ertl elucidated the molecular mechanistic details of the catalytic N2 reduction to NH3 over Fe, enriching the understanding of the system 14 , for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize in 2007 (Fig. 1). Industrial NH3 production by the Haber-Bosch process is the backbone of modern society and is responsible for the population boom in the 20 th century [15][16][17] . Current annual NH3 production exceeds 170 million metric tonnes 18 (Mt) globally, of which ~80 % is used as synthetic fertilizer 19 , thereby providing sustenance for two-fifths of the global population 20 . Moreover, NH3 is the source of every N atom in all synthetic chemicals 21 , a key reactant in the chemical industry 22 and a potential hydrogen energy carrier 23,24 . However, NH3 production from the Haber-Bosch process is energy and emission intensive. Nearly all the required energy and emissions in NH3 production originate from the generation of H2, most commonly from natural gas via steam-methane reforming 25 (0.75CH4(g) + 1.5H2O(l) ⇋ 3H2(g) + 0.75CO2(g), ΔG˚ = +98.0 kJmol -1 (REF 11 ), eq. 2). For the methane-fed process, NH3 production has a theoretical minimum energy input of 22.2 GJtNH3 -1 with the stoichiometric emission of 1.2 tCO2tNH3 -1 (REF 12 ). In comparison, modern NH3 production plants using the best available technology consume 28-33 GJtNH3 -1 and emit 1.6 tCO2tNH3 -1 (REF 12,25 ), but the global average is 2.9 tCO2tNH3 -1 (REF 26 ) owing to the use of coal and oil-based feedstocks 12 . The annual global NH3 production (&gt;170 Mt) consumes about 1% of total world energy production and emits 1.4% of global CO2 emissions 18,25,27 . Implementation of CO2 sequestration processes or other carbon offsets can reduce emissions but will add cost, plant complexity and energy losses 28 .Prior to industrial production of NH3 by the Haber-Bosch process, natural fertilizers came in the form of caliche from Chile and guano from Peru 8 .

In contrast, Ru(0001) step sites adsorb N2 more strongly than terrace sites and the thermodynamic barrier at the step sites for *N2 to *N2H is much lower (~0.35 eV) as a result of stronger adsorption on a more undercoordinated site. In addition, the process can be understood commonly via a dissociative mechanism [58][59][60] , where N2 is cleaved upon adsorption into atomic N, and then hydrogenated to release NH3. Although the dissociation of N2 to 2*N is thermodynamically favored, this step has a significant activation barrier, and occurs only at step sites as a result of the prohibitively high activation barrier for N2 dissociation on terrace sites 61,62 . Experimentally, the apparent activation barrier on a clean Ru(0001) single crystal (containing step site density of ~1%) is 0.4 eV and increases to 1.3 eV when small amounts of Au, which preferentially decorate step sites, is introduced, which demonstrates that the rate of N2 dissociation is completely dominated by steps 62 . It is worth noting that an activation energy found from the Arrhenius plot corresponds to the potential energy barrier that only captures the enthalpy term. Thus, to evaluate the free energy of activation (displayed in Fig. 2a), the energy associated with the loss of gas phase entropy of N2 as it is bound on the surface has to be included (see Creating free energy diagrams under Results for further details). Moreover, there are also significant uphill steps for the reduction of *NH2 to NH3(g) (step 6-8) at the step sites on Ru(0001), signifying the cost of creating free sites. The apparent activation energy is the sum of both the activation energy of the rate-limiting step and the cost of making free sites in a non-trivial manner 61,63 ; this is the origin of the Sabatier principle.[H2] Origin to N2 activation challenges Activating N2 by reduction to make NH3 is kinetically difficult, which demands much more energy than what is needed thermodynamically to drive reactions at high rates to make these processes economical. 57 , which linearly correlates the activation barriers to the reaction energies.

        <p>The difficulty of finding catalysts with fast kinetics for N2 fixation can be explained by the "scaling relations" 69 , where the energetics of different elementary steps (Fig. 2a) cannot be controlled independently on a given surface. Such scaling relations can be manifested in the volcano dependence of catalytic activity on the adsorption energy of surface reaction intermediates. For example, the catalyst activity, computed via the mean-field kinetic model [G] of the dissociative mechanism, exhibits a volcano dependence on the N adsorption energy (Fig. 2b, circle, red) 69 . On the right side of the volcano N2 dissociation is rate-limiting for weak-binding surfaces, and on the left side there is a low barrier for N2 dissociation for strong-binding surfaces, but the surface is poisoned by N species.

More importantly, electrochemical N2 reduction in aqueous electrolytes has to compete with electrochemical H2 evolution as both reactions have similar standard potentials and electron energy on the absolute energy scale (Fig. 2a). This competition is a disadvantage, as the kinetics of water reduction to produce H2 is much faster than that reduction of N2 to NH3, as seen in the comparatively lower overpotential for H2 evolution (Fig. 2b, blue, triangle), translating to many orders of magnitude difference in the estimated rate (Fig. 2b). In addition, the bond strength of any given metal surface to H (a sole intermediate of H2 evolution) is stronger and linearly correlates with Ncontaining intermediates of N2 reduction 32 , which indicates that the surface will be poisoned by *H 75 and is likely responsible for negligible NH3 reported in aqueous systems 76,77 . Although a study on wider N2 electrooxidation trends has yet to be reported, a similar scaling relation between the reactant activation and subsequent hydroxylation or desorption steps is expected, as well as scaling with *O2 intermediates of the competing O2 evolution.Scaling relations also constrain electrochemical N2 reduction.

        <p>If both criteria are met, repeated testing is necessary with independently prepared samples to confirm reproducibility. If these criteria were not met, the measured yield of product might stem from contamination, and further evidence of product synthesis via quantifiable isotope-labelling experiments is necessary. First, one must test using an inert gas (such as Ar, although any clean inert gas can be used) and test N2 in the absence of a driving force. These conditions can range from operating an open circuit potential for electrochemical systems, analysis under dark illumination for photo(electro)chemical systems or in the absence of applied heat for thermochemical systems. Operating under these driving force-free conditions is essential to account for sources of contamination in the experimental set-up, as this should give significantly less to no product compared to N2 with a driving force. Repeated identical testing of independently prepared batches also follows to ascertain reproducibility and determine the level of inherent contamination (if any) in the system. A stability test is also needed to eliminate the possibility of noncatalytic generation of the product, such as N-leaching from an N-containing catalyst.

        <p>Electrochemical measurements are typically conducted in a cell setup as depicted in Fig. 4a, into which gas streams are introduced. Feed gases (Ar, 14 N2, and 15 N2) must be cleaned prior to use as they can contain significant amounts of activated N-species (such as NH3, NOx and N2O) as contaminants 97,102 .

        <p>Chronopotentiometric (CP) and/or chronoamperometric (CA) measurements show the stability of the system over time, and representative data for these should be reported, with a description of whether Ohmic correction [G] is utilized. When probing the potential across the electrochemical interface in question, an iR-correction, based on the pre-or post-testing ohmic drop, is generally encouraged as it can eliminate the system-dependent effects, such as electrolyte conductivity and electrode geometry. However, such correction must be done with caution especially if the ohmic drop varies during testing owing to factors such as bubble formation, rising electrolyte levels, temperature variation, build-up of non-conducting phases observed in the Li-mediated process, among others. In such cases, the potential should be reported as a range of values rather than a single point. Once the synthesized product is detected, the product yield and Faradaic efficiency can be calculated as a function of potential vs RHE, enabling the determination of the optimum for each of these factors in the system. Moreover, the difference between the operating potential and the equilibrium voltage approximates the overpotential, a critical figure-of-merit. The overpotential for N2 reduction to NH3(g) is independent of pH and the electrolyte. The Nernstian shift in the equilibrium potential occurs due to a change in product and reagent concentrations that affect the overall pH of the solution, and can be taken into account via the actual amount of NH3 produced. Relative to standard conditions, the equilibrium concentration of NH3(aq) or NH4 + (aq) can be determined by thermodynamic data (solvation energy) or measured directly via NMR 110 . At pH = 0, the difference between the standard equilibrium potential N2(g)/NH4 + (aq) is 0.27 V vs RHE, though at pH = 14, the standard equilibrium potential of N2(g)/NH3(aq) is ~0.1 V vs RHE 11 . However, this Nernstian shift is insignificant when there is a large overpotential for N2 reduction, such as the case for non-aqueous lithium-mediated NH3 synthesis.Chronopotentiometric (CP) and/or chronoamperometric (CA) measurements show the stability of the system over time, and representative data for these should be reported, with a description of whether Ohmic correction [G] is utilized. When probing the potential across the electrochemical interface in question, an iR-correction, based on the pre-or post-testing ohmic drop, is generally encouraged as it can eliminate the system-dependent effects, such as electrolyte conductivity and electrode geometry. However, such correction must be done with caution especially if the ohmic drop varies during testing owing to factors such as bubble formation, rising electrolyte levels, temperature variation, build-up of non-conducting phases observed in the Li-mediated process, among others. In such cases, the potential should be reported as a range of values rather than a single point. Once the synthesized product is detected, the product yield and Faradaic efficiency can be calculated as a function of potential vs RHE, enabling the determination of the optimum for each of these factors in the system.

        <p>Thermochemical measurements are usually conducted in a fixed-bed flow system as shown in Fig. 4b, where the catalyst is loaded into the reactor and pretreated under specified conditions. The reactant gases (N2 and H2) are passed over the catalyst bed with a certain space velocity, such that the reaction rates are not limited by gas transport. The reactant gases may need purification by in-line gas purifiers to reduce the content of impurities (for example, H2O, O2, CO2) to sub-ppm level, as these might affect the surface of the active catalyst by poisoning the available active sites. The measurements should be conducted under steadystate conditions as a function of temperature and pressure. The produced NH3 is typically trapped in a downstream diluted sulfuric acid solution, which is then quantified by using ion chromatography or a conductivity meter. The related parameters (such as NH3 synthesis rate and yield) can be obtained once the amount of produced NH3 is determined.Thermochemical measurements are usually conducted in a fixed-bed flow system as shown in Fig. 4b, where the catalyst is loaded into the reactor and pretreated under specified conditions.

The activity of titania is highly dependent on supplier, which has been attributed to differences in oxygen vacancy abundance 142 or carbon contaminants 143 . Nonetheless, there is an increasing number of reports of photochemical N2 fixation on titania and numerous other materials 64,116 . Literature results in photochemical N2 fixation must be viewed in the context of experimental rigour, which not only includes mere isotope labelling experiments but also tangible efforts to account for contamination sources, including the elimination of 15 NH3 and 15 NOx impurities in gas streams. The necessity of isotope-labelled experiments is a consequence of the inherent measurement challenges, similar to those within electrochemical systems.

At 0 K, the free energy consists of the energy obtained from DFT and the zero point energy [G]. The temperature-dependent free energy includes additional contributions from enthalpy and entropy, which can be computed through statistical mechanics (this standard DFT textbook 164 describes how each term is calculated). The entropy can be computed by assuming the adsorbate acts as a harmonic oscillator as an approximate upper bound. This assumption can lead to over-estimation in the case of low-frequency modes because the entropy diverges as frequency goes to zero for a harmonic oscillator, calling the need for rigorous treating and reporting of low-frequency modes 165 . Compared to the DFT energies, the inclusion of all free energy terms generally causes surface states to be less favorable due to the vibrational energy of the adsorbed states and the loss of entropy as they are bound to the surface. The entropy loss of a gaseous reactant as it becomes bound on the surface needs to be accounted for when in evaluating the free energy barrier 164 (Fig. 2a). The importance of the full consideration of all free energy terms is more concretely illustrated in Fig. 9a. The *N2H surface species gains 0.16 eV to be adsorbed on Ru (211) when considering only the DFT energy (grey). However, this *N2H surface species is destabilized by 0.67 eV due to the entropy loss relative to the gas phase and by 0.16 eV owing to change in the zero-point energy of the bonds (while it is stabilized by 0.05 eV from the enthalpy change), all leading to an energy penalty of +0.62 eV for *N2H adsorption.

To this end, performing complete isotope-labelling experiments, with time-dependent product quantification and proper cleaning of the 15 N2 gas stream, is imperative to ensure unambiguous certainty of successful N2 fixation. Additional rigor needs to be applied when performing electrochemical and photo(electro)chemical measurements and detecting product formation from these processes, especially when the reported selectivity is very low. For electrochemical measurements, the pre-and post-test Ohmic resistance can differ substantially (See Experimentation) such that the shift in potential should be properly adjusted 76 .

        <p>The non-aqueous Li-mediated N2 reduction process is proven to work, achieving record high energy efficiencies [79][80][81][82] . However, a vast majority of the reported literature still remains focused on aqueous systems (Fig. 6), which is most likely due to the numerous experimental challenges for non-aqueous systems, such as Ohmic drop compensation and high over-potentials, evaporation of organic solvents, compatibility of colorimetric methods, etc. Furthermore, this system has significant kinetic challenges due to mass-transport limitations that need to be overcome, which is possible with the use of GDEs in flowcell type systems (see Limitations and Optimizations). Further research in these systems would enable scientists to tackle these challenges as breakthroughs occur, thereby increasing the feasibility of the system for practical commercial use.The non-aqueous Li-mediated N2 reduction process is proven to work, achieving record high energy efficiencies [79][80][81][82] .
