        <p>Bimetallic Pd-Fe catalysts supported on TiO 2 are shown to be highly effective toward the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde via the in situ production of H 2 O 2 from molecular H 2 and O 2 , under conditions where no reaction is observed with molecular O 2 alone. The rate of benzyl alcohol oxidation observed over supported Pd-Fe nanoparticles is significantly higher than those of either Pd-Au or Pd-only analogues. This enhanced activity can be attributed to the bifunctionality of the Pd-Fe catalyst to both synthesize H 2 O 2 and catalyze the production of oxygen-based radical specie,s as indicated by an electron paramagnetic resonance analysis. Further studies also reveal the noninnocent nature of the solvent, resulting in the propagation of radical generation pathways.Bimetallic Pd-Fe catalysts supported on TiO 2 are shown to be highly effective toward the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde via the in situ production of H 2 O 2 from molecular H 2 and O 2 , under conditions where no reaction is observed with molecular O 2 alone.

        <p>The oxidation of benzyl alcohol (Scheme 1) is an often-used model reaction for the selective oxidation of alcohols, due in part to the limited number of products and the relatively wellknown pathways to their formation. 1 Beyond its use as a model system, the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to the corresponding aldehyde is of great importance in its own right, with the latter finding use in the perfumery, dyestuff, and agrochemical industries. 2 Typically, benzyl alcohol oxidation is carried out on an industrial scale using costly stoichiometric oxidants such as dichromate, chromic acid, and permanganate. 3 However, there are concerns around atom inefficiency and the production of large quantities of undesirable, often toxic, byproducts requiring removal from product streams prior to shipping. 4 Consequently, there is growing interest in the application of benign oxidants, such as molecular oxygen and air, through which high yields of benzaldehyde can be achieved, although typically the use of elevated reaction temperatures, in the range of 100 °C, is required. [5][6][7][8][9][10] By comparison, the use of commercial hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) as an oxidant has been shown to allow significantly lower reaction temperatures to be utilized. With a range of precious- [11][12][13] and nonpreciousmetal [14][15][16][17][18] catalysts having been studied, the catalytic generation of oxygen-based radical species is widely reported to be a key step in the oxidation mechanism, with the proton abstraction of the alcohol moiety (PhCH 2 OH) being crucial in the formation of the aldehyde. 18,19 Nevertheless, a number of drawbacks associated with the use of commercial H 2 O 2 exist, namely those associated with the anthraquinone (AO) process, the means by which the vast majority (∼95%) of H 2 O 2 is produced on an industrial scale. Although highly efficient, the AO process is only economically viable when it is operated at a large scale, necessitating the centralization of production. Because of this, H 2 O 2 is typically transported at concentrations in excess of 70 wt % prior to dilution at point of final use, effectively wasting a significant proportion of energy used in the distillation and concentration process. Furthermore, the low stability of H 2 O 2 and its tendency to undergo rapid decomposition at relatively mild temperatures require the use of stabilizing agents such as acetic acid 20 and phosphoric acid. 21 While the use of such additives inevitably results in additional cost to the end user, due to reactor corrosion, catalytic instability, and the need for stabilizer removal from product streams.The oxidation of benzyl alcohol (Scheme 1) is an often-used model reaction for the selective oxidation of alcohols, due in part to the limited number of products and the relatively wellknown pathways to their formation. 1 Beyond its use as a model system, the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to the corresponding aldehyde is of great importance in its own right, with the latter finding use in the perfumery, dyestuff, and agrochemical industries. 2 Typically, benzyl alcohol oxidation is carried out on an industrial scale using costly stoichiometric oxidants such as dichromate, chromic acid, and permanganate. 3 However, there are concerns around atom inefficiency and the production of large quantities of undesirable, often toxic, byproducts requiring removal from product streams prior to shipping. 4 Consequently, there is growing interest in the application of benign oxidants, such as molecular oxygen and air, through which high yields of benzaldehyde can be achieved, although typically the use of elevated reaction temperatures, in the range of 100 °C, is required.

        <p>In principle, the in situ synthesis of H 2 O 2 directly from H 2 and O 2 for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol would avoid the numerous drawbacks associated with the use of preformed H 2 O 2 , while also allowing for the application of lower reaction temperatures. Indeed, the activation of molecular O 2 through a reaction with H 2 and the in situ generation of oxygen-based hydroperoxyl (-OOH) and hydroxyl (-OH) species has been previously demonstrated to yield appreciable concentrations of benzaldehyde, 8,22 with a similar approach having been reported for the selective oxidation of salicylic acid. 23 The use of supported AuPd nanoparticles has been reported to offer far greater efficacy in comparison to Pd-only analogues for a range of reactions, including the aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol and the direct synthesis of H 2 O 2 . [24][25][26][27] Furthermore, AuPd alloys have also been demonstrated to catalyze the in situ oxidation of benzyl alcohol, with high selectivities (&gt;85%) toward benzaldehyde being typical, at temperatures where no reaction is observed using only molecular O 2 . However, conversion rates are often far below those widely reported when O 2 or air is used as an oxidant. 8 With these previous studies in mind, we have investigated a range of bifunctional Pd-based catalysts, focusing on nonprecious alloying metals to reduce costs, for the in situ oxidation of benzyl alcohol utilizing H 2 and O 2 under reaction conditions where limited activity is observed with molecular O 2 and at temperatures considerably lower than those of the current industrial means of production. 28 ■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Catalyst Preparation. Mono-and bi-metallic 1% Pd-X/ TiO 2 catalysts (where Pd:X = 1:1 and X = Au, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Ni, Ce) have been prepared (on a weight basis) by an excess chloride impregnation procedure, based on a methodology previously reported in the literature. 29 This method has been shown to result in an enhanced dispersion of metals, in particular Au, in comparison to conventional impregnation procedures. The procedure to produce 0.5% Au-0.5% Pd/ TiO 2 (2 g) is outlined below, with a similar methodology being utilized for all mono-and bimetallic catalysts, using chloridebased metal precursors in all cases. The requisite amount of metal precursors used for the synthesis of the mono-and bimetallic catalysts is reported in Table S1.In principle, the in situ synthesis of H 2 O 2 directly from H 2 and O 2 for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol would avoid the numerous drawbacks associated with the use of preformed H 2 O 2 , while also allowing for the application of lower reaction temperatures.

Hydrogen peroxide synthesis activity was evaluated using a Parr Instruments stainless steel autoclave with a nominal volume of 50 mL and a maximum working pressure of 14 MPa. To test each catalyst for H 2 O 2 synthesis, the autoclave was charged with the catalyst (0.01 g), the solvent (5.6 g methanol, HPLC grade, Fisher Scientific) and H 2 O (2.9 g, HPLC grade, Fisher Scientific). The charged autoclave was then purged three times with 5% H 2 /CO 2 (0.7 MPa) before filling with 5% H 2 /CO 2 to a pressure of 2.9 MPa, followed by the addition of 25% O 2 /CO 2 (1.1 MPa). The reaction mixture was stirred (1200 rpm) for 0.5 h, with the temperature being maintained at 20 °C. Reactor temperature control was achieved using a HAAKE K50 bath/circulator using an appropriate coolant. The reactor was not continuously supplied with gas. H 2 O 2 productivity was determined by titrating aliquots of the final solution after reaction with acidified Ce(SO 4 ) 2 (0.01 M) in the presence of ferroin indicator.

In all cases reactions were run multiple times, over multiple batches of catalyst, with the data being presented as an average of these experiments. The catalytic activity toward H 2 O 2 synthesis was found to be consistent to within ±4% on the basis of multiple reactions.Note 2.

        <p>Our initial studies investigated the efficacy of a range of TiO 2supported monometallic catalysts, prepared by a co-impregnation procedure, 29 toward the direct synthesis and subsequent degradation of H 2 O 2 . These experiments were carried out under conditions previously optimized to enhance H 2 O 2 stability, namely in the presence of a methanol cosolvent and CO 2 gaseous diluent, both of which have been shown to inhibit H 2 O 2 degradation pathways (Table S4). 24,30 The inactivity of the monometallic catalysts toward the formation of H 2 O 2 is clear, with the exception of the 1% Pd/TiO 2 catalyst (30 mol H2O2 kg cat -1 h -1 ), which was expected, since supported Pd catalysts have been well studied for the direct synthesis of H 2 O 2 . [34][35][36][37][38][39] As with H 2 O 2 synthesis activity, only the 1% Pd/ TiO 2 catalyst was observed to offer any measurable activity toward H 2 O 2 degradation (198 mol H2O2 kg cat -1 h -1 ) via hydrogenation and decomposition pathways. This result is perhaps more unexpected given the well-known activity of a range of these metals, such as Fe, Mn, and Cu, to catalyze H 2 O 2 decomposition to H 2 O 40 and may be ascribed to the in situ formation of carbonic acid, through the dissolution of the CO 2 reactant gas diluent, and resulting stabilization of H 2 O 2 . We have previously reported the effects of CO 2 on catalytic activity to be comparable to those observed when the reaction solution is acidified to pH 4 using HNO 3 . 30 As may have been expected given the limited activity of most of the monometallic catalysts toward H 2 O 2 production, the catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol via the in situ production of H 2 O 2 from H 2 and O 2 was also limited (Figure 1, with H 2 conversion and residual H 2 O 2 being presented in Table S5). Again, the only exception was the 1% Pd/TiO 2 catalyst, which was observed to offer appreciable conversion rates of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde (1.80% product yield). The significant improvement in benzyl alcohol oxidation in the presence of H 2 and O 2 in comparison to that observed when molecular H 2 or O 2 was used alone or when commercial H 2 O 2 was used should also be noted (Figure S1). The limited activity displayed under the purely aerobic conditions used in this work are related to the low reaction temperatures employed, whereas temperatures typically exceeding 80 °C are utilized for aerobic benzyl alcohol oxidation. 7,41,42 In keeping with previous studies investigating both the oxidation of benzyl alcohol using molecular O 2 7,26 and the direct synthesis of H 2 O 2 , 27,43,44 the incorporation of Au into TiO 2 -supported Pd nanoparticles was observed to lead to a significant enhancement in catalytic efficacy toward benzyl alcohol oxidation via in situ H 2 O 2 production (2.80% product yield) (Figure 2), as well as H 2 O 2 synthesis (Table S6). This synergistic effect observed through alloying Au and Pd is often attributed to a combination of electronic modification, 41 with Au acting as an electronic promoter for Pd, and the disruption of contiguous Pd ensembles. 45 By comparison, the introduction of a range of secondary non-precious metals, such as Co and Fe, into a supported Pd catalyst leads only to a minor enhancement in H 2 O 2 synthesis rates, under conditions optimal for H 2 O 2 production, with this being linked to an inhibition in competitive H 2 O 2 degradation reactions in comparison to the 1% Pd/TiO 2 catalyst (Table S6). This observation is in keeping with numerous previous studies which report the beneficial role of alloying Pd with a range of secondary nonprecious metals, including Sn, 46,47 Zn, 48 Ag, 49 Te, 50 Ni, 51,52 Co, 53 and In, 54 with the enhanced catalytic selectivity often being attributed to a reduction in contiguous Pd ensembles and an increased number of isolated Pd sites favorable for H 2 O 2 formation. 46 Interestingly, the introduction of these secondary base metals, and Fe in particular, into supported Pd nanoparticles was observed to lead to a dramatic improvement in catalytic activity toward benzyl alcohol oxidation under in situ conditions. Indeed, the catalytic efficacy of the 1% PdFe/ TiO 2 catalyst (5.60% product yield) far exceeds that observed for the analogous 1% PdAu/TiO 2 catalyst, with near-complete selectivity toward benzaldehyde (96%). The product selectivity based on H 2 and residual H 2 O 2 is summarized in Table S7, with apparent turnover frequencies being given in Table S8. Further studies, comparing the activity of the bimetallic 1% Pd-Fe/TiO 2 catalyst to that of a physical mixture of 1% Pd/TiO 2 and 1% Fe/TiO 2 catalysts, with the total moles of the metal present being consistent with the bimetallic catalyst, indicate the need for both metals to be immobilized on the same crystalline support grain in order to achieve enhanced activity (Table S9).Our initial studies investigated the efficacy of a range of TiO 2supported monometallic catalysts, prepared by a co-impregnation procedure, 29 toward the direct synthesis and subsequent degradation of H 2 O 2 .

        <p>An assessment of catalytic selectivity toward benzaldehyde and H 2 utilization is presented in Table 1. It is apparent that all three catalysts offer similarly high selectivities toward benzaldehyde, typical of their relatively low rates of benzyl alcohol conversion. However, the H 2 selectivity (i.e., H 2 utilized in the in situ oxidation of benzyl alcohol) of the 1% PdFe/TiO 2 catalyst (33% H 2 selectivity) is seen to be far superior to that of either the 1% Pd/TiO 2 (9% H 2 selectivity) or 1% PdAu/TiO 2 (16% H 2 selectivity) analogue, clearly highlighting the beneficial role of Fe incorporation into Pd and to a lesser extent that of adding Au.An assessment of catalytic selectivity toward benzaldehyde and H 2 utilization is presented in Table 1.

        <p>The catalytic selectivity of Pd-based catalysts toward H 2 O 2 is known to be highly dependent on the oxidation state of Pd, with metallic Pd species typically being more active toward H 2 O 2 degradation than analogous Pd 2+ -based catalysts. [55][56][57] More recently a number of studies have reported the enhanced catalytic efficacy of mixed Pd 0 -Pd 2+ domains, in comparison to Pd 0 -or Pd 2+ -rich species, for both the direct synthesis of H 2 O 2 44,58,59 and the aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol. 60 An analysis of our supported Pd-based catalysts via XPS (Table 2 and Figure S2) indicates that despite exposure to a reductive heat treatment (5% H 2 /Ar, 500 °C, 4 h), upon introduction of Fe into a Pd catalyst, a significant proportion of Pd still exists as Pd 2+ (Pd 0 :Pd 2+ = 0.5), while Fe exists as an oxide. On the other hand, Pd is present predominantly in the metallic form in both the 1% Pd/TiO 2 and 1% PdAu/TiO 2 catalysts. It is therefore possible to attribute the enhanced selectivity of the 1% PdFe/TiO 2 catalyst, at least in part, to the formation of domains of mixed Pd oxidation states and a reduction in competitive H 2 O 2 degradation pathways, although it should be noted that the Pd oxidation states of the fresh material is likely not fully representative of those under reaction conditions. The catalytic activity toward H 2 O 2 synthesis, in particular that of monometallic Pd catalysts, is widely reported to be dependent on nanoparticle size, 36,60,61 with additional studies reporting the relationship between this metric and the catalytic efficacy toward benzyl alcohol oxidation under aerobic conditions. 62,63 Indeed, Zhang et al. have reported that an optimal Pd particle size between 3.6 and 4.3 nm exists for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol when molecular O 2 is used as the oxidant. 64 Further detailed studies by Wang et al. 65 have elucidated the role of both geometric and electronic effects in the catalytic performance of supported Pd nanoparticles toward aerobic benzyl alcohol oxidation, with the catalytic activity and selectivity directly related to particle size. An analysis of the Pd-based catalysts by transmission electron microscopy reveals that there is a significant variation in the average metal nanoparticle size with catalyst formulation. In keeping with previous studies, 29 the monometallic catalyst displays Pd particles in the 3-5 nm range, with a mean size of ∼4.1 nm (Figure 3A and Figures S3A,B andS4A). However, there is also evidence from HAADF-STEM imaging experiments for the coexistence of a population of smaller subnanometer Pd-containing clusters (Figure 3A). As determined previously, 24 the alloying of Au with Pd results in an increase in mean particle size, in comparison to the Pd-only analogue. The majority of the supported PdAu particles were found to be in the 4-10 nm size range, with a mean size of 7.9 nm (Figure 3B and Figures S3C andS4B). However, some occasional larger particles, up to approximately 15 nm were also noted to be present (Figure S3D). Elemental STEM-XEDS mapping studies on individual particles, such as those presented in Figure 4A, confirmed that the PdAu particles are well-mixed random alloys, which is in agreement with what would be expected from this catalyst synthesis procedure. 29 In contrast, the 1% PdFe/TiO 2 catalyst displays a bimodal size distribution with much of the metal being present as small 1 nm clusters either isolated on the titania surface (Figure 3D) or decorating the surface of larger 10-20 nm metallic particles (Figure 3C and Figure S4C). XEDS elemental mapping studies (Figure 4B) confirm that these larger particles are in fact PdFe alloys. These decorated alloyed particles were relatively few in number and were very sparsely distributed over the support (Figure S3E,F). Our XEDS analysis of the smaller clusters revealed that they also contain both Fe and Pd (see inset spectra in Figure 3D). Time-on-line studies comparing the catalytic efficacy of the Pd-based catalysts can be seen in Figure 5 (additional data are presented in Figure S5A-C). As with our standard reaction time studies (0.5 h), the higher catalytic activity of the 1% PdFe/TiO 2 catalyst is once again clear, with a product yield of 7.3% achieved over a time period of 2 h, which is significantly greater than that of either the 1% PdAu/TiO 2 (3.7% product yield) or 1% Pd/TiO 2 (1.8% product yield) analogue, when tested over the same reaction time. The selectivity toward benzaldehyde appears to be consistent for all three catalysts, indicating that the subsequent reactions, including the production of toluene and benzoic acid, are suppressed. This is perhaps unsurprising given the previous studies by Sankar et al. 66 and Partenheimer, 67 who reported that the presence of benzyl alcohol and a range of other alcohols (although notably not methanol, which is the solvent used in this study) even at low concentrations can inhibit the further oxidation of benzaldehyde. It should be noted that the 1% PdFe/TiO 2 catalyst displays a rate of conversion under identical reaction conditions comparable to that of the 5% PdAu/TiO 2 catalyst previously reported by Santonastaso et al., 8 despite having a 10 times lower precious metal content.The catalytic selectivity of Pd-based catalysts toward H 2 O 2 is known to be highly dependent on the oxidation state of Pd, with metallic Pd species typically being more active toward H 2 O 2 degradation than analogous Pd 2+ -based catalysts.

        <p>A comparison of initial reaction rates (Table 3), at a short reaction time (5 min) where there is assumed to be no limitations associated with reactant gas availability, further highlights the increased activity of the 1% PdFe/TiO 2 catalyst. The rate of benzyl alcohol conversion over the 1% PdFe/TiO 2 catalyst was found to be 3.8 times greater than that observed for the 1% Pd/TiO 2 catalyst and 1.3 times greater than that of the analogous bimetallic 1% PdAu/TiO 2 catalyst. It should also be noted that, for all of the catalysts studied, the initial rate of the reaction is far greater than the overall rate. Santonastaso et al. 8 have previously investigated the efficacy of a 5% PdAu/TiO 2 catalyst for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol under reaction conditions similar to those used in this study, with a plateau in benzyl alcohol conversion being reported after relatively short reaction times (20 min), this loss of activity being attributed to catalyst deactivation. In our work, we observed a similar plateau in benzyl alcohol conversion rate over the three catalysts that we chose to study in detail. The H 2 conversion rates over the three catalysts were seen to be particularly high, being approximately 80% over 2 h on-stream (Table S10). These observations are indicative of the reaction becoming limited by H 2 availability rather than through catalyst deactivation. On the other hand, a determination of residual H 2 O 2 (i.e., H 2 O 2 not consumed through degradation pathways or in the conversion of benzyl alcohol) (Table S11) reveals that, for the 1% Pd/TiO 2 and 1% PdAu/TiO 2 catalysts, this metric decreases substantially over the reaction time studied, with a maximum residual H 2 O 2 concentration being observed after 5 min online, at 130 and 188 μmol H2O2 for the 1% Pd/TiO 2 and 1% PdAu/TiO 2 catalysts, respectively. In comparison, a measurement of residual H 2 O 2 over the 1% PdFe/TiO 2 catalyst revealed that this metric was steady over 2 h, although at a far lower level (approximately 30 μmol H2O2 ) in comparison to that observed over the corresponding PdAu and Pd-only catalysts. In the case of the 1% Pd/TiO 2 and 1% PdAu/TiO 2 catalysts, these observations may indeed be indicative of catalyst deactivation, while the enhanced activity of the 1% PdFe/TiO 2 catalyst may result from the continual production of H 2 O 2 .A comparison of initial reaction rates (Table 3), at a short reaction time (5 min) where there is assumed to be no limitations associated with reactant gas availability, further highlights the increased activity of the 1% PdFe/TiO 2 catalyst.

        <p>XPS analysis of the three catalysts over the course of a 2 h reaction (Figure 6 and Table S12) indicates that the Pd 0 :Pd 2+ ratio observed in the fresh 1% FePd/TiO 2 material is maintained to a greater extent over extended reaction times, in comparison to that observed over the corresponding Pdonly and PdAu catalysts. For the 1% Pd/TiO 2 catalyst, a complete shift in Pd oxidation state toward Pd 0 , most likely as a result of in situ reduction, is observed after 5 min on-stream, while a similar shift is effectively observed after 15 min for the 1% PdAu/TiO 2 catalyst (Pd 0 :Pd 2+ = 0.96). By comparison, the presence of mixed Pd 0 -Pd 2+ domains is seen to be retained over a reaction time of 90 min (Pd 0 :Pd 2+ = 0.94) for the 1% PdFe/TiO 2 material. As discussed previously, 58 the presence of these mixed domains has been related to enhanced activity toward both H 2 O 2 synthesis and benzyl alcohol oxidation. As such, the enhanced activity of the 1% PdFe/TiO 2 catalyst may in part be attributed to the retention of these regions of mixed Pd oxidation states.XPS analysis of the three catalysts over the course of a 2 h reaction (Figure 6 and Table S12) indicates that the Pd 0 :Pd 2+ ratio observed in the fresh 1% FePd/TiO 2 material is maintained to a greater extent over extended reaction times, in comparison to that observed over the corresponding Pdonly and PdAu catalysts. For the 1% Pd/TiO 2 catalyst, a complete shift in Pd oxidation state toward Pd 0 , most likely as a result of in situ reduction, is observed after 5 min on-stream, while a similar shift is effectively observed after 15 min for the 1% PdAu/TiO 2 catalyst (Pd 0 :Pd 2+ = 0.96). By comparison, the presence of mixed Pd 0 -Pd 2+ domains is seen to be retained over a reaction time of 90 min (Pd 0 :Pd 2+ = 0.94) for the 1% PdFe/TiO 2 material.

        <p>Given the high H 2 conversion rates observed under our standard reaction conditions and the potentially H 2 diffusion limited nature of the reaction at relatively short reaction times, we next investigated the catalytic activity over multiple sequential benzyl alcohol oxidation tests, as shown in Figure 7 (the product distribution is shown in Table S13), where gas mixtures were replenished at intervals of 0.5 h. A near-linear increase in benzyl alcohol conversion was found over all three catalysts in this experiment. This possibly indicates (i) that if catalyst deactivation does occur then it is not a permanent effect or, more likely, (ii) given the first-order dependence of H 2 O 2 production with respect to H 2 , there is limited H 2 availability in the reaction. 68 Again, these sequential reaction studies clearly demonstrate the enhanced performance of the 1% PdFe/TiO 2 catalyst in comparison to the 1% Pd/TiO 2 and 1% PdAu/TiO 2 analogues. Indeed, the extent of benzyl alcohol conversion over the 1% PdFe/TiO 2 catalyst is exceptionally high (22.02%) with a near-complete selectivity (96%) toward benzyl alcohol and with limited production of either benzoic acid or toluene over four subsequent reaction runs. The activity of the 1% PdFe/TiO 2 catalyst is seen to far exceed the rates of conversion observed over the 1% Pd/TiO 2 (6.23%) and 1% PdAu/TiO 2 (11.75%) catalysts, when they are tested over the same number of sequential reaction cycles.Given the high H 2 conversion rates observed under our standard reaction conditions and the potentially H 2 diffusion limited nature of the reaction at relatively short reaction times, we next investigated the catalytic activity over multiple sequential benzyl alcohol oxidation tests, as shown in Figure 7 (the product distribution is shown in Table S13), where gas mixtures were replenished at intervals of 0.5 h.

        <p>With a particular focus on the 1% PdFe/TiO 2 catalyst, we next conducted a series of hot-filtration experiments to identify the contribution of leached metal species to catalytic activity (Table S14). In the absence of the solid catalyst, minimal additional products were observed, with a total product yield of 5.96% after the two-part, 1 h duration, hot-filtration experiment. This value was nearly identical with that observed for the same experiment conducted over the 1% PdFe/TiO 2 catalyst (5.60%), with the small quantity of additional total products observed partially attributed to the contribution from residual H 2 O 2 generated in the initial 0.5 h of the reaction (25 μmol).With a particular focus on the 1% PdFe/TiO 2 catalyst, we next conducted a series of hot-filtration experiments to identify the contribution of leached metal species to catalytic activity (Table S14).

        <p>To determine if the inactivity observed in the 1% PdFe/ TiO 2 hot-filtration experiment was due to the limited ability of the homogeneous component to synthesize H 2 O 2 , a further hot-filtration experiment was conducted whereby, after the initial 0.5 h reaction, the 1% PdFe/TiO 2 catalyst was replaced with a 1% Pd/TiO 2 catalyst, ensuring that the total moles of Pd was equal to that in the bimetallic catalyst. Perhaps unexpectedly, a minor improvement in total product yield was observed (7.65%), comparable to the sum of the 1% PdFe/TiO 2 (5.60%) and 1% Pd/TiO 2 (1.30%) components when they were used independently over 0.5 h. A similar finding was observed with regard to residual H 2 O 2 . Again, the contribution from residual H 2 O 2 , (25 μmol), synthesized over the 1% PdFe/TiO 2 catalyst in the initial 0.5 h experiment, should be considered. It is therefore possible to conclude that the contribution of leached species toward benzyl alcohol oxidation is negligible.To determine if the inactivity observed in the 1% PdFe/ TiO 2 hot-filtration experiment was due to the limited ability of the homogeneous component to synthesize H 2 O 2 , a further hot-filtration experiment was conducted whereby, after the initial 0.5 h reaction, the 1% PdFe/TiO 2 catalyst was replaced with a 1% Pd/TiO 2 catalyst, ensuring that the total moles of Pd was equal to that in the bimetallic catalyst.

        <p>We, along with others, have previously demonstrated the enhanced activity of PdFe catalysts for the oxidative degradation of phenol, through the bifunctionality of the catalyst where the Pd component synthesizes H 2 O 2 , while the Fe component catalyzes the production of oxygen-based radicals, which are known to be key in achieving high phenol conversion rates. [69][70][71] Considering the radical nature of benzyl alcohol oxidation when preformed H 2 O 2 is used as an oxidant, 19 we next set out to establish the underlying cause for the enhanced activity of the 1% PdFe/TiO 2 catalyst over its 1% PdAu/TiO 2 and 1% Pd/TiO 2 analogues.We, along with others, have previously demonstrated the enhanced activity of PdFe catalysts for the oxidative degradation of phenol, through the bifunctionality of the catalyst where the Pd component synthesizes H 2 O 2 , while the Fe component catalyzes the production of oxygen-based radicals, which are known to be key in achieving high phenol conversion rates.

        <p>Building on this earlier work, [69][70][71][72] we conducted a series of spin trapping electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy experiments using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) as a spin trap (with control reactions being reported in Figure S6). Figure 8A shows the spectra obtained under typical reaction conditions with the three different catalysts. Spectra i and ii, representing 5 and 30 min reaction times, respectively, were obtained using the 1% Pd/TiO 2 catalyst, with no radicals trapped in solution for this catalyst. In the case of the 1% PdAu/TiO 2 catalyst, spectra iii and iv are for reaction times of 5 and 30 min, respectively, exhibiting a signal that can be attributed to an O-centered methoxy radical trapped by DMPO to form a DMPO-OCH 3 nitroxide radical adduct with g iso = 2.006, a iso ( 14 N) = 1.373 mT and a iso ( 1 H β ) = 0.858 mT, which are in agreement with previously reported hyperfine coupling values. 72 Methoxy-based radicals (CH 3 O • ) in the reaction medium are thought to originate from the solvent, i.e. methanol, which are known to act as a scavengers for • OH radicals 73,74 that are formed either during H 2 O 2 synthesis or by the catalyzed generation of • OH from the synthesized H 2 O 2 . It is therefore possible to conclude that the solvent is not benign and that the enhanced activity previously reported by Santonastaso et al. 8 in using a bimetallic AuPd supported catalyst in a methanol-rich solvent system may not only result from an increased solubility of H 2 . Interestingly, in the case of the 1% PdFe/TiO 2 catalyst, the concentration of the DMPO-OCH 3 adduct, at both 5 min contact time (spectrum v) and at 30 min contact time (spectrum vi), is higher in comparison to the 1% PdAu/TiO 2 and 1% Pd/TiO 2 catalysts, correlating well with the benzaldehyde yields. Slight decreases in the concentration of the adducts were also seen over longer contact times, which could be attributed to decomposition of the nitroxide species. A small secondary signal arising from ring opening of the spin trap adduct is also present at long contact times in the case of the 1% PdFe/TiO 2 catalyst (spectrum vi). This phenomenon has been previously reported in Fenton-like systems. 75 In order to confirm the proposed hypothetical mechanism and ascertain the nature of the primary radicals generated by the catalytic reaction of H 2 and O 2 , a series of spin-trapping experiments were conducted in water (Figure 8B) in the absence of species capable of scavenging • OH and • OOH radicals. Spectra vii and viii were recorded in the absence of benzyl alcohol, but in the presence of H 2 , O 2 , and a catalyst, 1% PdAu/TiO 2 (spectrum vii) or 1% PdFe/TiO 2 (spectrum viii). These spectra are dominated by the signal of a DMPO-OH adduct, showing equal hyperfine couplings for the 14 N of the NO • moiety and the β proton, g iso = 2.006, a iso ( 14 N) = 1.493 mT, and a iso ( 1 H β ) = 1.493 mT. This signal is symptomatic of • OH and/or • OOH trapping. The DMPO-OOH adduct has a half-life of 1-4 min and decays into DMPO-OH if unreacted DMPO is present; 76,77 therefore, under these conditions it is not possible to differentiate between • OH and • OOH. Under conditions where no reactant S13 for the product distribution. gases were present, but only benzyl alcohol and the catalyst, 1% PdAu/TiO 2 (spectrum ix) and 1% PdFe/TiO 2 (spectrum x), the concentration of the DMPO-OH adduct significantly decreased, as would be expected. Interestingly, a new signal characterized by g iso = 2.006, a iso ( 14 N) = 1.559 mT, and a iso ( 1 H β ) = 2.260 mT and consistent with a DMPO-trapped Ccentered PhCH • (OH) radical was noted. 66 This is an important observation because it suggests that PhCH • (OH) is most likely the first intermediate in the radical oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Spectra ix and x also indicate that the catalyst itself without H 2 and O 2 might be responsible for some limited activity, and in these circumstances the amount of radicals trapped when 1% PdAu/TiO 2 was used was higher than that when 1% PdFe/TiO 2 was used. Finally, spectrum xi reports the case of a reaction conducted with benzyl alcohol, H 2 , and O 2 , in the absence of a catalyst. In perfect agreement with the results described above, no signal from radical reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected, proving once more that radical ROS generation is a catalytic process. Nevertheless, the spectrum shows a small contribution of trapped PhCH • (OH) radicals. This is consistent with a small equilibrium amount of H 2 O 2 forming from H 2 and O 2 without the presence of a catalyst, which could have oxidized some of the benzyl alcohol present. It is therefore possible to conclude that the ability of Fe to catalyze the disproportionation of synthesized H 2 O 2 to ROS, via a Fenton pathway, is key in achieving the enhanced activity observed by the 1% PdFe/TiO 2 catalyst.Building on this earlier work, [69][70][71][72] we conducted a series of spin trapping electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy experiments using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) as a spin trap (with control reactions being reported in Figure S6).

        <p>We have demonstrated that it is possible to selectively oxidize benzyl alcohol with high selectivity to benzaldehyde via the in situ production of H 2 O 2 at temperatures where limited activity is observed with O 2 alone. The incorporation of Fe into a supported 1% Pd/TiO 2 catalyst is seen to dramatically enhance catalytic activity in comparison to either the monometallic Pd or analogous 1% PdAu/TiO 2 catalyst. Furthermore, we show that through continual replacement of the reactant gases it is possible to reach high yields of benzaldehyde, with the 1% PdFe/TiO 2 catalyst achieving yields approximately double those exhibited by the 1% Pd/TiO 2 and 1% PdAu/TiO 2 catalysts. The enhanced activity of the 1% PdFe/TiO 2 catalyst is attributed to the maintenance of domains of mixed Pd oxidation state and the continual low-level production of H 2 O 2 over extended reaction times.We have demonstrated that it is possible to selectively oxidize benzyl alcohol with high selectivity to benzaldehyde via the in situ production of H 2 O 2 at temperatures where limited activity is observed with O 2 alone.

        <p>EPR analysis revealed that the enhanced activity of the 1% PdFe/TiO 2 catalyst can be correlated with the increased formation of oxygen-based radical species in comparison to 1% PdAu/TiO 2 and 1%Pd/TiO 2 analogues. The formation of methyl-based radicals resulting from the radical scavenging ability of the reaction solvent has also been identified. However, at present we are not able to delineate the contribution to the overall oxidation reaction from the two categories of radical species, but the potential noninnocent nature of the methanol solvent is a crucial observation.EPR analysis revealed that the enhanced activity of the 1% PdFe/TiO 2 catalyst can be correlated with the increased formation of oxygen-based radical species in comparison to 1% PdAu/TiO 2 and 1%Pd/TiO 2 analogues.
