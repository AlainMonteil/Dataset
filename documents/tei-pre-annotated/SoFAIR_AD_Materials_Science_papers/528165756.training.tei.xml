        <p>Halide perovskites are a compelling candidate for the next generation of clean energy harvesting technologies thanks to their low cost, facile fabrication and outstanding semiconductor properties. However, photovoltaic device efficiencies are still below practical limits and long-term stability challenges hinder their practical application. Current evidence suggests that strain in halide perovskites is a key factor in dictating device efficiency and stability. Here, we outline the fundamentals of strain within halide perovskites relevant to photovoltaic applications and rationalize approaches to characterize the phenomenon. We examine recent breakthroughs in eliminating the adverse impacts of strain, enhancing both device efficiencies and operational stabilities. Finally, we discuss further challenges and outline future research directions for placing stress and strain studies at the forefront of halide perovskite research. An extensive understanding of strain in halide perovskite is needed, which would allow effective strain management and drive further enhancements in efficiencies and stabilities of perovskite photovoltaics.Halide perovskites are a compelling candidate for the next generation of clean energy harvesting technologies thanks to their low cost, facile fabrication and outstanding semiconductor properties.

        <p>Halide perovskites have been thrust into the limelight in the last decade as a promising nextgeneration photovoltaic technology, with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) already comparable with those of crystalline silicon devices. Reductions in unwanted energy losses both in the absorber and at interfaces with contact layers have led to substantial efficiency and stability improvements. Recently, strain control has been at the forefront of device efficiency enhancement in halide perovskites by minimizing undesirable defect formation 1,2 , and subsequent nonradiative recombination 3 . A certified PCE of ~24.4% has recently been reported for FAPbI3-based devices (FA=formamidinium) through managing strain, with the encapsulated devices retaining 90% of their efficiencies after 400 hours at maximum power point 1 . Such encouraging achievements suggest that strain engineering is a powerful tool to enhance efficiencies and stabilities for a broad range of practical applications. Despite such successes, there is an apparent paradox whereby similarly strained halide perovskites exhibit either beneficial or detrimental effects even when they are nominally similar materials. Furthermore, the magnitude of strain is relatively high in halide perovskites compared to other photovoltaic systems: for instance, residual strain values of up to ~2.4% for α-FAPbI3 4 and ~1.6% for CsPbBr3 have been reported 5 , whereas the performance of Si and Cu(In, Ga)Se2 devices drops substantially when residual strains exceed ~1% 6,7 . The high magnitude of strain in perovskite materials is particularly striking since perovskites are one of the most mechanically fragile of any photovoltaic materials 8 . It is therefore essential to thoroughly understand the fundamentals of strain on different length scales, and to devise effective methods to characterise it. This will allow us to move towards rational engineering as opposed to empirical optimisation.Halide perovskites have been thrust into the limelight in the last decade as a promising nextgeneration photovoltaic technology, with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) already comparable with those of crystalline silicon devices.

        <p>The aspects of strain in a material that can be determined with typical laboratory techniques include tensile and compressive strain where the interplanar spacing, , of the material is compared to a reference "unstrained" value. Typically, the variation in spacing is observed through the Bragg peak positions in an X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern. If a material is compressively strained, the spacing is decreased relative to the reference, and the peak associated with that plane will shift to higher scattering vector, (Fig. 1a,b), with the converse being true for tensile strain. The values of compressive/tensile strain are usually expressed as a ratio of the spacings and written as percentages. The nature of strain (compressive/tensile) is indicated either explicitly or using a negative/positive sign indicating compressive/tensile strain, respectively. However, we note that such measurements only probe the diagonal ( ) elements of the strain tensor. Furthermore, applying a load (stress) to a material results in deformations (strain) not only in the directions parallel to, but also perpendicular to the load (Poisson's effect). For example, a biaxial in-plane tensile strain in a halide perovskite thin film will also result in a compressive strain in the direction of the film normal 11 . This is especially pertinent because many lab-based X-ray diffractometers are in Bragg-Brentano (reflection) geometry with the scattering vector in the direction of the film normal. Consequently, it is the out-of-plane compressive strain that will be probed. An additional feature of strain reported is "microstrain" which is determined by Bragg peak width analyses. If the diffraction measurement simultaneously samples a number of different spacings within the sample, then contributions from all these spacings will combine to form a broadened Bragg peak (Fig. 1c). Microstrain is a measure of local deviations of spacings from their average value and includes contributions from both locally compressively and locally tensile strained regions. A commonly employed method for calculating microstrain is Williamson-Hall analysis 12 . The method relies on the different q-dependence of Bragg peak broadening resulting from microstrain and crystallite size effects and, despite the method's ubiquity, there are many potential pitfalls. One must first remove any instrument broadening, which is typically accomplished using an external standard, but these standards may not be in the same form as the sample (e.g. thin film) and thus do not exactly reproduce the conditions of the diffractometer for the sample. Further, many nuances influence the crystallite size calculation including the distribution of sizes, shape, and crystallite length in each crystallographic direction. Errors in calculation of particle size will have a knock-on effect for determination of microstrain. Depending on the structural features (dislocations, variable lattice distortion, grain surface relaxation) there may or may not be a strong ℎ dependence on microstrain peak broadening, which complicates matters further. Therefore, the researcher must be especially diligent when carrying out peak broadening analyses from lab-based bulk XRD measurements 12 . We also stress that microstrain values are not directly comparable to compressive/tensile strain values given that these two quantities probe different aspects of material structure. The community must avoid interchangeable use of these terminologies to prevent errors.The aspects of strain in a material that can be determined with typical laboratory techniques include tensile and compressive strain where the interplanar spacing, , of the material is compared to a reference "unstrained" value.

        <p>Another important consideration is the relevant length scale of the measurement. All of the lattice planes that satisfy the Bragg condition within the sample interaction volume (defined by the footprint and penetration depth) of the X-rays contribute to a given diffraction peak. In most lab-based X-ray diffractometers, the beam footprint is on the scale of millimetres squared and so the interaction volume is large and variations in spacings in this region result in a broadened Bragg peak. However, by reducing the beam footprint and scanning the illumination position across the sample, the local shifts in spacing can be resolved in the form of a tensile and compressive strain map. This forms the basis for spatially resolved XRD techniques (micro-or nano-XRD) that are able to measure local peak shifts or phase changes 3 . Overall, one must consider the relevant length scales to probe in halide perovskites given that heterogeneities are present over nanometers up to many micrometers 13 .Another important consideration is the relevant length scale of the measurement.

        <p>Other advanced techniques are required to probe beyond the diagonal elements of the strain tensor corresponding to structure expansion/contraction. By using the three-dimensional intensity distribution around Bragg peaks, one can reconstruct the electron density of a crystal to find the atomic displacement vectors (Fig. 1d) from which the off-diagonal components of the strain tensor can be extracted.

        <p>Strain can result from a broad range of factors. During film formation, the precursor solutions are deposited on a substrate and the film is annealed (often above 100 o C). If the film is formed on a substrate with a lower coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) than the perovskite (3.3~8.4 ×10 -5 K -1 ) 16 , the substrate restricts the contraction of the perovskite along the in-plane directions during cool down 17 , resulting in an in-plane tensile strain (Fig. 2a, top). Analogously, compressive strain can occur in a film grown on a substrate with a higher CTE than that of the perovskite, though this is less common in halide perovskite devices. This process of cooling after annealing leads to strain (generally tensile) in the plane of the film.Strain can result from a broad range of factors.

        <p>Lattice mismatch between the substrate and the as-formed perovskite film can also generate a tensile or compressive strain (Fig. 2a, middle), depending on whether the spacing of the substrate is larger or smaller than that of the perovskite overlayer. However, when the lattice mismatch is large, the perovskite crystal randomly stacks on the bottom crystal, resulting in a non-uniform interfacial distortion 18,19 . Compressive and tensile strains can also be introduced to films using mechanical film bending 20 (Fig. 2a, bottom) and hydrostatic pressure 21 .Lattice mismatch between the substrate and the as-formed perovskite film can also generate a tensile or compressive strain (Fig. 2a, middle), depending on whether the spacing of the substrate is larger or smaller than that of the perovskite overlayer.

        <p>While the above factors generally influence strains across the whole film, other factors including atomic misfits, phase transitions, light/bias stimulation and grain boundaries are linked to local strain (namely microstrain) in halide perovskites (Fig. 2b). For example, in FAPbI3, the large FA cation within the 3D structure promotes local PbI6 octahedral tilting (that is, the Pb-X-Pb angle deviates from the ideal 180 o ), resulting in a local lattice distortion 2,22 . Further, local lattice distortion and strain are greatly elevated during phase transitions, where the symmetry of the crystal structure is generally lowered compared to the cubic perovskite structure. Group theoretical analysis 23 of octahedral tilting schemes yields group-subgroup relationships between perovskite phases (e.g. I4/mcm is a subgroup of Pm3 m) which can transform in a continuous (i.e., second-order) fashion, leading to spontaneous strains due to continuous lattice parameter variation between phases upon octahedral tilting [24][25][26] . Large strains and complex microstructure, such as martensitic nano/microstructures 26 or crystal twins, can result from discontinuous (i.e., first-order) phase transitions with abrupt changes in lattice parameter, which can occur between non-group-subgroup related space groups (though firstorder transitions between group-subgroup phases are also possible). Such a transition is found in MAPbI3 (MA = methylammonium) between I4/mcm to Im3 , at a hydrostatic pressure of ~0.3 GPa 21 . Martensitic transformations are diffusionless and often involve a lowering of crystal symmetry (e.g., from cubic to tetragonal 27 ) and when the resulting phases are mutually spatially constrained, strain minimisation can result in a change in shape and curvature of their interface 28 . Therefore, one can use strain to vary the nano/microstructure resulting from martensitic transformations, as has been shown, for example, in SrSnO3 29 . Given the prevalence of symmetry lowering phase transitions in halide perovskites, a more detailed understanding of the strains resulting from phase transitions will be beneficial.While the above factors generally influence strains across the whole film, other factors including atomic misfits, phase transitions, light/bias stimulation and grain boundaries are linked to local strain (namely microstrain) in halide perovskites (Fig. 2b).

        <p>Photovoltaic devices are exposed to light and bias during operation, and these have been reported to affect microstrain in halide perovskites. Recently, it was suggested that microstrain is enhanced under illumination owing to light-assisted ion migration and/or phase segregation 30,31 . Here, it was proposed that photoexcited carriers within perovskites interact with the soft, ionic lattice 32,33 , resulting in greater microstrain. Further, some works attempt to probe the links between photo-induced lattice expansion and microstrain (excluding the effect of ion migration), but debate is ongoing 34,35 . Under illumination, the polarity (positive or negative) and magnitude of bias voltages have also been reported to be critical in inducing microstrain by enhancing ion migration 30 .Photovoltaic devices are exposed to light and bias during operation, and these have been reported to affect microstrain in halide perovskites.

        <p>Grain boundaries can be another source of strain in halide perovskites (Fig. 2c, left) with the resulting strain dependent on the specific interfacial conditions, e.g., orientation mismatch at boundaries 36 , of which there is striking variation within thin films. It has been proposed that defect formation at certain grain boundaries in perovskite thin films stems from asymmetric strain fields at junctions between grains 37 . The high degree of lattice distortion and nonstoichiometric chemical distribution at grain boundaries also cause large strain fields 3,38 . Apart from boundaries between grains, sub-grain lattice orientation disorder 36 (Fig. 2c, middle) and twin boundaries may also be sources of strain in halide perovskite films 39 .

        <p>The impact of strain on device performance is complicated by the apparently contrasting responses of different perovskite systems to strain and the problem of defining an 'unstrained' reference state. To illustrate this, Fig. 3a shows time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) for a MAPbI3 film 3 , showing regions with greater local compressive strain (relative to the average spacing of the film) associated with the shorter PL lifetime, albeit the net strain on the film is unknown. By contrast, in (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 films (Fig. 3b) the PL lifetime is reported to increase upon compressive strain 41 . The reason for these apparent differences may be complex, and one must consider how to best benchmark absolute strain and how the different compositions or growth methods will impact both strain and recombination, for example, due to photodoping in the mixed-component systems 42 . Further, Fig. 3c shows that the bandgap increases for FA1-xCsxPbI3 but decreases for FA1-xCsxSnI3 with increasing Cs content, despite a reduction in lattice parameter in both cases 43 . These conflicting trends are attributed to octahedral tilting dominating over isotropic structural contraction in FA1-xCsxPbI3 and highlight the importance of probing the various structural degrees of freedom in the perovskite.The impact of strain on device performance is complicated by the apparently contrasting responses of different perovskite systems to strain and the problem of defining an 'unstrained' reference state.

Further, Fig. 3c shows that the bandgap increases for FA1-xCsxPbI3 but decreases for FA1-xCsxSnI3 with increasing Cs content, despite a reduction in lattice parameter in both cases 43 . These conflicting trends are attributed to octahedral tilting dominating over isotropic structural contraction in FA1-xCsxPbI3 and highlight the importance of probing the various structural degrees of freedom in the perovskite.</p>
        <p>To maximise device efficiency, any nonradiative recombination must be minimised as this leads to power losses. While most defects in halide perovskites are benign, there are still deep trap states, which are detrimental to performance. For example, large variations of intragrain crystallographic orientations and concomitant local strains are linked to higher trap densities 36 . Furthermore, larger grains exhibit more sub-grain misorientation leading to higher trap densities. This suggests that managing local strain is even more critical than tuning morphological grain size for minimising nonradiative recombination. At the sub-grain level, twinning has been shown to be ubiquitous in FA-based systems due to the low twin formation energies 44 ; however, these are expected to be benign from a carrier recombination perspective 39 .To maximise device efficiency, any nonradiative recombination must be minimised as this leads to power losses.

        <p>To understand the effects of strain on the band structure of halide perovskites we must first recognise that the valence band is governed by the anti-bonding overlap between Pb s orbitals and halide p orbitals, while the conduction band is dominated by the non-bonding overlap between Pb p orbitals with minor contributions from halide p orbitals. Strain-induced changes in Pb-X bond lengths and bond angles (Pb-X-Pb) and associated changes in orbital overlaps lead to changes in band dispersion 45 . In turn, the bandgap increases with increasing tensile strain and decreases with increasing compressive strain 41 . Carrier mobility has been shown to increase with increasing compressive strain due to a reduction of carrier effective mass, though at higher magnitudes of compressive strain the mobility decreases due to generation of dislocations 4 . In 2D A2PbBr4 [(A= n-butylammonium, n-octylamonium, or phenethylammonium ( PEA)] 46 , mobility was increased by tuning the cation stacking pattern, alleviating microstrain, and reducing electron-phonon interactions. Few-layer 2D perovskites are also observed to exhibit an expanded structure accompanied by a blue-shifted PL emission peak in comparison to bulk 2D perovskites 47 . These reports show that strain is a key optimisation parameter and an essential structural lever for modulating device performance.To understand the effects of strain on the band structure of halide perovskites we must first recognise that the valence band is governed by the anti-bonding overlap between Pb s orbitals and halide p orbitals, while the conduction band is dominated by the non-bonding overlap between Pb p orbitals with minor contributions from halide p orbitals.

        <p>Intrinsic device stability is arguably the most important topic for halide perovskites. Ion migration has been associated with device instability, owing to degradation caused by atomic rearrangement or redox chemistry between migrated ions and other species. Evidence suggests that the halides are the most mobile ions in halide perovskites 48,49 . The activation energy of ion migration has been reported to increase with compressive strain and decrease with tensile strain (Fig. 3d) 16 . This result is consistent with other reports of temperature-dependent conductivity measurements, where increasing compressive strain (relieving tensile strain) results in more stable films 17 . However, here substrates were generally bent along only one axis and so the stress applied was uniaxial. Due to Poisson's effect, there will be strains of opposite signs in the directions perpendicular to the direction of the uniaxial strain. As such, both tensile and compressive strains are expected to exist along different directions in the plane of the film. Furthermore, consideration of the impact of cracks and wrinkles in the film will be needed, as these features may be induced in such bending studies and will affect ion migration. The increasing compressive strain has also been shown to increase the radiation hardness of CsPbBr3 microcrystals (Fig. 3e) 5 . Further, it has been reported that increasing hydrostatic pressure increases the range of miscible I:Br ratios in MAPb(I1-xBrx)3, and inhibits ionmigration-driven halide segregation 50 . There is still much to be understood about the fundamental mechanisms of halide segregation. Future work will need to explore, for example, how the material's elastic energy changes to maintain the coherency of the underlying lattice in mixed component systems with different ionic sizes [51][52][53] . The variation of the free energy as a function of composition in alloyed perovskite systems due to coherency strains may, in turn, dictate the miscibility gap of the mixed ions, and elucidate the specific segregation mechanisms 54 .Intrinsic device stability is arguably the most important topic for halide perovskites.

        <p>Strain also affects the stability of halide perovskites by regulating the thermodynamics of defect generation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the defect formation energy of the halide vacancies in halide perovskites decreases with increasing tensile strain 16 . The defect concentration in tensile strained (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 is reported to be higher than that in its less strained counterpart (2.6×10 16 versus 2.1 × 10 16 cm -3 ) 55 . Moreover, calculations show that shallow defect states in MAPbI3 close to the valence band become even shallower under low hydrostatic pressure (0.3 GPa) 56 . However, in FAPbI3 and FA0.75Cs0.25PbI3, a higher pressure (2 GPa) 45 has been reported to transform shallow iodide vacancy defects into deep level states. More critical comparisons on identical perovskite systems will be needed to generalize such observations. Other computational work suggests that under biaxial strain (compressive or tensile), the lowest energy phase of MAPbI3 is orthorhombic, indicating the presence of a thermodynamic driving force for a phase transition from the desired cubic phase 57 . This contrasts with work on the FA-based analogue showing that compressive strain suppresses the transition from the cubic to tetragonal phase 4 . This is another example of nominally similar halide perovskite systems responding to strain in opposing ways.

        <p>Thermal annealing is a routine step in the preparation of polycrystalline perovskites. However, any thermal expansion mismatch between the perovskite thin film and adjacent layers must be considered for strain generation in perovskites and ideally minimised. The bottom panel in Fig. 4a shows aged MAPbI3 films, one on a Si substrate that has degraded to a yellow colour (PbI2), and the other on a polycarbonate substrate that remains as a dark absorbing film. The difference is attributed to the larger in-plane tensile strain in the film on Si due to the greater CTE mismatch between the perovskite and Si substrate 20 . One way to address this issue is through modification of the annealing process. A variation on standard film fabrication procedures is where the perovskite film is fully formed on the substrate at room temperature (with or without post-annealing) thereby lowering the tensile strain in the film 20 . Another low-temperature approach has enabled photovoltaic devices to deliver an impressive PCE of 23.1% by utilising amine assisted crystallization at room temperature 63 . While these reports show the potential for annealing associated modification of the deposition process, further innovation is required to avoid large residual strains in films. Comparing solution-processed films with thermally evaporated ones (in which the photoactive black perovskite phase can form even without annealing 64 ) may also provide insights into any hidden role played by solvent molecules 65 .

        <p>Compositional tailoring (Fig. 4b) involves substituting different ions into lattice sites and has been reported to be effective in reducing microstrain in halide perovskites. For example, the incorporation of ions with radii smaller than FA (253 pm) 66 , such as MA (217 pm) 66 and Cs (167 pm) 66 at the A-site 2,22 , and/or Br (196 pm) 2 and Cl (181 pm) 2 at the X-site 2,22 , has been proposed to reduce the microstrain in FAPbI3-based systems, with a potential strain relaxation mechanism where these additives could decrease the B-X bond lengths and the B-X-B bond angles 2 , a conclusion ascertained from DFT calculations 2 . Another approach is to incorporate larger cations (such as PEA) to form 2D or 2D/3D perovskites. This has been shown to promote preferred crystal orientation, reduce Bragg peak width, and increase Bragg peak area (generally indicative of reduced microstrain), yielding improved device efficiency over the 3D-only controls 67 . Recently, simultaneous incorporation of smaller Cs and larger MDA (methylenediammonium; 262 pm) A-site cations into FAPbI3 has been shown to suppress microstrain without increasing the bandgap 1 . The reported microstrain relaxation was associated with a decrease in defect concentration (Fig. 4b, bottom) and nonradiative recombination losses, leading to a PCE of ~24.4% and promising stability 1 . In this work, the authors note that the simultaneous introduction of larger and smaller ions could modify the local strain in the perovskite lattice, yet the octahedral tilting they proposed, as a mechanism for such microstrain reduction still requires direct experimental evidence. Determination of local atomic structure, for example with pair distribution function analysis, high-resolution electron diffraction, or X-ray fine structure measurements, will be of great value to confirm or refute proposed strain relaxation mechanisms.Compositional tailoring (Fig. 4b) involves substituting different ions into lattice sites and has been reported to be effective in reducing microstrain in halide perovskites.

        <p>It is of interest to examine if strain can be modified by inserting an interlayer between the perovskite and the substrate. To date, some compliant interlayers have been reported to relax strain in perovskites caused by CTE mismatch between substrate and perovskite 40,71 . However, given the thickness of typical interlayers (roughly a few tens of nanometers), the underlying mechanisms are likely to be more complex. For example, the use of a compliant polytriarylamine interlayer on top of a Si substrate, with a thickness of ~20 nm, will not have a significant effect on alleviating the CTE-mismatch-induced strain experienced by the top perovskite layers 20 . Furthermore, despite claims in recent reports 18,72 , interlayers are unlikely to facilitate strain control by minimising the lattice mismatch at the interface because the perovskite growth processes are unlikely to be epitaxial 73 (owing to the typical solution processing methods of these films) and thus lattice matching with the substrate may, in general, not be relevant. In other work, it has been proposed that the top contact layer can be modified for use as a strain compensation layer. For example, poly[5,5-bis(2-butyloctyl)-(2,2bithiophene)-4,4′-dicarboxylate-alt-5,5′-2,2′-bithiophene], which has a larger CTE than CsPbI2Br, could lead to a compressive strain on the CsPbI2Br layer below, offsetting the residual tensile strain in the perovskite 16 . Constructing a 2D perovskite layer on top of the 3D perovskite has also been shown to reduce the residual stress in perovskites (Fig. 4c, bottom) 55 , based on 2D perovskites exhibiting a lower Young's modulus. However, care must be taken to determine whether the corresponding stress and strain reductions in perovskites are truly due to the mechanical action of these contact layers. Furthermore, efforts should be made to assess the stress and strain evolution at the 2D/3D interface, which is likely to be influenced by the orientation of the 2D perovskites relative to their 3D counterpart 74 . Besides, not all 2D/3D interfaces will be sufficiently stable without further management: for instance, it has been proposed that invasive ions from the underlying 3D perovskites interrupt the Van der Waals interactions in the 2D layered perovskites 75 , which could drive layer slippage and even fracture.It is of interest to examine if strain can be modified by inserting an interlayer between the perovskite and the substrate.

Meanwhile, Young's modulus exhibits a directional anisotropy, with E110 ˂ E100, in cubic MAPbX3 (X=Br, Cl), making it more facile for deformations to propagate in the 110 direction than in the 100 direction 82 . However, care must be taken when extracting microstrain values for particular crystallographic directions from individual Bragg peaks, especially if assuming negligible crystallite size broadening based on the morphological grain size given the presence of subgrain heterogeneities 13 . Tilting of the octahedral BX6 4-units has been well studied in other systems based on the perovskite structure 83 and octahedral distortions including cation off-centring are also known in halide perovskites. However, study of octahedral tilting and distortion in halide perovskites are often limited to Goldschmidt tolerance factor considerations, which leads to difficulties when considering molecular cations that can form hydrogen bonds 83 . Although some researchers have noted the link between octahedral tilting/distortion and strain 84 , explicit characterisations of such structural features will be critical given the relationship between important properties such as bandgap and the largest metal-halide-metal bond angle 85 .The association of nonradiative losses with orientation mismatch 36 suggests that engineering films with greater preferred orientation should be targeted for improved optoelectronic properties.

        <p>The determination of stress and its impact on halide perovskites are under-explored areas and merit more dedicated studies. Uncompensated stress can cause fracturing of the perovskite leading to the loss of Ohmic contacts with the charge-selective layers and allowing the ingress of detrimental moisture and oxygen 86 . Stress analyses could explain film wrinkling, a common mechanism by which a film can relieve stress during formation 87 . Additionally, from a thermodynamic perspective, spatially heterogeneous distributions of stress can result in the local accumulation of elastic energy in films which is relevant given ions will rearrange until their diffusion potentials are uniform across the film 51 . Stresses will occur on both short and long length scales, with delamination 60 and cracking 88 being problems at the scale of tens of micrometres, and emergent microstresses at the grain boundaries and other operational stresses being concerns on the nano to atomic scale 11,89 . Defect pooling at grain interfaces can reduce the material's mechanical integrity by causing these interfaces to serve as fracture points 61 . Given the presence of sub-grain features and misorientations, solving the above issues will likely require strategies beyond just tuning processing methods. Stress can either be determined directly through curvature measurements 20,35,87 , or calculated indirectly, via interrogation of strain ascertained through material structure studies with use of appropriate proportionality constants. However, such indirect calculations of stress come with many complexities 88,90 . A common method for the measurement of the in-plane residual stresses in films is the sin method 88,90 .The determination of stress and its impact on halide perovskites are under-explored areas and merit more dedicated studies.

        <p>Beyond the perovskite bulk, regulating harmful strain at the substrate/perovskite interface is also crucial for improving device performance. Substrates with aligned nanopores have been employed to confine crystallization and impose compressive strain on perovskites, with the strain level dependent on the pore size 91 . Similar results are achieved through the manufacture of textured perovskite films 92 . Furthermore, perovskites that are infiltrated into a porous TiO2/ZrO2/Carbon layer have been shown to exhibit improved mechanical integrity 68 . Another emerging approach to reduce strain is to apply 2D materials (such as transition metal dichalcogenides) as interlayers where the Van der Waals interaction enables perovskites to expand/contract freely during heating/cooling processes 93 . We note, however, the key challenge of synthesising such 2D materials without dangling bonds. Regulating strain may also involve management of lattice matching at semiconductor interfaces, but this approach has received limited attention to date, probably for two reasons: first, there is a debate about whether typical solution processing of perovskites involves epitaxial growth processes, and second, the perovskite structure is sufficiently accommodating that device efficiencies have not suffered appreciably in the face of poorly lattice-matched interfaces. However, it is possible that some more sinister ramifications of poor lattice matching, such as delamination of layers in the device stack, only become evident after stringent, long-term operational testing 61 . Looking towards conventional semiconductors, epitaxial growth of perovskites on heterosubstrates can allow control of strain at the interface by tuning lattice matching. A halide perovskite epilayer grown on functional layers, without secondary transfer of the epitaxial perovskite, could be desirable for high-performance photovoltaic applications, and there is a wealth of literature on other materials with domain matching epitaxy 94 . Additionally, the application of intervening layers allows high-quality epitaxial growth of semiconductors with strain applied through carefully chosen lattice mismatches 60 .Beyond the perovskite bulk, regulating harmful strain at the substrate/perovskite interface is also crucial for improving device performance.

        <p>The presence of spatially heterogeneous strain in halide perovskite samples necessitates the use of local probes for studying strain. Current state-of-the-art film compositions contain many components which are known to segregate 98,99 . To adequately assess the impacts of this segregation, a local approach to strain characterisation is required, further employing techniques such as scanning probe nano-XRD and X-ray fluorescence 100 . There is also evidence for rich chemical heterogeneity at the grain and sub-grain length scales 13 . In alloyed systems 66 , including the Pb/Sn and mixed cation and halide systems, it is still unclear how the alloyed components are arranged -whether they vary from unit cell to unit cell, or if they tend to form clusters across the sample 101 . In the case of mixed halide samples, given the evidence for inhomogeneous halide distributions 42 , the observed compressive/tensile "strain" may be due to changes in composition rather than stress. The community, therefore, needs to expand its understanding of local chemical distributions through the use of nanoscale chemical mapping techniques 102,103 . Further, ion re-distribution in perovskites can gradually occur in response to strain, which, in turn, varies the strain distribution in perovskites 16 . To overcome these challenges, in-situ strain detection is required to view strain propagation in real-time.The presence of spatially heterogeneous strain in halide perovskite samples necessitates the use of local probes for studying strain.

        <p>Most reports on strain to date have been on neat film samples as opposed to device stacks, and so these works miss the complex interactions of the perovskite with adjacent layers in the device. Local heterogeneities in the perovskite material may also exist due to the influence of other device layers. Under electrical bias, there is evidence for photostrictive effects along with ion migration 48 , the activation energy of which can be altered by strain and is a vitally important phenomenon to understand in the field. Thus, developing techniques for in operando characterisations of microstrain in full and half devices for a complete understanding of the impact of strain will be fruitful.Most reports on strain to date have been on neat film samples as opposed to device stacks, and so these works miss the complex interactions of the perovskite with adjacent layers in the device.

        <p>A robust understanding of the origins and effects of strain in halide perovskite-based devices is needed to facilitate future breakthroughs. This will be especially critical in the construction of perovskite/Si and perovskite/perovskite tandems, where many layers may each contribute both stress and strain components, influencing overall efficiency and stability. As the halide perovskite community continues to push the envelope on long-term operational stability, strain will be a key parameter for optimisation and a versatile lever for control in more exotic devices.A robust understanding of the origins and effects of strain in halide perovskite-based devices is needed to facilitate future breakthroughs.
