        <p>Tin-based halide perovskites are promising candidates for the development of highly efficient and low-cost photovoltaics based on low-toxicity materials. Yet, the performance of Sn-HPs solar cells is far below that of other technologies. This work focuses on enhancing the photoconversion efficiencies and extending the operational lifetime of the devices through the beneficial synergy provided by the incorporated additives. Furthermore, crucial mechanistic details that determine the performance of the devices are provided with the aim of bringing this technology one step forward.</p>
        <p>Lead-based halide perovskites (Pb-HPs) have shown an outstanding performance in photovoltaic applications, leading to a steep increase of the PCE values from 3.8% to 25.5% in the past decade. [1][2][3][4][5][6] However, the potential risk to health and environmental hazard of Pb are clear handicaps for their commercialization. [7][8][9] Therefore, other elements such as antimony (Sb), 10 bismuth (Bi), 11 copper (Cu), 12 germanium (Ge), 13 and tin (Sn) 14 are currently being explored to substitute the highly hazardous Pb, as their derivatives are less toxic. 15 Among these elements, Sn has become the most promising candidate to substitute Pb because the resulting Sn-HP derivative possesses a suitable band gap of 1.2-1.4 eV, low exciton binding energy, and high carrier mobility. [16][17][18][19] Additionally, theoretical studies predict a maximum PCE value of 32.2% for formamidinium-tin-iodide (FASnI 3 )-based HP devices, 20 unlike the low theoretical values reported for other cations. 21,22 In this sense, great research efforts are being devoted toward the development of highly efficient Sn-HPs solar cells, and, in fact, efficiencies above 13% have been achieved so far. [23][24][25] However, Sn-HPs solar cells present severe stability issues. The easy oxidation of Sn +2 into Sn +4 which leads to the increase in the number of Sn +2 vacancies in the Sn-HPs structure and, therefore, induces the formation of</p>
        <p>Despite the unprecedented achievements that solar cells based on lead perovskites have experienced in the last decades, they still suffer from essential limitations. Toxicity has been considered a handicap since the commencement of their exploitation. The stability of halide perovskites is far from being comparable to that of silicon. In addition, the photoelectrochemistry that determines their performance, the degradation paths, and the role of the additives employed is not fully understood. Tin-based perovskites alleviate the toxicity associated with lead, and we have developed a synergetic chemical strategy to enhance the performance of devices, giving special emphasis to extending the operational stability. Remarkably, our findings point to the significance of the halides' chemistry in outlining the device's performance, as well as contribute to unveiling mechanistic details that determine the photoelectrochemical processes that rule the operating principles and degradation reactions. high levels of self-p-doping and high densities of trap states, 17,26,27 limits the longterm stability of these devices dramatically. Different approaches have been proposed in order to inhibit this oxidation, such as solvent engineering 28,29 or the use of reducing agents; for example, gallic acid (GA), 30 hypophosphorous acid (H 3 PO 2 ), 31 tin halides (SnF 2 and SnCl 2 ), 27,[32][33][34] Sn powder, 35 or phenylhydrazine hydrochloride (PHCl) 36 have been used as additives to prevent the Sn +2 oxidation and improve the crystallization of the perovskite, thus leading to a pinhole-free and more homogeneous film and, consequently, enhancing the device performance. Alternative approaches found in the literature are based on the incorporation of bulky ammonium cations into the Sn-HPs, e.g., ethylenediammonium (EDA), ethylammonium (EA), or phenylethylammonium (PEA), to form more stable 2D/3D-PS derivatives that are able to provide more efficient devices. [37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45] In this work, we introduce for the first time in the Sn-HPs thin-films a combination of dipropylammonium iodide (DipI), a secondary ammonium salt as a bulky cation, and an effective reducing agent, sodium borohydride (NaBH 4 ), with the aim of improving the performance and stability of FASnI 3 -based solar cells. The introduction of only DipI leads to PCE values that are up to 9.06% with a remarkable long-term and thermal stability under continuous illumination, as we showed in our previous work on Pb-HPs. 46 By contrast, the reducing properties of NaBH 4 play the role of preventing the oxidation of Sn +2 into Sn +4 during the solution processing, which promotes an improved film crystallization and minimizes the number of crystalline defects. Therefore, we have found that employing both additives induces a synergetic effect that leads to an efficiency of 10.61% with an outstanding stability. Interestingly, our characterization demonstrates the key role of iodide/iodine in the performance increase upon light soaking and in the long-term stability, thus revealing that the control of halide chemistry is fundamental for the long-term stability of Sn-HPs solar cells.</p>
        <p>Chemical engineering approach and device application On the basis of our previous work on MAPbI 3 and DipI 46 and considering the main limitations of Sn-HPs related to oxidative degradation that are generally observed in precedent works, 47,48 we decided to explore a combination of additives to synergistically induce an enhancement not only in the efficiencies but also in the long-term stability of the devices. Figure 1 shows the morphological and structural characterizations of the pristine FASnI 3 and those samples that contain DipI, NaBH 4 , and their combination. Details on film preparation and the preliminary optimization of precursors and additives concentrations (Tables S1-S4) are provided in the supplemental information. Figure 1A corresponds to the SEM image obtained for the pristine FASnI 3 film, which shows an inhomogeneous grain distribution with the presence of numerous pinholes and significant grain size polydispersity. This phenomenon has been extensively reported due to the fast crystallization and solvent-induced Sn +2 oxidation during the preparation of Sn-HPs precursors solution and film deposition. [49][50][51] Interestingly, a clear beneficial effect is observed on the morphological features of FASnI 3 films upon the incorporation of our additives. Particularly, the addition of DipI induces the formation of slightly larger crystals with more defined shapes and lower surface roughness compared with the pristine films; yet, the presence of pinholes is still detected (Figure 1B). Contrarily, when NaBH 4 is incorporated into the FASnI 3 precursor solution (Figure 1C), a very compact and pinhole-free layer is obtained. Strikingly, those films obtained in the presence of both additives (Figure 1D) revealed the beneficial effects provided by both chemical species, i.e., excellent surface coverage without the presence of pinholes, large and well-defined crystalline domains, and lower surface roughness. As shown in the AFM images (Figure S1), the roughness average (Ra) was estimated to be 2.83 nm for the pristine FASnI 3 and 2.58 nm for the FASnI 3 + DipI + NaBH 4 films (Table S5).</p>
        <p>Since the addition of additives seems to play a significant role on the Sn +2 stability (see below) and crystallization of Sn-HPS, we explored the crystallographic features of the resulting films to identify the crystal phases obtained. Figure 1E shows the XRD pattern of the FASnI 3 films with and without additives from which we can confirm that the same crystal phase is obtained in all cases; therefore, the addition of our additives does not affect the crystallographic properties of the Sn-HPs. In particular, six diffraction peaks were identified at 2q angle values of 14.1 , 24.5 , 28.2 , 31.7 , 37.5 , and 40.5 ascribed to the HP matrix, which correspond to the (100), (120), ( 200), ( 122), (222), and (300) crystallographic planes, respectively, of the orthorhombic lattice (Amm2 space group). 52,53 It is worth mentioning that the analysis of the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the dominant peak at 14.1 o (Figure S2) revealed a progressive decrease upon the addition of NaBH 4 , DipI, and a combination of both, respectively, thus confirming the increase of crystalline domains size when the additives are incorporated.</p>
        <p>In order to shed light onto the effect of the reducing agent on the Sn species upon light and air exposure, the absorption spectra of the HP precursor solutions with and without additives were monitored. As shown in Figure S3, all the fresh FASnI 3 precursor solutions (pristine FASnI 3 , FASnI 3 + NaBH 4 , FASnI 3 + DipI, and FASnI 3 + NaBH 4 + DipI) showed identical absorbance over the entire spectral range studied when the solutions were protected from air and light exposure. However, after light exposure at 1 sun conditions in air, significant differences were observed. Clearly, the sample without any additive showed a significant bathochromic shift of the absorption signal, which was corroborated by eye inspection of the solution that turned from being colorless to yellowish. This transformation is ascribed in precedent works to the oxidative degradation of Sn +2 toward the formation of SnI 4 . 29,51,54,55 Interestingly, those solutions in which our additives were introduced suffered a remarkably slower evolution of the absorption signal (monitored at 405 nm), as shown in Figure 2A. In particular, the solution that contained both additives suffered lesser variations of the absorption spectrum and a faster stabilization of the absorbance at 405 nm, which confirms that the combination of both additives indeed promotes a more effective inhibition of the oxidative degradation of Sn +2 species compared with the samples containing a single additive composition. As a direct consequence of the oxidation prevention, which was induced by the additives incorporated into the FASnI 3 precursor solution, a more uniform grain size distribution and pinhole-free smooth films with reduced presence of charge-carrier traps are obtained upon HP crystallization; see Figure 2D where longer photoluminescence (PL) lifetimes are recorded for samples with additives. In order to compare the effect of incorporating DipI into the Sn-HPs precursor solution, taking phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI) as a benchmark additive, as it is one of the most widely reported bulky cations in Sn-HPs, we explored the evolution of their absorption spectra upon exposure to light in air (Figure S4). Interestingly, the DipI solution showed a less prominent increase in the red-shifted signals compared with PEAI, thus suggesting that the alkylammonium salt used in this work may contribute to stabilize, direct or indirectly, the Sn +2 species more efficiently. This effect seems to be particularly crucial not only during solution preparation and handling but also along the crystallization process toward the formation of more robust semiconductors. Additionally, we characterized the optical properties of the FASnI 3 films obtained through the addition of additives and compared the results with those from the pristine Sn-HP samples. As shown in Figure 2B, the absorption spectra of FASnI 3 with and without additives are very similar, although a slight decrease in the absorbance is systematically observed upon the addition of DipI. Besides, the addition of DipI slightly blue-shifts the band edge absorption position, as shown in the inset of Figure 2B and Tauc plot, Figure S5, from which the band gap was determined to be 1.38 eV for both FASnI 3 and FASnI 3 + NaBH 4 samples and 1.39 eV for the counterpart HP films containing DipI. This small hypsochromic shift, together with the decrease in the absorbance along the UV-VIS-NIR spectral range, has been previously observed, 56,57 and it was ascribed to the insertion of the bulky cation into the HP structure. Note that samples with and without additives present similar thicknesses. The averaged thickness values were estimated to be 197 G 40 nm and 191 G 19 nm for FASnI 3 and FASnI 3 + DipI + NaBH 4 , respectively, from SEM images (Figure S6).</p>
        <p>The PL spectra of both FASnI 3 and FASnI 3 + NaBH 4 + DipI samples were practically identical (roughly, l max = 880 nm and FWHM = 57 nm), although, accordingly to the absorption spectra, an almost unperceivable blue-shift of 4 nm is observed for the sample containing both additives (Figure 2C). These results indicate that the use of DipI and NaBH 4 do not induce dramatic changes in the absorptive and emissive properties of the HP bulk, even though the bulky cation is inserted into the HP structure. However, time-resolved PL spectroscopy (TRPL) clearly revealed that the addition of DipI and NaBH 4 increases the charge-carrier recombination time by about 107% as compared to pristine FASnI 3 (Figure 2D), from t = 0.63 ns to t 0 = 1.30 ns, thus meaning that the additives lead to an efficient inhibition of the non-radiative recombination pathways.</p>
        <p>The beneficial effect of the additives on the PL lifetime is likely due to the improvement of the Sn-HPs crystallinity and film morphology (Figure 1), since bad quality crystallization is commonly related to the presence of trap states, 40,58 in combination to an efficient inhibition of the oxidative evolution of Sn +2 and, therefore, lesser formation of Sn 4+ recombination sites (see discussion below; Figure 2A).</p>
        <p>In order to explore the suitability of our approach to improve the performance and stability of the Sn-HP solar cells, we fabricated complete devices with inverted configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Sn-HP/C 60 /BCP/Ag (active area of 0.121 cm 2 ), which are shown in Figure 3A along with the forward (F) and reverse (R) scans of the J-V curve obtained for the champion FASnI 3 + DipI + NaBH 4 device, with a PCE of 10.61%. Figure 3B shows the F-scan of the J-V curves obtained for the FASnI 3 devices that illustrate the general behavior upon the introduction of the different additive combinations. Averaged cell parameters are summarized in Table S6. The cell parameters of the representative reference device displayed in Figure 3B, i.e., pristine FASnI 3 , shows an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.540 V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 18.20 mA$cm À2 , and a fill factor (FF) of 48%, which led to a low overall PCE of 4.72%.</p>
        <p>The reduced Voc of Sn-based devices is systematically reported in the bibliography 59 and commonly ascribed to trap states that originated from the oxidation of Sn +2 to Sn +4 , which may act as non-radiative charge recombination centers. Non-radiative recombination in the bulk and/or at the interfaces cause the limited Voc in Sn-HP solar cells. 60 By contrast, Jsc of solar cells is mainly determined by the optical absorption of the lightactive material and the efficiency of the charge extraction. For Sn-HPs with band gaps of 1.2-1.4 eV, the maximum Jsc could theoretically reach 40 mA$cm À2 . 59 Unfortunately, the current density values reported for Sn-HP devices are far below this value due to several reasons. On one hand, the insertion of additives, e.g., reducing agents or bulky cations, into the HP layer might hamper the charge transport/extraction. On the other hand, the higher density of defects of Sn-HPs compared with Pb-HPs induces a decrease in the charge-carrier lifetime, diffusion length, and mobility and, therefore, plays a detrimental role on the charge extraction. 61 Additionally, the reported thicknesses of Sn-HP films are roughly 200-300 nm (z200 nm in this work), which are significantly lower than the optimum value of 500 nm, according to theoretical calculations, as to ensure an optimum photon absorption. 62 According to the literature, the FF values obtained for Sn-HP devices are also systematically lower than those obtained from the Pb-HP counterparts. 59 It has been observed that Sn-HPs undergo a fast crystallization process that promotes the formation of numerous trap states, thus favoring severe non-radiative losses and, therefore, reduced FF.</p>
        <p>The results shown in Figure 3 were recorded after 3 days of continuous light soaking at 1 sun in N 2 atmosphere. The illumination treatment has a clear beneficial effect on the solar cell's performance, regardless of the presence/absence of additives (Figure S7). Therefore, unless it is specifically indicated, the provided solar cell parameters were obtained after a 3-day light soaking. The performances of the devices upon light treatment were statistically verified through the preparation of 80 devices for each composition, as presented in Figures 4A-4D and summarized in Table S6. As clearly seen, the overall results of devices for each additive composition are consistently confirmed along a significantly great number of replicas, thus allowing for the extraction of reliable conclusions. Figure S8 shows a histogram of the PCE values obtained for the Sn-based devices with and without additives, which, in turn, verifies the high reproducibility of the device's fabrication. Additionally, Table S7 andFig With our chemical engineering strategy, not only the addition of solely DipI or NaBH 4 but also the combination of these two, interestingly, contribute to a very significant enhancement of the averaged FF (Figure 4C), from 47% for the pristine FASnI 3 devices to 69%, 72%, and 71% (Table S6). In addition, Jsc is also remarkably enhanced when additives are introduced (Figure 4B). Compared with the pristine FASnI 3 , the devices containing DipI, NaBH 4 , and DipI + NaBH 4 showed remarkable averaged Jsc values of 22.6, 21.8, and 21.8 mA$cm À2 , respectively, which are much higher than the 18.20 mA$cm À2 obtained for the average reference device (Table S6). These results could be ascribed to the higher morphological quality of the films upon the addition of DipI and NaBH 4 , as shown in SEM images (Figures 1A-1D), and the additive-induced diminishment of trap-states in the bulk and/or interfaces as supported by the increase in the PL lifetime (Figure 2D), which, in turn, enhances the charge extraction efficiency. As a result, samples with additives present higher performances than bare FASnI 3 samples (Figure 4D), which increased from the 4.8% obtained for the averaged reference solar cells to 7.3%, 8.3%, and 9.6% for the averaged NaBH 4 , DipI, and DipI + NaBH 4 devices, respectively (Table S6). Hence, the highest performances were clearly obtained for those samples with both additives. Note that these devices also report the highest Voc (Figure 4A).</p>
        <p>Although Jsc and FF are systematically increased when additives are added, the behavior Voc present differences depending on the additive used (Figure 4A). Whereas reference devices and FASnI 3 + DipI samples present similar averaged Voc values, 0.540 and 0.530 V, respectively, FASnI 3 + DipI + NaBH 4 presents the highest averaged Voc of 0.620 V. By contrast, the lowest photovoltage, 0.460 V, is obtained for FASnI 3 + NaBH 4 devices (Figure 4A; Table S6). Likewise, with the aim of fairly deconvoluting the effects induced by the additive's incorporation and light-soaking treatment, Figure S7 shows the averaged solar cell parameters, before (fresh devices) and after the 3-day light-soaking treatment, obtained from a single batch of devices prepared with the different additive combinations. As it can be observed, all the fresh devices show similar Voc values, whereas the rest of the cell parameters are significantly enhanced upon the incorporation of any additive combination. Note that the Jsc, FF, and PCE enhancements are especially notable for the FASnI 3 + DipI + NaBH 4 devices due to the additives-induced synergistic effect. We speculate that NaBH 4 introduces an additional mechanism that causes a less pronounced increase of Voc after light-soaking. Perhaps, the reported incorporation of BH 4</p>
        <p>À to the perovskite structure, 63 which might inhibit other surface processes, could be behind this finding. It is very likely that the combined use of NaBH 4 with DipI avoids the incorporation of BH 4 À into the perovskite structure due to the passivating role of DipI; therefore, the synergistic effect that enhances the final performance of devices, with both additives incorporated, is achieved.</p>
        <p>The forward and reverse (F-and R-, respectively) scans of the J-V curves obtained for the FASnI 3 + DipI + NaBH 4 champion device are shown in Figure 3A, and those corresponding to the pristine, DipI and NaBH 4 devices, are presented in Figure S9, with the cell parameters summarized on Table S7. Our results suggest that the addition of DipI or NaBH 4 leads to negligible hysteresis in comparison with the pristine FASnI 3 device, which shows an intense inverted hysteresis. Precedent works claim that inverted hysteresis present in some Sn-HP devices might arise from a strong non-radiative charge recombination that could be minimized upon further device optimization. 64 The pronounced hysteresis obtained for our reference devices could point to the same origin. The rough surface morphology of the HP film and the presence of pinholes would contribute to the enhancement of the interfacial charge accumulation/recombination and, therefore, determine the hysteretic behavior of the solar cells and the reduced FF. 65,66 Despite the fact that the J-V curves of our optimized FASnI 3 + DipI + NaBH 4 reveals perceivable differences between the F-and R-scans (Figure 3A), the hysteresis is indeed much lower than that obtained for the reference devices (Figure S9).</p>
        <p>Given that the beneficial role of the additives, i.e., DipI and NaBH 4 , was unambiguously demonstrated in this work, we decided to explore their effect on the long-term film's and device's stabilities, which are the most limiting issues to be tackled nowadays in the HP-based technology field, especially for Sn-HPs. In a preliminary experiment, the absorption spectra of the freshly made films with the four different additives compositions were registered and compared with those registered upon 3 months of being stored in dark conditions in dry nitrogen. Even though the four samples retained a dark color perceivable to naked eye and displayed the characteristic XRD peaks (Figure S10), the absorption spectra of the pristine FASnI Beyond film stability, the stability of solar cell devices has been systematically analyzed. To do so, we performed the stability study of a fresh unencapsulated FASnI 3 + DipI + NaBH 4 device under continuous illumination at the maximum-power-point (MPP) (100 mW$cm À2 AM1.5G at a constant voltage of 0.45 V) in ambient conditions ($60% RH); see Figure S13 and Table S8 for the MPP analysis of during the measurement time. Note that the stability of the films must not be necessarily correlated with the stability of the devices, as the additional layers deposited on top of the perovskite may play a protective role against moisture and oxygen; e.g., C 60 has a hydrophobic character, adding a potential additional protection to the complete device. As shown in Figure 5A, 100% of the initial efficiency was maintained during the first 5 h, and then, a gradual drop started to occur reaching values of 96%, 93%, 88%, and 80% of the initial PCE after 6, 7, 8, and 9 h, respectively. Beyond 9 h, a faster performance decrease is observed, and, therefore, two welldifferentiated efficiency-drop regions are detected:(1) a slow PCE decrease region that was ascribed to the loss of FF due to device heating (temperature raised to 60 C because of the lamp heat radiation), and (2) a fast PCE lessening region due to FASnI 3 oxidative degradation. In any case, it is clear that the loss of PCE matches well with the decrease of the current density (Figure 5A), and, therefore it is very likely that both phenomena, i.e., loss of FF due to heating and the oxidative degradation of FASnI 3 , temporarily coexist upon 5 h at the measuring conditions.</p>
        <p>Figure 5B shows the comparison between the PCE (extracted from J-V curves) of pristine FASnI 3 and FASnI 3 + DipI + NaBH 4 solar cells. The devices were kept in N 2 atmosphere under continuous illumination at 1 sun using a UV cut-off filter, and the J-V curves were measured every 2 h. In both cases, we observed an increment of the initial efficiency due to a significant increase of the Voc (Figure S14). Although both devices initially showed a similar Voc increase with the light soaking, the pristine FASnI 3 started to degrade within the first 70 h of operation and it lost 40% of the initial PCE after 200 h. Contrarily, the PCE of the FASnI 3 + DipI + NaBH 4 device gradually increased, reaching up to 130% of the initial PCE after 500 h of light exposure (Figure S15). The same analysis was also made for the FASnI 3 + DipI and FASnI 3 + NaBH 4 devices, which showed a similar effect, although at slightly different rates. The FASnI 3 + DipI device displayed a rapid increment of the PCE within the first 100 h and reached the maximum efficiency after 500 h (150% of the initial PCE) and then decreased slowly, but after 1,000 h, it still retained 111% of the initial efficiency. The PCE drop was mainly ascribed to the loss of FF. Interestingly, the Voc and Jsc were insignificantly modified (Figure S16). The positive effect of light-soaking in Sn-HP solar cells has been previously reported 43 ; however, its origin has not been clearly identified yet.</p>
        <p>On the basis of this phenomenon, we currently introduce the light-soaking treatment as a part of the device fabrication aimed at enhancing the Voc of our devices. We determined that a continuous illumination (100 mW$cm À2 , AM1.5G) in N 2 atmosphere during 3 days is optimal for maximizing the solar cells performances. Figure S17 shows the resulting cell parameters before and after different days of light soaking. As mentioned before, the Voc is the main enhanced parameter that induces an increase in the PCE. Despite the other cell parameters not suffering dramatic variations within the first 3 days, the FF suffered a slight drop upon 5 days of light exposure, and consequently, the efficiency slightly decreased. In order to further study the stability of the FASnI 3 + DipI + NaBH 4 devices and compare it with that of the pristine FASnI 3 devices, we monitored the photocurrent at the MPP operation in N 2 atmosphere (at a constant bias of 0.3 V for pristine and 0.42 V for FASnI 3 + DipI + NaBH 4 , the original V MPP values of the fresh devices without light soaking). As shown in Figure 5C, the initial PCE of the pristine FASnI 3 -based device was kept for the first 26 h. Then, a steep decrease was identified and correlated with the degradation of the light-absorber layer, i.e., HP film. Very interestingly, the FASnI 3 + DipI + NaBH 4 device kept the initial PCE after 170 h at MPP and then retained 96% of the initial PCE at least during 1,300 h. These experiments confirmed the outstanding stability behavior of the FASnI 3 + DipI + NaBH 4 , considering that the most stable Sn-HP-based devices (encapsulated) reported up to date last for 1,000 h under continuous illumination at MPP, maintaining 95% of its initial PCE values (Table S9). 42,67 Therefore, we have been able to confirm that our approach based on chemical engineering provides valuable insights toward the fabrication of highly efficient and stable Pb-free HP solar cells.</p>
        <p>Eventually, it is worth remarking the good agreement between the photocurrent measured from the J-V curves and that obtained from the integration of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) for the pristine FASnI 3 and FASnI 3 + DipI + NaBH 4 devices MPP and long-term stability measurements (air or N 2 ) were measured under continuous illumination (calibrated Xenon lamp at 100 mW$cm À2 ). A fixed voltage corresponding to V MPP (determined for each sample from the J-V curves, after applying a 3-days light-soaking treatment) was applied for the MPP measurements, and the electrical photocurrent I MPP was monitored over time. See supplemental information. for further details.</p>
        <p>(Figure 5D). The EQE spectra show a wide photo response from the visible to the IR region, which also agrees well with the absorption spectra shown in Figure 2A. Note that the increase in photocurrent response for the sample with additives can be observed along the entire photoactive spectral range.</p>
        <p>All these results clearly demonstrate the beneficial contribution of our additives toward the development of a highly efficient and durable Sn-HP-based photovoltaics technology; however, the mechanisms behind the performance improvement must be identified. In this sense, we have made a systematic characterization in order to clarify the origin of the performance improvement upon light soaking and identify the mechanisms behind the superior performance observed for the devices with additives.</p>
        <p>Figure 6A shows the Sn 4d and I 3d XPS spectra of the fresh films based on both compositions, i.e., FASnI 3 without and with both additives. Interestingly, the films containing additives showed significantly larger Sn +2 /Sn +4 and I À /I 2 ratios, which is in excellent agreement with the expected role of our additives as oxidation inhibitors, as the experiment shown in Figure 2A suggested, thus explaining the initial higher performance of the samples with additives. The sensitivity of the XPS technique is limited only to the first few nanometers below the surface of the films. At the surface, defects and dangling bond sites are inevitably present and their reactivity is believed to be remarkably high. Consequently, the observation of a large fraction of Sn +2 ions on XPS, even at the surface of the fresh samples, is already indicative of the high quality of the samples, as the Sn +4 content in the bulk of our films is drastically lower (see the below discussion; Figure 6C).</p>
        <p>We have demonstrated that light soaking the Sn-based solar cells in inert atmosphere induces a significant enhancement in their performance over time, for both samples with and without additives, although this improvement is retained longterm only for the additive-containing devices. In order to shed light on the photoinduced processes involved, the evolution of the Sn +2 /Sn +4 and I À /I 2 ratios of the samples have been tracked by XPS after different light-soaking times (at 1 sun in N 2 atmosphere) from 0 to 15 days (Figure 6B). These ratios have been extracted from the analysis of XPS spectra (Figure S18). As it can be observed, both ratios increased with the illumination reaching their respective maximum values on the third day and later stabilized for longer light-soaking times (4-15 days). The increase of Sn +2 /Sn +4 ratio with a maximum value after three days of light-soaking is in excellent agreement with the performance improvement upon the illumination presented in Figure S17. This indicates that the main effect of light soaking involves a decrease in the relative amount of Sn +4 with respect to Sn +2 , which diminishes the defect density and, consequently, enhances the solar cell performance. The question remains to be whether the increase of the surface Sn +2 /Sn +4 ratio induced by the light-soaking treatment, even observed for the Sn-HP without additives, could be ascribed to the Sn +4 /Sn +2 photoinduced reduction.</p>
        <p>It is well known that heavy metal complexes may display metal-to-ligand or ligandto-metal charge transfer transitions, MLCT and LMCT, respectively, 68 especially if their intrinsic electron-donor(withdrawing) properties, i.e., redox potentials, are significantly different. This charge transfer processes are often optically active and can be rationalized as intramolecular photoinduced electronic transitions between the metallic center and the ligands or vice versa. Metal halides are clear examples of chemical species that present intense LMCT transitions, 69 and metal iodides are not an exception. Indeed, SnI 2 and SnI 4 powders show an intense orange color that stems from the optical charge transfer transitions from the iodides to the tin. The LMCT character of all low-energy transitions of the iodo complexes determines their photochemistry. Unlike chloro complexes and as observed in some bromo derivatives, metal iodides undergo a facile intramolecular photo-redox decomposition, which is characteristic of LMCT excitation. 70 Generally, LMCT induces the oxidation of a ligand anion to its radical and a one-electron reduction of the central metal. 68 On the basis of these premises, and considering the higher oxidizing character of the redox pair Sn +4 /Sn +2 (E red = +0.15 V versus standard hydrogen electrode [SHE]), 71 or even higher in more recent studies, 72 compared with that of Sn +2 /Sn 0 (E red = À0.14 V versus SHE), the increase of the surface Sn +2 /Sn +4 ratio is ascribed to the Sn +4 /Sn +2 photoinduced reduction. As shown in Scheme 1 (Reaction A), the Sn +2 formation upon the photoreduction of SnI 4 is inherently accompanied with the formation of molecular iodine (I 2 ) through a radical reaction mechanism. 70 Molecular iodine shows broad vibronic transitions, according to precedents in the literature. 73,74 We have registered the broad absorption signal of I 2 gas in the visible range ðl max abs = 524 nmÞ, which was also identified upon the irradiation of SnI 4 powder in argon at room temperature, as we experimentally demonstrate in Figure S19. These evidences account for the observed evolution of the Sn +2 /Sn +4 and I À /I 2 ratios detected for both FASnI 3 films (Figure 6B) and reveal the formation of I 2 upon SnI 4 light exposure, a process that is likely to occur also on HP films. In addition, this observation indicates that the evolution of FASnI 3 is influenced by the complex iodine chemistry. The key role of iodine chemistry in the defect formation and behavior for Pb-based perovskite solar cells has been broadly discussed, but its influence on Sn-HP solar cells have received less attention due to the broadly accepted easy oxidation of Sn +2 into Sn +4 and its main role in defect formation. However, Figure 6B highlights that Sn +2 /Sn +4 and I À /I 2 ratios are intimately correlated, and consequently, in order to understand the evolution of the former, it is necessary to examine the reactivity of the later.</p>
        <p>To this extent, another interesting and a priori, surprising aspect of Figure 6B is that after light soaking, the Sn +2 /Sn +4 ratio, which is initially higher for the samples with additives, becomes larger for those samples without additives. This fact demands a more detailed analysis because the samples with additives after light soaking still present a higher performance than those without them. It has been reported that I 2 has the tendency to migrate to the surface in Pb halide perovskites, 75,76 where it can sublimate or contribute to the degradation of FASnI 3 . 77 Note that the loss of I 2 increases I À /I 2 ratio and unbalance Reaction A in Scheme 1, thus shifting this reaction toward the products and consequently enlarging the Sn +2 /Sn +4 ratio. This point has been confirmed by storing samples under vacuum in the XPS chamber in order to promote the sublimation of I 2 , which induced an increase of both Sn +2 /Sn +4 and I À /I 2 ratios (Figure S20). Although this process is expected for both samples with and without additives, the incorporation of additives can influence the iodine chemistry in several ways. Those samples with additives present a decoupled evolution of the chemical ratios whose behavior may arise from several origins. (1) The introduction of DipI might stabilize/passivate the surface blocking the sites where I 2 can migrate. 75 This kind of passivation that affects the iodine interactions has been reported as a key aspect for increasing the performance and stability of Pb-based perovskite solar cells. 75,76 (2) The introduction of the reducing agent opens up a new chemical path (reaction B in Scheme 1). NaBH 4 would preferentially reduce the I 2 , which is already present in the fresh samples but also potentially photogenerated upon light exposure. Note that the redox potential of the I 2 /I À pair is +0.54 V versus SHE, thus being much higher than that of the Sn +4 /Sn +2 and Sn +2 /Sn 0 redox pairs. In other words, the presence of additives can contribute to passivate and inhibit the loss of iodine species, thus accounting for the lower Sn +2 /Sn +4 and I À /I 2 ratios observed in the XPS measurements compared with the pristine FASnI 3 samples.</p>
        <p>Aimed at proving that the photochemical activity of the additives is mainly located at the HP surface, the samples without and with additives were exposed to 1 sun illumination during 60 h (2.5 days) and sputtered with Ar + ions for only 30 s in ultra-high vacuum conditions with the aim of analyzing the inner film compositions. As it can be clearly observed in Figure 6C, the signals corresponding to Sn +4 and I 2 are no longer resolved for both sample compositions, thus confirming the capital role of surface in the performance and stability of Sn-based perovskite Scheme 1. Reactivity of the chemical species present in the FASnI 3 films solar cells. Interestingly, XPS analysis of the Na + content, aimed at detecting the NaBH 4 , before and after sputtering of the samples with additives, revealed that the alkaline cation is mainly present at the surface of the films (Figure 6D), thus verifying the apparent strong activity of the additives at the semiconductor surface. The pristine FASnI 3 film was also analyzed as a control experiment, and as expected, the Na + signals were unambiguously not detected.</p>
        <p>In order to understand why the samples with additives present a better performance after the light soaking despite the lower Sn +2 /Sn +4 ratios recorded compared with samples without additives, we monitored the PL signals over time under continuous excitation (see discussion below). Precedent works focused on elucidating the photochemical reactions that occur in Pb-based HP solar cells have reported apparently contradictory results regarding the evolution of the PL over the irradiation time. [78][79][80][81][82][83][84][85] In particular, two significantly different PL behaviors have been historically identified: (1) a PL intensity decrease (PLID) and (2) a PL intensity enhancement (PLIE), whose exact origin seems to be ascribed to the complexity of the photo-electrochemical reactions that occur in the HP-based semiconductor films, which, in turn, depend on the sample processing and measuring conditions, e.g., air versus inert conditions. It is worth mentioning that PLID is unanimously ascribed to photoinduced trap formation, whereas PLIE is understood as a light-induced trap annihilation process, which is also known as healing process.</p>
        <p>A recent work 75 correlates the photo-instabilities of the Pb-HP semiconductors/ devices with the light-induced formation and annihilation of defects that act as carrier trap states. The authors demonstrate through theoretical modeling and experimental evidence that, depending on the sample properties and/or measuring conditions, e.g., temperature, excitation intensity and wavelength, Scheme 2. Schematic illustration of device fabrication procedure steps both behaviors, PLID and PLIE, can be detected for a given sample. In this regard, we have monitored the PL evolution of our pristine FASnI 3 and FASnI 3 + DipI + NaBH 4 samples. Figure 6E clearly shows that continuous photoexcitation (l exc = 532 nm) of the FASnI 3 films without the incorporation of additives at room temperature in vacuum conditions resulted in a PLID behavior. Contrarily, the FASnI 3 + DipI + NaBH 4 film displayed a PLIE evolution. According to the precedent work reported by Motti et al., 75 interstitial iodine (I i ) can significantly trap both electrons and holes through the (+/0) and (0/À) transitions. Hole trapping/ de-trapping at I i À is a relatively fast process, whereas electron trapping at I i + induces long-living states because the strong associated geometrical relaxation decreases the kinetics of electron de-trapping. This long-living states trigger subsequent photochemical transformations leading to both PLID and PLIE. The recombination of I i À with iodine vacancies (V I + ) has been proposed as a means of I i À V I + trap annihilation, 80 which restores the initial material and decreases the concentration of traps, thus enhancing the PL. Contrarily, PL quenching is believed to arise from the direct recombination of two interacting I i</p>
        <p>to give I 2 . Importantly, both the coordinated I 2 and the I i À /I i + pair tend to migrate to the surface. At this stage, the photogenerated I 2 molecules that, in turn, can trap electrons as I i + do may not only remain bound to the surface or grain boundaries but can also be released as a gas or induce the FASnI 3 degradation process. 77 Therefore, the iodine imbalance between surface and bulk can trigger a series of compensating reactions that regenerate the starting equilibrium distribution of I i À /I i + defects to compensate their transformation to surface-bound and/or lost I 2 , thus contributing to trap formation and successive HP degradation, which justifies the observed PLID and the lower performance and stability of the samples without additives. Note that the passivation of surface sites in the samples with additives prevents the I 2 migration to the surface, and the subsequent imbalance between surface and bulk that triggers the defect formation. It is worth pointing out that our pristine Sn-HP sample shows an initial PL enhancement, roughly during the first 10 s and a subsequent PL quenching at longer irradiation times (Figure 6E), thus revealing a competition between the trap formation and annihilation processes. Hence, we infer that at the initial stage of the pristine FASnI 3 PL measurement, as well as for the FASnI 3 + DipI + NaBH 4 throughout the entire interval time studied, the trap annihilation accounts for the PLIE behavior. By contrast, the FASnI 3 film without additives displayed a PLID-like evolution at longer irradiation times (beyond 10 s) that is ascribed to trap formation reactions.</p>
        <p>Beyond the degradation mechanisms promoted by O 2 and H 2 O, 77 here, we show that iodine chemistry, even in inert atmosphere, plays a key role in the Sn-HP solar cells performance and stability, which also influences the Sn +2 /Sn +4 composition ratios and gives rise to the light-soaking effect. In addition, PL analysis also points out that iodine trap annihilation and formation processes reported for Pb-HPs could also be present in Sn-HPs. Eventually, additives influence the Sn-HP chemistry by surface passivation, e.g., DipI, and/or introduce additional iodine reactions that balance and fix surface iodine, e.g., NaBH 4 . These processes are summarized in Figure 7. The different balance of these processes, influenced by the introduction of additives, can explain our experimental results, thus confirming that the incorporation of our additives contributes not only to the diminishment of the defect formation during the fabrication but also to a trap-healing effect at operating conditions, which translates into an enhanced device efficiency and long-term durability.</p>
        <p>This work deals with the handicaps generally encountered during the fabrication of FASnI 3 devices compared with the Pb-based counterparts, i.e., reduced Voc and limited long-term stability. Our reference devices show a maximum PCE of 6.2% reached upon applying a light-soaking treatment. Unfortunately, the performance of these devices is drastically reduced after approximately 100 h under continuous illumination, even in inert atmosphere. Nevertheless, here, we successfully introduced a novel strategy based on the synergistic combination of two additives, DipI and NaBH 4 , into the FASnI 3 precursor solution, which not only enhanced the efficiency of the devices but also provided a dramatic beneficial impact on the longterm stability. Although the mechanisms might be different, both additives successfully prevent the Sn +2 /Sn +4 oxidation in the precursor solution. In fact, a more significant inhibition is induced when both additives are added. We have demonstrated that NaBH 4 has a significant impact on the stability of the Sn-HP films when they are stored in inert conditions. However, the beneficial stabilization of the films prepared with the incorporation of the studied additives was not observed in ambient conditions due to the hydrophilic character of the additives. Nevertheless, the additional stabilization produced by NaBH 4 was recovered for completed devices due to the protective effect of perovskite top contact. The observed synergistic effect from the combination of NaBH 4 and DipI additives, where the former increases significantly the stability while the latter acts as a surface passivating agent, results in an increase in the photoconversion efficiency, especially after light soaking. As a consequence, the use of NaBH 4 and DipI increases the Sn-HP solar cell PCE up to 8.06% and 9.06%, respectively, whereas the combined use of both pushes the solar cell PCE to 10.61%, as the synergistic combination of both additives boosts the Voc values upon the light treatment. In addition, outstanding stability levels are reported. In particular, these devices retained 100% of their initial PCE during 5 h under continuous illumination and still maintained 80% after 9 h at MPP in ambient conditions (air at $60% RH). Likewise, 96% of the initial efficiency was kept after more than 1,300 h under continuous operation at MPP in N 2 atmosphere. To the best of The role of NaBH 4 (redox mechanism) is crucial to prevent the iodine loss upon gas desorption from the HP surface, which translates into an inhibition of photoinduced trap formation. In the same line, DipI passivation avoids the migration of I 2 to the surface and the subsequent formation of bulk defects to compensate the surface/bulk unbalance. 75 The control of I 2 that triggers the degradation process of FASnI 3 into FAI and SnI 4 77 is also dramatic in order to extend the long-term device stability.</p>
        <p>our knowledge, these results are unprecedented for unencapsulated Sn-based devices and lead up to the development of outperforming Sn-HP semiconductors. In summary, our strategy allows preparing FASnI 3 -based devices in a highly reproducible manner that reach long-term stability levels that have not been reported to date. We have systematically characterized our devices in order to understand the origin of the higher performance and stability, as well as the beneficial light-soaking effect in inert atmosphere, independent of the absence or presence of additives. XPS and PL characterization point out the important role of the iodine chemistry in the Sn-HP solar cell performance and stability, which determines the light-soaking effect through Sn +4 photoreduction with formation of I 2 that is able to trigger the HP degradation, as well as accounting for the bulk healing effect and trap formation. Therefore, even though the light-soaking treatment induces an unambiguous beneficial impact on the device's performance, it does not seem to be the ultimate solution for further extending the device's lifetime, as it promotes a double side effect.</p>
        <p>On one hand, it induces a photoreduction of Sn +4 species and subsequent trap density diminishment in the bulk and at the interfaces, which is clearly positive. On the other hand, due to the inherent formation of molecular iodine that can act as a charge trap itself, the light-induced ageing also triggers a series of complex halide reactions that may evolve through the formation of new charge traps and drive to premature perovskite degradation. Hence, the exploration of novel strategies that are able to take benefit of the light-soaking effect while controlling the deleterious effect of iodine and their fully mechanistic understanding, similar to the one we report here based on a combination of additives with complementary roles, is required in order to bring the Sn halide perovskites one step beyond.</p>
        <p>Consequently, our results unveil the crucial relevance of controlling the photochemistry of halides toward an efficient long-term stabilization of Sn-HP films and devices and indicates the research direction to develop and test more efficient additives to not only provide an efficient passivation but also a thorough control over the halide chemistry. Therefore, this work provides valuable insights into the Sn-based HP solar cells toward further performance and stability improvement, which will pave the way to their eventual introduction into the photovoltaics technology market.</p>

        <p>In an initial stage of this research we optimized the DipI and NaBH4 additive's concentrations. The averaged cell parameters corresponding to devices with the different DipI/FAI ratios before and after a 4-hours light-soaking treatment in ambient conditions are displayed on Table S1 andS2, respectively. As it can be clearly seen, the fresh device's performances do not seem to be extremely influenced by the DipI content (Table S1), within the studied range; however, upon exposure to light the behavior is notably different. While the n=10 sample yielded a +4.7% PCE enhancement, the other compositions experienced a decrease in their performances (Table S2). Due to the slightly superior performance of the devices, we fixed the DipI content to n=10 with the aim of narrowing the number of variables throughout the device's optimization process, that corresponds to a DipI:FA mol ratio of 2:9.</p>

XRD patterns of the freshly made FASnI3, FASnI3+NaBH4, FASnI3+DipI and FASnI3+DipI+NaBH4 films compared to those obtained after exposing the same films to ambient atmosphere (air, ~20 ºC, ~50% R.H.) in the dark. As it can be observed, in ambient atmosphere those samples with additives degrade at similar rates or even faster, when a single additive is used, than the pristine FASnI3.

        <p>Note that equation 1 is the simplified version of a complex mechanism that involve intermediates and products that may accelerate the Sn-HPS degradation; in fact, this reaction is catalyzed by metals if water is present. 1 Therefore, the complexity of the chemistry involved in the degradation mechanisms of Sn-HPS and the great number of variables that seem to play a role, i.e. additives, tin oxidation, halides chemistry, atmosphere, illumination, moisture, etc., further investigation is required for a deeper understanding of the exact mechanisms that our additives play on the stability of the Sn-HPS films.</p>
