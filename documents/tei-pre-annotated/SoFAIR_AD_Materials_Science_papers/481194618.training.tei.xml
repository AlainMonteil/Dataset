        <p>Liposomes are essentially a subtype of nanoparticles comprising a hydrophobic tail and a hydrophilic head constituting a phospholipid membrane. The spherical or multilayered spherical structures of liposomes are highly rich in lipid contents with numerous criteria for their classification, including structural features, structural parameters, and size, synthesis methods, preparation, and drug loading. Despite various liposomal applications, such as drug, vaccine/gene delivery, biosensors fabrication, diagnosis, and food products applications, their use encounters many limitations due to physico-chemical instability as their stability is vigorously affected by the constituting ingredients wherein cholesterol performs a vital role in the stability of the liposomal membrane. It has well established that cholesterol exerts its impact by controlling fluidity, permeability, membrane strength, elasticity and stiffness, transition temperature (Tm), drug retention, phospholipid packing, and plasma stability. Although the undetermined optimum amount of cholesterol for preparing a stable and controlled release vehicle has been the downside, but researchers are still focused on cholesterol as a promising material for the stability of liposomes necessitating explanation for the stability promotion of liposomes. Herein, the prior art pertaining to the liposomal appliances, especially for drug delivery in cancer therapy, and their stability emphasizing the roles of cholesterol.Liposomes are essentially a subtype of nanoparticles comprising a hydrophobic tail and a hydrophilic head constituting a phospholipid membrane.

        <p>Increasing advances in nanotechnology and nanoscience have raised great hopes in the field of biomedicine. Due to their unique, multifaceted and flexible properties, nanomaterials circumvents many challenges in diverse fields of medicine, including health, diagnosis, and treatment (Liu et al., 2020;Naskar and Kim, 2021), nanoliposomes being one of the most widely used nanoparticles in biomedicine. Liposomes are lipid bilayer spherical membranes that provide both hydrophilic and hydrophobic environments. Adjustability, flexibility, variety of ingredients, ease of functionalization, tunability of the number of layers/sizes, biocompatibility, and biodegradability have turned liposomes into incredible structures in medicine, especially drug delivery (Aguilar-Pérez et al., 2020;Trucillo et al., 2020;Kashapov et al., 2021), most notable use of these structures being in cosmetics and drug delivery. Consequently, various liposome-based products have been commercialized to date, with the approval from United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (Yuba, 2020;Barenholz, 2021). Liposomes, a type of lipid-based nanoparticle, have a great assortment each of which in turn offers unique properties. However, there are still barriers and challenges related to lipid nanoparticles, the most critical being their stability (Yu et al., 2021). In the present review, an attempt has been made to comprehensively deliberate liposomes in terms of structure, function, and stability starting initially with an introduction to lipid structures.Increasing advances in nanotechnology and nanoscience have raised great hopes in the field of biomedicine.

        <p>Liposome structure has been initially described by the British hematologist, Alec D Bangham in 1961. From the terminology point of view, liposome consists of "Lipos" and "Soma," attributed to fat and body, respectively. The cell membrane's bilayer lipid structure has been determined using electron microscope images, proving their unmistakable resemblance to plasmalemma (Dua et al., 2012;Hashemzadeh et al., 2020a). Liposomes were recruited as a drug carrier for the first time in the early 1990s. It has since been concluded that the low percentages inclusion of lipidbonded polymers (called polymer-lipids) in liposomes' structure could increase blood circulation in vivo. Structurally, liposomes are concentric bleeder vesicles in which a membranous lipid bilayer surrounds an aqueous volume. Typically, the bilayer lipid membrane comprise phospholipids containing a hydrophobic tail and a hydrophilic head (Rovira-Bru et al., 2002).Liposome structure has been initially described by the British hematologist, Alec D Bangham in 1961.

According to a concentric form, the bilayer lipid formation arrangement constitutes an equal number of water chambers (Chetoni et al., 2004;Choi and Maibach, 2005;Pavelić et al., 2005).According to the phospholipid's properties, the final structure represents an amphiphilic feature (Dua et al., 2012).

The self-assembly of diacyl-chain phospholipids in aqueous solutions can form spherical bilayer structures referred to as liposomes. Because of encapsulating an extensive aqueous environment, liposomal structures can load almost any type of hydrophilic molecules (Lebègue et al., 2015;Vakili-Ghartavol et al., 2020;Wu et al., 2021). Liposome's internal hydrophilic part can protect loaded drugs from the host body's destructive factors that ultimately minimize the unwanted side effects. Besides the internal aqueous environment, hydrophobic substances can also be embedded between the lipid membranes or adsorb on the liposome surface (Xu et al., 2007;Silverman et al., 2013;Chen et al., 2014;Eloy et al., 2014;Jain et al., 2014).

        <p>Liposomes are highly versatile compounds and they can be fabricated with various combinations, their diversity and properties vary in structure, size, shape, and surface properties. One of the classification types of liposomes is founded on their size and amount of layers, for example, unilamellar and multilamellar liposomes. They can be subdivided into four main categories based on structural parameters: multilamellar liposomes/vesicles (MLV), oligolamellar vesicles (OLV), multilamellar liposomes/vesicles (MVV), and unilamellar vesicles (ULV). Furthermore, the ULV can be divided into giant unilamellar liposomes/vesicles (GUV) groups, large unilamellar liposomes/vesicles (LUV), medium unilamellar vesicles (MUL), and small unilamellar liposomes/vesicles (SUV), and based on size (Walde and Ichikawa, 2001;Gabriëls and Plaizier-Vercammen, 2003;Wagner et al., 2006;Drulis-Kawa and Dorotkiewicz-Jach, 2010;Baykal-Caglar et al., 2012;Garg and K.

Since the introduction of liposomes as lipid-carrying structures, many methods have been proposed for their fabrication. Each has some advantages and disadvantages that can be exploited depending on the practical function. The process of liposome making strongly affects the final properties, so special attention should be paid to the construction method. Liposomes are referred to as a very miscellaneous structure in terms of their charge and size, the ultimate size and electrical charge of the fabricated liposome being highly reliant on the manufacturing method and the types of phospholipid deployed. In this regard, liposomes synthesis methods can be categorized as dehydration and rehydration (DRV), reverse phase evaporation (REV), particularly for SUL, OLV, and MLV liposomes, vesicles prepared by extrusion technique (VET), and frozen and thawed (FAT) for MLV preparation (Zhang and Pawelchak, 2000;Scott and Jones, 2001;Xia and Xu, 2005;Zaru et al., 2007;Akbarzadeh et al., 2013;Pradhan et al., 2015).

        <p>Regarding the production of liposome, in addition to the fabrication method, drug loading should also be considered. In general, drug loading is performed via two standard procedures, passive and active loading, which affects the amount and quality of the loaded drug and some extent on the liposome properties. In the active loading method, known as the remote loading method, the drug molecules are loaded into the fabricated liposome. The pH gradient and electrical potential difference across the liposomal membrane are the most known underlying mechanisms dictating the active drug loading (Figure 1). The active loading method has provided various advantages over passive loading methods, including high efficiency and loading capacity, decreasing the loaded drug's leakage, and reducing the drug's shrinking during storage. Another outstanding feature of this method is the possibility of drug loading after carrier formation due to the use of the flexibility of constitutive lipid. It is also possible to prevent the degradation of the biologically active compounds during the preparative process (Barratt, 2003;Anwekar et al., 2011;Agrawal et al., 2012;Burton et al., 2015).Regarding the production of liposome, in addition to the fabrication method, drug loading should also be considered. In general, drug loading is performed via two standard procedures, passive and active loading, which affects the amount and quality of the loaded drug and some extent on the liposome properties.

        <p>It has been well known that liposome characteristics are highly dependent on lipid composition. Surface charge, particle size, and the preparation method are among the most outstanding influenced features by lipid combination. Besides, the effective properties of bilayer structure, including rigidity, fluidity, and electrical charge, can be determined through bilayer component selection. In this regard, natural-based liposomes fabricated from unsaturated phosphatidylcholine species, including egg or soybean phosphatidylcholine, have provided bilayer structures with highly permeable and low stable properties.

        <p>Another critical factor affecting the stability of liposomes is referred to lipid composition. Studies have shown that controlling solute retention by liposomes and circulation half-life can be strongly affected by liposomal membrane fluidity and composition manipulation. One of the most critical barriers to prevent the transfer of liposomal drugs from the bench scale to the pharmaceutical market is their physical and chemical instability during production and storing.

        <p>In view of the spherical 3-D structure, liposomes have shown more realistic fluidity and cell membrane mobility than lipid monolayers. Sterols, such as ergosterol, stigmasterol, lanosterol, β-sitosterol and cholesterol, have been added to liposomes to modulate membrane fluidity and improve the stability of the phospholipids bilayer and decrease permeation of the encapsulated active compounds. The sterol molecule is located inside the phospholipid's bilayer. The sterol carbohydrate tail at C17 intermingles with the hydrophobic fatty acyl chains, while the sterol hydroxyl group attaches to the hydrophilic head group of phospholipids (Socaciu et al., 2000;Sodt et al., 2015;Zhao et al., 2015;Giulimondi et al., 2019). Cholesterol plays a vital role in the liposome's composition. It is one of the most critical structural components in the mammalian cell plasma membrane. It has been proven that the fluidity and permeability of the artificial vesicle are strongly affected by cholesterol through hydrogen binding to fatty acids that eventually lead to increasing the cohesiveness and mechanical strength. Cholesterol is a critical regulator of lipid bilayer dynamics, and it is essential for the normal functioning of the cells. The reduction of passive permeability to small molecules results from cholesterol interaction with membrane phospholipids, increasing the membrane cohesion. According to experimental studies, cholesterol adding to liposome bilayers can prevent lipid exchange that can be counted as an additional stabilizing effect (Sun et al., 2007;Ricci et al., 2016;Trucillo et al., 2017).In view of the spherical 3-D structure, liposomes have shown more realistic fluidity and cell membrane mobility than lipid monolayers.

        <p>Another significant factor in the arrangement of bilayers in the liposome is the degree of saturation in phospholipids and the chain length. The presence of sterols such as cholesterol, β-sitosterol, and related plant sterols can lead to the pretransition temperature peak's disappearance. The gel-to-liquid crystalline phase Tm has been reported to decrease by addition of the sterols. It can be stated that the orientation of cholesterol in the lipid bilayer has a determinative effect on the reduction of head group accumulation. In the low Tm, cholesterol leads to the crystallization of the hydrocarbon chains into the inflexible crystalline gel phase. While in the high Tm, the rigid cholesterol molecule can limit the movement of the hydrocarbon chains. It can be concluded that, by increasing the sterol concentration, decreases the enthalpy of the main phase transition (Silva et al., 2011;Wu et al., 2012;Ricci et al., 2016).Another significant factor in the arrangement of bilayers in the liposome is the degree of saturation in phospholipids and the chain length.

        <p>For example, in the case of the PC molecule, it has been stated that cholesterol at concentrations of more than 25% leads to an order-liquid phase, which is essential for the mobility of membrane compounds; inferred that cholesterol at high concentrations causes the decouples of positional and conformational degrees of freedom of phospholipid molecules. On the other hand, at low cholesterol concentrations below 10%, its effect on the bilayer phospholipid is very different; only a slight decrease in the Tm, the main phase transfer occurs. This means that cholesterol at low concentrations cannot disrupt the crystalline order, nor can it ultimately induce the acyl chains in the liquid phase. Cholesterol, therefore, functions as a surfactant molecule, which causes the formation of lipid domains thus increasing the dynamic membrane heterogeneity (Trandum et al., 2000;Pinilla et al., 2020).For example, in the case of the PC molecule, it has been stated that cholesterol at concentrations of more than 25% leads to an order-liquid phase, which is essential for the mobility of membrane compounds; inferred that cholesterol at high concentrations causes the decouples of positional and conformational degrees of freedom of phospholipid molecules.

It is believed that the underlying mechanism in a biological milieu may be related to the phospholipid and high-density lipoproteins exchange of the low-cholesterol or no-cholesterol content liposomes while in cholesterol-encompassing liposomes, the phospholipid motility has been limited that prevents lipoproteins loss (Kunzelmann-Marche et al., 2002;Liu and Krieger, 2002;López-Revuelta et al., 2006).The cholesterol content has a critical role in drug retention as it implies its effect by raising the phospholipid packing, leading to bilayer permeability reduction to non-electrolytic and dielectrolysis solvents (Dos Santos et al., 2002;Johnston et al., 2007).

        <p>The phospholipid packing, the membrane fluidity, and the surface charge of liposomes can be modulated and adapted by the cholesterol content, affecting the particle size, encapsulation efficiency, and final morphology (Zhao et al., 2015;Ohvo-RekilÃ et al., 2002). Studies have shown that cholesterol as a nonionic molecule has revealed interesting effects on the zeta potential, especially increasing the highest zeta potential of cationic liposomes. The proposed mechanism is reliant on the membrane structure transition and the molecular filling state for the cholesterol-induced charge boosting of cationic liposomes. Cholesterol can induce the phase transition from the crystalline state to the liquid-ordered (LO) phase (Lv et al., 2006;Aramaki et al., 2016). Increasing the amount of cholesterol content in the membrane of liposomes can increase the mean size of liposomes. Due to the hydrophobic nature, cholesterol structure can easily interact with the phospholipid hydrophobic acyl chain through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. The ring structure of cholesterol is comparatively inflexible, and its presence stabilizes the protracted straight-chain arrangement of saturated fatty acids via van der Waals interactions (Lee et al., 2005).The phospholipid packing, the membrane fluidity, and the surface charge of liposomes can be modulated and adapted by the cholesterol content, affecting the particle size, encapsulation efficiency, and final morphology (Zhao et al., 2015;Ohvo-RekilÃ et al., 2002).

        <p>Cholesterol has a very significant effect on the structural stability of liposomes in plasma (Figure 4). It can reduce the interaction of liposomes with several proteins, leading to less susceptibility to phospholipase, reduce the phospholipid's loss of high-density lipoproteins, change the membrane enzyme activities, inhibit digestion by macrophages, and inhibit fusion with specific cell types. By changing some liposome features through composition, mostly cholesterol modification, blood clearance and tissue distribution of intravenously injected liposomes can be expected. The cholesterol modification of liposomes has an inhibitory effect on the reticuloendothelial uptake. This modification reduces their interaction with several proteins and probably with serum components, which may affect liposomes' tissue uptake (D'Avanzo et al., 2011;Johnstone et al., 2001;Moghimi and Patel, 2002). The cholesterol-based liposomal products are presented in Table 7.Cholesterol has a very significant effect on the structural stability of liposomes in plasma (Figure 4).

        <p>The importance of cholesterol in liposome stability has been described earlier and schematically shows in Figure 3. However, the optimum concentration of cholesterol to attain a suitable formulation has not yet been elucidated. To make stable and regulated drug discharge means, lipids and cholesterol ratio screening arrangements in different studies can help. For the preparation of liposomes, some phospholipids are blended with varying molar ratios of cholesterol. The results of numerous studies have shown that the maximum amount of cholesterol that can be integrated into reconstructed bilayers is assumed to be ∼50 mol%. The most frequently used proportion is the 2: 1 ratio (e.g., two parts of lipids and one part of cholesterol) or 1: 1 ratio; although the underlying reasons for using these ratios is still unknown (Marsh, 2001;Liang et al., 2007;Briuglia et al., 2015).The importance of cholesterol in liposome stability has been described earlier and schematically shows in Figure 3.

        <p>Unlike most nanoparticles, which encounter serious challenges in entering the clinic for various reasons, including safety issues, liposomes are well accepted in the clinic, first liposome-based drug being approved was Doxil ® [ (Anselmo and Mitragotri, 2015;Bulbake et al., 2017;Singh et al., 2020)], a liposome-based Doxorubicin formulation that has been FDA approved in 1995 for the United States market to treat ovarian cancer and AIDSrelated Kaposi's sarcoma. Subsequently, various other liposomalbased drugs have been commercialized, such as DaunoXome ® , for the delivery of daunorubicin, approved in 1996 to manage advanced HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma and several different formulations (Khadke et al., 2020).Unlike most nanoparticles, which encounter serious challenges in entering the clinic for various reasons, including safety issues, liposomes are well accepted in the clinic, first liposome-based drug being approved was Doxil ® [ (Anselmo and Mitragotri, 2015;Bulbake et al., 2017;Singh et al., 2020)], a liposome-based Doxorubicin formulation that has been FDA approved in 1995 for the United States market to treat ovarian cancer and AIDSrelated Kaposi's sarcoma.

        <p>Currently, many efforts are underway to develop lipid formulations for entry in to the clinics in various fields. To examine the clinical phase studies of liposome-based structures, the term "liposome" was searched from the PubMed database pertaining to various studies related to the clinical phases in the last year. In one study, the effect of liposomal amphotericin B formulation as an antifungal agent was investigated in patients with hematological malignancies with neutropenia and persistent fever (Yoshida et al., 2020). Because fungal infections subsequent to the chemotherapy in patients with neutropenia are considered a severe complication, and as the use of common antifungal drugs is highly toxic, so eliminating this life-threatening complication is very important. The usage of 3 mg/kg/day liposomal amphotericin B concentration for patients was compared with itraconazole; results showed no difference between the liposomal amphotericin B and itraconazole regarding the efficacy and safety in antifungal therapy in hematological malignancy patients (Yoshida et al., 2020).Currently, many efforts are underway to develop lipid formulations for entry in to the clinics in various fields.

        <p>Health and medical issues and problems have always been one of the main areas of interest for scientists. Applying new methods for solving medical problems requires introducing new and efficient materials and tools that address related questions and issues. Liposomes have been extensively studied since their introduction, and their potential biomedical use has been well demonstrated. The unique properties of liposomes, including biocompatibility, biodegradability, amphiphilic nature, low toxicity, non-ionicity, sustained release, and active targeting, have made them one of the most widely used nanoparticles. Currently, the most commercialized nanoparticles in the field of drug delivery and cosmetics are related to liposomes. However, they still have some shortcomings that need to be addressed for clinical and pharmaceutical use. As mentioned earlier, since Doxil ® introduced in 1995, many efforts have been made to bring these versatile nanomaterials to the clinic; however, their structure still needs to be optimized to reduce some complications. One approach to increase liposomes' efficiency, especially concerning cancers therapy, is the use of RGD which can be anchored to liposome surfaces or via self-assembly means (Cheng and Ji, 2019). This strategy has been proposed to reduce the side effects of liposomal drugs, as the clinical trial sometimes suffers from, including acute infusion reaction and hand-foot syndrome (HFS). Hence future studies must include new procedures to reduce safety problems (He and Tang, 2018;Cheng and Ji, 2019). Since varying combinations of liposomes can provide unique and distinctive properties, exciting suggestions have been propositioned in the field of novel drug delivery systems, such as nose-to-brain direct drug transport using liposome formulation based on DTE and DTP ingredients (Hong et al., 2019).Health and medical issues and problems have always been one of the main areas of interest for scientists.

        <p>However, one of the most critical challenges that liposomes encounter is their physical and chemical instability. Various factors such as environmental conditions, manufacturing method, components characteristics, lipid type, and the absence or presence of cholesterol affect liposomes' stability. The vital need for the development of liposomes with high stability significantly impacts their clinical application. Cholesterol has been shown to increase liposome stability through various mechanisms, including increased retention time, modulating phospholipid packing, Tm, and plasma stability. However, the optimal amount of cholesterol has not yet been identified. Future field research should be based on the principle of finding the optimal amount of cholesterol in liposome production. Notably, cholesterol still tend to maintain membrane's fluidity as its concentration is increased and decreased. Therefore, the amount of cholesterol and the type of liposome constituents need further investigation. In this context, simulation and computational studies may prove to be very helpful. Hashemzadeh et al. (2020a) have investigated DSPC and DPSM effect on liposome stability through a simulation study which revealed that DSPC preserves its structure shape due to the cylindrical geometric structure and small-size head group, while the DPSM was causing liposome turnover into micelle structure because of its conical geometric design with the larger head group. Such studies regarding cholesterol's effect on liposome stability via simulation investigations would be highly desirable.However, one of the most critical challenges that liposomes encounter is their physical and chemical instability.
