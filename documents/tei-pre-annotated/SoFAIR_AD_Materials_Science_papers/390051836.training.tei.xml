        <p>Nanotheranostics is one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs in nanomedicine. Most of the currently available diagnosis and therapies are invasive, time-consuming and associated with severe toxic side effects. Nanotheranostics, on the other hand, has the potential to bridge this gap by harnessing the capabilities of nanotechnology and nanomaterials for combined therapeutics and diagnostics with markedly enhanced efficacy. However, nanomaterial applications in nanotheranostics are still in its infancy. This is due to the fact that each disease has a particular microenvironment with well-defined characteristics, which promotes deeper selection criteria of nanomaterials to meet the disease needs. In this review, we have outlined how nanomaterials are designed and tailored for nanotheranostics of cancer, and other diseases such as neurodegenerative, autoimmune (particularly on rheumatoid arthritis) and cardiovascular diseases. The penetrability and retention of a nanomaterial in the biological system, the therapeutic strategy used and the imaging mode selected are some of the aspects discussed for each disease. The specific properties of the nanomaterials in terms of feasibility, physicochemical challenges, progress in clinical trials, its toxicity and their future application on translational medicine are addressed. Our review meticulously and critically examines the applications of nanotheranostics with various nanomaterials, including graphene, across several diseases; offering a broader perspective of this emerging field.Nanotheranostics is one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs in nanomedicine.

        <p>nanotheranostics, nanomaterials, cancer, solid tumor, liquid tumor, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases, clinical trials, graphene John Funkhouser, the PharmaNetics president and CEO, was credited by scientists in year 2002 for introducing the term theranostics (a portmanteau of Therapeutics and Diagnostics), which epitomes the development of nanoparticle system for personalized medicine. 1,2 Theranostics (or theragnostics) refers to comprehensive effort that integrates diagnostic and therapy in a single system/platform. 3,4 With the emergence of nanotechnologies and nanomaterials, the concept of nanotheranostics was then introduced (Figure 1). Nanotheranostics was able to provide non-invasive imaging, targeting and therapy at the disease sites, without affecting surrounding healthy cells. 3,5 Hence, the use of empirical treatment can be avoided (therapy given based on experience, usually without a prior definitive medical diagnosis and likely to cause infectious disease), greatly improve the prognoses and subsequently expedite clinician's therapeutic decisions. Therefore, early diagnosis will increase the patient's survival rate, and the optimized treatment will contribute to high therapeutic efficiency along with best safety profile. 3,6 Furthermore, over-dosing of drugs and cost of treatment can be effectively reduced.nanotheranostics, nanomaterials, cancer, solid tumor, liquid tumor, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases, clinical trials, graphene John Funkhouser, the PharmaNetics president and CEO, was credited by scientists in year 2002 for introducing the term theranostics (a portmanteau of Therapeutics and Diagnostics), which epitomes the development of nanoparticle system for personalized medicine. 1,2 Theranostics (or theragnostics) refers to comprehensive effort that integrates diagnostic and therapy in a single system/platform. 3,4 With the emergence of nanotechnologies and nanomaterials, the concept of nanotheranostics was then introduced (Figure 1).

        <p>can be made up of different chemical constructs: targeting moiety (for specific cellular binding), therapeutic agents (for drug delivery), diagnostic agents (for non-invasive imaging), and polymer coating or matrix that imparts colloidal stability and provide functional groups for bio-conjugation. 3,6 Some of the important advantages of nanomaterials are undoubtedly their small size and large functional surface area to volume ratio, in addition to interesting optical and electrical properties. These properties allow the diagnostic and therapeutic agent to be adsorbed, dissolved or covalently attached to the surface, to form nanoparticledrug/imaging/targeting complexes. 10 The complex can subsequently signal (diagnostics) and deliver the agents to the cancer cells or other targeted sites to perform the therapy. 11,12 Ideally, after the controlled release of encapsulated drug molecules, the residual nanoparticle will be safely degraded and excreted from the body. 10 Recently, the application of nanomaterials with multiple physical imaging modalities and therapeutic capabilities has received increasing attention.

        <p>In this review, we stratify the information on the basis of cancer-or disease-specific, enabling comprehensive comparison of the nanomaterials for theranostics of up to three different diseases. Specifically, we focus on the nanotheranostics of cancer (including solid and liquid tumor) and several diseases: neurodegenerative, autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases (see Table 1). The physiochemical properties of various nanomaterials, including graphene, a rising star in the 21 st century, have been critically reviewed. We also discuss the physical and biological barriers that impede application of nanotheranostics in vivo, and provide an overview of different nanomaterials that are currently in clinical trials. A future outlook of this rapidly growing field will be given as a conclusion. By putting this information together, this review may shed light on understanding nanomaterials for nanotheranostics while we are expecting continuous breakthrough in this field.In this review, we stratify the information on the basis of cancer-or disease-specific, enabling comprehensive comparison of the nanomaterials for theranostics of up to three different diseases.

        <p>When nanomaterials circulate throughout the body they are exposed to a complex fluid containing blood, lymph, biomolecules, cytoplasm, etc. 21,22 Protein and other biomolecules such as albumin, transferrin, gamma globulin and fibrinogen, will compete for binding on the surface of nanomaterials. This will slightly change the secondary structure of the proteins and lead to the formation of both soft and hard protein corona. [22][23][24] Formation of protein corona on nanomaterials will affect the surface of nanomaterials and their subsequent interaction with biological molecules (biodistribution and penetrance) and cellular compartments. 18,25 The composition, properties and formation of protein corona are influenced by physiochemical properties (size, shape, surface area, charge, chemical composition, functionalization, colloidal stability, porosity, etc.) of nanomaterials. Nanomaterials could exert both positive (act as carriers to immobilize enzyme, improve activity and stability of proteins) and negative impacts (induce potential toxicity to cells and organs) on proteins. 26 Supramolecularly built protein corona can also be exploited to shield nanomaterials' interaction with serum proteins and macrophages while retaining its targeting specificity in vitro and in vivo. 24 Positively charged nanomaterials facilitate cellular uptake and improve lysosomal escape without induction of toxicity, showing more specific interaction with negatively charged biological membranes. 18 Single-layer and multi-layered graphene oxide have been proven to exhibit different behaviors in cell culture medium. 27 The various types of carbon nanomaterials (fullerene, carbon nanotubes, graphene and their derivatives) have particular effects on the structure or activity of the proteins. For instance, the graphene sheet has a stronger adsorption capacity for serum proteins than carbon nanotubes. Yet, the enzymatic degradation of graphene and fullerenes derivatives is much complicated than carbon nanotubes. 26 The individual and in combination properties of nanomaterials play an important role in determining their path, biological effect and immunological fate in biological systems.When nanomaterials circulate throughout the body they are exposed to a complex fluid containing blood, lymph, biomolecules, cytoplasm, etc. 21,22 Protein and other biomolecules such as albumin, transferrin, gamma globulin and fibrinogen, will compete for binding on the surface of nanomaterials.

        <p>One of the factors for low drug-delivery efficacy to the tumor and low therapeutic outcomes is due to the MPS. The MPS mainly involves liver, spleen and lymph nodes. MPS serves as a delivery barrier for invading pathogens, particulates and dead or damaged host cells. 28 Among the MPS, Kupffer cells are the major phagocytic cells (e.g. macrophages) residing inside the liver sinusoid. 23 In principle, cationic nanomaterials have higher affinity for macrophages than neutral and anionic nanomaterials. 23 Attachment of surface protein, such as opsonins on the nanomaterials may increase the chance of nanomaterials being recognized by the scavenger receptors on the Kupffer cells. This will result in opsonisation and subsequent phagocytosis. 18,19,23 The nanomaterials will be ultimately taken up and cleared by macrophages. Generally, MPS cuts off more than 95 % of the administered nanomaterials. 23 Mammalian cells engulf intracellular contents using autophagosome, a double-membrane vesicle, fuse with lysosomes, and later degrade or recycle the autophagic contents. This process is known as autophagy. 25 Autophagy is vital in maintaining the homeostasis of cells. Dysregulation of autophagy in degrading overexpressed prions proteins may lead to neurodegenerative disorders; while active autophagy aids in chemotherapeutic treatments of cancer cells. 25 Fe3O4 NPs were found to have the ability to induce autophagy in human cervical carcinoma cells. Positive correlations between size/molecular weight of protein and adsorption of protein on a 20 nm Fe3O4 NPs were confirmed. 25 However, the higher the adsorption of protein on Fe3O4 NPs, the lower the cell uptake of NPs and consequently lower cell autophagy responses. 25 An increase in the dosage of nanomaterials, on the other hand, raises toxicity concerns induced by the accumulation of nanomaterials in organs such as liver and spleen. 23 Solvents and chemicals involved during the synthesis of nanomaterials are one of the causes of toxicity in vivo. 17 Their long-term cytotoxicity and related immune response should be taken into consideration.One of the factors for low drug-delivery efficacy to the tumor and low therapeutic outcomes is due to the MPS.

        <p>Four strategies (surface modification, tuning of physiochemical properties of nanomaterials, biomimetic design inspired by nature and modulation of the MPS) have been identified to oppose uptake by the MPS, lower off-target rate and enhance cancer therapeutic efficacy. 23 For instance, modifying the surface of nanomaterials with zwitterions, polyethylene glycol, carbohydrate moieties and dysopsonic proteins allow bypass of phagocyte-mediated cellular barriers, which in turn increases nanomaterials blood circulation time and theranostics efficacy. 24 Another interesting strategy to protect the nanomaterials from phagocytosis is by using the extracts of cell membranes from blood or tumor cells. The extracts can be used to coat the nanomaterials, camouflaging the nanomaterials from uptake by the MPS.Four strategies (surface modification, tuning of physiochemical properties of nanomaterials, biomimetic design inspired by nature and modulation of the MPS) have been identified to oppose uptake by the MPS, lower off-target rate and enhance cancer therapeutic efficacy. 23 For instance, modifying the surface of nanomaterials with zwitterions, polyethylene glycol, carbohydrate moieties and dysopsonic proteins allow bypass of phagocyte-mediated cellular barriers, which in turn increases nanomaterials blood circulation time and theranostics efficacy. 24 Another interesting strategy to protect the nanomaterials from phagocytosis is by using the extracts of cell membranes from blood or tumor cells.

        <p>Tumor microenvironment is generally composed of tumor cells, the extracellular matrix, stromal cells, cells from the immune systems (macrophages, lymphocytes, natural killer cells), etc. 12,19 Macrophages act as immune cells to maintain immunohomeostasis. The failure of existing therapies is mainly attributed to the tumor microenvironment limiting drug access to the tumor cells. 12,29 This is because upon entering through the blood vessel leakage, nanomaterials would interact with the microenvironment factors.Tumor microenvironment is generally composed of tumor cells, the extracellular matrix, stromal cells, cells from the immune systems (macrophages, lymphocytes, natural killer cells), etc. 12,19 Macrophages act as immune cells to maintain immunohomeostasis.

        <p>The intratumoral microenvironment serves as a physical and biological barrier for the delivery of therapeutic nanomaterial to the solid tumor (e.g. pancreatic cancer). 18 In normal tissues, the extracellular matrix is loose and elastic, with sufficient oxygen supply, and the overall redox environment is homeostasis. 30 In contrast, the basement membrane in the tumor is thicker, with higher cross-linked extracellular matrix, hypoxic, acidic and has harsh redox environment. 31,32 Differentiated macrophages, named as M2-type tumor-associated macrophages, will trap and degrade the functional nanomaterials delivered into the tumor. 30 High tumor interstitial fluid pressure will also force the nanomaterials back to blood circulation, further preventing them from reaching the tumor sites. 30 These pathophysiological properties greatly impede intratumoral delivery of nanomaterials.The intratumoral microenvironment serves as a physical and biological barrier for the delivery of therapeutic nanomaterial to the solid tumor (e.g. pancreatic cancer). 18 In normal tissues, the extracellular matrix is loose and elastic, with sufficient oxygen supply, and the overall redox environment is homeostasis. 30 In contrast, the basement membrane in the tumor is thicker, with higher cross-linked extracellular matrix, hypoxic, acidic and has harsh redox environment. 31,32 Differentiated macrophages, named as M2-type tumor-associated macrophages, will trap and degrade the functional nanomaterials delivered into the tumor. 30 High tumor interstitial fluid pressure will also force the nanomaterials back to blood circulation, further preventing them from reaching the tumor sites. 30 These pathophysiological properties greatly impede intratumoral delivery of nanomaterials.</p>

        <p>Cancer is a broad name given to the diseases featured with uncontrolled rapid cell division that may form growths called tumors. Nobel Laureate Otto Warburg discovered that low oxygen was a hallmark of cancer cells. Cancer cells "reprogram" themselves under stressful conditions (lack of oxygen, limited nutrient resources or energy, etc.), with a faster growth rate than the rate of new blood vessel formation. 35,36 Cancer can be further classified into solid and liquid tumors, each with differences in terms of their tumor vascularity and heterogeneity, thus requiring different diagnostic and targeting strategies. 37 For centuries, surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy remain as the most common cancer therapies. However, these few alternatives often come with the possibility of recurrence after the treatment (since not all cancer cells can be completely removed by surgery), severe toxic side effects (chemotherapy and radiotherapy) and limited specificities to cancer cells. 38,39 Due to their low molecular weight, conventional chemotherapeutic drugs generally have low half-lives in the blood and are rapidly distributed in healthy tissues and organs, limiting their therapeutic efficacy. 40 Furthermore, the use of centralized diagnostic platform in most of the cancer management can be complex, time-consuming and not tailored to patients and malignancies. 37 Theranostic nanomedicine possess the ability for specific cancer biomarker detection and concurrent cancer cells ablation, in a simple and non-invasive way, making them suitable candidates for nanotheranostics. 37 For instance, the nanomedicine can be delivered and accumulated at the tumor sites to perform therapeutic action. Yet, the drug delivery is still limited in poorly vascularized regions, some cancer cells are able to continue proliferating. 10,39 In contrast, liquid tumors (such as leukemia and lymphoma) are spread throughout the bloodstream, its diagnostics and therapies are often challenged by poor selectivity, low therapeutic efficacy, multi-drug resistance and long-term side effects. 37 Tumor microenvironment varies between cancer types of different or the same anatomical region. 12 The discovery of the right diagnostics and therapeutics intervention is highly important in cancer treatments.Cancer is a broad name given to the diseases featured with uncontrolled rapid cell division that may form growths called tumors.

        <p>Solid tumor is an abnormal mass of tissues, may be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Examples of solid tumors are carcinomas (tumors formed in epithelial cells) and sarcomas (tumors in blood vessels, bones, fat tissues, muscles, etc.). Hypoxia, a condition in which the body tissues are deprived of oxygen, mainly due to the disorganized vasculature and poor blood circulation, is an important characteristic of solid tumors. 41,42 The hypoxia microenvironment may confer the resistance of tumors to cancer treatment, 31 especially photodynamic therapy (PDT), an externally activable and oxygendependent therapeutic modality. 38 PDT works by using cytotoxic oxygen species (such as singlet oxygen or reactive oxygen species (ROS)) generated from photosensitizer molecules upon light exposure, which destruct tissue structure and subsequently kill cancer cells. 41 Besides, solid tumors are 2-3 times more radio-resistant than normoxic tumors. 43 Hence, the hypoxic and radio-resistance nature of solid tumors cause the cancer treatment even more challenging. 44 Intracellular environment of tumor cells is also rich in hydrogen ions (H + ) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) due to rapid glycolytic metabolism and superoxide dismutase overexpression. 45 This contributes to the weakly acidic extracellular pH (pH 6.0-6.8) in tumors, in contrast to weakly basic normal tissues (pH 7.2-7.4). 5,41 Hence, an ideal solid tumor theranostic nanomaterial should be sensitive enough to respond to the minute difference in extracellular pH between blood and tumors. 46 Other common cancer phenotypes are high abundance of antioxidants and elevated glutathione (GSH) level (about 4-fold higher than normal cells). 5,39,42 In addition, the original size of the nanocarrier should be maintained below 160 nm for optimum deposition on the tumor tissues and exploit the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. 47 EPR is a phenomenon where nanomedicine leaks preferentially into tumor tissue, through the permeable tumor vasculature. The nanomedicine will be retained in the tumor bed owing to the reduced lymphatic drainage. 36,48 EPR effect aids in the delivery (with a relatively modest effect of less than a 2-fold increase) and accumulation of nanomedicine at the solid tumors, and subsequently improves the therapeutic efficacy. 23,32,49 The potential side effects are greatly reduced, since there is very low accumulation of nanomedicine within the normal tissue. 36 The ability of the NPs to cluster into large size aggregates after successful cellular internalization could prevent the lysosomal exocytosis, which may minimize the loss of their therapeutic activity. 47 Nevertheless, the drug delivery remains limited in poorly vascularized regions of the tumors, some cancer cells are still able to survive. 10,18,32 Also, the efficiency of EPR effect is highly dependent on cancer type. 18 Researchers have been putting efforts to design and tailor different stimuli-responsive nanomaterials to overcome multiple biological and physiological barriers in drug delivery, and simultaneously serve as a nanotheranostic platform for cancer. The following section provides comprehensive review on the nanotheranostic features of each nanomaterial, together with their advantages and limitations.Solid tumor is an abnormal mass of tissues, may be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).

Hypoxia, a condition in which the body tissues are deprived of oxygen, mainly due to the disorganized vasculature and poor blood circulation, is an important characteristic of solid tumors. 41,42 The hypoxia microenvironment may confer the resistance of tumors to cancer treatment, 31 especially photodynamic therapy (PDT), an externally activable and oxygendependent therapeutic modality. 38 PDT works by using cytotoxic oxygen species (such as singlet oxygen or reactive oxygen species (ROS)) generated from photosensitizer molecules upon light exposure, which destruct tissue structure and subsequently kill cancer cells. 41 Besides, solid tumors are 2-3 times more radio-resistant than normoxic tumors. 43 Hence, the hypoxic and radio-resistance nature of solid tumors cause the cancer treatment even more challenging. 44 Intracellular environment of tumor cells is also rich in hydrogen ions (H + ) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) due to rapid glycolytic metabolism and superoxide dismutase overexpression. 45 This contributes to the weakly acidic extracellular pH (pH 6.0-6.8) in tumors, in contrast to weakly basic normal tissues (pH 7.2-7.4). 5,41 Hence, an ideal solid tumor theranostic nanomaterial should be sensitive enough to respond to the minute difference in extracellular pH between blood and tumors. 46 Other common cancer phenotypes are high abundance of antioxidants and elevated glutathione (GSH) level (about 4-fold higher than normal cells). 5,39,42 In addition, the original size of the nanocarrier should be maintained below 160 nm for optimum deposition on the tumor tissues and exploit the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. 47 EPR is a phenomenon where nanomedicine leaks preferentially into tumor tissue, through the permeable tumor vasculature. The nanomedicine will be retained in the tumor bed owing to the reduced lymphatic drainage. 36,48 EPR effect aids in the delivery (with a relatively modest effect of less than a 2-fold increase) and accumulation of nanomedicine at the solid tumors, and subsequently improves the therapeutic efficacy. 23,32,49 The potential side effects are greatly reduced, since there is very low accumulation of nanomedicine within the normal tissue. 36 The ability of the NPs to cluster into large size aggregates after successful cellular internalization could prevent the lysosomal exocytosis, which may minimize the loss of their therapeutic activity. 47 Nevertheless, the drug delivery remains limited in poorly vascularized regions of the tumors, some cancer cells are still able to survive. 10,18,32 Also, the efficiency of EPR effect is highly dependent on cancer type. 18 Researchers have been putting efforts to design and tailor different stimuli-responsive nanomaterials to overcome multiple biological and physiological barriers in drug delivery, and simultaneously serve as a nanotheranostic platform for cancer. The following section provides comprehensive review on the nanotheranostic features of each nanomaterial, together with their advantages and limitations.</p>
        <p>Gold (Au) nanostructure is a collective term given to different shape of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). It has received increasing attention for being able to provide a versatile and multifaceted platform for biomedical applications. 38,[49][50][51] Apart from having excellent biocompatibility and facile surface chemical features, Au nanostructures are able to act as photothermal transducers. They are capable of absorbing visible or NIR radiation and then convert them into heat with high efficiency to destroy nearby biological structures (coined as photothermal therapy, PTT). 31,41,42,45,47 The potential side effects of using Au nanostructures for cancer treatment can be reduced to minimum by controlling the intensity of light and amount of injected nanomaterials, making it a highly selective material in cancer treatment. 17,[52][53][54][55] Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a type of solid tumor, is the most common primary liver cancer. 56 Being the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide, HCC has often been chosen as the focus of many clinical research. 57,58 HCC tumors, like other solid tumors, have scant stroma and necrosis in the central area due to poor vascularization. HCC is nodular and can either appear as a single solitary tumor with a large mass or multiple small tumors. 56 A tumor microenvironment responsive and triple-synergistic therapeutic nanoplatform based on AuNPs with Cu (II)-aptamer complexes has been developed for HCC treatment [Figure 2a (ii)]. 41 Aptamer is a small and easy to synthesize secondary structure ligand made up of single DNA or RNA sequence. Aptamers confer lower immunogenicity and have high targeting affinity to cell surface receptors, 59 whereas chlorin e6 (Ce6) is a widely used photosensitiser. 38,60 Possessing high singlet oxygen generation capability, Ce6 labelled aptamer has been chosen to specifically target the HCC cells and activate PDT. The binding of Ce6 labelled aptamer onto AuNPs not only avoids rapid clearance of AuNPs from the body, but also serves as a cargo for the Cu (II) coordinated chemotherapeutic prodrug AQ4N (or banoxantrone, a hypoxia activated prodrug to enhance anti-tumor effects). The high level of intracellular GSH and acidic extracellular pH in cancerous cells induce the release of the AQ4N. The electrostatic aggregation of AuNPs induced by the free Cu (II) also switches on the PTT effects to ablate solid tumors. This system successfully permits the synergistic PDT/PTT/chemotherapy of HCC by single laser irradiation at 670 nm. 41 However, this approach has some limitations especially when selecting AQ4N as the prodrug. Since AQ4N has ultra-high aqueous solubility (260 mg/mL), large dose and multiple dosing (≥ 100 mg/kg) are required during combination therapy. 61 Although the potential side effects of AQ4N loaded nanomedicines have not been reported thus far, low AQ4N loading content and encapsulation efficiency, non-specific release and short-term in vivo retention time (half-life in vivo ≤ 6 h) are some of the concerns.Gold (Au) nanostructure is a collective term given to different shape of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs).

        <p>On the other hand, it is technically difficult to keep photoirradiation localized only on cancer cells due to uncontrollable distribution of the photothermal agents in the intracellular microenvironment. 62 Alternatively, laser beam allows precise focusing to a tiny region of tumor cells. It has therefore been used as a stimulus to cross-link photothermal AuNPs covalently with the surface diazirine groups of polyethylene glycol (PEG) ligands [see Figure 2a (i)]. 63 Upon 405 nm laser irradiation, diazirine groups generate a highly active carbene intermediate that can form covalent bonds with ligands within close proximity of AuNPs. The interparticle cross-linking of AuNPs has significantly improved photothermal ablation effects, with an optical-thermal conversion efficiency of about 78.8 % as compared to 21.6 % for the noncross-linked AuNPs. This innovative approach has effectively shifted the surface plasmon resonance of 20.5 nm AuNPs to NIR region. It was also noted that the as-synthesized photocross-linked AuNPs have longer blood circulation time and shorter biological half-life than particle aggregates. 63 Nevertheless, the penetration depth of 405 nm laser remains limited. In fact, for in vivo imaging application, the chosen NPs need to have the ability to be imaged at greater tissue penetration depth (including thick bone penetration for imaging of brain tumors, air-filled cavities for imaging of lung tumors, etc.), without compromising the spatial resolution. 17,39,64 NIR shows better penetration depth in the tissue than visible light, yet, its clinical utility is still hindered due to auto-fluorescence, potential blink, scattering and photobleaching effects in various tissues. 54,59 In fact, it is difficult to compare and evaluate the efficacy of different Au nanostructures in nanotheranostics, as their behavior is highly dependent on various parameters, such as size, shape and surface functional group. 65 Au nanocages, with cubic shape, are particularly attractive as photothermal transducers for nanotherapeutics, owing to their interesting features such as flexible tuning of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) peaks to any wavelength of interest (in the range of 600-1200 nm) and a large NIR absorption cross section (five orders of magnitude greater than the conventional organic dyes). With a compact size of about 40 nm, the hollow and porous structures of Au nanocages permit drug encapsulation with controlled release upon irradiation with NIR light. 52 In another study, it was reported that cationic NPs exhibit superior cellular internalization, but inferior systemic circulation compared to their anionic and neutral counterparts 46 . In view of this, the idea of integration of photothermal Au nanocages with zwitterionic stealth ligand has been proposed. As aforementioned, zwitterionic medication endows NPs with surface properties resistant to aggregation, binding plasma proteins and macrophage uptake, prolonging blood circulation time. 59 Zwitterionic polymers coated on Au nanocages has successfully extended the NPs' systemic circulation lifetime by 4-fold, without compromising its cellular internalization, breast tumor targeting ability and PTT efficacy.On the other hand, it is technically difficult to keep photoirradiation localized only on cancer cells due to uncontrollable distribution of the photothermal agents in the intracellular microenvironment. 62 Alternatively, laser beam allows precise focusing to a tiny region of tumor cells.

        <p>Triggering of this charge reversal makes the NPs attach to the surface of cancer cells, leading to targeted accumulation within tumors. 46 Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women and has the fourth highest mortality rate (among cancers in women). 66 Additionally, it is a solid tumor associated with human papillomavirus infection. 66 An example of synergistic PTT and drug delivery for cervical cancer is the use of multi-layered single-walled carbon nanotubes, termed SWNT@BSA@Au-S-PEG-FA@DOX, which was prepared using a facile layer-by-layer assembly process. 67 Carbon nanotubes display hemodynamic properties as its shape greatly affects its circulation time and biodistribution. 68 For example, the needle-like morphology of nanotubes contributes to increased specific area for interaction with plasma proteins and cells; permits cell penetration via both endocytosis and diffusion across the plasma membrane; and allows longer circulation time (up to 10 times longer) in blood, as compared to spherical nanomaterials. 69 Coating of bovine serum albumin (BSA) on oxidized and cutsingle-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) provides abundant active sites for the nucleation of Au seeds, subsequently converting Au into AuNPs by in situ reduction. Possessing ideal photothermal properties, the SWNT@BSA@Au was further modified with folic acid terminated-polyglycol (FA-PEG-SH), which endows the material with high waterdispersibility, biocompatibility and selectivity towards human cervical cancer cells. Doxorubicin (DOX) was subsequently loaded onto the system, with a high loading ratio of up to 590 %. The resulting complex exhibited high efficacy, especially when combined with PPT (irradiation of the tumor with a 808 nm laser, 1 W/cm 2 or 5 min, 24 h after systemic injection of the nanomedicine). Besides, release of DOX is induced by the pH value and temperature in the tumor microenvironment, adding selectivity to the system. The system completely eradicated tumors in vivo without systemic toxicity, as substantiated by several hematological and biochemical parameters and histopathological analysis. 67 However, it is of utmost importance to note that the usage of high laser irradiance (1-48 W/cm 2 ) is practically not applicable for clinical treatment of tumors, as they exceed the skin tolerance threshold values (maximum permissible exposure of skin at 808 nm is 350 mW/cm 2 , with an exposure time of 10-1000 s). 70 Future studies can be focused on the interactions between SWNTs and actual biological environment such as blood, since the presence of protein corona in the biological fluids might affect the BSA coatings on SWNTs and subsequently modulate their biological fate. 69 Gold nanorod (AuNR) is an excellent photothermal agent owing to their adjustable longitudinal surface plasmon resonance and high light-to-heat conversion efficiency. 71,72 These rod-shaped NPs allow prolonged blood circulation time and facilitate deeper mammary tumors penetration than nanospheres with the same diameter. 40,71 Dendrimers are inherent polymeric scaffolds for encapsulation of small inorganic NPs (2-20 nm) used to further increase blood circulation time, solubility and dimensional stability of nanohybrids. 73 A smart nanohybrid, termed Au nanorod/dendrimer-assembly nanohybrids (AuNR@Da NHs), with size of about 130 nm, has been constructed by supramolecular encapsulation of 83.0 w/w% AuNR into dendrimer assemblies. 73 The amphiphilic dendrimer assemblies are composed of PEGylated and antitumor adriamycin (ADR)-decorated dendrons, containing tumor microenvironmental matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-cleavable linkages, intracellular GSHdegradable disulfide bonds and pH-breakable hydrazone bonds that are highly responsive towards tumor microenvironment. Li et al. (2018) 73 investigated the biological adapting ability of the nanohybrids under different biomimetic stimulations. The group proved that AuNR@Da NHs could adapt sequential biological barriers through triple-responsive features: enzyme/redox/pH, to facilitate deep tissue penetration and high internalization in tumors, particularly in human ovarian tumors that are deep within the abdominal cavity and most of the time difficult to palpate. 74 The permeability of nanohybrids in ovarian tumors are further improved, credit to the efficient photothermal properties of AuNRs in AuNR@Da NHs (about 70 %, as compared to single AuNRs about 60 %). The amount of internalized AuNR and ADR mediated by nanohybrids, were about 27-fold and 6.6 times higher, respectively, than individual AuNR-treated. Furthermore, the nanohybrids were capable of generating hyperthermia (up to 67 C), with tumor accumulation of more than 2.3 times higher. NIRinduced hyperthermia subsequently induces the rupture of the lysosome, accelerates the endosomal release of ADR/AuNRs and thus inhibits the human ovarian tumor cells in vivo.Triggering of this charge reversal makes the NPs attach to the surface of cancer cells, leading to targeted accumulation within tumors. 46 Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women and has the fourth highest mortality rate (among cancers in women). 66 Additionally, it is a solid tumor associated with human papillomavirus infection. 66 An example of synergistic PTT and drug delivery for cervical cancer is the use of multi-layered single-walled carbon nanotubes, termed SWNT@BSA@Au-S-PEG-FA@DOX, which was prepared using a facile layer-by-layer assembly process. 67 Carbon nanotubes display hemodynamic properties as its shape greatly affects its circulation time and biodistribution. 68 For example, the needle-like morphology of nanotubes contributes to increased specific area for interaction with plasma proteins and cells; permits cell penetration via both endocytosis and diffusion across the plasma membrane; and allows longer circulation time (up to 10 times longer) in blood, as compared to spherical nanomaterials. 69 Coating of bovine serum albumin (BSA) on oxidized and cutsingle-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) provides abundant active sites for the nucleation of Au seeds, subsequently converting Au into AuNPs by in situ reduction.

        <p>In brief, AuNR@DA NHs with laser irradiation offered strong curative effects, with an inhibition rate of 80.7 %, on synergistic chemo-photothermal treatment for combating multidrug resistance. 73 Overall, targeting and therapeutic efficacy of Au nanostructures can be enhanced by tuning its physiochemical properties such as size, surface chemistry and shape. On the other hand, tumor pathological characteristics also play an important role in penetration of nanomedicines in tumor, as tumor microenvironment is highly heterogeneous between different types of tumors. Hence, characterization of both Au nanostructures and pathological properties of tumors are equally important in the design of nanomedicine with nanotheranostic properties.In brief, AuNR@DA NHs with laser irradiation offered strong curative effects, with an inhibition rate of 80.7 %, on synergistic chemo-photothermal treatment for combating multidrug resistance. 73 Overall, targeting and therapeutic efficacy of Au nanostructures can be enhanced by tuning its physiochemical properties such as size, surface chemistry and shape.

        <p>Inorganic nanomaterials are multifunctional NPs platform synthesized from metals, metal oxides and metal sulfides. Inorganic nanomaterials are relatively stable over large ranges of pH and temperature, 10 resistant to enzymatic or photochemical degradation, 70 thus suitable for nanotheranostics in tumor microenvironment. 70,75 Copper sulfide (CuS) NPs are featured with several properties compared to other commonly used NPs, such as prominent absorbance, effective heat conversion, small particle size, easy modification and facile synthesis. 76 A tumor-targeting nanocomposite (CuS@BSA-MBA-cRGD) with photothermal effect for targeting of liver-intestinal metabolism pathway was synthesized recently. 77 The biocompatibility and stability of CuS NPs were improved via capping effect of BSA. Then, NIR fluorescence probe (MBA) and tumor-targeting ligand cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (cRGD) peptide were further conjugated on the surface of CuS@BSA. Peptides are another commonly used ligand targeting moiety, with advantages in terms of chemical stability, ease of synthesis and reduced immunogenicity. 59 cRGD can target the cell-adhesion molecule, αvβ3 integrin, that is over-expressed on tumor new-blood vessels and some tumor cells. 78 The as-synthesized CuS@BSA-MBA-cRGD served as an infrared thermal imaging contrast agent for infrared thermal imaging and as a photothermal agent for tumor ablation via PTT. However, the obtained nanocomposite has a mean diameter of about 51.2 nm, 77 raising concerns regarding its uptake by reticuloendothelial system (RES) organs that may cause slower elimination from the body and potential toxicity after effective treatment. 79 Generally, most of the nanomaterial-based PDT requires an additional photosensitizer or high-power laser sources for effective therapy.

        <p>The rise in temperature will subsequently lead to cell death rather than ROS generation for PDT. Srivani et al. (2018) 70 proposed copper bismuth sulfide (Cu3BiS3) nanocrystals as an innovative human breast tumor treatment alternative, after showing the potential of Cu3BiS3 inducing PDT without any photosensitizer, at safe laser zone (808 nm, 10 mW/cm 2 , 10 min), and in the deep tissue penetrative NIR region. Bi, with high x-ray attenuation, could serve as an efficient x-ray contrast probe; while Cu ions, with broad NIR absorption, could serve as NIR-responsive PDT and PTT agents. Upregulation of Cu ion leaching upon irradiation coupled with Bi efficiently capturing more photons is believed to contribute to the realization of Cu3BiS3 in exceptional PDT effects at low laser power. 70 Although the group has shown that the as-synthesized Cu3BiS3 nanocrystals are highly biocompatible without any genotoxic effects, yet, the uptake of this 12 nm nanocrystals by RES organs, their in vivo degradation behavior and clearance after PDT still require further investigation.

        <p>A photosensitiser-Pd@Pt nanosystem has been designed for highly efficient PDT in human breast tumors [see Figure 2b (ii)]. 44 Palladium (Pd)-based nanomaterials have good catalaselike activity, which can decompose H2O2 to produce oxygen and water. This subsequently improves the hypoxic environment of solid tumor. 44 However, like other inorganic nanomaterials, Pd has chemically/biologically inert framework, which raises concerns over the low biodegradation and biosafety issues. 10 Functional inorganic 2D biomaterials, MnO2 nanosheets, have been introduced recently for improved theranostic performance [see Figure 2b (iv)]. 80 Preliminary studies demonstrate its biocompatibility as Manganese (Mn) is one of the necessary trace elements in the human body. The ultra-thin MnO2 nanosheets structure, with an average thickness of 2 nm, is highly sensitive towards the endogenous (acidic and reducing) tumor microenvironment. 80 It was found that the MnO2 nanosheets started to disintegrate and release Mn 2+ only within 3 min in acidic (pH 5.0) and reducing ([GSH] = 5.0 mM) solutions, with longitudinal relaxitivity (r1) of 5.45 mM -1 s -1 and 4.81 mM -1 s -1 , respectively. The r1 of MnO2 nanosheets in neutral solution was only 0.87 mM -1 s -1 . High values of r1 coupled with various direct photographic images demonstrated the potential of MnO2 nanosheets structure as the contrast agents for MRI, since the higher accessibility of the released Mn 2+ to water molecules could enhance brightening effect of MRI signal. MnO2 nanosheets also possess high intrinsic photothermal-conversion capability for PTT. Furthermore, surface modification of the MnO2 nanosheets with soybean phospholipid improved the stability of the nanosheets in physiological condition. 80 Mesoporous NiO (mNiO) NPs also appear as a photothermal conversion agent for cancer PTT [see Figure 2b (iii)]. 81 Artemisinin (ART) is a traditional Chinese medicine that is believed to inhibit tumor growth. Attachment of mNiO NPs and terbium complexes bestow mNiO with luminescence imaging features. The mNiO-Tb serves as a MRI contrast agent, a luminescence imaging probe and a vehicle for ART. Synergistic PTT and radical-induced therapy of cervical tumors was achieved using this ART-loaded mNiO nanoplatform. 81 Nonetheless, the selective damage mechanism of ART to cancer cells remains elusive, and the toxicity of ART derivatives to normal cells needs to be explored. Perfluorocarbon (PFC) is a chemically inert molecule with high oxygen-carrying capacity and good biocompatibility for in vivo application. 47 Owing to the intrinsic hydrophobic nature of the PFC compounds, their clinical application usually involves encapsulation by a carrier matrix. Porous hollow magnetic Fe3O4 NPs (PHMNPs) have a large central cavity for the loading of small molecules and/or the therapeutic cargo, while retaining favorable biological properties of conventional iron oxide NPs (intrinsically super-paramagnetic, as a contrast agent for MRI). In view of this, PFC and etoposide (EP) were loaded onto PHMNPs. Oxygen was released at a moderate rate from the PHMNPs over an extended period of time, effectively reducing the hypoxia-induced EP resistance of liver tumor cells and facilitating concurrent chemotherapy. Modification of the surface of PHMNPs with lactobionic acid (LA)-containing amphiphilic polymers (LA-PEG-S-S-C18PMH), through hydrophobic interaction, facilitates selective targeting of LA against the asialoglycoprotein receptor present on the plasma membrane of hepatocytes. 47 Besides, the intracellular agglomeration of the nanocarriers after GSH-triggered removal of the hydrophilic LA-PEG segment could significantly enhance intracellular accumulation and improve therapeutic efficacy. 47 In addition, the upconversion NPs (UCNP)-based theranostic micelles have been proposed for dual-modality imaging and PDT in HCC [see Figure 2b (i)]. 82 Loading of mitoxantrone (MX) and anti-epithelial cell adhesion molecule (anti-EpCAM) onto PEGylated UCNP micelles has improved the biocompatibility and synergistic antitumor efficiency of the system, without any noticeable systemic toxicity. 82 Like other commonly used UCNP-based therapeutic approach, the as-synthesized 23.4 nm UCNPs are difficult to fabricate in ultrasmall (&lt; 15 nm diameter) sizes. The quantum yield of these UCNPs was not reported.A photosensitiser-Pd@Pt nanosystem has been designed for highly efficient PDT in human breast tumors [see Figure 2b (ii)]. 44 Palladium (Pd)-based nanomaterials have good catalaselike activity, which can decompose H2O2 to produce oxygen and water. This subsequently improves the hypoxic environment of solid tumor. 44 However, like other inorganic nanomaterials, Pd has chemically/biologically inert framework, which raises concerns over the low biodegradation and biosafety issues. 10 Functional inorganic 2D biomaterials, MnO2 nanosheets, have been introduced recently for improved theranostic performance [see Figure 2b (iv)]. 80 Preliminary studies demonstrate its biocompatibility as Manganese (Mn) is one of the necessary trace elements in the human body. The ultra-thin MnO2 nanosheets structure, with an average thickness of 2 nm, is highly sensitive towards the endogenous (acidic and reducing) tumor microenvironment. 80 It was found that the MnO2 nanosheets started to disintegrate and release Mn 2+ only within 3 min in acidic (pH 5.0) and reducing ([GSH] = 5.0 mM) solutions, with longitudinal relaxitivity (r1) of 5.45 mM -1 s -1 and 4.81 mM -1 s -1 , respectively. The r1 of MnO2 nanosheets in neutral solution was only 0.87 mM -1 s -1 . High values of r1 coupled with various direct photographic images demonstrated the potential of MnO2 nanosheets structure as the contrast agents for MRI, since the higher accessibility of the released Mn 2+ to water molecules could enhance brightening effect of MRI signal. MnO2 nanosheets also possess high intrinsic photothermal-conversion capability for PTT. Furthermore, surface modification of the MnO2 nanosheets with soybean phospholipid improved the stability of the nanosheets in physiological condition. 80 Mesoporous NiO (mNiO) NPs also appear as a photothermal conversion agent for cancer PTT [see Figure 2b (iii)]. 81 Artemisinin (ART) is a traditional Chinese medicine that is believed to inhibit tumor growth.

Lastly, overall understanding of nanotoxicology of UCNPs (NPs distribution, excretion, metabolism, pharmacokinetics etc.) in animal models is of utmost importance. 83 Quantum dots (QDs) is a luminescent inorganic nanomaterial with rich surface chemistry and optical properties. The application of QDs in biomedical field has been challenged by its nonspecific internalization and toxicity. 84 Shi et al. (2018) 84 covalently coupled folic acid (FA) and 5-fluorouracil acetic acid (FUA) on the surface of QDs, to produce a HCC targeted therapy system, named FA-QDs-FUA. FA is responsible for the specific targeting of the system to the hepatocarcinoma cells; while QDs acts as the delivery vehicles and imaging agent. FUA which interferes with nucleic acid synthesis, has been chosen as the therapeutic agent. PEG has been selected as the linker chain to facilitate attachment of FUA to the QDs' surface and dramatically suppress the non-specific interaction of QDs. The optimal proportion of FA: PEG-QDs: FUA = 10: 1: 100 was used. Noteworthy, the content of FA in the system is controlled within 10 %, since excess FA may promote undesired tumor cell growth. The system was observed to exert reduced toxic side effects and better anti-tumor efficacy. 84 Nevertheless, the particle size of FA-QDs-FUA was about 220.28 nm, which is bigger than 160 nm, raising concerns about the cellular uptake and accumulation of the FA-QDs-FUA at tumor sites. Another similar work has been reported by Ma et al.

The excellent temporal resolution and high tissue penetration depth were achieved by fluorescence imaging, further supporting the potential of QDs as multifunctional contrast agents for multimodal imaging in clinical diagnosis. 85 Magnetic metal oxide nanomaterials (MMONPs) are negative contrast agents for T2-weighted MRI. In response to intratumoral oxidability and acidity, MMONPs degrade and release corresponding metal ions that can serve as highly efficient positive T1-weighted contrast agent. The ratio of increase of T1 signals against decrease of T2 signals (T1/ T2) from MMONPs, is known as ratiometric MRI, which is highly selective for solid tumor imaging. 45 Cobalt oxide nanoprism (Co3O4), a type of MMONPs, has been selected and tuned for selective ratiometric MRI tumor imaging and synergistic cancer theranostics (PTT, chemodynamic and chemotherapy). The as-prepared Co3O4 nanoprism is cuboidal, with a thickness of 3.26 nm and a length of 33.29 nm, instead of triangular structure. This could be due to the presence of high concentration of surfactant used during the synthesis which subsequently inhibited nanomaterial growth in specific spatial directions. 45 It is interesting to note that although the sharp vertices of the triangular nanoprism may lead to stronger nearfield enhancements for plasmonic applications, unfortunately, its high surface energy vertices most likely will make the nanoprism highly unstable and readily degradable. 86 Nevertheless, the Co3O4 nanoprism possess significant photothermal conversion efficiency (= 60.07 %), outstanding MRI contrast (r2= 5.42 mM -1 s -1 ) and good DOX delivery (29.36 mg/g), with a low detection limit (50 nM) and broad linear range (0-50 M). 45 In turn, the cuboidal structure and fast degradation property of the as-prepared Co3O4 nanoprism could contribute to enhanced drug delivery and controllable drug release.Besides, since water has an absorption peak around 980 nm, laser excitation at 980 nm will result in unnecessary tissue heating during PDT.

Moreover, conversion of NIR light (1064 nm) into heat greatly improved tumor oxygenation via increasing the blood flow, overcoming the hypoxia-associated radio-resistance of the tumor. The presence of copper ions is capable of catalyzing the conversion of endogenic H2O2 into highly reactive hydroxyl radicals and increase the level of oxygen radicals, hence further destroy the cancer cells. The as-synthesized NCs also have strong absorption in the second NIR window (1000-1400 nm), allowing a deeper tissue penetration ability, with low scattering and energy absorption by tissues, than in the first NIR window (650-950 nm). 87 High atomic number NPs such as platinum, gold and bismuth are high electron emitters.

        <p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a biomedical imaging modality combining the high contrast of optical imaging with the high spatial resolution of ultrasound imaging. 5,42,45,72 PAI can also be defined as the non-radiative conversion of light energy into sound energy. 17 Based on the use of non-ionizing laser pulses, PAI non-invasively visualizes anatomical structures with greater penetration depth (several cms) and specificity than conventional optical imaging, suitable for imaging superficial tumors at breast and skin. 94 On the other hand, high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a minimally invasive therapeutic modality. HIFU concentrates multiple intersecting beams of ultrasound into the targeted tumor region. Subsequently, it generates hyperthermia and mechanical effects to destroy the affected areas. 95 A multifunctional poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanocapsule, termed Cu2-xS/PFBO@PLGA or in short CPPNs, encapsulating PAI contrast copper sulfide nanodots (Cu2-xS NDs) and a typical HIFU synergistic liquid, perfluorooctyl bromide (PFOB) has been constructed using emulsion solvent evaporation strategy. 95 The high performance of Cu2-xS NDs in the absorption and conversion of NIR confers high PAI contrast capability to the CPPNs, by which the location of the CPPNs within a tumor can be monitored successfully under PAI. Shifting absorption from the first to the second NIR-window could enhance PAI contrast in imaging of deep lying living structures in vivo. 17 Due to the encapsulated PFOB, the cavitation effect in CPPNs is improved, thus enhances the ablation efficacy under HIFU exposure. With a particle size of 123.7 nm, CPPNs show its potential as a theranostic agent for future photoacoustic image-guided HIFU synergistic therapy of breast cancer. 95 However, high level of ultrasound energy (usually more than 100 W/cm 2 ) may cause damages to healthy tissues, especially along the path of ultrasound propagation, hence leading to severe side effects. 96 Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) is a concept originated from the phenomena that a class of fluorogens are non-emissive as free molecules but luminescent as aggregates. 57,97 AIEbased bioprobes are suitable to use in real-time imaging probes, credit to their low background, high sensitivity and resistance to photobleaching. A smart nano delivery system, named STD nano-micelle (STD-NM), with ST and TD peptide functionalization and AIE "switch on" characteristics has been presented for precise theranostics and apoptosis monitoring of colon cancer. 97 Comprising of pH-triggered targeting peptide STP (sequence: SKDEEWHKNNFPLSPG), a caspase-3 responsive peptide linker (sequence: DEVD) and an AIE molecule tetraphenylethylene (TPE), ST could recover the fluorescence of the nanocarrier during apoptosis. Meanwhile, TD, a tumor acidity-activated peptide made up of the cell-penetrating peptides TAT and 2,3-dimethylmaleic anhydride, maintained the "stealth" stability of the nanocarrier in the physiological environment. 97 Upon exposure to tumor microenvironment, STP and TAT were switchably stimulated and activate the peptides to penetrate through the colon cancer cells and subsequently release the anticancer drugs (cisplatinum and DOX) into the tumors. The AIE signal will then be "switched on". Gene analysis by RNA-seq has also been performed, supporting the superior therapeutic effect of anticancer drugs-loaded STD-NM treatment. 97 Generally, poor spatial resolution, shallow tissue penetration and relatively low quantum yield of NIR-emissive polymeric NPs than other common fluorescent imaging probes are some of the concerns for polymeric NPs in theranostics. The interaction between lightinduced charge transfer of polymeric NPs with other biological activities requires further detailed study.Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a biomedical imaging modality combining the high contrast of optical imaging with the high spatial resolution of ultrasound imaging. 5,42,45,72 PAI can also be defined as the non-radiative conversion of light energy into sound energy. 17 Based on the use of non-ionizing laser pulses, PAI non-invasively visualizes anatomical structures with greater penetration depth (several cms) and specificity than conventional optical imaging, suitable for imaging superficial tumors at breast and skin. 94 On the other hand, high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a minimally invasive therapeutic modality. HIFU concentrates multiple intersecting beams of ultrasound into the targeted tumor region. Subsequently, it generates hyperthermia and mechanical effects to destroy the affected areas. 95 A multifunctional poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanocapsule, termed Cu2-xS/PFBO@PLGA or in short CPPNs, encapsulating PAI contrast copper sulfide nanodots (Cu2-xS NDs) and a typical HIFU synergistic liquid, perfluorooctyl bromide (PFOB) has been constructed using emulsion solvent evaporation strategy. 95 The high performance of Cu2-xS NDs in the absorption and conversion of NIR confers high PAI contrast capability to the CPPNs, by which the location of the CPPNs within a tumor can be monitored successfully under PAI.

This structure improves their biocompatibility and stability in biological environment, making them suitable as a carrier system. 98 A multifunctional hypoxia-responsive theranostic liposome co-encapsulating a photosensitizer Ce6, hypoxia-activated prodrug tirapazamine (TPZ) and gene probe miRNA-155 was designed for synergistic PDT-chemotherapy of breast cancer. 99 The liposome was fabricated using an innovative hypoxia-responsive 2-nitroimidazole derivative conjugated PEG amphoteric polymer.

        <p>An ultrasound molecular probe based on lipid NPs has been introduced for precision theranostics at an early stage of HCC [see Figure 3b (i)]. 100 As common lipid NPs lack of specific targeting ability, hyaluronic acid (HA) has been chosen as a ligand to actively target the overexpressed CD44 cell adhesion factor on HCC. Cysteine-flanked cell-penetrating peptide (CPP), CG-TAT-GC, has been selected to improve the delivery of macromolecular substances into the nucleus without causing cytotoxicity. 100 The as-synthesized lipid NPs is known as HA-mediated cell penetrating peptide-modified with 10-hydroxycamptothecinloaded on a phase-transformation lipid NPs (HA/CPPs-10-HCPT-NPs). Upon trigger by lowintensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) sonication, the NPs in tumor tissue and cells undergo acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV) and are transformed into microbubbles. 100 The resultant microbubbles not only able to provide significant contrast enhancement in tumor-site imaging, but also increase permeability of NPs into tumor blood vessels and cell membrane. 96 Since the acoustic intensity of LIFU sonication is usually low, no more than 3.2 W/cm 2 , it is less likely to cause tissue necrosis as compared to HIFU. 96 This fascinating mechanism successfully induces local release of antitumor drug in the cytoplasm and nucleus. 100 However, there are some concerns with this approach. Although the ligand-mediated active targeting has been used to improve the targeting efficiency, it is important to fully understand and avoid the adverse side-effects due to off-target distribution of the CPP and its cargo which might induce mutations, cytotoxicity or initiate immune responses in the host.An ultrasound molecular probe based on lipid NPs has been introduced for precision theranostics at an early stage of HCC [see Figure 3b (i)]. 100 As common lipid NPs lack of specific targeting ability, hyaluronic acid (HA) has been chosen as a ligand to actively target the overexpressed CD44 cell adhesion factor on HCC.

        <p>Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles-loaded solid lipid (SPIONs) is made from iron, one of the most abundant metals present in metabolism. SPIONs have big potential as theranostic agent as they display interesting cellular and in vivo interactions with no dramatic toxicity. 69,102,103 A smart nanovehicle with DOX and SPIONs delivery system, in short DOX/SPIONs-loaded DFSLNs, has been constructed for oral chemo/magnetothermal combination therapy of colon cancer. 98 Despite the system combined both DOX chemotherapy and hyperthermia therapy (generated from SPIONs) with high frequency magnetic field (HFMF), its therapeutic efficacy is still limited by the systemic drug absorption into blood circulation. Thereby, the group innovatively coated folate (FA) and dextran on the surface of the NPs in a sequential layer-by-layer manner. 98 Although the fabrication of SPIONs can be relatively easy and reproducible, biocompatible polymer layer, such as PEG and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), is normally coated on the SPIONs surface to improve their biocompatibility and stealthiness for specific targeting. This is because naked SPIONs tend to sediment and aggregate at physiological conditions, resulting in an increased risk of toxicity. 69 Coating of the polysaccharide dextran shell layer on the NPs surface not only evaded the cellular transport and systemic absorption by at least 2 folds, but also enhanced the particle accumulation at the tumor sites by specific association with dextranase present only in colon. The subsequent enzymatic degradation and removal of dextran coating led to the exposure of the FA residues that further facilitate cellular level targeting and uptake of the system by receptor-mediated endocytosis. The preliminary results demonstrated prominent therapeutic efficacy (a 15-fold decrease in tumor mass of mice than the PBS control) of DOX/SPIONs-loaded DFSLNs for the oral administration, with no apparent systemic side effects or toxicity. 98 The particle size of DOX/SPIONs-loaded DFSLNs is approximately 132 nm. In fact, the optimal size of the nanomaterials designed for colorectal cancer should be between 10-100 nm in order to avoid triggering of immune response and clearance by glomerular filtration in the kidneys. 104 The spherical shape of the nanomaterials would encourage longer circulation time in blood and faster uptake by colorectal cancer cells. 105 In short, the potential side effects arising from the off-target distribution of the molecular or drug-loaded lipid NPs require more studies for validation on the effectiveness of the delivery system.

        <p>GO is able to absorb NIR light that subsequently induces the generation of singlet oxygen and offers deeper tissue penetration depths. 114 However, the relatively hydrophobic nature of graphene makes it difficult to be taken up by cells, which in turn minimize their therapeutic efficacy. Hwang et al. (2016) 110 has therefore suggested to graft a biopolymer of HA and a CD44 receptor-specific polysaccharide, onto the GO surface (see Figure 4a). 110 The as-synthesized 170 nm HA-GO conjugate improved stability and solubility of GO in ionic solutions, without any aggregation. With such an idea, the group has also successfully developed an interesting fluorescence-switchable theranostic platform that is able to sense oncogenic miR-21 using anti-sense miR-21 peptide nucleic acid probes and show therapeutic effect on breast cancer simultaneously. 110 On the other hand, GO/gold nanorods (GO/GNR) theranostic nanohybrids have been synthesized in situ at room temperature for precise tumor computed tomography (CT) imaging and PTT of pancreatic cancer. 115 GO is chosen as the template for the synthesis of GNR due to the presence of many oxygen-containing functional groups which can improve solubility and biocompatibility of the system. 115 Meanwhile, the synthesis method is straightforward, environmental-friendly, highly adaptable for different types of synthesis of GO/NPs and most importantly does not form any aggregates. The GO/GNRs showed photothermal effect in vitro, with good optical morphological stability up to six cycles of 808 nm laser irradiation. 115 Graphene quantum dot (GQD) is a zero-dimensional carbon material with excellent chemical stability, optical and electronic properties, biocompatible and allow easy surface modifications. 116,117 Besides, GQD can produce ROS with significantly high quantum yield (greater than 1.0) for PDT, due to their excellent electron donating and accepting capability. 118 GQD has the property of extremely high intrinsic mobility of charge carriers. 119 The work of loading IR780 iodide (IR780) onto FA-functionalized GQD via π-π stacking interactions has been reported recently. 119 The GQDs-FA contains a large and intact sp 2 domain with carboxyl groups around the edge which exhibits excellent water solubility and suitable for further conjugation (see Figure 4b). 119 IR780 is an effective theranostic agent for simultaneous NIR fluorescence imaging and PTT. Yet, its application is often hampered by its insolubility in different solvents due to the presence of the rigid chlorocyclohexenyl ring in the structure. Interestingly, the water solubility of IR780 (33.19 %) is increased by over 2400-fold when loaded onto the GQDs-FA system, with a high photothermal conversion efficiency (87.9 %). The photostability and tumor-targeting ability were greatly improved too. Most importantly, IR780/GQDs-FA, with a particle size of about 9 nm, is capable of producing sufficient hyperthermia to effectively kill cervical cancer cells and completely eradicate tumors upon 808 nm laser irradiation. 119 For future studies, it would be advantageous if pH-responsive features could be incorporated into this system, so that the therapeutic mechanism will be initiated once exposed to acidic tumor microenvironment.GO is able to absorb NIR light that subsequently induces the generation of singlet oxygen and offers deeper tissue penetration depths. 114 However, the relatively hydrophobic nature of graphene makes it difficult to be taken up by cells, which in turn minimize their therapeutic efficacy.

        <p>Generally, the clinical translation of PDT is often challenged due to the low yield of ROS, poor tissue penetration depth of the photosensitizer and short lifetime of ROS. 57,120 A mitochondrial specific PDT, named UCNP-GQD/TRITC, has been presented with the use of rare-earth doped UCNPs mediated NIR-GQD. 120 UCNPs are a kind of inorganic nanomaterials capable of emitting efficient and sharp visible or UV light when excited at NIR. These features of UCNPs permit high penetration depth in biological tissues with high detection sensitivity. 121 Generation of singlet oxygen by the GQD becomes more prominent after UV light emission from UCNPs (see Figure 4c). 120 The high concentration of singlet oxygen observed in mitochondria is due to intrinsic advantages of GQD as well as the highly efficient energy transfer from UCNPs to GQD. Furthermore, surface modification of UCNP-GQD with mitochondrial-targeting fluorescent probe, tetramethylrhodamine-5-isothiocyanate (TRITC), allows the system to target mitochondria precisely and triggers breast cancer cells apoptosis irreversibly (with an inhibition ratio of more than 75 %). 120 However, toxicity from long-term exposure and high quantum yield of singlet oxygen, surface-dependent therapeutic responses, and biological corrosion resistance (a phenomenon in which metallic ions and particles are released in a complex aqueous environment through electrochemical processes) 122 of the GQD are some of the concerns raised regarding this strategy. Also, since GQD (with a 6 nm diameter) is attached on the surface of UCNPs via amide linkages, it is possible that the resultant UCNP-GQD/TRITC composites would cleave off easily when the system is dispersed in a solvent. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), a natural product from Glycyrrhiza glabra, is another mitochondrion targeting ligand. 123 A biocompatible GAfunctionalized GO has been fabricated and used as a carrier for targeted delivery of DOX into mitochondria. Both in vitro and in vivo studies revealed the activation of the mitochondriamediated apoptosis pathway, suggesting GA-GO@DOX's potential for liver cancer treatment. 123 Zhao et al. (2018) 111 has presented a chitosan/dimethymaleic-modified chitosan (CS/CS-DMMA)-functionalized GO NPs, also known as GON/CS/CS-DMMA. Chitosan (CS), a natural polysaccharide that commonly exists in the hard shells of marine crustaceans, has been actively explored to construct various CS-based nanomaterials because of its biocompatibility, biodegradability and structural variability. 124 This hybrid nanocarrier is pHsensitive and has surface charge-reversible ability, which is due to self-assembly of deprotonated carboxyl of GO NPs and the protonated amine of CS via electrostatic interactions. A chemotherapeutic drug, DOX, was adsorbed onto the GO via π-π stacking interaction between the large π conjugated structures of GO and the aromatic structure of DOX. The outer CS-DMMA polyelectrolyte shell of the nanocarrier is negatively charged which prevented premature release of the co-loaded DOX, when circulating in the blood system. Upon reaching the slightly acidic microenvironment (pH 6.5) of liver cancer, the nanocarrier switches to positive charge, due to detachment of chitosan coating, which reexpose the amino groups of the positively charged CS. Consequently, GON/CS/CS-DMMA was capable of delivering DOX effectively at a controlled release rate. 111 In another study, reduction and functionalization of GO using dopamine formed reduced graphene oxide/polydopamine (RGO-PDA). 109 The formed PDA stabilizes the RGO against agglomeration and fouling effects. It also attenuates the in vivo toxicity of RGO and allows covalent surface modification with desired molecules. Conjugation of BSA (as a drug carrier, capturing agent for 4T1 breast cancer cells) onto the RGO-PDA system further permits a higher loading of MRI contrast agent diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)-Mn(II) complex and anticancer drug (MTX). This multifunctional and biocompatible theranostic hybrid system is electrochemically proved to allow higher sensitivity (by a factor of four) towards breast tumor. 109Generally, the clinical translation of PDT is often challenged due to the low yield of ROS, poor tissue penetration depth of the photosensitizer and short lifetime of ROS. 57,120 A mitochondrial specific PDT, named UCNP-GQD/TRITC, has been presented with the use of rare-earth doped UCNPs mediated NIR-GQD. 120 UCNPs are a kind of inorganic nanomaterials capable of emitting efficient and sharp visible or UV light when excited at NIR. These features of UCNPs permit high penetration depth in biological tissues with high detection sensitivity. 121 Generation of singlet oxygen by the GQD becomes more prominent after UV light emission from UCNPs (see Figure 4c). 120 The high concentration of singlet oxygen observed in mitochondria is due to intrinsic advantages of GQD as well as the highly efficient energy transfer from UCNPs to GQD. Furthermore, surface modification of UCNP-GQD with mitochondrial-targeting fluorescent probe, tetramethylrhodamine-5-isothiocyanate (TRITC), allows the system to target mitochondria precisely and triggers breast cancer cells apoptosis irreversibly (with an inhibition ratio of more than 75 %). 120 However, toxicity from long-term exposure and high quantum yield of singlet oxygen, surface-dependent therapeutic responses, and biological corrosion resistance (a phenomenon in which metallic ions and particles are released in a complex aqueous environment through electrochemical processes) 122 of the GQD are some of the concerns raised regarding this strategy. Also, since GQD (with a 6 nm diameter) is attached on the surface of UCNPs via amide linkages, it is possible that the resultant UCNP-GQD/TRITC composites would cleave off easily when the system is dispersed in a solvent. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), a natural product from Glycyrrhiza glabra, is another mitochondrion targeting ligand. 123 A biocompatible GAfunctionalized GO has been fabricated and used as a carrier for targeted delivery of DOX into mitochondria. Both in vitro and in vivo studies revealed the activation of the mitochondriamediated apoptosis pathway, suggesting GA-GO@DOX's potential for liver cancer treatment. 123 Zhao et al. (2018) 111 has presented a chitosan/dimethymaleic-modified chitosan (CS/CS-DMMA)-functionalized GO NPs, also known as GON/CS/CS-DMMA. Chitosan (CS), a natural polysaccharide that commonly exists in the hard shells of marine crustaceans, has been actively explored to construct various CS-based nanomaterials because of its biocompatibility, biodegradability and structural variability. 124 This hybrid nanocarrier is pHsensitive and has surface charge-reversible ability, which is due to self-assembly of deprotonated carboxyl of GO NPs and the protonated amine of CS via electrostatic interactions. A chemotherapeutic drug, DOX, was adsorbed onto the GO via π-π stacking interaction between the large π conjugated structures of GO and the aromatic structure of DOX. The outer CS-DMMA polyelectrolyte shell of the nanocarrier is negatively charged which prevented premature release of the co-loaded DOX, when circulating in the blood system. Upon reaching the slightly acidic microenvironment (pH 6.5) of liver cancer, the nanocarrier switches to positive charge, due to detachment of chitosan coating, which reexpose the amino groups of the positively charged CS. Consequently, GON/CS/CS-DMMA was capable of delivering DOX effectively at a controlled release rate. 111 In another study, reduction and functionalization of GO using dopamine formed reduced graphene oxide/polydopamine (RGO-PDA). 109 The formed PDA stabilizes the RGO against agglomeration and fouling effects. It also attenuates the in vivo toxicity of RGO and allows covalent surface modification with desired molecules. Conjugation of BSA (as a drug carrier, capturing agent for 4T1 breast cancer cells) onto the RGO-PDA system further permits a higher loading of MRI contrast agent diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)-Mn(II) complex and anticancer drug (MTX). This multifunctional and biocompatible theranostic hybrid system is electrochemically proved to allow higher sensitivity (by a factor of four) towards breast tumor. 109</p>
        <p>Although the nanotheranostic strategies are focused more on the diagnosis and therapy of solid tumors, a considerable increase in their application to liquid tumors has been noted in recent years. However, while it is true that liquid tumors are classified as leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma, only the former two have generated interest in the scientific community. 37 The strategy to carry out nanotheranostics in tumors are selected according to several variables, the most important being the disposition and accessibility of the tumor by the nanomaterials. Liquid tumors are more accessible than solid tumors, since they are present throughout the bloodstream, whereas in solid tumors, the nanostructures must cross tissue barriers to detect and treat. 125 In this section, we will evaluate how and why the specific nanomaterials are selected to carry out nanotheranostic strategies in liquid tumors.Although the nanotheranostic strategies are focused more on the diagnosis and therapy of solid tumors, a considerable increase in their application to liquid tumors has been noted in recent years.

        <p>Metal NPs are presented as an interesting strategy for the detection and therapy of lymphoma and leukemia. Their ability to generate heat from the optical energy allows them to be nanoagents for PTT. However, its application for liquid tumor theranostics have not been fully studied and this is due to the fact that these types of circulating tumors are not located at a certain point and therefore may cause ablation of adjacent tissue. 126 In this context, 100 nmsized iron oxide NPs (IONPs) functionalized with FA have been evaluated as promising platform for imaging followed by therapy of tumors related to the lymphatic system. Coating with FA does not require the use of linkers and therefore prevents the NPs from being oversized and enhances its accessibility to the lymph vessels. Moreover, FA provides stability to the NPs as it provides a negative surface charge, and this increases its retention in vessels.Metal NPs are presented as an interesting strategy for the detection and therapy of lymphoma and leukemia.

        <p>Finally, FA on the IONPs could specifically recognize the folate receptor that is overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells. 127 However, IONPs tend to aggregate when placed in biological suspensions and therefore its heating ability is reduced. In order to exceed this limitation, IONPs have been functionalized with a protective mesoporous silica shell, which gives high heating and relaxivity properties when applied in vivo, while keeping its size below 100 nm. 128 Moreover, it should be noted that unlike other metal NPs, these modified IONPs allow positive MRI contrast by displaying bright region and therefore allows effective visualization of the tumor. However, although this nanoparticle has interesting properties, its effectiveness for magnetic hyperthermia therapy of circulating cancer has yet to be demonstrated. The nanomaterial that has proved to be an excellent nanotheranostic agent for in vivo leukemia treatment is Cu-Au alloy nanostructures, where the higher thermal conductivity of the copper allows excellent heating under laser irradiation once the tumor is visualized by NIR imaging. This nanoplatform was proven to target and destroy cancer cells in mice within five minutes (see Figure 5a). 129 Despite this, issues concerning renal clearance and lymphatic fenestration are hindering the current nanotheranostic strategies for liquid tumor treatment. In this context, it is essential to select nanomaterials with a size range from 20-50 nm, as they have proven to enhance in vivo tumor penetration and inhibition. 130Finally, FA on the IONPs could specifically recognize the folate receptor that is overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells. 127 However, IONPs tend to aggregate when placed in biological suspensions and therefore its heating ability is reduced.

        <p>The lanthanide oxyfluoride NPs appear as an alternative to lipid and polymeric based delivery systems, which have low retention and non-specific cellular uptake, respectively. 131 The excellent photoluminescence property of the lanthanide and the conjugation of the nanoparticle with anti CD33 antibody enable it to be an interesting nanotheranostic agent for myeloid leukemia. These NPs are conjugated with anti CD33 that allows retention and internalization in CD33 + AML cells, which otherwise could not accumulate in the blood vessels and therefore making it effective for diagnosis and therapy. (see Figure 5b). 131 They have shown to be successful antitumor agents both in vivo and ex vivo by acting as a specific delivery vehicle of PMI peptide, which antagonizes the inhibitors of the tumor suppressor protein p53.The lanthanide oxyfluoride NPs appear as an alternative to lipid and polymeric based delivery systems, which have low retention and non-specific cellular uptake, respectively. 131 The excellent photoluminescence property of the lanthanide and the conjugation of the nanoparticle with anti CD33 antibody enable it to be an interesting nanotheranostic agent for myeloid leukemia.

        <p>Polymeric NPs have been applied mostly for image-guided anticancer drug delivery. In this context, several types of polymeric NPs have been used depending on the diagnostic strategy to be followed. For the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, amphiphilic polymers composed of hydrophobic fluorescent curcumin and hydrophilic PEG were designed as selfassembled anti-cancer drug nanovesicles [see Figure 5c (i)]. 132 Limitations associated with the drug, such as low solubility and low bioavailability, was curtailed with PEG. The most attractive aspect of this nanomaterial is the ability of curcumin to act as both a strong fluorescent probe and an anti-cancer drug, avoiding the need of a fluorophore. 133 Furthermore, a multifunctional imaging theranostic approach based on core-shell chitosan-HA NPs has been applied in murine model of B-cell lymphoma. 134 Since they are initially conjugated with fluorophores and then loaded with paramagnetic tracers, the most suitable imaging agent can be chosen depending on the tumor type; fluorescent reflectance imaging for scanning of superficial structures such as sentinel lymph node and MRI for deep tissue visualization. Another advantage is that the HA has numerous active groups that are useful for specific targeting. In this context, these polymeric NPs were decorated with a specific mimotope (pA20-36) that exclusively recognize A20 lymphoma cells and induce cell apoptosis. Moreover, amphiphilic perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives were developed and further self-assembled into a series of PDI NPs with different sizes of 30, 60, 100, and 200 nm. They have been proven to perform activable PAI and effective PTT [see Figure 5c (ii)]. 135Polymeric NPs have been applied mostly for image-guided anticancer drug delivery.

        <p>Lipid NPs have also been applied as carriers for lymphoma theranostics, but as an alternative to improve cell internalization and simultaneous drug delivery. Liposomes that contain SPIONs and functionalized with rituximab antibody has been developed as theranostic agent for central nervous system lymphoma (see Figure 5d). 136 Blood-brain barrier regulates the movement of molecules, ions and cells between the continuous non-fenestrated microvasculature and the central nervous system. 137 The restrictive nature of the blood-brain barrier pose challenges for targeted drug delivery to the central nervous system, and it is usually associated with neurological diseases including neurodegenerative diseases. 138 In this case, free rituximab is not able to cross the blood-brain barrier, hence it requires a drug delivery system to perform effective therapy. The liposome is used as a rituximab vehicle, with sizes of less than 200 nm. Surface modification of liposome with a non-ionic surfactant allows penetration into the blood-brain barrier and therefore can develop its antitumor function. The liposome which also contains SPIONs allows in vivo MRI with both T1 and T2 modes. Nevertheless, the anti-lymphoma activities of the liposome have only been tested in vitro and therefore this strategy only remains as a promising tool for clinical translation. 136Lipid NPs have also been applied as carriers for lymphoma theranostics, but as an alternative to improve cell internalization and simultaneous drug delivery.

        <p>Neurodegenerative diseases are a set of heterogeneous disorders that result in a progressive loss of certain neuronal systems and finally loss of cognitive abilities. Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Huntington's disease are the prototypes of degenerative diseases. 139 Among them, AD is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, and this is the reason that most of the nanotheranostic strategies applied on brain diseases are focused on this specific disorder. While it is true that the causative mechanism of the disease is unknown, there are several hypotheses that consider the deregulation of metal levels in the brain is associated with multiple pathological factors of the disease, such as amyloid aggregation and oxidative stress. In this context, the nanotheranostic platforms are classified according to the therapeutic strategy to be performed, which is usually the amyloid-β aggregation inhibition and metal chelation. 140Neurodegenerative diseases are a set of heterogeneous disorders that result in a progressive loss of certain neuronal systems and finally loss of cognitive abilities.

        <p>The application of nanotheranostics to AD is a clear example of how nanoplatform is designed according to the type of therapy to be performed. Unlike nanotheranostics for cancer disease, in which the therapy is usually tumor thermal ablation or specific drug delivery, for AD the therapy is usually based on the inhibition of the Aβ aggregation, since these have a direct relationship with the disease's poor prognosis. In this context, three NIR dyes (DMA-SLOH, DBA-SLOH, and DPA-SLM) for in vivo imaging of Aβ species and inhibition of Aβ aggregation have been developed (see Figure 6a). 141 The advantage of using fluorescence imaging is that the use of high cost and low sensitivity MRI and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging (in which radioactive compounds and use of sophisticated instruments) are completely avoided. Moreover, the use of NIR fluorescence reduces the interference caused by native fluorescence biological compounds, which have wavelength emission peak below 550 nm. Furthermore, the NIR dyes are proven to have excellent blood-brain barrier permeability, good biostability and renal clearance ability. 141 However, since the strategies of nanotheranostics reported for inhibiting the aggregation of βamyloids have shown to fail in clinical trials, a multifunctional nanocomposite has been developed for the specific targeting of Tau and its aggregation inhibition. Tau aggregation is an independent amyloid-β AD pathology that leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and consequently oxidative stress generation and cognitive deficit. The nanocomposite consists of a mesoporous silica nanoparticle that acts as a carrier of ceria and iron oxide nanocrystals, for antioxidant function and MRI probe, respectively (see Figure 6b). 142 The Tau aggregation inhibition is due to the loading of the carrier with methylene blue. This nanomaterial proved to be an effective in vivo theranostic agent due to its retention capability in the axon and its synergic therapeutic effect on AD. Despite this, in order to promote clinical translation of this nanoplatform, the nanocomposite must fulfill the Lipinski's rules, which determine its capability to cross the blood-brain barrier. 143The application of nanotheranostics to AD is a clear example of how nanoplatform is designed according to the type of therapy to be performed.

        <p>The process of Aβ aggregation is promoted by the increase in the concentration of trace metal ions, such as Cu 2+ ; therefore, determining its concentration in the brain is an essential tool for diagnosis of AD. In this context, fluorescence chelators, BTTA composed of a cyclen group and a benzothiazole aniline group (BTA) has been developed, in which BTA allows specific fluorescence imaging of Aβ species and the cyclen group acts as an attenuator of the metal induced Aβ aggregation (see Figure 6c). 144 This nanotheranostic agent satisfies the restrictive terms of Lipinski's rules and has demonstrated its functionality in vitro and its ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier in vivo. However, it should be noted that it requires structural modifications for longer fluorescence emissions or even NIR emission with acceptable penetration depth. 144 For this reason, UCNPs modified with complex 8hydroxyquinoline-2-carboxylic acid (HQC) have been developed. The fluorescence emission of the UCNPs is quenched when Cu 2+ is detected, due to luminescence resonance energy transfer. As the Cu 2+ is captured by HQC, it inhibits the aggregation of Aβ and subsequently eliminates the toxic Aβ intermediates (see Figure 6d). 145 Although this nanomaterial was reported as a promising nanotheranostic agent in human brain, it is noteworthy that the in vivo experiment was performed on zebrafish, which has a transparent brain compared to a complex human brain. In order to determine the efficacy of this nanotheranostic agent for AD patients, further in vivo assays should be conducted.The process of Aβ aggregation is promoted by the increase in the concentration of trace metal ions, such as Cu 2+ ; therefore, determining its concentration in the brain is an essential tool for diagnosis of AD.

        <p>There are more than 80 types of autoimmune diseases; with the classic symptom of inflammation. Current clinical treatment modalities are generally non-specific and focus on reduction of inflammation. Moreover, the use of anti-inflammatory drugs lack of desired specificity, has severe toxic effects and limited therapeutic benefits. 146 NPs can be used as a drug delivery system to specifically target cells and tissues. Co-delivery of targeting and therapeutic agents using NPs can greatly improve pharmacokinetics and enhance bioavailability of therapeutics. NPs used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases can be classified as colloidal NPs (consist of a metal core stabilized by an organic/polymeric coating) and organic-based NPs (either polymeric or lipid-based). 147 The biodegradability, biocompatibility, biodistribution and clearance of NPs are very important issues to take into consideration when constructing an efficient NPs-based nanomedicine for autoimmune disease theranostics.There are more than 80 types of autoimmune diseases; with the classic symptom of inflammation.

        <p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease, characterized by severe cartilage, bone destruction and massive synovial joint inflammation. Currently, there is no cure for RA. 148 The integration of targeting and therapeutic agents in RA into a single nanomaterial-based theranostic platform is increasingly advancing in rheumatology. This section will present few nanomaterials that have been discovered lately, with the potential for synergistic RA theranostics. Activated macrophages are the main "culprit" of inflammation in RA. The macrophages actively release cytokines which trigger onset and persistence of RA. Dextran sulfate (DS) is a hydrophilic polysaccharide that can specifically target the scavenger receptor (SR, one of the receptors overexpressed on the macrophages). MTX is achemotherapy drug that is commonly used for the treatment of RA. However, the utility of MTX is limited by its severe drug resistance, random distribution in the body which may cause serious side effects.Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease, characterized by severe cartilage, bone destruction and massive synovial joint inflammation.

        <p>Combining both the benefits of nanoscale prodrugs and modified conjugates, a biocompatible polymer-drug conjugate, namely dextran sulfate-graft-methotrexate conjugate (DS-g-MTX), has been designed for treatment of RA (see Figure 7a). 149 The conjugate (about 100 nm in diameter) exhibited excellent SR targeting properties, with improved anti-inflammatory efficiency in the affected joints of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice. 149 Similar work has also been presented by Heo et al. (2017) 150 using MTX-loaded DS NPs (220 nm in diameter), with the loading efficiency of 73 % (see Figure 7b). 150 NPs permit prolonged circulation in the bloodstream, passive accumulation of drugs into inflamed synovial tissues (12-fold higher than control), with controlled drug release at desired action sites. The results further confirmed that polymeric NPs are potentially useful theranostic nanomedicine for RA. 150 Solid lipid NPs (SLNs) are formed by a mixture of solid lipids dispersed in inner cores.

        <p>Encapsulation of glucocorticoid prednisolone (PD) can be carried out within the SLNs conjugated with HA and the resultant product is known as HA-SLNs/PD, with approximately 147.8 nm in diameter. Encapsulation of PD in HA-SLNs improved colloidal stability, slowed down PD release (37.6 % compared to 56.22% from free drug solution during the first 30 hours), enhanced biodistribution and therapeutic efficacy in CIA model (with a histopathology score of 2.0). 152 Metallic NPs have been successfully translated to RA treatment due to their size and magnetic properties which can serve as a multifunctional drug delivery and theranostic platform. 148 In a study, researchers designed drug-loaded gold/iron/gold plasmonic NPs for simultaneous magnetic targeted chemo-photothermal treatment and dual (NIR absorbance and magnetic resonance) imaging of RA. 153 The NPs combine the properties of both iron (magnetic) and gold (surface plasmon resonance), and the gold exterior shell provides an anchorage site for further functionalization.

        <p>PLGA is selected due to its excellent biodegradability, biocompatibility and stability. 154 This RGD-conjugated MTX-loaded PLGA Au/Fe/Au half-shell NPs has an average diameter of 135 nm. Upon NIR irradiation, NIR resonance of the Au half-shells generates heat at the inflammation sites to accelerate the release of MTX from PLGA NPs. Besides, the Fe halfshell layer embedded between the Au half-shell layers allows in vivo T2-MRI and NIR absorbance imaging [(see Figure 7d). 153 The externally generated magnetic field not only speeds up the delivery of the NPs to the inflammation sites, but also enhances the retention of the NPs. The combination of NIR absorbance imaging and MRI allow higher spatial resolution of inflammation regions with outstanding contrast features, higher sensitivity and specificity. Interestingly, the MTX dosages required in this case is only 0.05% as compared to free MTX therapy for the treatment of RA. 153 The in vivo behavior (such as biodistribution and vascular penetration) of the as-synthesized NPs requires in-depth studies before wide clinical application.PLGA is selected due to its excellent biodegradability, biocompatibility and stability. 154 This RGD-conjugated MTX-loaded PLGA Au/Fe/Au half-shell NPs has an average diameter of 135 nm.

        <p>A combined strategy PSDT (PDT followed by sonodynamic therapy), using PLGA phasetransition NPs co-loaded with oxygen and indocyanine green (ICG), termed OI-NPs, has been proposed for theranostic of RA by Tang et al. (2017). 154 PSDT may reduce the sensitizer dosage and ultrasound/light energy that can alleviate side effects, while improving the curative effect dramatically. ICG can strongly absorb NIR once activated by light and ultrasound, suitable for therapy or imaging. The stability of the ICG is improved when coloaded with oxygen onto PLGA phase-transition NPs. The synergistic oxygen and ICG are found to act as a sensitizer and oxygen carrier for PSDT. The prepared NPs have advantages in terms of biosafety and stability, at the same time showing cytotoxic effects on synoviocytes (a specialized cell type located inside the joints, responsible in producing cytokines and proteases, which cause cartilage destruction). 154 Nonetheless, the authors did not report on the performance of the as-synthesized NPs in in vivo model and its therapeutic effect in hypoxic environment. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has shown potential in PDT for some diseases, mainly because of its excellent biocompatibility, easy availability and ROS generation properties upon excitation.A combined strategy PSDT (PDT followed by sonodynamic therapy), using PLGA phasetransition NPs co-loaded with oxygen and indocyanine green (ICG), termed OI-NPs, has been proposed for theranostic of RA by Tang et al.

        <p>Tetra sulfonatophenyl porphyrin (TSPP) is a porphyrin derivative that can generate ROS for PDT, but its application is often hampered by neurotoxicity, phototoxicity and non-specific accumulation in body tissues. Interestingly, the photo-activated TSPP-TiO2 nanocomposites were found to be able to ameliorate RA by PDT in CIA models, when coupled with allogenic bone marrow stem cells (BMSC). 155 Meanwhile, Cu is an essential element in the human body, useful in promoting osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. Cu-based nanomaterials were reported as excellent PTT agents and photosensitizers for PDT. An approach using Cu-based nanomaterials in RA treatment has been proposed with good biocompatibility and facile synthesis (see Figure 7c). 156 Upon NIR irradiation at 808 nm, the as-synthesized L-cysteine (Cys) assisted CuS NPs (named Cu7.2S4 NPs) not only showed better bone preservation, but also displayed outstanding antibacterial ability during intra-articular injection. Hence, the Cu7.2S4 NPs could serve as a synergistic PDT and PTT modality for RA. 156 Drug delivery systems can be manipulated in a way that the nanomaterials only release the drug from the conjugate in response to certain conditions. This is important in avoiding systemic distribution of drugs in the body that necessitates the use of sustained high-dose therapy and may give rise to adverse effects. As such, Li et al. (2017) presented pH-sensitive polymeric micelles for targeted drug delivery to inflamed joints. 157 The polymeric micelles (with particle size of 45.76 nm) are stable in the bloodstream, until it reaches the inflammation sites. An imbalance between increased metabolism and insufficient oxygen supply contributes to low pH in the inflamed synovial fluid (as low as pH 6.0, in some cases even lower than 5.0). 158 Recognition of acidosis of synovial fluid triggers hydrolysis of hydrazone bonds, subsequently releasing the drug, PD in affected joint areas. Same process has also been reported for targeted drug delivery to the acidic microenvironment of solid tumors. The results demonstrated improved therapeutics efficacy, with the therapeutic benefits from each injection lasting for 48-72 hours in preclinical models, 159 fulfilling the needs of sustained prodrug activation kinetics for RA treatment. The as-prepared polymeric micelles inevitably display minimal toxicity, which could be due to micelle uptake by phagocytic cells in liver and spleen that initiates inflammatory responses. 157 Key mechanistic details that induce potential toxicity and inflammatory effects, long-term nanomaterial fates in clearance organs as well as macrophage-nanomaterial interactions are generally unexplored. 160 Future research can be anticipated on fabrication of micelles with bone regeneration capabilities in eroded joints.Tetra sulfonatophenyl porphyrin (TSPP) is a porphyrin derivative that can generate ROS for PDT, but its application is often hampered by neurotoxicity, phototoxicity and non-specific accumulation in body tissues.

        <p>Generally, the RA severity often fluctuates over time. Usually, the treatment offered, doses of drug applied and its release rates are irrespective of disease stage, resulting in non-optimal therapeutic efficacy with potential side effects. Herein, a drug-loaded hydrogel that responds to RA flare-ups in real time has been innovatively introduced. 159 A hydrogel is a threedimensional polymer network of hydrophilic monomers that can absorb and retain a large amount of water, without affecting its shape. Since it can mimic a native tissue's architecture and functions, hydrogel often has been used as drug-delivery carriers. 161 In this case, a hydrogel is formed from the self-assembly of triglycerol monostearate (TG-18), encapsulated with drug triamcinolone acetonide (TA). 159 Synovial fluid from RA joints has higher expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and other tissue-degrading enzymes than synovial fluid from healthy joints. 159 Therefore, upon exposure to synovial fluids from patients with RA, MMPs cleave the ester bond in TG-18, disassemble the hydrogel and release the encapsulated TA on-demand, which exclusively corresponds to the concentration of MMPs expressed in the synovial fluids. The severity of the RA is reflected by the coloaded fluorescent dye 1,1-dioctadecyl-3,3,3,3-tetramethylindotricarbocyanine iodide (DiR). 159 Metalloproteinases-3 (MMPs-3) gene is one of the biomarkers of RA and often correlated with systemic inflammation. Although the precise role of MMPs-3 in RA progression requires further elucidation, TA is believed to be able to alter genes expression of MMPs-3. 162 However, the system still requires extensive in vivo biocompatibility evaluation, sustained TA drug release and encapsulation studies especially in large animal models. It is challenging to maintain a consistent release profile in the setting of constant physiochemical changes.Generally, the RA severity often fluctuates over time.

        <p>Atherosclerosis, a systemic disease affecting arteries, is the major pathological cause of CVDs. Atherosclerosis is characterized by the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, which are developed through the accumulation of cholesterol and formation of foam cells in the arterial wall. 164 Atherosclerotic plaques tend to induce hardening of the artery and thus obstruct blood circulation. 165 Report for non-invasive fluorescence imaging of atherosclerosis in live atherosclerotic mice has been published in 2016, with the use of Simian virus 40 virus-like particles (SV40 VLPs) as a platform to load imaging probes, targeting elements and therapeutic compounds (see Figure 8a). 166 Controllable in vitro self-assembly and the capacity as the cargo for foreign peptides or proteins, makes SV40 VLPs stand out as a nanomaterial in various nanotheranostic applications. 167 Encapsulation of NIR QDs (QD 800) inside SV40 VLPs improved QDs photostability, brightness and detection sensitivity during fluorescence imaging of atherosclerotic plaques in mice. 166 In fact, different atherosclerosis biomarkers or targeting peptides are present at various developmental stages of atherosclerosis. 168 Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), macrophages and fibrin have been identified and used to target atherosclerosis at early, development and late stage, respectively. The multifunctional QDs, with a diameter of 26 nm, permits its accumulation inside the atherosclerotic plaque tissues mediated by EPR effect, in response to the inflammatory process in the vascular. Enhanced targeted delivery of anticoagulant drug Hirulog (about 6.5fold increase) and higher anti-thrombin activity (1.8 µg/mg of tissue) at atherosclerotic plaques has been reported when QDs are functionalized with VCAM-1 targeting peptide. 166 However, the group did not provide strong justification on the atherosclerosis efficacy of these NPs, such as reduced areas of plaques, counts of infiltrated immune cells or the expression of inflammatory markers. 169 Future studies should be focused on more detailed biocompatibility evaluation of the SV40 VLPs, including blood-half life, immunogenicity and comparisons with other protein cages to justify its potential as theranostic tools for atherosclerosis.Atherosclerosis, a systemic disease affecting arteries, is the major pathological cause of CVDs.

        <p>H2O2 is a highly promising theranostic biomarker in various pathological disorders, however, its fluorescence imaging modalities are hindered by its short tissue penetration depth. ICG is a widely used photoacoustic contrast agent with a high signal to noise ratio and maximum emission at around 800 nm. Yet, its application is often challenged by instability, rapid blood clearance and non-targeting ability. 170 Jung et al. (2018) loaded ICG onto boronated maltodextrin (BM) NPs to form spherical ICG-BM NPs with a diameter of 500 nm. 170 Maltodextrin, one of the polysaccharides obtained from partial hydrolysis of starch, is water soluble, biocompatible, biodegradable, versatile and easy to modify. Hence, maltodextrin is suitable to be used as a diluent, coating material and carrier of diagnostic or therapeutic agents in drug delivery system. Substitution of hydroxyl groups of maltodextrin with boronic ester forms BM, rendering maltodextrin with H2O2-responsive properties. ICG-BM NPs react with H2O2 to generate echogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) bubbles which significantly enhanced fluorescence (almost 2-fold higher); ultrasound (signal detectable even with low-frequency ultrasound transducer); and photoacoustic signals in H2O2-triggered manner. Moreover, ICG-BM NPs could exert therapeutic effects by scavenging the overexpressed H2O2 and simultaneously release therapeutic 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (HBA). HBA displays antiinflammatory, antioxidant and antiplatelet functions by suppressing the expression of proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and soluble CD 40 ligand in activated platelets, 171 thus relieving inflammation and accelerating angiogenesis. 170 Future work can be anticipated on reducing the size of ICG-BM, since NPs with sizes over 100 nm are easily recognized by macrophages and accumulate in lymph nodes, liver, spleen as well as lungs. 59 High density lipoproteins (HDL) are responsible for reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), a process to efflux excess cholesterol in the periphery back to the liver. RCT is important in protecting against CVDs. A magnetic nanostructure (MNs) functionalized with phospholipids and apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1), named HDL-MNs, has been developed to mimic the natural HDL particles present in the body (see Figure 8b). 172 The MNs are biocompatible and composed of Fe3O4 NPs, suitable to be used as contrast agents for MRI. The use of HDL-MNs for CVDs is a non-invasive imaging and therapeutic approach. Apart from being capable of precise targeting of macrophages, HDL-MNs are able to perform RCT by inducing cholesterol efflux (about 4.8 %, in natural HDL is about 4.7 %) from cholesterol-rich macrophages. The HDL-MNs have also shown 5 times higher MR contrast enhancement than commercial FDA approved T2 MRI contrast agent (Ferumoxytol). The HDL-MNs are found not inducing cytotoxicity in in vitro setting, in macrophages of up to 350 µM HDL-MNs. 172 The hydrodynamic diameter of the nanostructure, however, is approximately 80-100 nm, which is too big for EPR-based extravasation and may impact its circulation time in blood and accumulation at atherosclerotic plaques. It is of interest to further investigate the targeting ability of this nanostructure in in vivo setting. In addition, the use of iron-based NPs could potentially generate harmful radicals (Fenton reaction). This may limit their use in humans for diagnosis and treatment, especially under oxidative stress-related conditions.H2O2 is a highly promising theranostic biomarker in various pathological disorders, however, its fluorescence imaging modalities are hindered by its short tissue penetration depth.

        <p>Unlike the optical absorption in gold nanostructures, which is due to the surface plasmon resonance, NIR absorption of CuS NPs derives from the d-d transition of Cu 2+ ions. In other words, CuS NPs absorption would less likely be influenced by the solvent or the surrounding factors, which is perfect for in vivo setting. CuS NPs also possess almost analogous high heat conversion efficiencies (as high as 80 %) compared to gold nanostructures, making them remain stable under prolonged optical excitation. 173 Coupling of CuS NPs to antibodies targeting TRPV1 acts as a photothermal switch for TRPV1 signaling in vascular smooth muscles. Upon irradiation of CuS NPs by continuous wave laser at 980 nm, 5 W/cm 2 for 350 s, the NPs (with particle size of 13 nm) generate local heat and strong photoacoustic signal which subsequently opens TRPV1 channels and causes calcium ions (Ca 2+ ) influx. The increase in intracellular Ca 2+ induces autophagy, reduces lipid accumulation and foam cell formation.

        <p>The vulnerable plaques located in the arterial wall are prone to rupture due to soft and weak fibrous cap. The rupture exposes collagen and various components to the blood, leading to the formation of blood clots (thrombi (plural); thrombus (singular)) in the lumen. This condition is known as arterial thrombosis. 164 Thrombosis rarely show any symptoms until late stage and sudden death. 174 Generally, a thrombus is made up of blood factors, mainly activated platelets and water-insoluble fibrin.

Future studies could, therefore, focus on theranostic capabilities, safety and efficacy of fucoidan-MBs, as well as the possibility of incorporation of antithrombotic drugs into the system.</p>

        <p>Upregulation of H2O2 may bring harmful oxidative damage, leading to apoptosis and tissue damage. 161 Inspired by these phenomena, fibrin-targeted imaging and anti-thrombotic nanomedicine (FTIAN) has been constructed for thrombosis theranostic (see Figure 9a). 165 With a diameter of 160 nm, FTIAN has been prepared from self-assembly of IR820 NIR fluorescent dye-conjugated boronate antioxidant polymers (fBAP) and lipopeptides (lipid-PEG-CREKA) composed of 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DSPE), PEG, and a pentapeptide, CREKA (Cys-Arg-Glu-Lys-Ala). High level of H2O2 in thrombus oxidizes boronate in FTIAN and stimulates subsequent release of HBA from fBAP, 165 initiating antioxidant and anti-inflammation activities. 171 On the other hand, high affinity of CREKA in the lipopeptide towards fibrin facilitates the specific targeting of fibrin on the obstructive thrombus using FTIAN. With the use of IR820 as an NIR fluorophore and photoabsorber, the fluorescence/photoacoustic imaging of thrombi has also significantly enhanced by 5-fold. Most importantly, the intrinsic anti-thrombotic activity of FTIAN has suppressed thrombus formation (required a dose of 24 µg/kg of tirofiban only as compared to a clinically used dose of 80 µg/kg). 165 Another thrombus-specific theranostic (T-FBM) NPs have been developed with a mean diameter of 260 nm (see Figure 9b). 171 T-FBM NPs is composed of lipopeptide, GPRPPC-PEG-DSPE (distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine). The pentapeptide, GPRPPC, is used to target the thrombus since it has high affinity to fibrin as well. PEG (3.4 k) serves as a surface corona which may prevent non-specific interaction of T-FBM NPs with plasma proteins. The ultrasound/photoacoustic contrast of T-FBM NPs has been significantly enhanced (by 5-fold) when triggered with H2O2. This is because H2O2 generate CO2 bubbles to amplify the photoacoustic signal. These NPs are also suitable to be used as an antithrombotic nanomedicine, since the NPs can release anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory HBA under oxidative stress-related conditions. Based on the findings, there is an obvious suppression of the thrombus formation in the studied mouse models. However, for most of the works described in this section, the researchers did not report the dose, pharmacokinetics, side effects and toxicology of the NPs used. In fact, the biocompatibility and biodegradability of the NPs are equally important in future clinical applications. Also, unlike non-motile solid tumor, thrombi ultrasound imaging analysis is often challenged by poor contrast resulting from the interference of motion artifact caused by respiratory and cardiac activities.

        <p>The work on both in vitro and in vivo multi-modal mapping and targeted PTT against bacterial infection of gastrointestinal tract was introduced in 2015, with the use of tungstenbased theranostic agents. 175 Since then, different nanoprobes capable of selectively imaging bacteria with high anti-microbial properties have been proposed. Selenium (Se) is a semimetallic element with low electronegativity and large atomic radius compared with sulfur, endowing Se-containing compounds with high reactivity and sensitivity. 176 Moreover, the stimulus-responsive property of Se gives the materials a big potential in construction of smart and sensitive theranostic systems responding to biomolecules. 176 Ruthenium (Ru) is a rare metal in the earth's crust with diverse biomedical and antimicrobial applications, especially in its complex form. 177 For instance, Ru complexes have been found to display synergistic antimicrobial activity with antibacterial peptide UBI29-41 (PEP)-modified Se particles (see Figure 10d). 178 This multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform, or known as Se@PEP-Ru NPs, displayed good biocompatibility, excellent selectivity and potent antimicrobial activity.The work on both in vitro and in vivo multi-modal mapping and targeted PTT against bacterial infection of gastrointestinal tract was introduced in 2015, with the use of tungstenbased theranostic agents. 175 Since then, different nanoprobes capable of selectively imaging bacteria with high anti-microbial properties have been proposed.

        <p>The NPs strongly interact with both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria cell membranes, followed by severely damaging the structures of the bacterial cell and cytoplasmic membranes. The wound sizes of the mice treated with Se@PEP-Ru NPs were found to decrease by about 40% at the fourth day after surgery, showing a significant therapeutic effect. Besides, since Se@PEP-Ru NPs are sensitive to sites of bacterial infection, it was found to be able to identify and distinguish bacterial infection from inflammation and tumor-induced tissue infection with high specificity. 178 Evident fluorescence can be observed (after 4-48 hours of injection) at the site of the bacterial infection but the fluorescence was almost negligible (2-3 times weaker) at the site of inflammation. Future studies can be focused on engineering the as-synthesized Se@PEP-Ru NPs (with a size of about 78 nm) into a smaller size as the size and surface area of NPs could affect the antibacterial activity. 179 Smaller NPs (less than 10 nm) are generally more effective since it allows favorable surface area of NPs for interaction with the bacterial cell membrane and disruption of bacterial permeability and respiration. 180 Metabolic biomolecular labelling is an emerging technology to modify the surface of cells and pathogen with chemical functional groups, which in turn allows conjugation of fluorescent dyes (for imaging purpose) or drugs (for therapeutic effect) onto cell membrane. 181 Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) can be engineered as drug nanocarriers, thanks to their versatile chemical properties, good biocompatibility, sensitive to low pH tumor environment and fast body clearance after drug delivery. A bacteria theranostic strategy through coupling of MOFs with metabolic labelling technique has been reported recently (see Figure 10a). 181 Luminescent porous silicon (LuPSi) has tunable porosity and surface chemistry, good biocompatibility and degradability, making them suitable as optical biosensors for bioimaging and drug delivery. LuPSi can be loaded with antibiotics ciprofloxacin (CIP) to form CIP-LuPSi for theranostic application. 182 For wound care application, a smart bandage composed of polyurethane (PU) membrane and chitosan film, has been presented by Chen et al. (2017) for monitoring and inhibition of wound infection. 182 High level of ROS and elevated pH (above 7.4, normal skin pH= 5.5-6) are two main biomarkers in chronic or infected wounds. 182 The luminescent property of LuPSi is correlated with its surface chemistry. The blue luminescence of CIP was quenched by red LuPSi due to the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) effect. When the smart bandage is applied onto the infected wound that usually associated with an elevated level of ROS and alkaline ions (such as PO4 3-or OH -), the surface of LuPSi was oxidized into an insulating oxide layer that blocked the energy transfer between LuPSi and CIP. As a result, the fluorescence of CIP recovered (from red to blue) and can be observed by naked eyes and a cell phone camera. Therefore, by detecting the ratiometric fluorescence intensity, the kinetic process of surface oxidation of CIP-LuPSi can be precisely measured. The oxidation of LuPSi also simultaneously trigger the release of CIP to inhibit bacterial activity. In the same year, Zhao et al. (2017) developed silica NPs coated with vancomycin-modified polyelectrolyte-cypate complexes (SiO2-Cy-Van), with a size of about 72.7 nm, as a bacteria-activable theranostic nanoprobe (see Figure 10c). 183 The polyelectrolyte acts as an adsorbate or dissociation energy barrier on silica NPs, conferring the NPs with bacteria-responsive feature, as well as enhanced biocompatibility and relatively prolonged blood circulation. The cell wall of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteria is capable of forming hydrogen bonding with vancomycin (Van) on the nanoprobes. The interaction between Van and MRSA detaches the layer-by-layer assembled polyelectrolytes from silica NPs, changing the state of cypate (Cy), a dye with NIR fluorescence emission at around 825 nm, from OFF (aggregation) to ON (disaggregation). This leads to rapid MRSA-activated NIR imaging (4 hours post-injection, high sensitivity up to 10 5 colony-forming units) and effective PTT upon 808 nm laser irradiation. 183 However, the possibility of autofluorescence and influences of bacterial environment on the sensitivity and selectivity of the nanoprobes are not clearly demonstrated. On the other hand, the idea of bacteria-responsive intelligent wound dressing proposed by Zhou et al. (2018) 184 has also offered a different perspective in the fabrication of nanomaterials to combat bacterial infection. The group constructed a biocompatible UVphotocrosslinkable methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) encapsulating both antimicrobials and self-quenching dye carboxyfluorescein vesicles. The working principle is that upon bacterial infection, toxins or enzymatic factors secreted from bacteria could break down the lipid vesicles and release the payloads. This eventually leads to bacterial inhibition in addition to a visual color change (due to the fluorescence recovery of carboxyfluorescein). Supported by both in vitro and in vivo studies, the release of antimicrobials occurs only when pathogenic bacteria (specifically MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) exist. 184 Gold nanomaterials are antibiotic agents owing to their tunable size, facile functionalization and minimal toxicity. It is interesting that recently, gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) have been demonstrated to exhibit anti-bacterial activity, 185 especially by manipulating their surface ligand chemistry. 186 Quaternary ammonium (QA) capped AuNCs (QA-AuNCs), with the size about 2 nm, can selectively target MRSA and Van-resistant Enterococci (VRE), in vivo. 185 Since QA-AuNCs can disrupt the bacterial cell membrane (in terms of integrity, permeability and inner potential), catalyze the generation of ROS and disturb the intracellular metabolic pathway of the bacteria, QA-AuNCs displayed excellent therapeutic effects. The intensely fluorescent QA-AuNCs interact with live/dead bacteria differently, suggesting their potential for image-guided bacteria discrimination and counting. Besides, QA-AuNCs are stable for long-term storage, even at room temperature. 185 On the other hand, it should be noted that it is difficult to compare the anti-bacterial performances of different nanomaterials, since the composite design and concentration of each multifunctional nanomaterial used can be very different, unless more comparable studies are conducted under standard experiment conditions.The NPs strongly interact with both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria cell membranes, followed by severely damaging the structures of the bacterial cell and cytoplasmic membranes.

        <p>for thermal ablation of tumors. 191,192 However, to the best of our knowledge, AuNPs has advanced to only Phase I clinical trials due to the limitation in penetration depth of laser light during PTT and their application in vivo. 17,201,202 The use of a fibre optic NIR laser for deeper laser penetration into tumors or a synergistic PTT and other therapies (or surgery) are some of the possible alternatives to the use of nanomaterials for PTT. 17 Another addition to clinical trials is the Cornell or C dots which are inorganic protein-coatedfluorescent-silica NPs with potential in theranostics of melanoma. 203 C dots allow real-time pre-operative and intraoperative sentinel lymph node (SLN) tissue localization and retention using a hand-held fluorescent camera. 79 Although complete lymph node dissection for patients who had SLN biopsy was deemed inappropriate as a form of treatment after 2017, 113 the C dots are still believed to possess therapeutic effects by reduction in size of tumor and are currently under further investigation. 203 Phase III trials of both concurrent triplet combination therapy (vemurafenib, cobimetinib, atezolizumab) and sequential combination therapy (vemurafenib and cobimetinib alone) in advanced melanoma patients are ongoing. 204 The results of the trials would allow better understanding of the safety and efficacy of targeted therapy and immunotherapy combinations.for thermal ablation of tumors. 191,192 However, to the best of our knowledge, AuNPs has advanced to only Phase I clinical trials due to the limitation in penetration depth of laser light during PTT and their application in vivo. 17,201,202 The use of a fibre optic NIR laser for deeper laser penetration into tumors or a synergistic PTT and other therapies (or surgery) are some of the possible alternatives to the use of nanomaterials for PTT. 17 Another addition to clinical trials is the Cornell or C dots which are inorganic protein-coatedfluorescent-silica NPs with potential in theranostics of melanoma. 203 C dots allow real-time pre-operative and intraoperative sentinel lymph node (SLN) tissue localization and retention using a hand-held fluorescent camera. 79 Although complete lymph node dissection for patients who had SLN biopsy was deemed inappropriate as a form of treatment after 2017, 113 the C dots are still believed to possess therapeutic effects by reduction in size of tumor and are currently under further investigation. 203 Phase III trials of both concurrent triplet combination therapy (vemurafenib, cobimetinib, atezolizumab) and sequential combination therapy (vemurafenib and cobimetinib alone) in advanced melanoma patients are ongoing. 204 The results of the trials would allow better understanding of the safety and efficacy of targeted therapy and immunotherapy combinations.</p>
        <p>Most of the targeted theranostic probes for ovarian cancer are still in various phases of clinical trials, have yet to be approved by the FDA. 205 For the triple-negative breast cancer, only paclitaxel and irinotecan loaded liposomes, also known as EndoTAG-1 and MM-398 have proceeded through clinical studies. 206 There are various clinical trials that have been terminated due to numerous reasons such as inadequate enrolment, variations in the clinical findings and no improvements compared to controls/placebos. For example, CALAA-01, a targeted nanocomplex that contains antiribonucleotide reductase small interfering RNA (siRNA) has been terminated after Phase I.Most of the targeted theranostic probes for ovarian cancer are still in various phases of clinical trials, have yet to be approved by the FDA. 205 For the triple-negative breast cancer, only paclitaxel and irinotecan loaded liposomes, also known as EndoTAG-1 and MM-398 have proceeded through clinical studies. 206 There are various clinical trials that have been terminated due to numerous reasons such as inadequate enrolment, variations in the clinical findings and no improvements compared to controls/placebos.

        <p>Despite showing the potential in solid tumor, the nature and complexity of CALAA-01 raised several concerns (possible immunostimulation, coagulopathic effects, kidney toxicity, offtarget deposition, hepatotoxicity), therefore hindering its clinical translation. 207 One of the flaws in clinical trials is the disconnection between mice and human models. 202 Nanomaterials showing positive theranostic results in in vitro and in vivo settings do not grant their applicability in clinical trials, mainly due to a combination of multiple complex bio-nano interactions in the body. 68,208 Research on nanotheranostic nanomaterials is rapidly advancing to incorporate biocompatibility, specific targeting, advanced imaging and diagnosis, as well as localized drug delivery in the human body. 12,17,23,56,138 An increase in knowledge of physiochemical properties of nanomaterials coupled with the design of multifunctional theranostic platform and microenvironment-priming approaches is likely to radically expedite clinical approval of more nanotheranostic nanomaterials and bring them to clinical applications. Being one of the most interesting and versatile materials, graphene and its derivatives offer a relatively simple but highly integrated and multifunctional nanotheranostic platform for biomedical applications. Nevertheless, more systemic investigations are required to better understand its behavior, biodegradability and toxicological profiles in complex biological environment.Despite showing the potential in solid tumor, the nature and complexity of CALAA-01 raised several concerns (possible immunostimulation, coagulopathic effects, kidney toxicity, offtarget deposition, hepatotoxicity), therefore hindering its clinical translation. 207 One of the flaws in clinical trials is the disconnection between mice and human models. 202 Nanomaterials showing positive theranostic results in in vitro and in vivo settings do not grant their applicability in clinical trials, mainly due to a combination of multiple complex bio-nano interactions in the body. 68,208 Research on nanotheranostic nanomaterials is rapidly advancing to incorporate biocompatibility, specific targeting, advanced imaging and diagnosis, as well as localized drug delivery in the human body. 12,17,23,56,138 An increase in knowledge of physiochemical properties of nanomaterials coupled with the design of multifunctional theranostic platform and microenvironment-priming approaches is likely to radically expedite clinical approval of more nanotheranostic nanomaterials and bring them to clinical applications.

        <p>Concerning nanotheranostic applications in liquid tumors, researches are still in its infancy compared to solid tumor. Most of the approaches done thus far are directed to the diagnosis and treatment of blood cancers, such as lymphoma and leukemia. It is surprising to note that although the physico-chemical scenario of blood cancers is different to solid tumors, the same types of nanomaterials are being used. This can be clearly observed in the use of metal NPs for thermal ablation in both solid and liquid tumors. In solid tumors, the nanomaterial is anchored to the surface of the tumor leading to an effective and non-invasive ablation, whereas in liquid tumor, the target element is in constant circulation and this can lead to ablation of adjacent tissue. The same phenomenon is observed with the use of polymeric and lipid NPs as drug delivery systems in both solid and liquid tumor, where it is not clear the different requirements in terms of blood-brain barrier penetration, stability and renal clearance. This question needs to be solved and more work should be carried out in order to push the nanotheranostics for in vivo applications in circulating tumors.Concerning nanotheranostic applications in liquid tumors, researches are still in its infancy compared to solid tumor.
