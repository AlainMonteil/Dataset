        <p>Liquid-repellent surfaces, such as superhydrophobic surfaces, superoleophobic surfaces, and slippery liquid-infused surfaces, have drawn keen research interest from the communities engaged in chemical synthesis, interfacial chemistry, surface engineering, bionic manufacturing and micro-nano machining. This is due to their great potential applications in liquid-proofing, self-cleaning, chemical resistance, anti-icing, water/oil remediation, biomedicine, etc. However, poor robustness and durability that notably hinders the real-world applications of such surfaces remains their Achilles heel. The past few years have witnessed rapidly increasing publications that address the robustness and durability of liquid-repellent surfaces, and many breakthroughs have been achieved. This review provides an overview of the recent progress made towards robust and durable liquid-repellent surfaces.

        <p>Wetting, referring to the process of making contact between a Liquid And a solid (or liquid) surface, is a ubiquitous phenomenon that exists in our daily life, industry, agriculture, biology, etc., from raindrops on a car windshield to drastic shape transition of living tissues. [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] Wetting shows a range of curious, yet useful behaviors which make the fields concerned with their study intrinsically multidisciplinary, spanning across several areas of chemistry, biology, physics, engineering, etc. Since the introduction of Young's equation in 1805, 9 research on wetting and wettability has continued for over two hundred years. As an important and fascinating subfield of wetting, non-wettable surfaces, which are also termed as liquid-repellent surfaces, have drawn keen yet continuously increasing interests from both academic and industrial communities. [10][11][12][13][14] Upon the discovery of the underlying mechanism (i.e., rough structures and low surface energy) of the self-cleaning and super water repellence of Lotus leaf, 15,16 superhydrophobic surfaces became the earliest research focus for the topic of liquid repellence. Subsequently, the key structural feature (i.e., re-entrant microstructures) of super oil-repellent surfaces was revealed, 17 and the natural oil-repellence of the cuticle of springtail was also discovered, 18 both of which boosted the development of superoleophobic surfaces in air. Later, the fish scale was demonstrated to be super oil-repellent underwater due to its superhydrophilicity in air, 19 which introduced underwater superoleophobicity to the family of super liquid-repellent surface. Moreover, a novel Nepenthes pitcher plant-inspired slippery liquid-/lubricant-infused surface (SLIS) with excellent non-wettable performance (e.g., negligible contact angle hysteresis and low sliding angles) was reported in 2011, 20 which further broadened the research scope of liquid-repellent surfaces. During the last 20 years, much attention has been paid on superhydrophobic surfaces, superoleophobic surfaces (both in air and underwater), and SLISs, and plentiful and significant achievements on these liquid-repellent surfaces have been obtained. As depicted in Fig. 1, when searching the topic of "superhydrophobi*, superoleophobi* or slippery l*-infused surface" in the Web of Science, significant numbers of research articles and reviews could be indexed, which showed a rapid increase most years. Recently, the topic of "superwettability" was selected as one of the 2021 Top Ten Emerging Technologies in Chemistry released by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). 21 Based on the comprehensive and in-depth study of the anti-wetting property of liquid-repellent surfaces, diverse potential applications have been explored and verified especially at a lab-scale, such as self-cleaning, 22 drag reduction, 23 oily wastewater remediation, 24,25 liquid/gas manipulation, [26][27][28] anti-icing, 29,30 anti-fouling/-corrosion, 31,32 enhanced heat transfer, 33 energy harvesting/conversion, 34,35 and biomedical engineering, [36][37][38] just to name a few.Wetting, referring to the process of making contact between a Liquid And a solid (or liquid) surface, is a ubiquitous phenomenon that exists in our daily life, industry, agriculture, biology, etc., from raindrops on a car windshield to drastic shape transition of living tissues.

        <p>Although tremendous progress has been made on the research of these liquid-repellent surfaces, the realization of their real-world applications and industrializations remains challenging. This mainly originates from the poor robustness and durability of the liquid-repellent surfaces. 14,[39][40][41][42] Firstly, it is well known that the liquid repellence of superhydrophobic and superoleophobic surfaces is attributed to the locked air cushion within the rough structures, and that of SLIS originates from the infused lubricant layer, both of which are thermodynamically unstable under some conditions, such as long-term immersion in the repelling liquid, vapor condensation, increased hydraulic pressure, etc. As a result, the super-liquid-repellent surfaces change their wetting from the Cassie-Baxter to the Wenzel state due to the lost air cushion, while the SLIS suffers from the depletion of infused lubricant, thus rendering the loss of liquid repellence. Secondly, micro/nanoscale rough structures and special surface chemistry are generally two essential factors of liquid-repellent surfaces, but these features (especially the rough surface textures) are intrinsically fragile and thereby are highly susceptible to mechanical abrasion, dynamic impacting, peeling, etc., since the local pressure applied on the surface textures is high even when the corresponding mechanical loading is small. Mechanical damage of surface architectures and/or surface chemistry always results in the deterioration of the liquid repellence. Lastly, when liquid-repellent surfaces are exposed to chemically active conditions, such as being immersed in corrosive aqueous solutions, exposed to UV, or treated by plasma, etc., chemical processes often occur on the surfaces either slowly or rapidly, which may change their surface textures and/or surface chemistry, leading to the loss of their liquid repellence.Although tremendous progress has been made on the research of these liquid-repellent surfaces, the realization of their real-world applications and industrializations remains challenging.

        <p>Therefore, extensive efforts have been made to address the robustness and durability of liquid-repellent surfaces in recent years. As shown in Fig. 1, when the topics of "robust or durable" and "superhydrophobi*, superoleophobi* or slippery l*-infused surface" were used to search the publications in the Web of Science, a large number of research articles and reviews could also be found, and the number of these papers increased annually, but its relative proportion was less than a quarter of the publications of liquid-repellent surfaces, indicating that plenty of room exists for the study of robust and durable liquid-repellent surfaces.Therefore, extensive efforts have been made to address the robustness and durability of liquid-repellent surfaces in recent years.

        <p>To improve the robustness and durability of artificial liquid-repellent surfaces, various strategies have been proposed to address the thermodynamic durability, mechanical robustness, chemical durability, or several aspects of them. First of all, the matrix and surface chemistry should be considered, for example, abrasion-tolerant substrates could partially improve the mechanical robustness of liquid-repellent surfaces, 43,44 while carbon-fluorine-based surface agents usually generate better chemical durability than carbon-hydrogen-based groups. 45 Next, various special surface textures, such as re-entrant microstructures, 46,47 densely and closely packed nanostructures, 48 self-similar rough structures, 49 hierarchical micro/nano structures, 50 etc., have been designed to enhance the robustness and durability of liquid-repellent surfaces from different aspects. For those substrates covered with liquid-repellent coatings, increasing the bonding strength among them is a universal and effective strategy. 51 In addition, imparting liquid-repellent surfaces with self-healing property, such as restorable microstructure, self-healable surface chemistry, or both, is another alternative method to improve their durability. 52,53 Moreover, selective combination of the proposed strategies have been recently demonstrated to be more effective in further improving the robustness and durability of liquid-repellent surfaces, 44,[54][55][56] which should be a promising solution for moving liquid-repellent surfaces towards real-world applications.To improve the robustness and durability of artificial liquid-repellent surfaces, various strategies have been proposed to address the thermodynamic durability, mechanical robustness, chemical durability, or several aspects of them.

        <p>Liquid repellence is a fundamental phenomenon of wetting, and liquid-repellent surfaces are generally characterised by extremely anti-wetting property and high liquid droplet mobility. Firstly, a brief introduction of the basic theories of the wetting of solid surface (both in air and liquid) is provided followed by a summary of the commonly used wettability characterisation methods, and finally three typical liquid-repellent surfaces: superhydrophobic surfaces, superoleophobic surfaces, and slippery liquid-infused surfaces (SLISs) are introduced.Liquid repellence is a fundamental phenomenon of wetting, and liquid-repellent surfaces are generally characterised by extremely anti-wetting property and high liquid droplet mobility.

        <p>Wetting generally involves the spreading of a liquid on a solid/liquid surface and the formation of contact line and contact angle (CA) at the triple-phase interface.

        <p>When the wetting of a solid surface occurs in air, a triple-phase interface consisting of solid, gas (i.e., air) and liquid is built, and a CA, θ, which is defined as the angle between the tangent to the liquid-gas interface and the solid surface at the three-phase contact line can be observed, as shown in Fig. 3a. The CA is an indication of how likely the surface is to be wetted by the liquid: low CA means a tendency of the liquid to spread and adhere to the surface, whereas high CA suggests the liquid-repellent tendency of the surface. In 1805, Young first described the CA of an ideal solid surface (i.e., one that is atomically smooth, chemically homogeneous, nonreactive and nondeformable by the liquid or gas) by proposing the Young's model, as depicted in Fig. 3a. 9 For an ideal solid surface wetted by a liquid droplet, the formed CA depends only on the physico-chemical nature (i.e., the surface tension) of the three phases and is independent of both the system geometry and gravity, which is expressed by the Young's equation:When the wetting of a solid surface occurs in air, a triple-phase interface consisting of solid, gas (i.e., air) and liquid is built, and a CA, θ, which is defined as the angle between the tangent to the liquid-gas interface and the solid surface at the three-phase contact line can be observed, as shown in Fig. 3a.

As shown in Fig. 3b, when the liquid-vapor interface slips freely at a certain inclination θI along the solid surface, the variation of the contact areas must meet the geometrical conditions of dASV = -dASL and dALV = dASLcosθI. Then eqn (1) could be deduced thermodynamically, and the inclination θI is equal to θY.where A is the contact interface area.

        <p>However, ideal solid surfaces rarely exist, and real surfaces are usually topographically rough and chemically heterogeneous. For a topographically rough but chemically homogeneous solid surface, its actual (i.e., microscopic) surface is greater than its geometrical (i.e., apparent or macroscopic) surface by a coefficient r, the roughness factor introduced by Wenzel in 1936. 73 In addition, the rough structures at solid-liquid contact area are supposed to be completely filled with the liquid (Fig. 3c). Therefore, the solid-Liquid And solid-vapor contact interfacial area (i.e., ASL and ASV, respectively) should be mathematically multiplied by the factor r, and the Gibbs free energy of the wetting system on such a rough solid surface, Gr, can be written as:However, ideal solid surfaces rarely exist, and real surfaces are usually topographically rough and chemically heterogeneous.

        <p>Classical wetting models proposed by Young, 9 Wenzel 73 and Cassie-Baxter 77 are all based on rigorous thermodynamics, and are thus established on the assumption that Gibbs free energy versus apparent CA of an ideal wetting system has only a single free energy minimum, indicating that a given solid surface has a unique CA value (Fig. 5a). 86,87 However, even mirror-like, nearly atomically smooth and chemically controlled silicon wafer surface has a range of measurable CAs. 88 Fig. 5b shows the Gibbs free energy of a real wetting system as a function of apparent CA, in which multiple free energy minima (i.e., thermodynamic equilibrium states) can be observed, corresponding to the most stable CA at the global minimum and some metastable CAs at the local minima of a real solid surface. Taking 2D droplet wetting on smooth but chemically heterogeneous solid surface with 2D periodic chemical patterns (Fig. 5c) as an example, the relationship between the ideal/apparent CAs and the position of the contact line for a given volume is shown in Fig. 5d. Practical thermodynamic equilibrium can only be achieved when the ideal CA curve intersects with the apparent CA curve (namely, the local ideal CA equal the apparent CA). 89 Therefore, multiple equilibrium positions could be obtained, which correspond to the extremum points in the Gibbs free energy curve (Fig. 5b). Meanwhile, as a finite energy barrier separating every two adjacent equilibrium states exists (Fig. 5b), these CAs can be reached and measured depending on the balance between the energy barrier and the available drop energy. For example, mechanical vibration was suggested to overcome the energy barriers so as to evaluate the most-stable CA. 90 The maximum and minimum apparent CA values in this range are termed as advancing and receding CAs (ACA and RCA, or, θadv and θrec), respectively, and their difference, ∆θ = θadv -θrec, is defined as contact angle hysteresis (CAH).

Typically, in terms of static CA measurement, a liquid droplet with given volume is gently deposited on the solid surface by a dispensing system and a 2D profile of the droplet is then captured by a software-operated high-resolution camera under the assistance of a light source from behind (Fig. 6a). Software-based fitting via image analysis algorithms is then performed to estimate the CA value from the fitted drop shape, baseline and tangent line (Fig. 6b). With regard to CAH (i.e., ACA and RCA) measurement by sessile-drop goniometry, digital images are captured during increasing or decreasing the droplet volume with the needle until the contact line starts to advance or recede on the surface, and the CA values obtained by the software-based fitting are ACA and RCA, respectively (Fig. 6c). More details about the guidelines of sessile-drop goniometry can be found in refs. 101 and 86. The sessile-drop method requires small amount of testing liquids, and can measure both plane and non-planar surfaces with small areas so as to provide their 2D wettability distribution though an amount of time is required. 102,103 However, this method is susceptible to measurement details, such as image analysis, droplet volume, etc. Software-based image analysis of sessile-drop method causes inaccuracies due to optical distortions or blurs originating from experimental details such as magnification, lighting, contrast and camera resolution. 93,104 The optical distortions are obvious at the area close to the three-phase contact line, and become conspicuous for surfaces with large CAs, especially for super liquid-repellent surfaces. Diffuse droplet edge and pixelation make it difficult to precisely determine the droplet shape and baseline even when a high-resolution digital image is taken, leading to systematic errors in CA measurement. For example, as illustrated in Fig. 7a, though a digital image with resolution of 1984 × 1264 pixels is used, error in CA measurement appears due to the baseline displacement providing that the droplet shape is fitted: setting baseline too high decreases CA, while setting it too low increases CA, which is a subjective process.

        <p>Droplet volume (i.e., size) is another key yet under-debated factor that needs to be considered in the sessile-drop method. Shahraz et al. reported that water CA measured on a periodically grooved hydrophobic surface increased when the droplet volume increased from 0.4 nL to 4.5 μL. 105 By contrast, Cansoy studied the effect of water droplet size on CA measurement of superhydrophobic surfaces with varying square pillar sizes and solid area fraction. 106 The results demonstrated that the variation in droplet volume (0.5 μL to 19 μL) had no significant influence on the experimentally measured CA and the deviations between the predicted CAs by the Cassie-Baxter equation and the experimental values. Bell et al. showed that gravity enabled the droplet with small size to flatten and spread across the surface, and even to penetrate surface asperities more favorably, which would tend to lower the measured CA value, while CA became independent of gravity when the size of the droplet was much larger than that of the surface features. 107 A recent work by Ren et al. showed that the volume (5.0 μL to 20 μL) of four resting liquids (water, glycerol, ethylene glycol and hexadecane) had no significant effect on the measured CA values of both natural Lotus leaf and artificial superhydrophobic coating. It was also demonstrated theoretically that only a small change in the three-phase line length was needed to re-balance the forces exerted to the droplet when its volume changed, so the contact ratio of solid-Liquid And gas-liquid changed insignificantly, resulting in negligible change in CA. 108 Therefore, to reliably characterise surface wettability via CA and CAH measurements by sessile-drop goniometry, larger droplet should be preferably employed, and the volume of a few microliters is generally recommended. Most work conventionally considered the effect of gravity on CA measurement by the sessile drop technique to be negligible because the radius of the adopted droplets was generally smaller than the capillary length. 86 However, recently Extrand et al. clarified that gravity-induced sagging or distortion of sessile droplet always led to the underprediction of the CA via conventional circular-segment approximation method, especially for those droplets with lower surface tension or larger density depositing on super-liquid-repellent surfaces, the underestimation could reach up to tens of degrees. 109 To address this concern, strategies like employing small sessile droplets (on the order of hundreds of picolitres), 109 estimating CA by using the maximum droplet width and height, 110 and Cassie-levitating droplet model 111 have been proposed to improve the accuracy of CA measurement. Moreover, Kim et al.Droplet volume (i.e., size) is another key yet under-debated factor that needs to be considered in the sessile-drop method.

Bell et al. showed that gravity enabled the droplet with small size to flatten and spread across the surface, and even to penetrate surface asperities more favorably, which would tend to lower the measured CA value, while CA became independent of gravity when the size of the droplet was much larger than that of the surface features. 107 A recent work by Ren et al. showed that the volume (5.0 μL to 20 μL) of four resting liquids (water, glycerol, ethylene glycol and hexadecane) had no significant effect on the measured CA values of both natural Lotus leaf and artificial superhydrophobic coating. It was also demonstrated theoretically that only a small change in the three-phase line length was needed to re-balance the forces exerted to the droplet when its volume changed, so the contact ratio of solid-Liquid And gas-liquid changed insignificantly, resulting in negligible change in CA. 108 Therefore, to reliably characterise surface wettability via CA and CAH measurements by sessile-drop goniometry, larger droplet should be preferably employed, and the volume of a few microliters is generally recommended. Most work conventionally considered the effect of gravity on CA measurement by the sessile drop technique to be negligible because the radius of the adopted droplets was generally smaller than the capillary length. 86 However, recently Extrand et al. clarified that gravity-induced sagging or distortion of sessile droplet always led to the underprediction of the CA via conventional circular-segment approximation method, especially for those droplets with lower surface tension or larger density depositing on super-liquid-repellent surfaces, the underestimation could reach up to tens of degrees. 109 To address this concern, strategies like employing small sessile droplets (on the order of hundreds of picolitres), 109 estimating CA by using the maximum droplet width and height, 110 and Cassie-levitating droplet model 111 have been proposed to improve the accuracy of CA measurement. Moreover, Kim et al.</p>
        <p>demonstrated that the ACA and RCA were not affected by gravity, while the overall shape of the droplet and the position of the pinning point were affected by gravity, and that the gravitational effect played a key role in the movement of the droplet tip during continuously increasing or decreasing the volume of the droplet. 112 Additionally, other measurement details such as the resting time of deposited droplet on surface, 113,114 temperature, 115 and dispense rate as well as the distance between the dispense needle and the surface should also be considered in CA and CAH measurement by the sessile-drop goniometry. 116 Another commonly-used yet under-debated optical method to measure CAH is tilting-plate method, in which the tilting angle of the surface with a droplet is gradually increased until the droplet starts moving, and after fitting the corresponding digital image, the CAs measured from the leading and trailing edges of the distorted droplet are regarded as ACA and RCA, respectively (Fig. 6d). However, the CAs on two edges of a droplet on a tilted plate are not independent of each other. Krasovitski et al. found that the CAs at the leading and trailing edges did not always simultaneously equal the ACA and RCA, respectively. 117 They clarified that on a hydrophobic surface, the CA at the trailing edge tended to be approximately equal to the RCA, while the CA at the leading edge might be much lower than the ACA; but for a hydrophilic surface, the CA at the trailing edge was lower than the RCA, whereas the CA at the leading edge was roughly equal to the ACA. Pierce et al. demonstrated that CAH measured by tilting-plate method was liquid volume-dependent, which is contrary to the fact that the CAH is a surface property that does not depend on droplet size. 118 Therefore, the obtained results from the tilting-plate method are not necessarily representing reliable CAH, and this method is sometimes not recommended.demonstrated that the ACA and RCA were not affected by gravity, while the overall shape of the droplet and the position of the pinning point were affected by gravity, and that the gravitational effect played a key role in the movement of the droplet tip during continuously increasing or decreasing the volume of the droplet. 112 Additionally, other measurement details such as the resting time of deposited droplet on surface, 113,114 temperature, 115 and dispense rate as well as the distance between the dispense needle and the surface should also be considered in CA and CAH measurement by the sessile-drop goniometry. 116 Another commonly-used yet under-debated optical method to measure CAH is tilting-plate method, in which the tilting angle of the surface with a droplet is gradually increased until the droplet starts moving, and after fitting the corresponding digital image, the CAs measured from the leading and trailing edges of the distorted droplet are regarded as ACA and RCA, respectively (Fig. 6d).

The Wilhelmy balance method 126 proposed in 1863 is another ancient technique used for measuring CA and CAH of a solid surface. 127 Generally, as shown in Fig. 9a, a thin plate sample is dipped vertically into the testing liquid, the total forces acting on the plate include the gravity (Gp), the capillary force due to surface tension of the liquid (Fc), the buoyancy force (Fb), and the plate holding force measured by the microbalance force sensor (Fm). Since the thickness of the plate is much smaller than the other two dimensions, the form drag (i.e., pressure drag) is negligible. The CA of the plate surface cannot be directedly measured but can be determined based on the following force balance equation:2.2.1.3 Wilhelmy balance method.

Fig. 9c illustrates a typical curve of Fm vs immersion depth h for the dynamic Wilhelmy balance method. The Wilhelmy plate method is regarded as a fully automatic and thus "operator-error-free" technique for CA characterisation, and had been expected to obtain more accurate and highly reproducible CA values than other experimental methods, but this advantage is gradually diminishing due to rapid development of sessile-drop goniometry. A large surface area is analyzed in the Wilhelmy balance method, thereby making the influence of small surface imperfections/contaminations on the measured CA to be negligible. Additionally, 1D resolution of surface wettability along the advancing/receding direction can be achieved by the Wilhelmy technique. This method is much preferred for CA measurement of plain plate, 128,129 fabric 130 and fiber 131 with rectangular or cylindrical shapes (i.e., a constant perimeter) and same chemistries in both sides.

        <p>Sliding/rolling-off angle (SA/RA) is another common characteristic for the wettability of solid surfaces, especially for liquid-repellent surfaces, since it can easily reflect the mobility of the liquid droplets deposited on the surfaces. Generally, the SA/RA can be measured by the same instruments used in CA measurement via sessile-drop goniometry method with the assistance of a tilting plate. During the measurement process, the solid sample is firstly fixed on the plate horizontally, and then the plate is tilted slowly until the droplet starts to slide or roll, by which time the tilt angle of the plate can be regarded as the SA/RA (i.e., the αtilt shown in Fig. 6d). Thus, the SA/RA denotes the tilting angle at which the gravitational force component of the droplet along the inclined surface (i.e., mgsin αtilt, where m is the mass of the droplet, g is the acceleration of gravity) overcomes the lateral moving resistance that mainly originates from the adhesion force between the solid and liquid, as well as rough structures induced obstruction. Therefore, small SA/RA always indicates weak solid-Liquid Adhesion and high liquid droplet mobility on the surface, making SA/RA indispensable in evaluating the liquid repellence of a solid surface.Sliding/rolling-off angle (SA/RA) is another common characteristic for the wettability of solid surfaces, especially for liquid-repellent surfaces, since it can easily reflect the mobility of the liquid droplets deposited on the surfaces.

        <p>The deflection can be easily detected by a high-resolution camera from the side. For example, Backholm et al. designed a micropipette cantilever-based setup to measure the lateral friction of water droplet moving on a superhydrophobic surface (Fig. 10a). 140 During the measurement, as shown in Fig. 10b, the pre-deposited water droplet with radius of ~ 620 μm was firstly attached to the micropipette cantilever, and was then pulled along the substrate with a constant speed of v ~ 0.1 mm s -1 until the elastic force from the deflected micropipette matched the lateral friction force of the substrate. At this moment, the deflection (Δx) remained nearly constant while the droplet started to slide along the surface. In the recorded force-time curve (Fig. 10c), the average equilibrium position of the micropipette was first recorded for ~ 5 s after which the surface started moving, and the difference between the average zero and kinetic plateau force represented the kinetic friction (Flat ~ 10 ± 4 nN). It was also demonstrated that this method achieved a force resolution of as low as ~ 4 nN, which was up to three orders of magnitude more precise than using eqn (29). The same group further used this method to study the pinning behavior of water droplets on various superhydrophobic surfaces with high spatial resolution. 143 Similarly, the lateral adhesive force measurement of an oil droplet on underwater superoleophobic surface, 144 and that of droplets on SLISs, 145 have also been reported.The deflection can be easily detected by a high-resolution camera from the side.

        <p>Gao et al. employed a position-sensitive detector (PSD) to record the laser beam incident on the capillary (Fig. 10d), which could be then used to calculate Δx with high resolution and accuracy. 146 The authors thereby measured the friction that impeded the lateral motion of liquid droplets on various solid surfaces. As a representative example, Fig. 10e shows the Flat (measured and calculated by both eqns (30) and ( 29)) during the motion of an ionic liquid (1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) on fluorinated silicon wafer. Moving the wafer laterally increased the force until a threshold force of ~ 50 μN was reached (the static regime), upon which the droplet started to slide. Then the force gradually decreased and stabilized at ~ 33 μN (the kinetic regime). It could be seen that the threshold static force was higher than the force required for continuous motion of the droplet, which is analogous to well-known solid-solid friction. Once the threshold adhesion force was overcome, the liquid-solid interaction changed from a static regime to a steady kinetic regime, and the Flat in the two regimes were substantially different due to their dissimilar CAs and contact widths. Their results also showed that Flat depended on the interplay between surface tension and CAH, and for a specific liquid droplet, lower Flat could sometimes indicate better liquid repellence for the solid surface. Moreover, it was demonstrated that Flat could be used to characterise the time-resolved pinning-depinning dynamics of the droplet by moving it across the surface. 147 which is surface structures-dependent due to the liquid meniscus trapped within the rough structures, normal adhesive force (Fnor) reflects the liquid-solid adhesion more directly. Therefore, Fnor has been widely employed to characterise the wettability of liquid-repellent surfaces. [148][149][150] the Fnor between Liquid And superhydrophobic surfaces by attaching a micrometric-sized 40-wt% glycerin-water droplet to an atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilever (Fig. 11a). 147 The vertical force acting on the droplet was linearly proportional to the flexular deflection (Δz) of the AFM cantilever (i.e., be similar to eqn (30)), and Δz was detected by focusing a laser beam onto the cantilever and reflected into a 4-quadrant sensor. Fig. 11b is the measured force spectroscopy for a 30-μm-diameter droplet with volume of 20 ± 2 pL approaching and retracting from one of the superhydrophobic scales of a butterfly wing at v = 10 μm s -1 . It could be seen that when the droplet was approaching towards the solid surface, there was a sudden attractive snap-in force (132 nN) upon contact (z = 0 μm); after slight continuous pressing and then retracting, a maximum adhesion force, Fnor = 720 nN, was obtained when the droplet was completely detached from the surface. Liimatainen et al. measured the Fnor of single hydrophobic micro pillar by a vertically mounted force sensor with a water droplet probe (Fig. 11c), and found that the Fnor &lt; 4500 nN for a 5 μm radius pillar (Fig. 11d), and the force increased with the droplet radius. 151 They also measured the Fnor for various (super)hydrophobic surfaces, and showed that the force was related to both CA and CAH of the surface. More importantly, Fnor measurement can be a desired technique to map the wetting properties of solid surfaces with high spatial and force resolution, even for those non-flat surfaces, which is almost impossible by traditional CA method. 143,147,151 For example, Fig. 11e illustrates the Fnor map of a eyespot area on a butterfly wing, clearly showing low adhesive force (&lt; 3.4 μN) and microscale wettability inhomogeneity of the surface. 151 Recently, Hokkanen et al. used the same technique to map the Fnor of various commercial superhydrophobic coatings, and found that even the best coatings showed regional wettability heterogeneity in sub-mm scale. 143Gao et al. employed a position-sensitive detector (PSD) to record the laser beam incident on the capillary (Fig. 10d), which could be then used to calculate Δx with high resolution and accuracy. 146 The authors thereby measured the friction that impeded the lateral motion of liquid droplets on various solid surfaces. As a representative example, Fig. 10e shows the Flat (measured and calculated by both eqns (30) and ( 29)) during the motion of an ionic liquid (1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) on fluorinated silicon wafer. Moving the wafer laterally increased the force until a threshold force of ~ 50 μN was reached (the static regime), upon which the droplet started to slide. Then the force gradually decreased and stabilized at ~ 33 μN (the kinetic regime). It could be seen that the threshold static force was higher than the force required for continuous motion of the droplet, which is analogous to well-known solid-solid friction. Once the threshold adhesion force was overcome, the liquid-solid interaction changed from a static regime to a steady kinetic regime, and the Flat in the two regimes were substantially different due to their dissimilar CAs and contact widths. Their results also showed that Flat depended on the interplay between surface tension and CAH, and for a specific liquid droplet, lower Flat could sometimes indicate better liquid repellence for the solid surface. Moreover, it was demonstrated that Flat could be used to characterise the time-resolved pinning-depinning dynamics of the droplet by moving it across the surface. 147 which is surface structures-dependent due to the liquid meniscus trapped within the rough structures, normal adhesive force (Fnor) reflects the liquid-solid adhesion more directly.

        <p>proposed to evaluate the water repellence of superhydrophobic textiles qualitatively by water shedding angle (WSA). 152 Briefly, a water droplet was released onto the inclined superhydrophobic surface from a defined height, and the minimum tilting angle at which the droplet completely rolled off from the surface was defined as the WSA. The authors compared the qualitative differences in water repellence of superhydrophobic silicone nanofilament coated textiles, and found that the textile parameters such as fiber dimension, yarn, and weave influenced the WSA. It is obvious that the WSA can only reflect the short-term wetting resistance of a liquid-repellent surface. If a water droplet deposited on a soft porous material maintained a high CA for a while before being completely wicked into the substrate, the WSA was inadequate to judge the overall wetting behavior of the substrate, and additional wettability characterisation methods would be required.proposed to evaluate the water repellence of superhydrophobic textiles qualitatively by water shedding angle (WSA). 152 Briefly, a water droplet was released onto the inclined superhydrophobic surface from a defined height, and the minimum tilting angle at which the droplet completely rolled off from the surface was defined as the WSA.

        <p>proposed to evaluate the hydrophobicity based on the ability of water to bounce on a solid surface. 154 They tested a wide range of surfaces with static water CAs between 0-175°, and found that the surfaces with rounded microstructure showed water bouncing when the CAs were larger than 151°, while surfaces promoting water pinning disabled water to bounce unless the CAs exceed 156°. Moreover, the number of water bouncing increased linearly with the water CA of superhydrophobic surfaces with similar microstructures. This characterisation method for liquid repellence ruled out personal errors in classic CA measurement, enabling it to be a more accessible technique providing results that could be directly compared among different works. Lu et al. further demonstrated that liquid droplet bouncing occurred on soft porous materials, and thereby Liquid Bouncing could be used to define a soft surface as being super liquid-repellent. 153 In addition, solid-liquid/liquid-liquid interface imaging by environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM), 155,156 AFM, 157 confocal microscopy, 44,158,159 etc. has also been widely used to characterise the wettability of solid surfaces. Taking confocal microscopy as an example, liquids (and solids) are generally fluorescently dyed, which enabled fluorescence emission under photoexcitation. Then the emission signals from different dyes and the reflected light from the interfaces are recorded, for example, by laser scanning confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 12a, when a water droplet was deposited on a superhydrophobic surface, a visible air layer (i.e., Cassie-Baxter wetting state) could be seen with the assistance of solid-liquid interface imaging. 44 The confocal microscopy image of SLIS could visualize the lubricant layer underneath the droplet and the wetting ridge (Fig. 12b), as well as the cloaking (wrapping) layer, 158 which favors the understanding of the special wetting properties of SLIS. Li et al. used confocal fluorescence and reflection interference contrast microscopy to demonstrate the role of hierarchical micro-and nano-structures on underwater superoleophobicity (Fig. 12c). 159 Imaging of the solid-liquid interfaces can be an alternative technique to study the dynamic behaviors of the moving droplet (e.g., measurement of ACA and RCA, pinning and depinning, Fig. 12d), 160 and wetting state transition (Fig. 12e). 161 Moreover, these confocal microscopy images could be used to determine the droplet shape and baseline more accurately, thus facilitating the static CA measurement, as shown in Fig. 12b andc.

        <p>Due to their extremely low CAH, low adhesion, and high mobility towards water droplets (i.e., the Cassie-Baxter wetting state), superhydrophobic surfaces with water CAs larger than 150° and RAs smaller than 10° are the most fascinating water-repellent surfaces. The research of superhydrophobic surfaces can be dated back to 1944 when duck feather was reported to be water-repellent, and the importance of rough structure for water repellence was first emphasized. 77 Barthlott et al. studied the self-cleaning property of the Lotus leaf (Fig. 13a), and found that the epidermal microscale papillae (Fig. 13b) and epicuticular wax crystalloids were the key to its water repellence. 15 Jiang's group further reported that the micro-and nano-scale two-tier structures (i.e., microscale papillae covered with branch-like nanostructures, Fig. 13c) enabled the upper surface of a Lotus leaf to possess high CA (~ 161.0 ± 2.7°) and low SA (~ 2°). 16 Since then, various superhydrophobic surfaces in nature, such as rice leaf, 16 legs of water strider, 162 butterfly wings, 163 mosquito compound eyes, 164 taro leaf, 165 etc. have been discovered, and shown that the air cushion underneath the water droplet and the low solid-liquid fractional area (i.e., the Cassie-Baxter wetting state) are critical for superhydrophobic surfaces with large CA and small CAH, which further boost the modern development of artificial super water-repellent surfaces. [166][167][168] Comparatively, nature also provides some superhydrophobic but not super water-repellent surfaces, referred to as high-adhesive superhydrophobic surfaces, such as rose petal, 169 Salvinia leaf, 170 gecko feet, 171 peanut leaf, 172 etc. The water CAs of rose petal and peanut leaf are indeed larger than 150°, but water droplets adhere to the surfaces and cannot roll off even when the petal or leaf are turned upside down due to the formed Cassie impregnating wetting state on the petal surface 169 and quasi-continuous three-phase contact line at the microscale on the peanut leaf surface. 172 The high water adhesive forces of Salvinia leaf and gecko feet, respectively, originate from the hydrophilic patches distributed on superhydrophobic surfaces 170 and the contact between water and high-density nanopillars. 171 Therefore, these high-adhesive superhydrophobic surfaces are not discussed in this review. The past twenty years have witnessed an all-round development of superhydrophobic surfaces. Based on the strategy of "micro-and/or nanoscale rough structures + low surface energy chemistry", various elegant methods and their combinations have been proposed to prepare superhydrophobic surfaces, such as chemical etching/deposition, [174][175][176] self-assembly, 177,178 electrochemical methods, 179,180 electrospinning, 181,182 hydrothermal method, 183,184 plasma exposure, 185,186 laser based ablation and 3D printing, [187][188][189][190] templating, 64,191,192 spraying, [193][194][195] and so on. 196,197 making it energetically favorable for oils to wet most of the super water-repellent surfaces. Therefore, surfaces with superoleophobicity could be more desired in terms of liquid repellence in oily environments. To the best of our knowledge, the first superoleophobic surface in air was reported in 1997 by Tsujii et al. who modified an anodically oxidized aluminum surface with fluorinated monoalkylphosphates. 198 They showed that a rapeseed oil droplet on the prepared surface remained spherical shape with a CA of 150°, and could roll around without attaching when the surface was slightly tilted. However, insufficient understanding of the critical factors for superoleophobicity limited the continuous development of super oil-repellent surfaces in the following 10 years.

        <p>Due to the higher surface tension of water, most surfaces that are superoleophobic in air are also superhydrophobic, which has led them to be termed as superamphiphobic, 17,200,213 omniphobic 46,185,205 or superomniphobic 185,226,227 surfaces. However, some studies show that special design of the surface chemistry (e.g., using fluorosurfactant that contains a low surface tension fluorinated tail and a high surface tension head group) enables the as-prepared surfaces to be both superoleophobic and superhydrophilic in air. 201,202,[228][229][230] Water molecules induced surface reconfiguration is widely adopted to explain this counterintuitive phenomenon since complete water spreading (i.e., water CA decreased to ~ 0°) always takes some time (typically tens of seconds to several minutes or even longer). 228,229 Brown et al. fabricated a superoleophobic-superhydrophilic surface by a layer-by-layer technique and deposition of fluorosurfactant (Capstone FS-50, DuPont), which showed super oil-repellence and rapid water wetting (within 2 s). 230 They attributed this to the molecule size difference between oil and water: larger oil molecules are blocked by the top fluorinated layer while smaller water molecules can penetrate through the top layer and contacting with the underlying hydrophilic region. 230,231 Recently, Pan's group fabricated various superoleophobic-superhydrophilic surfaces with rapid response for both oil repellence and water spreading, and proposed a theory based on the dispersive and non-dispersive component of surface free energy. 201,202 For example, the sprayed coating from the mixture of TiO2 nanoparticles and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, CF3(CF2)6COOH) showed superamphobicity (Fig. 14e) because the non-dispersive and dispersive components of its surface free energy are both low. However, after replacing the hydrogen atom of PFOA with sodium (Na) atom, the non-dispersive component became higher while the dispersive component remained low since the fluorocarbon chains were unchanged.Due to the higher surface tension of water, most surfaces that are superoleophobic in air are also superhydrophobic, which has led them to be termed as superamphiphobic, 17,200,213 omniphobic 46,185,205 or superomniphobic 185,226,227 surfaces.

        <p>Therefore, the sprayed coating consisting of TiO2 nanoparticles and sodium perfluorooctanoate (CF3(CF2)6COONa) showed superoleophobicity and superhydrophilicity (Fig. 14f andg) as the fluorocarbon chains repels the nonpolar oil, whereas the hydrophilic Na + attracts the polar water.Therefore, the sprayed coating consisting of TiO2 nanoparticles and sodium perfluorooctanoate (CF3(CF2)6COONa) showed superoleophobicity and superhydrophilicity (Fig. 14f andg) as the fluorocarbon chains repels the nonpolar oil, whereas the hydrophilic Na + attracts the polar water.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Sun et al. fabricated superoleophobic-superhydrophilic surfaces by using Capstone FS-50 modified SiO2 nanoparticles, which could be rapidly wetted by highly polar liquids (e.g., water) while completely repel nonpolar oily liquids (e.g., n-hexadecane). 2.3.2.2 Superoleophobic surface underwater. In 2009, Liu et al. reported that fish scales with superhydrophilicity in air shows superoleophobicity underwater. 19 Fish scales are composed of calcium phosphate, protein, and a thin layer of mucus; the surface morphology is characterised by oriented rough micropapillae with length of 100-300 μm and width of 30-40 μm (Fig. 15a), enabling the scales to be superhydrophilic and superoleophilic in air (Fig. 15b). When an oil droplet comes into contact with the fish scales that were immersed in water, the trapped water in the micro/nano structures assists the formation of an oil-water-solid composite interface that coincides with the Cassie-Baxter wetting model, thereby showing underwater superoleophobicity with CA of 156.4 ± 3.0° for 1,2-dichloroethane droplet (Fig. 15c). In the following years, some other natural creatures with underwater superoleophobic surfaces have also been discovered, such as the lower side of Lotus leaf, 233 clam's shell, 234 filefish skin, 235 seaweed, 236 aloe vera mucilage, 237 pomfret skin, 238 etc. The construction of underwater superoleophobic surface is based on introducing the repulsive water phase into the roughly structured hydrophilic surface, which opens up a new research area for super oil-repellent surfaces. 19 It has been proven that the combination of hydrophilicity in air and roughness generally endows surfaces with superoleophobicity underwater. 19,59,[233][234][235][236] Therefore, the strategy to fabricate underwater superoleophobic surface focuses on creating superhydrophilic surface in air, and many methods have been employed to construct such underwater super oil-repellent surfaces, such as dip-/spray-coating, 239,240 chemical treatment, 241,242 electrochemical method, 243,244 plasma exposure, [245][246][247] electrospinning, 181,248 thermal treatment, 249,250 lithography, 251 laser texturing, 252 etc.Similarly, Sun et al. fabricated superoleophobic-superhydrophilic surfaces by using Capstone FS-50 modified SiO2 nanoparticles, which could be rapidly wetted by highly polar liquids (e.g., water) while completely repel nonpolar oily liquids (e.g., n-hexadecane). 2.3.2.2 Superoleophobic surface underwater.

        <p>Although superhydrophobic and superoleophobic surfaces always possess excellent liquid repellence, most of them suffer from poor mechanical robustness, weak air cushion stability in terms of high pressure or liquid intrusion. 11 Inspired by carnivorous plants such as Nepenthes pitcher plant (Fig. 16a), which captures prey by a slippery, water-infused surface at the rim of the pitcher, 253 Wong et al. reported slippery liquid-infused surfaces (SLISs) by infiltrating epoxy-resin-based nanofabricated post array or Teflon-based porous nanofiber network with perfluorinated liquids (such as 3M Fluorinert FC-70, DuPont Krytox 100 and 103) (Fig. 16b). 20 The infused liquid is locked in place by the micro/nano structures and forms a physically smooth and chemically homogeneous lubricating film on the solid surface. When a droplet of another immiscible liquid contacts the SLIS, a liquid-liquid interface between the infused Liquid And droplet is created, and an infused liquid "cushion" retains beneath the testing liquid, preventing the solid surface from being wetted by the testing liquid (Fig. 16c). Depending on the surface tension of the infused liquid, SLIS is characterised by exceptional liquid repellence (negligible CAHs and low SAs for low surface tension liquids and their complex mixtures), instantaneous and repeatable self-healing after mechanical damage, and extreme pressure stability, all of which are advantages over traditional superhydrophobic and superoleophobic surfaces, 11 thereby making SLIS to become another fascinating candidate of liquid-repellent surfaces in the past decade.

        <p>To prepare SLIS successfully, three main design criteria must be met: 20 (i) the infused liquid must wick into, wet and stably adhere within the substrate, (ii) the solid surface must be preferentially wetted by the infused liquid rather than by the testing liquid that is to be repelled, namely, the surface tensions of the infused Liquid And testing liquid, and the interfacial tension at the liquid-liquid interface must satisfy eqns ( 12)-( 14), and (iii) the infused Liquid And the testing liquid must be immiscible. Hydrophobic and porous/textured substrates are generally combined to construct SLISs since micro/nano structures and low solid surface energy favor the immobilization and stabilization of the infused liquids via capillary forces and intermolecular forces. 20,257,258 However, recent works have demonstrated that hydrophilic smooth surfaces can also be imparted with slippery liquid repellence via some ingenious strategies, such as immobilizing infused liquid via π-OH or π-COOH interactions, 259,260 and covalent graft of liquid-like polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based brushes. 139,[261][262][263][264][265][266][267][268][269] For example, Wang et al. prepared slippery liquid-like omniphobic coatings on hydrophilic smooth glass slides by covalently grafting PDMS brushes through rapid acid-catalyzed polycondensation of dimethyldimethoxysilane monomers (Fig. 17a,b). 139 Fang et al. fabricated a highly smooth (roughness of &lt; 1 nm), ultrathin (thickness of ~ 2 nm) and transparent slippery "liquid-like" coating on silicon wafer substrate through one-step condensation under heating (100 °C for 24 h). 270 The grafted PDMS chains possess high mobility through rotational and/or bending motions since only one end is covalently grafted to the surface, 271 and the mobile PDMS chains can facilitate the motion of triple-phase contact lines by minimizing the Gibbs free energy barriers between metastable states, which imparts the coated surfaces with excellent liquid repellence (Fig. 17c). 139 It is further demonstrated that the PDMS-grafted layer creates chemical affinity to nonpolar liquids, enabling the immobilization of silicone oil, which makes hydrophilic flat surfaces to be slippery and repellent towards various liquids and even soft viscoelastic solids. 272,273 Additionally, swelling flat polymer matrixes by suitable infusing liquids are also proved to be effective in preparing SLISs, and the most common combination is PDMS swelling in silicon oil. [274][275][276][277] Recently, Salbaum et al. proposed to confine ionic liquids to the underlying flat substrate by swelling of polymeric gels that were functionalized to match the chemical structure of the ionic liquids, their molecular interactions were maximized and thus yielded an enduring slippery ionic liquid-infused organogels. 278 3 Robustness and Durability of Liquid-Repellent SurfacesTo prepare SLIS successfully, three main design criteria must be met: 20 (i) the infused liquid must wick into, wet and stably adhere within the substrate, (ii) the solid surface must be preferentially wetted by the infused liquid rather than by the testing liquid that is to be repelled, namely, the surface tensions of the infused Liquid And testing liquid, and the interfacial tension at the liquid-liquid interface must satisfy eqns ( 12)-( 14), and (iii) the infused Liquid And the testing liquid must be immiscible.

        <p>The liquid repellence of superhydrophobic and superoleophobic (both in air and underwater) surfaces relies on the air or water cushion trapped/locked in the rough structures (i.e., the Cassie-Baxter wetting state), and that of SLIS originates from the infused liquid layer. Thermodynamic durability of these liquid-repellent surfaces refers to the stability of the air or liquid cushions during contact with testing liquids. It is well established that the air cushion beneath testing liquid is indispensable to build the Cassie-Baxter wetting state of superhydrophobic and superoleophobic (in air) surfaces with super liquid repellence. However, the trapped air cushion could be destroyed under some conditions that the surfaces typically undergo during use, which finally leads to a so-called Cassie-Baxter to Wenzel transition (also termed as impalement), and thereby resulting in the pinning of liquid droplet and loss of super liquid repellence. 13,279,[281][282][283] The wetting transition occurs when the wetting pressure exceeds the capillary pressure of the meniscus, 283 and it has been observed in many scenarios.

        <p>Wenzel, leaving the droplet to stick on the surface (Fig. 18a). 283,284 Liquid droplet/jet impacting on super liquid-repellent surface leads to either complete rebound of the droplet with the air cushion retained (i.e., Cassie-Baxter state) or partial/total sticking with the cushion abated (i.e., Wenzel state), as illustrated in Fig. 18b, which depends on the surface tension of the impacting liquid, impacting speed, surface structure and ambient conditions. 282,[285][286][287][288][289] It has also been demonstrated that the impalement of liquid droplet happens when its volume decreased due to evaporation (Fig. 18c), which is attributed to the increased Laplace pressure of small droplet. [290][291][292][293] Vapor condensation on super liquid-repellent surfaces forms randomly distributed nanodroplets within rough textures, which gradually bridge together and grow to be droplets in the Wenzel wetting state, resulting in the loss of liquid repellence when vapor condensate occurred or hot water contacted the surface (Fig. 18d). 155,180,294,295 Another frequently-meet and significant situation for the wetting model transition is immersing the surface in the repelled liquid (either static or flowing), where a gradual disappearance of the cushion is observed (Fig. 18e), and this generally results from liquid static pressure, air diffusion driven by chemical potential gradient, and/or shear stress induced deformation/detachment of the air bubbles. 279,[296][297][298][299] Additionally, some other mechanisms, such as vibration, 300,301 water hammer pressure, [302][303][304] electrowetting, [305][306][307] electrostatic attraction 150 and electric field adaptive deformation, 149 have also been reported to induce the cushion instability and thus wetting transition. For the underwater superoleophobic surface, the locked water within the rough micro/nano structures serves as a repulsive cushion that prevents oil from contacting with the solid surface directly. The underwater Cassie-Baxter state for oil/water/solid wetting system is documented to be thermodynamically stable during long-term immersion in water, 238,241,245,308 and the destruction of the water cushion has been rarely observed hitherto even if the testing oil droplet is severely pressured by a preloading force. 243 However, as superoleophobicity underwater is closely connected with the superhydrophilicity in air (i.e., water hydration ability), 19,59,[233][234][235][236] it should be emphasized that superhydrophilic surfaces exposed to air often (not always) show thermodynamical instability, [309][310][311] although the quantitative/qualitative relationship between the instability of water wettability in air and resultant change of underwater oil wettability has not been well-addressed yet. Superhydrophilic surface exposed to air tends to reorganize in order to minimize its interfacial energy to maintain equilibrium, this thermodynamically driven instability is extensively observed in plasma induced (super)hydrophilic modification, which is also termed as aging behavior, and some possible mechanisms for the instability are proposed, such as reorientation of polar groups, diffusion of low molecular weight species and adsorption of organic contaminants from air. [312][313][314] Chen et al. elucidated that the instability of superhydrophilic surfaces in air is closely related to the surface micro/nano structure, surface chemistry, ambient temperature and relative humidity, etc. 310,311,315 It was also showed that storing in water favors the long-term stability of superhydrophilic surface (Fig. 19a), 310 which is consistent with the ever-lasting underwater superoleophobicity (Fig. 19b). 238,241,245,308 The infused liquid layer is critical for the liquid repellence of SLIS due to its defect-free and smooth features, and intrinsically immiscibility towards testing liquid, which nearly eliminates the pinning of liquid contact line. 20 SLIS is reported to be surprisingly stable towards pressure up to ~ 680 atm, which is equivalent to the hydrostatic pressure at a depth of ~ 7 km. 20 However, thermodynamic instability of the lubricant always leads to its depletion, which inevitably results in the failure of SLISs. Gravimetric drainage, 275 evaporation, 316,317 immersing in other liquids, [318][319][320] and liquid droplets/jet impinging or sliding 317,321,322 are mostly considered incentives for the lubricant loss. When a testing droplet is deposited on SLIS, the redistribution of the lubricant layer on the surfaces occurs, and the interconnected lubricant dynamics subsequently results in the formation of wetting ridge around the droplet. Then the movement of the droplet generates shear force and drags the lubricant meniscus downhill, which dominates the depletion of the lubricant. 321 Tress et al. demonstrated that decreasing the lubricant thickness would increase the extra height of the wetting ridge, leading to the acceleration of lubricant depletion via droplet sliding. 317 Kreder et al. found that the lubricant depletion rate was related to the capillary number of the two liquid-phases system (Ca = ηv/γLV, where η, v, and γLV is the viscosity, velocity and surface tension of the droplet, respectively). 321 Their findings showed that droplets with higher Ca deplete much less lubricant than slower-moving droplets on less viscous lubricants (Fig. 20a), indicating counterintuitively that those faster moving droplets created higher shearing force but less lubricant depletion. It was also demonstrated that the volume of the wetting ridge nearly equaled that of the lost lubricant (Fig. 20b), confirming that wetting ridge was the main source of lubricant depletion during a moving droplet swept across a SLIS. Adera et al. studied the lubricant depletion caused by pendant water droplets on horizontal copper tube with nanostructured outside SLIS during condensation. 322 They revealed that droplets falling from tube surface broke unequally and left behind small satellite droplets that retained the bulk of the lubricant in the wetting ridge (Fig. 20c andd), which was totally different from the droplets sliding off from tilted flat SLISs where the entire wetting ridge left the surface upon droplet departure. In addition, when eqn (14) was met, a highly non-uniform both spatially and temporally layer of lubricant wrapped on the droplet (i.e., cloaking). Although the lubricant depletion by cloaking layer was demonstrated to be much less than that by wetting ridge, 321,322 it still needs to be well considered in terms of the thermodynamic durability of SLIS.Wenzel, leaving the droplet to stick on the surface (Fig. 18a). 283,284 Liquid droplet/jet impacting on super liquid-repellent surface leads to either complete rebound of the droplet with the air cushion retained (i.e., Cassie-Baxter state) or partial/total sticking with the cushion abated (i.e., Wenzel state), as illustrated in Fig. 18b, which depends on the surface tension of the impacting liquid, impacting speed, surface structure and ambient conditions. 282,[285][286][287][288][289] It has also been demonstrated that the impalement of liquid droplet happens when its volume decreased due to evaporation (Fig. 18c), which is attributed to the increased Laplace pressure of small droplet.

        <p>Sandpaper abrasion (Fig. 21c) is probably the most widely selected mechanical robustness testing method in the literature, 40,51,62,240,[333][334][335][336][337][338] as it does not require specialized or professional equipment, and can offer quantitative analysis of the robustness. Typically, the liquid-repellent surface is placed face-down to a sandpaper, and a loading is applied on the solid substrate to provide normal pressure, then the substrate is moved along the tangential direction with a certain speed and distance. Longitudinal and then transverse abrasion or vice versa is suggested to be defined as one abrasion cycle. 51 Abrasion degree from the sandpaper can be adjusted by the grit number (i.e., granularity) of sandpaper, the mass of applied loading (i.e., pressure), and the speed and distance of each abrasion cycle. Fig. 21d illustrates the SEM images of a spray-coated commercial superhydrophobic coating (Neverwet) before and after sandpaper abrasion under a pressure of 10 kPa for 4.0 m, showing obvious surface textures damage and thus a CA decreasing from 156° to 92°. 49 However, sandpaper abrasion is sometimes time-consuming when too many abrasion cycles are required, especially for those abrasion-tolerant surfaces.

        <p>Linear and circular abrasions by tribometer (Fig. 21e,g) are recently popular in mechanical robustness testing of liquid-repellent surfaces due to their advantages in automation and qualitative analysis. 40,44,265,326,327,335,337,339 For example, Wang et al. showed that superhydrophobic surfaces coated with commercial Ultra-Ever Dry coating lost their super water repellence after 100 cycles linear abrasions due to nearly complete removal of the surface micro/nano structures (Fig. 21f). 44 Peng et al. performed the circular abrasion of an all-organic superhydrophobic nanocomposite coatings using an ASTM standard (D4060) Taber abrasion technique, and found that the area under drastic abrasion (100 cycles) suffered from obvious plastic deformation (Fig. 21h), leading to the partial loss of their superhydrophobicity. 326 These tests are generally conducted as follows: the testing surface is fixed upward on the sample platform of a standard equipment (e.g., Taber abrasion machine), and then the abradant (e.g., steel ball, indenter and abrasive wheels) makes contact with the surface under a normal loading, following which the abrasion testing starts automatically under to-and-fro feed movement of the abradant or rotation of the platform with the pre-set loading and speed.

        <p>Rain, sand and wind storms are typical harsh conditions in outdoor application scenarios for liquid-repellent surfaces. For example, the raindrops in a thunderstorm have maximum diameters of 4-5 mm, and the impacting speed reaches up to 7-9 m s -1 on a solid surface with a frequency of 3.88 × 10 5 drops m -2 h -1 . 341 Intensive impacting could cause fracture of the surface textures and/or removal of the infused-liquid of the liquid-repellent surfaces, which could negatively affect their liquid repellence. Therefore, much attention has to be paid to the dynamic impacting induced potential fragility, and some artificial impacting methods are proposed to address this issue, including falling sand, liquid droplet, liquid jet, etc. 40,41,280 Falling sand impacting is often employed to study the influence of solid particles impacting on liquid-repellent surfaces. 213,214,266,327,334,[342][343][344] As depicted in Fig. 21k, in this testing, the liquid-repellent surface is fixed with a tilting angle (usually 45°), and the pre-collected sand is placed in a container and located above the surface, then the sand is dropped down, accelerated by gravity and finally impacts on the surface. As reported by Wu et al., one of their superhydrophobic coatings lost its superhydrophobicity (water CA decreased from ~ 164° to ~ 140°, while SA increased from &lt; 10° to 24°) after falling sand impacting, due to obvious flattening of the surface rough structures (Fig. 21l). 214 Wu et al. showed that falling sand impacting invalidated the liquid repellence and biofouling resistance of a SLIS (perfluoropolyether oil infused porous PTFE membranes), 266 which probably originated from the cooperative effect of rough structures change and lubricant depletion. Impacting energy (i.e., velocity) of the falling sand is mainly affected by the falling height, 213,214 which partly determines the impacting force and thereby the damage degree to the liquid-repellent surfaces. However, the hitherto reported maximum falling height is 1.1 m, 327 corresponding to an impacting velocity of ~ 4.7 m s -1 , which is far below the typical sand speed in a sandstorm (&gt; 10 m s -1 ). 345 High speed liquid droplet/jet impacting is also frequently used for the mechanical robustness testing of liquid-repellent surfaces (Fig. 21m).

        <p>Binding strength is of great significance for the longevity of liquid-repellent surfaces fabricated by additive strategies like spray-/dip-coating and 3D printing, because external force action could cause mechanical peel-off of the coatings and thereby invalidate the liquid repellence. Tape peeling is a common approach used to assess the bonding strength between liquid-repellent coatings and solid substrates. [326][327][328]336,344,348,349 As depicted in Fig. 21n, the substrate is placed horizontally to the liquid-repellent coating upward, then adhesive tape is applied and uniformly pressed (usually by using a cylindrical block as a roller) for a while to adhere to the underneath coating, following which the tape is peeled off. Based on this testing, both the coating removal rate (e.g., according to the ASTM standard D3359-17) and wettability change of the surface can be obtained. For example, Qing et al. showed that when a superhydrophobic 1,1,2,2-tetrahydroperfluorodecyltrimethoxysilane-TiO2/PDMS coating was directly deposited on glass substrate, it could be easily removed by tape peeling, which obviously decreased its water repellence (Fig. 21o). 328 Tape peeling can quantitatively evaluate the resistance of liquid-repellent coating towards mechanical peeling-off, and its result is significantly affected by the adhesive ability of the tape, and the pressing force.Binding strength is of great significance for the longevity of liquid-repellent surfaces fabricated by additive strategies like spray-/dip-coating and 3D printing, because external force action could cause mechanical peel-off of the coatings and thereby invalidate the liquid repellence.

For example, building walls with lotus-like self-cleaning ability are often exposed to direct sunlight and acid rain, ship hulls with drag-reduced surfaces are always immersed in corrosive seawater, superhydrophobic transmission lines may suffer from extremely low temperature, and so on. It is therefore vitally important to emphasize the chemical durability of liquid-repellent surfaces.Potential chemical processes have to be prudently considered for the real applications of liquid-repellent surfaces, especially under some harsh conditions, since they could cause a change in surface textures and/or surface chemistry, resulting in deterioration of the liquid repellence.

By contrast, immersing the liquid-repellent surfaces into corrosive solutions for a certain period and then depicting their wettability could be a relatively reliable way to evaluate the chemical resistance. Another technique to test the chemical resistance of liquid-repellent surface is accelerated electrochemical corrosion in corrosive solutions (e.g., 3.5 wt% NaCl solution) on an electrochemical workstation, during which potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) can be obtained. 45,362,363 Generally, a three-electrode configuration, with liquid-repellent surface as the working electrode (WE), a platinum electrode as the counter electrode (CE), and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode (RE), is used in this testing.

Based on the EIS results, many useful data can be collected to evaluate the corrosion behavior of the tested samples, such as the Nyquist plots and corresponding equivalent circuit models, Bode plots of impedance modulus (|Z|) vs frequency and phase angle vs frequency, etc. For example, it was demonstrated that the larger diameter of capacitive loop in the Nyquist plot and bigger value of |Z| at low frequency (e.g., |Z| at f = 0.01 Hz, termed as |Z|f = 0.01 Hz) in the Bode plot revealed the better corrosion resistance. Moreover, the Bode phase angle plots indicated that the samples with the better corrosion resistance had higher and more stable phase angle maxima across a wider range of frequency. Overall, the accelerated electrochemical corrosion testing could provide more quantifiable data based on PDP and EIS, enabling us to evaluate the chemical durability of liquid-repellent surfaces quantificationally and convincingly.where M, ρ, and V is respectively the molar mass, density, and valence state of the tested substrates.

Based on the EIS results, many useful data can be collected to evaluate the corrosion behavior of the tested samples, such as the Nyquist plots and corresponding equivalent circuit models, Bode plots of impedance modulus (|Z|) vs frequency and phase angle vs frequency, etc. For example, it was demonstrated that the larger diameter of capacitive loop in the Nyquist plot and bigger value of |Z| at low frequency (e.g., |Z| at f = 0.01 Hz, termed as |Z|f = 0.01 Hz) in the Bode plot revealed the better corrosion resistance. Moreover, the Bode phase angle plots indicated that the samples with the better corrosion resistance had higher and more stable phase angle maxima across a wider range of frequency.

        <p>When liquid-repellent surfaces make contact with organic solvents, potential physicochemical processes may occur, such as adsorption of the solvents, dissolution or swelling of the substrate and/or the surface coating, etc., making it necessary to test the durability of liquid repellence towards organic solvents. 332,353,364 For example, Wang et al. prepared a superamphiphobic surface on cotton fabric by dip-coating a mixed suspension of fluorodecyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes, TiO2 and PTFE particles, and showed that the water CA of the fabric decreased from 164° to 128° after being contaminated by oleic acid. 332 Cross-linked PDMS, which is typically used as a coating with low surface energy for superhydrophobic surface or a versatile matrix for SLIS, has been demonstrated to be unstable upon organic solvents (e.g., toluene, chloroform, and silicon oil) invasion. 227,276,277,323 In addition, for a SLIS with infused lubricant (Liquid A) and a testing organic solvent (Liquid B), if their surface tensions cannot meet eqns ( 12) and ( 14), the SLIS will be seriously damaged. 81,82 3.3.3 Exposure to UV and active species Exposing to UV is an extensive method to evaluate the chemical durability of liquid-repellent surfaces in the literature. Direct irradiation by UV lamp or sunlight is employed to conduct the evaluation of UV-resistance for liquid-repellent surfaces. 64,214,267,365 Testing parameters, such as wavelength and intensity of the UV light, exposure duration, and the distance between UV source and surface, are generally considered. If the matrix materials and/or surface functional groups of liquid-repellent surfaces are degradable towards UV, the surfaces will lose their liquid repellence after UV treatment. [366][367][368] For example, Kong et al. fabricated superoleophobic/superhydrophilic coatings on cotton fabric and sponge by liquid-phase deposition of TiO2 nanoparticles that were subsequently decorated with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). 367 Upon exposure to UV, TiO2 with ꞏOH radicals and holes (h + ) could oxidize the adsorbed PFOA long chains via defluorination cycle reaction, which finally turned the surface to be both superoleophilic and superhydrophilic. By contrast, Kim et al. prepared superhydrophobic coatings on various pre-roughened metals by depositing PDMS that was vaporized with the aid of ammonium bicarbonate. 369 Although the surfaces retained their superhydrophobicity after 5 days of UV irradiation, they became superhydrophilic upon treatment by UV-ozone, which might be attributed to the strong oxidation effect of ozone. Therefore, reactive gas can also cause chemical damage for liquid-repellent surfaces. Recently, a superamphiphobic surface composed of Ti-O-Ti networks, hydrophobic titanium-carboxylate coordination complexes, and fluorinate-rich molecular chains was reported to be partially damaged by NH3 exposure. 370 Due to the cleavage of a titanium-carboxylate coordination complex and the generation of ammonium carboxylate by NH3-triggered surface reactions, the polar component of the surface free energy (γs d ) decreased while the polar component (γs p ) increased, and the dipolar-dipolar interaction between water molecules and formed ammonium carboxylate was enhanced, driving the water droplets to quickly spread on the treated surface.When liquid-repellent surfaces make contact with organic solvents, potential physicochemical processes may occur, such as adsorption of the solvents, dissolution or swelling of the substrate and/or the surface coating, etc., making it necessary to test the durability of liquid repellence towards organic solvents. 332,353,364 For example, Wang et al. prepared a superamphiphobic surface on cotton fabric by dip-coating a mixed suspension of fluorodecyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes, TiO2 and PTFE particles, and showed that the water CA of the fabric decreased from 164° to 128° after being contaminated by oleic acid. 332 Cross-linked PDMS, which is typically used as a coating with low surface energy for superhydrophobic surface or a versatile matrix for SLIS, has been demonstrated to be unstable upon organic solvents (e.g., toluene, chloroform, and silicon oil) invasion. 227,276,277,323 In addition, for a SLIS with infused lubricant (Liquid A) and a testing organic solvent (Liquid B), if their surface tensions cannot meet eqns ( 12) and ( 14), the SLIS will be seriously damaged. 81,82 3.3.3 Exposure to UV and active species Exposing to UV is an extensive method to evaluate the chemical durability of liquid-repellent surfaces in the literature.

        <p>Additionally, polydopamine, a well-known substrate-independent adhesive that can attach to various materials through strong coordinative interactions, can also change the wettability of liquid-repellent surfaces due to the radicals generated during the oxidative polymerization of dopamine. 372,373 For example, Prieto-López et al. reported that when silicon-based SLISs prepared by swelling PDMS with silicon oil were placed in dopamine buffer solution containing NaOH, the surface hydrophobicity was changed and a polydopamine coating was observed on the damaged surface. 372 The authors found that the alkaline pH, the presence of Na + cations in the coating solution together with the active sites present in the polydopamine structure (i.e., -OH, =O, -NH, and -NH2), and especially various radical species generated during oxidative polymerization of dopamine, enabled the penetration of polydopamine particles through the lubricant layer, which further promoted the cleavage of the Si-O bond or C-H bond of the PDMS matrix and the subsequent anchoring of the dopamine/polydopamine species.Additionally, polydopamine, a well-known substrate-independent adhesive that can attach to various materials through strong coordinative interactions, can also change the wettability of liquid-repellent surfaces due to the radicals generated during the oxidative polymerization of dopamine. 372,373 For example, Prieto-López et al. reported that when silicon-based SLISs prepared by swelling PDMS with silicon oil were placed in dopamine buffer solution containing NaOH, the surface hydrophobicity was changed and a polydopamine coating was observed on the damaged surface. 372 The authors found that the alkaline pH, the presence of Na + cations in the coating solution together with the active sites present in the polydopamine structure (i.e., -OH, =O, -NH, and -NH2), and especially various radical species generated during oxidative polymerization of dopamine, enabled the penetration of polydopamine particles through the lubricant layer, which further promoted the cleavage of the Si-O bond or C-H bond of the PDMS matrix and the subsequent anchoring of the dopamine/polydopamine species.</p>

        <p>For example, Zhao et al. investigated the effect of volatility of infused lubricant oils towards the robustness of the SLIS. 385 For oils that were infused into hydrophobic nanostructured underlayers, such as pump oil (vapor pressure: 6.72 × 10 -6 kPa), silicone oil (0.7 kPa) and perfluoropolyether (Krytox GPL105, ~ 10 -8 kPa), they were of low volatility. When slippery surfaces infused with these lubricants were exposed to evaporation at temperature of 75 °C for 7 days (Fig. 24c) and continuous water-flow shear for 600 minutes (Fig. 24d), these surfaces still exhibited remarkable liquid repellence. Conversely, after hydrophobic porous layers were filled with high-volatility oils, such as petroleum ether (7.99 kPa), cyclohexane (10.31 kPa), and toluene (2.9 kPa), lubricants were prone to be evaporated from the SLIS in a short time even at room temperature. Finally, these slippery surfaces were transformed into hydrophobic surfaces, showing unstable performance of oils retention. Ouyang et al. discussed the effects of dimethyl silicone oils with different viscosities towards anti-corrosion and anti-biofouling performances. 387 High-viscosity dimethyl silicone oils (viscosity: 350 mPaꞏs) were demonstrated to possess better corrosion and biofouling inhibition performance than that of low-viscosity oils (50100 mPaꞏs) for a long term. Sett et al. prepared a robust nanostructured fluorinated SLIS for vapor condensation of ethanol and hexane. 386 They demonstrated that low-viscosity oils (Krytox GPL 100, 23 mPaꞏs) were quickly depleted from the slippery surfaces during steam condensation and high-viscosity lubricants (Krytox 1525, 496 mPaꞏs) were stable and durable for 7 h (Fig. 24e).

Subsequently, in the freezing condition, the solid peanut oils in PTSLIS were well retained in porous PDMS substrates while liquid oils in SLIS were easily drained from the pores by capillary force from nucleation of icicle. In addition, phase transformable lubricants were capable of self-healing bulk damage. At a temperature of above 3 °C, liquid-phrase lubricants could spontaneously flow to the damage regions to form a homogenous lubricant layer via surface-energy-driven-capillary forces.

At a temperature of above 3 °C, liquid-phrase lubricants could spontaneously flow to the damage regions to form a homogenous lubricant layer via surface-energy-driven-capillary forces. At freezing temperature, liquid-phrase oil was converted into solid-phrase oil, which possessed greater intermolecular force and was beneficial for self-repair of damaged areas.</p>

        <p>As discussed above, superhydrophobicity and superoleophobicity in air relies on the retained air pockets, superoleophobicity underwater originates from the locked water layer, and the liquid repellence of SLIS depends on the infused lubricant layer. Consequently, the stability of these micro/nano structure enabled "cushion" determines the thermodynamic durability of the liquid-repellent surfaces, which further influences the chemical durability of these surfaces in terms of immersing in corrosive liquids or exposing to corrosive vapors.

        <p>Recently, Hu et al. designed new super liquid-repellent surfaces with re-entrant heads atop spring-like flexible supports by 3D direct laser writing lithography (Fig. 25a), and trampoline-inspired extra horizontal springs to link adjacent mushroom-like heads was further proposed to resolve the structural instability owing to stress concentration and large aspect ratio (Fig. 25b). 211 In contrast to the re-entrant heads with rigid supports, the spring-like flexible supports were proved to contribute a 15.60% improvement of droplet impalement resistance, and even reached a 50.98% enhancement with the aid of trampoline-inspired horizontal springs. Recently, the authors further demonstrated that the mushroom-like units with spring-like supports showed mechanical robustness against normal and shear compress (Fig. 25c), as well as tribological friction. 47 Although singly re-entrant structures increased the breakthrough pressure of liquids, and thus improved the stability of the air cushion, it was subsequently demonstrated that doubly or even triply re-entrant structures could further minimize the break-in force by the liquid pressure and maximize the surface tension force that favored the beading up of the liquid. 185,188 For example, Domingues et al. studied the stability of entrapped air on coating-free Si/SiO2 surfaces with different micro-textures, including simple cavity, re-entrant cavity and doubly re-entrant cavity (Fig. 26a), under wetting liquids. 390 Results showed that the breakthrough pressures of intruding water on simple cavities were 0 kPa, while those on (doubly) re-entrant cavities were typically larger than 100 kPa. In addition, while the air entrapped in circular or non-circular simple cavities immersed in hexadecane was lost within 0.2 s, the air entrapped in various (doubly) re-entrant cavities showed much better stability, and the circular (doubly) re-entrant cavities even stabilized the intruding menisci such that the trapped air remained completely intact even after 27 days (Fig. 26b). Recently, it was demonstrated that a surface with nanoscale doubly re-entrant structures could repel impacting water droplets with a Weber number as high as 10 3 at room temperature due to its extremely high breakthrough pressure. 288 Sun et al. designed robust super liquid-repellent surfaces by depositing hydrophobized silica nanoparticles onto multilayered doubly re-entrant micro structures (Fig. 26c) that could generate stepwise wetting resistance. 391 Three layers of doubly re-entrant posts with increasing diameter from top to bottom provided multiple energy barriers for intrusive liquid due to stepwise sagging of the liquid-air interface.

This endowed the engineered surfaces with durable super liquid repellence against droplet evaporation, dynamic impact by ethylene glycol droplets with Weber number of 35, and random vibration underwater. Furthermore, Liu et al. prepared triply re-entrant microstructures by adding a small overhang at the bottom of the inner vertical overhang doubly re-entrant microstructure via two-photon polymerization-based 3D printing (Fig. 27a-c), and demonstrated that the triply re-entrant structures showed higher breakthrough pressure in comparisons with traditional microscale pillars, singly re-entrant structures, and doubly re-entrant structures (Fig. 27d). 188 The printed surface possessed super-repellence to water and various organic liquids with surface tensions of 12.0-27.1 mN m -1 , which could even be retained after oxygen plasma treatment. experimentally demonstrated that the micro and nanoscale structures of hierarchical superhydrophobic surfaces played distinct, but complementary, roles in endowing the surface with durable water repellence under droplet impacting. 398 The nanostructures provided a large anti-wetting capillary pressure, while the micro features hindered the development and propagation of pressures due to liquid compression. Verho et al. studied pressure-induced wetting states transition of superhydrophobic surfaces with one-tier (i.e., microscale) and two-tier (i.e., micro-nano hierarchical) topographies. 399 Results showed that positive Laplace pressure caused an irreversible transition from the Cassie to the Wenzel wetting state for the superhydrophobic surface with single-level topography (Fig. 29a). However, the nanostructures on the surface with hierarchical textures effectively suppressed the transition to the Wenzel state and instead to a so-called nano-Cassie state due to the trapped air in the nanostructures, demonstrating reversible and durable Cassie state superhydrophobicity (Fig. 29b). Similar work was reported by Li et al., who demonstrated a so-called monostable superhydrophobic surface with hierarchical textures, where the transitions from the Cassie state to the Wenzel state became spontaneously reversible. 284 By considering nanotextures enhanced durability, Mouterde et al. proposed structural recipes of superhydrophobic surface for repelling hot water: rough features with small radial size (e.g., radius of top, ~ 100 nm) and relatively large axial dimensions (e.g., height of ~ 10 μm). 295 The nanometric top limited the size of vapor-condensation-induced water bridges and thus miniaturized the droplet sticking, while the tall features dynamically prevented the formation of water bridges between the hot droplets and the solid surface during contact. For underwater superolephobic surface and SLIS, nano structures stabilize the water or lubricant layer via superior capillary forces. 245,322 Kim et al. discussed the performance of retaining oils on four types of lubricant-infused substrates, such as flat, microtextured, nanostructured and hierarchically structured substrates, and demonstrated that the substrates with nanotextures possessed the best ability of oil retention (Fig. 30a). 257 Microtextured, nanostructured and hierarchically structured roughness on aluminum substrates were synthesized after sandblasting, boehmite and both of sandblasting and boehmite, respectively. For flat substrates, it was difficult to hold lubricants due to a lack of capillary force when exposed to practical conditions (Fig. 30a,i). On microtextured substrates, lubricants easily leaked from valleys between the microscale structures when the length scale of the microtextured features was larger than the capillary length of the lubricant (Fig. 30a, ii). In terms of hierarchically structured substrates consisting of nanostructured and micro-structured textures, nanoscale roughness provided a large capillary force to retain lubricants, but there was still the loss of lubricant from valleys of microscale topographies (Fig. 30a, iii). Lubricants were stabilized in SLIS with nanostructures when the thickness of the lubricant layer matched well with the height of nanostructured textures (Fig. 30a, iv). Therefore, Vogel et al. designed well-ordered honeycomb wall nanostructures in which lubricants could be strongly locked and flow freely, even when exposed to strong shear forces or long-term storage. 338 The SLISs were prepared as follows: a homogeneous and interconnected porous layer was synthesized by using a silica precursor solution to backfill colloidal monolayer on a glass substrate and then the colloids were removed at high temperature, which was followed by infusing the porous intermediate with fluorinated oil. When the SLIS was damaged partly (damaged region was 33%), it retained outstanding octane repellent property with a SA of &lt; 5° under spin-coating at 10000 r.p.m. This could be attributed to the interconnected nanoscale pore structures that favored the formation of intact surface via re-filling of the lubricant. The as-prepared SLIS retained remarkable octane repellency with SAs of below 10° after being stored more than 9 months without replenishment of the lubricants. In addition, SEM images shown in Fig. 30b demonstrated complete structural integrity of the closed-cell architectures after various mechanical testing including tape peeling, touching, and wiping, while the open-cell samples were completely destroyed by any of the testing (Fig. 30b, insets). These results demonstrated the excellent robustness and durability of the SLIS with closed-cell nanopores array, the coated glass slides showed efficient repellency to dyed octane droplet after mechanical wiping, scratching with a razor blade and sandpaper (Fig. 30c). Furthermore, Laney et al. reported delayed lubricant depletion of SLIS with nanotube texture in comparison to nanohole and nanopillar textures (Fig. 30d). 401 The authors fabricated an array of silicon nanotubes and equivalent arrays of nanoholes and nanopillars (pitch, 560 nm; height, 2 μm), and obtained the corresponding SLISs after surface hydrophobic treatment and subsequent infusion with lubricant Krytox 1525.

The results demonstrated that due to the strong interaction between the infused lubricant and underlying nanostructures, water droplets deposited on nanostructured SLIS preferred a molecular orientation that was predominantly parallel to the water-lubricant interface (Fig. 30e), which weakened the hydrogen bonding interactions between the water droplets and lubricant, imparting the SLIS with excellent water repellence and reduction of lubricant depletion during contact with water.Recently, Zhang et al. proposed a new mechanism of nanostructures enhanced lubricant retention for SLIS during its contact with water. 402 By using surface-sensitive sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy, the authors characterised the water-lubricant interface of a water droplet depositing on a lubricant-infused nanostructured surface and the same lubricant layer without the underlying nanostructures.

        <p>Rough topographies are almost indispensable to achieve liquid-repellent surfaces. As discussed above, nanoscale structures can enhance the liquid repellence via special capillarity, but these structures are intrinsically extremely fragile towards mechanical force and can be easily destroyed even by rather low mechanical stress. By contrast, microscale features possess much higher resistance to external forces induced destruction. However, owing to the considerable contact line pinning at the edges of the microstructures, liquid-repellent surfaces with microstructures alone always exhibit large CAH and low liquid mobility. Therefore, hierarchical structures, combination of micro and nano structures, have been widely employed to improve the mechanical robustness of liquid-repellent surfaces. 42,50,375,414 When hierarchical structures are exposed to mechanical stress, the microstructures bear much of the loading, which thereby protects the fragile nanostructures from being damaged. For example, Zimmermann et al.Rough topographies are almost indispensable to achieve liquid-repellent surfaces. As discussed above, nanoscale structures can enhance the liquid repellence via special capillarity, but these structures are intrinsically extremely fragile towards mechanical force and can be easily destroyed even by rather low mechanical stress. By contrast, microscale features possess much higher resistance to external forces induced destruction.

        <p>reported a gas phase coating procedure to deposit a polymethylsilsesquioxane nanofilaments layer on various textile fabrics, by which robust superhydrophobicity was created. 152 As illustrated in Fig. 32a, a superhydrophobic poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fabric retained its water repellent property after 1450 cycles skin-simulating abrasion under a contact pressure of 7.8 kPa, and it could be easily seen that the 3D microstructure of the fabric protected the majority of the nanofilaments from being damaged during abrasion (Fig. 32b). Xiu et al. compared the mechanical robustness of several superhydrophobic surfaces, including hierarchically structured silicon, nanostructured polyurethane, PTFE, silica and silicon. 50 After abrasion by polyester/cellulose Technicloth II wipes (pressure of 3.45 KPa and abrasion length of 25 cm), the superhydrophobic silicon surface with two-scale micro-and nano-structures showed robust water repellence with nearly constant water CA (&gt; 165°) and small CAH increase (from 2° to 13.6°), while all other surfaces lost their superhydrophobicity (water CA &lt; 140° and CAH &gt; 60°). Surface morphology characterisation showed that the nanostructures alone were easy to damage, as well as those on the tops of the micro pyramids, but the nanostructures close to the base of the micro pyramids were well protected and retained, which largely improved the robustness of water repellence towards mechanical abrasion. Verho et al. proposed a model to explain the hierarchical architectures induced mechanical robustness of super liquid repellence, as shown in Fig. 32c. 415 If the surface was composed of one-tier structures (either micro or nano scale), abrasion caused the structures to wear off, leading to a rupture of the Cassie-Baxter wetting state.

        <p>Based on this, they proposed a concept of discrete or partial superhydrophobicity, indicating that although the protective structures were partially damaged and lost the water repellence due to physical abrasion, the protected areas were well preserved and thereby retained the overall superhydrophobicity of the surface. Recently, Qing et al. proposed a microskeleton-nanofiller composite to form an excellent mechanically robust superhydrophobic film against abrasion and impact. 335 They filled phosphorizing liquid roughened porous iron with inorganic/organic medium composed of fluorinated epoxy resin, hydrophobic SiO2 nanoparticles and γ-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, and the resultant composite film showed superhydrophobicity (Fig. 33d). Due to the protectiveness of the microskeleton, the nanofiller could be well retained during knife scratch, cyclic tape peeling, and continuous sandpaper/Taber abrasion (Fig. 33e and f), thereby reserving superhydrophobicity before complete wearing of the film. Additionally, the tight composite filler protected the microskeleton from being collapsed during bearing ball impacting (Fig. 33g), which enabled robustness to heavy impact at least up to a kinetic energy of ~ 40.2 J.Based on this, they proposed a concept of discrete or partial superhydrophobicity, indicating that although the protective structures were partially damaged and lost the water repellence due to physical abrasion, the protected areas were well preserved and thereby retained the overall superhydrophobicity of the surface.

        <p>Wang et al. further demonstrated that when the liquid-solid contact fraction (f1) is small enough, the surface could still repel water even if the contact areas were altered from hydrophobic to hydrophilic during mechanical abrasion (Fig. 34a). 44 Based on this, they reported a mechanically robust water-repellent surface with skillfully designed "armoured" micro/nano structures. They deposited nanoparticles into interconnected microstructures that contained crater-like "pockets", and the nanostructures were used to provide water repellency while the microstructures were designed to protect the mechanically fragile nanoparticles (Fig. 34b). Benefiting from the protection of mechanically robust microstructure armour, the housed superhydrophobic nanoparticles could be well preserved during abrasion, which endowed the surface to be water-repellent before f1 increased to a critical value upon abrasion (Fig. 34c). For example, they fabricated inverted-pyramidal microstructures on silicon substrates with different open cavity widths L and liquid-solid contact fractions f1, and then filled the microstructure frameworks with soot-templated silica nanostructures, finally yielding water-repellent surfaces after fluoridation. Repeated scraping by steel blade gradually removed materials (both the fluorosilane layer and the matrix) from the top of the microstructures (Fig. 34d), which changed the local wetting properties of the surface from hydrophobic (θY = 115°) to hydrophilic (θY = 45°) and increased the liquid-solid contact fraction f1, but the surfaces retained their super water repellence after abrasion if f1 was lower than 8% (Fig. 34e andf). Linear abrasion testing (vertical pressure of 12 MPa and abrasion speed of 50 mm s -1 ) of the armoured superhydrophobic surfaces showed that more than 1000 cycles of abrasion could be tolerated, which was 10 times higher than that of conventional superhydrophobic surfaces (Fig. 34g). The remarkable mechanical robustness of the armoured water-repellent surfaces was also confirmed by other testing, including scratching, tape-peeling, Taber abrasion and high-speed water jet impacting.Wang et al. further demonstrated that when the liquid-solid contact fraction (f1) is small enough, the surface could still repel water even if the contact areas were altered from hydrophobic to hydrophilic during mechanical abrasion (Fig. 34a). 44 Based on this, they reported a mechanically robust water-repellent surface with skillfully designed "armoured" micro/nano structures.

        <p>In general, covalent bonds can be generated between substrates and coatings via reactions of chemical reactive groups. Surfaces with abundant hydroxyl groups (e.g., cellulose-based fabrics, filter paper, etc.) can directly react with silanol, epoxide groups, etc. to form covalent bonds. Deng et al. soaked a cotton fabric into a methanol solution containing 1H,1H,2H,2H-nonafluorohexyl-1-acrylate monomer and then initiated graft polymerization under γ-rays irradiation in a nitrogen atmosphere, which resulted in covalent connection of fluorinated compounds onto the cotton fiber at the molecular level. 358 When the degree of grafting was higher than 10%, the obtained fabric showed stable superhydrophobicity. Due to the strong binding between the cotton fiber and the fluorinated groups, the grafted fabric retained its superhydrophobicity after 50 accelerated laundering cycles, which was equivalent to 250 commercial or domestic launderings. Zou et al. prepared a highly durable and robust superhydrophobic cotton fabrics based on covalent bonding by using diblock copolymers consisting of poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PGMA) and poly(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl methacrylate) (PTFEMA) blocks. 417 The block copolymers self-assembled into micellar aggregates to form nanoscale roughness, and the PTFEMA block lowered the surface free energy, while the PGMA block was covalently bonded to the surfaces of cotton fibers through a ring-opening reaction between the epoxy groups of the PGMA chains and the hydroxyl groups of the cotton fiber, and the self-crosslinking of the epoxy groups from PGMA chains. The covalently bonded PTFEMA chains favored the robustness and durability of the superhydrophobic fabrics towards various testing, including sandpaper abrasion, laundering, ultrasonication and boiling in tetrahydrofuran or trifluorotoluene, soaking in organic solvents and acidic/basic aqueous solutions, and exposure to UV irradiation. Fang et al. modified fabric with mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane to incorporate thiol groups, which was then used to anchor methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane modified SiO2@Fe3O4 (MPS-SiO2@Fe3O4) nanoparticles via UV-assisted thiol-ene click chemistry (Fig. 35a). 418 The obtained superhydrophobic fabric showed excellent robustness against tape-peeling, sandpaper abrasion, and corrosive solutions, which were attributed to the strong interactions between the MPS-SiO2@Fe3O4 nanoparticles and fabric by thiol-ene click reaction-induced covalent bonding. For those surfaces with insufficient reactive groups (e.g., glass), pre-treatments by UV, ozone, plasma, or chemical solutions are required. For example, Zhang et al. reported a method to prepare robust superhydrophobic coatings via stoichiometric silanization (Fig. 35b-d). 381 The authors mixed pure octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) with water by vortex and sonication, which was then incubated for 2 h under ambient conditions before being diluted with hexane. The solution could be used to treat various substrates directly to obtain superhydrophobic surfaces, such as cotton fabric, filter paper, and PET, but pretreatment by UV-ozone cleaner was required for glass slides (Fig. 35b). During the solution preparation procedure, stoichiometric silanization reaction between long-chain organosilanes and water occurred and created micro-and nano-scale hierarchical siloxane aggregates (Fig. 35c). Owing to the incomplete silanization reaction after 2 h, reactive sites (-Si-OH or -Si-Cl) still existed on the aggregated particles, which facilitated the formation of covalent bonding between these hierarchical particles and the substrates covered with -OH groups during the coating treatment. The covalently bonded coating showed robust superhydrophobicity towards falling sand abrasion, water jetting, water splashing and tissue wiping, etc. (Fig. 35d). Additionally, the coating could tolerate abrasion by sandpaper under a pressure of 2.5 kPa and a distance of 50 cm, since only the top layer of the coating was partially removed while the remaining micro/nano structures were similarly rough to retain the super water repellence.In general, covalent bonds can be generated between substrates and coatings via reactions of chemical reactive groups.

        <p>In addition to directly forming covalent bonds, cross-linking has also been introduced to increase the bonding density, which can further improve the bonding strength between liquid-repellent coatings and substrates. Cross-linking reactions can be triggered by adding cross-linking agents/catalysts, exposing to UV/plasma, etc. For example, Ye et al. synthesized 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane functionalized hydrophobic SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) first, and then incorporated hexamethylene diisocyanate tripolymer (N3375) as a cross-linking agent into their mixture with hydroxyl acrylic resin, which was finally sprayed onto a glass slide and cured to prepare a superhydrophobic surface. 420 Owing to the formed cross-linked network structure (Fig. 37a), the resultant superhydrophobic surface could retain its water repellence after 30 cycles of sandpaper abrasion and 240 h of immersion in acid solution (pH = 1). Li et al. reported a method to prepare robust superhydrophobic surface by rapid UV cross-linking of superhydrophobic PDMS/SiO2 coating onto a stretchable polyurethane acrylate (PUA) substrate. 421 As shown in Fig. 37b, pre-polymer of PUA was cured via UV irradiation to form stretchable matrix, while its surface remained uncured due to the oxygen inhibition when exposed to air during the photopolymerization. The uncured PUA surface provided abundant reactive sites for cross-linking of the sprayed superhydrophobic PDMS/SiO2 coating under UV irradiation. The formed covalent cross-linking greatly enhanced the interface adhesion between the coating and substrate, which obviously improved the mechanical robustness of the resultant superhydrophobic surface towards sandpaper abrasion and stretching-releasing. The authors firstly dipped cotton fabric into homogeneous mixture of spherical SiO2 particles with different diameters (100, 200 and 400 nm), and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) in ethanol for 10 min. After drying at room temperature, the fabric was immersed into the mixture of PDMS prepolymer and its curing agent (mass ratio of 10:1) and 3-isocyanatomethyl-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexyl isocyanate (IPDI) in n-hexane for 2 min, and then obtained the superhydrophobic cotton after curing at 120 °C for 2 h. The surfaces of the SiO2 particles and cotton fabric were rich in -OH groups, enabling them to be easily cross-linked together via the assistance of the silane coupling agent. During the first dip-coating, the -OH groups generated by the hydrolysis of the C2H5O-groups of APTES acted as the linkage point and the -OH groups on the surface of SiO2 particles were firstly bonded to the -OH groups of the silanol surface and then connected to the -OH groups of the cotton surface.

        <p>reported robust superhydrophobic surfaces that were prepared by forming Ag nanoparticles (NPs) coated with the copolymer (polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene-co-butylene)-block-polystyrene: SEBS) via Ag precursor reduction and synchronous nonsolvent induced phase separation (Fig. 38b). 359 The SEBS significantly strengthened the interaction among individual Ag NPs and the bonding between Ag NPs and the substrate, thereby making the superhydrophobic surfaces robust against ultrasonic treatment, bending, and sandpaper abrasion. Later, SEBS was used to enhance the bonding between dimethyloctadecyl Lu et al. first proposed to promote the mechanical robustness of superhydrophobic coatings by commercial adhesive enhanced bonding between the coatings and substrates. 51 A paint-like ethanolic suspension of perfluorosilane-coated TiO2 nanoparticles was prepared and then sprayed, dipped, or extruded onto both hard and soft materials (e.g., glass, steel, cotton wool, and filter paper) to create superhydrophobic surfaces (Fig. 39a, for example). The authors developed a method to enhance the bonding strength between the coatings and substrates by using commercial adhesives (e.g., double-sided tape, spray adhesive), from which the weak inherent robustness of the superhydrophobic coatings was significantly overcome. The "paint + adhesive + substrate" strategy enabled the resultant superhydrophobic surfaces to retain their water repellency after finger wiping, knife scratching, and 40 abrasion cycles with sandpaper (Fig. 39b). Enlightened by this work, commercial adhesive or glue have been frequently used to construct robust and durable liquid-repellent surfaces. 428,429 For example, Chen et al. prepared mechanically robust superamphiphobic surfaces by bonding perfluorooctanoic acid modified copper particles onto various substrates (e.g., glass, aluminum, rubber, scouring pad, filter paper and sponge) with double-sided tape or commercial spray adhesive. 214 Intensive falling sand abrasion (150 g of sand impacted on the coating from the height up to 70 cm) had little influence on the superamphiphobicity of the as-prepared surfaces, and a coated rubber could even retain both water and oil repellency after 50 stretch/release cycles. Besides the above-mentioned organic adhesives, inorganic adhesives have also been employed to enhance the bonding strength between liquid-repellent coatings and substrates.

        <p>developed robust underwater superoleophobic surfaces by spraying a composite suspension of nanoparticles and aluminum phosphate (AP) binder. 240 The spraying solution was prepared by mixing AP with nanoparticles in ethanol/water cosolvent. During heating-assisted curing process, the hydroxy groups of the AP binder favored condensation-polymerization reaction via intermolecular and intramolecular dehydration to form continuous network structures, and the hydrogen (or coordination) bonds between the functional groups of the AP binder and oxygen (or metal) atoms on the surfaces of the substrates created strong molecular attractive forces to increase the adhesion (Fig. 39c). This strategy was available for various nanoparticles (such as TiO2, SiO2, and Al2O3) and substrates (SSM, ceramic, and glass) to construct robust underwater oil-repellent surfaces. As shown in Fig. 39d, after 500 abrasion cycles by sandpaper, the underwater oil CAs of the TiO2-AP-treated SSM retained above 150° and the mass loss of the TiO2-AP coating was only ~ 20%. Sun et al. prepared a superamphiphobic coating by spray-coating of the suspension containing PFDTS-modified SiO2 nanoparticles and AP.

        <p>When liquid-repellent surfaces are damaged mechanically or chemically, healing the surface chemistry may restore the lost liquid-repellence provided that the surface textures are adequate, which is inspired by those natural plants like Lotus leaves that can release new wax film to recover the damaged liquid repellence. 433 Subsequently, endowing liquid-repellent surfaces with self-healable chemistry that mainly depends on surface reorganization or chemical agents releasing is popular to improve both their mechanical robustness and chemical durability. 216,310,434,435 In addition, this thermodynamically-driven process occurs spontaneously under most conditions and can be accelerated by heating, increasing air humidity, etc. 310 As illustrated in Fig. 42a 436 Upon exposure to oxygen plasma, the deposited POTS layer was etched away and oxygen-containing hydrophilic groups were generated on the coating surface, leading the coating to be superhydrophilic. The interfacial surface energy difference between the plasma treated surface and the surrounding air would drive the covalently bonded hydrophobic POTS molecules underneath the treated area to migrate to the outer surface through rearrangement of polyelectrolyte chains, which enabled the coating to restore its superhydrophobicity after aging for only 4 h under a relative humidity of 40%. Later, Jin et al. reported robust superamphiphobic silica aerogels that could retain their liquid repellence after 100 mechanical abrasion cycles, which was attributed to the combined effect of the self-similar re-entrant topography of the silica aerogels and the self-healing of the fluorinated surfactant (Fig. 42b). 411 Liu et al. reported a mechanical stimuli induced self-healing of chemically damaged superhydrophobicity. 437 They prepared superhydrophobic textiles by coating polydopamine nanocapsules that were filled with hydrophobic agents such as octadecylamine and octadecanethiol. These trapped hydrophobic agents could be released under mechanical stimuli (e.g., stretching, compression, friction, and even mechanical washing), which favored the self-healing of the superhydrophobicity when it was damaged by plasma treatment (Fig. 42c). Compared with superhydrophobic and superoleophobic surfaces, SLISs are naturally self-healable due to the mobility of the infused lubricant. 20 However, lubricants are easily depleted or removed under some conditions like continuous water flow impacting or evaporation, even if the surface structures of the SLIS are well-designed. 271 In order to further improve the longevity and durability of SLIS, incorporating self-replenishable lubricant by using internal oil reservoirs could be a good choice. 438 Once lubricant layers are damaged, oils can continuously migrate from internal oil reservoirs to refill the damaged regions, and thus the self-healing function of SLIS is realized. For example, Liu et al. prepared robust and self-replenishing slippery lubricant-infused porous network surface (SLIPNS) for anti-icing applications. 53 The key structures of the SLIPNS were the microchannels and nanosheets, which worked as internal oil reservoirs and vessels, respectively. As a comparison, SLIS with only nanosheets was also synthesized. During multiple icing/de-icing cycles, it was found that more lubricant retained on the SLIPNS, which exhibited more stable performance than the SLIS. When oil depletion occurred on SLIS, only the interfacial lubricant film flowed into the damaged areas (Fig. 43a). By contrast, in terms of the SLIPNS, the lost oil could be supplemented by both top oil layer and interconnected microchannels (Fig. 43b). Similarly, owing to the self-healable lubricant layer, the water repellence of the SLIPNS retained almost unchanged after knife scratch, repeated icing/de-icing, and water flow impact. Yu et al. fabricated robust and self-healing SLIS by using modified hollow silica spheres as oil reservoirs via a spray-coating method. 267 The modified mesoporous silica particles were synthesized after vinyl-terminated PDMS was grafted on the external and internal sulfhydryl-modified hollow spheres via a thiol-ene click reaction.When liquid-repellent surfaces are damaged mechanically or chemically, healing the surface chemistry may restore the lost liquid-repellence provided that the surface textures are adequate, which is inspired by those natural plants like Lotus leaves that can release new wax film to recover the damaged liquid repellence. 433 Subsequently, endowing liquid-repellent surfaces with self-healable chemistry that mainly depends on surface reorganization or chemical agents releasing is popular to improve both their mechanical robustness and chemical durability. 216,310,434,435 In addition, this thermodynamically-driven process occurs spontaneously under most conditions and can be accelerated by heating, increasing air humidity, etc. 310 As illustrated in Fig. 42a 436 Upon exposure to oxygen plasma, the deposited POTS layer was etched away and oxygen-containing hydrophilic groups were generated on the coating surface, leading the coating to be superhydrophilic.

        <p>The surface morphologies of liquid-repellent surfaces can be changed under the action of mechanical force and chemical media, which lead to the loss of liquid repellence of different degrees. When the surface textures of liquid-repellent surfaces are distorted but not removed from the underlying substrates by external force, strategies like using elastic materials and shape memory polymers (SMPs) can be used to recover the textures, and thereby restores the liquid repellence. Elastic materials can deform actively when mechanical forces are applied on (e.g., bending, twisting, compressing, and stretching), which avoids the fracture and removal of micro/nano structures; once the forces are withdrawn, the materials recover their original surface morphologies owing to the reversible deformation. Therefore, endowing the liquid-repellent coating and/or the underneath substrate with elasticity becomes a general method to improve their mechanical robustness. 55,149,193,356,440 As shown in Fig. 44a, when a hydrophobic TiO2 nanoparticles coated elastic VHB 4910 film was equi-biaxially stretched with stretch ratio λ = 3, the micro/nanostructured TiO2 clusters were diluted and the film thereby lost its superhydrophobicity, which could be easily recovered by releasing the film (λ = 1) due to its excellent elasticity. 149 Dai et al.The surface morphologies of liquid-repellent surfaces can be changed under the action of mechanical force and chemical media, which lead to the loss of liquid repellence of different degrees.

        <p>reported thermo-induced self-healing of superhydrophobic coating prepared by using self-assembled flaky micro/nano structures of cellulose-derived phase-change nanocrystals. 446 The authors firstly hydrolyzed microcrystalline cellulose by using hydrochloric acid to extract cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), which were then modified with 10-undecenoylchloride in pyridine under heterogeneous reaction conditions to synthesize undecenoated cellulose nanocrystals (UCNCs), and then 1-octadecanethiol was grafted in the shell layer of the UCNCs containing terminal vinyl groups via thiol-ene reaction to prepare 1-octadecanethiolated UCNCs (C18-UCNCs) (Fig. 45a). The C18-UCNCs possessed a distinct core-shell structure: the cellulose crystalline core retained the basic structure and the soft shell containing octadecyl chains allowed phase transition. During the evaporation from its tetrahydrofuran suspension, the phase transition of the C18-UCNCs shell led to the formation of self-assembled flaky micro/nano structures with superhydrophobicity (Fig. 45b), by which both self-standing C18-UCNCs films and coatings on other substrates with super water repellence could be obtained. The assembled flaky hierarchical structures showed limited mechanical robustness towards abrasion by 800 mesh sandpaper under loading of 50 g and an abrasion length of 20 cm, and the damaged structures decreased the water CA of the self-standing film from ~ 160° to ~ 115° (Fig. 45c). After heating the damaged films at 80 °C for 30 min, cooling down, and aging at room temperature for 24 h, the flaky hierarchical structures regenerated and the films restored their superhydrophobicity (Fig. 45d), and the abrasion-healing process could be repeated for more than 10 cycles.reported thermo-induced self-healing of superhydrophobic coating prepared by using self-assembled flaky micro/nano structures of cellulose-derived phase-change nanocrystals. 446 The authors firstly hydrolyzed microcrystalline cellulose by using hydrochloric acid to extract cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), which were then modified with 10-undecenoylchloride in pyridine under heterogeneous reaction conditions to synthesize undecenoated cellulose nanocrystals (UCNCs), and then 1-octadecanethiol was grafted in the shell layer of the UCNCs containing terminal vinyl groups via thiol-ene reaction to prepare 1-octadecanethiolated UCNCs (C18-UCNCs) (Fig. 45a). The C18-UCNCs possessed a distinct core-shell structure: the cellulose crystalline core retained the basic structure and the soft shell containing octadecyl chains allowed phase transition.

        <p>Moreover, in terms of macroscopic ruptures (e.g., by knife cutting) on liquid-repellent materials, the reforming effect of coordination bonds could be a useful method to heal the cracks and subsequently the liquid repellence. 195,447,448 For example, Jin et al. prepared a self-healing SLIS via cross-linking of dopamine-armed Fe3O4 nanoparticles, diethylenetriamine, and glycidyl methacrylate-co-polydimethylsiloxane propyl ether methacrylate, and subsequent silicone oil swelling. 449 As depicted in Fig. 46a, owing to the photothermal effect of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, reversible Fe-catechol coordination, and reconfigurable lubricant layer, the cracked SLIS could be recovered after being irradiated with sunlamp for 2 h and sequentially healed for 10 h under ambient conditions (Fig. 46b).Moreover, in terms of macroscopic ruptures (e.g., by knife cutting) on liquid-repellent materials, the reforming effect of coordination bonds could be a useful method to heal the cracks and subsequently the liquid repellence. 195,447,448 For example, Jin et al. prepared a self-healing SLIS via cross-linking of dopamine-armed Fe3O4 nanoparticles, diethylenetriamine, and glycidyl methacrylate-co-polydimethylsiloxane propyl ether methacrylate, and subsequent silicone oil swelling. 449 As depicted in Fig. 46a, owing to the photothermal effect of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, reversible Fe-catechol coordination, and reconfigurable lubricant layer, the cracked SLIS could be recovered after being irradiated with sunlamp for 2 h and sequentially healed for 10 h under ambient conditions (Fig. 46b).</p>
        <p>Shan et al. prepared a self-healing superhydrophobic surface by spraying polystyrene (PS) and SiO2 particles on a layer of cross-linked PDMS-based silicon elastomer containing imidazole-zinc coordination bonds. 448 The imidazole group had strong coordination ability towards metal ions (e.g., Zn 2+ ), and the pendant structure imparted the imidazole group and PDMS chains with high mobility, which enabled the coating to recover its topographic structures and thus super water repellence within 20 min at room temperature when it was damaged by knife-induced ruptures (Fig. 46c).Shan et al. prepared a self-healing superhydrophobic surface by spraying polystyrene (PS) and SiO2 particles on a layer of cross-linked PDMS-based silicon elastomer containing imidazole-zinc coordination bonds. 448 The imidazole group had strong coordination ability towards metal ions (e.g., Zn 2+ ), and the pendant structure imparted the imidazole group and PDMS chains with high mobility, which enabled the coating to recover its topographic structures and thus super water repellence within 20 min at room temperature when it was damaged by knife-induced ruptures (Fig. 46c).</p>
        <p>Based on the above two aspects, liquid-repellent surfaces with both self-healable surface chemistry and restorable microstructure have also been developed to address their robustness and durability. [450][451][452] For example, Pan et al. reported a self-healable superhydrophobic surface that composed of SMP micropillars decorated by pH-responsive capsules encapsulated with fluoroalkylsilane (Fig. 47). 452 As shown in Fig. 47a, they firstly prepared pH-responsive dodecafluoroheptyl-propyl-trimethoxysilane (FAS12, C13H18F12O3Si) encapsulated microcapsules by polymerizing milky emulsion containing 2-(diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DEAEMA), 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate (HDDA), benzoin isobutyl ether (BIE), FAS12 and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) under UV exposure. Then the microcapsules decorated epoxy-based SMP micropillars were fabricated via mold replication method, which showed super water repellence with water CA of 153° and SA of 7°. Owing to the shape memory effect of the micropillar and the encapsulated agent of FAS12, the prepared superhydrophobic surface could not only restore the crushed surface textures by heat, but also heal the damaged surface chemistry under the assistance of acid stimuli (Fig. 47b). Recently, Yu et al. prepared a robust and durable slippery film with lubricant self-replenishing and morphology self-healing properties by encapsulating silicone oil into thermoplastic elastomers. 453 As shown in Fig. 48a, polysiloxane-polyurea elastomer composite silicone oil (PDMS-IPDI@Oil) was firstly synthesized by a polycondensation reaction between aminopropyl-terminated polydimethylsiloxane (NH2-PDMS-NH2) and isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) in tetrahydrofuran solution containing silicone oil.Based on the above two aspects, liquid-repellent surfaces with both self-healable surface chemistry and restorable microstructure have also been developed to address their robustness and durability.

        <p>Then, the terminal -NH2 groups of the PDMS-IPDI@Oil further reacted with the -CHO groups of the chain extender terephthalic aldehyde (TPAL) to yield PDMS-IPDI@Oil with dynamic imine bond (named as PDMS-IPDI-TPAL@Oil). Due to the reversible cleavage and reconstruction of the imine and hydrogen bonds, the damaged crack could be restored via bonds recombination (Fig. 48b). In addition, as shown in Fig. 48c, when the oil film was wiped off the surface by paper towel, the lubricant stored in the oil storage capsules could be easily released by applying 500 g of pressure on the surface, which enabled quick replenishing of the lubricant layer to recover the liquid repellence.Then, the terminal -NH2 groups of the PDMS-IPDI@Oil further reacted with the -CHO groups of the chain extender terephthalic aldehyde (TPAL) to yield PDMS-IPDI@Oil with dynamic imine bond (named as PDMS-IPDI-TPAL@Oil).

        <p>Corrosion of metallic substances and their alloys in humid or hypersaline environments has caused waste and unsatisfactory strength of materials, environmental contamination and tremendous economic loss. 32,454 Casting a robust physical barrier between substrates and corrosive medium (e.g., H2O, O2 and chloride ions) has been recognized as an effective strategy to inhibit corrosion at the interface. 32,455 Superhydrophobic surfaces, superoleophobic surfaces and SLISs have attracted great interests because they can effectively protect metal surfaces from being corroded. 32,455,456 In terms of superhydrophobic and superamphiphobic surfaces, the anti-corrosion mechanism is where the air trapped in micro/nanostructures of superhydrophobic or superamphiphobic substrates protect surfaces from external environments. For example, Wang et al. endowed a magnesium alloy with robust hydrophobicity and corrosive resistance through chemical etching, zinc deposition and hydrophobic modification of ethanolic stearic acid solution. 457 On exposure to corrosive saline solution (3.5 wt% NaCl solution) and humid atmosphere (relative humidity of ~ 90%), superhydrophobic samples were hardly corroded until 12 hours and 96 hours, respectively. The anti-corrosion mechanisms include (1) air film prevents interaction of corrosive ions and substrates (Fig. 49a), and (2) superhydrophobic surfaces restrain the formation of an electrolyte film (Fig. 49b). After a tape peeling test, superhydrophobic surfaces retained their robustness and exhibited no delamination or detachment. Su et al. prepared superhydrophobic coatings on copper substrates as effective corrosion barriers through a nickel electrodeposition approach and subsequent hydrophobization. 458 The as-prepared superhydrophobic surface remained robust after mechanical damage (hardness and mechanical abrasion) and chemical erosion (acid and alkaline). Li et al. reported the corrosion resistance of a superhydrophobic layer on aluminum alloy substrates via a hydrothermal treatment in a La(NO3)3 solution and subsequent hydrophobic modification by dodecafluoroheptyl-propyl-trimethoxylsilane. 459 The superhydrophobic surfaces showed little change after being immersed in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution for 48 h and the water CA remained above 150°. The water CAs of the as-prepared surfaces were almost unchanged after being placed in air for 80 days, being exposed to a 250 °C atmosphere or being under UV irradiation for 24 h, and were above 150° after NaCl corrosion and abrasion. The strong bonding between lanthanum hydroxide and hydrophobic molecules formed during hydrothermal process, and hydrophobic lanthanum oxide contributed to sustaining the robustness of the resulting surfaces in harsh environments.

        <p>developed hydrophobic coatings with passivation ability for corrosion resistance of carbon steel using polyether sulfone (PES), potassium titanate whisker (PTW), nanoscale SiO2 and 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane via a spraying method. 460 Atomic oxygen was produced by oxygen vacancies on the surface of reduced potassium titanate whisker (RPTW) and then reacted with iron to generate passive films on carbon steel. Corrosive medium permeated micro-defects, voids, and cavities to the surface of carbon steel and then led to the corrosion of substrates (Fig. 49c). Despite of the existence of passive films, the electrolyte could still pass though the coatings and subsequently damage the passive film after long-term immersion (Fig. 49d). With the cooperative effect of passive film and air cushion, superhydrophobic layers were able to prevent the permeation of corrosive solution containing water and chloride ions (Fig. 49e). With similar water-repellent property to superhydrophobic surfaces, superamphiphobic surfaces are used as a durable barrier film for protecting metal surfaces from corrosion. 59,200 For example, Wei et al. revealed different anti-corrosion properties of superhydrophobic and superamphiphobic coatings for metal protection under different volumes of NaCl droplets. 348 Superhydrophobic hexadecyl polysiloxane modified SiO2 nanoparticles (HD-POS@SiO2) and superamphiphobic perfluorodecyl polysiloxane modified SiO2 nanoparticles (PF-POS@SiO2) were coated on magnesium alloy that was pretreated with epoxy paint (EP) via a spray-coating method, respectively. For water droplets larger than 0.9 μL, superhydrophobic and superamphiphobic coatings displayed the same wettability; hence superamphiphobic coatings showed better water repellent properties when water droplets were smaller than 0.9 μL. This was attributed to the lower surface energy of C-F in PF-POS@SiO2 nanoparticles than that of C-H groups in HD-POS@SiO2 nanoparticles. When small NaCl droplets adhered stably on the superhydrophobic coating, water (or vapor), oxygen and chloride ions diffused through the coating and then seriously eroded the metal substrates. However, affected by low-surface-energy C-F groups in PF-POS@SiO2 coatings, NaCl micro-droplets rolled off from the surface easily, the limited contact time and area between the NaCl droplets and superamphiphobic surface contributed to restricting the diffusion of corrosive medium effectively. In addition, robust superamphiphobic coatings could retain remarkable anti-corrosion performance after long-term immersion and neutral salt spray test.developed hydrophobic coatings with passivation ability for corrosion resistance of carbon steel using polyether sulfone (PES), potassium titanate whisker (PTW), nanoscale SiO2 and 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane via a spraying method. 460 Atomic oxygen was produced by oxygen vacancies on the surface of reduced potassium titanate whisker (RPTW) and then reacted with iron to generate passive films on carbon steel.

        <p>For SLISs that are applied in metal corrosion protection, the mechanism was similar to that of superhydrophobic surfaces, the air cushion trapped in hierarchical surfaces is replaced by a lubricant film. 32 For example, Sun et al. reported robust SLIS with excellent anti-corrosion performance via mimicking Nepenthes pitcher plant. 461 The SLIS were prepared as follows: α-zirconium phosphate (ZrP)/epoxy suspensions were coated on different substrates, followed by construction of superhydrophobic PTFE/graphite fluoride (GrF) micro/nanostructure layer, and perfluoropolyether (PFPE) infusion (Fig. 49f). The water CA and SA were respectively ~ 118° and ~ 2.3°, and the cetane CA was ~ 61°, and thus the oil layer possessed water resistance as well as resisted liquids with low surface tension.For SLISs that are applied in metal corrosion protection, the mechanism was similar to that of superhydrophobic surfaces, the air cushion trapped in hierarchical surfaces is replaced by a lubricant film. 32 For example, Sun et al. reported robust SLIS with excellent anti-corrosion performance via mimicking Nepenthes pitcher plant. 461 The SLIS were prepared as follows: α-zirconium phosphate (ZrP)/epoxy suspensions were coated on different substrates, followed by construction of superhydrophobic PTFE/graphite fluoride (GrF) micro/nanostructure layer, and perfluoropolyether (PFPE) infusion (Fig. 49f).

        <p>Superhydrophobic surfaces have been successfully used for inhibition of foulants, but they were found to be difficult to possess long-term anti-fouling performance. 467 For example, Dou et al. synthesized hierarchical surface via duplicating rose petal structures and then tuned its surface wettability from superhydrophilicity to superhydrophobicity through changing ratios of hydrophobic and hydrophilic compositions. 468 Due to the air or water trapped in hierarchical structures of superhydrophobic or superhydrophilic surfaces that reduced the interactions between bacterial and interfaces, there was less amount of Gram-positive bacterial attached on superhydrophobic (0.11 ng cm -2 ) and superhydrophilic (0.32 ng cm -2 ) surfaces but more bacterial on moderate surfaces (i.e., hydrophilicity (1.86 ng cm -2 ) and hydrophobicity (2.12 ng cm -2 )) (Fig. 50a). However, the behavior of Gram-negative bacterial adhesion was different from that of Gram-positive bacterial on superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic surfaces, which may be related to different polysaccharides existing in two kinds of bacterial shells. In addition, the stability of superhydrophobic or superhydrophilic surfaces was missing in this study. Wang et al. prepared micro/nanoscale diamond films on different substrates via chemical vapor deposition and self-assembly seeding method, and revealed different surface roughness towards anti-fouling performances. 176 Superhydrophobic hierarchical diamond coatings showed better anti-fouling performances (bacterial and marine algae) than that of flat diamond coatings, which was attributed to air layer trapped in micro/nanostructures enabling the minimal interaction area between foulants and superhydrophobic surfaces. Besides, hierarchical structures and diamond coatings also improved antibacterial efficiency and algae resistance. After exposure to nanoindentation, sandpaper abrasion, and corrosive solutions (including 3.5 %NaCl, acid and alkaline solution), diamond coatings showed chemical durability and mechanical robustness, still exhibiting hierarchical structures and possessing water CA of above 150°.Superhydrophobic surfaces have been successfully used for inhibition of foulants, but they were found to be difficult to possess long-term anti-fouling performance. 467 For example, Dou et al. synthesized hierarchical surface via duplicating rose petal structures and then tuned its surface wettability from superhydrophilicity to superhydrophobicity through changing ratios of hydrophobic and hydrophilic compositions. 468 Due to the air or water trapped in hierarchical structures of superhydrophobic or superhydrophilic surfaces that reduced the interactions between bacterial and interfaces, there was less amount of Gram-positive bacterial attached on superhydrophobic (0.11 ng cm -2 ) and superhydrophilic (0.32 ng cm -2 ) surfaces but more bacterial on moderate surfaces (i.e., hydrophilicity (1.86 ng cm -2 ) and hydrophobicity (2.12 ng cm -2 )) (Fig. 50a).

        <p>Hwang et al. investigated the dynamic trends of an air-bubble layer with time, and demonstrated that the ability of bacterial anti-adhesion on superhydrophobic surface was short-termed. 467 This is because after a period of time (2.5 h), the air cushion layer between bacterial suspension and rough surface disappeared, the performance of the superhydrophobic surface resisting bacteria was lost completely and bacterial adhesion significantly increased. In addition, superhydrophobic surfaces combined with antifouling agents have been used to resist foulants aiming for improving antifouling performance and long-term antifouling efficiency. 469,470 The water layer between solid and foulants protects substrates from being contaminated. 472 For example, Chen et al. developed robust superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic coatings on glass substrates for the repellence of marine foulants. 473 Hierarchical microgel spheres were prepared after SiO2 particles were coated on microgel spheres via complexing interaction. Subsequently, the hierarchical structures were hydrophilized using block copolymer. Then the resulting microgel spheres were coated on the glass via a self-assembly method, followed by coating a thermoset resin layer, washing using ethyl acetate and curing process. The modified coatings retained their mechanical and chemical stability after being damaged by abrasion, concussion or press and immersed in artificial sea water. The as-prepared coatings effectively protected the substrates from being adhered to by marine organisms such as proteins, bacteria, diatoms, macroalgae, and also exhibited long-term antibiofouling performance in harsh marine environment. In addition, superhydrophilic surfaces also show oil-repellent behavior when they are immersed in water. 236 For example, Chen et al. synthesized nacre-inspired hydrophilic mineralized films coated on different substrates using inorganic aragonite and chitosan derivatives. 62 The oil CA and SA of obtained films were 162.3 ± 2.7° and 1.6 ± 0.2°, indicating their low-oil-adhesion performance. After being immersed in water, the modified swimming goggles polluted by oil became clean immediately (Fig. 50b). Continuous lubricant films locked on the substrates effectively prevent foulants adhesion. 275 Tesler et al.Hwang et al. investigated the dynamic trends of an air-bubble layer with time, and demonstrated that the ability of bacterial anti-adhesion on superhydrophobic surface was short-termed. 467 This is because after a period of time (2.5 h), the air cushion layer between bacterial suspension and rough surface disappeared, the performance of the superhydrophobic surface resisting bacteria was lost completely and bacterial adhesion significantly increased.

Subsequently, slippery liquid-infused surfaces (TO-SLIS) were prepared after infusion of perfluoropolyether lubricants. When untreated, TO-SHS and TO-SLIS scalpels were immersed into blood and then washed by water, TO-SLIS scalpels exhibited remarkable blood repellent property (Fig. 50c). Besides, TO-SLIS coatings possessed more outstanding resistance performance towards reducing bacterial and green algae adhesion than that of the untreated and the TO-SHS surfaces. Additionally, robust TO-SLIS coatings retained repellent property after being damaged by abrasion due to their self-healing property. Wei et al. synthesized SLISs with long-term stability for biofouling resistance. 319 Low-surface-energy nanostructures on glass or aluminum substrates were fabricated by using methyltriethoxysilane, tetraethyl orthosilicate and n-octyltriethoxysilane via a polycondensation method, and then were infused with silicon oil to obtain slippery coatings. The prepared coatings could protect substrates from being contaminated by the adhesion of blood and bacteria and even inhibited protein adsorption owing to the lubricant loss.

        <p>Superhydrophobic surfaces have been demonstrated to possess the ability to effectively suppress ice formation due to the air cushion trapped in micro/nanostructures reducing the contact area of Liquid And cold solid interfaces. 479,481 For example, Guo et al. modulated surface topographies (i.e., micro/nano (MN)-structures, micro (M)-structures, nano (N)-structures and smooth (S)-structures) on stainless steel plates, and investigated the influence of the above surface morphologies on their anti-icing performance. 479 According to the delay time in ice formation on different surfaces, micro/nanostructured surfaces indicated anti-icing performance for a long time (~ 7000 s) while smooth (~ 30 s) and microstructured surfaces (~ 1260 s) showed short time to resist water droplets freezing at -10 °C (Fig. 51a). It is because high ratio of air trapped in micro/nanostructures minimized the contact area of water droplets and plate interfaces, and thus water droplets were effectively suspended. After 20 consecutive freeze-thaw damage, MN-surfaces were still robust, and retained their original properties. Normally, superhydrophobic surfaces may be impeded under high humid atmosphere. 482 Wang et al. reported robust superhydrophobic anti-icing surfaces that are used in high humidity. 481 The hierarchically micro/nanostructures comprised PDMS micropapillae and ZnO nanohairs, which were then modified with heptadecafluorodecyl tri-propoxy silane to create superhydrophobic surfaces. They remained dry and still possessed a water-rebounding ability after being placed at a temperature of -20 °C and a relative humidity of 90% for 3 months. Additionally, water droplets showed ultralow adhesion on the superhydrophobic surfaces under the condition of low temperatures, favoring anti-icing performance of the resultant surfaces. The exceptional properties were attributed to ZnO nanostructures repelling condensed droplets, PDMS micropapillae suspending droplets and cushioning the pressure from droplets impacting. After 100 freeze-thaw damage and bending processes, delay time for droplets freezing on surfaces was not less than 150 min, demonstrating their outstanding stability and robustness.

        <p>prepared superhydrophobic concrete with excellent anti-icing property by a metal mesh covering and hydrophobic modification of fluoroalkylsilane. 61 When the sloping angles of the prepared superhydrophobic surfaces were larger than their SA, rain droplets easily rolled off from the as-prepared surfaces while droplets were firmly adhered on unmodified surfaces and were then frozen into ice. In terms of horizonal surfaces or sloping angles of modified surfaces smaller than the SA of rain droplets, anti-icing properties of superhydrophobic surfaces were lost and both superhydrophobic and untreated surfaces were covered with ice. In addition, on original surfaces, it required a high shear force to remove ice (de-icing force: 336.8 N), while ice was completely cleaned up from the superhydrophobic surface with a de-icing force of only 25.5 N. It should be noted that anti-icing performance may be reduced after rough morphologies were destroyed during the de-icing process. Unlike superhydrophobic surfaces with rough surface morphologies, SLISs are completely covered with homogeneous and smooth lubricant layers. As a result, they can tackle some obstacles which superhydrophobic surfaces encounter under de-icing process and highly humid atmosphere, but the disadvantage of lubricant depletion remains unavoidable. 29,30 Benefitting from the low CAH of SLISs, water droplets can easily roll off these surfaces, and thus ice accumulation on surfaces is reduced. 11 For example, Wong et al. put forward a method of preventing lubricant depletion during anti-icing process, involving capillary pressure provided by SLISs being greater than the capillary-induced suction pressure caused by frost dendrites. 480 Both microstructured and nanostructured SLISs were constructed by the same micropillar array, but differences occurred between them when both surfaces were infused with silicone oil with or without the addition of epoxy-amine nanoparticles. Essentially, nanostructured SLIS possessing smaller interstitial spacing (30 nm) than microstructured SLIS (18 μm) and provided much stronger capillary retentive forces, resulting in reduced lubricant depletion (Fig. 51b,c). As a result, the lubricant layer of microstructured SLIS was damaged while the lubricant film of nanostructured SLIS remained unchanged during condensation-frosting process. After 50 de-icing cycles, there was no lubricant loss in nanostructured SLIS, indicating their exceptional robustness. Long et al. put SLIS and superhydrophobic surfaces in water with a tilting angle of 30° at -15 °C for 24 h in order to compare their anti-icing performance. 484 SLIS were shown to exhibit superior anti-icing performance than the superhydrophobic surface in terms of ice adhesion of SLIS (6.2 kPa) and superhydrophobic surface (35.2 kPa). After 12 icing/drawing cycles, the water CAs of the superhydrophobic surface decreased from 156.1° to 108.9°, while that of SLIS almost remained unchanged (~ 106.3°), which demonstrated that the as-prepared SLIS were robust and durable.

        <p>According to the above discussion and analysis, first, SLISs show better anti-icing performance than superhydrophobic surfaces. Second, surface textures play an important role in anti-icing performance of superhydrophobic surfaces or reducing lubricant depletion of SLISs. The damage of rough morphologies of superhydrophobic surfaces is irreversible in the de-icing process, but lubricant layers of SLISs can be restored by refilling the lubricants. Finally, the robustness of both surfaces needs to be improved in practical conditions.According to the above discussion and analysis, first, SLISs show better anti-icing performance than superhydrophobic surfaces.

In contrast, the same microdroplet could not be transferred from square array to triangle array because of poor reversibility. Furthermore, these obtained films remained robust after external damages including stretching, folding, twisting and rubbing. These stable performances were attributed to the strong chemical bonding between the graphene oxide film and the latex substrate.utilization of different water adhesion on different superhydrophobic surfaces for no-loss water transportation in a programmable way; (b) loss-free water motion in a direction on superhydrophobic surfaces with the help of external driving forces. 492 Theoretically, whether two methods can be applied for water manipulation is primarily related to water wetting states on superhydrophobic surfaces.

Laplace pressure also contributes to the water harvesting process. Bai et al. fabricated artificial cactus spines with nanogroove-based structures for water collection using micrometer silver needles and the imidization reaction of polystyrene and poly(amic acid). 496 Hierarchical nanogrooves facilitated water harvesting and transportation, and the water transportation velocity was ~ 360 µm/s. Superhydrophobic surfaces exhibit underwater superaerophilicity and possess high bubble adhesive force, which are used for underwater gas bubbles capture and transportation. 497,498 In this process, when a superhydrophobic surface was immersed in water, a continuous layer of gas film was firstly formed on the superhydrophobic surface and then captured underwater gas bubbles. Finally, the collected bubbles were released from the as-prepared surface via Laplace pressure. 493 For example, Yin et al. fabricated robust superhydrophobic PTFE meshes to transport and collect underwater gas bubbles continuously. 493 The hierarchical micro/nanostructures of one-sided PTFE meshes were constructed via a femtosecond laser ablation.

        <p>fabricated Cu(OH)2 nanostructures by immersing Cu foils in 0.03 M ammonia solution at 5.0 °C for 36-48 h, which were then reacted with 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecanethiol in its ethanol solution (~ 0.01 M ) for 1-36 h to prepare superoleophobic surface in air. By controlling the reaction time (Fig. 53a) and preload force to hexadecane droplet (Fig. 53b), the adhesion between the droplet and superoleophobic surface could be well regulated. 148 Depending on the tunable adhesive force, transport of hexadecane droplet was realized on the prepared superoleophobic surface in air (Fig. 53c). Chao et al. fabricated superamphiphobic Cu surfaces by nanosecond laser directly writing, followed by alkali assistant oxidation reaction, and fluoroalkylthiolate modification, whose oil adhesion performance in air could be tuned by changing the grid spacings of laser ablation. 501 As the grid spacings changed from 60 µm to 480 µm, the surface roughness factor got smaller and the wetting behaviors of oils were correspondingly transformed from the Cassie-Baxter state to the Wenzel state, which enabled loss-free transportation of oils by using different interfaces with programmable oil adhesion behaviors. Compared with the superoleophobic surfaces in air, oil droplet manipulation on underwater superoleophobic surfaces have drawn more attention due to their feasibility to control the adhesion between oil droplet and surfaces. 59,503 For example, Huo et al. adjusted surface adhesive forces of different types of glass plates to manipulate oil droplets in water in a programable routine. 504 By changing the ratios of flat and rough areas of glass using a femtosecond laser ablation, adhesive forces became controllable. A droplet of oil (1,2-dichloroethane, 7 μL) could be transferred from ultralow adhesive surface and then pinned on the ultrahigh adhesive surface without any oil loss in a designed routine. The same group further realized lossless oil droplet transport on underwater superoleophobic surface with ultralow oil-adhesion by changing the buoyancy of oil droplet in water solution (Fig. 53d). 502 They irradiated silicon surface with femtosecond laser to construct periodic rough micro-mountain array with a period of ~ 10 μm, which showed superhydrophilicity in air and superoleophobicity underwater with ultra-low oil adhesion. As shown in Fig. 53d, the pre-deposited oil droplet on Sample A could float up when the density of water solution was increased by adding sugar, and then the droplet was captured by Sample B due to the increased buoyancy. Then Sample C was moved below the oil droplet, and the water solution was diluted to decrease the floatage on the oil droplet, which finally resulted in the transport of the oil droplet to Sample C. In practical applications, no-loss manipulation of oil microdroplets is of great importance in chemical or biological reactions. 247 Additionally, superhydrophilic membranes that are assembled into membrane devices for oil/water separation 505 or advanced funnel-like device for oils collection 485 have emerged in order to transport/collect a large scale of underwater oils with high efficiency.fabricated Cu(OH)2 nanostructures by immersing Cu foils in 0.03 M ammonia solution at 5.0 °C for 36-48 h, which were then reacted with 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecanethiol in its ethanol solution (~ 0.01 M ) for 1-36 h to prepare superoleophobic surface in air.

        <p>Hydrophobic SLISs were obtained after infusing the superhydrophobic surfaces with hydrophobic lubricant (PMX200/5cs). The modified slippery surfaces exhibited superior water collection performance (~ 0.8 g cm -3 ) than that of superhydrophobic surfaces (~ 0.5 g cm -3 ) in terms of the weight of the harvested water. This is because tiny fog droplets were captured by nanospines, grew larger and finally formed a layer of water film on superhydrophobic surfaces. In this case, the formation of water layer hindered water removal and new droplets capture on the superhydrophobic foam, resulting in unsatisfactory water collection performance. However, slippery interfaces were able to quickly capture tiny droplets and continuously promote the water transportation and removal under the synergistic effect of nanospines and low SAs, and thus the efficiency of water harvesting was improved. Additionally, these as-prepared slippery foams maintained stable fog harvesting efficiency at ~ 25% and fog harvesting rate of 15.2 g cm -3 h -1 for 30 consecutive cycles, and also retained low lubricant loss (~ 6.7%). The robustness was mainly attributed to nanospines on modified slippery foams which endowed strong capillary force, allowing lubricant to be trapped on resulted foams. Gou et al. reported the effects of two different kinds of morphologies of SLISs towards water harvesting behavior. 510 The modified SLISs were prepared after etching of copper foils, morphologies control using cationic or anionic surfactants, surface hydrophobic modification, and hydrophobic lubricant infusion. SLISs with nanolamellas displayed better water collection performance (13.04 mg min cm -2 ) than that of needles-assembled surfaces (9.68 mg min cm -2 ) because of excellent retention of lubricant layer in nanolamellas-based structures. The as-prepared SLISs showed chemical and physical robustness under harsh environments, such as corrosive solutions, long-term storage, and ultraviolet light exposure, which was ascribed to surface textures on SLISs. In addition to hydrophobic SLISs, hydrophilic ones are developed and show exceptional water harvesting performance. For example, Dai et al. investigated water harvesting rates on different surfaces, and found that hydrophilic slippery rough surfaces (SRS) displayed faster water microdroplets nucleation and removal than those of hydrophilic or hydrophobic SLIS and hierarchical superhydrophobic surface (SHS, no lubricants) (Fig. 54c-e). 156 The as-prepared hydrophilic SRS were fabricated by combining the features of pitcher plants (SLIS) and rice leaves (directional and hierarchical structures) to facilitate water droplets harvesting and mobility. The performance of water harvesting on hydrophilic SRS, hydrophilic or hydrophobic SLIS and hierarchical SHS were about 500, 350, 200 and 175 mg h -1 cm -2 , respectively.Hydrophobic SLISs were obtained after infusing the superhydrophobic surfaces with hydrophobic lubricant (PMX200/5cs).

        <p>By tuning surface chemistry and increasing surface roughness, water collection performance could be significantly promoted. After continuous 1000 droplet shedding, liquid repellency remained excellent, as the lubricants were maintained in the nano-textured surfaces. This is because the capillary force in nanostructures protected lubricants from being damaged. Additionally, lubricant detachment could be further reduced by using lubricants with higher viscosity.By tuning surface chemistry and increasing surface roughness, water collection performance could be significantly promoted.

        <p>Besides water harvesting, SLISs have also been designed to manipulate underwater bubbles dependent on buoyancy. 511,512 For example, Wang et al. prepared a slippery track with remarkable mechanical stability for underwater bubbles manipulation. 509 Superhydrophobic coatings were constructed on porous alumina ceramic substrates under UV irradiation using the mixtures of vinyl triethoxy silane, hydrophobic fumed silicas and photo initiator. Afterwards, SLISs were obtained when silicone oils were infused into the porous superhydrophobic substrates. The as-prepared slippery track exhibited underwater bubble CA of 72.8 ± 3.8° and possessed the ability to transport bubbles (10 μL) from lower to upper surface of an S-shaped track (Fig. 54f). The mechanism of bubbles moving is as follows: driving forces originated from adhesion and buoyancy promoted the motion of bubbles when the slippery track was tilted at a certain angle (Fig. 54g). When the samples were soaked in water for 28 days, owing to the existence of hydrophobic fumed silica, the as-prepared surfaces retained excellent slippery performance and maintained the SA of below 10°, showing a stable and durable silicone oil layer. As discussed above, superhydrophobic surfaces are also able to capture and deliver underwater bubbles, primarily relying on Laplace pressure as a driving force, which was induced from asymmetric geometric structures of superhydrophobic surfaces, such as trapezoidal and cone or star-based shapes. 511 However, it may be ineffective for superhydrophobic surfaces under pressure or highly humid atmosphere because of the disappearance of the air cushion; while SLISs could always self-repair the lubricant once the layers are damaged. 510,513 Fig. 54 A surface that combines both (super)hydrophilic and superhydrophobic areas is usually applied for water collection. In this combination, water microdroplets are absorbed and condensate on hydrophilic areas, and the superhydrophobic areas promote the efficiency of water removal. For example, in nature, desert beetle, Stenocara, with a hydrophilic/superhydrophobic patterned surface on its back, possesses a unique ability for water collection from fog-rich wind. 514,515 The elytra of the desert beetle are covered with an array of bumps, whose sizes are ~ 0.5 mm in diameter (Fig. 55a). The peaks of bumps are smooth and wax-free (hydrophilic) while troughs consist of microstructure covered with wax (Fig. 55b). These microstructures are flattened hemispheres in shape with the diameter of ~ 10 μm and exhibit superhydrophobicity (Fig. 55c). 515 Water microdroplets from moist atmosphere condensate and then coalesce on hydrophilic regions, which are viewed as nucleation sites. After reaching a critical size, water droplets are transported to the beetles' mouths through superhydrophobic areas (wax regions) when the beetles tilt their bodies. 516 According to this interesting natural phenomenon, a robust hydrophilic/superhydrophobic surface was fabricated for water harvesting by deposition of PTFE nanoparticles on a superhydrophobic copper mesh and a hydrophilic copper sheet using femtosecond laser ablation. 517 The as-prepared sample exhibited water CA of 159 ± 2°, water SA of 3° and low water adhesion, which mainly contributed to high water collection rate. In addition, by tuning mesh numbers transformed from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. This approach created low-surface-energy and rough surface simultaneously, and provided superhydrophobic and oleophilic properties of calcium carbonate particles. The water CA of modified calcium carbonate particles was 152°. As a result, these powders floated on water surface and adsorbed oil contaminants autonomously. By quantitative study of calcium carbonate's oil adsorption performance under different ratios of oil and water, the removal efficiencies towards crude oil and diesel oil from water were all greater than 98%.Besides water harvesting, SLISs have also been designed to manipulate underwater bubbles dependent on buoyancy. 511,512 For example, Wang et al. prepared a slippery track with remarkable mechanical stability for underwater bubbles manipulation. 509 Superhydrophobic coatings were constructed on porous alumina ceramic substrates under UV irradiation using the mixtures of vinyl triethoxy silane, hydrophobic fumed silicas and photo initiator.

        <p>Hydrophobic and oleophilic particulate adsorbents are combined with magnetic particles to fabricate highly efficient magnetic oil adsorbents, such as titania nanotubes, porous carbon and silicon powders etc., which can be easily re-collected and separated by a magnetic separation process. [527][528][529] For example, Pathak et al. fabricated magnetically driven superhydrophobic and oleophilic titania nanotubes with maximum oil adsorption capacity of 1.5 g g -1 . 530 Magnetic titania nanotubes were fabricated via a hydrothermal method by using magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4) and titania nanotubes, and were subsequently post-modified with hydrophobic octadecylamine. The as-prepared titania nanotubes had a water CA of 166 ± 1° and were capable of adsorbing oil from water selectively, and could be separated under an external magnetic force. However, bare Fe3O4 nanoparticles tend to be instable under acid conditions. Developing core-shell magnetic materials may be a good strategy to improve Fe3O4 stability under a harsh environment. For example, superhydrophobic core-shell Fe2O3@C nanoparticles were synthesized for fast and selective adsorption of oils from water. 528 The Fe2O3@C nanoparticles were prepared after thermal decomposition of ferric benzoate precursor at 600 °C for 6 h, followed by coating with hydrophobic vinyl trimethoxysilane (Fig. 56a), endowing the as-synthesized Fe2O3@C nanoparticles with water CA of 162.9 ± 2°. The porous Fe2O3@C nanoparticles could selectively adsorb various oils with the capacity up to 3.8 times of their own weight while completely repelling water. After adsorption, magnetic materials along with oils could be separated by a magnet bar (Fig. 56b). In addition, Fe2O3@C nanoparticles exhibited outstanding chemical stability and retained water CA of &gt; 150° under 0.1 M NaCl and solutions with pH ranging from 3 to 14.

        <p>utilized etching and in situ growth method to prepare superhydrophobic zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-L) coated meshes for oil/water separation. 532 The stainless steel meshes were firstly etched by HCl for one hour followed by immersion in the precursor solutions of ZIF-L. Then a layer of hydrophobic ZIF-L with dagger-like structure was grown in situ on the surfaces of the meshes (Fig. 57a). The resulting meshes exhibited water CA of 155.4 ± 1.8°, and achieved isooctane flux of 1.75 × 10 5 L m -2 h -1 and separation efficiency of 99.7%. The hydrophobic modified meshes with long-term water resistance and stability possessed water CAs of above 150°. Moreover, the modified meshes displayed outstanding antibacterial performance, reducing the opportunity of the hydrophobic layer being destroyed by bacteria due to the existence of Zn ions and 2-methimidazole (Hmim). Li et al. reported superhydrophobic hybrid meshes with high stability under conditions of hot water and strong corrosive solutions through a spray-coating method (Fig. 57b). 533 The robust superhydrophobic meshes with water CA of 160 ± 1° were fabricated via sequential deposition of candle soot and SiO2 particles. The modified stainless mesh could be made into a small box and put on a beaker. The kerosene could selectively permeate through the box and be collected into the beaker with the separation efficiency of higher than 99.0%. Furthermore, the as-prepared meshes were chemically stable and possessed robust hydrophobicity, showing water CA of above 150° under harsh conditions, for example, strong acidic, alkaline, salty solutions, and even hot water. Commercial textiles, such as, cotton textiles and polymer-based textiles, are widely reported as porous substrates for oil/water separation. 521,536 For example, Zhou et al. used cyclic self-assembly and dip-coating method to synthesize superhydrophobic cotton fabrics for oil/water separation. 534 Phytic acid (PA) molecules were firmly anchored on cotton fabrics via covalent bonds and then coordinated with metal ions to create hierarchical micro/nanostructures on the fabrics. Subsequently, intermediate fabrics were hydrophobically modified via PDMS, the resulting fabrics with water CAs of 152.9 ± 1.8° were obtained after 8 cycles of self-assembly (Fig. 57c). The separation efficiencies of hydrophobic fabric for all tested oils were above 95%. After 30 cycles of abrasion tests and 300-cycle peeling tests, the water CAs of as-prepared fabric were 142.5 ± 2.5° and above 150°, respectively, retaining excellent hydrophobicity. In addition, superhydrophobicity of the modified fabrics exhibited no obvious change under UV radiation, high temperature and chemical solvents. The robustness of the resulting meshes was attributed to covalent bonds between the polymer and hydroxyl groups of the fabric. Zhou et al. modified cotton fabric with a hydrophobic layer comprising of FeCl3/1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane (PTES) and polyaniline (PANI) micro/nanoparticles through a vapor phrase deposition method (Fig. 57d). 535 A piece of cotton fabric was firstly coated with a layer of FeCl3 and PTES. Subsequently, micro/nanoscale PANI granules were prepared onto the fabric surface by placing intermediates in a chamber filled with aniline via polymerization. Low-surface-energy material PTES molecules were linked with PANI granules via hydrogen bonding. When superhydrophobic fabrics were attacked by acidic and alkaline liquids, or damaged by abrasion and scratch, they still maintained microstructure and surface chemical compositions of the fabric. Under high humidity and temperature, they also kept highly hydrophobicity. After long-term separation, hierarchical nanostructures on the fabric surface were mostly retained. These remarkable performances of modified fabrics may be ascribed to hydrogen bonding between PANI and PTES. Additionally, the hydrophobic fabrics achieved separation efficiency of as high as 97.8%. In addition to stainless steel meshes and cotton fabrics, electrospun films as porous substrates have been studied in the past few decades. Zhang et al. prepared polyimide (PI) electrospun hybrid films with hydrophobicity. 537 The PI films were dipped in PDMS solutions and then decorated with ZnO particles via a hydrothermal reaction for 5 h at 110 °C, the hydrophobic hybrid films were prepared. The separation efficiencies towards oils or organic solvents were all above 90%. After exposure to different damages, such as acidic and alkaline solvents, high temperatures and chemical corrosion, the water CA of modified films remained unchanged. Additionally, the PI hybrid films were resistant to UV radiation for 24 h due to the presence of ZnO particles.utilized etching and in situ growth method to prepare superhydrophobic zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-L) coated meshes for oil/water separation. 532 The stainless steel meshes were firstly etched by HCl for one hour followed by immersion in the precursor solutions of ZIF-L. Then a layer of hydrophobic ZIF-L with dagger-like structure was grown in situ on the surfaces of the meshes (Fig. 57a). The resulting meshes exhibited water CA of 155.4 ± 1.8°, and achieved isooctane flux of 1.75 × 10 5 L m -2 h -1 and separation efficiency of 99.7%. The hydrophobic modified meshes with long-term water resistance and stability possessed water CAs of above 150°. Moreover, the modified meshes displayed outstanding antibacterial performance, reducing the opportunity of the hydrophobic layer being destroyed by bacteria due to the existence of Zn ions and 2-methimidazole (Hmim). Li et al. reported superhydrophobic hybrid meshes with high stability under conditions of hot water and strong corrosive solutions through a spray-coating method (Fig. 57b). 533 The robust superhydrophobic meshes with water CA of 160 ± 1° were fabricated via sequential deposition of candle soot and SiO2 particles. The modified stainless mesh could be made into a small box and put on a beaker. The kerosene could selectively permeate through the box and be collected into the beaker with the separation efficiency of higher than 99.0%. Furthermore, the as-prepared meshes were chemically stable and possessed robust hydrophobicity, showing water CA of above 150° under harsh conditions, for example, strong acidic, alkaline, salty solutions, and even hot water. Commercial textiles, such as, cotton textiles and polymer-based textiles, are widely reported as porous substrates for oil/water separation. 521,536 For example, Zhou et al. used cyclic self-assembly and dip-coating method to synthesize superhydrophobic cotton fabrics for oil/water separation. 534 Phytic acid (PA) molecules were firmly anchored on cotton fabrics via covalent bonds and then coordinated with metal ions to create hierarchical micro/nanostructures on the fabrics. Subsequently, intermediate fabrics were hydrophobically modified via PDMS, the resulting fabrics with water CAs of 152.9 ± 1.8° were obtained after 8 cycles of self-assembly (Fig. 57c). The separation efficiencies of hydrophobic fabric for all tested oils were above 95%. After 30 cycles of abrasion tests and 300-cycle peeling tests, the water CAs of as-prepared fabric were 142.5 ± 2.5° and above 150°, respectively, retaining excellent hydrophobicity. In addition, superhydrophobicity of the modified fabrics exhibited no obvious change under UV radiation, high temperature and chemical solvents. The robustness of the resulting meshes was attributed to covalent bonds between the polymer and hydroxyl groups of the fabric. Zhou et al. modified cotton fabric with a hydrophobic layer comprising of FeCl3/1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane (PTES) and polyaniline (PANI) micro/nanoparticles through a vapor phrase deposition method (Fig. 57d). 535 A piece of cotton fabric was firstly coated with a layer of FeCl3 and PTES.

        <p>Commercially available polymeric sponges or foams, such as polyurethane sponge and melamine sponge, have been widely used as ideal 3D porous substrates for the preparation of oil adsorbents because of their light weight, high adsorption capacity, as well as excellent recyclability and elasticity. 539 However, amphiphilic polyurethane sponges or melamine sponges are not suitable for oils adsorption due to the lack of selectivity towards oils and water. There are two effective ways to modify polymeric sponges or foams transforming from amphiphilicity to hydrophobicity. The first approach is to improve surface polarity via chemical reactions, i.e., surface polarity of chemical groups is proportional to surface energy.Commercially available polymeric sponges or foams, such as polyurethane sponge and melamine sponge, have been widely used as ideal 3D porous substrates for the preparation of oil adsorbents because of their light weight, high adsorption capacity, as well as excellent recyclability and elasticity. 539 However, amphiphilic polyurethane sponges or melamine sponges are not suitable for oils adsorption due to the lack of selectivity towards oils and water.

        <p>Polyurethane or melamine sponges possess abundant polar groups, such as amine and triazine groups, which could bond with modifying agents or metal ions to endow polyurethane or melamine sponge hydrophobicity. 540 For example, Ding et al. developed metal ions-induced highly hydrophobic melamine sponges for oil adsorption via a dip-coating method. 540 The mechanism of melamine sponges transforming from hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity was that N atoms of amine and triazine groups were coordinated with metal ions (including Fe III , Zn II , Co II and Ni II ) (Fig. 58a). The reduction of polar groups led to hydrophobicity of pure melamine foams. Therefore, as-synthesized sponges could selectively adsorb oil and repel water, and the adsorption capacity were 71-157 times of its own weight. The resultant oil adsorbents kept robust after mechanical squeezing, and also showed remarkable resistance to flame. Pham et al. synthesized superhydrophobic melamine sponges with low-surface-energy material octadecyltrichlorosilane. The melamine sponges were contacted with hydrophobic modifying agent through (i) direct hydrogen bonding between secondary amine groups and silanol, and (ii) hydrogen bonding produced between amine groups and oligomers formed by condensation of the Si-OH (Fig. 58b). 541 After that, sponges turned from amphiphilicity into superhydrophobicity and showed water CA of 151.0 ± 1.1°. The as-prepared sponges could selectively adsorb oil or organic solvents and achieved the adsorption capacities of 82-163 times of their own weight.

        <p>The second strategy is the construction of superhydrophobic nanomaterials onto the skeleton surfaces of sponges or foams, such as metal organic frameworks, graphene oxide or other nanoparticles that are post-modified by hydrophobic agents. For example, Gu et al. prepared robust superhydrophobic wrinkled microspheres-coated polyurethane sponges for efficient oil/water separation via a dip-coating method (Fig. 58c). 178 When a piece of polyurethane sponge used as a substrate was dipped in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-8)@reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and polydimethylsiloxane suspension, superhydrophobic ZIF-8@rGO microspheres-coated polyurethane sponge was fabricated. The as-prepared polyurethane sponges with water CA of 171° could remove oil from water selectively and achieved a high adsorption capacity of 1400-2900 wt% towards various oils and organic solvents. Robust sponges could retain excellent superhydrophobicity after repeated squeezing due to the firm adhesion of microspheres onto the interlaced branches of the sponge. Zhu et al. prepared hydrophobic ZIF-8-coated melamine sponges through an in situ growth reaction (Fig. 58d). 542 After a melamine sponge was immersed into the precursor solution of ZIF-8, sponge skeletons were completely covered with a layer of hydrophobic ZIF-8 nanoparticles, which improved chemical composition and roughness of the surfaces simultaneously. The thin wettable layer was robust and stable, and kept intact even after over ten cycles of compressive tests. In addition, the adsorption capacities of the resultant sponge were 74-145 times of that of its own weight. Zhu et al. immersed a sponge into graphene oxide nanosheets solution, followed by chemical reduction of graphene oxide into rGO though a hydrothermal reaction (Fig. 58e). 543 Hydrophobic rGO nanosheets were anchored firmly on the sponge's skeleton via the van der Waals force, which created hierarchical roughness and lowered surface energy on surface of the sponge. The resulting sponges displayed a water CA of 151.4° and selectively adsorbed oils from water, with the adsorption capacity of 60-140 times of its own weight. After 50 cycles of adsorption-squeezing process, adsorption efficiency did not decline significantly. Besides, the rGO-modified sponges possessed outstanding flame-retardant property. Zhu et al. fabricated polysiloxane-coated polyurethane sponges using methyltrichlorosilane though a one-step immersion method (Fig. 58f). 544 Polysiloxane was formed after the hydrolysis of methyltrichlorosilane, and was anchored firmly on the sponges' surface, leading to hierarchical surface roughness and low surface energy. The adsorption capacity of obtained superhydrophobic adsorbents were 15-25 times of their own weight. The superhydrophobic sponges exhibited remarkable chemical and thermal stability, and had a water CA of &gt; 150° after immersing in strong acid or alkali solution and even exposed to a temperature range of 30-90 °C. In addition, superhydrophobicity and elasticity of the modified sponges showed no decline even after 300 consecutive compressions, possessing excellent mechanical stability.The second strategy is the construction of superhydrophobic nanomaterials onto the skeleton surfaces of sponges or foams, such as metal organic frameworks, graphene oxide or other nanoparticles that are post-modified by hydrophobic agents.

        <p>Carbon-based materials with super water repellence are also one of the most used oil adsorbents. For example, Chen et al. prepared superhydrophobic poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)-based foams using table salt as a sacrificial template. 64 PVDF, multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) and table salt were mixed together and then heated at the temperature of 200 °C for 30 min. After cooling and dissolution of the table salt, the porous superhydrophobic PVDF-MWCNT foams with water CAs of 152.6 ± 4.5° were obtained. The foams possessed adsorption capacities of 300-1200% to oils or organic solvents with different densities. Besides, the foams were highly resistant towards UV radiation, corrosive solutions, and turbulent conditions. Compared with polymer-based sponges and foams, carbon materials derived from biomass show outstanding features of intrinsic hydrophobicity, fire-resistance and chemical stability.Carbon-based materials with super water repellence are also one of the most used oil adsorbents.

        <p>3D monoliths could selectively in situ adsorb oils, possess high adsorption capacity, and could be easily regenerated by squeezing or combustion after adsorption. However, it is ineffective for adsorbents to remove crude oils with high viscosity because the process of crude oils infusing into porous structure is relatively slow compared with light oils. During desorption, porous structure and hydrophobic coatings may be damaged after consecutive squeezing and combustion, and thus selectivity and adsorption capacities are directly influenced. Besides, when adsorbents were affected by external harsh surroundings, such as wave or heavy rain, oils may be desorbed from adsorbents.3D monoliths could selectively in situ adsorb oils, possess high adsorption capacity, and could be easily regenerated by squeezing or combustion after adsorption.

        <p>Oil adsorbents, namely particulate adsorbents and 3D monoliths, exhibit some excellent features of in situ oil removal, easy operation and spontaneous adsorption. It was challenging to collect used adsorbents that spread over wide ocean surface in severe ocean weather, even though they possess magnetism and millimeter size. Furthermore, the complicated regeneration process and limited adsorption capacity may hinder further practical applications of powder-formed adsorbents. In some cases, the combination of particles and 3D monoliths may be an effective approach to adsorb oils from sea surface. 3D monoliths are applied to remove a large amount of oil and then particle adsorbents are used to remove thin residual oil layer. Superhydrophobic 2D filters are capable of selective oils or organic solvents separation with high efficiency and continuous operation, but their usage may be impeded for separation of heavy oils (e.g., tetrachloromethane). The disposal of used filters is a great challenge because the eluting agents not may be environmentally friendly and even damage hydrophobic structures. All oils adsorbents and filter materials face the problem of durability and stability in harsh environments, such as high temperature, corrosive solutions, UV exposure, mechanical disruption and turbulent surroundings. In short, lots of challenges need to be overcome for design of next-generation superhydrophobic adsorbents and filters.Oil adsorbents, namely particulate adsorbents and 3D monoliths, exhibit some excellent features of in situ oil removal, easy operation and spontaneous adsorption.

        <p>The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), firstly introduced by Wang's group, is based on combined effects of contact electrification and electrostatic induction. 546 Recently, the droplet based-TENG has received extensive interest because it could effectively convert low-frequency motion of water into electric energy. Using the liquid itself as the triboelectric material overcomes the inevitable friction wear between two solid materials. 34,35,[547][548][549] In this section, nanogenerators with different types of interfaces are divided into liquid-solid TENG and liquid-liquid TENG. 34 For liquid-solid TENG, it is classified into single electrode mode and freestanding mode according to the numbers of electrodes. 550 Liquid-solid TENG. Liquid-solid TENGs with liquid-repellent solid surfaces can timely shed droplets from the surface without forming liquid film even at high impact frequency, resulting in enhanced electrical output. 551 Cho et al. fabricated superhydrophobic TENGs with different surface structures (nanostructures and hierarchical structures) and investigated the effect of two types of morphologies towards electric output performance. 552 The as-prepared TENGs were composed of nanostructured and hierarchically structured Al(OH)3, which were etched on aluminum using alkali or acid etching method and superhydrophobic treatment (heptadecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrodecyl-trichlorosilane). As a result, a droplet of water impacting on the hierarchically structured surface rebounded from the surface while the water droplet tended to adhere on the nanostructured surface. The effect of water droplet release height and remaining water on both surfaces on energy harvesting were compared. When water droplets were sequentially released on two surfaces at the height of 1 cm, the output voltage from the nanostructured surface greatly decreased, but the voltage from hierarchically structured surface only slightly fluctuated.The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), firstly introduced by Wang's group, is based on combined effects of contact electrification and electrostatic induction. 546 Recently, the droplet based-TENG has received extensive interest because it could effectively convert low-frequency motion of water into electric energy.

        <p>Besides, it was easy for a thin water layer to generate on nanostructured superhydrophobic surfaces due to the disappearance of the air cushion. Therefore, the output voltage significantly reduced and then towards no electric output when the impact velocity of water droplets was low. However, in terms of superhydrophobic surfaces with hierarchical structures, water droplets at high impact velocity were split into different sizes, large droplets rebounded while small droplets got pinned on the hierarchically structured surface. Therefore, the energy harvesting performance was decreased. When another water droplet coalesced with the remaining small droplets, an improvement of output voltage resulted. In addition, superhydrophobic surfaces with hierarchical structures showed excellent resistance to low surface tension liquids and highly viscous liquids, and could generate stable output voltage as well. Differing from traditional TENGs whose electrodes were underlying dielectric layers, Zhang et al. synthesized single electrode droplet-based electricity generator (DEG), in which the Al electrode was arranged on the top of different artificial and natural dielectric materials, such as PTFE, silicon, aloe, cicada wing, stone, wood, paper and glass (Fig. 59a). 547 Among these surfaces, stone, wood, paper and glass were pre-modified via commercial hydrophobic spray (NeverWet). All the as-mentioned surfaces were demonstrated to be hydrophobic, leading to the rapid refreshment of liquid-solid surfaces after continuous water droplets impinging. When a water droplet impacted the solid surface and then spread to contact the Al electrode, the solid material and Al electrode was connected, and thus there was an electric output between Al electrode and ground. After the water droplet left the solid surface, the output disappeared. The as-prepared electricity generators can drive a calculator or store energy when PTFE or aloe/stone were selected as solid materials, respectively. Besides, the resulted electricity generator could be arranged on any surfaces to harvest kinetic energy of water droplets and then convert into electricity power.Besides, it was easy for a thin water layer to generate on nanostructured superhydrophobic surfaces due to the disappearance of the air cushion.

        <p>The generation of electric output from freestanding TENGs relied on effective contact area, which was determined by the water spreading and shrinking on the PTFE surface. When installed on an umbrella, the as-prepared TENGs could generate the maximum power density of 1.838 W m -2 and light up ~ 30 light-emitting diodes (LEDs) instantaneously. Hu et al. developed superhydrophobic TENGs, which consisted of a superhydrophobic layer and several Cu electrodes, for biomedical applications. 553 The resultant TENGs were fabricated after Cu electrodes with double-sided adhesive tapes were coated with hydrophobic fumed silicon via a dip-coating method (Fig. 59b). The TENGs exhibited excellent repellency towards various liquids with CAs of near 160° to droplets of HCl, NaOH, water, blood, urine and phosphate buffer. A water droplet impacted the superhydrophobic TENG, due to contact electrification, the water droplet and the solid surface were positively charged and negatively charged, respectively. As shown in Fig. 59c, when the as-prepared TENG was tilted at 20°, a water droplet with positive charges touched the superhydrophobic surface, the first electrode exhibited negative charge, the other electrode displayed positive charge, and thus a pulsed current was generated. When a droplet of water contacted solid surface above the second Cu electrode, this electrode was negatively charged, while the other was positively charged. These two obtained pulsed currents were opposite. The superhydrophobic liquid-solid TENGs can be used for medical application as droplet sensors via detecting the signal of pulsed currents. In addition, the device was robust due to the existence of sticky force between superhydrophobic fumed silicon particles and double-sided tapes. Recently, Zhang et al. proposed an efficient raindrop energy-based TENG by using a superhydrophobic polyethylene (PE) film as a negative triboelectric layer material. 554 As depicted in Fig. 59d, the outer surface of the PE film was firstly functionalized by plasma to gain superhydrophobicity and then a thin copper upper electrode was attached on, while the inner surface of the film was spin-coated with a thin layer of poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and was used as a lower electrode. Owing to electrostatic induction, at initial impacting stage between water droplet and the film surface, equal negative charges and positive charges were respectively generated on the film and lower electrode, and no current formed between the lower and upper electrodes. As the droplet spread and contacted with the upper electrode, the film acquired more electrons based on liquid-solid contact electrification, and electrostatically induced positive charges on the lower electrode were transferred to the upper electrode, which resulted in an electrical output. When the water droplet completely spread on the upper electrode, the two electrodes and PE film were connected to form a closed-loop electrical system, enabling the generation of triboelectric charges through the bulk effect between the lower/upper electrode and the film rather than through the traditional interfacial electrostatic induction between the lower electrode and the film. The interfacial screening effect was consequently avoided, and effective triboelectric charge transfer was thus realized. After the droplet rolled off from the film, the charges moved back from the upper electrode to the lower electrode, and the cyclic electricity generation process could thereby be realized by another water droplet impact. When the dripping frequency and height of simulated rain droplets were respectively set to 2 Hz and 15 cm, a 10 μF capacitor was charged to ~ 6 V after 3 min continuous droplets dripping, which could be used to drive a timer for ~ 12 s. Based on the same working mechanism, Chen et al. reported another droplet-based TENG by using laser-induced graphene (LIG) electrodes. 555 By using interfacial laser processing method, the TENG was constructed by in situ growth of fluorine-doped LIG (F-LIG) and LIG electrodes on the top and bottom sides of Liquid-liquid TENG. Superhydrophobic TENGs reduced the effective contact area between Liquid And solid surfaces, compromising energy conversion efficiency. 557 Besides, it is unsuitable for superhydrophobic TENGs to be applied in high humid surroundings and freezing temperature due to the disappearance of the air cushion, followed by the formation of unwanted wetting transition. As a result, charge generation and transport were screened, and the efficiency of energy harvesting was reduced. 558 Xu el al. reported a robust SLIS-based triboelectric nanogenerator and demonstrated charge generation primarily were from the triboelectricity between water and SLIS interface. 557 The as-prepared PTFE layer (Fig. 60a). At a temperature of below 5 °C, water droplet could easily slide off the SLIS-TENG, but the water droplet was pinned on the superhydrophobic surfaces (i.e., SHS-TENG or PTFE-TENG) (Fig. 60b). The SLIS-TENG retained stable output voltage of 1.2 V and could light up bulbs in both room and freezing temperature (-3 °C). However, bulbs could not be lit up on the superhydrophobic surface at -3 °C (Fig. 60c). It is because the formation of ice/frost was delayed or suppressed on SILS-TENG, promoting droplet mobility on its surface and energy generation. However, there were ice crystals formed on PTFE-TENG owing to the disappearance of air pocket, preventing charge separation in the process of triboelectricity. In addition, the effect of scratches on energy generation performance of SLIS-TENG was negligible because of the self-healing property of SLISs. The SLIS-TENG was demonstrated to be robust and durable after 10,000 consecutive water droplets impact, with only 0.4% of lubricant loss.The generation of electric output from freestanding TENGs relied on effective contact area, which was determined by the water spreading and shrinking on the PTFE surface.

        <p>Besides the above-discussed TENGs, electromagnetic induction on liquid-repellent surfaces has also been exploited to construct electricity generators. [559][560][561] As shown in Fig. 61a, Ma et al. proposed a superhydrophobic surface-based magnetoelectric system that could generate electricity from falling water droplets via mechanical-electrical conversion. 559 The system was composed of a superhydrophobic top surface containing a conductive coil, glycerin droplets, and a superhydrophobic magnetic Nd2Fe14B powder/Ecoflex base. Falling water droplets impacted the upper part and rebounded from the superhydrophobic surface, during which the glycerin droplets sandwiched between two superhydrophobic surfaces were compressed to semi-Cassie state and then recovered to Cassie state. The deformation and recovery of the glycerin droplets changed the distance between the coil and the magnetic base, which changed the magnetic flux through the coil and thereby generated electricity. Multiple bouncing of the water droplet on the superhydrophobic surface enabled the magnetic flux passing through the coil to increase/decrease periodically, which resulted in a damping electric performance. When a 50 μL water droplet was released from a height of 10 cm, the first peak current and voltage were 1.2 mA and 19.8 mV, respectively. Afterwards, they developed another superhydrophobic surface-based electricity generator by using water-based ferromagnetic liquid droplet sliding induced magnetic flux change (Fig. 61b). 560 As illustrated in Fig. 61c, upon tilting the superhydrophobic substrate, the ferromagnetic liquid droplet containing randomly distributed Fe3O4 nanoparticles started sliding on the surface and moved onto the magnetic field area, after which the nanoparticles were magnetized and thereby changed the magnetic flux passing through the conductive coil, allowing electricity generation in the coil. After the ferromagnetic liquid droplet rolled away from the magnetic field area, the magnetic flux recovered and electricity generated in the coil again. When a 100 μL ferromagnetic liquid droplet slid on the surface (tilting speed of 9.5° s -1 ) under a 13 mT magnetic field, an electrical response with voltage of 280 μV and current of 7.5 μA were recorded. Similarly, electricity generation under water by using oily magnetic nanofluid droplet sliding on underwater superoleophobic surface has also been reported.Besides the above-discussed TENGs, electromagnetic induction on liquid-repellent surfaces has also been exploited to construct electricity generators.

        <p>Characterisation of wettability is the foundation of research on liquid-repellent surfaces. CA measurement via sessile-drop goniometry is the most general method to evaluate liquid repellence, while CAH and SA have to be well considered since they reflect the mobility of droplets more accurately and directly. The precision/resolution of the goniometer setup and related software need to be further improved. 86,93 Meanwhile, the experimental factors, especially those operator-dependent details (e.g., droplet volume, liquid feeding speed, tangent line/baseline determination methods, etc.), should be normalized and reported in the publications. Meanwhile, adhesive force mapping and solid-liquid/liquid-liquid interface imaging are recommended for the study of liquid repellence from visualized and micro perspectives, such as transition between the Wenzel and Cassie-Baxter states, wetting/de-wetting, lubricant dynamics, etc.Characterisation of wettability is the foundation of research on liquid-repellent surfaces.

        <p>Robustness and durability should be evaluated and targeted according to the specific application scenario of the liquid-repellent surfaces. On the one hand, diverse evaluation methods have been proposed, but it may be unnecessary to test all aspects of the robustness and durability. For example, superhydrophobic self-cleaning roofs of buildings mainly suffer from raindrops, sands, sunlight, acid rain, etc., so the tolerance towards water droplets/falling sands impacting, UV exposure, and acid corrosion need to be addressed firstly, while other testing can be considered secondary. Meanwhile, in order to present repeatable, comparative and reliable evaluation results of robustness and durability, universal testing standards are urgently needed to be unified. On the other hand, the robustness and/or durability of liquid-repellent surfaces cannot be improved one for all. For instance, a lubricant with high surface tension generally imparts SLIS with better durability in heated water immersion, while a lubricant with high viscosity often lowers lubricant depletion but decreases the mobility of droplets on the surface. 389,562 Therefore, the strategies to enhance the robustness and durability should be prudently selected based on their practical service conditions.Robustness and durability should be evaluated and targeted according to the specific application scenario of the liquid-repellent surfaces.

        <p>Undesired liquids mixing, such as continuous discharge of industrial wastewater and domestic sewage, and frequent occurrence of marine oil spillage, poses huge threats to the environment, resources, public health and the economy. For example, according to the statistics by the International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation (ITOPF), there were 181 oil spills of 7 tons and over in the 2000s, resulting in 196,000 tons of oil lost. 518 The Deepwater Horizon accident in 2010 spurted &gt; 50,000 tons of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico, which contaminated approximately 5,000 square kilometers of coastline, killed millions of seabirds and lost hundreds of billions of dollars. Therefore, it is of great significance to remediate these contaminated liquid resources.Undesired liquids mixing, such as continuous discharge of industrial wastewater and domestic sewage, and frequent occurrence of marine oil spillage, poses huge threats to the environment, resources, public health and the economy.

        <p>Flocculant, 519 Fenton catalytic decomposition, 520 and physical separation 447,521 are several typical methods for remediation of mixed immiscible liquids. Among them, physical separation could simultaneously separate and recycle immiscible liquids with little negative environmental impact, enabling this method to be the most promising one. Porous particles, two-dimensional (2D) filters (e.g., metallic meshes, fabrics or membranes) and three-dimensional (3D) monoliths (e.g., sponges, carbon aerogels) are the three most commonly used substrates; however, some of these traditional filters and adsorbents have low separation efficiency, liquid selectivity and reusability. 25,522,523 To separate water from oils or organic liquids with a high separation efficiency, a filter or adsorbent is expected to be preferentially wetted by oil and repel water, or vice versa. A superhydrophobic-oleophilic filter is usually applied for separation of immiscible liquids due to its selective wettability of water and oil/organic solvents. In terms of other types of liquid-repellent surfaces, e.g., superoleophobic surface and SLIS, they repel both water and oil/organic solvents and are not very applicable in the separation of immiscible liquids. In this section, hydrophobic-oleophilic materials will be discussed for immiscible liquids separation, in the forms of particles, 2D filters and 3D monoliths.Flocculant, 519 Fenton catalytic decomposition, 520 and physical separation 447,521 are several typical methods for remediation of mixed immiscible liquids.

        <p>Superhydrophobic and oleophilic powder adsorbents can be effectively applied to remove large-scale oil spills, especially for the treatment of a thin oil film (0.04-50 µm of thickness) that is floating on the water surface. 524 When oil is spilled on sea water, it is easy to manipulate powder-formed oil adsorbents, which only need to be sprinkled on the region of the oil spill. The adsorption process is spontaneous with the aid of waves and tides. To design a high-performance particle adsorbent, three factors are taken into consideration, i.e., surface chemical properties, porosity and the price of raw materials, which may directly affect their selectivity, oil adsorption capacities and extensively practical usage. Dolomite and calcium carbonate are high-efficiency mineral oil adsorbents because of their low cost, high specific surface area, and ready availability. 525,526 However, pristine minerals can be wetted by oils and water at the same time, and thus find it difficult to separate oil and water. It is necessary to modify surface properties to obtain hydrophobicity and oleophilicity. For example, Shen et al. prepared powder-formed superhydrophobic and oleophilic calcium carbonate adsorbents for oil spill clean-ups. 525 After coating with a layer of hydrophobic fatty acid molecules, porous calcium carbonate particles were durable liquid-repellent surfaces should be actively focused on in future research.Superhydrophobic and oleophilic powder adsorbents can be effectively applied to remove large-scale oil spills, especially for the treatment of a thin oil film (0.04-50 µm of thickness) that is floating on the water surface. 524 When oil is spilled on sea water, it is easy to manipulate powder-formed oil adsorbents, which only need to be sprinkled on the region of the oil spill.

        <p>Most of the recent progress in preparing liquid-repellent surfaces with increasing robustness and durability remains outweighed by substantial trade-offs in large-scale feasibility, environmental unfriendliness, and expense or complexity of preparation. To promote the real-world and large-area applications of liquid-repellent surfaces, 563 as well as to power the carbon dioxide emissions peak and carbon neutrality, 564 it is still urgently needed to develop simple, massively scalable, low-cost, and green methods to construct robust and durable liquid-repellent surfaces.Most of the recent progress in preparing liquid-repellent surfaces with increasing robustness and durability remains outweighed by substantial trade-offs in large-scale feasibility, environmental unfriendliness, and expense or complexity of preparation.

        <p>Last but not least, although the emphasis on robustness and durability are continuously increasing in order to move liquid-repellent surfaces towards real-world applications, it has to be noted that the surfaces without robustness and durability are by no means useless. As one of the most typical examples, exposing liquid-repellent surfaces to plasma or UV can sometimes trigger chemical instability and thus damage the liquid repellence, but it is widely employed in creating patterned liquid-repellent surfaces, 565,566 stimuli-responsive smart surfaces, 567,568 materials with Janus wettability, 569 etc.Last but not least, although the emphasis on robustness and durability are continuously increasing in order to move liquid-repellent surfaces towards real-world applications, it has to be noted that the surfaces without robustness and durability are by no means useless.
