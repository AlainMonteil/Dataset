        <p>Herein, we report hierarchical 3D NiMn-layered double hydroxide (NiMn-LDHs) shells grown on conductive silver nanowire (Ag NWs) cores as efficient, low-cost, and durable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) bifunctional electrocatalysts for metal-air batteries. The hierarchical 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDH catalysts exhibit superb OER/ ORR activities in alkaline conditions. The outstanding bifunctional activities of Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs are essentially attributed to increasing both site activity and site populations. The synergistic contributions from the hierarchical 3D open-pore structure of the LDH shells, improved electrical conductivity, and small thickness of the LDHs shells are associated with more accessible site populations. Moreover, the charge transfer between Ag cores and metals of LDH shells and the formation of defective and distorted sites (less coordinated Ni and Mn sites) strongly enhance the site activity. Thus, Ag NW@NiMn-LDH hybrids exhibit a 0.75 V overvoltage difference between ORR and OER with excellent durability for 30 h, demonstrating the distinguished bifunctional electrocatalyst reported to date. Interestingly, the homemade rechargeable Zn-air battery using the hybrid Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs (1:2) catalyst as the air electrode exhibits a charge-discharge voltage gap of ∼0.77 V at 10 mA cm -2 and shows excellent cycling stability. Thus, the concept of the hierarchical 3D architecture of Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs considerably advances the practice of LDHs toward metal-air batteries and oxygen electrocatalysts.Herein, we report hierarchical 3D NiMn-layered double hydroxide (NiMn-LDHs) shells grown on conductive silver nanowire (Ag NWs) cores as efficient, low-cost, and durable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) bifunctional electrocatalysts for metal-air batteries.

        <p>The energy storage capacity of a Zn-air battery is rigorously constrained by the sluggish kinetics of the OER/ORR since both require four-proton and four-electron transfers to produce/reduce oxygen molecules. The slow process of ORR/OER leads to high overpotential, low efficiency, and considerable energy loss of the devices. 4,5 As a result, to improve energy efficiency and minimize the energy barrier, highly efficient and resourceful OER/ORR catalysts are required. The preeminent catalyst known to date for ORR is Pt-based material, while IrO 2 and RuO 2 are the OER benchmark catalysts. 3,6 However, their sources are not sustainable and are expensive, and consequently inappropriate for large-scale applications. Extensive research endeavors have been thus committed to the development of economically pleasing OER and ORR electrocatalysts including oxides of transition metals, 2,7 perovskites, 8 carbon materials, 9 layered double hydroxides (LDHs), 10 nickel borate composites, 11,12 and cobalt phosphate composites. 13,14 Among them, Ni-based oxides or hydroxides appear as efficient OER catalysts due to their ease of scalability and abundant source. 7 Although many of them are OER active in alkaline conditions, they are ORR inactive.The energy storage capacity of a Zn-air battery is rigorously constrained by the sluggish kinetics of the OER/ORR since both require four-proton and four-electron transfers to produce/reduce oxygen molecules.

        <p>Specifically, the OER activity of NiFe-LDHs is promising and exceeds the activity of Ir/C and IrO 2 catalysts. Nevertheless, the intrinsically poor electrical conductivity of LDHs and easily degradable active sites due to material stacking greatly prevent them from replacing precious metal electrocatalysts. One fruitful strategy for improvement is to integrate LDHs with highly conductive substrates such as carbon nanotubes, graphene oxide, and conductive metal. [15][16][17] NiFe-LDHs with highly conductive matrices (e.g. reduced graphene oxide 18,19 and carbon nanotubes 20 ) have been extensively scrutinized, and the OER activity is superior to known noble metal catalysts (e.g., IrO 2 and RuO 2 20 ), which are crucial components for several energy conversion and storage processes. 21 While incorporating other transition metal species or conductive material might offer better activities of OER, 20,22,23 their ORR activity is less studied so far. 24 Inspired by excellent electrical conductivity and the enormous surface area of Ag nanowires (NWs) and the electronically active character of Mn and Ni atoms, it is believed that the composite of Ag NWs cores and NiMn-LDHs shells can be a promising electrocatalyst for OER and ORR activities. Herein, we have intended and successfully developed hierarchical 3D architecture NiMn-LDHs nanosheet shells grown on highly conductive Ag NWs cores, denoted as Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs. The hierarchical 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDH hybrids exhibited marvelous activity with an OER onset overpotential of 0.19 and 0.27 V for ORR, which is superior to the performance of most nickel-based catalysts reported so far. The obtained Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs electrocatalyst has been tested for a rechargeable Zn-air battery and shows excellent performance.Specifically, the OER activity of NiFe-LDHs is promising and exceeds the activity of Ir/C and IrO 2 catalysts.

        <p>Figure 1a demonstrates a schematic diagram of the fabrication process of hierarchical 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs via the facile hydrothermal approach. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (Figure 1b and the inset) reveals that the as-synthesized 1D Ag NWs have a uniform length, which can facilitate LDH coating. As illustrated in Figure S1a,b, the SEM images of the as-prepared pristine NiMn-LDHs reveal flower-like interconnected nanosheets and a porous morphology. These nanosheets have minimal selfaggregation and an open structure, which is advantageous for increasing the site populations of the catalytic reactions. The morphology and core-shell nanostructure of the Ag NW@ NiMn-LDHs revealed by SEM clearly show that the hierarchical NiMn-LDHs architecture is composed of curved nanosheets vertically grown on the surface of conductive Ag NWs cores uniformly after hydrothermal reaction (Figure 1c, the inset in 1c, and Figure S1c,d). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) integrated with SEM presented in Figure S2 confirmed that the molar ratio of Ni/Mn in NiMn-LDHs is 3:1 and Ag/M (M = Ni,Mn) is 1:2 for the hybrid Ag NW@ NiMn-LDHs(1:2) core-shell, which is close to the feeding ratio in the preparation.Figure 1a demonstrates a schematic diagram of the fabrication process of hierarchical 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs via the facile hydrothermal approach.

        <p>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and highresolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) further confirm the core-shell hierarchical structure of Ag NW@NiMn-LDH hybrids (Figure 2a). From the HR-TEM image (Figure 2b), the thickness of the LDH shell is determined to be ∼4.3 to 5.2 nm. A single layer of LDHs has a thickness of 0.8 nm, and our Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2) has about 5 to 6 layers. Such a 3D architecture of a core-shell nanostructure with a few-layer hierarchical LDH shell would be anticipated to maximize the surface area and enable more active edge sites to be exposed, thus promoting the catalytic activity. A distinctive lattice fringe with an interplanar spacing of 0.26 nm (Figure 2c) was also identified, which can be assigned to the (012) plane of NiMn-LDHs. The electron diffraction patterns shown in Figure 2d clearly displayed the Debye-Scherrer rings, which can be indexed to the 003, 006, and 012 planes of LDHs. In addition, energy-dispersive X-ray measurement (EDX) elemental mapping (Figure 2e and Figure S3) shows that Ni and Mn elements are uniformly dispersed on the surface of Ag cores and entirely overlapped on one another. These results demonstrate that Ag nanowire cores are successfully embedded with NiMn-LDH shells to form a hierarchical 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs hybrid.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and highresolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) further confirm the core-shell hierarchical structure of Ag NW@NiMn-LDH hybrids (Figure 2a).

        <p>The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Ag NW@NiMn-LDH hybrids were indexed, and the crystal planes of all diffraction peaks corresponding to the typical layered structure of hydrotalcite-like materials and the superimposition of Ag NWs and NiMn-LDHs patterns were also observed (Figure 2f and Figure S4a). This indicates that the integration of NiMn-LDHs shells and the inner Ag NWs compositions was attained with high purity and crystallinity. The XRD patterns of Ag NW@NiMn-LDH hybrids showed slightly different d-spacing for crystal planes of ( 003) and (006) as the ratios of metal salts and Ag NWs varied from 1:1 to 1:4 (Figure S4b and Table S1). In addition, the thickness of the shells was estimated from the peak width of (003) and (006) crystal planes, which is ∼3.21 nm for Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2), lower than the estimated values of pristine NiMn-LDHs (∼3.75 nm). A single layer of LDHs has a thickness of 0.8 nm, and our Ag NW@ NiMn-LDHs(1:2) has about 4 layers, while the pristine NiMn-LDHs has around 5 layers. The small thickness of LDHs shells would be anticipated to favor better OH -/O 2 transport through the core-shell hybrids and increase accessible site populations.The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Ag NW@NiMn-LDH hybrids were indexed, and the crystal planes of all diffraction peaks corresponding to the typical layered structure of hydrotalcite-like materials and the superimposition of Ag NWs and NiMn-LDHs patterns were also observed (Figure 2f and Figure S4a).

        <p>The N 2 -adsorption-desorption measurements were employed to understand the structure, surface area, and pore sizes of the hierarchical 3D architecture of Ag NW@NiMn-LDH hybrids. As shown in Figure S5a, the hysteresis loops of the measured N 2 isotherms at the relative pressure (P/P 0 &gt; 0.4) indicate the adsorption-desorption processes of porous materials. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of the hierarchical 3D nanostructure of Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2) is 162.4 m 2 g -1 , higher than that of Ag NW@ NiMn-LDHs(1:4) (148.3 m 2 g -1 ) and pristine NiMn-LDHs (61.8 m 2 g -1 ). The growth of the vertically oriented hierarchical nanostructure of LDH shells on the surface of silver nanowires with less structural restacking and open-pore structure is beneficial to offer a high surface area of the hybrids. Such a high surface area and hierarchical 3D nanostructure of Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2) would provide more accessible active sites for the electrocatalytic process. The Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution obtained from the N 2 desorption reveal the hierarchical structure of the fabricated hybrid materials with pore diameters in the range between 5 and 20 nm (Figure S5b). The pore size distribution of pristine NiMn-LDHs is relatively wider than other samples.The N 2 -adsorption-desorption measurements were employed to understand the structure, surface area, and pore sizes of the hierarchical 3D architecture of Ag NW@NiMn-LDH hybrids.

        <p>FT-IR spectra (Figure S6) reveal that anions such as OH -, H 2 O molecules, and CO 3 2-anions are fully intercalated between the interlayer galleries of NiMn-LDHs and the hybrid Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs. The Raman spectrum of NiMn-LDHs displays an intense peak at 553 cm -1 (Figure S7a). This band is attributed to the symmetric stretching vibration of MO bonds. Upon the formation of the hierarchical 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs hybrid, three bands are observed in this region, at 464, 544, and 603 cm -1 . The underlying bands centered at 464 cm -1 and at ∼544 cm -1 are attributed to disordered or defected Ni(OH) 2 . An intense peak detected at 603 cm -1 for Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs is attributed to the vibrational stretching mode of MnOOH. 25 The Raman shift at 3635 cm -1 is attributed to the -OH stretching of Ni(OH) 2 in the LDHs' surface (Figure S7b). This band can be also observed for Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs at 3650 cm -1 . This shift of -OH stretching to higher wavenumber for the Ag NW@ NiMn-LDHs hybrid is again due to the different structural environment. In the previous studies, bands in these positions were identified as the vibrational stretching mode of -OH groups. 26,27 The wide-range survey X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of the as-prepared Ag NWs confirms the presence of Ag, C (for calibration), and O atoms (Figure S8). Ni, Mn, and O elements were detected in a wide-range survey of NiMn-LDHs. The overall survey XPS spectrum of the hierarchical 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDH hybrids (Figure S8) clearly confirms the existence of Mn, Ni, Ag, C (for calibration), and O elements. The XPS data of bare Ag NWs (Figure 3a) present two main peaks at 367.3 and 373.3 eV, corresponding to Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 , respectively, indicating the typical peak of elemental Ag. 28 However, when it is core-shelled with NiMn-LDHs, the intensity of the Ag 3d peaks became very weak and broad along with a shift in peak position, confirming that the Ag NWs were well-confined within NiMn-LDHs shells. Further increasing the ratio of metal salts considerably diminished the intensity of the Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 peaks. In addition to the influence of dominant LDHs covered on the Ag surface, the electron escape depth in XPS is another cause for the weak signal because the technique has a limited penetration depth of several nanometers. 29 Thus, NiMn-LDHs dominates the surface and the binding energy shift might be due to the strong interaction of Ag cores and metal LDHs shells as a result of charge transfer. The Ni 2p spectrum of NiMn-LDHs (Figure 3b) shows two shakeup satellites and two main peaks found at 873.5 and 855.9 eV core levels, attributed to Ni 2p 1/2 and Ni 2p 3/2 , respectively, indicating the existence of a high-spin Ni 2+ oxidation state and about 0.3-0.7 eV higher than Ni 2p of Ag NW@NiMn-LDH hybrids. The binding energy of Mn 2p for NiMn-LDHs is 642.3 and 653.2 eV, analogous to Mn 2p 3/2 and Mn 2p 1/2 , respectively, indicating the existence of Mn 3+ and about 0.4 eV lower than the Ag NW@NiMn-LDH hybrids (Figure 3c). The O 1s spectrum of β-Ni(OH) 2 (Figure S9) displays three distinct peaks, whereas pristine NiMn-LDHs and the Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs hybrid show four oxygen contributions. The additional peak at 530.5 eV in both NiMn-LDHs and the Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs hybrid is related to the defected oxygen atoms. 30 Thus, the XPS analysis reveals that there is a firm interaction in the electronic structure between the Ag nanowire core and metal LDH shells in the hierarchical Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs hybrids. Accordingly, the hierarchical 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs hybrid exhibited better electron transfer when the ratio of Ag nanowires and NiMn-LDHs was 1:2, which is beneficial to promote the site activity of the catalyst. D. Zhou et al. 31 found that electron-rich metal sites (Ni or Fe) increase OER activity. Accordingly, as a result of the electron transfer effect of Ag cores with metal LDHs shells, the hierarchical 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDH hybrids can act as an efficient candidate for oxygen electrocatalysis.FT-IR spectra (Figure S6) reveal that anions such as OH -, H 2 O molecules, and CO 3 2-anions are fully intercalated between the interlayer galleries of NiMn-LDHs and the hybrid Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs.

        <p>X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was employed to investigate local structure atoms and the coordination nature of surface metals. The pre-edge peaks resulted from a 1s → 3d electric-quadrupole transition of around 8333.5 eV, and main absorption peaks at about 8350 eV due to the dipole electronic transition of 1s → 4p orbitals were obtained for the Ni K-edge (Figure 4a). The main absorption peak of the Ni K-edge for Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs slightly shifted to a lower position (inset in Figure 4a), suggesting the interaction between Ag NW cores and LDH shells. Figure 4b presents Mn K-edge XANES spectra of NiMn-LDHs, Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs, and commercial MnO, MnO 2 , and Mn 2 O 3 for comparison. XANES spectra of the Mn K-edge of the as-prepared Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs shifted to higher energy with reduced intensity when compared with the as-prepared NiMn-LDHs precursor, demonstrating a change in electronic structure and coordination numbers of the Mn species in Ag NW@NiMn-LDH hybrids.X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was employed to investigate local structure atoms and the coordination nature of surface metals. The pre-edge peaks resulted from a 1s → 3d electric-quadrupole transition of around 8333.5 eV, and main absorption peaks at about 8350 eV due to the dipole electronic transition of 1s → 4p orbitals were obtained for the Ni K-edge (Figure 4a). The main absorption peak of the Ni K-edge for Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs slightly shifted to a lower position (inset in Figure 4a), suggesting the interaction between Ag NW cores and LDH shells.

        <p>Evidently, Mn K-edge XANES spectra display a weak preedge feature at around 6540.6 eV due to low-symmetry distortion of mixed allowed transitions through 4p → 3d, and an intense main edge feature at around 6551 eV arising from electric dipole transitions of 1s → 4p suggests the formal valence state of Mn 3+ in NiMn-LDHs, consistent with XPS results and a previous report of Mn K-edge. 32,33 Although the energy of the pre-edge peak of the Mn K-edge of Ag NW@ NiMn-LDHs is nearly equivalent to NiMn-LDHs, the energy of the main-edge peak shifted to higher position (inset in Figure 4b) along with a sharp decrease in the intensity, attributed to the higher oxidation state of Mn and alteration of the electronic structure around the Mn atoms in Ag NW@ NiMn-LDHs. The corresponding Ni K-edge and Mn K-edge k 2 χ(k) oscillation curves (Figure S10) of the NiMn-LDHs and Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs core-shell show a reduced amplitude of oscillation curves relative to β-Ni(OH) 2 for Ni K-edge and commercial MnO, MnO 2 , and Mn 2 O 3 for the Mn K-edge. These signalize the structural alteration in the coordination sphere of Ni and Mn atoms. The fitting analysis of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data is summarized in Figure 4c,d. As shown in Figure 4c, the peak at 1.80 Å in radial distribution function of the Ni K-edge is assigned to Ni-O coordination, and the peaks at around 3.00 Å are associated with Ni-M (M = Ni, Mn) coordination peaks. The decreased intensity of these coordination spheres relative to β-Ni(OH) 2 suggests a decrease in average coordination number (N) of Ni-O and Ni-M shells in both NiMn-LDHs and Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs along with the size reduction. Thus, compared to the average coordination number of Ni-O (N = 6.00) and Ni-Ni (N = 6.00) in β-Ni(OH) 2 (Table S2), the NiMn-LDHs exhibit a noticeable decrease in coordination number around the coordination sphere of Ni-M (N = 5.77), suggesting the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Ni sites. Similarly, the average coordination numbers of Ni-O (N = 5.78) and Ni-M (N = 5.69) coordination spheres also decrease in hierarchical 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDH hybrids. This information describes the presence of oxygen vacancies and coordinatively unsaturated Ni sites in both NiMn-LDHs and Ag NW@NiMn-LDH hybrids. Furthermore, the intensity of Mn-O coordination spheres of Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs is significantly reduced relative to the pristine NiMn-LDHs (Figure 4d and Table S3), suggesting that further increased coordinatively unsaturated Mn sites and Mn atoms exposed on the surface of NiMn-LDHs are partially saturated with O atoms. In fact, coordinatively unsaturated metal atoms cause structural distortion and defects that can tune the electronic properties and enhance the site activity of the catalyst. Therefore, the presence of coordinatively unsaturated metal sites causes vacancy defects and engineer disorder that could greatly affect the electronic structure of the hierarchical 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDH hybrids, which in turn plays a significant role in tuning the catalytic properties of the active sites and hence attaining improved catalytic activities.Evidently, Mn K-edge XANES spectra display a weak preedge feature at around 6540.6 eV due to low-symmetry distortion of mixed allowed transitions through 4p → 3d, and an intense main edge feature at around 6551 eV arising from electric dipole transitions of 1s → 4p suggests the formal valence state of Mn 3+ in NiMn-LDHs, consistent with XPS results and a previous report of Mn K-edge. 32,33 Although the energy of the pre-edge peak of the Mn K-edge of Ag NW@ NiMn-LDHs is nearly equivalent to NiMn-LDHs, the energy of the main-edge peak shifted to higher position (inset in Figure 4b) along with a sharp decrease in the intensity, attributed to the higher oxidation state of Mn and alteration of the electronic structure around the Mn atoms in Ag NW@ NiMn-LDHs.

        <p>The electrocatalytic properties of the hierarchical 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDH hybrids along with the pristine NiMn-LDHs and commercial IrO 2 and Pt/C with respect to OER were first assessed using the usual threeelectrode method in 1 M KOH aqueous solution (70 μg cm -2 catalyst loading was used for all samples). The polarization curves in Figure 5a and Figure S11 show that the hierarchical 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDH hybrids exhibit a much higher OER activity with a lower onset potential than the pristine NiMn-LDHs and commercial IrO 2 and Pt/C. This could be due to the strong coupling effect between the Ag NW core and LDH shells and exposed accessible coordinatively unsaturated Ni and Mn sites. Furthermore, the more accessible Ni sites resulting from the hierarchical open-channel structure of the LDH shells in the 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs boosted the OER activity, as evidenced by a higher Ni 2+/3+ redox peak area. Moreover, the intimate connection between Ag NW cores and NiMn-LDH shells could enable electron transfer and induce a strong synergistic effect for the OER. To further reveal the effect of LDH shells grown on the conductive Ag NW cores, a series of electrochemical measurements were carried out on Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs core-shell nanosheets with various LDH ratios (from 1:1 to 1:4), while keeping the amount of Ag NWs constant. As shown in Figure 5a and Figure S11, the OER onset overpotentials of Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2), Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:4), Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:1), NiMn-LDHs, and commercial IrO 2 and Pt/C were 0.19, 0.20, 0.22, 0.25, 0.26, and 0.29 V versus RHE, respectively. The hierarchical 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2) core-shell nanosheets show a pronounced OER catalytic activity with an earliest onset overpotential of 0.19 V. Specifically, the hierarchical 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2) core-shell electrode yields current densities of 10 and 25 mA cm -2 at an applied overpotential of 270 and 320 mV, respectively. In contrast, the prominent ORR electrocatalyst Pt/C exhibits very poor OER performance without reaching 10 mA cm -2 up to 1.665 V. Thus, our hierarchical 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2) hybrid stands out as vastly an active electrocatalyst for OER.The electrocatalytic properties of the hierarchical 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDH hybrids along with the pristine NiMn-LDHs and commercial IrO 2 and Pt/C with respect to OER were first assessed using the usual threeelectrode method in 1 M KOH aqueous solution (70 μg cm -2 catalyst loading was used for all samples).

        <p>In addition, the OER activity of the hybrid catalysts and pristine NiMn-LDHs was evaluated by scanning from high to low potentials at a scan rate of 1 mV/s as shown in Figure S12. Similar to the OER polarization curves obtained from low to high potentials, the OER activity of the hierarchical 3D nanostructure of the Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2) hybrid is better than its counterparts. The cathodic waves found between ∼1.2 and 1.3 V are attributed to the transformation of the Ni 3+ to Ni 2+ redox couple under this condition. The distinct anodic and cathodic peaks could be due to the site activity and site population differences of the hybrid catalysts resulting from the electronic/structural differences of the Ni sites.In addition, the OER activity of the hybrid catalysts and pristine NiMn-LDHs was evaluated by scanning from high to low potentials at a scan rate of 1 mV/s as shown in Figure S12.

        <p>The electrochemical ORR activity of the as-prepared samples was assessed in 1 M KOH aqueous solution using a three-electrode system. The relative cyclic voltammetry (CV) of both O 2 -and Ar-saturated 1 M KOH electrolyte at a scan rate of 50 mV s -1 was recorded as shown in Figure S13. The Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs core-shell exhibited a featureless CV curve in Ar-saturated aqueous solution, whereas a noticeable cathodic peak appeared at about +0.95 V after being saturated with O 2 gas, signifying tremendous ORR activity. To compare and further scrutinize the roles of Ag NW and LDH composition on ORR activity, the LSVs of NiMn-LDHs, Ag NWs, Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:1), Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:4), Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2), and Pt/C were executed as shown in Figure 5b. Accordingly, the ORR activity of the hierarchical Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2) core-shell is superior relative to the counterparts. The half-wave potential and onset potential of Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2) were 0.75 and 0.96 V, respectively, which are closer to the Pt/C catalyst (0.83 and 0.98 V) and essentially more positive than Ag NW@ NiMn-LDHs(1:4) (0.70 and 0.93 V), Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:1) (0.62 and 0.87 V), and Ag NWs (0.56 and 0.85 V). This result suggests that coating the surface of conductive Ag NWs cores with NiMn-LDHs shells at an appropriate level can efficiently enhance electrochemical activity. An excess of LDHs leads to a decrease of the electrocatalytic activity, which might be a result of the dense packing of LDHs on the conductive Ag NWs, which hinders charge transfer and reduces accessible site populations. Similarly, the hybrid Ag NW@ NiMn-LDHs(1:1) shows low ORR activity as compared to Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2). These suggest that the LDH shells have a detrimental effect on ORR activity, and when it is not entirely embedded on Ag nanowires, the OH adsorption easily accesses the inner Ag sites, which in turn reduces the accessible site populations. Thus, the higher ORR activity of the hierarchical 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2) hybrid is likely due to the synergetic effect between the optimal ratio of Ag and metal LDHs.The electrochemical ORR activity of the as-prepared samples was assessed in 1 M KOH aqueous solution using a three-electrode system.

        <p>To further investigate the electrochemical kinetics and number of transferring electrons (n), the rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements were implemented at different rotation speeds (100-2500 rpm) during the ORR process. Accordingly, the polarization curves and the corresponding Koutecky-Levich plots are shown in Figure S14.

The variation in the number of electron transfers suggested that the hierarchical 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2) is substantially more electro-active and selective than its counterparts and exhibits almost the same features as the ORR benchmark catalyst. These results suggest that there is an optimal ratio between NiMn-LDHs and Ag nanowires for the best catalytic performance.To further investigate the electrochemical kinetics and number of transferring electrons (n), the rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements were implemented at different rotation speeds (100-2500 rpm) during the ORR process.

        <p>Furthermore, the ORR/OER Tafel slopes of each sample are displayed in Figure 5c,d. The OER Tafel slopes of Ag NW@ NiMn-LDHs(1:2), Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:4), Ag NW@ NiMn-LDHs(1:1), NiMn-LDHs, and Pt/C were 40.2, 48.3, 52.4, 65.8, and 132.2 mV dec -1 , respectively, whereas the ORR Tafel slopes were 34.5, 38.9, 46, 48, and 67 mV dec -1 for Pt/C, Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2), Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:4), Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:1), and Ag NWs, respectively. Evidently, the OER/ORR Tafel slope of Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2) is much lower than the counterparts. Thus, the lower Tafel slope of the hierarchical 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2) hybrid implies more favorable ORR/OER kinetics.Furthermore, the ORR/OER Tafel slopes of each sample are displayed in Figure 5c,d.

        <p>We further note the performances of Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst, as illustrated in Figure 6a. For comparison, Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:4), Ag NW@NiMn-LDH(1:1), and commercial IrO 2 and Pt/C were used as the counterparts in a 1 M KOH aqueous solution. Although the ORR activity of Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2) is inferior to the commercial Pt/C, the comparatively low onset overpotential indicated that the coupling effect between Ag NWs and LDHs enhanced the site activity of the catalyst toward ORR. Furthermore, Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2) has an outstanding potential difference (ΔE) between the OER overpotential at the current density of 10 mA cm -2 and the ORR half-wave overpotential at the current density of -3 mA cm -2 when compared with the reported literature so far (Figure 6b). While in 2015 a Ni-based trinary LDH electrocatalyst exhibited a potential difference of 1.05 V, 34 our hierarchical 3D Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2) core-shell architecture reached a value of 0.75 V and thus signifies the most efficient OER/ORR bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst reported to date (Table S6). The OER overpotentials at the current density of 10 mA cm -2 of our hierarchical Ag NW@ NiMn-LDHs core-shell architecture and certain previously reported literature are also compared, as shown in Figure 6c. Accordingly, the Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2) hybrid exhibited the lowest OER overpotential at the current density of 10 mA cm -2 , further revealing superior OER activity. These results suggest that the hierarchical 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs could serve as an efficient and nonprecious metal bifunctional electrocatalyst toward OER/ORR. Such highly active OER/ORR activities of the hierarchical 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs is essentially due to the supported conductive Ag NWs, since NiMn-LDHs itself had poor conductivity and a sluggish OER activity, with a Tafel slope of 65.8 mV dec -1 and high onset overpotential of 250 mV. Nevertheless, Ag NWs played a key role in improving both the OER and ORR activity of Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs relative to unsupported NiMn-LDHs. First, Ag NWs imparted high conductivity to the Ag NW@NiMn-LDH hybrids. According to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (Figure S15) and 4-point probe (Table S4) results, the pristine NiMn-LDHs suffered from low conductivity. The smaller semicircle evidenced in the Nyquist plot for Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs confirmed its reduced resistance compared to the pristine NiMn-LDHs (i.e., improved conductivity), thus benefiting the dispersion of LDH nanosheets and electron transfer.We further note the performances of Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst, as illustrated in Figure 6a.

        <p>To understand the reason behind the superb bifunctional activity of Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs toward ORR and OER activities, the electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) of Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2), Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:4), and NiMn-LDHs were acquired from CV curves in 1 M KOH electrolyte (Figure S16). By plotting the current density at 0.71 V versus RHE against the scan rate, the double-layer capacitance (C dl ) equivalent to half of the average absolute value of the linear slope was obtained and is usually denoted as the ECSA. [35][36][37][38] The calculated C dl , which represents the ECSA, as illustrated in Figure S16, of Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2) had an ECSA two times larger than that of Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:4) and about six times larger than that of the pristine NiMn-LDHs. The substantial enhancement in ECSA value of the 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs can be ascribed to the open-channel hierarchical structure of NiMn-LDHs shells on the surface of Ag NWs cores. Besides improving the conductivity of the hybrids, the presence of Ag NWs also enhances the dispersion and prevents structural restacking of the LDHs, and a few layers of LDHs shells jointly offers a large ECSA. Thus, the higher effective ECSA or accessible site populations of the hierarchical Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2) at the same catalyst loading contributed to the higher activity relative to Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:4) and the pristine LDHs.To understand the reason behind the superb bifunctional activity of Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs toward ORR and OER activities, the electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) of Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2), Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:4), and NiMn-LDHs were acquired from CV curves in 1 M KOH electrolyte (Figure S16).

Thus, the higher effective ECSA or accessible site populations of the hierarchical Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2) at the same catalyst loading contributed to the higher activity relative to Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:4) and the pristine LDHs.</p>
        <p>The durability of the electrocatalytic electrode is another key and serious matter when considering the catalyst for applications. As displayed in Figure 6d, the Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2) hybrid showed excellent durability for 27.5 h at an overpotential of 270 mV, corresponding to 10 mA cm -2 for OER and 480 mV for ORR. Simultaneously, the hierarchical 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2) hybrid exhibits excellent durability (6% activity decay after 17 h) at an overpotential corresponding to the current density of 25 mA cm -2 , suggesting the Ag NW@NiMn-LDH hybrid has excellent stability for water oxidation. The durability test was also conducted for pristine NiMn-LDHs at an overpotential of 330 mV, and the material lost 15% of its activity after 14 h. The quick deterioration in current density is essentially due to blockage of several active sites of the catalyst by the accumulation of evolved O 2 bubbles. Furthermore, the hybrid Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2) exhibited excellent cyclic stability up to 4000 cycles in 1 M KOH at a scan rate of 50 mV/s (Figure S17). It was noticeable that the tight interaction and the electronic effect between the hierarchical 3D structure of LDH shells and conductive Ag NW cores stabilize the structure. Furthermore, the exposure of more accessible active sites results from the hierarchical 3D open-pore structure of LDHs, and the presence of Ag NWs helps to prevent the structural restacking of LDH nanosheets, which makes the structure of the hybrid more stable. To rationalize the structural stability of the hierarchical 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2) catalyst after a long-term stability test during the OER and ORR, XPS spectra were acquired and are shown in Figure S18. The XPS spectra reveal that Ag 3d, Ni 2p, and Mn 2p peaks shifted to higher binding energy after a long-term stability test, indicating the presence of a high valence state. This result means that all the electronic states of Ni, Mn, and Ag sites in the Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs(1:2) hybrid have been changed greatly after the long-term stability test. Therefore, the XPS data show that Ni, Mn, and Ag sites were involved in the electrochemical reactions, which will be beneficial for the synergetic effect and would be responsible for the excellent bifunctional performance of the Ag NW@ NiMn-LDHs hybrid. Moreover, the morphology and crystal-linity of the hierarchical 3D nanostructure of the Ag NW@ NiMn-LDHs(1:2) hybrid were evaluated after a 12 h stability test during the OER using TEM and HR-TEM. As shown in Figure S19a-c, the morphology and crystallinity of the Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs core-shell are well preserved. The EDS mapping images (Figure S19d,e) identified the typical coreshell nanostructure of the Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs hybrid, which clearly shows that Ni and Mn atoms are homogeneously distributed on the surface of the Ag nanowires. The electron diffraction patterns (Figure S19f) show the same situation after the stability test as the initial state. Thus, the TEM and HR-TEM images of the hybrid catalyst reveal that there is no structural and phase change after a long-time stability test, and the hierarchical 3D nanostructure of Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs core-shell is well maintained.The durability of the electrocatalytic electrode is another key and serious matter when considering the catalyst for applications.

        <p>To get some deep insight into the effect of defects on catalytic performance, density of states (DOS) were computed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The model of NiMn-LDHs is illustrated in Figure S20a, where the atomic ratio of Ni/Mn is 3:1 and CO 3 2-is the intercalated anion. As shown in Figure S20b, the defect-free NiMn-LDHs is semiconducting with a noticeable band gap near the Fermi level in both spin-up and spin-down states, while the oxidation states of Ni and Mn can be confirmed as 2+ (3d 8 ) and 3+ (3d 4 ), respectively, according to their electron configuration. As shown in Figure S20c,d and Figure S21a-d, the DOS were also computed for defected NiMn-LDHs with the oxygen vacancies near Ni and Mn sites. As a result, the integral partial DOS (PDOS) of Ni-3d and Mn-3d were estimated for defectfree and defected NiMn-LDHs (Table S5). Accordingly, when the oxygen vacancy was created on the Mn site, the resultant densities of electrons for occupied states in Ni and Mn sites are 0.08 and 0.19 e -/atom, respectively. However, when the oxygen vacancy is created on the Ni site, the resultant densities of electrons for occupied states in Ni and Mn sites are 0.59 and -0.08 e -/atom, respectively. The integrated PDOS clearly shows that when an oxygen vacancy is created on the Mn site, the electron density for an occupied state of the Mn site is more positive relative to the Ni sites, suggesting that the deficiency of electron density surrounding the Mn site is more favorable. The calculations properly explain the electronic properties in the XPS results, and the defect surrounding the Mn site in NiMn-LDHs is also consistent with the XAS results. As a result, the hybridization of defective Ni-3d and Mn-3d with 2p states of O would result in a much stronger O adsorption, which intrinsically enhances the OER activity of NiMn-LDHs. On the other hand, the presence of defects lowers the band gap and improves the electric conductivity of NiMn-LDHs, which is promising for high-performance electrocatalysts.To get some deep insight into the effect of defects on catalytic performance, density of states (DOS) were computed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Thus, the electronic effect between Ag NW core and metals in an LDH shell has tuned the site activity and synergistically promoted the ORR/OER activity. The superb OER activity of the hierarchical 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDH hybrids resulted from the synergistically hierarchical 3D open-pore structure of the LDH shells, conductivity improvement, and small thickness of LDH shells jointly associated with the OER site populations.The hierarchical 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDH hybrids are representatively used as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst toward the OER and ORR.

        <p>In summary, 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDH hybrids have been developed as an efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst, consisting of highly conductive silver nanowires in the core decorated with hierarchical NiMn-LDHs as the shell. Both the OER and the ORR activities of the hierarchical 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs can be modified by varying the LDH shells. The preeminent bifunctional activity and durability of the nanostructured oxygen electrocatalysts for the reversible ORR/OER in basic electrolyte were achieved by hierarchical Ag NW and NiMn-LDH nanosheets (1:2), when compared to the state-of-the-art Pt/C and IrO 2 . Thus, the strong coupling effect between the hierarchical 3D open-pore structure of LDHs and Ag NWs, a few layers of LDHs shells, and improved conductivity are mutually associated with the accessible site populations and synergistically enhanced the ORR/OER activities of Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs. Furthermore, the coordinatively unsaturated active metal centers exposed on the surface causes defects of active metal centers and engineering structural distortion relevant to the site activity, which in turn dictates active sites for the improved OER/ORR bifunctional activities. The coupled electronic interaction and structural disorder further change the intrinsic catalytic activity of individual active site. Thus, the resultant synergies between conductive Ag NW cores and the hierarchical 3D open-pore structure of LDHs shells of Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs boosted the bifunctional ORR/OER activities and durability. Therefore, the proposed strategy of a core-shell hierarchical 3D architecture of LDHs with a conductive nanomaterial proves to be effective in creating highly active, resourceful, and durable heterogeneous catalysts.In summary, 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDH hybrids have been developed as an efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst, consisting of highly conductive silver nanowires in the core decorated with hierarchical NiMn-LDHs as the shell.
