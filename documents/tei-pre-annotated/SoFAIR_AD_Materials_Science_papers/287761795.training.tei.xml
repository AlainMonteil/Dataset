        <p>Liposomes are closed vesicles with bilayer structure that is formed by dispersing amphipathic molecule, such as phospholipid, into water. Due to the hydrophobic tail and the hydrophilic head section, these tails tend to aggregate to avoid contacting with water and these heads are likely to expose to water [1]. The special bilayer structure makes these carriers can load hydrophilic drug in the internal water phase and the hydrophobic drug in the bilayer.Liposomes are closed vesicles with bilayer structure that is formed by dispersing amphipathic molecule, such as phospholipid, into water.

        <p>In the early stage (1960), liposomes were regarded as a research model of cell membrane, while nowadays they are mainly used as drug carriers to deliver proteins, growth factors and other chemical drugs. As drug delivery carriers, liposomes have various advantages, such as (1) passive targeting via enhanced permeability and retention effect in tumor area, (2) excellent ability in controlling drug release, (3) decreased drug side effects, and (4) improved drug stability, which make them effective in delivering drugs, vaccines, imaging, cosmetics, etc. [2]. However, liposomes have also drawbacks that limit their clinical applications, such as (1) challenges in transporting liquid formulation, (2) insufficient mechanical properties, and (3) inability to maintain certain drug concentration in the local area. Therefore, certain improvements are needed to offer more suitable liposomes for clinical applications.In the early stage (1960), liposomes were regarded as a research model of cell membrane, while nowadays they are mainly used as drug carriers to deliver proteins, growth factors and other chemical drugs.

        <p>Tissue engineering, also known as regenerative medicine, aims to develop bioactive implants that can repair or ameliorate the structure and functionality of tissue defects. In tissue engineering, there are three critical elements, cells, scaffolds and bioactive factors [3]. Among them, scaffolds, which can diagnose, repair or improve the functionality in tissue and organ, are regarded as core materials and have attracted a considerable attention in research. Moreover, scaffolds can provide unique features that cannot be achieved by drugs [4], such as (1) provide certain mechanical supporting in defect areas, (2) stimulate cells' differentiation by regulating the Youngs' modulus, and (3) execute, raise or replace some lost functions caused by diseases or impairments. Scaffolds can provide mechanical support and appropriate environment for cell proliferation, and control the flow of blood or other body fluid, which functions as fillers. It is difficult to achieve the repairing goals in serious injuries portion or other clinical requirements when scaffolds are utilized without any drugs or cells.Tissue engineering, also known as regenerative medicine, aims to develop bioactive implants that can repair or ameliorate the structure and functionality of tissue defects.

        <p>Recently, drug-loaded scaffolds were proved to have both therapeutic effects brought by drugs and mechanical support supplied by materials. However, these drug-loaded scaffolds still have some problems, e.g., (1) limited choices at drug types, (2) burst drug release, and (3) difficulty in maintaining certain drug concentration in local areas. Therefore, based on the advantages of liposomes (drug carriers) and the benefits of scaffolds (mechanical supporting), it is reasonable to believe that combining liposomes with scaffolds can help drugs maintain certain concentration in situ for a long period, and the composite systems can provide more functionalities. For example, liposomes-modified scaffolds have more choices at loaded drug types, and in addition, drugs carried in liposomes can provide the composite scaffold capabilities in promoting regeneration in defect areas. Moreover, controlled and responsive drug release in scaffolds can be achieved by using functional liposomes.Recently, drug-loaded scaffolds were proved to have both therapeutic effects brought by drugs and mechanical support supplied by materials.

        <p>Several methods, such as reverse evaporation, pH gradient, ammonium sulfate gradient and repeated freeze thawing, are usually applied in the process of preparing small hydrophilic drugs-loaded liposomes. For example, Takeuchi et al.

Additionally, they observed that boron concentration of the polyborane encapsulated liposomes prepared using the pH gradient achieved 110-150 μg/g of tumor tissue.Several methods, such as reverse evaporation, pH gradient, ammonium sulfate gradient and repeated freeze thawing, are usually applied in the process of preparing small hydrophilic drugs-loaded liposomes.

        <p>Surface modification of the scaffold with polyethylene glycol (PEG), phosphatidylinositol (PI) or ganglioside can bring dense conformational cloud to the liposome systems. This three-dimensional conformation can protect liposomes from opsonin recognition in blood and reduce rapid phagocytosis or uptake in reticuloendothelial system. Therefore, the clearing rate of liposomes can be decreased in vivo and the circulation time in blood can be extended, leading to the prolong drug circulation in blood.

        <p>Currently, scaffolds are widely used for diagnosis, tissue regeneration and function restoration in some organs. Basically, there are mainly three types of scaffolds: metal scaffolds, such as alkali metal scaffolds and some alloy scaffolds; inorganic scaffolds, likes bioactive glass and hydroxyapatite; and organic scaffolds, e.g. polymeric based scaffolds. These scaffolds can supply necessary mechanical support to the local defect area and provide suitable microenvironment for cell proliferation, and these materials can also control the flow of blood and body fluid. However, scaffolds themselves have low therapeutic effect in local area, thus they cannot meet various demands in clinic. Therefore, fabricating drug-loaded scaffolds is necessary for expanding the scaffolds' clinical applications. In this section we introduce different types of scaffolds and the method of drug-loading.Currently, scaffolds are widely used for diagnosis, tissue regeneration and function restoration in some organs.

        <p>As a result, of the excellent mechanical strength, toughness and anti-fatigue performance, metal scaffolds have been widely used in tissue engineering. For example, these metal materials have be used to repair or replace the lesioned or partly worn teeth [32], bones [33], joints or other tissues. These materials can also be regarded as cardiovascular stents [34,35], artificial heart valve [36], etc. Moreover, these metal scaffolds can be produced in different shapes, such as needle, nail, intramedullary needle, crown, triangular nail [37], which is suitable for diverse applications in tissue engineering.As a result, of the excellent mechanical strength, toughness and anti-fatigue performance, metal scaffolds have been widely used in tissue engineering.

For these metal materials, the advantages to apply them in tissue regeneration are the efficiently mechanical strength supported by them, and the stable physicochemical properties.

        <p>Inorganic scaffolds own favorable biocompatibility, mechanical strength and can release some bioactive elements that are necessary in the process of regeneration, thus these scaffolds have been widely investigated. For example, bioactive glass is one type of inorganic scaffold that have been extensively utilized in promoting bone regeneration, because of their excellent biocompatibility, and potential ability in accelerating bone repairing [42], as shown in Figure 1. Hydroxyapatite is one of the most important complements in human bones. The hydroxyapatite based scaffold can not only supply certain mechanical support in the local area, but also constantly release some bioactive elements to the external environment, such as calcium, phosphorus, which are beneficial for tissue repair [43]. Bioinert ceramics like alumina ceramics, glass ceramics, single crystal ceramics, and zirconia ceramics have stable chemical properties [44]. Additionally, these inorganic implants can be further modified by some drugs to make them multifunctional. For example, Yao et al. [45] fabricated dexamethasone-loaded carbon nanotube (CNT), then they combined these nanoparticles with nano-hydroxyapatite/polyamide 66 porous scaffold to promote the differentiation of BMSCs into osteoblast.Inorganic scaffolds own favorable biocompatibility, mechanical strength and can release some bioactive elements that are necessary in the process of regeneration, thus these scaffolds have been widely investigated.

        <p>Most organic scaffolds are polymer scaffolds, according to the sources, these organic scaffolds can be further divided into synthetic polymeric scaffolds, such as polylactic acid (PLA), polycaprolactone (PCL), and poly-L-lactide lactone, and natural polymeric scaffolds, like gelatin, HA, chitosan, and cellulose.Most organic scaffolds are polymer scaffolds, according to the sources, these organic scaffolds can be further divided into synthetic polymeric scaffolds, such as polylactic acid (PLA), polycaprolactone (PCL), and poly-L-lactide lactone, and natural polymeric scaffolds, like gelatin, HA, chitosan, and cellulose.</p>
        <p>Polyglycolic acid (PGA) is a biodegradable, thermoplastic polymer and the simplest linear, aliphatic polyester with a glass transition temperature between 35 and 40 °C. The final degradation products of PGA are carbon dioxide and water, which can be eliminated by body metabolism. Usually, PGA fibers are particularly stiff with high strength and modulus (7 GPa) . This synthetic polymer has been widely used in fabricating internal fixation of fracture, scaffolds for bone regeneration and tendon repair, suture material, etc. Dehnavi et al. [46]prepared a novel conduit based on polymer blend nanocomposites of PGA, collagen, and nanobioglass were prepared by electrospinning technique, which can have potential for nerve regeneration. To treat intervertebral disc degenerative disease, Abbushi et al. [47] filled the defected intervertebral disc area with hybrid scaffold containing PGA and HA. This scaffold was proved can not only supply efficient mechanical strength to the local area, but also to accelerate tissue regeneration.Polyglycolic acid (PGA) is a biodegradable, thermoplastic polymer and the simplest linear, aliphatic polyester with a glass transition temperature between 35 and 40 °C.

        <p>Different from PGA's poor degradability, PLA can be gradually degraded to lactic acid, which will be further adsorbed by the body. Generally, the degradation half-life of PLA is around half to two years. Additionally, due to the low glass transition temperature (around 65 C), PLA is also regarded as a candidate in researching shape memory polymer and 3D-printing technology. Due to these benefits, the applications of PLA in tissue engineering are explored by researchers. For example, Charlesharris et al. [48] investigated the capability of 3D porous scaffolds, containing PLA and calcium phosphate nanoparticles in mediating cell behaviors, during the process of bone regeneration. Chatzikyriakou et al. [49] fabricated composite materials by mixing PLA with β-tricalcium phosphate to promote skull repair. Thakur et al. [50] also dissolved lidocaine and mupirocin in the PLA solution, respectively. Then, they used double nozzle electrospinning technology to construct a complex fiber system, Journal Pre-proof in this system, every single fiber contained these two different drugs, respectively. In the drug release experiments in vitro, because of the different release characteristics between the two drugs, staged drug release was observed in this system. PLA is also easy to be modified with other chemical compounds, which makes it become a novel polymer material for scaffold fabrication. For example, Murakami et al. [51] modified the end of PEG-PLA block compound with aldehyde, using a Schiff base reaction with amino compound to form a hydrogel in 2 seconds, which leads to generate a hydrogel with tissue adhesion ability and provide a novel application strategy for tissue engineering.Different from PGA's poor degradability, PLA can be gradually degraded to lactic acid, which will be further adsorbed by the body. Generally, the degradation half-life of PLA is around half to two years. Additionally, due to the low glass transition temperature (around 65 C), PLA is also regarded as a candidate in researching shape memory polymer and 3D-printing technology. Due to these benefits, the applications of PLA in tissue engineering are explored by researchers. For example, Charlesharris et al.

During the process of jetting, the solvent is evaporated, and the solidified stream is collected to obtain electrospinning fibers [87]. The diameters of electrospinning fibers are usually smaller than the size of cells, and in this case, these fibers can mimic the structure and biological function of natural extracellular matrix [88]. Most of human tissues and organs have similar form and structure of nanofibers, which makes the electrospinning fibers be popular in tissue engineering.As an electrostatic stretching spinning method for polymer, first the polymer solution is incubated under static electricity at thousands or even tens thousands of volts and then under the action of electric field force, these charged droplets are accelerated at the Taylor cone apex of the capillary.

        <p>Firstly, these cells are involved in the process of bone resorption, specifically osteogenic precursor cells are attracted to the site of bone resorption, then proliferation of pre-osteoblasts can be observed under the effect of diverse cytokines. Furthermore, these pre-osteoblasts differentiate to mature osteoblasts that can combine with osteogenic proteins, including type I collagen, osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase, glycoprotein, and growth factors to generate matrix mineralization. Because of the effect of cytokines, some morphological changes happen in osteoblasts, leading to the drop of these cells from the surface of bone, then the circulating osteoclasts can attach through the bone surface, triggering the process of bone resorption. During this process, the osteoblasts surrounding osteoclasts also take part in bone resorption by decomposing the collagen in the bone lacuna. After that, the remained components and generated cytokines can act on osteoclasts to induce the bone generation. Many types of cytokines take part in regulating the process of bone regeneration [118]. In addition, the mechanical properties of the whole system can be influenced by bone defect, because the lack of mechanical supporting and 3D environment would cause the decrease in cell proliferation, attachment and differentiation in the local defect area [119]. Therefore, composite scaffolds, which can release drug in situ for long-term and fill the defect area will provide certain mechanical support for the entire system, have promising prospect in clinical applications.Firstly, these cells are involved in the process of bone resorption, specifically osteogenic precursor cells are attracted to the site of bone resorption, then proliferation of pre-osteoblasts can be observed under the effect of diverse cytokines.

Because of the effect of cytokines, some morphological changes happen in osteoblasts, leading to the drop of these cells from the surface of bone, then the circulating osteoclasts can attach through the bone surface, triggering the process of bone resorption. During this process, the osteoblasts surrounding osteoclasts also take part in bone resorption by decomposing the collagen in the bone lacuna. After that, the remained components and generated cytokines can act on osteoclasts to induce the bone generation. Many types of cytokines take part in regulating the process of bone regeneration [118]. In addition, the mechanical properties of the whole system can be influenced by bone defect, because the lack of mechanical supporting and 3D environment would cause the decrease in cell proliferation, attachment and differentiation in the local defect area [119]. Therefore, composite scaffolds, which can release drug in situ for long-term and fill the defect area will provide certain mechanical support for the entire system, have promising prospect in clinical applications.</p>

        <p>Wound healing is a recovery process after defect or disconnect occurs in skin or other related tissues. This process mainly includes the regeneration of various tissue (including epidermis and dermis), the proliferation of granulation tissue and the formation of scar tissue, where diverse synergy effects can be found in this process [123]. At the same time, angiogenesis, inflammation and anti-infection play important roles in wound healing.Wound healing is a recovery process after defect or disconnect occurs in skin or other related tissues.

Recently, neural stem cells (NSCs) are gradually regarded as cellular sources for spinal cord regeneration, because those cells exhibit potential ability in differentiating into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, and then establishing connection with host cells [128]. However, because of the limits brought by local microenvironment, most of these neural stem cells tend to differentiate into astrocytes or oligodendrocytes instead of neurons. Therefore, it is meaningful to induce these neural stem cells to differentiate into neurons for spinal cord regeneration.Permanent functional defect will be caused by spinal cord injury, including neuronal and axonal damage; moreover, the regeneration ability of spinal cord is limited, therefore it is still a big challenge to treat spinal cord injury in clinic [127].

Moreover, it can also provide sufficiently mechanical support to the defect area and suitable microenvironment for the cells' adhesion and proliferation. During the process of tissue regeneration, regulating cytokines and promoting differentiation of cells play important roles. Thus, to broaden the application of composite scaffolds in tissue regeneration, some modification could be processed in lecithin, which is the major composition for liposomes.

However, liposomes still face some challenges, for example, the liposomes have some troubles in transporting and store drugs. Moreover, it is difficult for liposomes to maintain certain drug concentrations in the local area for long periods of time. Therefore, to make liposomes more suitable for the clinical applications, these disadvantages should be solved without compromising their advantage properties.Liposomes are nanocarriers that can maintain drugs in the lipid bilayer and inner core.
