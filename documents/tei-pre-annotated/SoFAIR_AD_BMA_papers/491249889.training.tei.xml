        <p>A growing commitment from companies to implement circular economy (CE) strategies demands the development of guidelines for consistent related external communication. The fields of non-financial reporting and sustainability are well established with numerous available international reporting frameworks and approaches; however, there is still an absence of standardised reporting principles and procedures for publishing progress on circularity. In this context, this article aims to explore how companies could include CE within their corporate sustainability reports, through an academic literature review and content analysis of existent reporting approaches. Results showed a clear disconnection between CE and sustainability reporting literature. Overall, only a few of the revised reporting approaches explicitly mention CE, and the guidance given to companies is very general, inconsistent and places the responsibility of selecting performance assessment approaches on the companies. The analysis contributes to identifying opportunities for transparent external communication of CE issues, as well as exploring the challenges and limitations.A growing commitment from companies to implement circular economy (CE) strategies demands the development of guidelines for consistent related external communication.

CE has also become influential across business circles, where work done by organisations, such as the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF), promote CE as an 'economic model which seeks to ultimately decouple global economic development from finite resource consumption', often illustrated with the butterfly diagram distinguishing between technical and biological cycles (EMF, 2015b, p. 2).waste' (EC, 2015, p. 2).

        <p>Despite the increasing promotion of CE from international institutions and private organisations, academic research has identified potential sustainability trade-offs and rebound effects from implementing CE principles (Geissdoerfer et al., 2017;Korhonen et al., 2018). This 'rebound effect' can be defined as the reduction in expected benefits from new and more efficient technologies because of changes in consumer behaviour or the need for producers to maintain production of new products (Berkhout et al., 2000). This kind of effect could also be connected with 'greenwashing': the corporate practice of claiming or exaggerating sustainability with the purpose of hiding a questionable environmental or socio-economic performance (Braga Junior et al., 2019). In order to monitor and prevent rebound effects from the implementation of CE strategies and subsequent greenwashing, it is imperative for companies to be transparent regarding the assessment and reporting of progress on circularity. This could be achieved through the use of quantitative metrics as well as qualitative evaluation approaches. When using these options, organisations can consider the impacts of their CE practices towards their organisational sustainability goals. Transparency to demonstrate how internal changes (e.g., CE implementation) are actually impacting a company's sustainability performance are often formally communicated through 'corporate sustainability reporting' (EC, 2021;Lock &amp; Seele, 2016). Higgins and Coffey (2016) stated that sustainability reporting can contribute to a company establishing their own conceptualisation of sustainability, as well as their strategic integration of sustainability principles. To facilitate the reporting writing process, reporting frameworks and approaches were constructed to ensure comparable, measured and reliable disclosures from companies across sectors (Thomson, 2015).Despite the increasing promotion of CE from international institutions and private organisations, academic research has identified potential sustainability trade-offs and rebound effects from implementing CE principles (Geissdoerfer et al., 2017;Korhonen et al., 2018).

        <p>Significant drivers of sustainability reporting are, not only the typical non-financial stakeholders' demands (e.g., from consumers, local communities and non-governmental organisations [NGOs]), but also those from the investment communities (e.g., shareholders and banks) who are increasingly asking for transparency of business practices (Ditlev-Simonsen &amp; Midttun, 2010). Thus, the quantity and quality of information disclosed in sustainability reports can be used by stakeholders to measure an organisation's legitimacy (Kuo et al., 2012). But with a growing landscape of competing reporting options available to companies, which are intended to reduce bias in self-assessment, the decision of which one to implement is not so straightforward, as highlighted by Thijssens et al. (2016). Furthermore, the capacity of reporting approaches to improve the quality and transparency of nonfinancial disclosures and in turn the sustainability performance of a company, remains heavily debated (Cortesi &amp; Vena, 2019;de Villiers &amp; Sharma, 2020;Flower, 2015;Melloni et al., 2017;Thomson, 2015).Significant drivers of sustainability reporting are, not only the typical non-financial stakeholders' demands (e.g., from consumers, local communities and non-governmental organisations [NGOs]), but also those from the investment communities (e.g., shareholders and banks) who are increasingly asking for transparency of business practices (Ditlev-Simonsen &amp; Midttun, 2010).

        <p>To shed light on this issue, a review of corporate sustainability reporting approaches and how they are integrating CE aspects is presented. Therefore, the main research aim is to explore how existent sustainability reporting approaches and literature guide companies to include CE issues. This guidance will be explored in terms of both the structure and content of the reporting approaches and will be extracted from academic literature, reporting approaches and related documents. To achieve these aims, the remainder of this article is structured as follows. The next section provides a theoretical overview of the key concepts informing this research. In the third section, the methods utilised in this article are described. Following this, the academic articles are reviewed and the list of reporting approaches available to companies is selected and analysed using the coding framework. Finally, the article discusses critical reflections on the findings and concludes with suggestions for future research.To shed light on this issue, a review of corporate sustainability reporting approaches and how they are integrating CE aspects is presented.

        <p>The practice of sustainability reporting has evolved from the corporate social responsibility (CSR) movement. In the 1970s, the first collection of organisations publishing information regarding their environmental and social aspects was seen in both the United States and Western Europe (Junior et al., 2014;Kolk &amp; Pinkse, 2010). This practice gained serious prominence during the late 1990s and early 2000s partly due to the publication of the triple bottom line (TBL) concept (Elkington, 1997). The TBL model, popularised as 'people, planet, profit' (PPP) is an accounting framework responding to the Brundtland definition of SD in 1987 (World Commission on Environment andDevelopment, 1987). Research from Davis-Walling and Batterman (1997) and Kolk (1999) contributed to the foundations of practices for evaluating the quality of sustainability reports. The evolution of sustainability reporting has been comprehensively summarised in numerous articles, such as Deegan and Blomquist (2006), Buhr (2007), Gray andMilne (2008), Owen andO'Dwyer (2009), Dumay et al. (2016) and Rupley et al. (2017).The practice of sustainability reporting has evolved from the corporate social responsibility (CSR) movement.

        <p>Sustainability reports should consist of objective information allowing stakeholders to make reliable evaluations of the organisation's non-financial performance, including (but not limited to) social and environmental aspects (Gray, 2006). By disclosing targets, benchmarks and commitments within a sustainability report, a company may help investors and other stakeholders to put its performance in context (EC, 2017). Reporting on sustainability performance could potentially provide numerous benefits for a company including: increased credibility, reduced legal risks, improved supplier relationships, increased access to capital and increased ethical behaviour along the supply chain (Paun, 2018). Regarding a company's individual approach to sustainability, sustainability reports are said to be their most direct expression (Comas Martí &amp; Seifert, 2013). A corporate sustainability report can also be known as several other titles such as: Sustainability Report, CSR Report, Integrated Report, Environment, Social &amp; Governance (ESG) Disclosure or Environmental Report. Some researchers argue however, that no organisation producing sustainability reports can give equal billing to each of the components of the TBL (Gray et al., 2014) and that the expression 'sustainability reporting' is moving further away from the form of sustainability put forward with the Brundtland definition (Hahn &amp; Kühnen, 2013). However, due to the recent publication of the draft proposal from the EC, 'Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive' (EC, 2021), which proposes the terminology shift from 'non-financial report' (as defined in the European Non-Financial Reporting Directive in 2014-see text below) to 'sustainability report', in this article, the term 'sustainability reporting' will be used. Here, this term refers to the voluntary or mandatory reporting activities of a company publishing a report composed of either exclusively or partially non-financial information, irrespective of the reports title or the reporting approach employed (EC, 2014). Sustainability reports themselves are merely a product of sustainability accounting and strategic management processes, which includes: strategic goal development (Gagné, 2018), resource allocation (Bower, 1971(Bower, , 2017)), implementation and management of change (Hussey, 1998) and assessment, monitoring and communication (Gamerschlag et al., 2011;Lozano &amp; Huisingh, 2011). Research within corporate sustainability has demonstrated that in order to cope with emerging sustainability challenges, organisations require a specific set of capabilities to go beyond mere regulatory compliance (Teece et al., 1997;Wu et al., 2013). Furthermore, several studies have examined how accounting processes (and by extension reporting processes) influence both the development and management of a company's corporate strategy (Baumgartner &amp; Rauter, 2017;Skaerbaek &amp; Tryggestad, 2010). Therefore, sustainability reporting can be utilised as a main driver facilitating change towards corporate sustainability within a company (Adams &amp; McNicholas, 2007;Lozano et al., 2016). Authors such as Vermeulen and Witjes (2016) stress that corporate sustainability is not only about sustainability issues (e.g., PPP) but must incorporate a time dimension: both taking a long-term perspective enabling radical transformative changes and a short-term perspective, starting with activities which can be implemented tomorrow. Burritt and Schaltegger (2010) suggest that sustainability reports are tools that help managers make sustainability decisions. Through a review of literature, these authors offer two managerial perspectives: (i) the 'inside-out', meaning reports are developed by the company and their business strategy or (ii) the 'outside-in', where reporting is driven by external communication requests made by stakeholders (Burritt &amp; Schaltegger, 2010;Domingues et al., 2017). Lozano et al. (2016) investigated these two perspectives in practice and concluded through a survey of 91 reporting companies, that sustainability reporting processes were mainly driven from internal motivations and their impact had facilitated changes for sustainability. Despite these examples of the potential benefits of sustainability reporting to a company's strategic management, it should also be noted that some authors claim companies are more likely taking an 'outside-in' perspective, simply 'free-riding' on the backs of leading reporting companies whilst continuing in their pursuit of profit and growth (R. Gray &amp; Milne, 2002).Sustainability reports should consist of objective information allowing stakeholders to make reliable evaluations of the organisation's non-financial performance, including (but not limited to) social and environmental aspects (Gray, 2006).

        <p>Boiral and Heras-Saizarbitoria (2019) discuss that, despite advancements with social accounting practices, there has not been a direct increase in the quality of sustainability reports being published. Hopwood et al. (2005) voiced that companies are reporting more often on aims and intentions rather than on actual actions and performance. Even in 1998, researchers determined that managers often disclose information in a narrative format because such disclosures can be customised to manage public impressions (Neu et al., 1998). This is not unlike the process of 'decoupling', as labelled by Meyer and Rowan (1977), which concerns a company's symbolic adoption of new structures or sustainability words whilst still operating with the same traditional policies and activities, resulting in a ritualistic compliance. As previously mentioned, to decrease these shortcomings, reporting frameworks, initiatives and approaches (henceforth reporting approaches) have been developed which assist organisations to report comparable, consistent and trusted non-financial information required by national and/or international guidelines (EC, 2017). Reporting approaches can be issued and published by different types of institutions, including the following: governments, financial market regulators, stock exchanges, industry bodies, investors, standard setters, consultancies, NGOs and intergovernmental organisations (Van der Lugt et al., 2020). In addition, informal reporting approaches have also been proposed by academics as the result of a growing body of CSR research (e.g., Sureeyatanapas et al., 2015;Yongvanich &amp; Guthrie, 2006). Companies may use multiple reporting approaches to publish a report; however, this still results in a lack of comparability between data within sustainability reports (Eccles &amp; Saltzman, 2011). Generally, the discussion within academic literature focuses on the most commonly used horizontal reporting framework: 'GRI Standards' and increasingly, the 'International Integrated Reporting Framework' (Hahn &amp; Kühnen, 2013;Perši c et al., 2017). Which reporting approach a company selects is important; indeed, as Adams (2017) determined, the specific content related to value creation and sustainability issues can have a significant impact on the mindset of organisational leaders. The growth of reporting approaches available to companies within the last decade has resulted in a diverse landscape of reporting approaches all competing for dominance (Siew, 2015).Boiral and Heras-Saizarbitoria (2019) discuss that, despite advancements with social accounting practices, there has not been a direct increase in the quality of sustainability reports being published.

        <p>It is becoming increasingly obligatory for companies to formally report non-financial information. For example, the European Union (EU) regulatory Non-Financial Reporting Directive 2014/95/EU (EC, 2014) impacts all sustainability reports published from 2018 by large public-interest companies. Following this, the EC published Guidelines on Non-Financial Reporting (methodology for reporting nonfinancial information) (2017/C 215/01) which acts as non-binding guidelines to assist companies in disclosing information in accordance with the directive (EC, 2017). Although a European level policy, the guidelines are based on information compiled from academic literature and various national and international reporting approaches. Furthermore, the guidelines state that while its aim is to address companies which are required to produce a mandatory non-financial disclosure, they also represent best practice for companies who wish to voluntarily produce a report (EC, 2017). There are relatively few studies focussing on the process of developing corporate sustainability reports, primarily as most companies are utilising the report formats and procedures formally prescribed in reporting approaches (Roca &amp; Searcy, 2012). Generally, a company's corporate sustainability report will include text describing their: (i) sustainability vision and objectives (e.g., Adams, 2017;Gray, 2006); (ii) company policies, management systems and stakeholder relations (e.g., Daub, 2007;Lozano, 2020); and (iii) the company's performance in the context of sustainability, inclusive of relevant key performance indicators (KPIs) (e.g., GRI, 2016;Roca &amp; Searcy, 2012). Building on this, the guidelines formulated eight key content elements (e.g., business model and KPIs) which must be addressed within a corporate sustainability report (European Commission, 2017) (see Appendix A, Table A1). As a result, these content elements are often utilised in academic studies as a basis to analyse the quality, format and style of sustainability disclosures (e.g., Manes-Rossi et al., 2018;S ¸tef anescu et al., 2021).It is becoming increasingly obligatory for companies to formally report non-financial information.

        <p>In recent years, the United Nations' (UN's) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have become a globally recognised framework for society to progress towards SD (UN, 2015). Because of this, companies are aligning their sustainability initiatives and targets with the SDG agenda (Rosati &amp; Faria, 2019). In response, numerous reporting initiatives including the 'GRI Standards' and the 'Integrated Reporting Framework' have published supplementary material which support companies to integrate the SDGs within an organisation's internal goal setting process. The analysis of sustainability reports to evaluate a company's commitment and operationalisation of the SDGs has become a rapidly growing area of research and highlights the potential of reporting initiatives to influence the development of a company's response to emerging sustainability challenges (e.g., Biermann et al., 2017;Izzo et al., 2020;Tsalis et al., 2020).In recent years, the United Nations' (UN's) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have become a globally recognised framework for society to progress towards SD (UN, 2015).

The analysis of sustainability reports to evaluate a company's commitment and operationalisation of the SDGs has become a rapidly growing area of research and highlights the potential of reporting initiatives to influence the development of a company's response to emerging sustainability challenges (e.g., Biermann et al., 2017;Izzo et al., 2020;Tsalis et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>CE is not a novel concept, and authors have discussed its origins and pre-cursors (see Calisto Friant et al., 2020). CE is most often presented as activities related to waste and resource management, aiming to establish a decoupling of economic development from finite resource consumption through introducing closed resource loops (Ghisellini et al., 2016;Kirchherr et al., 2017). Several authors argue that these narrow conceptions of CE focussed on resource efficiency do not support a system thinking approach, which help companies consider the impacts of CE strategies from a broader sustainability perspective (Webster, 2013). For example, research from Schroeder et al. (2019) suggest that CE can be a tool having positive contributions on numerous SDGs, beyond only those linked with the environmental dimension. This notion is echoed by other authors who have discussed CE as one of many sustainability narratives positioned as having the potential to lead society towards positive transformative change (D'Amato, 2021;Opferkuch, Raggi, et al., 2021;Roos Lindgreen, Walker). These studies highlight the conceptual diversity of CE which is not only being discussed within academic literature but is also evident within international CE policies. Through an analysis of EU CE policies, Calisto Friant et al. (2020) described the primary discourse of CE being promoted as both holistic and optimist. However, the targets and measures included within the EU policies reviewed are labelled as segmented and focus only on 'end of pipe' solutions (Calisto Friant et al., 2020). The ability of CE to address the underlying causes of sustainability challenges is dependent on how the narrative of CE is understood and subsequently implemented (D'Amato, 2021).CE is not a novel concept, and authors have discussed its origins and pre-cursors (see Calisto Friant et al., 2020).

        <p>The transition towards a CE presents a new business paradigm, one associated with critical challenges in terms of resource management, stakeholder management, financial and regulatory aspects, organisational barriers and consumer acceptance (Ritzén &amp; Sandström, 2017;Stewart &amp; Niero, 2018). This paradigm requires companies to rethink the way they create and deliver value, ensuring that CE promotes organisational sustainability (Lozano, 2020). Companies implementing closed loop systems are compelled to work with an ecosystem of actors, requiring a shift from firm-centric to networkcentric operational logic and sustainability assessments (Blomsma et al., 2019;Walker et al., 2020). For these reasons, the research field concerning quantitative and qualitative approaches for CE assessment at both the company and product level is growing rapidly (Corona et al., 2019;Kristensen &amp; Mosgaard, 2020). To date, there is no uniform approach to the assessment of CE practices, with proposed approaches ranging across scales such as (i) single indicators, for example, the circularity degree from Haas et al. (2015), (ii) circularity indices, for example, Material Circularity Indicator (MCI) from EMF (2015a) and (iii) company-level assessment frameworks, for example, Circularity Measurement Toolkit from Garza-Reyes et al. (2018). To contrast, some studies suggest that the evolution of assessment approaches for CE are losing sight of sustainability indicators (Kravchenko et al., 2020) or are rarely based on scientific evidence and risk driving 'circularity for circularity's sake' (Harris et al., 2021).The transition towards a CE presents a new business paradigm, one associated with critical challenges in terms of resource management, stakeholder management, financial and regulatory aspects, organisational barriers and consumer acceptance (Ritzén &amp; Sandström, 2017;Stewart &amp; Niero, 2018).

        <p>The conceptual limitations of CE and its assessment identified in literature could translate into practical limitations for companies adopting CE strategies (Calisto Friant et al., 2020). Without strong theoretical foundations of the CE concept, a company claiming improvements in their sustainability performance due to the implementation of CE strategies could easily be accused of greenwashing, similar to discussions involving the 'green growth' discourse (Gregson et al., 2015). Thus, companies' commitments towards CE may largely remain aspirational without formal guidance provided in reporting approaches (Jones &amp; Comfort, 2017).The conceptual limitations of CE and its assessment identified in literature could translate into practical limitations for companies adopting CE strategies (Calisto Friant et al., 2020).

        <p>Directive is being reviewed, with the aim of increasing disclosure on climate and environmental data as well as ensuring sustainable investments (EC, 2019). A first draft of this revision suggests that indeed, the requirements for reporting a company's sustainability performance will involve more detail, also mentioning CE in relation with resource use as a potential material issue companies will have to report on (EC, 2021). With these policy developments, not only will the amount and quality of data required to be reported by companies in the near future increase but also the number of companies required to publish sustainability data. This increasing public pressure emphasises the need for guiding principles to be included within reporting approaches, ensuring that quality and comparable CE-related information will be disclosed by companies moving forward. However, before these guiding principles and procedures can be proposed, research is needed to clarify the current challenges regarding reporting CE issues in accordance with the guidance of reporting approaches.Directive is being reviewed, with the aim of increasing disclosure on climate and environmental data as well as ensuring sustainable investments (EC, 2019).

        <p>This section describes the literature review approach applied in this research. This approach is adapted and applied on two bodies of literature: academic and reporting approaches, namely, reporting frameworks, standards, guidelines and policy documents. It utilises qualitative content analysis methods with the purpose of not only identifying key words within the text but also understanding and interpreting the contextual use of these key words (Hsieh &amp; Shannon, 2005). The overall research approach is graphically presented in Figure 1.This section describes the literature review approach applied in this research.

        <p>First, a systematic review was carried out to collect a sample of academic articles, and then a qualitative content analysis was performed to assess them (Grant &amp; Booth, 2009). The aim of the systematic review was to find and discuss themes across multiple studies. The final outcome presents a broad understanding of the connection between CE and sustainability reporting (Butler et al., 2016). A review protocol has been developed in line with the qualitative systematic review method to reduce bias and locate relevant sources.First, a systematic review was carried out to collect a sample of academic articles, and then a qualitative content analysis was performed to assess them (Grant &amp; Booth, 2009).

        <p>The database search was conducted for scientific articles written in English and peer-reviewed found in the Scopus and 
            <rs type="software">Google Scholar</rs> databases. Articles were included if they were published between 2012 and July 2020. This timeframe ensured that the literature being reviewed was published just prior to the noted increase in CE-related literature in 2013-2014(as identified in Geissdoerfer et al., 2017) ) and since the first report published by the EMF in 2012, and the consequent increase in public promotion of the CE concept (EMF, 2012). A search query was devised to search for the selected terms in the title, abstract and keywords of publications. Eight search strings were selected in combination with the term 'circular*'-the asterisk is a truncation symbol to allow different endings of the search term (e.g., circularity) to be included in the results. According to the report Reporting Matters (WBCSD, 2019), for the year 2018 corporate reports were most commonly referred to as sustainability report (42%), annual report (16%), integrated report (14%) or CSR report (4%) in declining order. By knowing this, each of these four report titles were included as separate search strings. Additionally, less frequently used terms related to reporting were added: 'disclosure', 'communication', 'performance evaluation' and 'environment, social &amp; governance' (ESG). By including all of these eight search terms with the operator 'or' and the term 'circular*', the possibility of excluding relevant literature due to incorrect terminology is reduced.

        <p>As the research developed, it became clear that a cohesive and commonly used list of reporting approaches available to companies to guide sustainability disclosures was not available. Thus, to identify relevant documents, firstly the Guidelines on Non-Financial Reporting (methodology for reporting non-financial information) (2017/C 215/01) was analysed (EC, 2017). This revealed two lists of widely accepted reporting approaches mentioned within the document, which were F I G U R E 1 Summary of research steps then combined to create the initial sample (n = 23) (as seen in Table A2).As the research developed, it became clear that a cohesive and commonly used list of reporting approaches available to companies to guide sustainability disclosures was not available.

        <p>To ensure this list was still valid in the current reporting landscape, an additional cross-referencing step using a Google search was made. This step aimed to identify any other documents which are not exclusively intended as a reporting framework but include content relevant to reporting of CE issues. Similar to the methodology used for academic literature, a search query was developed to combine three search strings with the term 'circular economy'. The search strings include 'reporting framework', 'reporting guidelines' and 'organisational framework'. Four additional documents were identified: two which act as reporting frameworks and two which focus on the organisational implementation of CE. These additional documents were then added to the sample (n = 27).To ensure this list was still valid in the current reporting landscape, an additional cross-referencing step using a Google search was made.

        <p>With this sample of documents, a criterion sampling technique was employed to ensure the final sample of reporting approaches are relevant to the research aims (Palinkas et al., 2015). Four selection criteria labelled SC1 to SC4 (as seen in Table 1) were designed to ensure that the final sample of reporting approaches was the most relevant for companies engaged with CE and wanting to produce a sustainability report across sectors and regions. The sample of 27 reporting approaches was then reviewed and the ones which did not satisfy all four selection criteria were excluded (the remaining approaches and reasons for exclusion are presented in Table A3). The final sample contained 15 documents relevant for organisational CE reporting (n = 15).With this sample of documents, a criterion sampling technique was employed to ensure the final sample of reporting approaches are relevant to the research aims (Palinkas et al., 2015).

        <p>Using the sample list, each reporting approach was analysed for CE on two dimensions: (i) structure of the reporting approaches and (ii) the content of the guidance on CE issues. To do this, a content analysis approach, consisting of the collection and coding of 'meaning units', was developed to facilitate a transparent and consistent analysis of the qualitative documentation (Bryman, 2012). 'Meaning units' are defined as 'the constellation of sentences or paragraphs containing aspects related to each other, answering the question set out in the aim' (Bengtsson, 2016;Catanzaro, 1988). All 15 reporting approaches were read, and any explicit text mentioning 'circular economy', or also more broadly other terminologies including 'circular*', were collected and recorded as meaning units. The extracted text will provide evidence of how companies producing a sustainability report are being advised by reporting approaches to integrate CE within their corporate sustainability strategy and ultimately be included in their sustainability reports.Using the sample list, each reporting approach was analysed for CE on two dimensions: (i) structure of the reporting approaches and (ii) the content of the guidance on CE issues.

        <p>For the dimension of structure, (if and) where the reporting approach mentions CE was noted in order to obtain insights into which key content elements of a report companies are being suggested to include CE within their reports. The coding framework was developed by examining each reporting approach and noting the (i) format, that is, whether CE is included as a central topic within principle documents or within supplementary material and (ii) content elements, that is, where CE was mentioned across the three key content elements required for sustainability reports: (i) sustainability vision and objectives, (ii) company policies, management systems and stakeholder relations, and (iii) the company's performance in the context of sustainability. Using an inductive approach, the data gathered allowed classifying approaches into three main categories (and two sub-categories) as described in Table 2. The location of each 'meaning unit' within the reporting approaches allowed each reporting approach to be categorised as one of the three. As little is known about how CE could be incorporated into reporting, a document categorised as Fully integrated does not necessarily mean it will produce a better sustainability report discussing CE issues than a framework which is classified as Partially integrated. Instead, the aim is to observe where the authors of reporting approaches have chosen to include CE (or could choose in the future) and how frequent these categories are being applied in current reporting approaches.

However, the following section will describe the common themes extracted from the academic articles reviewed et al. (2018) suggest that, to increase synergies between the fields of both CSR and CE, intra-corporate exchange of best practices is critical. In order to transition towards a CE, no single entity can do this alone and their commitment must be expressed both internally and externally. This collaborative process could be accelerated through comparable sustainability reporting, to identify collaboration opportunities between organisations along the supply chain. (Gusmerotti et al., 2019, pp. 324). Companies which limit their focus to internal operations will reduce the potential economic and market opportunities related to CE. On the other hand, companies who focus too much on marketing actions and communication could be interpreted as greenwashing and hinder their success in the market (Gusmerotti et al., 2019). Laurenti et al. (2018) add suggestions for corporate communication through their study on waste impacts for circular products. Through stakeholder consultation with life cycle assessment (LCA) practitioners and consumers, the researchers identified the paradox of suggesting metrics which are simple enough for consumers to understand but complex enough so they can still convey the significance of different environmental impacts (Laurenti et al., 2018).

        <p>Among the conclusions, the researchers emphasize that within the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector, the integration of CE in sustainability reports has started and is mostly often associated with recycling and reusing (Stewart &amp; Niero, 2018). The results also showed that sustainability reports which had more elaboration on CE were lacking references to sustainability performance indicators or assessment methodologies (Stewart &amp; Niero, 2018). This could indicate that companies are unsure of how to comprehensively communicate the integration of the assessment of CE practices within sustainability reports. Fortunati et al. (2020) analysed the integration of CSR and CE within multi-national companies in the cosmetics industry. The authors observed that in numerous cases, the circular approach was not clearly described or supported by quantified actions and objections (Fortunati et al., 2020). Similarly, Dagiliene et al. (2020) determined, through content analysis of sustainability reports within the manufacturing sector, that companies are still not reporting much information about CE. Findings suggested that sustainability reports which do describe reuse, recycle and recover practices still do not contain sufficient data from the holistic perspective of CE. The authors also acknowledge the potential for reporting approaches and assurance standards to positively guide the development of the reporting of CE strategies; however, more work needs to be done to integrate CE within existing environmental management accounting tools (Dagiliene et al., 2020).Among the conclusions, the researchers emphasize that within the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector, the integration of CE in sustainability reports has started and is mostly often associated with recycling and reusing (Stewart &amp; Niero, 2018).

        <p>Through the use of the category definition, none of the five reporting approaches listed in Table 5 propose their own original definition for CE.

The connection between CE and sustainability remains implicit; however, the benefits of CE implementation on all three dimensions of sustainability are discussed. Acknowledging structural differences of the reporting approaches, GRI clearly describes at the beginning of the 'GRI 306: Waste 2020' how this document is one part of the broader environmental series of standards which are accompanied by economic and social standards, completing the sustainability standards from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI, 2020). From the perspective of a company adhering to the GRI framework, CE may only be mentioned within a sustainability report in relation to the environmental dimension of sustainability and more specifically, only through the perspective of waste. This is also the case within EMAS where the entire reporting approach relates solely to environmental management systems within organisations.Analysis and classification of content for reporting approaches which mention CE according to the four categories defined in Development, 1987).

        <p>As noted in previous research and seen in Figure 2, CE is most commonly presented in sustainability reports: (i) using the definition from EMF; (ii) highlighting the connection with only the environmental dimension of sustainability; and (iii) generally, without using consistent data selection or narratives (Dagiliene et al., 2020;Stewart &amp; Niero, 2018). These three CE reporting trends were also identified in the findings from the review of reporting approaches, as seen in Figure 2, which encompasses the most common advice provided within reporting approaches for how companies should report CE. Although the study from Stewart and Niero (2018) focuses on one sector, it is an example of the level of influence reporting approaches can have on the perceptions of CE embraced by companies. As mentioned earlier, CE is frequently being explored and promoted as a tool to achieve the SDGs (Schroeder et al., 2019), which is a framework consisting of not only environmental, but social and economic societal goals. Particularly, more recent research is investigating the relevance of the social dimension of sustainability to CE practices (Kühnen &amp; Hahn, 2017;Walker, Opferkuch, Roos Lindgree, Simboli, et al., 2021). The present study showed that the most frequent discourse adopted by the reviewed reporting approaches is that CE is only considered with the environmental dimension of CE, more specifically only with waste management operations or resource management at a practical level. This perception implies CE strategies will amount to 'incremental rather than radical transformations, a "weak" rather than a "strong" form of sustainability' (Hobson &amp; Lynch, 2016, p. 18). 'Hesitant company culture' has been identified as a pressing barrier for CE implementation, where CE-related discussions exist as a niche topic within the sustainability department and ignored in the more influential financial departments of companies (Kirchherr et al., 2018). Results from this study suggest that reporting approaches in fact reinforce this barrier, with none of them yet positioning CE as a central topic within an organisation or presenting consistent guidance on CE-related content. It is not likely that application of the reporting approaches reviewed in this study will facilitate CE-related conversations outside of a company's sustainability department nor for CE to be encompassed in all business functions, as suggested by authors such as Gusmerotti et al. (2019). Additionally, as determined, the contents of reporting frameworks can influence both the mindset of company leaders (Adams, 2017) as well as encourage long-term thinking (Vermeulen &amp; Witjes, 2016). Therefore, the findings of the current research suggest that the lack of CE within the existent reporting approaches will not likely result in CE being further integrated in management level sustainability decisions, as Burritt and Schaltegger (2010) suggest sustainability reports can do.As noted in previous research and seen in Figure 2, CE is most commonly presented in sustainability reports: (i) using the definition from EMF; (ii) highlighting the connection with only the environmental dimension of sustainability; and (iii) generally, without using consistent data selection or narratives (Dagiliene et al., 2020;Stewart &amp; Niero, 2018).

        <p>This reflects the ongoing debate and uncertainty within literature about how best to define and measure the impact of CE strategies due to the absence of any benchmark or standard relating to CE implementation. Further to this, across the reviewed reporting approaches, different CE assessment approaches are suggested for companies to utilise and then include the results of this assessment within their sustainability report. This lack of consistency between reporting approaches with regards to the assessment of CE indicates that not only are there inconsistencies between the advice of different reporting approaches, but also within the approaches, as companies utilising the same reporting approach will apply different assessment approaches and report different CE data. This implies that for the case of CE issues, the use of sustainability reporting approaches will not likely support consistent data selection, increase organisational transparency or produce comparable sustainability reports, as reporting approaches are intended to do (Lozano &amp; Huisingh, 2011;Thomson, 2015a). This challenge of inconsistent CE data collection may also inhibit increased supply chain collaborations, a characteristic imperative to the advancement of CE (Howard et al., 2019).This reflects the ongoing debate and uncertainty within literature about how best to define and measure the impact of CE strategies due to the absence of any benchmark or standard relating to CE implementation.

        <p>Within both the BSI and WEF frameworks, it is acknowledged that there is currently no universally accepted or standardised approach to measuring organisational circularity (BSI, 2017;World Economic Forum, 2020). Results from this study show that the landscape of reporting approaches is also void of any universally accepted approach to disclosing CE issues (listed in Figure 2). (e.g., Geissdoerfer et al., 2017;Ghisellini et al., 2016;Prieto-Sandoval et al., 2018). Findings within this study suggest that despite this multitude of definitions, companies utilising reporting approaches will most likely be provided with the definition of CE from EMF as their main reference, as efforts from EMF continue to successfully drive the CE transition within the private sector. As stated earlier, the assessment and monitoring of strategies are an integral basis for the development of corporate communication strategies (Gamerschlag et al., 2011); therefore, as cohesion within CE assessment approaches advances, it is likely that reporting approaches will be revised. In fact, the ISO have created a technical committee for CE, ISO/TC 323, which will work to standardise the implementation of CE, with the context of SD (ISO, 2018). However, until these standards are published, it seems that the number of CE definitions and assessment approaches proposed within literature will continue to multiply and diverge, causing acceptance of CE definitions and robust assessment approaches for varying contexts to be more difficult.Within both the BSI and WEF frameworks, it is acknowledged that there is currently no universally accepted or standardised approach to measuring organisational circularity (BSI, 2017;World Economic Forum, 2020).

        <p>Reporting approaches are constantly competing for dominance as the authority for sustainability reporting (Siew, 2015). The development of uniform approaches to reporting of CE issues will assist in improving the legitimacy of CE and circular products much needed within society (Bovea et al., 2018;Muranko et al., 2019;Peschel &amp; Aschemann-Witzel, 2020). The most effective structure and content of these uniform approaches, whether through the development of comprehensive supplementary material specific for CE or through integrating CE issues within principle reporting documents remains unclear. This article determined that CE issues were primarily a voluntary issue to report, however, companies possessing an 'inside-out' managerial perspective (Burritt &amp; Schaltegger, 2010) or an 'ecologically-and eco-justice-informed approach' to reporting (Gray, 2006) can be more proactive and formulate a comprehensive strategy to reporting CE issues. If companies have an 'outside-in' managerial approach and acknowledging that literature suggests the most commonly applied reporting instruments are GRI and the IIRC, then the results here show it is most likely companies engaged with CE will either: exclude any mention of CE within their report or they will qualitatively describe their circularity measures implemented with relation only to the environmental dimension of sustainability, more specifically regarding the prevention of waste generation.Reporting approaches are constantly competing for dominance as the authority for sustainability reporting (Siew, 2015).

        <p>So, as illustrated in Figure 2 The research methods chosen for this study have limitations which must be recognised. Firstly, as with any academic literature review, the selection of databases, timeframe and keywords may have excluded relevant articles from being included for review. In particular with CE-related literature, where a significant increase in the number of articles published in the last 5 years has resulted in a fast-changing landscape of CE research. In addition, only horizontal frameworks were included for review, meaning there may be some sector or product level reporting guidelines or indices available that advise on CE; however, this was not within the scope of this study.So, as illustrated in Figure 2 The research methods chosen for this study have limitations which must be recognised.
