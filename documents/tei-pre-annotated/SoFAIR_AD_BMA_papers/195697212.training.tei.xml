        <p>Knowledge integration (KI) is a source of sustained competitive advantage for firms. This paper draws upon the knowledge-based view of the firm and ability-motivation-opportunity framework to develop a theoretical and empirical model showing the role of human resource management (HRM) practices in achieving KI. Findings suggest three ability-enhancing practices (training and development, focused hiring, and knowledge questioning values), four motivation-enhancing practices (project-specific performance, competency-based performance management, project-based information dissemination, and information and knowledge sharing forums) and five opportunity-enhancing practices (team working, information and knowledge sharing, verticalisation of business, geographical information and knowledge sharing, and structural change) that facilitate KI. The paper concludes with managerial implications, directions for future research and the study's limitations.</p>
        <p>Knowledge management and integration for competitive advantage has gained prominence in the last two decades (Connell &amp; Voola, 2013;Grandori &amp; Kogut, 2002). Grant's (1996) knowledge-based view of the firm focuses on a firm's ability to apply specialist knowledge for sustained firm performance, wherein knowledge integration (KI) has been noted as a key organisational capability for applying specialist knowledge to an organisation's production function (Henderson &amp; Clark, 1990;Grant, 1996a, b;Grandori, 2001;Okhuysen &amp; Eisenhardt, 2002) and achieving innovation outcomes in high-technology firms (Berggren et al, 2013;Johansson, Axelson, Enberg &amp; Tell, 2013).</p>
        <p>Prior research found that human resource management (HRM) practices can facilitate knowledge management processes, such as, knowledge sharing, knowledge acquisition, knowledge transfer, and KI (Brewster, Suutari &amp; Minbaeva, 2005;Cabrera &amp; Cabrera, 2005;Foss, Minbaeva, Pedersen, &amp; Reinholt, 2009;Minbaeva, Foss &amp; Snell, 2009;Minbaeva et al., 2003;Minbaeva, 2013;Palmatier, Dant, Grewal, &amp; Evans, 2006). HRM practices create a social context for knowledge management processes as these practices support the key mechanisms of direction and routines for effective KI (Chinying Lang, 2004;Soliman &amp; Spooner, 2000;Oltra, 2005). The relationship between knowledge management processes and HRM for innovation and other performance outcomes has been noted in recent studies (Kianto, Sáenz, &amp; Aramburu, 2017;Rupietta &amp; Backes-Gellner, 2017).</p>
        <p>While the above studies have enhanced our understanding of the role of HRM in the knowledge management process, we know relatively little about how HRM influences KI in the context of outsourcing firms, particularly from a vendor and foreign subsidiary perspective. This is the core focus and contribution this study offers. Mukherjee et al. (2017), for example, note that offshore outsourcing firms have different motives for knowledge related outcomes such as knowledge replication, refinement, renewal, and recombination.</p>
        <p>They note that the success of these outcomes depends on a firm's knowledge skills and capabilities as well as client-supplier relations. Successful KI in such contexts is difficult due to cooperation and coordination challenges between the two contracting parties and parentsubsidiary relationships (Johansson, Axelson, Enberg &amp; Tell, 2013;Söderlund &amp; Tell, 2013).</p>
        <p>The challenges are greater if buyers and vendors have vastly diverging cultural backgrounds and access to different knowledge and capability markets (Hofstede, 2001). To this end, this study provides a better understanding of meso-level contextual factors that affect KI in high technology firms. More specifically, as specialist knowledge, especially tacit specialist knowledge resides inside the minds of individuals, it is therefore critical to understand how firms apply (and integrate) such knowledge to their productive function. This paper argues for a critical role of key HRM practices employed by a firm to serve as enabling mechanisms for individuals to apply their knowledge to an organisation's production function. This study offers a distinctive theoretical contribution to the theoretical body strategic HRM and KI by identifying the key ability, motivation and opportunity enhancing HRM practices for achieving the goals of KI. This contribution is much needed as there is limited theoretical basis for understanding how HRM practices influence KI.</p>
        <p>Research on this topic is critical as studies of High-Performance Work Systems suggest that bundles of HRM practices are central in creating and applying knowledge skills and abilities to an organisation's productive function for achieving sustained competitive advantage. Our study identifies key bundles of HRM practices for influencing KI goals in high-technology knowledge-intensive firms. To this end, and in line with the literature on HRM (Boxall &amp; Purcell, 2016), we argue for a collective implementation of bundle of HRM practices to variously affect KI outcomes. The underpinning logic advanced here is that HRM practices create a social context through which efficient, effective and flexible integration of knowledge is possible. Thus, in the context of high-technology offshore IT subsidiaries and vendors in India, this study aims to answer two specific research questions: (1) what are the key HRM practices that influence knowledge integration?; and (2) why are some subsidiary and vendors firms better at integrating knowledge than others?</p>
        <p>Overall, this study offers three contributions. First, we offer new insights of how the goals of KI are achieved given the intricate relationships between buyers and vendors by moving the discussion from a buyer's perspective from advanced countries to a vendor perspective from an emerging market context (Lacity et al., 2010). Second, responding to the calls by Minbaeva (2008) andGarau et al., (2015), we contribute to the literature on international HRM and knowledge management by focusing on HRM practices for achieving KI goals.</p>
        <p>Employing a knowledge-and resource-based view (Barney, 1991;Grant, 1996 a, b) and utilising the ability, motivation and opportunity (AMO) framework (Blumberg &amp; Pringle, 1982;Boxall &amp; Purcell, 2015;Vroom, 1964), this study analyses and identifies the bundle of AMO-enhancing practices that influence KI (Minbaeva, 2013). Third, using an inductive qualitative case design, we develop a conceptual model to understand the relationship between AMO-enhancing practices that lead to efficiency, effectiveness and flexibility of KI, combining their hard (work/organisational design) and soft (by creating organisational values of open-mindedness and questioning the assumptions of information shared) aspects.</p>
        <p>The rest of the paper is structured as follows. First, a review the literature of knowledge management processes-especially of KI and HRM practices is presented. Second, details of the methodological strategy employed is next. Third, the analysis and findings are presented.</p>
        <p>Finally, the paper offers a discussion and conclusion, with implications for theory and practice, highlighting the limitations of this study.</p>
        <p>Owing to the increased importance of knowledge-based assets, the last two decades has witnessed extensive research that focuses on knowledge management processes such as knowledge acquisition, creation, sharing, transfer and integration and various facets of firm performance (e.g. Grandori &amp; Kogut, 2002;Grant, 1996 a,b;Hansen, 1999;McFayden &amp; Cannella, 2004;Minabeva, 2013;Scarborough, 2003). This paper, however, focuses on KI, a critical knowledge management process that can be a source of sustained competitive advantage (Henderson &amp; Clark, 1990;Grant, 1996a, b;Grandori, 2001;Okhuysen &amp; Eisenhardt, 2002). Using a general systems model of inputs, process and outputs, Berggren et al. (2013) state that the primary inputs to the KI processes are a firm's knowledge base, which enables it to achieve its goals or intended outcomes of efficiency, effectiveness and flexibility of KI. By integrating such knowledge bases, firms can deliver develop new knowledge bases needed for developing new processes and products. Existing or new knowledge inputs undergo a transformation process, wherein KI process are affected by a range of contextual and organisational factors. A key outcome of KI is the "physical or informational integration of knowledge in products, processes, systems, services, and solutions" (Berggren et al. 2013: p.9). See Figure 1 for a simple depiction of this idea.</p>
        <p>&lt; Insert Figure 1 about here &gt; Although Grant (1996 a, b) acknowledges two common contextual factors that serve as mechanisms for KIdirections and routines, there are several other multi-level organisational factors that affect KI goals of efficiency, scope and flexibility of KI. In his work, Grant notes that efficiency of KI can be achieved by having a (1) level of shared knowledge and shared norms; (2) frequency and variability of task performance; and (3) an appropriate organisational structure. Similarly, scope of KI can be enhanced by increasing (1) different types of specialised knowledge as it supports causal ambiguity; and (2) sequential and reciprocal interdependence of tasks between teams. Finally, flexibility of KI can be strengthened through (1) extending specialist knowledge base; and (2) reconfiguring existing pools of specialist knowledge into new organisational capabilities. In other words, KI should be efficient, its scope should be broad enough so it can applied to a wider set of productive tasks and it should be a source of flexibility for renewing and recombining the existing knowledge base with new and complementary specialist knowledge.</p>
        <p>Embedded in the mechanisms for achieving efficiency, scope and flexibility of KI are aspects of direction, sequencing enhancing complementary specialist knowledge base and creating routines that support integration. For example, employing a common language and shared norms standardise interactions between employees. Sequencing encourages interdependence between employees, typically through the use of cross-functional team design and application of team members' complementary skills. Routines are relatively complex patterns of behaviours that allow employees to operate in a predictable fashion.</p>
        <p>Although Grant identifies the antecedents of KI goals, this study advances a case for how AMO-enhancing practices helps firm achieve KI. Thus, using the logic of equifinality (Van de Ven, &amp; Drazin, 1985) and our above assertions, we argue that a bundle of strategic HRM practices influence KI will further develop the state of theory in KI and strategic HRM and inform practitioners with additional applications for developing such a capability.</p>
        <p>As noted above, the efficiency of KI can be enhanced by the processes that increases collective knowledge and how frequently such knowledge can be applied for completing the productive tasks of a firm. Firms need to have a common language for sharing its explicit knowledge, establish behavioural norms for supporting it, and encouraging team members for efficiently integrating knowledge it in various projects.</p>
        <p>Scope of KI requires firms to acquire and apply complementary specialist knowledge to its daily routines. Scope of knowledge increases the social complexity and causal ambiguity, which are critical aspects of a resource-based view of the firm (Barney, 1991). Through sequential interdependence of workflow scope of KI can be enhanced as employees with specialist knowledge apply their knowledge to interdependent productive tasks in socially complex work interactions (Grant, 1996a).</p>
        <p>Finally, flexibility of KI is possible by extending existing knowledge base and reconfiguring it with existing or new forms of specialist and shared knowledge. Formal process that support how groups share common and specialist knowledge with other group members and apply it to productive routines enhances the flexibility of KI (Okhuysen &amp; Eisenhardt, 2002). Grant suggests that some of this is possible by making specialist tacit knowledge explicit or looking for new common and specialist knowledge that is not in an organisation's immediate productive ecosystem. Several sources such as suppliers, partners, clients, customers and academic institutions enhance the flexibility of KI. By combining existing internal and external pools of common and specialist knowledge new architectural knowledge, for example, for innovation, can be integrated (Henderson &amp; Clark, 1990).</p>
        <p>Following an extensive review of the literature of KI, Tell (2013) summarised KI to incorporate three key activities: 1) sharing of knowledge; 2) the relatedness and relevance of knowledge to a work context; and 3) the ability of firms to combine or recombine existing and new specialist and complementary knowledge for its productive work tasks. While the latter two activities are critical to KI (Grant, 1996a), knowledge sharing can be inefficient as not all sharing of knowledge leads to its application. Firms that are adept in embedding and repeating KI routines are known to possess KI capability. Our focus therefore, as Grant noted (1996a) is on integrating specialist knowledge for completing discrete productive tasks that help firms create value by transforming inputs into outputs.</p>
        <p>Extant research also suggests that relevant and sometimes unconnected and isolated specialist knowledge resides in individual members of a team (Okhuysen &amp; Eisenhardt, 2002) as do organisational level explanations of knowledge processes (Felin &amp; Hesterly, 2007;Foss, 2007). Thus, for this paper, organisational-level AMO-enhancing HRM and work practices are need for understanding how individual level knowledge (Minbaeva, 2013) can support the main goals of KI.</p>
        <p>Although number of studies that have explored the impact of HRM and work practices on knowledge management processes such as knowledge sharing and knowledge transfer (Brewster et al., 2005;Cabrera &amp; Cabrera, 2005;Foss et al., 2009;Minbaeva et al., 2009;Minbaeva,et al., 2003;Minbaeva, 2013), recent studies have started to explore its relationship with KI (Garaus et al., 2015;Hayton, &amp; Macchitella, 2013). The importance of social context and managerial practices such as those embodied in HRM are critical in integrating specialist knowledge (Kang et al., 2007;Smith et al., 2005). Depending on the nature of managerial approaches and business model followed by knowledge intensive firms in the IT industry, the nature and extent to which new and specialist knowledge is integrated varies (Malik &amp; Rowley, 2015). Furthermore, formal and informal approaches to learning and development are central in integrating new and existing knowledge for performing discrete tasks and or working across interdependent cross-functional project teams (Collins, 2001;Kang et al., 2007;Verona 1999). Offer of team-based rewards can further support integration of knowledge for performing interdependent tasks (Gomez-Mejia &amp; Balkin, 1989).</p>
        <p>AMO-enhancing practices is regarded as a robust framework in the field of HRM.</p>
        <p>Implementing AMO-enhancing HRM practices can create a social context for better organisational and individual level performance (Blumberg &amp; Pringle, 1982). To this end, numerous studies have attempted to identify a system of HRM practices, which focuses on enhancing ability and motivation of employees and the opportunity to apply the skills (Applebaum et al., 2000;Kehoe &amp; Wright, 2013). For example, Kehoe and Wright (2013) noted training, selective hiring and structured interviews as key ability-enhancing HRM practices. Selectively hiring people with right skills, ability, culture-fit and attitude is vital for work teams' ability to integrate diverse knowledge bases (Carbrera &amp; Carbrera, 2005;Grandori &amp; Soda, 1995), especially as traditional approaches to recruitment and selection are considered less effective in developing specific knowledge (Currie &amp; Kerrin, 2003;Scarbrough, 2003). Prior experience, specialist knowledge and skills has been linked to effective knowledge sharing (Chang et al., 2012;Haas &amp; Hansen, 2007). Cross-functional and team-based training, orientation and socialisation programmes have also been noted to positively impact knowledge sharing (Carbrera &amp; Carbrera, 2005;Kang, Morris &amp; Snell, 2007;Yamao et al., 2009). Kehoe and Wright (2013) note internal and external rewards and performance management as key motivation-enhancing HRM practices. Gagné (2009) provided an extensive review of HRM practices that motivate employees to share knowledge.</p>
        <p>In a similar vein, Foss et al. (2009) highlighted the importance of external rewards in improving knowledge sharing behaviours, especially when employees value such external rewards. Similarly, team-based designs and the ability to interact with group members has a positive impact on knowledge exchange between employees (Hansen 1999). Finally, work design that supports empowerment and involvement of employees, contributes to individual and group decision-making or problem-solving is seen as an opportunity-enhancing HRM practice. Although HRM practices have been linked to several knowledge management processes (Minbaeva, 2013;Minbaeva et al., 2003Minbaeva et al., , 2009) ) in inter-and intra-organisational settings, very few have focused on linking a bundle of AMO-enhancing HRM practices, as key antecedents of KI goals. This paper develops a conceptual framework for understanding such relationships (Figure 2). &lt; Insert Figure 2 about here &gt;</p>
        <p>Considering the nature of research questions, Eisenhardt's (1989) suggestion of adopting an inductive approach is appropriate. An inductive approach is desirable where there are opportunities for building, extending or refining an existing theory by observing the phenomenon in a novel context. Table 1 provides the descriptive details of the case organisations. Of the seven case organisations in the sample, four organisations (Cases A-D) are from the Business-and Knowledge-process outsourcing industry whereas three organisations (Cases E-G) are offering IT products and IT services to the global IT industry. Within this mix, there are three third-party service providers (cases B, D and F) and four are subsidiaries of UK or US MNCs (cases A, C, E and G). Descriptive details about the cases and interviewees are provided in Tables 1 and2. High-technology knowledge-intensive IT firms often need to integrate, on an ongoing basis, new types of specialist knowledge. The nature of such knowledge is challenging due to geographical distance and resultant coordination and cooperation issues between a client and its service provider or the parentsubsidiary dyad. Further, experts hold specialist knowledge across borders can integrate such knowledge through expatriation and job rotation assignments.</p>
        <p>&lt; Insert Tables 1 and2 about here &gt;</p>
        <p>In addition to qualitative semi-structured interview data from 59 employees, HR and training managers, CEO/COO, business development, and quality management managers from the case study organisations, secondary data from public domain, organisational documents and policies data were also analysed (See Table 2 for interviewee details). On average, the interviews ranged from 60 to 120 minutes and were transcribed verbatim.</p>
        <p>The analysis involved two stages. First, an unstructured analysis of case study data of transcripts was undertaken using 
            <rs type="software">Leximancer</rs>-
            <rs type="version">4</rs>, a specialist content analysis software. Next, akin to the conventional qualitative analysis, an abductive approach was employed for identifying second order themes from the first-order data concepts. This stage involved a more targeted theoretical coding using an iterative process of linking the initial concepts and codes to the AMO literature for identifying second order themes and then seeking evidence of how these variously influenced the goals of KI.
        </p>
        <p>
            <rs type="software">Leximancer</rs>-4 enables automated extraction of seed concepts using machine learning, statistical processes (Grech et al., 2002;Smith &amp; Humphreys, 2006) and validated algorithms (Metropolis, Rosenbluth, Rosenbluth, Teller &amp; Teller, 1953). The application analyses: (i) frequency counts and relational co-occurrence of text in a two-sentence block, which leads to auto-identification of key concepts and themes; and (ii) produces conceptual maps depicting the relationships between different themes and concepts (Smith &amp; Humphreys, 2006).The application's statistical rigour reduces researcher bias typically associated with manual coding in qualitative research (Smith 2003). Hence, it is not surprising to see applications of this approach in applied disciplines such as HRM (Malik et al., 2017), marketing management (Dann, 2010), international business and psychology (Liesch et al., 2011).
        </p>
        <p>Using a non-selective program, the application analyses words by concepts from a transcript using synonyms, relationships and its frequencies (Harwood, Gapp &amp; Stewart, 2015). The resultant concepts and themes are clustered as conceptual words (Cretchley et al., 2010) after undergoing about 1000 interactions of the data (Harwood et al., 2015). Following the automatic generation of concepts, the editing function was employed to merge concepts and plural words, for example, 'process' and 'processes' into 'processes' and 'client', 'customer' and 'clients' into 'clients' and so on. This process was followed by an analysis of seed concepts and themes and its relationship with other sub-concepts and themes using conceptual map, textual exploration and frequency hierarchies relevant for this paper.</p>
        <p>Following several iterations, a stable and re-clustered concept and theme map is presented (See Figure 3). The themes are re-labelled based on the meaning found through exploration of concepts in that group of thematic data. The maps depict themes (as circles) and concepts (as points). Regarding heat map relevancies, red circle depicts the most dominant theme, followed by shades of brown and green, and icy blue, such that shades of blue depict a somewhat less related theme in the context of the data set. The size and proximity of themes also matter, wherein, the further away a theme is from another theme, the relative similarity of the theme/concept in the context of the data set, reduces. The lines depict the path between concepts. Forty-three concepts and eleven themes were auto-generated by the software.</p>
        <p>Since the goals of KI were not directly measured in this study, data exploration focused on analysing theoretical concepts of AMO-enhancing HRM and workflow design practices and how these shape the efficiency, scope and flexibility of KI (Grant, 1996a). To this end, the auto-generated concept seed of 'knowledge' was explored further to understand how this concept was related to other themes and concepts (Figure 4 provides a snapshot of key relationships). The concept of 'knowledge' was part of the theme of 'business requirements'.</p>
        <p>Exploration of this concept at a within-and cross-theme level provided an account of how knowledge was integrated in the productive function or business requirements. Analysis also suggests that organisations access and apply knowledge through organisational processes, a view that was established by March (1991: p. 73) wherein "procedures, norms, rules and other forms" of knowledge grows by its application and use by individuals in an organisational system. Figure 4 shows that the concept of knowledge is related to other concepts of process-, client-, team-, project-, product-, quality-and business-knowledge as well as, not surprisingly, to the themes of training, scale, duration, clients and people.</p>
        <p>Further exploration of 'knowledge' concept and its relationship with other concepts and themes was also undertaken.</p>
        <p>Following an initial automated analysis of 43 concepts and 11 themes, further theoretical coding was undertaken using abductive logic. This approach followed an iterative process of using the preliminary codes from stage one and exploring these further to link it back to the literature (Van Mannen, Sorensen &amp; Mitchell, 2007) on AMO framework. Such an approach allowed us to explore how elements of AMO framework variously influenced the goals of KI.</p>
        <p>Using the preliminary automated analysis of first-order seed concepts or categories, the next stage of analysis progressively identified specific AMO-enhancing practices (second-order themes) that supported efficiency, scope and flexibility of KI (aggregate dimensions) (Gioa, Corley &amp; Hamilton, 2012). Figure 5 depicts the relationship between the first-order concepts, second-order themes and the aggregate dimensions of goals of KI, which are further explained in the next section. &lt; Insert Figures 3,4 and 5 about here &gt;</p>
        <p>We identified several HRM practices influencing the goals of KI. While these practices differed in emphases at an individual case level, there were similarities in the content of the AMO-enhancing HRM practices across the cases. The findings are presented based on the relationship between goals of KI and how these were variously influenced by AMOenhancing HRM practices. The empirical data structure guiding this analysis is presented in Figure 5 along with supporting examples of quotes for each theoretically developed second order theme in Table 5. The following section provides a detailed analysis of different AMOenhancing HRM practices and it effect on KI (see Tables 3 and4 for details).</p>
        <p>&lt; Insert Table 3, 4 and 5 about here &gt;</p>
        <p>The findings suggest that efficiency of KI was achieved through HRM practices of investing in training and development (ability), focused hiring (ability), competency-based performance management (motivation) and team working (opportunity). We discuss each of the HRM practices in the detail.</p>
        <p>From the list of 43 seed concepts, first-order concepts of training, people, person, skills, job, knowledge and time (See Figure 5) suggested the second-order theme of investing in training and development and focused hiring for KI relevant for time-bound software development projects. The standardised and modular nature of training and hiring specifications is suggestive of a common vocabulary, a 'rule-like' and 'process-driven' (Grant, 1996a) mechanism for achieving efficiency of KI. This analytical process was followed iteratively for all theoretical second-order AMO-enhancing themes and aggregate dimensions using input data from the first-order seed concepts. For example, Organisations A, E, F and G invested significant amounts in training and development due to their volume and diversity of projects, encompassing a range of industries and specialisations. All four firms had set up their corporate universities in India and globally, focusing on providing several common and specialist knowledge modules.</p>
        <p>In order to recoup their local and global training investments, these four firms routinely hired graduate engineers and associates. These graduates were put through a very structured</p>
        <p>First-order concepts of business, work, specific, process, product, things, skills, knowledge, role and quality (See Figure 5) suggested the importance of efficiently integrating role-and project-specific knowledge through the use of common behavioural norms of (Grant, 1996a) competency-based performance management (second-order theme). Such an approach integrates employees common and specialist knowledge using internal and external sources (e.g. clients) of trainers. For example, the process associates and software engineers in these firms were motivated to perform at higher levels and become proficient in client-, project-and domain-specific knowledge to service their clients. This performance approach was strengthened by the use of standardised quality management processes and performance measures employing, for example, Six-Sigma methodologies.</p>
        <p>we also tried to create much more matrix oriented performance review. So, we have created a global dashboard. Whatever you call it, it essentially means that we can take a simple parameter like performance or utilisation of an individual. …if an employee's utilisation is less than 80%, he/she is not qualified to get a CRR 1 [a high rating]. HR Manager (Org F)</p>
        <p>In line with Hayton and Macchitella's ( 2013) study, the focus on only individual attributes may only lend support to efficiency of KI and acquisition. However, by adopting a more collectivist and a shared cultural approach, higher levels of KI are possible.</p>
        <p>The first-order concepts of people, teams, organisation, group, processes, knowledge, project, doing and happens (Figure 5), shows extensive use of team working (second-order theme) as a deliberate strategy to minimise duplication of tasks and creating an opportunity for employees to deepen their knowledge in areas with knowledge gaps. Deeper domain and vertical-specific knowledge was developed through the use of cross-functional teams, processes and project teams. Also by providing employees, internal and external performance feedback at a team level, specialist and complementary knowledge base was strengthened.</p>
        <p>Teams are related to a project…have a direct relationship with increasing the productivity of the process ….you are at a certain level but now you need to think more of project improvements and look at [the] training related to this, so that you can take the performance from a desirable level X to X plus 10%. Manager Quality (Org. C)</p>
        <p>The use of shared behavioural norms and project-and group-specific team working (Grant, 1996a) ensured efficient integration of common and specialist knowledge.</p>
        <p>The scope of KI can be enhanced by cross-functional sharing and coordination of knowledge within and across units, accessing different pools of specialist and complementary knowledge and applying it to IT and BPO projects. Through sequential and reciprocal interdependence the scope of knowledge integration can be achieved (Grant, 1996a). The findings suggest that the scope of KI was achieved by AMOenhancing HRM practices of project-based information dissemination (motivation), competency-based performance measurement (motivation), information and knowledge sharing forums (opportunity) and verticalisation of business units (opportunity).</p>
        <p>The first-order concepts of project, specific, particular, examples, different, process, technical, and knowledge (See Figure 5) suggests that project-based information and dissemination (second-order theme) occurs for critical knowledge of different performance dimensions for each project. Project managers' and employees' competency-based performance measurement (second-order theme) metrics suggest there are particular mandates for sharing, capturing and disseminating project-specific knowledge through numerous directed activities such as: cross-functional team meetings, team briefings, brown bag lunch sessions, white paper sharing and developing 'critical to quality' performance dashboards, shared within the team and sometimes across geographies in a similar domain.</p>
        <p>The following quotation illustrates reciprocal interdependence in information dissemination: Application of different pools of common and specialist knowledge held by employees and project leaders from different projects covering a range of performance dimensions, enhanced the scope of KI (Grant, 1996a).</p>
        <p>The first-order concepts of different, knowledge, people, product, project, organisation, change, and particular (See Figure 5) suggests that larger firms undertook structural changes to move to a 'verticalisation' approach to engage in mutual information and knowledge sharing (second-order themes). Verticalisation of business refers to a structure which at a higher level is industry-based, followed by geographyspecific structures for a given area of specialisation. For example, a firm's business may specialise in delivering networking technologies and IT infrastructure management for the Telecom industry. The firm allocates its knowledge and resources in this area, first, creating an industry-level structure, and then builds further expertise, in the same area of specialisation, drawing upon knowledge from different geographical areas e.g. knowledge from the Americas, Europe, UK, Middle East and North Africa, Asia and so on. Such a structure allows firms to fully leverage the knowledge that resides both within its local industry specialisation i.e. Telecom, but also across its geographically dispersed business units.</p>
        <p>…creation of independent business units [IBUs], creation of verticals has been a big change…. So that's has been pushed down into IBU level which is a fairly strong structural readjustment with the company's view…. So the separate IBU's would be different verticals ….capital markets, banking, retail, communication service providers, product engineering… and the service lines will cut across both the IBU's and as well as the geographic units [e.g. Americas, Europe, MENA] VP-</p>
        <p>Such an approach increases the scope of knowledge integration as firms share different pools of geography-and industry-specific knowledge and share information for applying specialist knowledge to a wide range of performance dimensions (Grant, 1996a). Different sets of organisational values and routines facilitated collaboration, coordination and interactions between employees, teams, clients and equipment suppliers. For example, Organisation A had a strong metrics-driven culture using its Six Sigma capabilities. These capabilities were embedded in daily routines of this firm. As noted by Organisation A's manager:</p>
        <p>Six Sigma (SS) is a culture, it is the way we work, …it is not a drive that happens and then people pack up their bags once the drive is over. It does not work that way. The way you start working is driven by the way SS runs, so as a part of the control, let's say, my project is an insurance process. To increase the number of transactions, increase the number of applications processed per FTE,…I will look at putting in some improvements in place, as a part of SS one has to put in some dashboards in place. Not only this, a monitoring system has to be in place and a review mechanism also needs to be in place.</p>
        <p>Flexibility of KI not only requires deepening and updating of current knowledge bases but it also involves reconfiguring existing complementary knowledge to develop innovative products, processes and services through its internal and external knowledge bases (Grant, 1996a). Our findings suggest that flexibility of KI can be enhanced through the second order theme of knowledge questioning values (ability), geographical information and knowledge sharing and dealing with structural change (opportunity).</p>
        <p>The first-order concepts of quality, client, specific, error and process (See Figure 5) suggested that the larger organisations (e.g. A, E, F G and C) invested heavily in induction programs that focused on knowledge questioning values (second-order theme). Knowledge questioning values challenge status quo and untested business and client assumptions. Such approaches involve adopting an open mind to questioning the clients' theory-in-use and their business assumptions by demonstrating a superior understanding of performative knowledge in one's area of expertise (Malik &amp; Rowley, 2015;Malik et al., 2012;Sinkula et al., 1997). Such values often rely on informal knowledge sharing, using prior and already established quality management and performance metrics, thereby extending existing knowledge bases and searches for complementary knowledge, at a within-and across-industry domains and functional specialisations, from both, the clients' side and the MNC's global network of subsidiaries. Developing a strong set cultural values was evident at Organisation G:</p>
        <p>Whatever happens at Organisation G is right, whatever happens else it does not matter. We have a strong culture, and it is very important for people to integrate with this. I will call it like reintegrating with Organisation G, because everything that you do has a particular Organisation G way, and when you are talking to global teams, you have to follow certain Organisation G ways. You should have it else you are not adequately dedicated so whether it is conducting the virtual meeting or doing anything that need to follow on. People have to make sure things like timelines etc. This [culture] is a part of Organisation G, very, very Organisation G way.</p>
        <p>Finally, the first-order concepts of process, knowledge, people, product, project, organisation, change and particular, suggest that for flexibility of KI, firms are sharing geographical knowledge and information through structural changes (second-order themes) across the network of operations of both Indian and global MNCs. The knowledge base of clients also complements the transfer and application of specialist knowledge from the network of subsidiaries. It is through a unique combination of both these types of knowledge that firms can renew, extend and reconfigure their knowledge bases to achieve flexibility of KI.</p>
        <p>…. Organisation G had always believed and told the customer that 'megahertz is it'! The faster you [the processor] go, the better. From the processor mindset we are moving towards to platformisation paradigm where we are saying that faster need not necessarily be better.</p>
        <p>? This is the mindset change that R&amp;D organisations need to capture in their approach to design and development. The second mindset change that has to come is that US is not the centre of universe, where 60 % of the work used to come from the US earlier, now it is likely to be more geographically dispersed.

        <p>This study investigated the relationship between how HRM practices influence KI. Given the complexities associated with inter-and intra-firm coordination and cooperation, this study found firms develop a standardised and process-driven workflow design, which is typical of several knowledge-intensive firms (Malik et al., 2012;Malik &amp; Rowley, 2015;Zollo &amp; Winter, 2002). The critical mechanisms of direction, sequencing, and routines (Grant, 1996a) were in evident in the sample of firms. The presence of a bundle of AMO-enhancing HRM practices for achieving KI suggests that several socially complex and causally ambiguous resources and processes were supporting the application of knowledge. In line with earlier studies of HRM practices, investment in training (Cabrera &amp; Cabrera, 2005;Chang et al., 2012;Haas &amp; Hansen, 2007;Kang et al., 2007), focused hiring (Cabrera &amp; Cabrera, 2005) team-based designs (Hansen, 1999) information sharing between parent firm, clients and network partners (Hayton &amp; Macchitella, 2013;Sinkula et al., 1997) and having a strategic approach to performance management (Swart &amp; Kinnie 2003) was present in the sample and supported KI (Tell, 2013).</p>
        <p>The unique and novel finding of this study lies in identifying a bundle of AMO-enhancing HRM practices for supporting the goals of KI. Specifically, three bundles of HRM practices enhance efficiency, scope and flexibility of KI. For example, KI goals of scope and flexibility were enriched by: novel work/organisational design and building a culture that values knowledge sharing and open-mindedness or knowledge-questioning values. We posit these HRM practices create an overall socio-cultural system that enables the formation of automatic routines for shared application of new and existing specialist knowledge. Through the promotion of organisational values of critical confrontation, cross-functional team sharing and learning, continuous learning, competence-based rewards and project-specific adherence to business specifications created a social and cultural context for developing organisational routines. This cultural context supported the scope and flexibility of KI.</p>
        <p>Employing a novel organisational structure, which at its lowest level of task and knowledge, was organised around client-, project-and process-specific teamwork. Such an approach was logical not only because of client's contractual stipulations, but also to understand the knowledge of client's project-specific standard operating practices. The structure of teams was clustered around 'industries' (verticals or verticalisation as noted in the findings) and areas of specialisation (horizontals) -a vertical structure required domainspecific knowledge whereas horizontal structures needed specialist technical knowledge.</p>
        <p>Such structures seemed logical in the context of larger firms as it provided them with the opportunity to share, apply and integrate knowledge from the same vertical (e.g. banking sector) and specialisation (e.g. auditing) areas, to different client accounts in the same vertical and specialisation (i.e. auditing in the banking sector). This structural design enriched the scope of knowledge integration. Further, work was designed to leverage new knowledge from different geographies by creating a structure by verticals and specialisations serving different set of industries and specialisations in a particular geography.</p>
        <p>Such an approach developed context-specific knowledge and provided an opportunity to leverage specialist knowledge within the same vertical and horizontal as well as across different geographies. This approach improved flexibility of KI. In the context of large MNCs, knowledge transfer was also facilitated by the international HRM practices of expatriate assignments (Minbaeva, 2007). There was no support found for the differences in KI between inter-and intra-organisational firms. However, firms that had a more formalised and evolved workflow design and process methodologies (such as Organisations A, E, F and G), also had better AMO-enhancing HRM and work practices. As a consequence, they were able to achieve higher levels of KI, than the smaller and younger organisations (Organisations B, C and D). This finding is presented in Table 4.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, in answering the first research question, eleven HRM practices variously impacted the key goals of KI (See Table 3). For the study's second question, the study found firms that did not have well-developed routines for standardisation of workflow and developing process-driven approach to project management (Organisations B, C and D) had poorly developed HRM practices (See Table 4). As such, this affected their ability to integrate knowledge. The findings also suggest that there were interactions between different AMO-enhancing HRM practices for integrating different types of specialist knowledge. The diversity of AMO-enhancing practices' impact on KI outcomes has implications for theory and practice. As the interdependence is high in this industry, managers must focus on not only the combined implementation of the above AMO-enhancing practices, they should also pay greater attention to how these practices are implemented.</p>
        <p>The results also show that firms in the global IT industry can benefit from HRM designs that focus on developing standardised software competencies for delivering efficiency in integrating specialist and common knowledge through a common language and routines. This finding has implications for job design theories: logically ordering key tasks and determining their interdependency with other tasks, the nature of knowledge that is required, is critical for efficiency of KI. For example, in an offshore outsourcing context of IT firms, tasks are highly complex, uncertain and have higher levels of heterogeneity. As such, these tasks require greater streamlining for better coordination and cooperation for successful KI (Brusoni &amp; Cassi, 2009;Carlie &amp; Rebentisch, 2003;Grandori, 2001). Similarly, depending on the nature of knowledge: tacit or explicit, internal or external, shared or differentiated, related or unrelated, the extent of effort required and planning needed for KI will vary (Edmondson &amp; Harvey, 2017;Dibiaggio, 2007). In other words, knowledge that is tacit, differentiated and unrelated often requires greater effort for its integration. Managers can achieve efficiency and scope of KI through sequential and reciprocal interdependence, whereas for flexibility of KI, interactions between local and global teams is critical. Therefore, managers must continue to invest in process excellence to gain a better understanding of the workflow and knowledge of performance metrics relevant to client projects in a given area of specialisation and industry. This was borne out in the verticalisation of business structures. The above finding has implications for practice.</p>
        <p>Managers must promote the creation of social context that helps build strong social capital among the actors in a system. Increased levels of collaboration and interaction between employees and other groups facilitates KI, as does the development of a collective and shared identity of employees. The ability to form and access knowledge within and across networks is a critical aspect of design for effective KI. Therefore, it becomes imperative to manage key people who have strong ties in such networks as they have access to valuable specialist and complementary knowledge. From a theoretical viewpoint, the conventional theories of network analysis and job design can benefit from an integrative understanding of the above network dynamics and how it supports KI. These symbolic artefacts encourages the development of a common language and therefore facilitates the ease with social, cultural and relational environment enables effective KI. Future research is needed on how different forms of social, organisational and professional identities and leadership and management styles can have a moderating effect on the goals and outcomes of KI.</p>
        <p>Given the limited scope of this study (i.e. single industry and national context), future research can confirm the relationships outlined in this study's conceptual model by employing ex-post facto designs and longitudinal in-depth qualitative case studies. We note our findings are not be generalizable to the broader population but argue for its transferability to KI literature and believe it has some application within the global IT/BPO industry owing to some convergence in HRM and knowledge management practices through the use of standardised international quality management frameworks and software development protocols. Future studies could explore the relationships between micro-foundations of HRM, high-performance work systems and KI in different contexts, especially the relatively underexplored contexts of public service and social enterprises. Further, as the focus in this industry is on project teams, future research could focus on cross-border team dynamics and individuals in cross-functional teams, employing additional theoretical lens of power, trust and politics that are critical in extracting tacit specialist knowledge and integrating it to an organisation's productive function.</p>
