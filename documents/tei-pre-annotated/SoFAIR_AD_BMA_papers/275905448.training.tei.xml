        <p>In this paper, we build on social cognitive career theory to examine the relation between entrepreneurial intention and new venture creation (i.e., the entrepreneurial career choice). We model how contextual influences at different levels may favor or inhibit the translation of entrepreneurial intentions into new venture creation. Using unique longitudinal data from almost the entire population of Italian university graduates, we are able to assess how the immediate (i.e., the influence of relevant others) and larger context (i.e., organizational and environmental influences) affect new venture creation. Our research contributes to the emerging literature of the intention-behavior link in entrepreneurship.In this paper, we build on social cognitive career theory to examine the relation between entrepreneurial intention and new venture creation (i.e., the entrepreneurial career choice).

        <p>The labor market has changed drastically in recent years. Workforce diversity, rapid technological changes, and increased globalization have transformed traditional organizational structures and work environments, leading to important changes in how individuals enact their careers (Sullivan and Baruch, 2009). As such, entrepreneurship is becoming a popular career option among younger generations, not least among university students (Edelman et al., 2016).The labor market has changed drastically in recent years.

        <p>Universities increasingly support such activities and scholars have started examining student entrepreneurship, often proxying it with the formation of entrepreneurial intentions (e.g., Criaco et al., 2017;Souitaris et al., 2007;Zellweger et al., 2011). Yet, recent research suggests that while many form entrepreneurial intentions, only a small fraction turn these intentions into any type of entrepreneurial behaviors (Goethner et al., 2012;Joensuu-Salo et al., 2015;Kautonen et al., 2015b;Rauch and Hulsink, 2015), let alone choosing entrepreneurship as their career1 . Thus, there is a growing interest in understanding the relationship between entrepreneurial intention and new venture creation. In this paper, we contribute to this developing literature.Universities increasingly support such activities and scholars have started examining student entrepreneurship, often proxying it with the formation of entrepreneurial intentions (e.g., Criaco et al., 2017;Souitaris et al., 2007;Zellweger et al., 2011).

        <p>The theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991;2011/2014) and the entrepreneurial event model (Shapero, 1984) are the main conceptual frameworks used to model the antecedents and consequences of entrepreneurial intentions. Although we agree that entrepreneurial intentions may constitute a necessary criterion for starting a new venture, we contend that they are not sufficient because other factors influence the extent to which entrepreneurial intentions turn into new venture creation. We therefore build on Bandura's social cognitive theory (e.g., Bandura, 1986), and specifically its application within the career literature (social cognitive career theory, [SCCT], see Lent and Brown, 2013;Lent, Brown, andHackett, 1994, 2000). This theory emphasizes how social context, in particular social modeling, complements internal motivations in driving behavior. As such, it provides a comprehensive theoretical framework, allowing us to assess under what conditions entrepreneurial intentions lead to new venture creation.The theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991;2011/2014) and the entrepreneurial event model (Shapero, 1984) are the main conceptual frameworks used to model the antecedents and consequences of entrepreneurial intentions.

        <p>We develop a theoretical framework that differentiates between more or less proximal contexts and defines their influence in transforming university graduates' intentions into new venture creation. The more proximal contexts are represented by the set of social relationships surrounding the prospective entrepreneurs, who interact with their family, peers, and mentors looking for support, role-models and advice. The more distal context is represented by the larger economic environment where intentions are developed, where individuals consider the alternatives available, and where they make their career choices influenced by associated resource constraints and opportunities. In between are the universities where graduates have studied and where they have (or do not have) the opportunity to benefit from different types of support targeting entrepreneurial activities.We develop a theoretical framework that differentiates between more or less proximal contexts and defines their influence in transforming university graduates' intentions into new venture creation.

        <p>We tested our framework using 20,754 valid responses to a two-wave longitudinal survey that covered entrepreneurial intentions and new venture creation for about 1/3 of all students who graduated from 64 Italian universities in the fall of 2014. The responses to the questionnaires were complemented by university-level information on structures dedicated to supporting students' entrepreneurship, which was retrieved from a unique database that included repeated annual information on all Italian universities between 2000 and 2014, and the population of its 55,000 academics (Bolzani et al., 2014). Data on the environmental and regional characteristics were retrieved from the statistical office of the European Union.We tested our framework using 20,754 valid responses to a two-wave longitudinal survey that covered entrepreneurial intentions and new venture creation for about 1/3 of all students who graduated from 64 Italian universities in the fall of 2014.

        <p>Our study provides several contributions to the study of the intention-behavior link in entrepreneurship. First, we expand and enrich the focus of entrepreneurial intentions and how they contribute to generating new ventures by leveraging SCCT to examine and model the role of contextual variables. In particular, we provide a consistent and parsimonious framework for examining how entrepreneurial intentions, together with contextual variables, influence venture creation and we expand the singular focus on individual intentions inherent in other intention models. Entrepreneurs are socially embedded (Aldrich and Ruef, 2006;Dahl and Sorenson, 2009); the context in which they operate influences outcomes (Aldrich and Zimmer, 1986). We need to disentangle the effect of such contextual influences to properly identify their roles and drivers, as we do in this paper.Our study provides several contributions to the study of the intention-behavior link in entrepreneurship.

        <p>We therefore link it to the wider body of career literature, which considers the decision to create a new venture as one of many options available to individuals in their process of choosing a career (e.g., Burton et al., 2016). Hence, adopting a career perspective, we may consider entrepreneurship as a first step along a career path.We therefore link it to the wider body of career literature, which considers the decision to create a new venture as one of many options available to individuals in their process of choosing a career (e.g., Burton et al., 2016).

        <p>Third, by developing and testing our intentional model on university graduates, we add new knowledge to the growing literature on academic entrepreneurship. As noted above, graduating students are particularly important in terms of academic entrepreneurship (e.g., Astebro et al., 2012;Wright and Mustar., 2019) but are also unique. They are at a stage when they are 'forced' to make a career choice. Unlike earlier-stage students or employees, they are unable to procrastinate their engagement in entrepreneurship by continuing their studies or remaining with an employer. Such procrastination is otherwise common among other types of individuals (e.g., McMullen and Shepherd, 2006;van Gelderen et al., 2015). This brings particular salience to whether they act on their intentions. Understanding why they choose entrepreneurship as a career path is also relevant because initial career choices tend to have long-lasting implications for an individual's professional and personal life.Third, by developing and testing our intentional model on university graduates, we add new knowledge to the growing literature on academic entrepreneurship.

        <p>The creation of a new venture is often viewed as an intentional, planned behavior (e.g., Krueger, 1993;Krueger et al., 2000) and entrepreneurial intentions have therefore received extensive attention in the entrepreneurship literature (e.g., Bird, 1988;Kolvereid, 1996;Krueger, 1993;Krueger et al., 2000). This research is inspired by the broader body of intention literature, which generally finds reasonable correlations between intentions and subsequent behavior. For example, a meta-analysis of the theory of planned behavior (TPB, see Ajzen 1991Ajzen , 2011Ajzen /2014) ) shows that intentions explain between 20% and 30% of the variance in behavior (Armitrage and Connor, 2002). Similarly, another systematic review finds that across a range of behaviors intentions account for 28% of the variance on average (Sheeran, 2002). This means that 70% to 80% of the variance of how intentions are transformed into behaviors remains unexplained, suggesting an important role for additional explanatory factors (Sheeran, 2002).The creation of a new venture is often viewed as an intentional, planned behavior (e.g., Krueger, 1993;Krueger et al., 2000) and entrepreneurial intentions have therefore received extensive attention in the entrepreneurship literature (e.g., Bird, 1988;Kolvereid, 1996;Krueger, 1993;Krueger et al., 2000).

        <p>An important element to consider is that intentions can explain some behaviors better than others. Entrepreneurship is likely among those behaviors that are explained poorly by intentions alone. First, intentions predict behaviors better when related to a single action (e.g., exercise or dieting) than when representing the outcome of a series of actions performed over time (Sheeran, 2002). Moreover, intentions predict behaviors that are under strict volitional control (e.g., eating healthy) better than those influenced by external conditions or the actions of others (Sheeran, 2002). Next, intentions better predict behaviors that are simple (e.g., choosing a healthy menu option) rather than complex (Sheeran and Orbell, 2000). Finally, intentions better predict behaviors with ultimate outcomes that occur soon after the act (e.g., voting in an election) and with a relatively clear link between actions and outcomes (e.g., donating blood; e.g., Ajzen, 1991).An important element to consider is that intentions can explain some behaviors better than others.

        <p>Entrepreneurship meets few of the characteristics of behaviors that are strongly influenced by intentions because entrepreneurship is complex, consists of many actions, entails high uncertainty, is not under strict volitional control, and is characterized by a long lag between actions and outcomes. The intention-behavior link in the entrepreneurial context may therefore be weaker than in many other contexts (Orbeil et al., 1997), suggesting that intention alone is not an ideal predictor of entrepreneurial behavior.Entrepreneurship meets few of the characteristics of behaviors that are strongly influenced by intentions because entrepreneurship is complex, consists of many actions, entails high uncertainty, is not under strict volitional control, and is characterized by a long lag between actions and outcomes.

        <p>We therefore conducted a systematic review2 to locate the relevant literature (the resulting papers are presented in Table 1). Although the first applications of intentions and TPB in the entrepreneurship context hailed at least as far back as 1993 (i.e., Krueger and Carsrud, 1993), the first study examining how intentions influence entrepreneurial behavior was published as recently as 2012.We therefore conducted a systematic review2 to locate the relevant literature (the resulting papers are presented in Table 1).

        <p>To date, 13 empirical studies have been published. Four studies (i.e., Goethner et al., 2012;Joensuu-Salo et al., 2015;Kautonen et al., 2015b;Rauch and Hulsink, 2015) examined only the direct link between intentions and behavior. They found that intentions predict behavior, but the explanatory power of intentions was weak for the reasons we observe in our paper.To date, 13 empirical studies have been published.

        <p>The remaining studies tested the effect of moderators. One of these studies (Kautonen et al., 2013) provided justification for the interaction based on TPB (perceived behavior control is the moderator). The remaining ones drew on some alternative theories, or followed an empirical approach to identify the moderators. Six of these studies examined individual-level moderators or mediators, such as sex (Shinnar et al., 2018); action planning and positive fantasies (Gielnik et al., 2014); action-related emotions (van Gelderen et al., 2015); age-based self-image (Kautonen et al., 2015a); career motivations (Delanoë-Gueguen and Liñán, 2018); or proactive personality (Neneh, 2019). The last two studies examined how context moderates the relationship between intentions and behavior, as we do in our study. Kibler et al. (2014) examined how the self-perceived regional social legitimacy of entrepreneurship moderates the relationship. In addition to studying how age and gender moderate the relationship between intentions and entrepreneurial behavior, Shirokova et al. (2015) examined the following moderators: family business background, university support for student entrepreneurship, and self-perceived societal uncertainly avoidance.The remaining studies tested the effect of moderators.

        <p>In terms of dependent variables capturing entrepreneurial behavior, these studies varied greatly. Several relied on the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED) for identifying the behaviors related to nascent entrepreneurship (e.g., informal contacts with potential customers or working on a business plan). Others asked a single question related to the extent of engagement in business startup (Delanoë-Gueguen and Linan, 2018;Joensuu-Salu et al., 2015); the commitment in terms of effort, time, and money spent (Kautonen et al., 2015a(Kautonen et al., , 2015b;;Kibler et al., 2014;van Gelderen et al., 2015); the level of action ranging from taking no action to completing the startup of a business (Kautonen et al., 2013;Shinnar et al., 2018); and whether or not a business had been started (Gielnik et al., 2014;Goethner et al., 2012).In terms of dependent variables capturing entrepreneurial behavior, these studies varied greatly.

        <p>This detailed literature review helped us to position our contribution vis-à-vis the cutting edge of literature in the field. In particular, this paper differentiates itself for the following reasons. First, the dominant theory applied in the context of entrepreneurial behavior and intentions is exclusively TPB. We show why and how SCCT is a feasible alternative, allowing us to view new venture creation from a career perspective and to link it to the wider body of career literature, as has been called for in this literature (e.g., Burton et al., 2016).This detailed literature review helped us to position our contribution vis-à-vis the cutting edge of literature in the field.

        <p>Second, we provide a consistent and parsimonious theoretical framework for identifying relevant moderators, going beyond Kautonen et al. (2013) who focused only on perceived behavior control, and Kibler et al. (2015) and Shirokova et al. (2015), who either focused on specific contextual variables or relied on prior empirical findings to identify the boundary conditions. Third, as we were interested in entrepreneurship as a career choice, we examined actual venture creation as a dependent variable. Not until the business has been created can the actual career choice be considered made. Previous research has focused on initial engagement in (nascent) entrepreneurship rather than actual business startup (Kibler et al., 2015;Shirokova et al., 2015). Finally, we relied on longitudinal data on a sample of individuals who were about to make an important career choice, and then measured the outcome after that choice, as with cross-sectional data it is likely that the behavior itself influences intention strength (see e.g., Delmar and Wiklund, 2008). The following sections develop and show the testing of our sociocognitive model of entrepreneurial career choice.Second, we provide a consistent and parsimonious theoretical framework for identifying relevant moderators, going beyond Kautonen et al.

        <p>To develop our theory, we drew from career literature and incorporated grounded ideas from entrepreneurship theory and practice to propose a model for examining how entrepreneurial intentions and contextual variables influence new venture creation. Social cognitive career theory (SCCT, see Lent and Brown, 2013;Lent et al., 1994Lent et al., , 2000) ) builds on Bandura's social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986) to address how the social context in which an individual is nested complements the individual's intention to engage in a given career, affecting career transitions (Lent and Brown, 2013). SCCT is one of the most accepted and validated models that explain the process by which individuals form career interests and make related career choices. In particular, in SCCT, contextual influences moderate the relationship between intention and career behavior, namely the process by which individuals form and implement career choices by reinforcing the relationship under favorable environmental conditions and by weakening it under less favorable ones (Lent et al., 2000). A career approach, therefore, could help clarify how individuals' entrepreneurial intention is translated into an entrepreneurial career choice by the creation of a new venture.To develop our theory, we drew from career literature and incorporated grounded ideas from entrepreneurship theory and practice to propose a model for examining how entrepreneurial intentions and contextual variables influence new venture creation.

        <p>The effect of contextual influences often depends on how individuals assess and respond because any opportunity, resource, or difficulty faced is affected by individual interpretation (Astin, 1984;Lent et al., 2000;Vondracek et al., 1986). We are more likely to translate our interests into goals and act upon them if we perceive the environment supports us (Lent et al., 2000). For example, research shows how the support of fathers influences the educational plans and career expectations of high school girls (McWhirter et al., 1998), and faculty support and encouragement among engineering students correlates with their academic performance (Hackett et al., 1992) as well as persistence (Schaefers et al., 1997). Conversely, we are less likely to engage in career paths if we perceive that our efforts in those directions are impeded by contextual factors. For example, workplace discrimination has been used to explain difficulties related to the career development of women (Richie et al., 1997;Swanson et al., 1996) and racial-ethnic minority group members (Swanson et al., 1996).The effect of contextual influences often depends on how individuals assess and respond because any opportunity, resource, or difficulty faced is affected by individual interpretation (Astin, 1984;Lent et al., 2000;Vondracek et al., 1986).

For example, workplace discrimination has been used to explain difficulties related to the career development of women (Richie et al., 1997;Swanson et al., 1996) and racial-ethnic minority group members (Swanson et al., 1996).</p>
        <p>SCCT therefore deviates from intentional theories typically applied in entrepreneurship, such as the entrepreneurial events model and the theory of planned behavior (see Schlaegel and Koenig, 2014 for a review). Both theories are purely psychological and place intentions at center stage. Although we agree that entrepreneurial intentions are the starting point in the journey of new venture creation, studies have shown that intentions alone are not sufficient (Kautonen et al., 2015a;Kibler et al., 2014;Shirokova et al., 2015;van Gelderen et al., 2015) and other factors affect the extent to which entrepreneurial intentions lead to new venture creation.SCCT therefore deviates from intentional theories typically applied in entrepreneurship, such as the entrepreneurial events model and the theory of planned behavior (see Schlaegel and Koenig, 2014 for a review).

        <p>As with intention theories, SCCT recognizes the direct path between career interests (intentions) and subsequent career choices. At the same time, however, it emphasizes that contextual influences affect how the process unfolds and how individuals' interests are translated into actual choices. As such, individuals are influenced in their choices by perceived and objective characteristics of the context, and several proximal, or less proximal, facets influence the relationship between intentions and career-related choices. In particular, Lent et al. (1994) suggested that the environment might be represented as a series of concentric circles that surrounds individuals. The person can be seen as nested in the inner circle surrounded by their immediate social contacts (i.e., family, friends, and mentors), which is in turn encircled by the larger societal context (e.g., organization and macroeconomic conditions).As with intention theories, SCCT recognizes the direct path between career interests (intentions) and subsequent career choices.

        <p>According to SCCT, the process by which individuals form career interest and then implement related career choices is affected by environmental characteristics (Lent et al., 2000). In particular, the inner circle, which is represented by individuals' relevant others (i.e., family, peers, mentors), invariably influences their career choices.According to SCCT, the process by which individuals form career interest and then implement related career choices is affected by environmental characteristics (Lent et al., 2000).

        <p>For graduates who are making career-related decisions and are at the brink of entering the labor market for the first time, the behaviors and opinions of relevant others might be critical. They have very limited prior personal experience on which to base their career choices and turn to other sources for inspiration. The decision to start a new venture is risky and surrounded by uncertainty. In conditions of uncertainty, individuals typically experience anxiety and fear, which tend to block engagement in action and lead to procrastination and inaction (e.g., Paulus, 2007). Moreover, entrepreneurial behavior is complex and it is difficult to know what actions to perform, as well as the likely outcomes of different actions. In the process of starting a new venture, individuals face unique challenges related to acquiring the human, financial, and physical resources needed (Bolzani et al., 2019;Sorenson and Audia, 2000).For graduates who are making career-related decisions and are at the brink of entering the labor market for the first time, the behaviors and opinions of relevant others might be critical.

        <p>Relevant others (i.e., family, peers, and mentors) may serve as a "filter that distills perception of structural barriers" (Lent et al., 2000, p. 45). People tend to observe, be inspired by, and mimic those whom they admire and respect. Such social modeling involves not only understanding of appropriate courses of action, but also the motivation to engage in that behavior and confidence in one own's ability to perform the actions required for the desired outcomes successfully. Thus, relevant others provide access to valuable information (Kacperczyk, 2013), help build relevant knowledge (Baron and Henry, 2010) and provide critical resources (Brush et al., 2001;Hansen, 1995) that may mitigate perceptions of fear, uncertainty, and barriers constraining the career choice of individuals (Lent et al., 2000).Relevant others (i.e., family, peers, and mentors) may serve as a "filter that distills perception of structural barriers" (Lent et al., 2000, p. 45).

        <p>As noted, family, peers, and mentors exert particularly strong influence in the career process. Family represents the earliest and most immediate relational set in which graduates are embedded and its influences on entrepreneurship have been examined comprehensively in entrepreneurship literature, showing the importance of family as a source of early-stage funding (Bygrave et al., 2003;Steier, 2003), information, contacts (Steier, 2007(Steier, , 2009)), and moral support (Renzulli et al., 2000). In the specific context of student entrepreneurship, a recent study of Edelman et al. (2016) showed how family plays a critical role for graduates who decide to enter entrepreneurship, providing instrumental support in terms of social and financial capital and social relationships. In particular, family social capital positively affects the scope of start-up activities, while family financial capital is negatively associated with startup activities (Edelman et al., 2016). Also, by being aware of and observing the entrepreneurial activities of student peers, university graduates can understand what is required to operate a business, find motivation for engaging in entrepreneurship, and increase their confidence in taking another step forward.As noted, family, peers, and mentors exert particularly strong influence in the career process.

        <p>Several studies (e.g., Kacperczyk, 2013;Lazear, 2004;Nanda and Sørensen, 2010;Sørensen, 2007) showed that individuals in the workplace engage in social interactions that facilitate information exchange, knowledge acquisition, and the development of individuals' attitudes and values toward entrepreneurship. In particular, Bercovitz and Feldman (2008) provided evidence that individuals, in the workplace, are more likely to engage in entrepreneurial activities if their local peers are actively involved in entrepreneurship. Thus, having peers with prior entrepreneurial experiences increase the likelihood of becoming entrepreneurs (Bercovitz and Feldman, 2008;Kacperczyk, 2013;Nanda and Sørensen, 2010). University peers are students' workplace relational set and represent a second relevant source of direct social influence. Being connected with individuals at university who have already managed the entrepreneurial process reduces uncertainty about entrepreneurship for those students.Several studies (e.g., Kacperczyk, 2013;Lazear, 2004;Nanda and Sørensen, 2010;Sørensen, 2007) showed that individuals in the workplace engage in social interactions that facilitate information exchange, knowledge acquisition, and the development of individuals' attitudes and values toward entrepreneurship.

        <p>They serve as role models and provide information, access to networks, and practical skills (Hayter et al., 2017). In the case of graduate students, being surrounded by professors engaged in entrepreneurship might support the translation of entrepreneurial intentions into the creation of a new venture. In an organization, a mentor is defined as a senior member who provides support, advice, and feedback to a less experienced member for their career and personal development (Hunt and Michael, 1983;Kram, 1985;Noe et al., 2002). Mentors share valuable knowledge and experience, and individuals exposed to mentoring engage in vicarious learning: they observe actions, retain information, assimilate ideas, and create new knowledge (Bandura, 1977;Holcomb et al., 2009;Kram, 1996;Kolb and Kolb, 2005;Lanaku and Scandura, 2002).They serve as role models and provide information, access to networks, and practical skills (Hayter et al., 2017).

        <p>In the last decades, universities have changed their strategic behavior, becoming a space for potential opportunities and a constant source of innovation (Etzkowitz et al., 2000). They are playing an active role in the promotion and support of the entrepreneurial activities of their community and in particular of those of their students (Astebro et al., 2012). They have become a source of new entrepreneurs, not only among academics but also among students, creating new generations of entrepreneurs (Torrans et al., 2013).In the last decades, universities have changed their strategic behavior, becoming a space for potential opportunities and a constant source of innovation (Etzkowitz et al., 2000).

        <p>To do so, universities started putting in place different initiatives. First of all, in the past decade, they have increased dramatically the number of entrepreneurship-related courses (European Commission, 2012;Eesley et al., 2016;Hoppe, 2015). These courses offer specific entrepreneurship knowledge and skills for starting a new venture or acting more entrepreneurially, and support the message that entrepreneurship is both socially accepted and represents an alternative career path to employment (Walter et al., 2013). A second critical initiative is the development by universities of programs supporting entrepreneurship that encourage students to engage in the entrepreneurial process. These programs include activities such as business plan competitions, incubators, accelerators, or mentoring programs designed to support the development of students' entrepreneurial ideas at different stages (Nielsen and Lassen, 2012;Shirokova et al., 2015). They provide the opportunity to experience entrepreneurship, test prototypes, and develop networks and relevant ties that may provide access to critical resources necessary for the creation of a new venture. For example, students might get in touch with venture capitalists, successful entrepreneurs, and experienced mentors, to facilitate entrepreneurial opportunity exploitation. Finally, the strategic role of the technology transfer office (TTO) has changed over the years. In the early 80s, it was created to develop competence and resources to support patenting and technology transfer activities among academics (Siegel et al., 2007), and to act as a hub between academia and business. To date, as universities have focused more on entrepreneurship, TTOs have started developing more entrepreneurial competencies in order to support the new venture creation process and the diffusion of an entrepreneurial culture among academics and students (Matt and Schaffer, 2018).To do so, universities started putting in place different initiatives.

        <p>In the process of making career choices, individuals are influenced not only by their proximal circles (i.e., relevant others and organizational influences), but they are also affected by the objective and perceived larger environment. In particular, Lent et al. (2000) argued that in the process of translating career intentions into choices, individuals may choose to avoid the path chosen because they perceive insurmountable barriers to entering or advancing in their career. Moreover, barriers are domain and context specific, and they prevent a course of action but not all the alternatives (Lent et al., 2000).In the process of making career choices, individuals are influenced not only by their proximal circles (i.e., relevant others and organizational influences), but they are also affected by the objective and perceived larger environment.

        <p>Research on the regional dimension of entrepreneurship has identified and assessed the importance of structural and demographic characteristics (Armington and Acs, 2002;Reynolds et al., 1994), as well as cultural (e.g., Shinnar et al., 2012) and institutional ones (Engle et al., 2011). In particular, supportive environmental influences, such as regional economic prosperity, provide the enabling conditions for the creation of a new venture: the affluence of a region affects the ease at which people can enact entrepreneurial careers (Audretsch and Keilbach, 2004;Bergmann et al., 2016;Reynolds et al., 2004). Therefore, economic prosperity is expected to affect entrepreneurship positively, being that a wealthy context stimulates consumption and investments, which in turn lead to the creation of more entrepreneurial opportunities (Audretsch and Keilbach, 2004). Thus, individuals in wealthy contexts may perceive the availability of more entrepreneurial opportunities, which may increase their willingness to create a new venture (Bosma and Schutjens, 2011). In addition, studies on science-based entrepreneurship have shown that regional economic prosperity is positively related to the quantity and quality of academic spin-offs in the region (Audretsh and Lehmann, 2005;Casper, 2013). However, in a recent study on student entrepreneurs, Bergmann et al.Research on the regional dimension of entrepreneurship has identified and assessed the importance of structural and demographic characteristics (Armington and Acs, 2002;Reynolds et al., 1994), as well as cultural (e.g., Shinnar et al., 2012) and institutional ones (Engle et al., 2011).

        <p>(2016) provided evidence that regional economic prosperity may not increase students' propensity to enter entrepreneurship. In particular, regional prosperity does not affect venture creation per se, but strongly predicts venture survival and growth. In a career-choice context like ours, this suggests a competition between responding to a vibrant job market, rich with opportunities and eager to recruit new graduates, and the possibility of pursuing one's own venture by leveraging the favorable characteristics of the regional economic environment.(2016) provided evidence that regional economic prosperity may not increase students' propensity to enter entrepreneurship.

        <p>Becoming an entrepreneur is one of the most complex, risky and unstructured choice that an individual can make (Campbell, 1992). In a wealthy context characterized by an abundance of job opportunities, the opportunity costs of entrepreneurship might also increase (Bosma and Schutjens, 2011), particularly for graduates entering the job market for the first time. It then follows that environmental influences, proxied by the economic conditions of a region, might have different and contrasting effects on the relationship between entrepreneurial intentions and new venture creation depending on which type of individuals we are referring to. For instance, a wealthy and developed regional context may facilitate academics to act upon their intentions and establish a spin-off (Aldridge and Audretsch, 2011), but it may hinder students' intentions to create a new venture because they might be attracted by other career opportunities offered by the context.Becoming an entrepreneur is one of the most complex, risky and unstructured choice that an individual can make (Campbell, 1992).

        <p>During Round 2 of data collection, to capture graduates' choice of becoming entrepreneurs, we asked, "Did you start a new venture over the past year?" We coded the variable equal to 1 if the student started a new venture during the year following graduation and 0 otherwise. As of December 2015, within one year from their graduation, 425 students reported having started a new venture (about 2% of the respondents). We used the creation of a new venture as a proxy for engaging in an entrepreneurial career. In some countries, it may be possible to set up a venture with little effort for reasons other than pursuing an entrepreneurship career, such as, for example, tax arbitrage. In Italy, according to many international observatories (e.g., World Bank, 2018), starting a new venture is associated with extensive efforts, bureaucracy and costs, and only those who are seriously motivated to pursue an entrepreneurship career would go through the trouble of starting a new venture5 .During Round 2 of data collection, to capture graduates' choice of becoming entrepreneurs, we asked, "Did you start a new venture over the past year?"

        <p>During Round 1, students were administered the Liñán and Chen (2009) scale, which consisted of the following 6 items assessed on a 7-point Likert scale: "I am ready to do anything to be an entrepreneur"; "My professional goal is to become an entrepreneur"; "I will make every effort to start and run my own venture"; "I am determined to create a venture in the future"; "I have very serious thoughts of starting a venture"; and "I have a strong intention to start a venture someday." Based on the collected responses, the Cronbach's Alpha was equal to 0.95, giving us confidence about the reliability of our measure.During Round 1, students were administered the Liñán and Chen (2009) scale, which consisted of the following 6 items assessed on a 7-point Likert scale: "I am ready to do anything to be an entrepreneur"; "My professional goal is to become an entrepreneur"; "I will make every effort to start and run my own venture"; "I am determined to create a venture in the future"; "I have very serious thoughts of starting a venture"; and "I have a strong intention to start a venture someday."

        <p>The variables characterizing the social context were analyzed through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The aim was to consider the inter-item differences within homogeneous classes to obtain higher-level factors. Following our conceptual framework, we distinguished three main components representing the three moderators: (1) relevant others' influences, (2) organizational influences, and (3) environmental influences. For any given component, we retained the factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 (Kaiser, 1958).The variables characterizing the social context were analyzed through Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

        <p>The first component, relevant others' influences, encompassed three items: entrepreneurial parents, entrepreneurial mentors, and entrepreneurial peers. Consistent with social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986), we operationalized these variables as the extent to which each of these groups of people engaged in the behavior at hand (entrepreneurship) and, therefore, to the extent to which they can serve as sources of social modeling. The item entrepreneurial parents accounted for the most recent professional positions of both parents.The first component, relevant others' influences, encompassed three items: entrepreneurial parents, entrepreneurial mentors, and entrepreneurial peers.

        <p>The item entrepreneurial mentor assessed the relationship between a student and an entrepreneurial mentor. To graduate, all Italian seniors must write a thesis under the supervision of a faculty member who can have a profound influence on the student and represents the most central mentor in their career. AlmaLaurea recorded the first and last name of the supervisor, as well as their university and department's affiliation. We matched the names and departmental affiliations of the academics in the TASTE database with the contact details of the students' thesis mentors. Out of 14,000 academic mentors, almost 6% of were currently involved in entrepreneurial activities. This figure is consistent with the percentage of academic entrepreneurs in Italy, which is equal to about 4% of the population of 55,000 academics employed in the Italian university system between 2000 and 2014 (reference withheld). In our case, we aimed to assess the relationship between students and their academic supervisor and/or co-supervisor who are entrepreneurs (i.e., founder of an academic spin-off).The item entrepreneurial mentor assessed the relationship between a student and an entrepreneurial mentor.

        <p>In particular, first we created an index that captured whether the students' thesis supervisor or co-supervisor or both were entrepreneurs; the values ranged between 0 and 2. Second, we weighted this index for the duration of the thesis (expressed in months). Because the maximum thesis duration is 12 months, the variable entrepreneurial mentor varied from 0 to 24 (the latter captured the case in which both mentors are entrepreneurs and the thesis lasted 12 months).In particular, first we created an index that captured whether the students' thesis supervisor or co-supervisor or both were entrepreneurs; the values ranged between 0 and 2.

        <p>The item entrepreneurial peers captured the extent to which student peers were engaged in entrepreneurial activities. We focused on the peers closest to a student, those the student would most likely talk to, learn from, and imitate. Specifically, we examined whether students graduating in the same year from the same program had also started a venture during the program. The variable was a ratio between the number of peer entrepreneurs and the total number of students in the class.

        <p>The second component was organizational influences. At the university level, consistent with previous research (e.g., Fini et al., 2012), we accounted for the role played by some university infrastructures and facilities created to support students' entrepreneurial activities. In particular, as of 2014, the component included: a dummy variable to account for the presence (=1) or absence (=0) of a TTO; a dummy to capture the presence (=1) or absence offers training courses on a yearly basis. The rationale for including this variable was that the higher the number of staff trained by Netval, the greater the university's effort in supporting entrepreneurial activities.The second component was organizational influences.

        <p>The last component was environmental influences and it considered, as of 2014, a set of indicators of the economic development of the region in which universities operate. The information was retrieved using the Eurostat regional database at NUTS 2 level. As the first item, we used the log of the regional GDP, a measure that has been frequently used in studies on regional entrepreneurship to capture regional economic prosperity (Bosma and Sternberg, 2014). The second item was focused on regional job dynamics (e.g., Kibler et al., 2014), with the employment variable calculated as the ratio between the number of employed individuals aged between 20 and 64 and the total population of the same age group. The third item accounted for the presence of innovative startups in the region, calculated as the cumulative number of innovative ventures established as of 2014 in that region. According to the Italian Start-Up Act (www.startup.registroimprese.it), innovative startups are newly established firms satisfying at least one of the following criteria: investing at least 15% of their expenses in R&amp;D; having at least 1/3 of the total workforce enrolled in a PhD program, holding a PhD, or working as researchers; having at least 2/3 of the total workforce holding a master's degree; and owning or licensing a patent or software.The last component was environmental influences and it considered, as of 2014, a set of indicators of the economic development of the region in which universities operate.

Previous work experience may also affect individuals' entry into entrepreneurship (Kolvereid and Moen, 1997) and we set a dummy, work experience, equal to 1 if respondents indicated having prior work experience and 0 otherwise.

By contrast, it was negative and statistically significant (Z-score&lt;-1.96) for environmental influences in more than 60% of the cases. These results further strengthen our primary findings.</p>

        <p>First, even if the 37% response rate in Round 2 was similar to or better than response rates in other entrepreneurship studies (e.g., Kautonen et al., 2015;van Gelderen et al., 2015), some attrition may have been present, biasing our results. We therefore ran simple mean comparisons between the first and second survey waves; the results showed some statistically significant differences between means but negligible effect sizes.First, even if the 37% response rate in Round 2 was similar to or better than response rates in other entrepreneurship studies (e.g., Kautonen et al., 2015;van Gelderen et al., 2015), some attrition may have been present, biasing our results.

        <p>Second and related, because differences might be due not only to the large sample size, we then used a two-step Heckman procedure (Certo et al., 2016;Heckman, 1976) to correct for non-response bias. In the first step, we employed a probit specification to estimate the likelihood that a student would answer in Round 2, calculating the corresponding inverse Mills ratio to be included in the second stage outcome equations (i.e., new venture creation models).Second and related, because differences might be due not only to the large sample size, we then used a two-step Heckman procedure (Certo et al., 2016;Heckman, 1976) to correct for non-response bias.

        <p>We used the level of individuals' computer web skills as an exclusionary restriction (i.e., a variable that predicts the probability of answering the Round 2 questionnaire without affecting the probability of starting a new venture). We assumed those who, in Round 1, reported having higher computer and web skills were those who would most likely answer Round 2; they would more likely be online, checking their emails more often, thus increasing their likelihood of answering the second wave of the survey. We then re-estimated the logit model to predict new venture creation, including the inverse Mills ratio among the covariates, bootstrapping the standard errors 1,000 times. The results provided strong support for our primary findings and are available upon request.We used the level of individuals' computer web skills as an exclusionary restriction (i.e., a variable that predicts the probability of answering the Round 2 questionnaire without affecting the probability of starting a new venture).

        <p>Third, in the main analysis, we computed the predictive margins of entrepreneurial intention on firm creation by keeping all co-varieties at their means (both continues and categorical ones). In order to profile specific groups of graduates, we estimated the predictive margins at representative values of the covariates. In particular, we focused on the dummy variable gender (0 for female, 1 for male), and on the categorical variables field, which took the value of 1 for STEMM disciplines, the value of 2 for social science disciplines, and the value of 3 for humanities. As the percentage of graduate in humanities represented only 9% of graduates, we focused on STEMM and social science only. Thus, we predicted new venture creation at specific values of gender and field, keeping all the other covariates at their means.Third, in the main analysis, we computed the predictive margins of entrepreneurial intention on firm creation by keeping all co-varieties at their means (both continues and categorical ones).

        <p>suggested that for a high level of intention (i.e., intention=7), the female in STEMM group (combination a) was more likely to create a new venture compared to other groups (combinations b, c and d). These results were corroborated by the moderation analysis; our results suggested that for a high level of intentions, in presence of supportive relevant others, supportive organizational influences, and non-supportive environmental influences (i.e., wealthy context), female in STEMM was more likely to start a new venture compared to the three other groups.suggested that for a high level of intention (i.e., intention=7), the female in STEMM group (combination a) was more likely to create a new venture compared to other groups (combinations b, c and d).

        <p>Fourth, to control for the extent to which the three selected moderations may have affected both entrepreneurial intention and behavior at the same time, we specified a generalized structural moderated-mediation model (Preacher et al., 2007) in which the three boundary conditions simultaneously predicted entrepreneurial intention and moderated the relationship between entrepreneurial intention and new venture creation. The conditional indirect effects of the three moderators on new venture creation mediated by intentions, albeit significant, were virtually equal to zero. By contrast, the direct effect of intentions on new venture creation was equal to 0.32 (p &lt; 0.001); going up to 0.55 (p &lt; 0.001) when relevant others' and organizational influences were high (1 SD above the mean) and environmental influences were low (1 SD below the mean); going down to 0.08 (p &gt; 0.1) when relevant others' and organizational influences were low (1 SD below the mean) and environmental influences were high (1 SD above the mean). Standard errors were bootstrapped 1,000 times.Fourth, to control for the extent to which the three selected moderations may have affected both entrepreneurial intention and behavior at the same time, we specified a generalized structural moderated-mediation model (Preacher et al., 2007) in which the three boundary conditions simultaneously predicted entrepreneurial intention and moderated the relationship between entrepreneurial intention and new venture creation.

        <p>Finally, in order to account for the imbalance of the dependent variable (only 2% of entrepreneurs), we followed King and Zeng's (2000) estimation method for reducing smallsample bias in maximum likelihood estimations. Results were confirmed. Also, we tested our specification on a subsample of students who had stronger intentions to become entrepreneurs (i.e., intentions equal to 1 SD or more above the mean). Again, results were robust.Finally, in order to account for the imbalance of the dependent variable (only 2% of entrepreneurs), we followed King and Zeng's (2000) estimation method for reducing smallsample bias in maximum likelihood estimations.

        <p>This study contributes to understanding the relationship between entrepreneurial intentions and new venture creation. Despite the growing interest among scholars in investigating the conditions in which intentions lead to entrepreneurial behavior, how contextual influences affect this relationship is still unclear. Of over 20,000 university graduates, only 2% reported starting a new venture one year after graduation. In this study, we showed that environmental influences should be taken into account in order to understand better why some individuals but not others finally decide to start a new venture.This study contributes to understanding the relationship between entrepreneurial intentions and new venture creation.

        <p>Our first main finding concerns the role of relevant others. We provide evidence that individuals surrounded by supportive relevant others are more likely to enact their entrepreneurial intentions by establishing a new venture. Graduates' proximal context; characterized by family, university peers, and mentors; serves as a way to overcome external barriers, providing the cognitive resources needed to cope with such barriers. By showing how access to information, resources, and knowledge from influential individuals may be conducive to an entrepreneurial career, these results further corroborate the importance of social context in fostering entrepreneurship (Aldrich and Ruef, 2006;Audia and Rider, 2006;Dahl and Sorenson, 2009;Fisher and Stafford, 1999;Sørensen, 2007;Tinsley and Faunce, 1980).Our first main finding concerns the role of relevant others.

        <p>As for organizational influences, our results suggest that universities, by facilitating the exchange of information and acquisition of knowledge, support graduates in the process of new venture creation. Our results show that graduates who have high entrepreneurial intention and are exposed to high organizational support toward entrepreneurship are more likely to create a new venture compared to those exposed to low organizational support. Moreover, we observe that for low level of organizational support toward entrepreneurship, intention never translate into new venture creation. Therefore, university's support is critical for graduates making career choices, and in particular for those who have the intention to pursue an entrepreneurial career.As for organizational influences, our results suggest that universities, by facilitating the exchange of information and acquisition of knowledge, support graduates in the process of new venture creation.

        <p>Finally, although research on entrepreneurship shows how supportive environmental influences are conducive to entrepreneurship in general, it provides little insight into the effect on graduates' entrepreneurial choice. In particular, supportive environmental influences mean the presence of alternative job opportunities, which make, ceteris paribus, graduates with high entrepreneurial intention less likely to start a new venture. Moreover, results show that graduates exposed to a regional context, characterized by a high GDP and high employment and innovative start-ups rates, never translate their intention into venture creation. They are attracted by other careers, postponing or abandoning their intentions of entering entrepreneurship. The labor market has changed over the years and is mainly characterized by flexible employment (Baron, 2012). Thus, organizations are becoming smart and flexible; they are looking for individuals who might fit these characteristics. Hence, graduates exhibiting high entrepreneurial intentions might be attracted to and fit well into these organizations because they represent valuable alternative career options.Finally, although research on entrepreneurship shows how supportive environmental influences are conducive to entrepreneurship in general, it provides little insight into the effect on graduates' entrepreneurial choice.

        <p>In addition, our study shows that there is a certain variance between different groups of graduates. In particular, for high level of intentions, in presence of supportive relevant others and supportive organizational influences, the female in STEMM group is more likely to start a new venture compared to female in social science and to male enrolled either in STEMM or social science groups.In addition, our study shows that there is a certain variance between different groups of graduates.

        <p>These results suggest several implications for theory. First, they confirm that distinguishing two complementary levels of analysis is relevant to explicating how individuals translate their entrepreneurial intentions into venture creation. According to SCCT (Lent et al., 2000), the first one focuses on the cognitive-person variables that lead individuals to exercise personal agency in the career development process. The second one concerns the paths through which several additional factors (i.e., contextual influences) affect career choice behavior of individuals. In the process of creating a new venture (i.e., starting an entrepreneurial career), the formulation of entrepreneurial intention alone is not sufficient for individuals to act (e.g., van Gelderen et al., 2015). Moreover, entrepreneurship is under limited volitional control and several external factors influence an individual's decision to act upon intentions (Ajzen, 1991;Wiklund and Shepherd, 2003). Once individuals form entrepreneurial intentions, contextual influences might support or inhibit their decisions to create a new venture. In order to understand why some individuals enact their career interests in entrepreneurship while others don't, therefore, research must fully investigate the different elements that affect the process of translating intentions into new venture creation.These results suggest several implications for theory.

        <p>A second theoretical contribution is the use of social cognitive career theory (SCCT) to predict new venture creation. We extend the use of SCCT to entrepreneurship, with a specific focus on the context and the concepts of proximal and distal factors. With our study, we are able to distinguish between contextual support and barriers, and we provide evidence of the positive effect of proximal environmental influences on individuals' career decisions to start up a new venture. Relevant others and university influences, which represent the graduates' immediate environment, support graduates with high entrepreneurial intentions by providing economic and non-economic resources that are essential in the start-up phase of a venture. On the other hand, the munificence of the economic context that surrounds the graduates might exert a different effect than the one predicted by regional innovation systems research.A second theoretical contribution is the use of social cognitive career theory (SCCT) to predict new venture creation.

        <p>The results of this research suggest that entrepreneurial entry might be considered one of the many career options that individuals may decide to pursue in their life. To understand why some pursue an entrepreneurial career, we show that it is important to conceptualize entrepreneurship from a career perspective and examine the conditions under which it unfolds (i.e., proximal and organizations influences, economic conditions). In particular, we may consider entrepreneurship as a bridge to other career opportunities (Earle and Sakova, 2000).The results of this research suggest that entrepreneurial entry might be considered one of the many career options that individuals may decide to pursue in their life.

        <p>Individuals may decide to enter entrepreneurship because it is, at that time, the best available option and then they may decide to transition to other jobs because of lack of success or the attraction of other opportunities. As Burton et al. (2016) suggested, for many individuals who create new ventures, entrepreneurship should not be considered as an end state but a transitional one. In particular, young people in the process of entering in the labor market for the first time may choose to enter into entrepreneurship early but this choice may not be final, as they can transition into paid employment at some later state. And the reverse could be true as well.Individuals may decide to enter entrepreneurship because it is, at that time, the best available option and then they may decide to transition to other jobs because of lack of success or the attraction of other opportunities.

        <p>Future studies should explore how an entrepreneurial career might evolve over time and how entrepreneurial experiences affect individuals' overall career patterns.Future studies should explore how an entrepreneurial career might evolve over time and how entrepreneurial experiences affect individuals' overall career patterns.</p>
        <p>This study focuses on objective environmental influences. Further research might address how individuals perceive these influences and the extent to which perception of external characteristics varies among individuals, affecting their career choice. In particular, it would be interesting to explore how individuals perceive several barriers to career goal achievement (e.g., Luzzo 1993;Lent et al., 2000). Even if individuals possess high levels of entrepreneurial intentions, they may avoid acting on these intentions because they perceive insurmountable barriers to entry. The perception of critical barriers and the degree to which individuals have confidence in the ability to overcome these barriers may affect the process that leads from intention to the choice of becoming entrepreneur. Therefore, it may be relevant to understand how coping efficacy, which is the ability to manage and overcome complex situations (Bandura, 1997), affects the perception of external barriers. One could argue that individuals who have high levels of coping efficacy are more likely to engage in efforts to overcome difficulties that are associated with a particular goal or objective, such as starting a new venture. Individuals encounter different barriers that can prevent engagement in an entrepreneurial activity, and it would be interesting to understand how different levels of coping efficacy might affect this relation.This study focuses on objective environmental influences.

        <p>We investigate the relationship between entrepreneurial intention and the choice of an entrepreneurial career among graduates who are on the brink of entering the labor market for the first time. We provide evidence that a growing number of young men and women in the whole of Italy consider entrepreneurship to be a realistic career option. The empirical findings further suggest that the immediate context surrounding the individual and the larger context influence the process of translating intention into an entrepreneurial career.We investigate the relationship between entrepreneurial intention and the choice of an entrepreneurial career among graduates who are on the brink of entering the labor market for the first time.

        <p>Our results should be of great interest to universities and policymakers. Universities are highly institutionalized organizations and resistant to change. Over the last twenty years, they have been encouraged to foster entrepreneurial activities through the introduction of several mechanisms, such as professionalized technology transfer offices or dedicated policies supporting academic spin-offs (Grimaldi et al., 2011). Research in entrepreneurship has analyzed mechanisms to foster entrepreneurship among academics and students extensively (Aschhoff and Grimpe, 2014;Bergmann et al., 2018;Ferrante et al., 2018;Fini et al., 2016;Wright et al., 2017). However, several studies show that these supportive mechanisms are not always effective in fostering entrepreneurial intentions (von Graevenitz et al., 2010;Clarysse et al., 2011). With our study, we provide evidence that universities could be more efficient in the process of translating intentions into entrepreneurial career choices.Our results should be of great interest to universities and policymakers.

        <p>Universities need to create favorable conditions for entrepreneurial processes as a possible criterion to anticipate graduates' behaviors. Supporting interactions among graduates with entrepreneurial intentions, their peers who are engaged in entrepreneurship, and academic entrepreneurs may strengthen the venture creation process. Universities have to work more in this direction to boost their graduates' entrepreneurial intentions, especially for those who may not have a relevant and supportive proximal environment.Universities need to create favorable conditions for entrepreneurial processes as a possible criterion to anticipate graduates' behaviors.

        <p>A second relevant implication concerns the role of university professional services and dedicated infrastructures for the promotion of entrepreneurship.

        <p>In terms of direct success, our results show that dedicated infrastructures work only for graduates who have high intentions to start up a new venture. Although this might be of help in understanding the marginal success of many universities in promoting entrepreneurship, we believe that it offers several insights into the many ways through which universities might help their graduates make their career choice. As this is particularly true for women graduating in STEMM disciplines, the role of universities emerges as critical in bridging a well-documented gender opportunity gap in entrepreneurship (e.g., Blume-Kohout, 2014).In terms of direct success, our results show that dedicated infrastructures work only for graduates who have high intentions to start up a new venture.

        <p>Our data were collected in two-time intervals with one year in between. It would be useful to collect data in several waves to understand fully the length of the time span between entrepreneurial intentions and an entrepreneurial career choice, and to distinguish reasoned procrastination dedicated to proper planning from inaction.Our data were collected in two-time intervals with one year in between.

        <p>Many of our variables were operationalized as dummies. However, the corresponding effects can be expressed as a continuum. Moreover, although we relied on data mapping the environment in an objective way that might affect the entrepreneurial process, it would be relevant to account for individuals' perceptions as well. Future research could focus on a more detailed modeling of these effects, disentangling their components and their marginal contributions. Finally, although the Liñán and Chen (2009) scale has been extensively used to measure entrepreneurial intentions in the state of the art of the literature (e.g., Criaco et al., 2017;Shirokova et al., 2015) we acknowledged that it might fall short in adequately capturing time-related aspects, not precisely contextualizing the measure of intention in a specific time window.Many of our variables were operationalized as dummies.

        <p>Despite these limitations, we show that the definitive choice to start a new venture is affected by environmental characteristics, such as the most proximal and the more distal environment that surround individuals.

        <p>Relevant papers were located using Scopus. Two sets of keywords ("intention") AND ("entrepreneurial behavior*" OR "start-up" OR "action*" OR "new-venture") were searched for in titles and abstracts. This search produced 680 documents. After excluding conference papers, reviews, books, book chapters, and journal articles that did not deal with the intention-behavior link, we retained 43 articles. We read them and included 13 of them in the literature review that dealt specifically with the intention-behavior link (i.e., measuring intention and consequent behavior) and were relevant for the development of our theory.Relevant papers were located using Scopus.
