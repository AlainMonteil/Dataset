The UI benefit level depends on a displaced formal worker's average wage in the three months prior to layoff and ranges from 100% to 187% of the minimum wage. Define w the displaced formal worker's average nominal wage in the three months prior to layoff expressed in multiples of the prevailing minimum wage (mw).

        <p>Notes: The panels display the UI benefit level and the UI replacement rate in the Brazilian UI program, which is a function of a displaced formal worker's average nominal wage in the three months prior to layoff, expressed in multiples of the prevailing minimum wage. The replacement rate in this figure uses the gross wage (rather than the net wage as in Table 1), which is used to calculate the UI benefit level. .2 .3 .4 .5 .6 .7 .8 .9 Notes: The samples in Figure 2b are restricted to workers laid off in 2011 such that we observe their full UI spell in the UI data.

Panel (a) displays the average monthly expenditures in each of the 25 months around the layoff event for the treatment and control groups, separately (raw data, we only net out calendar month fixed effects). Panel (b) presents DD results (point estimates and 95% confidence intervals) restricting the treatment group to workers not yet reemployed by month 12 after layoff. Panel (c) presents DD results for the median. We cannot control for month and worker-event fixed effects in this case, so we focus on the unconditional sample. Panel (d) presents DD results restricting the treatment group to workers laid off from a firm that lost at least 30% of its workforce in the layoff year. We also restrict attention to firms (i) with at least 10 employees 12 months before layoff, (ii) that had not been downsizing in the year prior to the year of layoff, and (iii) that remained smaller in the year following layoff. Panel (e) presents DD estimates reweighing both the treatment group and the control group to match the distribution of observables (wage and SP amount at layoff, age, education, gender) in the benchmark sample described in column (2) of Table 1.

Panel (b) displays the estimated survival rates in nonemployment for laid off and fired workers. The survival rates are higher for laid off workers while they are eligible for UI, but they converge quickly after UI exhaustion, which is consistent with UI job-search disincentives.

        <p>The figure presents DD results for the change in expenditure levels around reemployment. Panel (a) uses laid-off workers who were reemployed in months 0 to 10 after layoff as our treatment group such that all reemployment events have at least two months in the post period. We use laid-off workers who remained without a job 12 months after layoff as our control group. We randomly assign a "placebo" reemployment event to these workers, respecting the distribution of reemployment events across the months 0 to 10 after layoff in the treatment group. We then keep the observations in the 5-month window centered around the (placebo) reemployment event. The control group allows us to net out overall changes in expenditures -unrelated to reemployment -in the months after layoff. We then follow a similar specification as in equation ( 1): we regress monthly expenditures on worker-event fixed effects, event time fixed effects (here we have k = -2, ..., 2 and we use k = -1 as reference month), month fixed effects, and event time fixed effects interacted with a dummy variable for being in the treatment group. We plot the estimated coefficients on these interactions (point estimates and 95% confidence intervals) in relative changes, dividing our estimates by the mean in the treatment group in the reference month. All samples are also reweighed such that they compare better to the overall sample of laid-off workers (as in the other empirical analyses; see Section II.A for more details), and we cluster standard errors by worker. Panel (b) displays results from a regression in which we only include the subset of workers reemployed in months 8-10 after layoff (when all job displacement insurance benefits have been exhausted). 4a (point estimates and 95% confidence intervals) for durables, home improvement, pharmacy expenditures, groceries and food away from home, separately. Panel (b) shows a large increase in spending at layoff and a large long-run loss for durables. However, durables are a not driving the results for total expenditures: non-durables are the main spending category in absolute terms and level changes (see text for details). Panel (c) shows that home improvement expenditures, a category for which complementarities with leisure may be important, is the only category for which estimates for the survival sample are always higher than estimates for the unconditional sample. The evidence for pharmacy expenditures in panel (d) indicates that the longterm loss can be substantial even for categories that are purchased almost exclusively in formal firms. Estimates for groceries in panel (e) are similar to the estimates for food as a whole in Figure 6e. The patterns for food away from home in panel (f) are different from those for all other categories: there is no spike in spending at layoff. However, this category is highly complementary to work. Therefore, the effect of the negative employment shock at layoff might dominate the effect of the increase in cash-on-hand. Moreover, workers could substitute food away by food at home after layoff.The figure presents DD results for the change in expenditure levels around reemployment.

        <p>The figure complements the evidence in Figure 8a by showing that expenditures are also very sensitive to the timing of paydays for formal employees in our data. We use the fact that monthly salaries must be paid before the fifth business day of each month in Brazil. Panel (a) follows a similar approach as in Figures 8a using our treatment and control groups in the months prior to (placebo) layoff (month -12 to -2). We divide each month into 4 quarter-month periods: a first time period including the days before the fifth business day of the month; two 7-day periods (the first one identified by a vertical line starts on the fifth business day); and a fourth period including all the remaining days of the month. We then average expenditures by worker-event and time period and we present the results (point estimates and 95% confidence intervals) of separate analyses for the treatment and control groups (period 3 is the reference period; outcome variables are not de-trended but the specification includes month fixed effects). Non-durable expenditures are about 17% higher in the 7 days following the fifth business day of the month compared to later in the month. Expenditure levels are already higher in the days prior to the fifth business day because many firms pay workers before the 5th business day of the month. Panel (b) uses a much larger dataset including all months in which a worker is observed formally employed in our data, in order to present results at the daily level. We include all months for which we observe 7 days before and 21 days after (and including) the fifth business day of the month (day 0). We present the results of separate event analyses for public-sector and private-sector employees because many public administrations pay their employees exactly on the fifth business day of the month. Accordingly, the decrease in expenditure levels in the 21 days following the fifth business day of the month (the last day is the reference period) is steeper for public employees: a reduction of 40% compared to 20% for private-sector employees. The increase on the fifth business day compared to earlier days is also steeper for public-sector employees. 8a but for the sample of UI exhaustees remaining without a job until the end of the analysis window. In panels (b) and (c), we focus on the 5 UI payment months -periods 1 to 20 in panel (a) -and test whether expenditure levels are systematically different in the 4 different periods -i.e., weeks -within a month. The coefficient for week 1 -the UI payment week -in panel (b) is a linear combination of the coefficients for periods 1, 5, 9, 13 and 17 in Figure 8a; the coefficient for week 2 is a linear combination of the coefficients for periods 2, 6, 10, 14, and 18 in Figure 8a; etc. Panel (c) replicates the same exercise but for spending on food away from home. Even though the estimates for food away from home are less precise, the point estimates are very similar between panels (b) and (c). They imply that spending on food away from home are about 20% higher in the week following a UI payment. 2 with respect to the target empirical moments capturing key reemployment patterns in our data.

In all four models, the consumer is never hand-to-mouth in month 0 after layoff: the consumer always saves part of the lump-sum severance pay received at layoff.

        <p>In Table 2, we estimate ω = 1 for the "benchmark" (fixed δ) model and ω = 0.5 -0.66 for the other models. This is why the level of exogenous income at layoff is much higher in panel (a) than in panels (b)-(d). Thus, for the impatient consumers, the values of ω &lt; 1 allow us to scale down the cash-on-hand in month 0. Otherwise, consumption would be much higher at layoff or would not become flat starting in month 3 after layoff. For the benchmark patient consumer, we have ω = 1 (corner solution) because the model needs omega as high as possible to get as much consumption as possible after layoff. 2 change following a 10% reduction in the value of δ (panels a and b) or ω (panels c and d). We only change one parameter value at the time; the other parameters are fixed at their estimated values in Table 2. Changing δ changes the shape of the increase in consumption in the first few months after layoff: reducing δ, thus making the consumer more impatient, increases consumption in month 0, makes the slope of the decrease in consumption afterwards steeper, and ends up reducing consumption in month 2. The higher degree of myopia also reduces search, shifting down the hazard rates. Changing ω only affects how much is consumed before the consumer becomes hand-to-mouth, what we refer to as the "height" of the increase in consumption at layoff in the paper. Consumption decreases in months 0-2 if we reduce the value of ω; it would have increased in those months if we had increased the value of ω instead. Reducing ω increases hazard rates early in the non-employment spell, but only to a small degree, which is not easily seen on the graph: income effects early in the non-employment spell are limited given the size of the increase in cash-on-hand at layoff and the coefficient of risk aversion used in the paper (γ = 2). 2 change following a 10% reduction in the value of χ (panels a and b) or λ (panels c and d).

        <p>Lowering the cost of generating additional income also reduces job-search efforts. Reducing the inverse of the elasticity of informal work λ slightly shifts down the predicted consumption levels in months 2-5 and to a lower extent afterwards, thus slightly decreasing the size of the drop in consumption at UI exhaustion. It also shifts down the predicted re-employment hazard after month 5.

In panel (a), reducing θ shifts the hazard rate down in all periods.</p>
        <p>In panel (b), a smaller share of low-cost types reduces the re-employment hazard, particularly around UI exhaustion between months 5 and 8. Panel (c) shows that the hazard rate becomes steeper with a reduction in the search cost for the lower-cost type: higher before month 6 and lower after month 7. Panel (d) shows that the hazard rate becomes higher after month 5 with a reduction in the search cost for the higher-cost type. We do not display the effect on consumption profiles because they are barely affected by these changes in reemployment probabilities. This can be seen in Figure A25, in which we show that consumption levels while non-employed are essentially the same for workers with very different reemployment probabilities: those reemployed in month 4 (most of them being of the low-cost type) and those not re-employed by month 12 (most of them being of the high-cost type). 2. We do not display the results from similar exercises for the other parameters in these models because these parameters are shared with the myopia model and so behave similarly as in Figures A14-A16. Changing β changes the shape of the increase in consumption in the first few months after layoff: reducing β, thus making the consumer more present-biased, increases consumption in month 0, makes the slope of the decrease in consumption afterwards steeper, and ends up reducing consumption in months 1 and 2. The higher degree of present-bias also reduces search, shifting down the hazard rates, particularly around UI exhaustion between months 5 and 8.

Notes: The figure displays the predicted consumption profile with the four estimated models, using the estimated parameters in Table 2, if we assume a positive initial asset level (a 0 = 2 or twice the monthly household income prior to layoff) rather than the zero initial asset assumption used for the estimations (a 0 = 0). For reference, the figure also displays the corresponding target empirical moments. The consumption profiles are unchanged compared to those in Figure 9 for the myopia and present-bias models because workers deplete their assets prior to layoff. This is not the case with forward-looking workers, which is why consumption levels remain slightly higher than in Figure 9 for the benchmark model.In panel (b), a smaller share of low-cost types reduces the re-employment hazard, particularly around UI exhaustion between months 5 and 8. Panel (c) shows that the hazard rate becomes steeper with a reduction in the search cost for the lower-cost type: higher before month 6 and lower after month 7. Panel (d) shows that the hazard rate becomes higher after month 5 with a reduction in the search cost for the higher-cost type. We do not display the effect on consumption profiles because they are barely affected by these changes in reemployment probabilities. This can be seen in Figure A25, in which we show that consumption levels while non-employed are essentially the same for workers with very different reemployment probabilities: those reemployed in month 4 (most of them being of the low-cost type) and those not re-employed by month 12 (most of them being of the high-cost type). 2. We do not display the results from similar exercises for the other parameters in these models because these parameters are shared with the myopia model and so behave similarly as in Figures A14-A16. Changing β changes the shape of the increase in consumption in the first few months after layoff: reducing β, thus making the consumer more present-biased, increases consumption in month 0, makes the slope of the decrease in consumption afterwards steeper, and ends up reducing consumption in months 1 and 2. The higher degree of present-bias also reduces search, shifting down the hazard rates, particularly around UI exhaustion between months 5 and 8. Notes: The figure displays the fit of the four models in Table A1, for which we use log utility (γ = 1), with respect to the target empirical moments capturing key consumption patterns in our data. The grey lines display the target empirical moments in each panel. The black lines display the predicted moments for the estimated models.

        <p>The receipts data contains information about the total value of the receipt, the merchant and a time stamp. The time recorded in the receipt allows us to create a weekly and monthly panel of spending used in the paper. Figure B1 shows an example of a receipt from a purchase in a São Paulo grocery shop. All receipts have a field to fill in the buyer's tax ID number (CNPJ or CPF as indicated in the figure) if provided. In business-to-business transactions, the tax ID is the CNPJ of the firm, and the receipt may be used as tax credit in the VAT system by the buying firm. In sales to final consumers, consumers' ID number (their CPF) can be indicated in this field as highlighted in Figure B1, in which case they are eligible for lottery tickets and tax rebates (see more details in Naritomi 2019).The receipts data contains information about the total value of the receipt, the merchant and a time stamp.

        <p>In order to categorize the data from receipts into different types of spending, we use the sector of activity of the establishment that issued the receipt as defined by the National Classification of Economic Activities -Classificação Nacional de Atividades Econômicas (CNAE) version 2.0. More precisely, we use the most dis-aggregated classification, which is a 7-digit sector definition that allows us to finely categorize the type of shop consumers are buying from. For instance: 47 is Retail; 472 is Retail of food, beverages, tobacco; 4722-9 is Retail of meat and fish; 4722-9/01 is Retail of meat.In order to categorize the data from receipts into different types of spending, we use the sector of activity of the establishment that issued the receipt as defined by the National Classification of Economic Activities -Classificação Nacional de Atividades Econômicas (CNAE) version 2.0.

        <p>The two main categories that we would like to analyze separately are durables and non-durables. For this categorization, we followed the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (LBS). Two research assistants worked on this categorization separately to ensure consistency using the description of the CNAE codes, and a third one reviewed the final list. For instance, we classified as durables purchases 7-digit CNAE codes that have descriptions similar to the goods described in NAICS 423 ("Durable Goods"). It includes mostly personal electronics, home appliances, furniture, vehicles and vehicle parts.The two main categories that we would like to analyze separately are durables and non-durables.

        <p>We classified as non-durables purchases all CNAE codes that are associated with goods described in NAICS 424 ("Nondurable Goods"), but we include transportation fuel (mostly gasoline or other fuel for auto-vehicles) in order to make our non-durable classification comparable to Lusardi (1996) and Ganong and Noel (2019).1 . We also created a separate category of spending from durables and non-durables: home improvement. It includes expenditures related to building materials, renovations and construction work. These are expenditures that could be considered complements to having more disposable time after layoff, and are related to construction work and purchases of tools that could be used in such activities.We classified as non-durables purchases all CNAE codes that are associated with goods described in NAICS 424 ("Nondurable Goods"), but we include transportation fuel (mostly gasoline or other fuel for auto-vehicles) in order to make our non-durable classification comparable to Lusardi (1996) and Ganong and Noel (2019).1 .

        <p>Table B1 and B2 list the CNAE codes for each category we analyze in Figure 6 and Figure A6. In total, we observe 988 CNAE codes in the data. However, the purchases are highly concentrated among fewer CNAE codes. We restrict attention to CNAE codes that together amount to 95% of the receipts in each category. Table B1 shows the main CNAE codes and their description for Durables and Non-Durables. Within non-durables, we highlight the CNAE codes in Strict nondurables and Other non-durables. CNAE codes categorized as Strict non-durables are non-durable categories that follow the definition proposed by Lusardi (1996): it excludes education related expenses (e.g., bookstores), health-related expenditures (Pharmaceutical sectors), and semi-durables (e.g., apparel, toy or pet shops, office supply shops). These categories are listed under Other non-durables in the table.Table B1 and B2 list the CNAE codes for each category we analyze in Figure 6 and Figure A6.

        <p>In order to check how our consumer spending measure compares with other data sources, we analyze the most recent household expenditure survey (POF) available at IBGE, which is 2008/2009. It collects data on income, household demographic characteristics and expenditures. The survey is representative at the state level, and we restrict attention to households in the state of São Paulo. Food expenditures are collected through diaries, and non-food expenditures are based on recall. Although there are potential concerns about data quality with this type of expenditure data -see, for instance, Lanjouw (2005) -it is a useful external data source to benchmark our data. Below, we describe several steps that were taken to harmonize the two datasets for this comparison.In order to check how our consumer spending measure compares with other data sources, we analyze the most recent household expenditure survey (POF) available at IBGE, which is 2008/2009.

        <p>Harmonizing POF and our consumer spending data Our consumer spending sample. We pooled together the App de-identified users that were found in the matched employer-employee data (RAIS). In POF, surveys are conducted at different time periods between 2008 and 2009. To make our data compatible with the sampling structure of POF surveys, we drew a random simulated survey month for each worker in 2011, which is the earliest year in our data for which we can measure consumer spending for the previous 12 months (the data start in 2010). We restricted our sample only to individuals who were working in the selected month and who were between 20 and 50 years old. After selecting the hypothetical survey month, we used a window of 12 months of consumption from our data -the survey month and 11 months before -to aggregate the total expenditure. All values are monthly averages for 12 months.Harmonizing POF and our consumer spending data Our consumer spending sample.

        <p>POF survey sample. For the sake of comparison with our consumer spending data, we restrict attention to households with formal workers from São Paulo who were between 20 and 50 years old. Importantly, we need to identify formal labor income in POF as this is the only income source we can observe in RAIS. POF does not identify formal workers directly, but it is possible to define formality as private or public jobs with income subject to compulsory contribution to social security. All expenditure and income values are monthly averages for the 12month period before (and including) the survey month.POF survey sample.

        <p>Categorization of expenditures. The POF survey covers a broader set of expenditures compared to our consumer spending data: it includes housing and a larger range of services (e.g., transportation services such as public transport or taxis; these purchases are not taxed by the state VAT). In order to compare similar categories across the two datasets, we categorized the purchases from POF according to the "Descrição do Item" (the product description) in POF's catalog of 6-digit code products. In 2008/2009, the catalog had 13,785 items. Two research assistants categorized the whole catalog separately, and a third research assistant revised the final categories to ensure consistency. Similarly to the CNAE description, the text allows us to classify purchases between categories of interest such as: durables, non-durables, and the other sub-categories described above into which we categorized the CNAE of merchant.Categorization of expenditures.

        <p>Another relevant difference between the two datasets is that total expenditures in POF are best measured at the household level, whereas our consumer spending data is reported by the individual. The POF survey has expenditure measures at the individual and household levels, but some relevant items are only measured at the household level, such as groceries or durables like home appliances. Thus, we restrict attention to household-level expenditure data in POF. Even though we cannot observe families in our data, it is possible that the expenditures we observe are not individual, but household expenditures. The NFP program creates incentives for households to provide the same ID number when making a purchase independently of the identity of the consumer: it gives participants one lottery ticket for each R$50 in total reported purchases. Indeed, in the survey we conducted in São Paulo, more than 60% of workers indicated that all their household members participated in the NFP program with the same ID number (see Appendix Table C1).Another relevant difference between the two datasets is that total expenditures in POF are best measured at the household level, whereas our consumer spending data is reported by the individual.

        <p>This section shows how the different consumption measures from the two sources of data behave relatively to formal income changes in a cross-section. Beyond potential data coverage differences, it is possible that, in our data, the consumer may not provide her ID number for all her purchases and the consumer may not be making all the households' purchases. Nonetheless, overall, the empirical regularities in the data show that the coverage of our data is relatively constant when we look at a cross-section of income levels.This section shows how the different consumption measures from the two sources of data behave relatively to formal income changes in a cross-section.

        <p>We construct three consumer spending measures to compare POF and our data: (i) Total expenditure, which is the total household expenditure observed in POF and the total expenditure observed in our data, irrespective of their categories; (ii) Comparable categories excludes from the Total expenditure in POF the categories that cannot be measured in our data (e.g., housing); (iii) Total non-durable expenditure is defined in both datasets as described in Table B1.We construct three consumer spending measures to compare POF and our data: (i) Total expenditure, which is the total household expenditure observed in POF and the total expenditure observed in our data, irrespective of their categories; (ii) Comparable categories excludes from the Total expenditure in POF the categories that cannot be measured in our data (e.g., housing); (iii) Total non-durable expenditure is defined in both datasets as described in Table B1.</p>
        <p>Figure B2 displays the same graph as in Figure 3a for each of the three measures of spending. In both datasets, we restrict attention to workers that earn at least one minimum wage, which is the relevant sample for our study.2 The y-axis displays the ratio of spending in our data to household expenditures in the survey data. We use deciles of the POF formal wage distribution to define bins, and we averaged the spending in each bin for each dataset separately using sampling weights based on a vector of covariates (quartiles of age, and dummy variables for being white, having a high school degree, and being female) such that our sample matches the POF sample on observables.Figure B2 displays the same graph as in Figure 3a for each of the three measures of spending.

        <p>Notes: The table lists the cross-walk between the main spending categories used in the paper based on the sector of activity of the shops (CNAE) that issue the receipts. There is a total of 988 7-digit CNAE codes that were classified into different consumption categories based on the description of the sector. The list displayed in the table restricts attention to the top 7-digit CNAE codes in each category in terms of number of receipts that add up to 95% of all receipts in that category. Durables: 7-digit CNAE codes with descriptions similar to the goods described in NAICS 423 of U.S. LBS. improvements/works in a home. Non-durables: CNAE codes that can be classified following U.S. BLS NAICS 424 description (including transportation fuel). Strict non-durable: are non-durable categories that follow the definition proposed by Lusardi (1996): it excludes education related expenses, health-related expenditures and semi-durables.Notes: The table lists the cross-walk between the main spending categories used in the paper based on the sector of activity of the shops (CNAE) that issue the receipts.

        <p>The figure provides evidence supporting the quality of our de-identified expenditure data. Panels (a) -(c) display the ratio of average expenditures as measured in our data and in the latest round of the Survey of Household Expenditures (POF) by wage decile for workers formally employed at the time of the interview (survey data) and on December 31st (our data) in São Paulo. Average expenditure levels are estimated for each decile and dataset separately before taking their ratio (95% confidence intervals are calculated using the delta method). In Panel (a) we include all expenditures in both datasets (including spending categories in POF that are not covered in our data). Panel (b) shows the same graph as in Figure 3a: comparable categories. Panel (c) shows the ratio for goods classified as non-durables, which is defined in both datasets as described in Table B1. In all graphs, we reweight our data to match the distribution in the survey data of demographic characteristics observed in both datasets (quartiles of age, dummy variables for being white, having a high school degree, and being female). The vertical line indicates the average wage in our analysis sample as a reference. The horizontal line indicate the average ratio across wage deciles. In the three cases, the average is within the 95% confidence interval for most estimates across wage bins.The figure provides evidence supporting the quality of our de-identified expenditure data.

        <p>Targeted population. The survey was targeted to two groups of workers: (i) UI applicants: workers who were laid off in the past 6 months from a formal job and applied for UI in the past 30 days (typically just before the interview as our interviews were conducted outside PATs); (ii) Formal employees: workers that, at the moment of the survey, were employed in the formal sector. We define "formal job" as a job in which the employer signed the worker's working card, which is mandatory and is the key paperwork to ensure that workers are protected by labor laws.Targeted population.

        <p>We worked with a team of Columbia undergraduates from many different parts of the world over a period of about six months, under the constant supervision of a PhD student in the Economics department, to create this dataset. In a first step, each undergraduate student was responsible for a set of countries (given their language proficiencies) and was instructed to find the necessary sources of information in order to document the existence and history of four sets of government-mandated programs (UI, SP, SSA, and UISA) since 1900 in each country. Effectively, given the many challenges involved, students often helped each other at this stage (they all met on a weekly basis). In a second step, another undergraduate student from the team verified the information for each country and coded it in a binary fashion, i.e., whether a significant version of each of the 4 programs existed in the country at some point for each decade since 1900. This step naturally involves some difficult decisions, so the students were instructed to justify all their decisions carefully. Using a binary classification also avoids the issue of comparing the generosity of programs along their many different policy parameters (it is much easier to go back in time to find information on the existence of a program than to find information on all its benefit schedules). In a third step, the PhD student reviewed all the data and the consistency of the coding across countries.We worked with a team of Columbia undergraduates from many different parts of the world over a period of about six months, under the constant supervision of a PhD student in the Economics department, to create this dataset.
