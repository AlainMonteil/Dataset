        <p>We demonstrate why meaningful work, i.e. job-related activities that individuals view as purposeful and worthwhile, matters to labour economists. Building on self-determination theory, which specifies the roles of autonomy, competence, and relatedness as preconditions for motivation, we are the first to explore the determinants of work meaningfulness. Specifically, using three waves of the European Working Conditions Survey, we show that autonomy, competence, and relatedness explain about 60% of the variation in work meaningfulness perceptions. Meanwhile, extrinsic factors, such as income, benefits, and performance pay, are relatively unimportant. Meaningful work also predicts absenteeism, skills training, and retirement intentions, which highlights the concept's economic significance. We provide new insights that could help organise the future of work in a meaningful and dignifying way and propose concrete avenues for future research on meaningful work in economics.We demonstrate why meaningful work, i.e. job-related activities that individuals view as purposeful and worthwhile, matters to labour economists.

        <p>The concept of meaningful work -activities that individuals view as purposeful and worthwhile -has received relatively little attention in modern economics. 1 While organisational psychologists have long examined the meaning people derive from their jobs ( Rosso et al., 2010 ), modern economists typically conceive of work as a disutility, i.e. as an unpleasant activity that must be endured as a means to earn an income and finance consumption. Nevertheless, studies relying on selfreported and experimental data have challenged the assumption that only monetary motivations matter in the labour market ( Binder, 2016;Bradler et al., 2016;Hamermesh, 2018;Hamilton, 2000;Kosfeld et al., 2017;Preston, 1989;Stern, 2004 ). In fact, one convincing piece of evidence for the intrinsic value of work is the enormous psychological cost of becoming unemployed, which by far exceeds income losses ( Clark, 2001;Kassenboehmer and Haisken-DeNew, 2009; Knabe and Rätzel, sequences of meaningful work using a cross-country nationally representative dataset of workers from 30 European countries in 2005, 2010, and 2015. Conceptually, we rely on self-determination theory ( Deci and Ryan, 1985;Ryan and Deci, 2000 ), which outlines the conditions leading to motivation and work meaningfulness. Empirically, we construct an index of meaningful work based on survey statements about perceptions of doing useful work and having feelings of "a job well done " (fulfillment) (see Appendix Table A.2 and Fig. 1 ). As such, we are the first to quantify the relative importance of job characteristics that enhance or diminish work meaningfulness, which could help inform policies and interventions to promote it. We find that autonomy, competence, and relatedness are about 4.6 times more important for meaningfulness at work than compensation, benefits, career advancement, job insecurity, and working hours. Relatedness, which reflects supportive relationships with colleagues and superiors, emerges as the most important factor for work meaningfulness. These findings highlight the greater salience of self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation for meaningfulness compared to objective working conditions and monetary rewards.The concept of meaningful work -activities that individuals view as purposeful and worthwhile -has received relatively little attention in modern economics. 1 While organisational psychologists have long examined the meaning people derive from their jobs ( Rosso et al., 2010 ), modern economists typically conceive of work as a disutility, i.e. as an unpleasant activity that must be endured as a means to earn an income and finance consumption.

        <p>Second, we show that perceptions of meaningful work have implications for labour economics because they meaningfully predict retirement intentions, absenteeism, and skills training. For example, a ten-point increase in work meaningfulness reduces absenteeism by about one third of a working day per year and raises the intended retirement age by 2.5 years, on average. These findings not only validate the usefulness of work meaningfulness in economics but also have relevant implications for employers and policy-makers. Our third contribution is that we outline the conceptual and methodological steps for a future research agenda on meaningful work in economics.Second, we show that perceptions of meaningful work have implications for labour economics because they meaningfully predict retirement intentions, absenteeism, and skills training.

        <p>While well-being is a latent construct, there are two main approaches to conceptualising and measuring it, which have their own advantages and disadvantages ( Brown et al., 2007;2012;Green, 2006;Knox et al., 2015 ). According to the objective approach, worker well-being is about having the freedoms that allow individuals to meet specific needs, such as autonomy and skills development ( Brown et al., 2007;2012;Green, 2006 ). This framework draws on Sen's (1999) capability approach, which conceptualises well-being in terms of having the capabilities to achieve "functionings ", i.e. states of being and doing that the individual values. In the objective approach, worker well-being can be evaluated based on whether the job furnishes workers with the capabilities and material security to achieve their goals and fulfill their needs ( Brown et al., 2012;Budd and Spencer, 2015;Eurofound, 2012;Green, 2006 ).While well-being is a latent construct, there are two main approaches to conceptualising and measuring it, which have their own advantages and disadvantages ( Brown et al., 2007;2012;Green, 2006;Knox et al., 2015 ).

        <p>As such, the objective approach relies on job quality measures, i.e. job characteristics and working conditions ( De Bustillo et al., 2011b;Felstead et al., 2019;Green, 2006;Howell and Kalleberg, 2019 ). For example, based on Sen's capability approach, Green (2006) defines job quality in terms of earnings, skill, effort, autonomy, security, and personal discretion. The extent to which a person's job provides these factors determines their ability to achieve well-being ( Budd and Spencer, 2015 ). To date, several multi-dimensional job quality indices have been created ( De Bustillo et al., 2011b;Eurofound, 2012;Leschke and Watt, 2014 ). Nevertheless, the main challenges of the objective approach concern the choice and measurement of the characteristics that comprise job quality ( Budd and Spencer, 2015;Clark, 2011 ). In particular, the final list of selected job quality measures may reflect data availability and researcher discretion, rather than workers' preferences. Challenges may also arise when picking what weights the job quality measures should receive to form a comprehensive multi-dimensional job quality index ( De Bustillo et al., 2011a;Leschke and Watt, 2014 ). Because it focuses on job characteristics, the objective approach has also been criticised for being job-centric and for ignoring the broader meanings that work has in people's lives ( Budd and Spencer, 2015 ).As such, the objective approach relies on job quality measures, i.e. job characteristics and working conditions ( De Bustillo et al., 2011b;Felstead et al., 2019;Green, 2006;Howell and Kalleberg, 2019 ).

        <p>In contrast, the subjective well-being approach assumes that people themselves are the best judges of their working and living environments ( Graham et al., 2018;Graham and Nikolova, 2015;MacKerron, 2012;OECD, 2013;Stone and Mackie, 2014 ). In the work domain, subjective measures of well-being include self-reported feelings and evaluations of the overall working conditions. In economics, the most common subjective well-being measure in the work domain is job satisfaction ( Clark, 2001;2005;2011;2015;Sousa-Poza and Sousa-Poza, 2000;Wanous et al., 1997 ). 2 Job satisfaction is a reflective assessment of one's overall working environment that also incorporates expectations, norms, values, alternatives, and the outcomes and rewards of work ( Angrave and Charlwood, 2015;Weiss, 2002 ). The fact that job satisfaction predicts labour market behaviours such as job quits ( Clark, 2001;Green, 2010;Lvy-Garboua et al., 2007 ) implies that this measure reflects workers' preferences ( Clark, 2015 ). Job satisfaction is also instrumentally important for productivity ( Böckerman and Ilmakunnas, 2012 ). The job satisfaction literature has examined how different working conditions and arrangements influence job satisfaction. For example, analyses of the 1997 International Social Survey Program data show that having an interesting job and good relations with management are the biggest predictors of job satisfaction ( Clark, 2005;Sousa-Poza and Sousa-Poza, 2000 ). Similarly, relying on German panel data, Cornelissen (2009) identifies relationships with colleagues and managers, job insecurity, and task diversity as the most influential satisfaction determinants. Clark (2011) proposes that job satisfaction is a comprehensive summative measure reflecting objective and subjective job quality, though this view has not remained unchallenged ( Brown et al., 2012 ). The main critique of using job satisfaction as a proxy for worker well-being is that workers may report being satisfied with jobs that are objectively bad. Specifically, individuals may adapt to low job quality and learn to be satisfied with poor working conditions ( Brown et al., 2012 ). Therefore, job satisfaction reflects both well-being at work and the norms and expectations that employees have when answering such questions, which is something that should be kept in mind when interpreting these data ( Brown et al., 2012 ). Nevertheless, subjective measures provide a valuable bottom-up perspective on workers' own understanding of well-being. Importantly, the objective and subjective approaches are not mutually exclusive and are often used in complementary ways ( Green, 2006;Green et al., 2016 ).In contrast, the subjective well-being approach assumes that people themselves are the best judges of their working and living environments ( Graham et al., 2018;Graham and Nikolova, 2015;MacKerron, 2012;OECD, 2013;Stone and Mackie, 2014 ).

        <p>In this paper, we study self-reported perceptions of work meaningfulness and as such, we draw on the subjective approach, while also recognising the critiques and insights of its objective counterpart. A key limitation of both the objective and subjective approaches to job quality is the lack of attention to work as a source of meaning.3 This general neglect of work meaningfulness is unfortunate, because it severely limits our understanding of the true spectrum of well-being measures in the work domain and the particular position of meaningful work in that spectrum. It is also surprising, given that the notion of work meaningfulness is not new in the social sciences and can be traced back at least to Karl Marx who believed that labour was inherently purposeful and a source of fulfillment, rather than just a means to satisfy material needs ( Spencer, 2009 ). 4Nevertheless, the fact that self-reported measures of job satisfaction are well-established raises the question of the value-added of research on meaningful work perceptions. Indeed, job satisfaction captures the overall subjective evaluation of the working environment. However, the concept of work meaningfulness goes above and beyond job satisfaction. For example, a person can be dissatisfied with the general working conditions, and find their daily duties stressful and unpleasant, yet deem the nature of the tasks as meaningful or impactful. Individuals working in occupations involving teaching of nursing easily fit this description. Conversely, an individual can be satisfied with the working conditions on the job but still perceive their work activities as meaningless. This may explain why, for example, many people do not quit their jobs despite finding them socially useless ( Dur and van Lent, 2019 ). Empirically, Allan et al. (2019) provide evidence that different scales of meaningful work are correlated with but distinct from job satisfaction. We find similar results with our data: the correlation between meaningful work and satisfaction with working conditions is 0.33 (see Table A .5 ).In this paper, we study self-reported perceptions of work meaningfulness and as such, we draw on the subjective approach, while also recognising the critiques and insights of its objective counterpart.

        <p>Therefore, like Steger et al. (2012) , we argue that meaningful work is a eudaimonic dimension of (perceived) worker well-being. Eudaimonia generally entails flourishing and living a life that realises one's-potential ( Deci and Ryan, 2008;Graham and Nikolova, 2015;Ryan et al., 2008 ), and contrasts with hedonic and evaluative dimensions of subjective well-being. Typically, eudaimonic subjective well-being is captured using survey questions about whether the respondent has meaning and purpose in life. For example, Graham and Nikolova (2015) find that the biggest predictor of eudaimonic well-being is belief in hard work as a means of getting ahead in life, highlighting the connection between efforts in the work domain and having a life purpose. By contrast, life satisfaction is an evaluative measure of well-being and is a reflective assessment of one's overall life circumstances. Therefore, just like life satisfaction is distinct from having meaning and purpose in life ( Graham and Nikolova, 2015 ), job satisfaction is conceptually different from work meaningfulness. Evaluative and eudaimonic measures also differ from hedonic well-being, i.e. positive and negative feelings at a particular point in time, such as stress or anger, or happiness and joy triggered by specific events ( Graham et al., 2018 ). Hedonic well-being in the workplace refers to feelings, such as stress, engagement, and enthusiasm. Table A.5 demonstrates that the correlations between meaningful work and stress, engagement, and enthusiasm range between 0.1 and 0.4, highlighting the difference between hedonic and eudaimonic subjective well-being at work.Therefore, like Steger et al.

        <p>Our understanding of meaningful work is based on selfdetermination theory ( Deci and Ryan, 1985;Ryan and Deci, 2000 ). According to this theory, satisfying three innate psychological needs -competence, autonomy and relatedness -underpins intrinsic motivation and eudaimonic well-being ( Ryan and Deci, 2000 ). Without competence, autonomy, and relatedness, individuals are unable to derive utility from meaning. This justifies the conceptual and empirical examination of work meaningfulness in the context of these three preconditions.Our understanding of meaningful work is based on selfdetermination theory ( Deci and Ryan, 1985;Ryan and Deci, 2000 ).

This justifies the conceptual and empirical examination of work meaningfulness in the context of these three preconditions.</p>
        <p>In self-determination theory, competence refers to the perceived ability to successfully overcome challenging tasks at work and contribute to a cause, which creates feelings of mastery ( Martela and Riekki, 2018;Rosso et al., 2010;Ryan and Deci, 2000 ). It entails a belief in having the right skills to make an impact. Moreover, people satisfy their need for autonomy when they perceive that they have choices and authority over what to do. Autonomy is empirically linked to meaningfulness ( Martela and Riekki, 2018;Martela et al., 2018;Ryan and Deci, 2000 ) because it allows for self-expression, control over the work content and process, and the ability to choose how and when to apply different skills and capabilities. This is in stark contrast with heteronomy , a condition whereby behaviour is regulated by forces that the worker perceives as over-imposed, as would be the case with heavy top-down management, for example. Finally, relatedness is about the inter-personal relationships at work ( Martela and Riekki, 2018;Ryan and Deci, 2000 ). Workers feel related if they experience genuine care from their bosses or colleagues, and that they care about their superiors and co-workers in return.In self-determination theory, competence refers to the perceived ability to successfully overcome challenging tasks at work and contribute to a cause, which creates feelings of mastery ( Martela and Riekki, 2018;Rosso et al., 2010;Ryan and Deci, 2000 ).

        <p>Importantly, autonomy, competence, and relatedness are not externally determined objective targets, but rather strongly depend on each individual's innate needs. This implies that there is no single policy in the workplace that employers can adopt to meet the needs of all employees. In addition to autonomy, competence, and relatedness, environmental circumstances and extrinsic rewards facilitate or forestall self-motivation. Therefore, motivation is formed through the interplay between the work environment created by the employer and the satisfaction of the person-specific needs for autonomy, relatedness and competence.Importantly, autonomy, competence, and relatedness are not externally determined objective targets, but rather strongly depend on each individual's innate needs.

        <p>According to Ryan and Deci (2000) , there is an intricate relationship between different states of motivation and meaning. First, when work completely fails to satisfy people's innate needs, they are amotivated , meaning that they are passive and unwilling to work at any level of pay. Second, when workers are in a state of controlled motivation , their needs for autonomy, relatedness, and competence are partially satisfied. However, in this state, workers can only be extrinsically motivated through monetary rewards because they do not find their tasks inherently purposeful. Finally, workers are in a state of autonomous motivation when their psychological needs are fulfilled and they feel that the purpose of their tasks matches their personal values and purpose. At that point, their tasks become meaningful. Autonomous motivation is impossible at low levels of autonomy, competence, and relatedness, because people cannot experience self-efficacy: they fail to see how their personal actions affect the outcome, which implies that their effort is meaningless. Therefore, the three basic needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness, need to be satisfied to derive meaning from work.According to Ryan and Deci (2000) , there is an intricate relationship between different states of motivation and meaning.

        <p>Extrinsic factors, such as financial incentives and rewards, may be additional preconditions to achieving work meaningfulness ( Cassar and Meier, 2018;Spencer, 2015 ). For instance, an insufficient income level limits the ability to meet basic consumption needs and thwarts people's efforts to achieve their goals and work independently ( Vohs et al., 2006 ). Financial incentives matter for intrinsic motivation and effort ( Lazear, 2018 ), and psychologists show that pecuniary aspects are more important than non-pecuniary ones to workers who have less income to begin with ( Rosso et al., 2010 ). The flipside of this argument is that jobs deprived of intrinsic rewards would only matter to workers through the monetary compensation they offer ( Cassar and Meier, 2018 ). Other extrinsic factors -hours of work, career progression possibilities, and job insecurity -also influence the ability to derive work meaningfulness (Spencer, 2015). For instance, individuals will work longer or more intensely if they feel motivated, compared to a state when they are only working to finance their consumption and leisure ( Cassar and Meier, 2018 ). Nevertheless, long working hours can lead to exhaustion and limit the ability for creative work. Finally, job insecurity can negatively affect certain health outcomes ( Caroli and Godard, 2016 ), including mental health ( Reichert and Tauchmann, 2017 ), which may leave little scope for meaningfulness.Extrinsic factors, such as financial incentives and rewards, may be additional preconditions to achieving work meaningfulness ( Cassar and Meier, 2018;Spencer, 2015 ).

        <p>The extant literature provides some intuition into how meaningful work perceptions can affect workers' choices and behaviours. First, experimental studies have documented that viewing one's work as meaningful (i.e. task meaning) increases effort and productivity ( Ariely et al., 2008;Bäker and Mechtel, 2018;Chadi et al., 2016;Chandler and Kapelner, 2013;Grant, 2008;Kosfeld et al., 2017 ) For example, Ariely et al. (2008) conducted two experiments manipulating the meaningfulness of the task (finding consecutive occurrences of the letter 's' in Experiment 1 and assembling Legos in Experiment 2) by acknowledging or destroying the final product, which revealed to participants the meaningfulness of the task. Indeed, labour supply was higher and reservation wages were lower when the experimenters signalled the meaningfulness of the task. Second, theoretical work in economics has proposed that people have an innate drive for sense-making ( Chater and Loewenstein, 2016;Karlsson et al., 2004 ). Thus, fulfilling the need for meaning is part of an individual's utility function and decision-making.The extant literature provides some intuition into how meaningful work perceptions can affect workers' choices and behaviours.

        <p>Our paper is related to but substantively different from four recent contributions. First, using pooled cross-sectional data from the International Social Survey Program (ISSP), Dur and van Lent (2019) document that about one in ten employees finds their job useless, with the share being the highest among those engaging in routine tasks as well as those in sales, finance, public relations, and marketing. The authors furnish suggestive evidence that the share of socially useless jobs may increase with the output gap, which they interpret as evidence for labour hoarding, i.e. the retention of more workers than necessary in times of economic turmoil. Dur and van Lent's (2019) study differs from ours in that it focuses on the determinants of a different concept -socially useless jobs -and utilizes a different dataset.Our paper is related to but substantively different from four recent contributions.

        <p>Several studies have relied on time use data to study meaningfulness during work episodes. For example, Kaplan and Schulhofer-Wohl (2018) rely on the American Time Use Survey and find that since the 1950s, women have switched to occupations that have provided high non-pecuniary benefits of working, including more episodes of meaningfulness. The conclusion is more nuanced for men who have shifted to occupations that generate less meaningfulness and happiness and more stress, but fewer feelings of pain and tiredness. Nevertheless, Bryce (2018) surprisingly documents that while working is in itself negatively associated negatively associated with meaning, community and social service, legal, education, and healthcare occupations are considered the most meaningful (relative to transportation jobs) in the American Time Use Survey. The unexpected negative association between working and meaningfulness is likely due to the fact that time use surveys capture the hedonic and not eudaimonic work aspects.Several studies have relied on time use data to study meaningfulness during work episodes.

        <p>Using German time use data, Wolf et al. (2019) document that along with childcare and exercising, working is among the most meaningful activities in people's daily lives, which contrasts with the findings of Bryce (2018) . Wolf et al. (2019) find that individuals reporting no meaning at all and those reporting very high meaning are more likely to derive pleasure at work. They explain this seemingly paradoxical finding by noting that some individuals do not experience utility from meaning.Using German time use data, Wolf et al.

        <p>Our research fundamentally differs from these contributions. Specifically, we explicitly focus on meaningful work rather than related concepts such as socially useless work as in Dur and van Lent (2019) . Moreover, we demonstrate that meaningful work determines relevant economic outcomes, such as retirement, training, and absenteeism. This implies that subjective evaluations of meaningful work relate to important behavioural consequences and, as such, are of interest to labour economists.Our research fundamentally differs from these contributions.

        <p>We rely on three waves of the European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS), conducted in 2005, 2010, and 2015 ( European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, 2007;2012;2017;2019 ). The EWCS is a well-known data source for studying the wellbeing implications of working conditions (see, for example, Aleksynska, 2018;Caroli and Godard, 2016;Cottini and Lucifora, 2013 ). While the survey is performed every five years since 1990/1, our analysis is constrained to the 2005-2015 waves due to the availability of key variables for our research. We note that the related dataset -International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) -which included work orientations modules in 1989, 1997, 2005, and 2015, asks respondents whether their job is useful to society ( Dur and van Lent, 2019 ), but not about other aspects of engaging in meaningful work such as job fulfillment. Another disadvantage of this dataset is that the country coverage has changed over time.We rely on three waves of the European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS), conducted in 2005, 2010, and 2015 ( European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, 2007;2012;2017;2019 ).

        <p>Shedding light on the causes and consequences of meaningful work requires appropriately measuring the underlying concept. At the outset, we acknowledge that this is a challenging task because of the lack of consensus on the concept's measurement. The most well-established and widely-used scale in the psychology literature is the Work and Meaning Inventory (WAMI) ( Bailey et al., 2019a;Steger et al., 2012 ). WAMI captures aspects of positive meaning (i.e. having a career that one considers meaningful), meaning-making through work (i.e. work that helps the respondent to make sense of the world around him/her), and greater good motivations (i.e. having a job that is useful to society). Unfortunately, no nationally representative survey to date has included the WAMI questionnaire and it is unclear whether this scale is indeed valid and reliable in such contexts.Shedding light on the causes and consequences of meaningful work requires appropriately measuring the underlying concept.

        <p>Ours is the first attempt to systematically study meaningful work perceptions using existing nationally-representative data and should be seen as the starting point for future investigations. Our meaningfulness of work measure is therefore based on available questions from the EWCS that most closely match the conceptual definition of meaningful work based on the literature. Specifically, we identified one question reflecting greater good motivations -having the feeling of doing useful work. Second, we include a variable based on whether work is a source of fulfillment, i.e. whether the respondent's job gives the feeling of work well done. These two variables were also the basis of a summative meaningful work index used by Eurofound (2012) based on the 2010 EWCS. While the 2015 EWCS survey contains a question about not doubting the importance of one's work, which would have also been relevant to us, we choose these two variables as they are consistently available in all three survey waves that we use. The majority of responses and the medians for both variables are concentrated in the "strongly agree " or "agree " categories, which indicates low variation in the distribution of responses. About 5% of respondents disagree or strongly disagree about the usefulness of their job and work giving them the feeling of work well done.Ours is the first attempt to systematically study meaningful work perceptions using existing nationally-representative data and should be seen as the starting point for future investigations.

        <p>We combine the two variables into an index by extracting the first component of a polychoric principal component analysis (PCA), which is a well-established data reduction procedure. Standard PCA assumes that the underlying data are continuous and normally distributed. As this is not the case for our variables, we relied on the polychoric version of PCA, which assumes that variables are ordered measurements of an underlying continuum and is therefore better suited for categorical variables ( Olsson, 1979 ). Polychoric PCA exploits the linear combinations of the polychoric correlation matrix of the input variables and preserves the ordinal or binary nature of the variables ( Olsson, 1979 ). The two variables that we use to create the index -the perceptions of doing useful work and a job well done -are relatively highly correlated: the simple Pearson's correlation coefficient is 0.6 and Cronbach's 𝛼 is 0.75, which is a good starting point for using PCA. The first principal component accounts for 85% of the total variance (eigenvalue = 1.71). Meanwhile, the second component explained only 15% of the total variance and had an eigenvalue of 0.29. Following the Kaiser rule, we keep only the first principal component, which we rescale to range between 0 and 100 for ease of interpretation. The violin plot in Fig. 2 demonstrates that the majority of observations are concentrated in the range between 75 to 100 and the median respondent in our sample is at about 90.We combine the two variables into an index by extracting the first component of a polychoric principal component analysis (PCA), which is a well-established data reduction procedure.

        <p>Following the conceptual framework outlined in Section 2.2., our key independent variables include measures of autonomy, competence, and relatedness, which we construct using polychoric PCA (see Table A.2 in the Appendix).Following the conceptual framework outlined in Section 2.2., our key independent variables include measures of autonomy, competence, and relatedness, which we construct using polychoric PCA (see Table A.2 in the Appendix).</p>
        <p>Importantly, the measures of autonomy, relatedness, and competence do not reflect personal needs or the objective working conditions that employers have created, but rather capture the interplay between the needs and the environment. Therefore, the self-reported index of autonomy reflects the match between the working conditions and the worker's personal need for autonomy. As such, the measures for autonomy, competence, and relatedness capture the degree to which the worker perceives their innate needs to be satisfied.Importantly, the measures of autonomy, relatedness, and competence do not reflect personal needs or the objective working conditions that employers have created, but rather capture the interplay between the needs and the environment.

        <p>The autonomy index is based on variables capturing process and decision autonomy, such as the freedom to take a break at will, change or choose tasks, methods of work, and the speed of work, conducting self-assessments, and applying one's own ideas at work. The Cronbach's 𝛼, the scale reliability coefficient is 0.66. The first principal component accounts for 56% of the total variance (eigenvalue = 3.36). Meanwhile, the second component explained only 15% of the total variance and had an eigenvalue of 0.91. Other components explained even less of the variance, which is why we only kept the first extracted principal component.The autonomy index is based on variables capturing process and decision autonomy, such as the freedom to take a break at will, change or choose tasks, methods of work, and the speed of work, conducting self-assessments, and applying one's own ideas at work.

        <p>In addition, we incorporate variables capturing monetary compensation and effort, as well as proxies for career advancement prospects and job insecurity, as discussed in Spencer (2015). Our analyses also feature standard socio-economic, demographic, and job controls, such as age, gender, education, tenure, household size, presence of children in the household, marital status, whether the respondent is a public employee, the number of people the respondent supervises, company size, an indicator for having a permanent contract, and industry and occupation dummies. We do not include an indicator for part-time work due to the large number of missing observations in 2010. In addition, to account for meaningfulness spillovers, we control for whether the respondent has other jobs and whether they volunteer in their free time. We also include the following interview controls: interviewer fixed effects, the duration of the interview (in minutes), the presence of other people during the interview, and the interview month and day. All of these factors could influence subjective well-being responses ( Conti and Pudney, 2011;Rehdanz and Maddison, 2005 ), which necessitates their inclusion in the regressions. Finally, we incorporate survey wave and country dummies, which adjust for any common temporal shocks (e.g. recessions) over time and differences in labour market features and institutions between countries, such as the presence of minimum wage laws and employment protection programmes. We adjust for cost-ofliving differences in income across countries by dividing income by the Eurostat's Purchasing Power Parity index (see Table A.2 ).

        <p>Our results are correlational, as opposed to causal, for several reasons. First, individuals who value meaningful work likely self-select into jobs that provide intrinsic rewards and meaning. Therefore, traits such as intelligence, motivation, or pro-sociality could influence both job choice and meaningfulness perceptions. The pseudo panel strategy is an attempt to mitigate such concerns. Second, while intrinsic and extrinsic work rewards may influence meaningfulness, perceiving one's job as meaningful may influence effort, which in turn influences pay and intrinsic rewards. Ideally, we would have preferred to have individuallevel panel data and exogenous variation in working conditions that would have allowed us to control for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity and certain self-selection issues. Nevertheless, even though we only have pooled cross-sections, to the extent possible, we mitigate endogeneity issues by including a large set of covariates, country dummies, and interview controls.Our results are correlational, as opposed to causal, for several reasons.

Ideally, we would have preferred to have individuallevel panel data and exogenous variation in working conditions that would have allowed us to control for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity and certain self-selection issues. Nevertheless, even though we only have pooled cross-sections, to the extent possible, we mitigate endogeneity issues by including a large set of covariates, country dummies, and interview controls.</p>
        <p>Table 1 details our main results. Model (1), which is the basis for the computationally-intensive Shapley R 2 decomposition shown in Fig. 4 , includes a parsimonious set of controls. Model (2) is our baseline specification that features all key independent variables based on our conceptual framework, as well as the full set of socio-demographic controls, year and country fixed effects, and interview controls. Models (3)-(5) add interaction terms, which absorb additional variation in work meaningfulness and account for further heterogeneity. Model (3) considers the possibility of differences in meaningfulness perceptions across workers in the same industry, but in different occupations. In Model (4), the education × occupation dummies account for differences in meaningful work perceptions across people with the same level of education, but working in different occupations. In Model (5), we allow for the possibility of meaningfulness differences across people working in the same occupation, but living in different countries.Table 1 details our main results.

        <p>Table 1 demonstrates that both the magnitudes and the statistical significance of the coefficient estimates remain stable across these different specifications. Autonomy, relatedness, and competence are all positively associated with meaningfulness, whereby, for example, a 10point increase in autonomy corresponds to an increase of 1.3-1.4 points in meaningfulness, which appears rather modest in magnitude. Nevertheless, autonomy accounts for a significant share of the variation in meaningfulness, as shown in Fig. 4 below. Meanwhile, income and benefits are not associated with meaningfulness, which is an interesting result. The raw correlation coefficient between income and meaningfulness is also rather low ( 𝜌 = 0.04), which implies that meaningfulness mostly reflects non-pecuniary work aspects. Future research should ex-plore in greater detail the relationship between work meaningfulness and income and whether and to what extent income is a necessary precondition for motivation and meaning.Table 1 demonstrates that both the magnitudes and the statistical significance of the coefficient estimates remain stable across these different specifications.

        <p>Perceptions of career advancement and job insecurity matter for meaningfulness in the expected directions, and longer working hours decrease meaningfulness, suggesting that excessive work intensity may limit the ability to derive work meaningfulness. Public sector employees have higher work meaningfulness compared to similar workers in the private and nonprofit sectors. Meanwhile, the number of working days, having a permanent contract, working multiple jobs, and supervising others do not influence work meaningfulness, but respondents working in smaller firms have higher meaningfulness perceptions, compared to those working in larger firms. This finding may at first appear at odds with the positive relationship between relatedness and meaningfulness. Nevertheless, the negative coefficient on the firm size dummies is likely capturing aversion to hierarchy and preferences for autonomy (Benz &amp; Frey, 2008).Perceptions of career advancement and job insecurity matter for meaningfulness in the expected directions, and longer working hours decrease meaningfulness, suggesting that excessive work intensity may limit the ability to derive work meaningfulness.

        <p>Furthermore, more educated respondents experience their jobs as less meaningful compared to workers with an elementary education, which is a finding worthy of further explorations. This seemingly paradoxical result is consistent with models of job crafting, according to which lowskilled individuals are able to see beyond their immediate tasks and find meaningfulness and purpose in seemingly menial tasks ( Both-Nwabuwe et al., 2017;Wrzesniewski and Dutton, 2001 ). Finally, women experience their jobs as more meaningful, compared to men with the same working conditions, though the finding is not robust across all specifications in Table 1 .Furthermore, more educated respondents experience their jobs as less meaningful compared to workers with an elementary education, which is a finding worthy of further explorations.

        <p>Model (2) of Table 1 also includes occupation and industry fixed effects. Fig. 3 graphically summarises the differences in meaningfulness between occupations and industries, based on the regression coefficients from Model (2) in Table 1 . Plant and machine operators, professionals, service and sales workers, and technicians find their jobs more meaningful compared to managers. The craft and related trades industry is the occupation with the greatest meaningfulness score, likely due to the creative nature of these jobs. In addition, workers in all industries except certain services industries find their jobs less meaningful than those working in the agricultural sector. In summary, the occupational and industry fixed effects point to a pattern whereby workers in the service industry and those in occupations providing creativity and autonomy tend to have greater meaningfulness perceptions.Model (2) of Table 1 also includes occupation and industry fixed effects.

        <p>Next, using Shapley-based decompositions ( Israeli, 2007;Shorrocks, 2013 ) we empirically demonstrate the relative importance of key job characteristics for meaningful work. The Shapley-based decomposition method extracts the separate contribution to the explained variation in meaningfulness of each included independent variable. Specifically, Fig. 4 indicates the relative contribution to the overall R 2 explained by the different factors in Model (1) in Table 1 . Our proxies for autonomy, competence, and relatedness account for 60% of the variation in meaningfulness of work. Income and benefits together account for less than half a percent. All in all, income, benefits, job insecurity, career advancement, and working hours explain about 13% of the variation in meaningfulness. The key insight from Fig. 4 is that intrinsic rewards from work are about 4.6 times more important for meaningfulness compared with compensation and other extrinsic factors. Meanwhile, relatedness is the most important determinant of work meaningfulness.Next, using Shapley-based decompositions ( Israeli, 2007;Shorrocks, 2013 ) we empirically demonstrate the relative importance of key job characteristics for meaningful work.

        <p>Our main analyses exclude the self-employed because of a lack of information on the questions comprising the relatedness index, as well as those pertaining to benefits and performance pay and permanent contracts. Nevertheless, the self-employed enjoy greater mental health and subjective well-being compared to similar regular employees ( Benz and Frey, 2008;Binder and Coad, 2013;Blanchflower and Oswald, 1998;Hessels et al., 2018;Nikolova, 2019;Nikolova and Graham, 2014 ). This well-being premium is often attributed to the utility of being your own boss and having autonomy and flexibility ( Benz and Frey, 2008;Hyytinen et al., 2013 ) 1).Our main analyses exclude the self-employed because of a lack of information on the questions comprising the relatedness index, as well as those pertaining to benefits and performance pay and permanent contracts.

        <p>In light of these studies, we explore the relationship between selfemployment and work meaningfulness by omitting the control variables that are not available for the self-employed sample, namely the relatedness index, benefits and performance pay, and permanent contracts. To our knowledge, this is the first exploration of work meaningfulness differences related to self-employment. Model (1) in Table 2 demonstrates that the self-employed enjoy higher levels of work meaningfulness, com-pared to private-and public-sector employees with similar working conditions and autonomy and competence levels.In light of these studies, we explore the relationship between selfemployment and work meaningfulness by omitting the control variables that are not available for the self-employed sample, namely the relatedness index, benefits and performance pay, and permanent contracts.

        <p>Furthermore, in Models ( 2) and (3), we explore whether autonomy and competence matter more for the self-employed compared to private and public employees. Both autonomy and income seem to have stronger associations with work meaningfulness in the self-employed sample, yet career advancement possibilities and working hours are more strongly associated with meaningfulness for the non-self-employed group. Income is statistically significant in these regressions likely due to the omission of the performance pay and benefits variable. It also matters more for the meaningfulness of the self-employed.Furthermore, in Models ( 2) and (3), we explore whether autonomy and competence matter more for the self-employed compared to private and public employees.

        <p>Even though our estimation strategy only allows us to show conditional correlations rather than causal results, in Table 3 we present several robustness checks, which increase confidence in our results and conclusions. First, in Model (1), we adjust for the possibility that the results are driven by differences in the sample sizes across countries. Specifically, we re-estimate our main regressions using the inverse of the number of observations per country as a weight. The results remain virtually unaltered compared to those in Model (2) of Table 1 , with the only notable difference being the marginally statistically significant coefficient estimate for income.Even though our estimation strategy only allows us to show conditional correlations rather than causal results, in Table 3 we present several robustness checks, which increase confidence in our results and conclusions.

        <p>Furthermore, in Model (2) of Table 3 , we create a pseudo panel whereby the level of analysis is a cohort comprised of respondents of the same age group, gender, marital status, education level, and living in the same country. The results are very similar to our baseline specifications. While we do not have a panel data set with observations on the same individuals followed over time, the pseudo panel findings provide suggestive evidence that our main conclusions will likely hold in a panel setting as well. 3), we report the results using the simple average of the variables comprising the meaningful work index. The results are virtually identical to the main findings in Model (2) in Table 1 , likely due to the fact that we only use two variables to construct the index. In the case of two inputs, the PCA and the simple average of the inputs often give similar results. In Model (4), we also address the concern that satisfaction with working conditions already captures objective and subjective working conditions, which may render work meaningfulness superfluous. If this was true, controlling for job satisfaction would yield the coefficient estimates on the key independent variables statistically insignificant. Model (4) in Table 3 demonstrates that this is not the case. Therefore, autonomy, relatedness, and competence matter for work meaningfulness above and beyond job satisfaction.Furthermore, in Model (2) of Table 3 , we create a pseudo panel whereby the level of analysis is a cohort comprised of respondents of the same age group, gender, marital status, education level, and living in the same country.

        <p>Finally, Models ( 5) and ( 6) of Table 3 differentiate between respondents who started a new job in the past two years vs. those working in the same firm for at least 2 years. Through these specifications we test whether there is a honeymoon effect after a job switch ( Chadi and Hetschko, 2018;Georgellis and Yusuf, 2016 ), whereby respondents perceive their jobs as meaningful due to the excitement related to the new job (i.e. the "magic of the new ") rather than the actual working conditions. Comparing the coefficient estimates in Models ( 5) and ( 6) indicates that the associations between autonomy, competence, and relatedness are slightly stronger for new employees, providing some support of the "magic of the new "hypothesis. Nevertheless, the differences between Models ( 5) and ( 6) and those in the main specification appear minimal.Finally, Models ( 5) and ( 6) of Table 3 differentiate between respondents who started a new job in the past two years vs. those working in the same firm for at least 2 years.

        <p>In an additional robustness check shown in Appendix Table A.4 , we also address the issue of loss of information and potential bias arising from dropping observations with missing information. Specifically, we create an additional category for missing information for all independent variables except autonomy, relatedness, and competence. Where the original variable is continuous, we create quartiles, and treat the variable as categorical with missing observations being the fifth category. The missing category for these variables has no particular interpretation but only serves to preserve the number of observations. The results demonstrate that the main patterns we identify in Model (2) of Table 1 still hold when we account for missing observations.In an additional robustness check shown in Appendix Table A.4 , we also address the issue of loss of information and potential bias arising from dropping observations with missing information.

        <p>In this section, we demonstrate that meaningfulness perceptions are important for economists because they predict labour market behaviours in expected ways. Specifically, we estimate the relationship between perceptions of meaningful work and the number of sick days, the probability of reporting working when sick, the likelihood of participating in training, and the desired retirement age. As such, we provide the first validation of meaningful work perceptions and highlight their usefulness for labour economists. Ideally, in line with the job satisfaction literature, we would have tested how well meaningful work perceptions predict actual or intended job quits ( Böckerman and Ilmakunnas, 2009;Clark, 2001;D'Ambrosio et al., 2018;Green, 2010;Lvy-Garboua et al., 2007 ). For example, Dur and van Lent (2019) show that individuals with socially useless jobs are more likely to report that they would like to change their jobs if they had the opportunity. Unfortunately, the EWCS lacks information on actual and intended job quits.In this section, we demonstrate that meaningfulness perceptions are important for economists because they predict labour market behaviours in expected ways.

        <p>Table 4 details the results. First, in Model (1), we show that individuals who perceive their work as meaningful are likely to report fewer sick days. The results imply that a ten-point increase in the meaningfulness index corresponds to a decrease in the number of sick days by 4%. Evaluated at the mean of about 8 days, a ten-point increase in work meaningfulness reduces absenteeism by a third of day a year. Nevertheless, respondents who find their work more meaningful are in fact less likely to work when sick. A ten-point increase in meaningfulness decreases the probability of working while sick by 2% (from a baseline probability of about 50%). Taken together, these results suggest that meaningful work increases effort (through reducing absenteeism), but not at the cost of damaging health (i.e. workers still remain home when sick).Table 4 details the results.

        <p>Furthermore, in Model (3), we demonstrate that a ten-point increase in meaningfulness corresponds to a 1% increase in the likelihood of participating in skills training programs. Finally, Model (4) shows that a ten-point increase in meaningfulness corresponds to a 2.5-year increase in the desired retirement age. The average intended retirement age in the sample is 63.1 years, which suggests that a ten-point increase in work meaningfulness could extend the age at which individuals wish to leave the workforce to about 66.

        <p>We are the first to empirically investigate the factors influencing meaningful work using nationally representative samples of working-age adults in 30 European countries. Using data from the 2005, 2010, and 2015 European Working Conditions Surveys, our findings show that the non-monetary aspects of work, such as relatedness, autonomy, and competence, have a 4.6 times stronger association with the meaningfulness of work than income, job insecurity, benefits, and working hours. Importantly, we demonstrate that work meaningfulness predicts workers' effort, as measured by absenteeism, skills training, and re-tirement intentions. As such, we identify perceptions of having meaningful work as an important complement to extant measures of job quality.We are the first to empirically investigate the factors influencing meaningful work using nationally representative samples of working-age adults in 30 European countries.

        <p>Our study provides the first insights on the topic of work meaningfulness in economics. As such, it opens an exciting new research agenda, which, in our view, should prioritise three aspects. First, this paper's insights could inform the development of a theoretical model that formally integrates self-determination theory into utility functions, which can guide future explorations of work meaningfulness in economics. Such a theoretical framework could extend the insights in Cassar and Meier (2018) by incorporating self-determination theory. Cassar and Meier (2018) follow the classical opportunity-cost view of labour and model individuals as deriving utility from both meaning and income and experiencing disutility from exerting effort. Each worker maximises utility by choosing an optimal level of effort ( Cassar and Meier, 2018 ). In contrast, self-determination theory posits that individuals are motivated when they feel that their own actions directly impact their personal goals, i.e. when they experience self-efficacy ( Ryan and Deci, 2000 ). Therefore, a model of meaningful work should take into account that the disutility of exerting effort is decreasing in motivation: the cost of effort is lower for more motivated workers. Furthermore, according to self-determination theory, there is a minimum level of motivation required to experience any utility from meaning. This threshold is a crucial element in modelling meaningful work; its omission severely limits our understanding of how and why workers might make decisions based on the meaningfulness of their work.Our study provides the first insights on the topic of work meaningfulness in economics.

        <p>Second, collecting and analysing longitudinal information on meaningful work perceptions is a logical extension of our research. A major advantage of the longitudinal design will be the repeated information on the same individuals over time, which should net out the influence of reporting bias in answering meaningful work questions as well as the influence of time-invariant norms and expectations. A panel dataset will also be helpful in studying the short-term and long-term stability and consistency in responses to meaningful work questions within and across individuals. Moreover, it will facilitate the exploration of whether current meaningful work levels predict labour market behavior in subsequent survey waves.Second, collecting and analysing longitudinal information on meaningful work perceptions is a logical extension of our research.

While self-reported meaningful work answers in part reflect these norms and expectations, unpacking the role of norms and expectations from that of actual working conditions is a crucial next step. Brown et al. (2012) provide two approaches to deepening our understanding of the role of norms and expectations in job satisfaction research, which can be applied to the study of work meaningfulness. First, they suggest complementing econometric analyses of job satisfaction with qualitative interviews about the role of extrinsic and intrinsic factors for job satisfaction answers. Second, the authors recommend explicitly controlling for norms and expectations in regression analyses by including variables measuring work orientations and job values. This is likely to be a viable way forward, yet it will be contingent on the clear conceptualisation and measurement of work orientations.Third, future research should investigate the interplay between the role of norms and expectations on the one hand and changing working conditions on the other for explaining variation in work meaningfulness.

        <p>In short, we envision that our contribution will inspire a new line of research into the causes and consequences of meaningful work. This research agenda can provide timely novel insights into how to organise the future of work in a meaningful and dignifying way at a juncture that the future of work is in flux. Meaningful work is becoming increasingly salient in light of the ongoing processes of automation and digitalisation, which are altering the nature of paid and unpaid work activities. Against this backdrop, understanding what job characteristics enhance or diminish meaningfulness can provide important guidance to policymakers and employers regarding boosting organisational performance and social functioning. Specifically, previous research shows that meaningful work is associated with higher productivity and lower turnover ( Ariely et al., 2008;Rosso et al., 2010 ). In addition, this paper shows that those engaged in meaningful work are likely to remain longer in the workforce, which has implications for health and well-being and can help solve current demographic challenges related to ageing populations and rising dependency ratios ( Nikolova and Graham, 2014 ). We also demonstrate that meaningful work can increase effort through reducing absenteeism and increasing the likelihood of participating in skills training.In short, we envision that our contribution will inspire a new line of research into the causes and consequences of meaningful work.

        <p>By furnishing not only material means, but also social identity and individual self-esteem, work is a pivotal part of human life. Since most adults spend a large part of their waking hours in work-related activities, understanding what factors make work a life-enriching and dignifying experience or, on the contrary, a degrading and meaningless one, can help design policies to enhance workers' well-being, boost organisational performance, and increase civic engagement and social welfare. Our findings underscore the importance of intrinsic factors for meaningfulness. Objective working conditions related to hierarchy, job insecurity, and working hours can create an important foundation enabling workers to gain meaningfulness from their jobs. However, it is autonomy, competence, and especially relationships at work that nourish and sustain meaningfulness. Future research should prioritise exploration of employer policies to encourage the satisfaction of these three innate needs, to promote meaningfulness in the workplace. The index is rescaled to range between 0-100 (higher score indicates a higher degree of perceived meaningfulness).By furnishing not only material means, but also social identity and individual self-esteem, work is a pivotal part of human life.
