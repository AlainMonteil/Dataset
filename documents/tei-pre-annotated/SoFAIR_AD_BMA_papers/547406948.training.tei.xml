        <p>Despite progress in gender equality and women's rights worldwide in recent years, gender inequality in business leadership is widespread. This is despite emphasis on the need to increase the presence of women in gover-nance and management positions. Family firms appear to provide an enabling environment for female family members with better opportunities to act as leaders and entrepreneurs than non-family firms (e.g. Campopiano et al., 2019). According to the UK Family Business Sector Report 2019-2020(IFB Research Foundation, 2020), family-owned small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are more likely to have female leaders (81.1%) than nonfamily firms (52.6%). Evidence from the Small Business Survey (BEIS, 2018) shows that 81.3% of family SMEs have at least one woman in a leadership role (owner, partner or director). Although this proportion declines as the size of the family firm increases, it is always greater than the equivalent figure for non-family SMEs, giving women a stronger presence in family firms' leadership. Moreover, 22.6% (14.4%) of family (non-family) SMEs reported in 2018 that over half of their directors, owners or partners were women.Despite progress in gender equality and women's rights worldwide in recent years, gender inequality in business leadership is widespread.

        <p>Family firms are organizations controlled and usually managed by several family members with a long-term vision that is potentially sustainable across generations (Chua et al., 1999). Family firms are the most common business entities worldwide, especially among SMEs, and contribute substantially to wealth and employment creation (D'Angelo et al., 2016;De Massis et al., 2018). In such firms, family and firm dimensions are intimately intertwined: family interests and involvement often impact firm behaviour; conversely, involvement in the business tends to influence family dynamics and preferences (Amore et al., 2017). These characteristics of family involvement and emotional bonding make family firms unique (Miller &amp; Le Breton-Miller, 2021). Despite women having historically played-and continuing to play-an important role in family firms, to date, women's involvement has rarely been incorporated into the family business research agenda (Hamilton, 2006). We still know little about the importance, uniqueness, recognition and contributions of female family members within family firms (Al-Dajani et al., 2014). The lack of attention in the literature is despite the fact that 'the survivability of many family businesses in the future will depend on more awareness of, and more options for, women' (Gersick, 1990, p. 119). As Sharma (2004, p. 14) points out, very little research has been undertaken 'to explore the contextual and individual factors that encourage these women into leadership positions, their performance goals in term of family and business dimension, or the leadership and managerial styles adopted by them, pointing toward an interesting and ripe area for serious study'.Family firms are organizations controlled and usually managed by several family members with a long-term vision that is potentially sustainable across generations (Chua et al., 1999).

        <p>A literature review that integrates research on an emerging topic, such as women's involvement in family firms (WIFF), serves as a reference point to advance knowledge, since a review not only enables integration of knowledge within a subject domain but also stimulates debate on its future development (Post et al., 2020). To quote Nobel Laureate André Gide, 'each wave owes the beauty of its line only to the withdrawal of the preceding one'. His comments help us recognize how a review article can transform existing studies into a new study 'with the purpose of transforming other authors' published work into a knowledge space that becomes publicly available' (Patriotta, 2020(Patriotta, , p. 1275)). To date, several literature reviews on WIFF have been conducted to determine what is known about the field (see Table 1).A literature review that integrates research on an emerging topic, such as women's involvement in family firms (WIFF), serves as a reference point to advance knowledge, since a review not only enables integration of knowledge within a subject domain but also stimulates debate on its future development (Post et al., 2020).

        <p>Although these studies have made significant contributions to the field, two important limitations remain. First, research on WIFF is still fragmented and only occasionally discussed in family-firm literature (Martínez-Jimenez, 2009), with little systematic research (Sharma, 2004). The second limitation concerns a lack of clarity regarding the theoretical perspective adopted by extant research (Campopiano et al., 2017). This fragmentation of the literature is common in relatively new research fields that have yet to reach maturity (Rialti et al., 2019;Vallaster et al., 2019). Moreover, the time factor must be considered. The number of publications on WIFF grew considerably during 2017-2019, and thus a significant number of publications are missing from the earlier analyses. Sharp increases in not only the overall number of research studies but also those within emergent sub-fields means that periodic literature reviews are necessary to keep track of how the field is developing (Feng et al., 2017).Although these studies have made significant contributions to the field, two important limitations remain.

        <p>To address these shortcomings and build on generated insights, this review aims to develop an integrative framework of the WIFF field that synthesizes the available research and proposes new research opportunities for the future. To this end, three research questions (RQs) are formulated: (RQ1) what is the current status of the literature on the causes, behaviour and effects of the WIFF? (RQ2) What are the theoretical and methodological approaches that underpin research on the WIFF? (RQ3) What are the implications and opportunities for future research suggested by our findings? Thus, we conduct a two-tier review consisting of a bibliometric analysis and a literature review. Bibliometric analysis uses quantitative methods to examine the patterns of publication within a field. Bibliometric tools allow us to carry out a systematic, transparent and replicable review on which to conduct an analysis of extant research, and to provide a comprehensive knowledge map of the research field (e.g. Brito-Ochoa et al., 2020;Kraus et al., 2020). Through clustering algorithms, bibliometrics systematizes and automates the selection, ordination and visualization of information, which enables the replication of the process (Cobo et al., 2011). After mapping the WIFF knowledge domain using bibliographic coupling analysis, we complement our review with a traditional literature review, which involves an analysis and interpretation of the bibliometric map. The complementarity of these two methods justifies their suitability for the analysis of emerging research fields (e.g. Rialti et al., 2019;Vallaster et al., 2019), providing a solid foundation for identifying key This systematic literature review of 35 articles on gender-related factors in family-firm succession identifies three categories of factors: environment and context, people and processes. aspects of the topic and speculating on new perspectives or directions for the WIFF research. On this basis, the objectives of this review are: (1) to show the growth and evolution of the topic over time for a useful historical perspective on the presence of the WIFF research in the literature up to the present; (2) to shed light on the field's current areas of interest through bibliographic coupling analysis, which enables identification of clusters representing the latest research themes in the WIFF field; andTo address these shortcomings and build on generated insights, this review aims to develop an integrative framework of the WIFF field that synthesizes the available research and proposes new research opportunities for the future.

        <p>This review contributes significantly to building bridges between the literature on gender and that on the family firm. Researchers can better understand the field if they know which topics are currently being investigated, which are under-represented, and what theoretical and methodological perspectives are used. Our study can help formulate new RQs that shape the development of this emerging research field. Moreover, our review is particularly relevant for practitioners and policymakers, who have expressed interest in knowing more about and recognizing the work carried out by women in businesses, including family firms. The process of integrating women into business organizations and leadership roles not only depends on gender equity, but also could be enhanced if institutions focus on encouraging and supporting women who want to start, run and grow a business. Family firms are good vehicles for supporting these aspirations. Moreover, our review responds to calls for the use of different methods in undertaking literature reviews (Breslin &amp; Bailey, 2020). To the best of our knowledge, no review has explored the WIFF literature by applying a bibliometric analysis, while a literature review has not yet been published.This review contributes significantly to building bridges between the literature on gender and that on the family firm.

        <p>First, we collected bibliographic information by ensuring extensive coverage of women and gender-and family-firm-related research. There are several sources for accessing data, including the Web of Science (WoS), Scopus and 
            <rs type="software">Google Scholar</rs>, but in this review, we used information provided by journals indexed exclusively in the WoS database of Clarivate Analytics, since the simultaneous use of other databases is unhelpful owing to duplication of records (Harzing &amp; Alakangas, 2016). The WoS database is used in many international rankings, such as the Academic Ranking of World Universities and the Times Higher Education World University Ranking, as it is considered the 'gold standard' database for measuring scholars' performance.

        <p>Then, a search was executed for all articles and reviews published up to December 2019 that contained search keywords related to WIFF. Search keywords were identified based on previous relevant reviews (e.g. Campopiano et al., 2017). The search process resulted in a dataset of 279 documents. The search was completed on 2 September 2020. Finally, we refined the dataset by excluding those that did not belong to the WIFF field. The main exclusion criterion was the use of the words 'women' and 'family' with some business terms but without any relationship to the familyfirm research domain. This procedure led to a final dataset of 225 articles.Then, a search was executed for all articles and reviews published up to December 2019 that contained search keywords related to WIFF.

        <p>Science mapping techniques are one of the main pillars of bibliometrics. They explore relational aspects that identify document-document similarities. Bibliographic coupling and co-citation analyses are the most widely used citationbased techniques (Belussi et al., 2019), because each on its own can successfully cluster over 92% of the scien-tific corpus (Boyack &amp; Klavans, 2010). While bibliographic coupling analyses citing documents, co-citation analysis focuses on cited documents (Cobo et al., 2011). On the one hand, co-citation analysis associates papers that have been co-cited in the reference list of previous papers, so that the information used to establish the similarity relationship between documents is retrospective. This technique is widely used to identify key papers in a research field, capturing the origins of that field (Kovacs et al., 2015). On the other hand, bibliographic coupling links documents that reference the same set of cited documents and is used to assess the similarity between citing articles. This technique is forward-looking and is more appropriate for studying emergent literature fields and capturing current research trends within a field (e.g. Boyack &amp; Klavans, 2010;Vogel &amp; Güttel, 2013).Science mapping techniques are one of the main pillars of bibliometrics.

        <p>Since method selection depends on the questions the literature review sets out to answer, in this review we used bibliographic coupling to provide a prospective approach in the emerging field of WIFF. Bibliographic coupling associates papers that have similarities in their reference lists, indicating the probability of a shared related topic. The 
            <rs type="software">VOSviewer</rs> software tool (Van Eck &amp; Waltman, 2010) was used to perform the bibliographic coupling analysis, using normalization of associations and the full counting algorithm (Prashar &amp; Sunder, 2020).

        <p>Analysis of our dataset by publication year allows us to illustrate the evolution of articles available in the WoS on WIFF research (Figure 1). The first article in the WoS was published in 1991 and, since then, the field has attracted growing interest in the literature, particularly since 2015. We identified three stages in the evolution of WIFF literature: an initial stage (1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002) with only 10 articles; a pre-expansion stage (2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014) with 58 publications and growth in the number of articles published each year, except 2008; and an expansion stage (2015)(2016)(2017)(2018)(2019) showing significant growth in publications, with 157 published articles representing approximately 70% of the dataset. The significant growth in the number of publications on WIFF may be due to a number of reasons. These include increasing awareness of the need to make advances in the field by researchers, an increase in the number of journals in the fields of both gender and family-firm research, and greater openness by journals to contributions on this subject.Analysis of our dataset by publication year allows us to illustrate the evolution of articles available in the WoS on WIFF research (Figure 1).

        <p>Bibliographic coupling analysis groups articles in accordance with the similarities between citing documents that reference the same set of cited documents. The larger the number of references cited in common in two publications, the stronger the bibliographic coupling relationship between these documents (Van Eck &amp; Waltman, 2010). Fol-lowing this criterion, 
            <rs type="software">VOSviewer</rs> algorithmically classified the WIFF dataset into five clusters based on assigning citing papers to clusters when they cite one or more documents in common. The results of the bibliographic coupling analysis are presented visually in Figure 2 by means of a map indicating thematic clusters. The nodes (circles) represent the articles that were labelled with the surname of the first author. The location of each node and its colour are used to group the articles from the same cluster, while the size of each node depends on the weight of the articles (citations of each article).
        </p>
        <p>We identified the most popular keywords (word count) used by the authors of the articles in each cluster, excluding those used as 'search keywords', since these keywords are a good approximation to reveal their content (Bengoa et al., 2021). The subsequent reading of the titles and abstracts allowed us to assign a definitive heading to each cluster. 1 These are: (1) female entrepreneurs and family firms; (2) women in family-firm governance; (3) family-business dynamics; (4) women in business succession; and (5) temporal and spatial dimensions of women's involvement. Figure 2 presents the heading assigned to each cluster. Table 3 presents the distribution of the 225 WIFF articles in each thematic cluster.We identified the most popular keywords (word count) used by the authors of the articles in each cluster, excluding those used as 'search keywords', since these keywords are a good approximation to reveal their content (Bengoa et al., 2021).

        <p>The decision to engage in a business is generally influenced by a prospective business owner's personal characteristics and personality, motivations and background, the nature of the new business opportunity, economic conditions and the institutional environment, among other factors.The decision to engage in a business is generally influenced by a prospective business owner's personal characteristics and personality, motivations and background, the nature of the new business opportunity, economic conditions and the institutional environment, among other factors.</p>
        <p>There is a general agreement that a pivotal factor determining women's entrepreneurship is the level of family support, both affective and instrumental. The relationship between business and family, and specifically, between family social capital and family involvement, is perceived as the most important determinant of women's entrepreneurial development (Venugopal, 2016*;Welsh &amp; Kaciak, 2018*, 2019*;Welsh et al., 2014b*). Family firms that are started by a family perform better than do firms launched without family support (Welsh et al., 2018*). Family social capital support usually comes in the form of networks for business contacts, information channels and family values and culture (Somalingam &amp; Shanthakumari, 2015*). In some socio-cultural environments which develop in a constant dynamic between tradition and modernity, female entrepreneurs' practices depend on family support and other factors, such as education, social class, economic openness and accessibility of information (Constantinidis et al., 2019*;Luo &amp; Chong, 2019*;Welsh et al., 2014a*).There is a general agreement that a pivotal factor determining women's entrepreneurship is the level of family support, both affective and instrumental.

        <p>Entrepreneurial households are another decisive determinant of attitudes towards entrepreneurship (Carter et al., 2017*;Cieslik &amp; Van Stel, 2017*;Gras &amp; Nason, 2015*;Tognazzo et al., 2016*). In several studies, the parental role can explain the intention to engage in a business (Hoffmann et al., 2015*;Welsh et al., 2014a*). In other studies, having a spouse in business substantially increases the likelihood of the other spouse (woman) starting her own business or joining the family firm (Bruce, 1999*;Lin et al., 2000*). In general, having a family member doing business with or working in a family firm increases the likelihood of entrepreneurship (Kilenthong &amp; Rueanthip, F I G U R E 3 Integrative research framework for cluster 1: female entrepreneurs and family firms 2018*). However, sons rather than daughters benefit from having a father who is an entrepreneur or from joining a family firm (Aterido &amp; Hallward-Driemeier, 2011*;Ziemianski, 2018*). There is a general assessment that the entrepreneurial entry decision is not a gender-neutral phenomenon, nor is the mode of business entry.Entrepreneurial households are another decisive determinant of attitudes towards entrepreneurship (Carter et al., 2017*;Cieslik &amp; Van Stel, 2017*;Gras &amp; Nason, 2015*;Tognazzo et al., 2016*).

        <p>Prior work and prior entrepreneurship experience are both associated with a higher likelihood of starting and continuing a business or becoming self-employed (Fairlie &amp; Robb, 2009*;Liguori et al., 2018*;Lin et al., 2000*). An early entrepreneurship experience is often viewed as an opportunity to learn by doing and to gain authentic experience; however, women are less likely to start another business following entrepreneurial failure than men are (Bau et al., 2017*). Women are considered to be less selfconfident in their entrepreneurial skills than men and to be more risk averse, which in turn can affect their entry or reintegration into the business world (Mills &amp; Pawson, 2012*;Yang &amp; Triana, 2019*). They typically start their businesses with less financial capital and are more reliant on family funding, making use of sources of microcredit if they need external funding (Acheampong, 2018*). Moreover, female entrepreneurs are more likely to found a business alone or with family members than male entrepreneurs, especially when they lack social capital (Lim &amp; Suh, 2019*). Moreover, women are less likely to take over a business than to start one from scratch (Kay &amp; Schloemer-Laufen, 2016*). Traditional gender roles may also lead women to self-restrict their business and entrepreneurship activities to 'feminized' sectors, such as personal and care services, restaurant and tourism industries, design, fashion and the arts (Cicek et al., 2017*).Prior work and prior entrepreneurship experience are both associated with a higher likelihood of starting and continuing a business or becoming self-employed (Fairlie &amp; Robb, 2009*;Liguori et al., 2018*;Lin et al., 2000*).

        <p>The desire to leave a legacy as both a source of motivation and a source of variation over time for entrepreneurs has also been analysed (Banchik, 2019*;Fox &amp; Wade-Benzoni, 2017*;Ng &amp; Fu, 2018*). In some contexts, a key determinant of the decision to engage in an artisanal business is to follow in parents' footsteps, perpetuate a legacy and take the opportunity to have their own business (Gallego &amp; Rioja, 2007*;Igwe et al., 2019*;Ramadani et al., 2019*). Belonging to a disadvantaged minority within emerging and developing economies, or being a migrant, often results in women resorting to engaging in business activities, both necessity and opportunity driven (Bijedic &amp; Piper, 2019*;Mehtap et al., 2019*). Entrepreneurial activity is regarded as a means for women to break free from particular gendered constraints, with entrepreneurship seen as a vehicle for becoming empowered (Alkhaled &amp; Berglund, 2018*) and to overcome structural gender constraints (Vershinina et al., 2019*). Figure 3 provides a structured overview of the principal topics within cluster 1, which serve as an approximation to determine the knowledge structure of the research area.The desire to leave a legacy as both a source of motivation and a source of variation over time for entrepreneurs has also been analysed (Banchik, 2019*;Fox &amp; Wade-Benzoni, 2017*;Ng &amp; Fu, 2018*).

        <p>Integrative research framework for cluster 2: women in family-firm governance has been studied in great depth. However, recently, there has been more research interest in women in top-level positions within family firms. Most articles within this cluster were published in the last 3 years based on data collected from large listed firms, even though most family firms are SMEs. It should be noted that most studies analyse board gender diversity relative to the context of the specific country in which the research was conducted.Integrative research framework for cluster 2: women in family-firm governance has been studied in great depth.

We identified two main issues related to the gender diversity of boards: factors determining board gender diversity and the effects of gender diversity on firm outcomes.</p>
        <p>The literature on women's participation in boards and their connection to various outcomes is the most important issue in cluster 2. However, the findings do not show a clear picture regarding women. While some studies identify a positive relationship between gender and firm outcomes, others find no significant relationship or even a negative one. Among those which find a positive relationship, Terjesen et al. Several articles focus on the effects of board gender diversity on non-economic outcomes. Some studies suggest that having women on boards exerts a greater influence on corporate social responsibility (CSR) and social and ethical issues, highlighting the difference in the relationship between family and non-family businesses (Cruz et al., 2019*;Sial et al., 2019*;Sundarasen et al., 2016*). Thus, some studies explore the relationship between board gender diversity and CSR, assuming that CSR activities are the outcome of boards' decisions. Cruz et al. (2019*) propose that the combined effects of a female director, family affiliation and their insider status drive a firm's CSR agenda, and argue that a family female director can have more legitimacy and power to influence board decisions in favour of CSR activities. By contrast, Rodríguez-Ariza et al. (2017*) find that the degree of CSR is higher in non-family firms with women on the board than in family firms with women on the board, as the latter group of firms tend to be aligned with the family and behave in accordance with family orientation towards CSR. Similarly, Samara et al. (2019*) show that women on corporate boards can be used as a vehicle for the controlling owners of family firms to achieve economic goals and to improve the reputation of both the family and the business.The literature on women's participation in boards and their connection to various outcomes is the most important issue in cluster 2.

        <p>Studies also suggest that women are more likely to report and avoid fraud and irregularities, and that more ethical behaviour is expected of them. For instance, Ramdani and Van Witteloostuijn (2012*) suggest that an increase in the equity share of the largest shareholder of a firm decreases the likelihood of bribery and that bribery is more likely to occur when the principal owner is male rather than female. Ghafoor et al. (2019*) reveal that, among other factors, the presence of a female on the board provides active monitoring and oversight in reducing fraud. Nadeem et al. (2020*) conclude that women on boards in family firms increase social and environmental value creation in addition to economic returns.Studies also suggest that women are more likely to report and avoid fraud and irregularities, and that more ethical behaviour is expected of them.

        <p>Other studies provide evidence that the appointment of female directors is strongly related to family ownership, firm size and board size (Abdullah &amp; Ismail, 2016*;Bianco et al., 2015;Nekhili &amp; Gatfaoui, 2013*). These boards tend to have at least one woman in the boardroom, who maintains a family connection to the controlling shareholder (Bianco et al., 2015*). Saeed et al. (2016*) examine the determinants of board gender diversity in BRICS 4 economies, and show that board gender diversity is positively related to firm size and inversely related to corporate risk. However, other studies in emerging markets show a negative impact of family ownership on the proportion of female directors, although this relationship is reversed if the firm operates in international markets (Saeed et al., 2017*) or in the high-tech sector (Saeed et al., 2021*). Watkins-Fassler and Rodríguez-Ariza (2019*) provide evidence that family involvement and the presence of women on boards reduce the odds of internationalization, while according to Hernández-Lara and Gonzales-Bustos (2020*), the proportion of women on boards has a positive influence on innovation.Other studies provide evidence that the appointment of female directors is strongly related to family ownership, firm size and board size (Abdullah &amp; Ismail, 2016*;Bianco et al., 2015;Nekhili &amp; Gatfaoui, 2013*).

        <p>Other studies suggest the importance of examining intermediate variables, such as board involvement and board tasks, rather than the direct relationship between board gender diversity and financial or non-financial indicators. Arzubiaga et al. (2018*) find that the link between entrepreneurial orientation and performance is stronger in family firms with lower levels of family involvement and higher levels of gender diversity on the board. Other studies analyse board gender diversity in relation to the decision to disclose environmental, social and governance information voluntarily (Lagasio &amp; Cucari, 2019*;Muttakin et al., 2015*), firm risk information (Saggar &amp; Singh, 2017*;Salem et al., 2019*) and intellectual capital information in initial public offerings (Nadeem, 2020*), providing evidence that female directorships are linked to enhanced voluntary corporate disclosure, enhanced transparency and quality of financial reporting (Alfraih, 2016*). Other studies focus on the behaviour and dynamics of boards of directors by analysing, for example, rifts in the boards of family firms. For example, Vandebeek et al. (2016*) reveal a negative relationship between fault-lines and both board control and service role performance. Odehnalova and Pirozek (2018*) focus on strategic adaptability, showing that gender diversity and the representation of family members on boards positively influence the strategic adaptability of the business, even in times of crisis and recession. The literature also reveals a positive impact of the presence of female directors on family firms' risktaking behaviour (Mukarram et al., 2018a*; Poletti-Hughes &amp; Briano-Turrent, 2019*), which contrasts with the traditional notion that women are risk averse.Other studies suggest the importance of examining intermediate variables, such as board involvement and board tasks, rather than the direct relationship between board gender diversity and financial or non-financial indicators.

        <p>Finally, some studies analyse whether gender interactions at the top of the corporate hierarchy affect corporate performance, and find that female directors significantly improve the operating profitability of female-led firms (Bjuggren et al., 2018*); however, this positive effect is reduced when the firm is located in geographic areas characterized by gender prejudices and when the firm is large (Amore et al., 2014*). In this regard, the findings of Chadwick and Dawson (2018*) indicate that female-led firms outperform male-led firms in terms of non-financial performance across family and non-family firms. However, in financial terms, a positive relationship between female leaders and firm performance is found only in non-family firms. Nekhili et al. (2018*) argue that family firms offer women a more appropriate climate for exercising director functions. By contrast, female CEOs perform better in nonfamily firms, highlighting the importance of the organization and culture in which leaders operate.Finally, some studies analyse whether gender interactions at the top of the corporate hierarchy affect corporate performance, and find that female directors significantly improve the operating profitability of female-led firms (Bjuggren et al., 2018*); however, this positive effect is reduced when the firm is located in geographic areas characterized by gender prejudices and when the firm is large (Amore et al., 2014*).

        <p>The family-business literature considers the family firm as a system comprising at least two interconnected spheres, the family and the business, which overlap and interact over time; the word 'familiness' is a construct describing a firm's idiosyncratic bundle of resources and capabilities, resulting from the interactions between the family, its individual members and the business (Habbershon &amp; Williams, 1999). The central insight in cluster 3 is how family dynamics (e.g. norms, attitudes, values and resources) interact with business dynamics, since many business decisions (e.g. investments, resource mobilization and adoption of strategies) and goals and outcomes (e.g. performance, survival and success) are not only influenced by, but also exert an impact on, family-level factors (Aldrich &amp; Cliff, 2003).The family-business literature considers the family firm as a system comprising at least two interconnected spheres, the family and the business, which overlap and interact over time; the word 'familiness' is a construct describing a firm's idiosyncratic bundle of resources and capabilities, resulting from the interactions between the family, its individual members and the business (Habbershon &amp; Williams, 1999).

        <p>Many papers included in cluster 3, by putting the family at the heart of the research, reveal the complexities of the dynamics of family firms, developing a deeper understanding of the 'hidden' dimension of the role of women in businesses (Hamilton, 2006*). Social capital theory is used in this cluster to try to explain the mechanisms that enable the flow between family social capital and firm social capital, as well as the research model of sustainable family businesses, which recognize that work and family life are interconnected spheres with positive and negative bidirectional influences between work conditions and family outcomes, and vice versa (Danes et al., 2009*). These businesses are seen as an important source of flexibility provided by familial ties, but the family also imposes obligations which can contradict economic rationality (Ram &amp; Holliday, 1993 Some studies explore the strategies used by families to increase the success of both their business and family (Olson et al., 2003*) A group of articles focus on investigating the behavioural dynamics of co-preneurial couples, that is, cohabitating couples who share ownership of, responsibility for and commitment to an enterprise (Marshack, 1993). Co-preneurial couples represent the interaction of personal relationships and business partnerships, which can help to understand the boundaries between these spheres and the effects of this interrelation in the family and business (Marshack, 1994). These studies attempt to show the importance of co-preneurial couples and the complexity of their interactions for business success (e.g. Farrington et al., 2011*;Fletcher, 2010*;Hirigoyen &amp; Villeger, 2019*;McDonald et al., 2017*;Wu et al., 2010*). According to Fitzgerald and Muske (2002), one of the reasons for the growth of co-preneurship is the interest of women in starting a business, with gender and the division of labour being among the main research topics of these studies (Cole &amp; Johnson, 2007*). For example, Larsen (2006*) shows that couples organize their work into gendered tasks and workspaces, contributing to the maintenance of vertical segregation in the trainer position. Hamilton (2006*) reveals the 'hidden' dimension of the role of women in family firms, supporting the view of women as 'invisible' (Marshack, 1994). This could be considered a misogynistic attitude related to the distribution of power and resources in household and business roles in family firms (Kuzmanovic, 2019*). Hedberg and Danes (2012*) suggest that co-preneurial businesses, where spouses are seen as equal partners engaging in collaborative power interactions, are likely to result in a more productive business decision-making team that has resilience to solve important business problems creatively. Cole and Johnson (2007*) and Galbraith (2003*) analyse the relationship between marital dissolution and business continuity, showing that the couple's level of commitment to the business and trust in each other in this regard, the degree of synergetic work compartmentalization and positive gender attitudes contribute to the success of the business and working together post-divorce. According to Kuschel and Lepeley (2016*), other factors that can influence this success are workaholic tendencies and high degree of rationality of the couple.Many papers included in cluster 3, by putting the family at the heart of the research, reveal the complexities of the dynamics of family firms, developing a deeper understanding of the 'hidden' dimension of the role of women in businesses (Hamilton, 2006*).

Interest in this topic in recent years has been The role of women in these processes is the focus of several articles that highlight the importance of societal attitudes towards women and of family culture and attitudes regarding women's professional opportunities within the firm (Martínez-Jimenez, 2009*). Some articles present the primogeniture criterion as an historical reason for businesses traditionally being transferred from the father (or other male leader) to the first-born male offspring, mainly in patriarchal societies, a process resulting in the exclusion of women as potential successors. According to Byrne et al. (2021*), through discourse and interactions, family members have socially constructed the role of successors, which determines a hierarchy of potential successors framed by gendered stereotypes. In this socio-cultural context, gender bias selection can influence succession decision-making, including the choice of successor (Deng, 2015*;Gherardi &amp; Perrotta, 2016*;Ramadani et al., 2017a*). Primogeniture rules based on birth order or gender, but not competence, can have large and negative consequences for firm performance (Bennedsen et al., 2007*). Although the primogeniture criterion seems to be declining, it is still present in parts of the world. Kubiček and Machek (2019*) point out that the probability that an incumbent decides to sell the firm or appoint a non-family CEO rather than transfer leadership to the daughter, even if she is the only child, is still high in certain countries, which limits labour market selectivity (Ahrens et al., 2015*). However, contrary to previous studies on female succession, Deng (2015*) notes that successor selection has become driven by more objective criteria, and that daughters are groomed to run the family business and encouraged to become involved in it at an early stage, even in very traditional cultures, such as China. The leadership style of women has also been analysed in various studies. According to Vera and Dean (2005*), when daughters enter family firms, they have to gain respect from both business and family perspectives, and it can be difficult if parents do not view daughters as professionals.This cluster is composed of 34 articles focusing on women (daughters in particular) in family-firm succession, a topic that has not been widely explored in the literature.

        <p>*) suggest that daughters construct and negotiate their gender and leadership identities in their interactions with others by using the gendered scripts available to them. Since feminine leadership is more open and empathetic, and less competitive, 'these traits can efficiently reduce the conflict between the business and family spheres' (Kubiček &amp; Machek, 2019*, p. 992).

        <p>Several articles focus on identifying family firms in comparison with their non-family counterparts. The authors acknowledge that this task is not easy, as family firms are not homogeneous and pursue different objectives, both economic and non-economic, some of which are highly likely to coincide with those of non-family firms. Jorissen et al. (2005*), who consider demographic control variables, provide evidence that family and non-family firms of a certain size, age and in the same industry are not that different with regard to their number of actions. The real differences between family and non-family firms are that the former export less, are less engaged in formal shortterm planning and variable reward systems, and generate lower levels of profitability. Furthermore, CEOs of family firms hold lower-level educational degrees than do CEOs of non-family firms, enjoy longer tenures and are more often female than male. Rutherford et al. (2006*) identify key groups of variables that can help explain the development of family firms, but gender of the owner and the co-preneur ownership variables have no significant impact on firms' development. Machek's (2017*) findings suggest that family firms tend to be older, less profitable and compensate their employees less, but offer greater job security than non-family firms. Moreover, female-led family firms do not remunerate and dismiss employees differently from male-led firms. Howorth et al. (2010*) argue that the key to differentiating family and non-family businesses lies in the overlapping culture of family and business, highlighting the importance of considering the roles played by all family-firm members, including their 'invisible' members. Similarly, Van den Berghe and Carchon (2003*) argue that each family-firm type is characterized by a set of agency relations within and between the family, the ownership (non-family owners) and the business, and three interconnected social systems whereby strategy and firm outcomes depend on their interactions.Several articles focus on identifying family firms in comparison with their non-family counterparts.

        <p>The literature has also made significant efforts to understand the evolutionary process of family firms over time and to recognize the prominent role of some women who were far ahead of their time (Sampaio et al., 2017*). For instance, Tweedale (2013*) explores the development of cutlery firms in the late 19th century and provide evidence of the crucial role of women in most successful and wealthy entrepreneurs' careers. During the same period, in France, Khan (2016*) suggests that middle-class women were engaged extensively in entrepreneurship and innovation, and their efforts were significantly enhanced by association with family firms. Edvinsson (2016*) investigates the role of wives in the Swedish business elite in the early 1900s, showing how wives could be involved in family businesses as informal advisers. Muñoz and Perez (2007*) analyse women's participation in the Spanish economy from the early 19th century to the 20th century, and women's roles as managers, collaborative partners and self-employed business owners. Hernández and Martínez (2019*) analyse the role of widows in the early 1900s in Spanish businesses after the male firm owner passed away. The findings show that some widows controlled the company to preserve the inheritance to bequeath to their heirs. Rinaldi and Tagliazucchi (2021*) show that family is the only institution in which Italian female entrepreneurs seem to have found a space. Kinship and family ties have often been of paramount importance in allowing women to become entrepreneurial leaders, a route often barred within other corporate institutions.The literature has also made significant efforts to understand the evolutionary process of family firms over time and to recognize the prominent role of some women who were far ahead of their time (Sampaio et al., 2017*).

        <p>The literature also analyses the characteristics and development of family firms in different cultures and environments in which they are embedded. Parada et al. (2016*) highlight the importance of understanding the characteristics and behaviour of family firms in Ibero-America, an emerging regional economy with a specific collectivist culture in which close relationships are important. Several studies have focused on how gender, ethnicity, religion and business are actively interrelated in overseas Chinese family businesses (Du &amp; Zeng, 2019*;Entwisle et al., 1995*;Jiang et al., 2015*;Katila, 2010*). Adapa and Sheridan (2021*) reveal how women's careers in Malaysia are impacted by the interaction of gendered work practices, competitive pressures, stereotypical beliefs, ethnic influences and family business, recognizing that these normative processes and practices affecting gender are shaped by the religious and cultural context. Pirakatheeswari (2015*) shows how Indian society is male-dominated and women have lower status, which acts as a barrier to the development of women's entrepreneurship. Shaya and Khait (2017*) identify some of the social and cultural factors inducing the success of women in the United Arab Emirates, including changing institutional attitudes towards women around work-life balance and family support for leadership, by analysing the experiences of an elite group of Emirati women considered leaders in their fields. Smith (2009*) explores the definition of family and the cul-tural and legal-based rights of the extended family in East African countries, where women are not allowed to inherit property. The article also highlights the actions of business owners who take steps to protect their families and firms against free-riding relatives.The literature also analyses the characteristics and development of family firms in different cultures and environments in which they are embedded.

        <p>In summary, as Howorth et al.

        <p>Women's entry into the family business. Following an individual-level approach, much of the literature on women's entrepreneurship has focused on examining the supportive environment that women have and its influence on their entrepreneurial intentions. Social cognitive theory and the theory of planned behaviour are among the theoretical lenses most commonly used to understand women's entrepreneurial motivation and intention, and their subsequent entrepreneurial actions. In studies that analyse family dynamics in entrepreneurial processes, social capital, resource-based and identity theories are adopted to examine the influence of family social capital on female entrepreneurs, focusing on financial and TA B L E 5 Women's involvement in family firms: drivers and future research directionsWomen's entry into the family business.

        <p>Women's entry into business emotional support and networks. We highlight a shortage of studies that examine family dimensions and their influence on women's entrepreneurial experiences from a holistic perspective, despite numerous calls to broaden the family perspective in entrepreneurship research (e.g. Aldrich &amp; Cliff, 2003). To understand the complexities of these dimensions and determine causal relationships, future research could explore further family influence on women's entrepreneurial intentions and behaviour, using family dimensions as moderator variables. Studies could investigate how relationships among family members affect the behaviour of female entrepreneurs. Given that social exchange theory is based on social exchange, this approach could be an appropriate theoretical framework for examining relational processes in family firms and for studying the development of social capital (Long, 2011). Personal behaviour is formed by a complex interaction of social, interpersonal and psychological boundaries and norms (Marshack, 1993). Similarly, the nature of family ties-based on blood ties or legal/cohabiting ties-has an important personal and affective component (Brannon et al., 2013). The integration of theories of stewardship and social exchange can help to explain reciprocation and stewardship behaviour and exchange-level contributions to social capital (Discua- Cruz, 2020;Long, 2011;McLarty et al., 2019). Based on the social capital framework, research could investigate the relevance of moral structure, family norms and social interactions as mechanisms influencing women's entrepreneurship.Women's entry into business emotional support and networks.

        <p>Our review detects shortcomings in the contextual orientation of works. The individualistic rather than collective focus on female entrepreneurs predominates, which limits our understanding of contextual factors that might influence female entrepreneurship. This suggests the need for more detailed consideration of how socio-cultural background influences women's motivations and decisions to start a business and how institutional and cultural factors promote or hinder such entry. The study of perceptions and gender stereotypes and whether (and how) these factors can undermine women's capacity to lead a business is another promising topic of research. Given that gender stereotypes often align with managerial stereotypes, it would be interesting to analyse whether some particular cognitive traits can influence women's entrepreneurial behaviour. In addition, studies should consider different socio-cultural and family contexts that may act as potential barriers or drivers of behavioural change.Our review detects shortcomings in the contextual orientation of works.

        <p>It would be valuable to broaden our understanding of the factors shaping entrepreneurial attitudes from a psychological perspective, analysing the moderating role of such aspects as psychological and moral support or level of self-efficacy and self-confidence, among others. In line with recent calls for research (e.g. Sharma et al., 2020), we suggest incorporating variables from the psychology field to explain the behaviour of WIFF. Furthermore, given that entrepreneurship must be understood as a process over time, studies should go beyond the initial intention of starting a business. Longitudinal studies should examine whether the challenges and barriers that women face in later stages of the venture process change and, if so, how, in what ways and why. This methodological approach could provide vital evidence of changes over time, and changes among groups of female entrepreneurs.It would be valuable to broaden our understanding of the factors shaping entrepreneurial attitudes from a psychological perspective, analysing the moderating role of such aspects as psychological and moral support or level of self-efficacy and self-confidence, among others.

        <p>Studies on succession have revealed that primogeniture and gender bias emerge as determinants of family business succession. Leadership succession and gender-related issues, therefore, represent a promising research stream. The antecedents that determine the choice of successor are diverse and rich in nuance, and thus continue to be of great interest. Tradition and the desire to preserve the family legacy or avoid emotionally complex situations are among factors determining the choice of successor (Gómez-Mejía et al., 2011). To this should be added gender-related factors. Little is known about the influence of gender bias on intra-family succession and the incumbent-successor relationship. Our understanding of how successor identity is constructed during succession is also limited. As McAdam et al. (2020) assert, establishing legitimacy can be particularly challenging for daughter successors as they construct their role with male stereotypes. The social exchange perspective might help explain what factors determine incumbent-successor interactions, and family-successor relations (Daspit et al., 2016). Related to this issue is the need for further research on the transfer of knowledge from incumbents to successors, as it is considered key for a successful succession (Cabrera-Suárez et al., 2018). Thus, future research could delve into the interplay of knowl-edge management and succession, which could show different aspects of female successors' learning process and their influence on the success (or otherwise) of the succession. An interesting avenue of research on succession could explore both rational and emotional forces that influence these processes from a gender perspective.Studies on succession have revealed that primogeniture and gender bias emerge as determinants of family business succession.

        <p>Moreover, emotions can play a significant role when succession approaches, since it is arguably the most critical issue faced by family firms. Although ambivalent emotions are likely to arise during succession, little is known about the management of such emotions. We consider that in addition to the incumbent and successor, the expectations, feelings and perceptions of different stakeholders (e.g. family and non-family members) should be examined to incorporate the gender perspective. These emotions could be embedded in the atmosphere of the business and thus influence relationships, aspects which remain largely unexplored. Studies might be based on theories of emotions, since many failed successions have a psychological and cognitive component. These theoretical lenses would help to understand the factors that influence the satisfaction of family-firm stakeholders with the succession process, helping with the identification and design of strategies to make succession more successful.Moreover, emotions can play a significant role when succession approaches, since it is arguably the most critical issue faced by family firms.

        <p>Another area of study, identified by Kubiček and Machek (2019), is how the transition of managerial style affects the business, and whether the gender of the incumbent and the successor influences the transfer of leadership. Viewing the leadership transition through a micro-foundational lens may offer an opportunity to explore further the underlying mechanisms of family-firm succession. Micro-foundations of succession could contribute to the discussion of how the characteristics, actions and interactions of incumbents and successors determine firm-level behaviour and characteristics, or what is the goal of family business succession (De Massis &amp; Foss, 2018).Another area of study, identified by Kubiček and Machek (2019), is how the transition of managerial style affects the business, and whether the gender of the incumbent and the successor influences the transfer of leadership.

        <p>Furthermore, as the extant literature on family business succession is based on single or multiple case studies, generalized empirical findings are lacking. Therefore, quantitative research should also be undertaken to draw generalizable conclusions. It would also be interesting to analyse the succession process in different geographical locations because the socio-cultural context and legal requirements could discriminate against the succession of women in some countries.Furthermore, as the extant literature on family business succession is based on single or multiple case studies, generalized empirical findings are lacking.

        <p>Women's involvement in family firms and business families. The scant presence of women in decision-making positions is still a widespread phenomenon; hence, there has been significant growth in recent years of studies on women's participation in corporate governance. Many of these studies are based on data collected from listed companies that have gender quotas or follow good governance recommendations. It should also be noted that although the number of positions occupied by women in family firms seems to be greater than in their non-family counterparts, it is less common to find women as CEOs or chairs of boards. This suggests the need for more studies that explore women's presence in leadership positions, focusing on non-listed family firms across countries, and especially on family SMEs. Given that the principal methodological approach in the literature on women's participation in corporate governance has been quantitative, future research could use a qualitative or mixed-methods approach. This could deepen understanding of the obstacles that impede women's access to the highest decisionmaking levels.Women's involvement in family firms and business families.

        <p>In this area, future research could analyse whether the family and level of family ownership influence women's access to key leadership positions. Research should seek to interlink the family and the firm from the family perspective by integrating theories related to the family, as Jaskiewicz and Dyer (2017) propose. Given that family science research operates at the family level of analysis, this research perspective might help to explain how relationships, roles and transitions in the family affect the family firm (Combs et al., 2020). These studies may provide additional evidence to identify family members with the firm and facilitate analysis of differences between women and men regarding their emotional attachment to the business. Greater integration of family and business-related dimensions into studies of the family firm, where women play a fundamental role, should permit a more fine-grained analysis of the family's dynamic and emotional connections, bringing the woman's role in the entrepreneurial household and business out of the shadows. Future research on WIFF could be reinforced by integrating new theoretical perspectives, such as social exchange or family systems theories, to offer a more systemic perspective of the family-business interaction, as suggested by Marshack (1993). Such research could provide new perspectives on what kind of family relations affect or are affected by WIFF (e.g. Campopiano et al., 2017).In this area, future research could analyse whether the family and level of family ownership influence women's access to key leadership positions. Research should seek to interlink the family and the firm from the family perspective by integrating theories related to the family, as Jaskiewicz and Dyer (2017) propose. Given that family science research operates at the family level of analysis, this research perspective might help to explain how relationships, roles and transitions in the family affect the family firm (Combs et al., 2020).

        <p>Regarding theoretical approaches in studies of diversity at different levels of decision-making, our review identifies three business-grounded theories: agency theory, which is directly linked to the presence of diversity on boards and ownership structure; resource dependence theory; and the resource-based view of the firm, which is linked to diversity in top management. We consider it valuable to use other theories that provide alternative arguments to further understand the influence of gender diversity on strategic decision-making through its presence in family firms' governance and management positions. We observe that the WIFF literature has rarely used the dimension of socio-emotional wealth (SEW), which recognizes the existence of emotional attachment factors that may influence decision-making processes (Gómez-Mejía et al., 2011). As previous studies note (e.g. Chua et al., 2018;Miller &amp; Le Breton-Miller, 2021), the different characteristics and implications of family firms' members' influence on family firms' goals and on the creation and accumulation of SEW, represent an opportunity for future studies. Given that SEW is a reference point which works with a rational logic of choice for both economic and non-economic goals (Gómez-Mejía et al., 2007), a promising area of interest is analysing whether the presence of women in leadership positions of family firms (versus men in such roles) shapes family firms' SEW reference points. If so, how do leaders consider the motivations to preserve and improve SEW when making strategic decisions? In this area, we recommend that researchers focus on delving into the potential moderating influence of women in strategic decision-making. We also encourage researchers to include non-economic outcome variables to increase knowledge about family-firm uniqueness. In line with Chrisman's (2019) proposal, we suggest that future research should examine the integration of the stewardship perspective, since family-firm members can demonstrate high levels of stewardship owing to their emotional attachment to the business. If relational process is regarded as based on trust, commitment and 'norms of reciprocity', we could analyse relationships in family firms, and whether or not these relationships determine stewardship behaviour (Long &amp; Mathews, 2011;Pearson &amp; Marler, 2010). In this regard, we consider that attention should be paid to how gender diversity acts (or not) as a stewardship mechanism for effective governance that creates pro-organizational behaviour in family firms.Regarding theoretical approaches in studies of diversity at different levels of decision-making, our review identifies three business-grounded theories: agency theory, which is directly linked to the presence of diversity on boards and ownership structure; resource dependence theory; and the resource-based view of the firm, which is linked to diversity in top management.

        <p>Temporal and spatial dimensions of women's involvement in family firms. Business development is embedded in a complex network of social relationships where the barriers and obstacles to women's access to resources or opportunities vary according to the socio-cultural and economic context. Dimensions, such as culture, education and religion, should be considered important contextual factors in understanding women's entrepreneurship, their recruitment and presence in positions of power in businesses. Rules and patterns of kinship differ from culture to culture and define who belongs to the family, which can be fundamental in determining the influence of family support in the establishment of a business. Borrowing anthropological constructs, such as kinship (e.g. Peredo, 2003;Stewart, 2003), could enrich our understanding of how different family contexts influence women's entrepreneurship and WIFF. Based on these premises, we propose a study of contextual determinants of women's entrepreneurship and leadership in a broader international environment. While the literature on female entrepreneurs and leaders in developed countries is extensive and some studies have been conducted in developing and transitional economies, relatively little attention has been paid to other types of countries or different geographic areas (e.g. Arab and Islamic countries, Ibero-America and Africa), where family firms may act differently owing to cultural, ethnic or religious background. Future research should examine whether the conceptual models and empirical results obtained are validated in other geographical areas. Moreover, there is a strong bias towards single-country studies. This suggests the need for more comparative studies with detailed analysis of their particularities and contextual dynamics, examining the integration of social and country contexts as motivational drivers for WIFF.Temporal and spatial dimensions of women's involvement in family firms.

        <p>Understanding the invisibility of women in familyfirm research requires recognition that family firms are influenced by their historical context. Historians have focused on male entrepreneurs or family business owner-managers, often forgetting the presence and contribution of women. Co-preneurship can be considered a suitable context in which women set up a business and form partnerships with their husbands or partners. Therefore, increasing research on entrepreneurial couples could facilitate recognition of women's contributions to businesses in general and family firms in particular. It is necessary to re-analyse and re-write the history of family firms, by showing the participation and roles of women in developing the businesses. There are few studies focusing on women's entrepreneurship and firm ownership over time, and greater knowledge of this temporal dimension might enhance understanding of the evolution of contemporary family firms and the role and relevance of women in their development. Aspects to be considered include how barriers built over the years have influenced horizontal and vertical labour-market gender segregation, traditional patterns of occupational choices, the presence of women in decision-making positions and why women may respond differently to organizational actions. In addition, researchers should pay attention to the challenges female entrepreneurs face in setting up a business in non-traditional sectors for women. Even though the gender gap in entrepreneurship is narrowing, there is still an important level of gender segregation by industry (Micelotta et al., 2018), with women under-represented in leadership positions in almost the entire industrial sector. Despite improvements in career opportunities for women, gender inequality and hidden barriers to women working in some industries remain a reality owing to gender stereotypes, glass ceilings, etc. Future research should study the influence of the industrial sector on women's mode of entry into a new business and what factors are most influential in attracting women to male-dominated sectors. Longitudinal studies would deepen understanding of the position of women in leadership positions over time and could be replicated in different industrial sectors.Understanding the invisibility of women in familyfirm research requires recognition that family firms are influenced by their historical context.

        <p>It is also important to highlight that our review identifies a lack of attention to theory in many studies, with a large number operating at an observational and interpretational level. Many authors base their studies on the grounded theory approach to discover the nature of the RQs from interviews, observations, etc., following an inductive methodology. This is evidenced in cluster 4, which is related to succession, in which most studies are descriptive. It is highly likely that quantitative and qualitative methodologies, mixed approaches and longitudinal studies will be important tools to find answers to some existing and future questions. There should also be greater application of gender theories in the family-firm literature to consider WIFF from a holistic perspective, giving voice to different theoretical approaches, avoiding consideration of gender as a simple binary variable. Thus, there is a need for new theoretical and methodological perspectives in gender and family-business research, following a multidisciplinary approach.It is also important to highlight that our review identifies a lack of attention to theory in many studies, with a large number operating at an observational and interpretational level.

        <p>This work has the following research limitations. Some are related to the bibliometric methods applied to undertake the literature review. First, we highlight the importance of bibliometrics as an essential element of literature reviews. However, we acknowledge that bibliometric methods must be complemented with the fine-grained opinions of researchers. The second consideration is the database selected as the information source. The WoS is the most high-quality journal article database, although other databases could enrich the study. Third, although bibliometric analysis helps to significantly reduce subjectivity in literature reviews, it is not completely free of limitations. It requires the intervention of the researcher, who applies his or her expert criteria to define the 'search keywords' and 'search fields'. Although our review is extensive, it is possible that we missed some insightful perspectives on WIFF presented in research domains other than the WoS.This work has the following research limitations.

        <p>The WIFF field has been opening up for the last decade, leading to many research topics and little agreement on the theoretical and methodological orientations to follow. In this context, this review aims to better understand and assess the WIFF research by analysing its evolution, trends and gaps to develop a comprehensive framework that can guide future research. The field focuses mainly on women's entry into the family firm, either because they start or run their own business or are successors in the business, women's involvement and dynamics in family and business spheres, and family firms and family status at different times and in different socio-cultural and economic environments and their influence on the WIFF. Studies on female entrepreneurship show that participation rates of women are generally markedly lower than those of men in most countries, and the levels of entrepreneurial and leadership activities by women in family firms are also lower. However, generalizing the findings to multiple contexts-traditional and non-traditional sectors for women-is difficult and there is also a strong bias towards single-country studies, with limited studies in developing and transitional economies.The WIFF field has been opening up for the last decade, leading to many research topics and little agreement on the theoretical and methodological orientations to follow.

        <p>Given the global prevalence of family firms, this study suggests that the better we understand the factors that both encourage and deter or prevent women from starting or joining a family business, the better women can be supported by policy and practice. The more we appreciate the external and internal influences on women's decisions and subsequent experiences, the better placed we will be to understand the theoretical perspectives and models that frame different ways of thinking about family firms. By understanding the impact of these internal and external factors, academics could engage with policymakers to develop the policies and practices that help shape entrepreneurial actions and behaviour, and appreciate the areas where gender-based aspects might result in different outcomes.Given the global prevalence of family firms, this study suggests that the better we understand the factors that both encourage and deter or prevent women from starting or joining a family business, the better women can be supported by policy and practice.

        <p>Determining the association between gender literature and family-business literature is a difficult task involving both conceptual and methodological challenges. Our review reveals little systematic usage of theories that underpin the WIFF research-mainly agency, RBV, resource dependence, social capital and identity theories. Moreover, not all studies have used theoretical and methodological approaches to underpin their conclusions. Since a single theory might not always provide an adequate explanation of the phenomenon and the reality might be quite complex, different approaches should be used in the future. Therefore, we advocate the incorporation of theoretical approaches from psychology, family science and SEW as well as mixed methods and longitudinal data to fully explore the WIFF field, given its multidisciplinary nature. This could help formulate new RQs that support the development of this promising field of research. Our review is intended to encourage further WIFF research and to encourage researchers to gain deeper knowledge of this field.Determining the association between gender literature and family-business literature is a difficult task involving both conceptual and methodological challenges.
