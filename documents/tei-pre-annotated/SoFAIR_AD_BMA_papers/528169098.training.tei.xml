        <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected many industries since the beginning of 2020 due to limited human mobility and travel restrictions imposed by many countries (WHO, 2020). As a result, the tourism and hospitality industry has experienced an immediate negative impact during the pandemic, and many tourist attractions and hotels have shut down because domestic and international travel has been suspended (Baum &amp; Hai, 2020). The American Hotel and Lodging Association (2020) projected this year (i.e., 2020) to be the worst on record for the hotel industry, with negative repercussions for labor demand. Hotel owners are being forced to consider or even implement layoffs and furloughs (Cox, 2020), creating uncertainty for hotel employees with regard to their earnings, job status, and even career development. Consequently, the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to major challenges in staff recruitment and employee retention for hotel managers (Filimonau, Derqui, &amp; Matute, 2020).Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected many industries since the beginning of 2020 due to limited human mobility and travel restrictions imposed by many countries (WHO, 2020).

        <p>Faced with these challenges, hotels are helping their employees survive by establishing relief funds, offering alternative work arrangements, and providing education and training programs (Fox, 2020). Many organizations believe that increasing career adaptability through education and training can help them cope with workplace challenges during this difficult time (Rasheed, Okumus, Weng, Hameed, &amp; Nawaz, 2020). Heath (2020) stated that career adaptability could help individuals see the possibilities in unanticipated changes, capitalize on those changes, and recover from unforeseeable outcomes. Proactive personality is another important trait of employees who work in hospitality management (Yang, Chen, Zhao, &amp; Hua, 2020). Researchers have found that proactive employees are likely to be well prepared for career-related changes (Tolentino, Garcia, Lu, Restubog, Bordia, &amp; Plewa, 2014), and proactive personality is a critical factor affecting the formation of career adaptability (Jiang, 2017;Tolentino et al., 2014). While increased career adaptability is generally perceived as a positive characteristic, it is not always beneficial to employers. On one hand, career adaptability is associated with positive outcomes, such as higher job satisfaction (e.g., Chan, Mai, Kuok, &amp; Kong, 2016;Guan, Zhou, Ye, Jiang, &amp; Zhou, 2015), and consequently, lower turnover intentions (e.g., Rasheed et al., 2020); on the other hand, career adaptability can be a double-edged sword and may lead to higher voluntary turnover intentions (e.g., Ito &amp; Brotheridge, 2005;Karatepe &amp; Olugbade, 2017). To date, it is still unclear how career adaptability impacts intentions.Faced with these challenges, hotels are helping their employees survive by establishing relief funds, offering alternative work arrangements, and providing education and training programs (Fox, 2020).

        <p>Considering the major impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hotel labor market, highly adaptable employees may indeed seek opportunities outside their current companies. In other words, highly adaptable individuals may be less dependent on their current employers and exhibit higher turnover intentions. Such an argument can be especially relevant during the pandemic because of the uncertainty surrounding their jobs. Addressing this research gap is critically important, given its increased salience during the pandemic. While hotel managers may cope with pandemic-related challenges, they also need assurances that those efforts and investments will not inadvertently lead to higher turnover rates.Considering the major impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hotel labor market, highly adaptable employees may indeed seek opportunities outside their current companies.

        <p>To reconcile the mixed findings in the literature, we propose a model that accounts for the moderating role of work social support (i.e., supervisor support and coworker support) in the relationship between career adaptability and turnover intentions. From a social exchange theory perspective, employees make commitments to their employers in exchange for support in the workplace (Eisenberger, Fasolo, &amp; Davis-LaMastro, 1990), which results in mutually rewarding relationships (Cropanzano &amp; Mitchell, 2005). Social exchange theory can be a helpful lens for analyzing relationships among career adaptability, work social support, and turnover intentions (Eisenberger, Huntington, Hutchison, &amp; Sowa, 1986). When employees receive strong work social support, they are more committed to the organization and consequently are more likely to be adaptable within the company. On the contrary, when employees receive weak work social support, they feel less obligated to stay with their current employer. Those highly adaptable employees may seek opportunities outside the company, resulting in higher voluntary turnover.To reconcile the mixed findings in the literature, we propose a model that accounts for the moderating role of work social support (i.e., supervisor support and coworker support) in the relationship between career adaptability and turnover intentions.

        <p>In sum, we aim to examine (a) the impact of proactive personality on career adaptability, and (b) the moderating role of work social support on the relationship between career adaptability and turnover intentions. Findings from this study will not only contribute to the career adaptability literature in the hospitality field, but also will help hotel managers retain valuable talent in the future after the world recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.In sum, we aim to examine (a) the impact of proactive personality on career adaptability, and (b) the moderating role of work social support on the relationship between career adaptability and turnover intentions.

        <p>Career adaptability is described as a psychological resource that enables individuals to handle challenges in their careers (Savickas,1997). According to career construction theory, individuals with higher career adaptability possess more significant transactional competencies and more psychosocial resources that enable them to adapt to and successfully deal with tasks, transitions, and traumas in their careers (Savickas, 1997). The model associated with this theory and addresses social expectations and how the individual handles subsequent career transitions (Savickas et al., 2009). Savickas (2005) later and resources for coping with current and imminent vocational development tasks, occupational competencies, and attitudes that make individuals better suited to particular jobs (Tolentino, Garcia, Restubog, Bordia, &amp; Tang, 2013).Career adaptability is described as a psychological resource that enables individuals to handle challenges in their careers (Savickas,1997).

        <p>Career adaptability can be triggered or developed during career-related events or changes (Ocampo, Reyes, Chen, Restubog, Chih, Chua-Garcia, &amp; Guan, 2020). It can also be fostered by different high-performance work practices such as formal employee training, high pay levels, and group-based performance pay (Safavi &amp; Karatepe, 2018). On one hand, individuals can increase their own career adaptability to strengthen their capacity to handle occupational changes (Savickas &amp; Porfeli, 2012); on the other hand, managers can help employees increase their career adaptability to enhance their fit with the workplace and effectively manage career changes and challenges (Zacher, Ambiel, &amp; Noronha, 2015). The resources of adaptability (also called adapt-abilities are concern, control, curiosity, and confidence (Savickas, 2005). Concern involves planning for the future, control implies a personal responsibility to shape the future, curiosity leads to exploring possible roles, and confidence is belief goals and implement choices (Savickas &amp; Porfeli, 2012).Career adaptability can be triggered or developed during career-related events or changes (Ocampo, Reyes, Chen, Restubog, Chih, Chua-Garcia, &amp; Guan, 2020).

        <p>Extant literature has shown that career adaptability is positively related to career success, job performance (Yu &amp; Zheng, 2013), and employee well-being (Ohme &amp; Zacher, 2015). It has also been established as a significant predictor of various positive career outcomes, including promotability (Tolentino et al., 2013), employment status (Guan et al., 2014), career satisfaction (Zacher, 2014), successful career transitions and career counseling (Brown, Bimrose, Barnes, &amp; Hughes, 2012), reduced career anxiety and work stress (Maggiori, Johnston, Krings, Massoudi, &amp; Rossier, 2013), and higher job satisfaction and work engagement (Rossier, Zecca, Stauffer, Maggiori, &amp; Dauwalder, 2012).Extant literature has shown that career adaptability is positively related to career success, job performance (Yu &amp; Zheng, 2013), and employee well-being (Ohme &amp; Zacher, 2015).

        <p>Consequently, career adaptability can be especially vital in a crisis. During a global crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic, career adaptability can be perceived as an important skill in the workplace, as significant economic changes drive involuntary job changes, layoffs, and furloughs. Career adaptability may help individuals see the possibilities in unanticipated changes, capitalize on those changes, and recover from unforeseeable outcomes (Rudolph, Lavigne, &amp; Zacher, 2017). It may also help people respond to changes in a calm and composed manner (Tripathy, 2020) and stimulate more possibilities in a complicated situation (Ginevra et al., 2018).Consequently, career adaptability can be especially vital in a crisis.

        <p>However, while career adaptability tends to help employees cope with challenges during difficult times, it is not clear whether employees with high career adaptability would work to find solutions within their current companies or seek employment opportunities elsewhere. Findings in the extant literature are mixed. To date, it is unclear how career adaptability would impact voluntary turnover intentions. In addition, although past research has explored the consequences of career adaptability, relatively scant attention has been paid to the antecedents of this construct (Ramos &amp; Lopez, 2018). Therefore, we also examine proactive personality as an important antecedent of career adaptability. In the following sections, we introduce proactive personality as an antecedent of career adaptability before elaborating the moderating role of work social support in the relationship between career adaptability and turnover intentions. Based on these insights, we propose a moderated mediation model among proactive personality, career adaptability, and turnover intentions.However, while career adaptability tends to help employees cope with challenges during difficult times, it is not clear whether employees with high career adaptability would work to find solutions within their current companies or seek employment opportunities elsewhere.

        <p>Researchers have examined stable personality traits as predictors of career adaptability in a number of studies. For example, Rudolph et al. (2017) performed a meta-analysis and found that all the Big Five personality traits predict career adaptability. In particular, two traits, conscientiousness and openness, are the strongest predictors of career adaptability (Zacher, 2016). This means that individuals who score higher on these traits are better able to adapt and cope with career challenges (Storme, Celik, &amp; Myszkowski, 2020). Other traits or characteristics that have been found to predict career adaptability include self-esteem and regulatory focus (van Vianen, Klehe, Koen, &amp; Dries, 2012), emotional intelligence (Celik &amp; Storme, 2018), core selfevaluations (Zacher, 2014), and future orientation (Rudolph et al., 2017).Researchers have examined stable personality traits as predictors of career adaptability in a number of studies.

        <p>In the current research, we examine proactive personality -a relatively stable characteristic driving people to act on initiatives to impact their circumstances (Bateman &amp; Crant, 1993;Jiang, 2017) -as an antecedent of career adaptability. Extant literature has found that proactive personality explains unique variance in criteria over and above that accounted for , Tims, &amp; Derks, 2012, p. 1360). In the hospitality industry, proactive personality is a particularly important personality trait for employees, because those who are proactive take personal initiative in various circumstances, which enables them to rapidly adapt to customer ever-changing needs and deliver high-quality service (Yang et al., 2020).In the current research, we examine proactive personality -a relatively stable characteristic driving people to act on initiatives to impact their circumstances (Bateman &amp; Crant, 1993;Jiang, 2017) -as an antecedent of career adaptability.

        <p>Consistent with personal agency in career construction theory (Del Corso &amp; Rehfuss, 2011), the proactive perspective argues that proactive individuals can successfully improve situations to better suit their needs and preferences. As a result, those with more proactive personalities are better prepared to handle career tasks and transitions than those with less proactive personalities (Jiang, 2017). Prior research has also demonstrated that proactive workers are intrinsically motivated to actively improve the constrained environment via positive coping strategies (Zhao &amp; Guo, 2019). Thus, individuals who are more proactive, open to change, and flexible tend to manage their careers more effectively than those who are more passive recipients of environmental constraints. Therefore, we anticipate that proactive employees are able to be responsive, and to actively shape the work environment and develop career adaptability resources.

        <p>Findings in the extant literature are mixed regarding the relationship between career adaptability and turnover intentions. Some studies suggest a positive association between career adaptability and turnover intentions (e.g., Ito &amp; Brotheridge, 2005;Karatepe &amp; Olugbade, 2017) whereas others reveal a negative relationship between the two (e.g., Zhu, Cai, Buchtel, &amp; Guan, 2019). For example, some scholars argue that career adaptability enables employees to adapt well to the changing work environment, which then leads to a positive attitude toward their careers within their organizations (Chan &amp; Mai, 2015;Omar &amp; Noordin, 2013). This positive attitude further enhances their willingness to maintain good relationships with their supervisors and coworkers. Therefore, employees with high career adaptability may be more likely to stay within their organizations (Savickas &amp; Porfeli, 2012).Findings in the extant literature are mixed regarding the relationship between career adaptability and turnover intentions. Some studies suggest a positive association between career adaptability and turnover intentions (e.g., Ito &amp; Brotheridge, 2005;Karatepe &amp; Olugbade, 2017) whereas others reveal a negative relationship between the two (e.g., Zhu, Cai, Buchtel, &amp; Guan, 2019).

        <p>In contrast, other studies reveal that employees with high career adaptability tend to have higher intentions to leave their current companies (Ito &amp; Brotheridge, 2005;Yu &amp; Zheng, 2013). Roehling, Cavanaugh, Moynihan, and Boswell (2000) argued that security from career adaptability does not stay between employee and employer but rather in the adapt to change and even take advantage of other opportunities. Strong career adaptability not only makes employees more qualified for employment opportunities in other organizations, but also increases mobility and the willingness to take advantage of such opportunities (Ito &amp; Brotheridge, 2005), which may increase voluntary turnover (Stroh, Brett, &amp; Reilly, 1996). Guan et al. (2014) re-emphasized that employees with high levels of career adaptability are more open to potential career changes, which mirrors findings showing that those with high career adaptability are also highly aware of alternate career options (Savickas, 2013;Savickas &amp; Porfeli, 2012). Furthermore, a high level of career adaptability may enable employees to put forth the effort necessary to scan for possible career options (Zacher et al., 2015).In contrast, other studies reveal that employees with high career adaptability tend to have higher intentions to leave their current companies (Ito &amp; Brotheridge, 2005;Yu &amp; Zheng, 2013).

        <p>In fact, when employees strengthen their career adaptability, they enhance their employability, not only within, but also outside their organizations (Waterman, Waterman, &amp; Collard, 1994). Therefore, career adaptability may lead to increased employee turnover because they feel that they are more qualified and actively seek employment opportunities in other organizations (Ito &amp; Brotheridge, 2005). In other words, whereas career adaptability may reduce risks for employees, it may increase risk knowledge, skills, and abilities. Although career adaptability is an important skill to help employees adapt and facilitate future career development (e.g., Hou, Leung, Li, Li, &amp; Xu, 2012), the relationship between career adaptability and turnover intentions is rather inconclusive. In examining whether highly adaptive employees tend to stay in their current organizations during the pandemic or actively seek outside opportunities to advance their careers, we consider the moderating role of work social support.In fact, when employees strengthen their career adaptability, they enhance their employability, not only within, but also outside their organizations (Waterman, Waterman, &amp; Collard, 1994).

        <p>Social exchange theory (SET) is one the most influential concepts in organizational behavior (Cropanzano &amp; Mitchell, 2005). According to Emerson (1976), social exchange involves interactions that create obligations. Such interactions are interdependent on the actions of another party (Blau, 1964), and have the potential to generate a high-quality relationship (Cropanzano &amp; Mitchell, 2005). Social exchange includes actions contingent on the rewarding reactions of others, which over time establish mutually rewarding relationships (Cropanzano &amp; Mitchell, 2005).Social exchange theory (SET) is one the most influential concepts in organizational behavior (Cropanzano &amp; Mitchell, 2005).

        <p>In the workplace, social exchange involves employees exchanging their commitment for et al., 1986, 1990). For example, Wayne, Shore, and Liden (1997) found that organizations play commitment through perceptions of organizational support by providing resources that enable proactive career development, such as training and development programs and challenging job assignments that foster feelings of personal growth. According to SET, the decision to leave the company is affected by relational inducements such as a lack of work-related support from an organization, supervisor, and coworkers (Maertz, Griffeth, Campbell, &amp; Allen, 2007). Employees are less likely to consider leaving when they feel that their work efforts are being supported by their organizations or their supervisors (Dawley, Andrews, &amp; Bucklew, 2008). SET thereby provides a rationale for examining the moderating role of work social support between career adaptability and turnover intentions (Eisenberger et al., 1986;Whitener &amp; Walz, 1993).In the workplace, social exchange involves employees exchanging their commitment for et al., 1986, 1990).

Both supervisors and coworkers provide support in the form of formal and informal feedback on task performance as well as encouragement regarding career development (Peng &amp; Zeng, 2017). Such support can help employees meet their career goals, achieve continuous advancement, and become valued members of the company. As a result, with strong supervisor support and coworker support, employees with high career adaptability should be more likely to stay in their current organizations to cope with challenges and further advance their careers (Zhu et al., 2019).On one hand, career adaptability may lead to lower turnover intentions (e.g., Chan et al., 2016;Guan et al., 2015); on the other hand, more adaptable employees may be less dependent on Supervisors and coworkers are important actors who can build strong emotional and social bonds with employees.

Taken together, we propose that the influence of career adaptability on turnover intentions depends on work social support, which includes both supervisor and coworker support.On the contrary, when employees have lower perceptions of supervisor and coworker support, they may experience lower levels of affective commitment and feel less obligated to stay within their current organizations (Maertz et al., 2007).

This moderation effect is graphically depicted in Figure 3, such that when coworker support is low, employees with high career adaptability have higher turnover intentions than those with low career adaptability. On the contrary, when coworker support is high, employees with high career adaptability have lower turnover intentions than those with low career adaptability.*Please insert Table 4 here* Another PROCESS model was tested using the same variables, but replacing the moderator with coworker support to test H2b, H3b and H4b. H2b and H3b predict that coworker support moderates the relationship between career adaptability and turnover intentions. The predicted interaction between coworker support and career adaptability is statistically significant (b = -0.44, p &lt; 0.001). These results are summarized in Table 5.

        <p>Career adaptability is a relatively new concept which merits attention from hospitality scholars (Rasheed et al., 2020). Our study enriches the literature of career adaptability in hospitality management by revealing a conditional effect of work social support on the relationship between career adaptability and turnover intentions. The current research represents an important attempt to direct the attention of researchers to this phenomenon in the hospitality industry, a dynamic context in which already high levels of employee turnover have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, many hotels ask employees to be furloughed or on unpaid leave, which is a short-term solution financially speaking. During unpaid leave or furlough, it is possible that some employees may leave their companies and look for other opportunities. However, when the industry business is back on track, it will be expensive to recruit and hire again. The current study suggests that highly adaptable employees may indeed exhibit higher turnover intentions and seek opportunities outside their current daptability with substantial work social support is vital to retain talents during this difficult time. According to social exchange theory, the decision to leave the company is affected by relational inducements, such as a lack of work-related support (Maertz et al., 2007). Employees, no matter if they are still working in the companies, having furloughed, or having unpaid leave, are less likely to consider leaving when they feel that their work efforts are being supported by their organizations or supervisors (Dawley et al., 2008).Career adaptability is a relatively new concept which merits attention from hospitality scholars (Rasheed et al., 2020).

        <p>In particular, our study reveals supervisor and coworker support as key boundary conditions affecting the relationship between career adaptability and turnover intentions. Our findings suggest that the higher employee career adaptability, the lower their intentions to leave when they perceive high supervisor and coworker support. In contrast, although career adaptability increases psychological resources, which enables employees to advance their careers within their current companies (Rasheed et al., 2020), the findings reveal that high levels of career adaptability do not mitigate employee intentions to quit if employees perceive little support in the workplace. Thus, our study has identified work social support as an important moderator regarding when employee career adaptability supports or undermines employee retention. The results highlight the critical roles of supervisor and coworker support in the literature, complementing SET (Cropanzano &amp; Mitchell, 2005). The positive impact of employee career adaptability on their turnover intentions when they perceive lower supervisor and coworker support is an important finding which has implications for future research and applications.In particular, our study reveals supervisor and coworker support as key boundary conditions affecting the relationship between career adaptability and turnover intentions.

        <p>We not only examined the relationship between career adaptability and turnover intentions through supervisor and coworker support, but also investigated proactive personality as an important predictor of career adaptability in this theoretical model. Although a review of the literature suggests that researchers have explored the consequences of career adaptability, relatively scant attention has been paid to the antecedents of career adaptability (Ramos &amp; Lopez, 2018). This research has answered this call by identifying personality as an important antecedent. This result is aligned with the assumption of career construction theory that employee proactive personality is anchored in self-regulation capacities to respond and adapt to life and work situations successfully (Tolentino et al., 2013). The current research answers the question of how employee proactive personality predicts career adaptability, which in turn is related to turnover intentions via the moderating effect of work social support in the forms of supervisor and coworker support. Because career adaptability helps frontline workers adapt to the rapidly changing hospitality environment, and given the value of career adaptability to frontline workers (Safavi &amp; Bouzari, 2019), it is expected that the findings could be generalized to other service sectors such as restaurants and theme parks facing similar issues.We not only examined the relationship between career adaptability and turnover intentions through supervisor and coworker support, but also investigated proactive personality as an important predictor of career adaptability in this theoretical model.

        <p>Findings from this study also have several valuable managerial implications that may help hotel managers identify opportunities to (Savickas, 2005(Savickas, , 2013)). Organizations also can provide staff with self-development resources such as tuition reimbursement programs and opportunities for learning, training, and crossexposure to other properties within the hotel chain, which may increase career adaptability and their commitment to the organization. In addition, managers may consider using career adaptability as a selection criterion in recruitment in the post-pandemic era to identify high-potential candidates in their companies. With a highly adaptable workforce, training and job rotation programs can be an effective way to enhance employees career adaptability (Guan, Yang, Zhou, Tian, &amp; Eves, 2016).Findings from this study also have several valuable managerial implications that may help hotel managers identify opportunities to (Savickas, 2005(Savickas, , 2013)).

        <p>More importantly, when helping employees enhance career adaptability, it is vital to provide strong work social support to avoid triggering higher turnover intentions. The current study reveals the important role of strong supervisor support and coworker support in retaining highly adaptable employees. In general, supervisor support consists of offering helpful feedback about work performance, keeping subordinates informed about career opportunities, mentoring, and supporting attempts to acquire additional training or education to advance their careers. More specifically, during a crisis, supervisors and managers need to provide career support in order to recoup investments in developing the knowledge, skills, and abilities of their subordinates s to leave (Ito &amp; Brotheridge, 2005). It is also important for hotels to train their managers and supervisors to be capable, available, and resourceful to support their staff. Such training is needed to strengthen awareness and help managers and supervisors develop the skills necessary to offer potential remedies and support to employees in accordance with the policies of the company and relevant authorities.More importantly, when helping employees enhance career adaptability, it is vital to provide strong work social support to avoid triggering higher turnover intentions.

        <p>Managers and supervisors should also strive to address the personal needs of employees, especially those who are still working. Furthermore, organizational leaders who can identify and address employees interpersonal needs can be powerful catalysts in promoting work social support (Singh, Shaffer, Selvarajan, 2018). Division heads should show compassion and trustworthiness and implement real-time measures of support f during this difficult time (Ahmed, Zhao, &amp; Faraz, 2020). Employers can also promote supervisor support via social networking technology by establishing a platform where employees can discuss and manage their issues or problems, which in turn, organizations can enhance a supportive work environment that supports their career goals and emotional wellbeing (Papagiannidis, &amp; Marikyan, 2020).Managers and supervisors should also strive to address the personal needs of employees, especially those who are still working.

        <p>Beyond strengthening supervisor support in the workplace, it is essential for coworkers to provide strong work social support during difficult times. Managers may encourage informal social relationships among employees in the organization to facilitate positive interactions.Beyond strengthening supervisor support in the workplace, it is essential for coworkers to provide strong work social support during difficult times.

        <p>Holding orientation sessions for employees who hold similar positions both within and across departments may reinforce bonding among coworkers. Furthermore, it is necessary to reestablish connections amongst members of the workforce who are furloughed, laid off, or on unpaid leave. By maintaining relationships among coworkers, employees can strengthen their connections within the organization and reinforce their sense of worth. It is critically important for employers to establish a friendly workplace climate (including friendship opportunities and friendship prevalence) for their employees (Zhuang, Chen, Chang, Guan, &amp; Huan, 2020).Holding orientation sessions for employees who hold similar positions both within and across departments may reinforce bonding among coworkers.

        <p>Fostering positive and professional relationships within departments is an important way to demonstrate coworker support. Regular Zoom meetings, group chats, or any forms of interactive communication, such as creating social media groups for staff members to post and share their daily activities, are recommended (Schinoff, Ashforth, &amp; Corley, 2020).Fostering positive and professional relationships within departments is an important way to demonstrate coworker support.

        <p>As with all research, it is important to acknowledge several limitations of this study which may provide potential avenues for further research. First, because the pandemic is behaviors. A longitudinal study could be conducted to capture actual turnover behaviors after the pandemic. Second, although we proposed a moderated mediation model and examined the moderating roles of both supervisor and coworker support, we did not perform a fine-grained analysis that considered , such as the nature of their jobs (front of the house vs. back of the house, line level vs. managerial positions). In future studies, researchers could consider collecting data on . It is possible that the impact of supervisor vs. coworker support may vary across different departments and positions.As with all research, it is important to acknowledge several limitations of this study which may provide potential avenues for further research.

        <p>Furthermore, additional research on career adaptability is warranted. In this study, we investigated one predictor, proactive personality, and how this links to turnover intentions through the moderating role of workplace support. Future studies are needed to identify other antecedents and outcomes of career adaptability.

        <p>Lastly, we focused only on the hotel industry in the current study. Other sectors of the hospitality and tourism industry such as restaurants and theme parks may have different work structures and generate different results regarding supervisor/coworker support.
