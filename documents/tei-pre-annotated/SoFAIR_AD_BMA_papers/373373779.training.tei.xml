        <p>Sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) has grown significantly and has become a subject of increased concern due to environmental resource limitations, a global population explosion, the corruption of logistics production and consumption activities, and waste and pollution increases (Rebs et al., 2019). Over the last decade, academics and practitioners have endeavored to expand the frontier of sustainable development into supply chain management (SCM) to investigate SSCM (Bui et al., 2021;Tseng et al., 2016;Tseng and Chiu, 2013). The progression of exploration into sustainability has resulted in an increased emphasis on understanding various aspects of the sustainable supply chain (Brandenburg et al., 2014;Hu et al., 2020;Rajeev et al., 2017). As a result, the literal concept of SSCM is wide-ranging and varied and needs to be explored as a whole together with different viewpoints (Ansari and Kant, 2017). Integrated perception approaches are required to address firms' internal operations along with their external upstream and downstream operations while also considering the potential diverging opinions regarding the overall benefits.Sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) has grown significantly and has become a subject of increased concern due to environmental resource limitations, a global population explosion, the corruption of logistics production and consumption activities, and waste and pollution increases (Rebs et al., 2019).

        <p>The literatures have presented summaries of the SSCM evolution across different aspects (Rajeev et al., 2019;Tseng et al., 2019;Mohammed et al., 2020). For Instance, Gómez-Luciano et al. (2018) linked supply markets and globalization based on the theoretical foundation of SSCM and the related literature. Ciccullo et al. (2018) addressed the integration of the lean, agile and SSCM paradigms with sustainable environmental and social dimensions. Bastas and Liyanage (2018) adopted an interorganizational view to study the state of the art of sustainable supply chain quality management. Meherishi et al. (2019) provided a better understanding of sustainable packaging in SCM in the circular economy through a systematic approach. Wang et al. (2019) categorized the research on precast SCM for off-site construction. Rajeev et al. (2019) delineated the SSCM trends across theoretical angles over various stages of economic growth. Prior studies have yet to distinguish different parts of the supply chain as independent entities, treating them instead with conventional imprecise consideration (Govindan et al., 2020;Ni and Sun, 2019). A comprehensive integrated assessment of SSCM is still absent in the extant literature, making it necessary to identify potential opportunities for new study directions (Ansari and Kant, 2017;Farooque et al., 2019). This study proposes a data-driven analysis to illustrate a clear overall concept of SSCM and reveals factors hindering improvement of the field.The literatures have presented summaries of the SSCM evolution across different aspects (Rajeev et al., 2019;Tseng et al., 2019;Mohammed et al., 2020).

        <p>SSCM helps to link development and environmental issues and drives political and economic change locally, nationally and globally (Bui et al. 2020b; Mangla et al., 2017). Sustainable practices must focus on local social development and interconnected environmental issues as well as on global economic consequences (Bendul et al., 2017;Tan et al., 2016). Grimm et al. (2014) and Wu and Pullman (2015) argued that environmental and social corollaries regularly depend on the production site and cultural elements, causing prospects to deviate among supply chain partners. Ciccullo et al. (2018) claimed that the geographical concentration of the supply base improves operational performance due to integration within the sustainable supply chain paradigm. Firms may lack prominence in the supply base beyond the primary tier of their supply chain partner; others may view them as sites where environmental and existing execution is uncertain. The supply chain is characterized as complicated, composed of different players, and detached across various levels and different geographies; thus, the distinction between different areas poses serious challenges to sustainability (Carter et al., 2015;Koberg and Longoni, 2018). An emphasis on setting aside an overall viewpoint to explore the regional phenomena of state-of-the-art SSCM is necessary.

        <p>This study contributes to identifying the boundary of fundamental SSCM knowledge to advance future studies and support practical execution. Valuable direction is provided by the existing data-driven literature and identifying the critical indicators needed for further examination. The challenges and gaps among different geographical regions are addressed not only to provide a local standpoint for advanced assessment but also to comprehensively capture the global SSCM state-of-the-art. Since the supply chain environment has suffered uncertainties due to the urgent need to endorse sustainable development and create competitive advantages (Tseng et al, 2019, Liu et al., 2019a). This study employs both quantitative and qualitative approaches. A hybrid approach combining data-driven analysis, the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM), the entropy weight method (EWM) and the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (FDEMATEL) is adopted due to the uncertainty and complexity of SSCM. The 
            <rs type="software">VOSviewer</rs> is applied to identify the SSCM indicators based on the big data in the Scopus database (Shukla et al., 2019). The FDM is used to refine the valid indicators by computing their perception levels from experts' linguistic references (Bui et al., 2021;Tsai et al., 2020;Tseng and Bui, 2017). The EWM is to convert the indicator occurrence information into comparable weights to determine the indicators' performance among regions; and the FDEMATEL identifies the perceptions through linguistic preferences and the important indicators that require urgent attention in future research to improve SSCM (Tseng, 2017;Tseng et al., 2018a).

        <p>This section presents the related literature on SSCM from a regional perspective. Seuring and Muller (2008) defined SSCM as managing the flow of materials, information and capital as well as cooperation and collaboration among firms within the supply chain while adopting all the sustainable development goals entailed by the economic, environmental, and social aspects (the triple bottom line; TBL) expectations of stakeholders and customers. Carter and Rogers (2008) describe SSCM as the strategic, transparent, and complete integration of the TBL in the systematic coordination of business processes to improve the long-term relationship between organizations and their supply chain. Ahi and Searcy (2015) defined SSCM as the design of coordinated supply chains including voluntary TBL integration to effectively and efficiently manage product or service acquisition, manufacture, and distribution to meet the requirements of stakeholders and improve the organization's profitability, resilience, and competitiveness in the short and long term.This section presents the related literature on SSCM from a regional perspective.

        <p>Many classifications have been proposed. Türkay et al. (2016) proposed integrating dimensions of sustainability in supply chain design and organization to comprehensively assess supply chain sustainability strategies. Franco (2017) identified the challenges faced by supply chain participants from product design to the recovery and reprocessing of products in circular production. Golev and Corder (2017) performed an in-depth examination of the sustainable supply chain associated with e-waste management in the production chain. Liu et al. (2018) highlighted the significance of collaboration with different third parties at distinct stages of supplier resourcefulness. The external and internal sustainable supply chain perspectives are considered related viewpoints in which tensions arising from inequitably distributed benefits are apparent (Rebs et al., 2018). The SSCM literature reiterates that information flow, collaboration, coordination, and connectivity across the supply chain network are key to achieving a higher level of organizational and supply chain sustainability performance (Liebetruth, 2017;Rajeev et al., 2017;Reefke and Sundaram, 2016). Few contributions cover both environmental and social influences, since focusing on the economic scope is part of the conventional supply chain archetype (Feng et al., 2017;Ciccullo et al., 2018).Many classifications have been proposed.

        <p>In this context, environmental supply chains, green supply chains, and closed-loop supply chains have been presented and used interchangeably to extend the integration concepts of SSCM (Gurtu et 2020) established fundamental premises, tendencies and new paths for exploration through a structured systematic review of sustainable supply chain finance motivations, accomplishments and performance. SSCM is essentially the effort to integrate sustainable development into supply chain monitoring. Incorporating sustainability concepts into principal business areas enables the organization to achieve competitive advantages, especially given the dynamics of the global environment (Khodakarami et al., 2015). Although the concept of SSCM has risen to prominence in recent decades in response to growing challenges, the implications are that focusing on progression and competences in the supply chain is not sufficient for an organization to gain an advantageous position in the market (Ansari and Kant, 2017). Firms are facing serious threats to the sustainability of their existing supply chains due to globalization, uncertain demand, challenging markets, and pecuniary effectiveness (Roy et al., 2018). The literature on SSCM has expanded; nevertheless, guidance for scholars and future research opportunities are needed.In this context, environmental supply chains, green supply chains, and closed-loop supply chains have been presented and used interchangeably to extend the integration concepts of SSCM (Gurtu et 2020) established fundamental premises, tendencies and new paths for exploration through a structured systematic review of sustainable supply chain finance motivations, accomplishments and performance.

        <p>SSCM offers opportunities for regions to improve their ecological and social performance as well as their competitiveness and to achieve business goals (McMurray et al., 2014;van Hoof and Thiell, 2015). Silvestre et al. (2018) stated that the supply chain consists of various participants in different geographical regions; for example, manufacturers are usually located in developing countries. Ciccullo et al. (2018) indicated that suppliers' proximity concentrates the geographical supply base, reduces supply lead time, and facilitates suppliers' relationships and deliveries. Mancheri et al. (2019) claimed that the supply chain's complexity and resilience are not reliant on physical disruptions alone but also on dynamic factors such as societal and geopolitical factors. Thus, it is important to confirm that regional issues are one of the key elements influencing global SSCM because they drive global relevance.SSCM offers opportunities for regions to improve their ecological and social performance as well as their competitiveness and to achieve business goals (McMurray et al., 2014;van Hoof and Thiell, 2015).

        <p>Prior studies do not adequately address this specific issue (Fahimnia et 2019) argued that a lack of adequate infrastructure among regions is a major barrier to adopting SSCM practices and expanding business in a context of heavy demand coupled with requests for rapid supply. There is a lack of studies originating regionally as well as discontent among local suppliers who are underrepresented by common business policies and strategies for sustainability (Jia et al., 2018). Hence, this study seeks to fill this gap by proposing a regional comparison in the SSCM context.Prior studies do not adequately address this specific issue (Fahimnia et 2019) argued that a lack of adequate infrastructure among regions is a major barrier to adopting SSCM practices and expanding business in a context of heavy demand coupled with requests for rapid supply.

        <p>Prior studies have identified the components of a big database for building capabilities in the SCM (Akter et al., 2016;Zhan and Tan, 2020). Pereira and Frazzon (2020) proposed a data-driven approach that combines machine-learning petition estimating and operational planning simulation-based optimization for adaptive demand and supply synchronization in retail supply chains. Maroufkhani et al. (2020) used the technological-organizational-environmental model to examine the implementation of data-driven analysis to enhance sustainable solutions for resource and emission reduction among supply chain systems. Majeed et al. (2021) developed a modeling structure by uniting big data analytics, additive manufacturing, and sustainable smart manufacturing technologies, which is advantageous for additive manufacturing initiatives. There is a lack of big data assessments using multi-attribute decision making to enrich SSCM (Tseng et al., 2019). The capacity to refine and validate important indicators for future directions, and the numerical description for data incidences are absent in traditional data-driven analysis (Tsai et al., 2020). Interdependence and interrelationships among attributes and the integration of augmented data-driven solutions into supply chain networks must be addressed to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness (Tseng et al., 2018b).Prior studies have identified the components of a big database for building capabilities in the SCM (Akter et al., 2016;Zhan and Tan, 2020).

        <p>Due to the uncertainty and complexity of SSCM, this study proposed a hybrid multi-attribute decision-making approach including data-driven analysis, fuzzy set theory combined in the FDM, the EWM and the FDEMATEL. The FDM is used to refine and validate the indicators by computing their perceived levels from experts' linguistic references (Tseng and Bui, 2017). The EWM is used to convert the indicator occurrence information into comparable weights to determine the indicators' performance among regions (Tseng, 2017). The FDEMATEL method is used to identify the perceptions through linguistic preferences and the important indicators that require urgent attention in future research to improve SSCM (Tseng et al., 2018a). Still, the fuzzy interpretive structural modelling or analytic network process are more focusing on constructing the hierarchical framework compared to other multi-criteria decision-making technique (Bui et al. 2020b, Tseng et al., 2018a). FDEMATEL is more suitable to indicate the important indicators in the field by addressing the causal inter-relationship between the trends and challenges. Tsai et al. (2020) used a hybrid method, including a data-driven bibliometric analysis, FDM, and EWM to address to future study trend and challenges of municipal solid waste management in a circular economy. Bui et al. (2021) applied a combination of data-driven analysis based on contentbibliometric analyses, FDM, EWM, and FDEMATEL to obtain the experts' evaluation on SSWM towards disruption and organizational ambidexterity. Hence, this study not only provides indepth technique for data-driven analysis, determine the SSWM performance of different regions, but also distinguish the critical indicators as gaps for supplementary knowledge for future studies provisions and practical executions.Due to the uncertainty and complexity of SSCM, this study proposed a hybrid multi-attribute decision-making approach including data-driven analysis, fuzzy set theory combined in the FDM, the EWM and the FDEMATEL.

        <p>The combination of fuzzy set theory and the Delphi method helps decision groups address the lack of expert references and improve questionnaire quality (Ishikawa et al. 1993).

The method has advantages in reducing the quantity of responses and feedback time, providing an effective assessment of experts' judgment and relevant remarks to transform their fuzzy evaluation into exact numbers (Lee et al., 2018).The combination of fuzzy set theory and the Delphi method helps decision groups address the lack of expert references and improve questionnaire quality (Ishikawa et al. 1993).

The FDM process is implemented in 2 rounds in this study. A face-to-face interview with the expert committee is held to refine the SSCM keywords and select the indicators for the FDM analysis. Round 1 aims to eliminate the unnecessary attributes by assimilating expert judgments, and round 2 allows experts to use their knowledge and experience to simplify the complex attribute set from round 1 through discussion (Lee et al., 2018). The process allows group decision making, reducing the number of selections through rapid convergence in predicting sentiments and thereby helping decision makers validate the decision requirement (Bui etThe threshold to refine the valid indicators is calculated using = ∑ ( / ) .

All tracking activities are coded in an equivalent Excel file to prevent repeating the same actions and to improve the results' reliability. A content analysis is used for regional consistency checks of independent coding to count the indicator frequencies for each specific region by searching the SSCM regional data generated from the Scopus database (see Appendix B). For instance, the search term used to generate the regional data for Africa is "TITLE-ABS-KEY ("Cameroon" or "Egypt" or "Ethiopia" or "Ghana" or "Kenya" or "Morocco" or "Nigeria" or "South Africa" or "Tanzania" or "Tunisia" or "Uganda" or "Zimbabwe")". The search terms are used to search the title, abstracts, and keywords. Therefore, studies and authors addressing multiple regions can be avoided, while the geographical issues in the studies' scope are still accounted for.The differences across geographical regions are determined by adopting the entropy weighted method.

The fuzzy membership functions ̃ = ( ̃ , ̃ , ̃ ) are used to compute the total weighted values. Formally, the left and right values are calculated by the minimum and maximum fuzzy numbers. The crisp values are subsequently obtained in the form of a total direct relation matrix that can be used to draw a diagram to simplify the analytical results. The interrelationship structure contains certain indicators that represent important means in the system.

The final FDM indicator set is shown in Table 3. 4 presents the indicator entropy weights for each region. The EWM uses entropy to represent the amount of information. The higher the indicator values are, the more information they contain. In other words, the larger the entropy value is, the smaller the entropy weight (He et al., 2016) and the more information the indicator provides. Hence, this study uses the average weighted technique to determine the level of indicator information in each region. If the weight is greater than the average, the indicator must be improved, shown in Table 5. The results show that Asia and Oceania have the highest amount of information in the field of SSCM, followed by Europe and North America. In contrast, Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean have less information, and there is still much room for SSCM development in these regions.Then, the refined set is used for input in round 2.

        <p>From the FDM indicator set, the experts evaluated the indicator interrelationships using the provided linguistic scales (see Table 2). The fuzzy direct relation matrix and the defuzzification are characterized to compute the average crisp value for all respondents and used to create the initial direction matrix, presented in Table 6.

        <p>Big data has attracted researchers and practitioners' attention in the past few years because of its ability to generate insights in real time that can then be incorporated (Kaur and Singh, 2018). Big data is defined as high volume, high velocity and high variety data that are used in the decision-making process and require innovative techniques to be managed (Beyer and Laney, 2012). The parameters for big data based on inter-intra heterogeneity with the 3Vs-variety, volume and velocity-in which (i) variety considers development sources involving multiple products, periods, suppliers, and carriers; numerous emissions, capacity, cost, and demand issues; and supplier, product, time, and carrier functions; (ii) volume refers to big data storage with the number of suppliers, available carriers, number of products and periods; and (iii) velocity is related to data acquisition and reflects the propensity of data to adjust on a real-time basis, an example being the supplier and carrier capability and product demand fluctuations that occur within each period (Lamba and Singh, 2016). Big data has rapidly grown and extended based on its application and operating procedures in each specific business. Two additional parameters are (iv) value-added with the intention of generating value from cloud computing or the internet of things and (v) veracity regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of the big data analysis used by manufacturing, because the value of big data cannot be scrutinized only by simple statistics (Sandhu and Sood, 2015; Addo-Tenkorang and Helo, 2016; Wang et al, 2016; Wang and Hajli, 2017).Big data has attracted researchers and practitioners' attention in the past few years because of its ability to generate insights in real time that can then be incorporated (Kaur and Singh, 2018).

        <p>Indeed, big data analytics now plays a crucial role in SSCM (Li et al., 2019). It is useful to develop supply chain capability in practice using new technologies, such as data-driven analysis, providing instruments to optimize the data generation process, offering data integration from various foundations, conforming different categories of findings to the business process, and visualizing the data to simplify decision-making (Dubey et al., 2018;Ren et al., 2019, Zhang et al., 2017). Big data influences the supply chain and integrates both upstream and downstream operations to improve the organization's sustainable performance (Singh and El-Kassar, 2019). Therefore, the big data concept contributes to SSCM by building knowledgeable decisions, providing administration and risk mitigation, enhancing operational processes, presenting new products to the market, and scrutinizing the market (Schoenherr and Speier-Pero, 2015). This also has positive impacts on supply chain and operational performance, business values, sustainable procurement, and sustainable manufacturing (Kaur and Singh, 2018;Ren et al., 2019). These help to form an expressive understanding that supports multifaceted SSCM assessments (Gandomi and Haider, 2015;Tsai et al., 2015;Wang et al., 2018).Indeed, big data analytics now plays a crucial role in SSCM (Li et al., 2019).

        <p>In the literature, a social media data analytics technique has been developed for analyzing supply chain and logistics operations (Singh et al., 2018). An environmentally sustainable procurement and logistics model for a supply chain has been proposed that uses big data to assess the variety of real-time boundaries from the purchaser and supplier sides, including lead times, capabilities, costs, and discharge (Kaur and Singh, 2018). SSCM knowledge was explored by determining barriers to big data analytics in manufacturing supply chains (Moktadir et al., 2019a). The role of big data in extending sustainable capabilities was examined as driven by the firm's commitment, the practices of green human resources and SCM to improve sustainability performance (Singh and El-Kassar, 2019). Big data addresses capabilities to handle the problem of carbon emission costs by coordinating a low-carbon supply chain, along with identifying a firm's financial situation by providing advanced technological tools for data management wherein datasets are aggregated in a structured manner (Liu, 2019, Raut et al., 2019). Therefore, the decision-making efficiency and effectiveness of big data must be utilized to offer competitive advantages to firms and to make their supply chain resilient as it approaches SSCM performance.In the literature, a social media data analytics technique has been developed for analyzing supply chain and logistics operations (Singh et al., 2018).

        <p>Failures still exist due to a lack of big data assessment infrastructure and understanding, and other data utilization and implementation issues related to supply chains (Moktadir et al., 2019a). Traditional big data collection, retrieval and evaluation methods are no longer appropriate for the current challenges and opportunities of SSCM and business operations, though they have the potential to renovate business and guarantee organizational response implementation (Hampton et al., 2013;Papadopoulos et al., 2017;Seles et al., 2018;). In SCM, firms are challenged by insufficient resources, time-consuming behavioral issues, return on investment and financial problems, and privacy-security anxieties (Arunachalam et al., 2018). Despite the enormous scope of big data, very few attempts have been made to develop big data applications in SSCM. The fundamental competencies, capabilities, internal mechanisms and processes through which big data formulation may result in better performance strategies have not yet been fully investigated (Singh and El-Kassar, 2019). Most supply chain resolutions have yet to integrate big data features into the decision-making process despite the enormous amount of data generated for both the supplier and buyer sides (Kaur and Singh, 2018). Hence, there is a substantial need to jointly consider big data in SSCM. Because big data are essential in highly uncertain and competitive marketplaces, there is much room for further development and investigation.Failures still exist due to a lack of big data assessment infrastructure and understanding, and other data utilization and implementation issues related to supply chains (Moktadir et al., 2019a).

        <p>Closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs) are studied and implemented because they play a substantial role by taking advantage of recyclable resources and inhibiting waste inflows into the environment (Wang et al, 2018). CLSCs include two fundamental phases: the forward and reverse supply chains (Amin and Zhang, 2012). The forward chain refers to the flow of new products that are delivered from manufacturers to consumers, while the reverse chain is described as the return flow of used, defective, and open box products collected from consumers and transferred to manufacturers or recycling centers (Assarzadegan and Rasti-Barzoki, 2019, Das and Dutta, 2016; Fathollahi-Fard and Hajiaghaei-Keshteli, 2018). The practices include identifying product waste, collecting, separating, packing, storing, recalling, transferring, distributing and recovering value (Mohtashami et al., 2020). The aim is to optimize the product used throughout its entire life cycle by incorporating reverse logistics as a preliminary advanced supply chain from purchase to final sale for used product recovery (Guide and Van Wassenhove, 2009). Hence, an efficient CLSC design may result in reducing the environmental impact in addition to meeting economic and social goals.Closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs) are studied and implemented because they play a substantial role by taking advantage of recyclable resources and inhibiting waste inflows into the environment (Wang et al, 2018).

The aim is to optimize the product used throughout its entire life cycle by incorporating reverse logistics as a preliminary advanced supply chain from purchase to final sale for used product recovery (Guide and Van Wassenhove, 2009). Hence, an efficient CLSC design may result in reducing the environmental impact in addition to meeting economic and social goals.</p>
        <p>The CLSC is essential to creating supplementary logistics infrastructure in terms of synchronizing a robust return supply chain involving steps such as sorting, remanufacturing and allocating to disposal centers (Darbari et al., 2019). Previous studies have addressed different issues related to CLSCs, such as network design, production planning, and inventory management. Two-level reverse logistics were compared between online recycling and traditional recycling to investigate CLSC design and coordination (Feng et al., 2017). A risk and disruption handling model for the CLSC was proposed to minimize costs while identifying facility distribution and quantities for transportation (Jabbarzadeh et al., 2018). A decision model for service, pricing, and third-party recycling in three distinct remanufacturing positions and authorized technology was developed (Zhao et al., 2019). Multiproduct circular supplier selection decision-making and order allocation were assessed considering multiple depots and green routing capacity using heterogeneous vehicles (Govindan et al., 2020). Closed-loop optimal operational planning of supply chains with rapid product quality dynamics was studied, with byproduct quality dynamics and environmental conditions explicitly considered (Lejarza and Baldea, 2020).The CLSC is essential to creating supplementary logistics infrastructure in terms of synchronizing a robust return supply chain involving steps such as sorting, remanufacturing and allocating to disposal centers (Darbari et al., 2019).

        <p>Although the CLSC has been positively assessed, as it recovers returned products' value, ensures that environmental standards are upheld and enhances customer rights, few studies have developed quantitative approaches to adopting a holistic perspective of sustainability (Heydari et al., 2017). Most attention has been directed toward economic perspectives, though considerations have been given to capability positioning decisions and multiple stakeholders themselves (Sahebjamnia et al., 2018). Few scholars have sought to design sustainable networks to solve such problems because of the uncertainty and low demand for remanufactured products (Bouzon et al., 2018;Govindan and Bouzon, 2018;Chouman et al., 2018). In addition, managerial measures, extended manufacturer responsibility systems, regulatory guidance for intellectual property protection, technical and quality standards for recycling systems, and social issues such as consumers' awareness and quality concerns regarding remanufactured products are still under investigation (Rahmaniani et al., 2018;Shi et al., 2019). Because CLSCs are highly important due to their direct impact on political, economic, and environmental problems, accurate and efficient solutions are required.Although the CLSC has been positively assessed, as it recovers returned products' value, ensures that environmental standards are upheld and enhances customer rights, few studies have developed quantitative approaches to adopting a holistic perspective of sustainability (Heydari et al., 2017).

        <p>The concept of industry 4.0 is founded on three principal elements: cyber-physical systems, the internet of things, and smart factories (Hofmann and Rusch, 2017;Tseng et al., 2018b). Industrial evolution is reflected in smart production or integrated manufacturing capabilities, which affect the entire industry in terms of product design, manufacturing and transportation (Hofmann and Rüsch, 2017). Industry 4.0 provides more efficient solutions for monitoring the production system and transforming the manufacturing industry scenario by changing supply chain processes, changing business activities and integrating sustainability to enhance the flexibility of supply chain operations (Bechtsis et al., 2017;de Sousa Jabbour et al., 2018). Industry 4.0 is recognized as a future development in SSCM, with prearranged interrelationships among materials, equipment, and products and sufficient consumer demand in a dynamic situation. Industry 4.0 represents the application of a mixture of digital technology and intelligence to interlocking supply chain networks and enables product customization (Lasi et al., 2014). It can be applied to production lines and can advance a total cyber-corporal system of equipment, machines, and smart infrastructure to achieve superior data interchange and mechanisms using appropriate information technology safety solutions, product maintenance and human skills through professional skill sets and shared information among supply chain partners (Branke et al., 2016). Industry 4.0 considerably changes the approach to SCM (Tjahjono et al., 2017). Its applications beyond a sustainability orientation encompass environmental protection and mechanical advantages as well as advanced safety issues, resource efficiency, human resources, communication, and smarter and flexible measurement in the supply chain (Luthra and Mangla, 2018). Rajput and Singh (2019) found a hidden relationship between the circular economy and industry 4.0 from the two sides of enablers and barriers in the supply chain context. Singh et al. (2019) approached SSCM development through the enhancement of resource utilization and proficiency along with the improvement of the supply chain functions of automated procurement, production, and delivery. There are four significant SSCM paradigms, agile, green, lean, and resilient, to industry 4.0 machines to increase supply chain performance and sustainability (Ramirez-Peña et al., 2019). Different aspects of embedded sustainable supply chains and formulated an outline for evaluating organizational readiness to meet the requirements of the industry 4.0 revolution (Manavalan and Jayakrishna, 2019). An intelligent sustainable supplier selection using multiagent technology for industry 4.0 supply chains to offer advanced communication networks, information exchange structures and transparency among supply chain partners (Ghadimi et al., 2019). Organizational supply chains and sustainability are now forced to adopt industry 4.0 modern technological improvements and promote innovation. These advances provide vast opportunities for industry 4.0 supply chain intelligence and autonomy, creating a critical role for these features in terms of sustainability development (Kamble et al., 2018).The concept of industry 4.0 is founded on three principal elements: cyber-physical systems, the internet of things, and smart factories (Hofmann and Rusch, 2017;Tseng et al., 2018b).

        <p>The concept requires in-depth understanding and empirical practice (Hofmann and Rüsch, 2017). Although the exploratory use of industry 4.0 to identify sustainability in the supply chain has gained considerable attention, it may not yet be fully recognized. Academic and managerial implications are limited and still at an early stage of development (Tseng et al., 2018b). Little effort has been made to incorporate sustainability issues, and the sustainability TBL dimensions (environmental, social, and economic) still lack integration within SSCM for an extended industry 4.0 (Ghadimi et al., 2016;Ghadimi et al., 2019;Wang et al., 2019). Coordination and collaboration problems, security concerns, a lack of governmental support and policies, and the absence of sufficient financial resources to make investments may make it challenging for small-scale industries to implement industry 4.0 (Govindan and Hasanagic, 2018, Pfohl et al. 2017; Manavalan and Jayakrishna, 2019). Additionally, industry 4.0 is difficult to integrate with SSCM due to data quality and credibility problems, unemployment, complexity, reduced human control, and higher negative environmental impacts. Problems with a lack of technological innovation; strategic, ethical, and global policy; the management of supply chain disruptions; facilities planning; and the development of international manufacturing networks remain unsolved (Branke et al., 2016;Pereira et al. 2017;Singh et al., 2019).

        <p>The supply chain is a complicated phenomenon and flexible system affected not only by technical upheaval but also by dynamic and uncertain factors, for example, sociocultural and geopolitical issues such as export bans, unpredictable markets, and environmental regulations (Mancheri et al., 2019). The influence of regulatory legislation on the formation of the SSCM is one of the key tactical elements requiring focused attention (Manavalan and Jayakrishna, 2019). Supply chain policy endorsements aim to control the effects of location, production, inventory and the disposal of products and create a trade-off between transportation, holding costs and profit (Waltho et al., 2018). Supply chain policy is considered to encourage remanufacturing and improved resource efficiency (Zhang et al., 2019a). The policy generally plays an important role in modifying the sustainable development of the whole supply chain, being integrated as a decision-maker to maximize sustainable benefits rather than as a measured constraint on firm profit functions in the effort to synchronize supply chain operations (Liu et al., 2019b).The supply chain is a complicated phenomenon and flexible system affected not only by technical upheaval but also by dynamic and uncertain factors, for example, sociocultural and geopolitical issues such as export bans, unpredictable markets, and environmental regulations (Mancheri et al., 2019).

        <p>An increasing number of researchers have turned their attention to this area of study, as policies have begun to impact SSCM. The influence of government taxes and policy related to environmental protection on the optimum assessment of the supply chain considering government financial involvement has been analyzed (Hafezalkotob, 2015;Hafezalkotob et al., 2016). The effect of three types of government policies on two rival supply chain decision-making processes is under either decentralization or centralization (Zhang and Wang, 2017). Different environmental tax policies in a multi-tiered supply chain network rivalry under stable governing circumstances were captured (Yu and Cruz, 2018). A sustainable supply chain optimization system considering lead time in different production-distribution and inventory scenarios was proposed, with three carbon emission policies: strict carbon capping, carbon cap and trade, and a carbon tax (Manupati et al., 2019). The influence of critical success factors on the development of energyefficient supply chains and their energy policy implications were presented (Moktadir et al., 2019b). A trade credit policy that enriches SSCM under green manufacturing optimization and payment records (Tiwari et al., 2018). The impacts of transfer pricing policies and subsidy policies on CLSCs with retailer and third-party dual collection channels have been analyzed (Wan and Hong, 2019). The optimal inspection policy for customers to encourage responsible sourcing efforts and the relationship of this mechanism to customer awareness was investigated in the context of the supply chain (Zarei et al., 2020).An increasing number of researchers have turned their attention to this area of study, as policies have begun to impact SSCM.

        <p>Nevertheless, the appropriate policy and legislative framework to regulate supply chain actors in the direction of sustainable goals has presented a constant challenge. It was found that some national legislation does not satisfy the objective of environmental protection and violates international policy (Gavin, 2013;Mancheri, 2015;Mancheri et al., 2019). Advancements in carbon emission standards due to rapid industrialization require SCM assessment to avoid compromising social responsibility, environmental performance, and economic mechanisms (Babazadeh et al., 2017;Samadi et al., 2018). Globalization policies have eliminated restrictions on market boundaries, making it hard for small and medium-sized firms to compete with large global organizations, as small firms are incapable of adapting advanced technologies to process new types of materials or of effectively utilizing resources and reducing energy consumption (Thomas and Trentesaux, 2014).Nevertheless, the appropriate policy and legislative framework to regulate supply chain actors in the direction of sustainable goals has presented a constant challenge.

        <p>Although many countries and geographical regions are employing standard environmental mechanisms, including incentives or mandatory targets for firms to reduce their environmental impacts, the advocated interventions still address internal problems in SSCM, such as illegal production, transaction and processing; lack of innovation; congestion; and poor legal and regulatory systems (Yu andCruz, 2018, Zhang andYousaf, 2019). In developing regions, inadequate laws and regulations result in serious social problems, such as manufacturing using child labor, unsustainable performance, and unsanctioned activities, which arise in the early stages of the supply chain (Awaysheh and Klassen, 2010;Silvestre, 2015;Jia et al., 2020). Hence, there are opportunities in the optimization of the number of manufacturers and stowage to integrate sustainability elements, improve supply chain network allocation, and enhance capacity in supply chain facilities and infrastructure, and other solutions present themselves in supplier selection and remanufacturing regulatory systems. The lack of study in this direction hinders the transition to SSCM for both policy makers and their initial stakeholders.Although many countries and geographical regions are employing standard environmental mechanisms, including incentives or mandatory targets for firms to reduce their environmental impacts, the advocated interventions still address internal problems in SSCM, such as illegal production, transaction and processing; lack of innovation; congestion; and poor legal and regulatory systems (Yu andCruz, 2018, Zhang andYousaf, 2019).

        <p>Remanufacturing is defined as a multi-processes that transforms end-of-use products by recovering, checking, disassembling, polishing, renovating, and reassembling to produce a "likenew" product (Govindan et al., 2016;Kafuku et al., 2016). The processes consist of raw material acquisition, reverse delivery, manufacturing procedures, and distribution operations, which ultimately offer large reductions in resource and energy consumption and waste emissions, increased care for the environment, and support for sustainable development (Jiang et al., 2019). Remanufacturing is emphasized as an urgent innovation strategy to slow resource circles. It calls for the integration of design and business system innovations supporting new forms of collaboration, including multiple transactions between suppliers and manufacturers and among manufacturers and buyers and consumers, to comprehend and apply new circular business models combined with new product design considerations (Opresnik and Taisch, 2015). Hence, benefits from remanufacturing implementation could be realized by all business firms, their consumers, the environment, society, and several third parties (Ansari et al., 2019).Remanufacturing is defined as a multi-processes that transforms end-of-use products by recovering, checking, disassembling, polishing, renovating, and reassembling to produce a "likenew" product (Govindan et al., 2016;Kafuku et al., 2016).

        <p>Remanufacturing is an emergent but rapidly developing sector that slows environmental degradation and resource diminution through material reuse and recycling to meet the sustainable goals of SCM (Zhang et al., 2011;Subramoniam et al., 2013;Liu et al., 2017). Case studies in four remanufacturing organizations were conducted to study the influence of implementing lean practices on reducing needless processes and decreasing lead time, thus improving the organizations' operational performance (Kurilova-Palisaitiene et al., 2018). A remanufacturing process that adopts adaptive design was proposed to classify the factors that influence environmental and economic performance (Krystofik et al., 2018). The prioritized performance outcomes obtained via implementing critical success factors in supply chain remanufacturing were investigated (Ansari et al., 2019). Recycling and remanufacturing approaches in the supply chain were explored through the heterogeneous considerations of consumers (Long et al., 2019). An integrated perspective for determining sustainable value creation was investigated in the context of remanufacturing models (Jensen et al., 2019). A supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and retailer was assessed in terms of managing a CLSC with process innovation for remanufacturing (Reimann et al., 2019).

        <p>Although remanufacturing is one of the economic and environmental factors that has received considerable attention, the literature mostly focuses on technology and management, and relatively few studies have evaluated sustainability (Taleizadeh et al., 2017(Taleizadeh et al., , 2019;;Zerang et al., 2018;Shaharudin et al., 2019b). Ensuring the evaluation of remanufacturing sustainability would be helpful for generating insights into resource utilization and environmental safety and should be prioritized by researchers (Zhang et al., 2019b). Gaps remain in the TBL indicator measurements (Jensen et al., 2019). To date, previous studies have only scratched the surface and are limited to exploring each single indicator, and the full picture of the social, environmental and economic problems of remanufacturing has not been fully recognized as an integral part of SSCM (Souza, 2013;Reimann et al., 2019). While the fact that economic concerns are positioned at the forefront of remanufacturing is widely acknowledged, there is little awareness of the possibility of improving remanufacturability to support environmental protection and benefit social wellbeing.Although remanufacturing is one of the economic and environmental factors that has received considerable attention, the literature mostly focuses on technology and management, and relatively few studies have evaluated sustainability (Taleizadeh et al., 2017(Taleizadeh et al., , 2019;;Zerang et al., 2018;Shaharudin et al., 2019b).

        <p>There is still immense recklessness due to the inadequate study and expansion of remanufacturing systems. In reality, the reselling and remarketing of remanufactured products is challenging because consumers may have few incentives to purchase remanufactured products (Xu et al., 2017). Only a few studies integrate both collaboration and competition into remanufacturing optimization systems, which would adjust the functional level and organizational strategies (Rau et al., 2019). The manufacturer may distrust third-party remanufacturers or retailers due to their limited production scope or brand issues while charging them an inconstant or stationary rate (Zhao et al., 2019). Many studies do not consider multilevel construction or discrete changes in value parameters such as pricing or demand patterns, even though these may have long-term negative influences (Hong et al., 2017). Further investigation of remanufacturing supply chain behavior is urgent and requires more attention. In addition, the lack of laws and policies, the evaluation of waste product remanufacturability, energy conservation problems, comparisons of different remanufacturing systems, how to ensure that the quality of new and remanufactured products is the same, and technology licenses have been discussed (Taleizadeh et al., 2019;Zhang et al., 2019b).

        <p>SCND plays a major role in manipulating supply chain operations (Waltho et al, 2018). The concept refers to constructing an effective network for different supply chain entities (Farahani et al., 2014). It represents the facility location problem, and SCM encompasses facility location determination, magnitude, network capabilities and the material flow among the located facilities (Pishvaee and Razmi, 2012). In designing a sustainable supply chain, SCND attempts to delineate the best supply chain alignment to maximize economic profitability, environmental performance, and social performance in the long term (Chaabane et al., 2012). Considering all parts of the system together and inspecting the product flow and information effects through the network are essential to making a supply chain ready for operation (Rodger, 2014). Because the supply chain network is a set of people, activities, and information that interact to convert raw material into useful products and deliver them to the end customer, the SCND covers decisions regarding supplier selection, transportation, production technology, storage capacity, and market demand allocation (Moreno-Camacho et al., 2019). Integration creates more complex problems for the supply chain, with multiple conflicts and contradictory intent in multidimensional decision making (Sherafati et al., 2019).SCND plays a major role in manipulating supply chain operations (Waltho et al, 2018).

In designing a sustainable supply chain, SCND attempts to delineate the best supply chain alignment to maximize economic profitability, environmental performance, and social performance in the long term (Chaabane et al., 2012). Considering all parts of the system together and inspecting the product flow and information effects through the network are essential to making a supply chain ready for operation (Rodger, 2014). Because the supply chain network is a set of people, activities, and information that interact to convert raw material into useful products and deliver them to the end customer, the SCND covers decisions regarding supplier selection, transportation, production technology, storage capacity, and market demand allocation (Moreno-Camacho et al., 2019). Integration creates more complex problems for the supply chain, with multiple conflicts and contradictory intent in multidimensional decision making (Sherafati et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>Recent studies have considered SCND perspectives. An optimization model for SCDN was developed that accounted for financial resources such as trade credit and bank credit (Alavi and Jabbarzadeh, 2018). The SCND problem with the assembly balancing process was analyzed considering a three-layer supply chain including manufacturers, assemblers, and customers that could be decomposed into an upper-level problem and two lower-level problems (Sun and Wang, 2019). A bilevel programming model for hierarchized SCND that thoroughly considers inducements to use cleaner technologies was presented (Chalmardi and Camacho-Vallejo, 2019). Three pillars of sustainability were considered and discussed to design a supply chain network that maximizes turnover while seizing opportunities for social development in less developed regions as a priority (Sherafati et al., 2019). An optimal multi-objective multiproduct supply chain network was designed for efficient and optimal product quantity plans (Mohammed and Duffuaa, 2020).Recent studies have considered SCND perspectives.

        <p>These studies have only considered regional development and concentrated on balancing economic development. Environmental objectives such as pollutant emissions play a significant role but have been ignored in network design problems (Zohal and Soleimani, 2016). The innovative design and planning of supply chain networks needs to give more consideration to all TBL dimensions due to the global sustainable development trend. There should be further investigation into the optimal solution for SCND entities. Increasing competitiveness, a global market and a dynamic environment are required to meet customers' demand while minimizing costs (Sherafati et al., 2019). This sequence has a substantial effect on society and the environment (Manupati, 2019). The uncertainty in SCND could be an interesting topic for future studies. Few studies have developed strong simulations for resolving multi-objective SCND, and reverse logistics and closed-loop supply chain networks are significant issues (Mohammed and Duffuaa, 2020). The development of a model considering facility disruptions will also further SCND. Hence, proposals for sustainable SCND should still be pursued and need to be improved as a future trend in SSCM research.These studies have only considered regional development and concentrated on balancing economic development.

        <p>The results show that Latin America and the Caribbean and Africa are two regions that need to improve their SSCM performance. These regions also show different trends than the other regions. In particular, Latin America and the Caribbean should focus more on risk management, industry 4.0, policy, remanufacturing, and SCND, while Africa shows concerning patterns related to eco-efficiency and risk management, in addition to the other common trends.The results show that Latin America and the Caribbean and Africa are two regions that need to improve their SSCM performance.

        <p>Supply chains involve complex environmental and social elements aligned with varied participant prospects that aggravate risk-related sustainability (Rebs et al., 2018). Firms refuse to change their goods to satisfy regulations, bribe government agencies to fake inspection documents to gain legitimacy, and lack operational transparency (Azmat and Ha, 2013). Suppliers cheat their customers by buying guarantees through certification labels from third-party auditors without satisfying the practical requirements (Jia et al., 2018). Purchasers continue to buy products produced with child labor or that causes environmental pollution due to their low price without calling for responsible practices (Otanez and Glantz, 2011). There is acquiescence to crises and imitation among supply chain stakeholders, certification providers and the government (Silvestre, 2015), implying that SSCM may expose a high level of risk that corrupts network performance. The perceived impacts and effects from the risks that actually exist may cause serious damage to SCs (Soni and Kodali, 2013). Nevertheless, the region is a fast-growing market; poor infrastructure, booming urbanization, expensive and inefficient logistics, and many social issues continue to cause major problems, as noted by both practitioners and scholars (Yoshizaki et al., 2018). Therefore, future studies should invest in offering better support for the risk management decision-making process in Latin America and the Caribbean region.Supply chains involve complex environmental and social elements aligned with varied participant prospects that aggravate risk-related sustainability (Rebs et al., 2018).

        <p>Risk management entails supply chain responses that counteract vulnerabilities by choosing the most appropriate risk response solution and planning how that solution should be applied (Manuj et al., 2014, Sahebjamnia et al., 2018). The main practice is to ensure the capability to prevent the unnecessary disruption of barriers, which represents a disadvantage for environmental performance due to the negative impact of supply chain activities on resource consumption (Carvalho and Cruz-Machado, 2011). The type of response chosen by decision makers is affected by the risk consequences (Heckmann et al., 2015). In fact, uncertainty drives firms to move from an effective approach to integrated efficient solutions where efficiency is only important when it ensures an adequate level of SCM to address unpredicted events. The increasing market volatility in the region, as well as the increasing fluctuation of demand and risk of supply disruption lead to a push for more agile, less expensive and more flexible supply chain design due to natural disasters or human activity.Risk management entails supply chain responses that counteract vulnerabilities by choosing the most appropriate risk response solution and planning how that solution should be applied (Manuj et al., 2014, Sahebjamnia et al., 2018).

        <p>Supply chain risk management practices could impact environmental performance, but studies do not investigate further whether this impact is positive or negative (Govindan et al., 2014). More elaboration of the complex challenges associated with SSCM methods is needed, given that the multidimensional sustainable viewpoints proposed by SSCM bring together a set of goals and agendas that include a potential risk of conflict between organizations and insiders (Bastas and Liyanage, 2018). This requires firms to standardize and replicate their virtual supply chain process as globalization advances. Risk identification, assessment, management, monitoring, control, and communication and the development of simulation models and optimization technology combined with efficient SCND models represent potential gaps for further exploration (Oliveira et al., 2019). The Latin America and Caribbean supply chain sector now has great potential to invest in not only practical implementation but also academic development with the aggregate of countries having high production capabilities and global interaction.Supply chain risk management practices could impact environmental performance, but studies do not investigate further whether this impact is positive or negative (Govindan et al., 2014).

        <p>Africa holds a small market share in the global supply chain network but has high potential to reduce the risk for new entrants, as manufacturing is expected to expand widely due to active investment from India and China. The region faces complex elements that have permanently changed the supply chain environment. This context requires strong analytical ability, a holistic competitive model design, and significant improvement in decision-making ability to meet the market demand or even the global standard. Only a few countries can achieve the distinct capability to develop economic development-based, ongoing innovation and the technology associated with low-cost labor. Poor supply chain infrastructure and facilities, a lack of training and education, a large knowledge gap, energy consumption problems, a lack of leadership, payment delays on initial investments, an unequal structure and high management risks are issues that remain unsolved (Moktadir et al., 2019b). The integration of multidimensional assessments into SCM will result in more balanced, comprehensive and efficient SSCM implementation, thereby minimizing the risk by prioritizing certain aspects over others (Bastas and Liyanage, 2018).Africa holds a small market share in the global supply chain network but has high potential to reduce the risk for new entrants, as manufacturing is expected to expand widely due to active investment from India and China.

        <p>In addition, eco-efficiency is also a critical challenge that the region must tackle to improve its SSCM. Eco-efficiency refers to a quantitative management solution that enables a product system to balance resource use through the adoption of a more sustainable concept while still bringing profit to stakeholders (Vásquez et al., 2019). Sustainability concerns have highlighted the significant role of eco-efficient supply chain identification in balancing social, environmental, and economic objectives (Jonkman et al., 2019). The solution quantifies the operating costs associated with reducing environmental impacts without changing consumption and resource productivity, which is calculated as the value or produced quantity divided by the natural resources required for production of the product (Kulak et al., 2016).In addition, eco-efficiency is also a critical challenge that the region must tackle to improve its SSCM.

        <p>Experiential and reliable data are not sufficient to develop more eco-efficient modes in Africa. As national and local data are difficult to collect, the impact of uncertainty on the TBL and other eco-efficient solutions must be quantified through measurement. Nevertheless, most studies in this region assume all data to be deterministic, and uncertainty is rarely taken into account when presenting decision support models for eco-efficient supply chains (Banasik et al, 2019), which presents challenges for further investigation. There are limitations, and research gaps have been identified. The conceptual framework between "efficiency" and "eco-efficiency" in theoretical, practical and empirical studies is not clearly addressed (Huang et al., 2018). Procurement and infrastructure activities are not precise and do not clearly define how they meet sustainable development targets, and a lack of sound legislation and policy frameworks hinders SSCM implementation (Vásquez et al., 2019). Operational barriers; a lack of administration commitment, financial costs and constraints; environmental sustainability problems; poorly integrated monitoring information and traceability systems; poor multitier suppliers; low consumer awareness and demand; and inadequate provision and leadership from industry alliances, NGOs and development agencies still need to be addressed (Agyemang et al., 2018, Jové-Llopis and Segarra-Blasco, 2018).Experiential and reliable data are not sufficient to develop more eco-efficient modes in Africa.

        <p>SSCM has grown rapidly in recent decades and has received much attention from both scholars and practitioners. Although different aspects of the literature and its evolution have been summarized, previous studies have evaluated different parts of the supply chain as independent entities. An integrated assessment is still missing in the extant literature, making it necessary to reveal potential directions for future studies. Hence, this study proposed a hybrid method integrating data-driven analysis, the FDM, the EWM, and the FDEMATEL to (1) identify the critical indicators for future study trends and debate and (2) determine the challenges and knowledge gaps among geographical regions. Quantitative and qualitative approaches are proposed to complement the systematic review and address the challenges of uncertainty and complexity in SSCM. The data-driven analysis applied the VOSviewer and identified the SSCM indicators based on big data from Scopus, with the results represented as visualized information. The FDM is used to refine the valid indicators by computing their perception levels from experts' linguistic references. The EWM is applied to convert the indicator occurrence information into comparable weights to determine the indicator performance among regions. The FDEMATEL method is used to capture the perceptions through linguistic preferences and identify the substantial indicators that should be urgently addressed in future work to improve SSCM. This study contributes to detecting critical indicators as gaps to provide knowledge that assists further studies and practical implementations.SSCM has grown rapidly in recent decades and has received much attention from both scholars and practitioners.

        <p>A prioritization of exploration opportunities is proposed. Since supply chain systems are large and complex, integrating and considering the effect of the flow of products, services, and information through the network are important to operational management (Mohammed et al., 2020). The relationship between the trends and challenges is also worth investigating in future studies. The identified gaps between geographical regions not only contribute local viewpoints but also delineate the comprehensive global state of the art of SSCM. Ninety-two countries/territories were accumulated and then rearranged to provide results for 5 regions: Asia and Oceania, Europe, North America, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. The results showed that the largest amount of SSCM information is provided for Asia and Oceania, followed by Europe and North America. Latin America and the Caribbean and Africa show a need for improvement. Latin America and the Caribbean should focus more on risk management, while Africa shows a distinct pattern of concern regarding eco-efficiency and risk management, in addition to other common trends. SSCM actors can treat this study as a reference source for decision making. Firms, governments and professionals can refer to this study for useful information supporting practical design, policy strategies and perceived planning based on regional insights to endorse innovative accomplishments. Some limitations exist in this study. The data-driven analysis may not be sufficiently detailed to initiate quality assessment because Scopus also includes low-impact sources and is limited to the most recent information (Shukla et al., 2019).
