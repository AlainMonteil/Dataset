        <p>We examine whether the joint provision of corporate social responsibility (CSR) assurance services and financial audit by the same audit firm influences auditors' assessment of going concern risk. We predict that the provision of CSR assurance and financial audit by the same audit firm creates CSRrelated knowledge spillovers from the CSR assurance team to the financial audit engagement team, which help in the auditor's assessment of going concern risk. Using more than 28,000 firm-year observations from 55 countries, we document that, relative to audit firms that provide only the financial audit, audit firms that provide both CSR assurance and financial audit for the same client (1) issue more frequent going concern opinions and have lower Type-II going concern errors, (2) have clients that book larger environmental and litigation provisions, (3) report earnings that are more persistent and value relevant and are less likely to book income-decreasing earnings restatements, and (4) do not charge higher audit fees or total fees. Our results are important especially because of firms' increasing exposure to CSR risks and the growing number of countries that require assurance of CSR reports.We examine whether the joint provision of corporate social responsibility (CSR) assurance services and financial audit by the same audit firm influences auditors' assessment of going concern risk.

        <p>Under the stakeholder view, firms are responsible for an array of activities such as preventing environmental externalities, producing safe and healthy products, ensuring the human development of their employees, contributing to government spending by paying taxes, and finding suppliers that respect regulations and ethical principles; in other words, firms are responsible for more than just maximizing shareholder value. This shift to the stakeholder view is evident as more and more firms respond to stakeholders' demand for non-financial information by issuing CSR reports in an attempt to provide information about non-financial performance and the associated risks regarding issues such as environmental performance, social performance, and corporate governance (Cahan, De Villiers, Jeter, Naiker, and Van Staden 2015;Chen, Hung, and Wang 2018;Stolowy and Paugam 2018).Under the stakeholder view, firms are responsible for an array of activities such as preventing environmental externalities, producing safe and healthy products, ensuring the human development of their employees, contributing to government spending by paying taxes, and finding suppliers that respect regulations and ethical principles; in other words, firms are responsible for more than just maximizing shareholder value.

        <p>CSR reports help outsiders to assess the extent of risks associated with CSR performance (Steinmeier and Stich 2019). These reports are frequently verified by assurance providers to enhance their credibility (Pflugrath, Roebuck, and Simnett 2011;Cohen and Simnett 2015;Peters and Romi 2015;Ballou, Chen, Grenier, and Heitger 2018;Steinmeier and Stich 2019). By assuring this information, auditors may gain knowledge about new types of risks that are becoming more important as the regulatory environment is increasingly influenced by the stakeholder view of the firm in matters such as environmental regulation, firm legal responsibilities, and rules with regard to labor and the safety of products. Obtaining such knowledge is part of the auditor's mission according to international auditing standards (ISA 250). 1 Because CSR risks have implications for financial statements, auditors, regardless of whether they also provide CSR assurance, must obtain knowledge about CSR risks to conduct the financial audit per international auditing standards. Although auditors do not verify all their clients' accounts, they must employ reasonable means (e.g., sampling) to ensure that the financial statements give a true and fair view of the firm's financial position and performance for the period. Auditors may overlook relevant information related to CSR risks, especially if their audit firm does not provide CSR assurance services. We reason that audit firms that provide both CSR assurance and financial audit to the same client could obtain additional information about CSR risks compared to audit firms that perform only the financial audit.CSR reports help outsiders to assess the extent of risks associated with CSR performance (Steinmeier and Stich 2019).

        <p>CSR assurance stands apart from other non-audit services for at least two reasons. First, unlike other types of non-audit services, which focus on specific matters such as tax, information technology, 1 ISA 250, Consideration of Laws and Regulations in an Audit of Financial Statements. The International Federation of Accountants, through the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB), issues International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). The use of ISAs is quite widespread internationally. According to IAASB (2016), 111 countries adopted ISAs as of December 31, 2015. Some jurisdictions have been using ISAs for a long period. Since 2006, all European countries must use ISAs for statutory audits (The Audit Directive of May 17, 2006). and certain transactions, the assurance of CSR reports can provide firm-wide CSR-specific knowledge to auditors. Second, CSR assurance is different because regulators are likely to require assurance of CSR reports in the near future (High-Level Expert Group on Sustainable Finance 2018) and have already done so in some jurisdictions. 2 It is therefore important for clients to understand the implications for auditors' assessment of going concern risk of CSR assurance services provided by the same audit firm or by a different assurance provider because firms have to decide whether to retain their audit firm to provide CSR assurance. Policy makers must also decide whether to permit financial auditors to also provide CSR assurance services to their audit clients.

        <p>Specific knowledge about CSR performance can create valuable information for auditors to more accurately assess firm-specific CSR risks. For instance, failure to apply laws or regulations, firm activities such as those involving pollution of water or soils and conflicts with employees, the use of hazardous substances, and dependence on a major customer or supplier exposed to CSR risks such as human rights abuse can have material consequences for financial statements (Barth and McNichols 1994). Failure to comply with the regulatory environment leads to fines, penalties, litigation and, sometimes, to going concern risk. Valuable knowledge about such risks could be gained if the audit firm also provides assurance services for the client's CSR report. Information transfers from the CSR assurance team to the financial audit team could lead to better assessment of CSR risks. If the financial the same audit firm and signed discretionary accruals, a positive association with going concern opinion, and no association with audit fees. Our study differs in several important ways from Lu et al. (2019). First, we focus on auditors' assessment of going concern risk, Type I and Type II going concern opinion errors, and implications for environmental and litigation provisions. Second, using cross-sectional differences based on industry and firm characteristics, we document variations in the association between the joint CSR assurance and financial audit by the same audit firm and going concern opinions. Third, we present evidence on earnings restatements and the consequence for earnings properties (i.e., persistence and value relevance) of using the same audit firm for CSR assurance and financial audit.Specific knowledge about CSR performance can create valuable information for auditors to more accurately assess firm-specific CSR risks.

        <p>Given that the focus and nature of CSR assurance services differs markedly from that of other non-audit services such as tax and information technology, it is unclear whether the joint provision of CSR assurance and financial audit will have different or similar implications for going concern opinions. Unlike tax, transaction, and information technology services, CSR assurance services involve verification of (non-financial) information similar to financial audits in order to ensure that firms disclose credible and reliable CSR reports. These activities could therefore result in synergies between CSR assurance and financial audits. Additionally, CSR assurance services are relevant for understanding CSR risks, which are becoming more important and have implications for material accounts requiring estimates, such as provisions. However, it is not clear ex ante whether the provision of CSR assurance services by the same audit firm would necessarily improve auditors' assessment of CSR risks. First, it is possible that financial audit firms that do not provide CSR assurance for their clients also benefit from relevant information related to CSR risks either from existing CSR reports or from communication with the CSR assurance engagement team. There may be communication between financial auditors and CSR assurance providers from a different firm that both perform fieldwork for the same client.

        <p>7 CSR assurance may create a financial dependence between the auditor and the client. Non-audit services are high-margin activities for audit firms relative to low-margin statutory audits (Chung and Kallapur 2003). Based on the non-audit services literature, and assuming CSR assurance is a highmargin activity, CSR assurance could impair the auditor's independence because the revenues received from the client create economic incentives to maintain a profitable relationship. This, in turn, could lead the auditor to avoid reporting discovered misstatements in financial audits (or to respond positively to the financial reporting demands of the client) (Frankel et al. 2002). This economic bonding argument suggests a negative relationship between non-audit services and going concern opinions. 4We examine the implications for going concern opinions of the joint provision of CSR assurance and financial audit by the same (Big 4) audit firm for an international sample of more than 28,000 firm-year observations from 55 countries. We control the variation in going concern opinions that may result from differences in auditor type by excluding firms that have non-Big 4 audit firms, while allowing the CSR assurance provider type to vary. We use an international sample because the increasing firm exposure to CSR risks is a global phenomenon. Additionally, an international sample improves the generalizability of our findings relative to a single-country setting and includes considerable variation in economic and business environment conditions that are likely to influence information spillovers from the CSR assurance team to the financial audit engagement team (see online Appendix Table OA1 for a review of local CSR mandatory reporting regulations by country) and to increase the power of our tests.7 CSR assurance may create a financial dependence between the auditor and the client.

        <p>We find that the joint provision of CSR assurance services and financial audit by the same (Big 4) audit firm is positively associated with the frequency of going concern opinions. We document that the provision of both CSR assurance and financial audit by the same Big 4 audit firm is associated with more frequent going concern opinions (the economic magnitude ranges between +2.6 percent and +8.3percent) than the use of a CSR assurance provider different from the Big 4 audit firm. Our findings hold after we control for several other factors that prior research has identified are related to going concern opinions. Because the choice of auditor and CSR assurance provider are managerial decisions, our findings may be affected by endogeneity due to omitted variables or sample heterogeneity (DeFond and Zhang 2014). Although we cannot completely rule out this important concern, we use several statistical techniques to alleviate it. First, we include firm fixed effects, which control for time-invariant unobservable omitted factors, in our main tests (Nikolaev and Van Lent 2005). Second, we corroborate our main results by using alternative techniques such as propensity score matching (Lawrence, Minutti-Meza, and Ping 2011;Shipman, Swanquist, and Whited 2017) and coarsened exact matching (DeFond, Erkens, and Zhang 2016) that relax assumptions about the functional form of variable relations, and two-stage least squares regression using instruments that influence firms' choice of CSR assurance provider but are exogenous to firms' innate characteristics (Larcker and Rusticus 2010).We find that the joint provision of CSR assurance services and financial audit by the same (Big 4) audit firm is positively associated with the frequency of going concern opinions.

        <p>In further analyses, we find that the joint provision of CSR assurance and financial audit is positively associated with various proxies for Type-I going concern opinion error (i.e., issuing a qualified audit report when, in fact, there is no going concern risk), which indicates a more prudent audit. Conversely, we find a negative association between the joint provision of CSR assurance and financial audit and various proxies for Type-II going concern opinion error (i.e., failure to detect a firm with significant going concern risk), which is evidence that audit firms that perform both CSR assurance and financial audit for a client assess going concern risks better than do audit firms that perform only financial audit.

Second, in cross-sectional tests based on industry and firm characteristics, we find that the joint provision of CSR assurance and financial audit is associated with more frequent going concern opinions in environmentally sensitive industries and for firms for which knowledge spillover effects are more likely because of their stakeholder-orientation. These results confirm that knowledge spillovers depend on industry characteristics and firm characteristics. Third, we find that audit fees and total fees are not higher when a client relies on the same Big 4 audit firm to provide CSR assurance services and financial audit than when a client uses a different provider for CSR assurance and financial audit. This result indicates that the better assessment of CSR risks comes at no greater cost to the client.

        <p>Our study makes several contributions to the literature. Prior research on non-audit services shows that some services, such as tax-related non-audit services, actually improve financial audits (Kinney et al. 2004). We contribute to this line of research by exploring an under-researched, specific type of non-audit service, CSR assurance, that relates to risks that have increased over time with the importance of the stakeholder view of the firm. CSR assurance is markedly different from other nonaudit services and hence the findings from the non-audit services literature cannot be easily generalized to this type of service. Although prior studies explore the implications of the type of CSR assurance provider for CSR assurance quality (Pflugrath et al. 2011;Ballou et al. 2018), they do not examine whether CSR assurance relates to the auditors' assessment of going concern risks. Our study has important implications as the 2008-09 financial crisis raised concerns about the quality of auditors' work and whether auditors were sufficiently independent to report accounting misstatements (ACCA 2011). Responding to these concerns, several jurisdictions issued regulations in an attempt to strengthen financial auditor independence, including limiting certain forms of nonaudit services (e.g., European Commission 2011b, 2011a; European Parliament and Council of the European Union 2014). 5 Our findings suggest that the joint provision of CSR assurance and financial audit can provide valuable knowledge spillovers that lead to improved assessment of the financial implications of CSR risks.Our study makes several contributions to the literature.

In the last few years, an increasing number of firms, especially larger ones, have begun issuing assured CSR reports (O'Dwyer and Owen 2007;KPMG 2013;Ernst &amp; Young and Global Reporting Initiative 2014). This is evident from the percentage of the top 250 global firms that issued an assured CSR report, which increased from 46 percent in 2011 to 59 percent in 2013 (KPMG 2013). Of these large global firms, approximately two thirds that issued assured CSR reports used the services of a Big 4 audit firm (KPMG 2013). Simnett, Vanstraelen, and Chua (2009b) investigate the determinants of CSR assurance for an international sample of firms. They find a positive association between firms looking to enhance the credibility of CSR reports and increase their reputation and the use of external CSR assurance. Using a sample of European public firms, Fuhrmann, Ott, Looks, and Guenther (2017) show that issuers of assured CSR reports with a high level of assurance exhibit lower bid-ask spread than matched firms that issue unassured CSR reports. Michelon, Patten, and Romi (2018) find that the provision of CSR assurance is positively associated with CSR report restatements.Firms that disclose CSR information may voluntarily rely on assurance services from a third party to enhance the credibility of the reported information (Simnett, Nugent, and Huggins 2009a;Brown-Liburd and Zamora 2015).

        <p>CSR assurance also relates to another important question: are audit firms, in particular Big 4 firms, able to deliver superior CSR assurance relative to other CSR assurance providers such as CSR specialists like Bureau Veritas, Lloyd's, DNV, and ERM? DeFond and Zhang (2014) argue that the expansion of audit firms to sustainability assurance services raises the question of whether auditors' incentives and skills transfer to the verification of non-financial information. CSR specialists maintain that they have superior industry expertise regarding CSR activities and are therefore better equipped to provide assurance services than are audit firms. Conversely, Big 4 audit firms claim that they can deliver better quality CSR report assurance because they can benefit from their unique skills and the methodologies used in financial audits. Big 4 audit firms argue that their reputation and geographical networks are important for providing high quality CSR assurance for large clients. These audit firms can acquire or develop internal expertise related to CSR activities. Pflugrath et al. (2011), in an experimental setting, examine whether assurance enhances the credibility of CSR reports for financial analysts and test whether the type of assurance provider (i.e., professional accountant or CSR specialist) matters. The results show that participants view CSR reports assured by professional accountants as more credible than unassured CSR reports. Simnett et al. (2009b) find that firms located in stakeholder-oriented countries tend to choose assurance providers from the accounting profession. Ballou et al. (2018) show that auditors identify inaccuracies in CSR reports earlier and prevent future CSR reporting inaccuracies better than do other types of CSR assurance providers.CSR assurance also relates to another important question: are audit firms, in particular Big 4 firms, able to deliver superior CSR assurance relative to other CSR assurance providers such as CSR specialists like Bureau Veritas, Lloyd's, DNV, and ERM?

        <p>Our study contributes to this line of research by investigating the interactions between the provision of CSR assurance and financial audit by the same firm or by two different firms and its implications for the perception of CSR risks by the audit firm.

        <p>According to Morimoto, Ash, and Hope (2005), based on interviews with individuals from the government, the private sector, academia and NGOs, CSR reports allow stakeholders to obtain information about the following six important factors of a successful CSR strategy: (1) how the firm conducts stakeholder management; (2) how the firm benefits from good corporate leadership; (3) how the firm gives priority to CSR at the board level; (4) how the firm integrates CSR into corporate policy at all levels and in all business units; (5) how the firm understands and manages national and international CSR regulations across its activities, and (6) how the firm is active and coordinated with government, NGOs and civil society. By reviewing the accuracy and completeness of such CSR information, audit firms that provide CSR assurance services can obtain knowledge about how the firm addresses CSR risks.According to Morimoto, Ash, and Hope (2005), based on interviews with individuals from the government, the private sector, academia and NGOs, CSR reports allow stakeholders to obtain information about the following six important factors of a successful CSR strategy: (1) how the firm conducts stakeholder management; (2) how the firm benefits from good corporate leadership; (3) how the firm gives priority to CSR at the board level; (4) how the firm integrates CSR into corporate policy at all levels and in all business units; (5) how the firm understands and manages national and international CSR regulations across its activities, and (6) how the firm is active and coordinated with government, NGOs and civil society.

        <p>According to GRI (2013), external assurance of CSR reports covers three phases: planning, execution, and reporting and feedback. Planning is done at the start of the process, but also needs to be done on an iterative basis throughout the engagement as issues appear and the fieldwork needs to be adjusted. During the execution phase, the CSR assurance team can have access to evidence such as inventory records, personnel data, supplier details and interviews with managers or board members (GRI 2013). Once the execution is completed, the CSR assurance provider issues a report (often signed) that is usually an integral part of CSR reporting. This report often includes the following information: the intended audience, the scope of disclosures covered, the level of assurance, the assurance standards used, the limitations of the assurance, activities performed, and conclusions.According to GRI (2013), external assurance of CSR reports covers three phases: planning, execution, and reporting and feedback.

        <p>It is quite likely that during these three phases, the work conducted by the CSR assurance team overlaps with the work of the audit engagement team, especially for large listed firms for which financial auditors are often working at the client's office at several times during the fiscal year. The audit engagement team is often present during the pre-closing period, the closing period before the issuance of the annual report, and sometimes during interim reviews. Annual CSR reports are often published around the same time as the annual financial reports (sometimes in a single document), which makes it likely that the two teams exchange information. In addition, working for the same audit firm, partners or senior managers in charge of CSR assurance and financial audit could exchange relevant information using the internal communication channels of their audit firm.It is quite likely that during these three phases, the work conducted by the CSR assurance team overlaps with the work of the audit engagement team, especially for large listed firms for which financial auditors are often working at the client's office at several times during the fiscal year.

        <p>Prior literature that focuses on non-audit services such as tax consulting, management advisory services, public securities offering, or information systems consulting argues that non-audit services may generate valuable knowledge spillovers for financial audits (Koh et al. 2013;Svanström 2013;Bell et al. 2015). Similarly, CSR assurance services provided by the same audit firm may facilitate information transfer between the CSR assurance team and the financial audit engagement team. 6 The provision of sustainability assurance could help auditors identify risks related to CSR activities (O'Dwyer, Owen, and Unerman 2011). Steinmeier and Stich (2019) argue that CSR assurance improves sustainability investment decisions because it increases the set of information available for managerial decision making and thus leads to improved investment efficiency. In addition, Steinmeier and Stich (2019) find that CSR assurance reduces information asymmetry between managers and investors, which in turn facilitates monitoring of sustainability investment decisions. The authors also report some evidence of a stronger effect when the audit firm also provides CSR assurance. If credible CSR information generates valuable information for managers and investors, then auditors who review and verify CSR information may also be able to obtain a richer set of information about their client using first-hand knowledge that leads to a better and more efficient financial audit. 6 An interview with a manager at an audit firm that provides CSR assurance services indicates that these knowledge spillovers exist. For instance, the manager talked about the inadequate information system of a listed firm's subsidiary that the CSR assurance team uncovered while reviewing employee information. The information was passed on to the financial audit engagement team.Prior literature that focuses on non-audit services such as tax consulting, management advisory services, public securities offering, or information systems consulting argues that non-audit services may generate valuable knowledge spillovers for financial audits (Koh et al. 2013;Svanström 2013;Bell et al. 2015).

        <p>Financial audit teams collect audit evidence to assess whether the financial statements give a true and fair view of the firm's performance and financial position. If auditors have access to information from the CSR assurance team, they may be able to work more efficiently to collect audit evidence by reallocating resources based on information gained from the CSR assurance team. If the audit engagement team already has information about potential CSR risks, then it can more efficiently allocate its costly, scarce resources. For instance, the CSR assurance team may review a client's payroll and staff numbers to assess the accuracy of the social dimension of reported CSR information such as gender pay gap and find problems in the internal information system, which it could share with the audit engagement team. The auditors could then directly focus on the implications for the financial audit of the discovered problems in the client's information system instead of investigating the origin of the problem. Similarly, the CSR assurance team could share information with the audit engagement team on environmental matters such as carbon emission that may have implications for financial statements by potentially affecting litigation costs and environmental liabilities such as provisions for environmental risk and participation in carbon emission trading schemes. Some CSR issues give rise to the risk of a material omission or misstated financial statements.Financial audit teams collect audit evidence to assess whether the financial statements give a true and fair view of the firm's performance and financial position.

        <p>For instance, failure to apply specific laws or regulations, firm activities such as those involving pollution of soil, groundwater or air, use of hazardous substances, or dependence on a major customer affected by CSR risks can have important consequences for financial statements. Failure to comply with the regulatory environment leads to fines, penalties, litigation and, sometimes, to going concern risk. Hence, obtaining a general understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the entity and how the entity is complying with that framework is part of international auditing standards (ISA 250). 7 Performing both CSR assurance and financial audit for the same client facilitates obtaining a better understanding of such risks.For instance, failure to apply specific laws or regulations, firm activities such as those involving pollution of soil, groundwater or air, use of hazardous substances, or dependence on a major customer affected by CSR risks can have important consequences for financial statements.

        <p>However, the existence of knowledge spillovers for audit firms that perform CSR assurance and financial audit jointly is not straightforward. First, audit firms that do not provide CSR assurance may benefit from knowledge spillovers from reviewing existing CSR reports. Auditors could, at a minimum, look at prior years' CSR reports to obtain information about CSR risks faced by their client. There could also be communications between the CSR assurance firm and the audit firm especially if the teams are doing fieldwork at the same time. Relevant information could also be exchanged between different assurance providers and audit firms via management and/or the audit committee. Second, CSR assurance providers often provide only limited assurance, which can reduce the extent to which such services reveal meaningful information to auditors about CSR risks even if an audit firm performs both CSR assurance and financial audit (O'Dwyer andOwen 2005, 2007).However, the existence of knowledge spillovers for audit firms that perform CSR assurance and financial audit jointly is not straightforward.

        <p>Third, because non-audit services are high-margin activities (Chung and Kallapur 2003), the nonaudit services literature suggests that such services may create economic bonding between the auditor and the client, which could ultimately lead to inferior audit quality because the auditor has pressure to accept client demands (Simunic 1984;Beck et al. 1988). Economic bonding is more likely if the client has weak corporate governance (Larcker and Richardson 2004) or if the client is a high-growth firm (Reynolds, Deis, and Francis 2004). Causholli, Chambers, and Payne (2014) suggest that future non-audit services fees impair current audit quality because, prior to SOX, auditors had an incentive to compromise current audit quality to sell more non-audit services in future years. This is so because their compensation package is structured to reward non-audit services revenue. It is therefore also possible that CSR assurance services create an economic bond between the auditor and the client and thus impair audit quality.Third, because non-audit services are high-margin activities (Chung and Kallapur 2003), the nonaudit services literature suggests that such services may create economic bonding between the auditor and the client, which could ultimately lead to inferior audit quality because the auditor has pressure to accept client demands (Simunic 1984;Beck et al. 1988).

        <p>Given these competing arguments, we state the following hypothesis in its null form: HYPOTHESIS 1: The joint provision of CSR assurance services and financial audit by the same audit firm is unrelated to the auditor's assessment of CSR risks.Given these competing arguments, we state the following hypothesis in its null form: HYPOTHESIS 1: The joint provision of CSR assurance services and financial audit by the same audit firm is unrelated to the auditor's assessment of CSR risks.</p>

Including non-Big 4 audit firms would lead to greater heterogeneity in financial audit quality and client characteristics, which would decrease the reliability of the analysis.

        <p>We include firms that do not issue a CSR report for two reasons. First, we note that a firm's classification may differ over time if the firm changes its CSR reporting practices. When we include firm fixed effects, we capture within-firm variation in use of CSR assurance, use of the same, or of a different CSR assurance provider. Some firms change their CSR reporting practice from not issuing a CSR report in one year to issuing an assured CSR report in another year. By including firms that do not issue a CSR report, we can capture these effects and thus conduct more powerful tests. The second 8 We include financial firms in our sample because, unlike for discretionary accruals, financial institutions' going concern opinions are not industry specific. In addition, CSR risks also affect financial institutions, which face material litigation costs such as money laundering scandals and corruption. We also find more frequent going concern opinions for firms that use the same audit firm for CSR assurance and financial audit if we exclude financial institutions from the sample.We include firms that do not issue a CSR report for two reasons.

        <p>To identify whether a firm uses the same audit firm for CSR assurance and financial audit, we obtain the code of the financial statement auditor for each firm-year observation from Eikon. Because the auditor code is standardized in two to four alphabetical characters, we match the auditor code with the auditor's full name provided by Eikon. We use a computer-based procedure to identify Big 4 auditors that provide the financial audit and manually check the resulting classification. 9 We obtain the full name of the CSR assurance provider for each firm-year observation from Eikon and, using the same procedure described for audit firms, identify Big 4 firms that provide CSR assurance services. We classify all non-Big 4 CSR assurance providers in the "Others" category. 10 We then 9 The computer-based procedure identifies whether the auditor's full name contains the following substrings: ERNST, E&amp;Y, YOUNG, KPMG, PRICE, PwC, DELOITTE, TOUCHE. If one or more of these substrings occurs, the procedure classifies the observation under the appropriate Big 4. To correctly identify observations indicating EY as the CSR assurance provider, we isolate observations containing the substring EY in the Others category and manually check the resulting classification. 10 The "Others" category includes either non-Big 4 audit firms or CSR specialists. To ensure that our results are not driven by the potentially lower CSR assurance quality associated with other CSR assurance providers, in online Appendix Table OA11, we distinguish between observations with a different Big 4 CSR assurance provider from the financial auditor and create auditor and CSR report assurance provider pairs by identifying the CSR assurance provider and the financial audit firm for each firm-year observation. 11 Whereas only 5.9 percent of firms issued a CSR report in 2002, the percentage increased to 34.8 percent in 2017. Regarding CSR assurance, the number of firms that issued an assured CSR report increased from only two in 2002 (one with a different assurance provider from its audit firm and one with the same assurance provider as its audit firm) to 765 firms in 2017 (462 firms with a different assurance provider from its audit firm and 303 with the same assurance provider as its audit firm).

        <p>Among firms that use a CSR assurance provider, we find a positive trend in the use of the same Big 4 audit firm for CSR assurance. In 2007 (when the number of firms that use CSR assurance starts to increase), 25.6 percent of firms (= 60 / (60 + 174)) used their Big 4 audit firm to assure their CSR observations with a non-Big 4 CSR assurance provider or a CSR specialist. In multivariate tests, we find that firms using the same Big 4 audit firm for financial audit and CSR assurance exhibit more frequent going concern opinions than both firms that use a non-Big 4 assurance provider or a different Big 4 assurance provider. The difference between use of the same assurance provider and use of a non-Big 4 assurance provider is greater than that between use of the same assurance provider and use of a different Big 4 assurance. 11 When identifying firms that use their financial auditor to assure their CSR report, we find that Asset 4 either incorrectly or incompletely classifies some firm-year observations. For example, Asset 4 classifies some firms as using CSR report assurance services despite them being coded as not issuing a CSR report (408 observations), and Eikon does not (does) contain the name of the CSR assurance provider for some firm-year observations that are classified in Asset 4 as using (not using) assurance services for their CSR report (795 observations).

        <p>We focus on going concern opinions in our main tests because potential issues associated with CSR risks can have a material effect on financial statements (Barth and McNichols 1994) and on the ability of the firm to operate as a going concern. This is true especially considering society's increasing expectations about firms' CSR. Going concern opinions have been used in past research as a measure of audit quality. Higher audit quality is generally associated with higher likelihood of a going concern opinion being issued by auditors because such a qualified audit report demonstrates the auditor's ability to detect problems and independence to report them (Bills, Swanquist, and Whited 2016;Hardies, Breesch, and Branson 2016;Lamoreaux 2016;Pincus, Tian, Wellmeyer, and Xu 2017). 13 Compared to other measures of audit quality such as abnormal accruals, going concern opinion is a more direct measure of audit quality that is less subject to measurement error, which is of particular concern in an international setting.We focus on going concern opinions in our main tests because potential issues associated with CSR risks can have a material effect on financial statements (Barth and McNichols 1994) and on the ability of the firm to operate as a going concern.

        <p>12 Panel B of Table 2 shows the sample distribution based on the providers of financial audits and CSR assurance. Of the 6,468 observations that issue an assured CSR report, 3,202 (49.5 percent) are assured by a non-Big 4 assurance provider or a CSR specialist, and 3,266 (50.5 percent) by a Big 4 audit firm. The Big 4 audit firm market shares for CSR report assurance services range from 10.2 percent for Deloitte to 14.9 percent for PwC. Firms that use a Big 4 audit firm to provide CSR assurance services are more likely to use their Big 4 audit firm than a different Big 4 audit firm to provide these services.This is evident from the number of observations in the diagonal of Table 2 panel B, which is larger than the numbers in the off-diagonals. 13 We also consider two alternate measures of audit quality: discretionary accruals (Dechow and Dichev 2002;Kothari, Leone, and Wasley 2005) and small profit (Aobdia 2018). We find no association between using the same Big 4 audit firm to provide CSR assurance and financial audit and these two alternative measures of audit quality. These results are not surprising because discretionary accruals and small profits use management's reported earnings that derive from the application of flexible financial reporting standards (Causholli et al. 2014). As such, these measures are designed to capture subtle changes in the quality of audits (Bell et al. 2015). Conversely, going-concern opinions are significant events that attract attention and signal that reputation concerns override economic incentives (Causholli et al. 2014). The effect of knowledge gained by auditors performing both CSR assurance and financial audit is less likely to be captured by measures of audit quality such as accruals and small profit.12 Panel B of Table 2 shows the sample distribution based on the providers of financial audits and CSR assurance.

        <p>Type-II error (false negative) relates to issuing a clean audit opinion when, in fact, the firm faces difficulties in the future. The costs of Type I and Type II going concern opinion errors are asymmetrical for auditors. If an auditor does not issue a going concern opinion and the client fails or faces important difficulties (Type-II going concern opinion error), the auditor generally incurs substantial costs related to litigation and loss of reputation (Carson, Fargher, Geiger, Lennox, Raghunandan, and Willekens 2013). On the other hand, if the auditor issues a going concern opinion and the client does not fail (Type-I error), it is also costly for the auditor but the cost relates to upsetting the client, which could lead to a loss of audit revenue. The costs associated with Type-I going concern opinion errors are lower for more independent and more prudent auditors.Type-II error (false negative) relates to issuing a clean audit opinion when, in fact, the firm faces difficulties in the future.

Although bankruptcy is the most direct outcome variable to assess the accuracy of going concern opinions, it is a relatively rare event for the large public firms comprising our sample (Lennox 1999;Francis 2011). First, we use both future bankruptcies and financial distress to examine the accuracy of going concern opinions.

        <p>To show that this effect is specific to CSR risks and to rule out the alternative explanation that firms that use their audit firm as the CSR assurance provider have a different policy for provisions, we perform a falsification test using other operating provisions instead of environmental or litigation provisions. Operating provisions, which relate to recurring events such as maintenance costs, are less likely to be affected by CSR risks than are provisions for environmental and litigation risks. We estimate the following model:To show that this effect is specific to CSR risks and to rule out the alternative explanation that firms that use their audit firm as the CSR assurance provider have a different policy for provisions, we perform a falsification test using other operating provisions instead of environmental or litigation provisions.

        <p>where: PROV is the amount of environmental provision (ENVPROV), litigation provision (LTGPROV), or operating provision (OPTPROV), each divided by total assets (see online Appendix Table OA4 for descriptive statistics for the provision variables). We estimate model (2) for firms with non-missing provision data. In an alternative specification, we replace missing provision values by zero and include an indicator variable for missing data (i.e., MISS_ENVPROV, MISS_LTGPROV and MISS_OPTPROV). We control for the following firm characteristics: firm size (SIZE), negative earnings (LOSS), leverage (LEV), market-to-book (MTB), sales growth (SALESG), firm performance (ROA), stakeholder orientation (STAKE), and governance (GOV). 19 We present estimation results in Table 6.where: PROV is the amount of environmental provision (ENVPROV), litigation provision (LTGPROV), or operating provision (OPTPROV), each divided by total assets (see online Appendix Table OA4 for descriptive statistics for the provision variables).

        <p>Because provisions for environmental risks and litigation risks are accounts that reflect CSR risks in financial statements, these results are consistent with our core argument that providing both CSR assurance and financial audit helps auditors to assess going concern risks. Importantly, we do not find similar evidence for operating provisions, for which there is no reliable difference between ASSURED_DIFF and ASSURED_SAME (see the insignificant t-statistics for b2 = b3 in column (3) and column ( 6)).

        <p>We examine whether the auditors' better assessment of CSR risks for firms that use the same assurance provider as their financial audit firm is associated with specific earnings properties. We focus on two earnings properties: persistence and value relevance of earnings. An audit firm that performs both the financial audit and the CSR assurance may be better able to reflect CSR risks in financial statements, for instance, by booking adequate provisions and thus improving the accuracy of material accounting estimates. If this is the case, earnings are likely to exhibit greater persistence and be more value relevant for firms that use the same assurance provider as their financial auditor than for firms that use a different assurance provider. Indeed, firms that use the same audit firm for CSR assurance and financial audit are less likely to book transitory material items in earnings, thus improving earnings persistence. In addition, actual CSR risks are likely to be better reflected in earnings, thus improving the association between market values and earnings (i.e., the value relevance of earnings).We examine whether the auditors' better assessment of CSR risks for firms that use the same assurance provider as their financial audit firm is associated with specific earnings properties.

If this is the case, earnings are likely to exhibit greater persistence and be more value relevant for firms that use the same assurance provider as their financial auditor than for firms that use a different assurance provider. Indeed, firms that use the same audit firm for CSR assurance and financial audit are less likely to book transitory material items in earnings, thus improving earnings persistence. In addition, actual CSR risks are likely to be better reflected in earnings, thus improving the association between market values and earnings (i.e., the value relevance of earnings).</p>
        <p>Drawing on past research that examines the persistence of earnings (Dichev and Tang 2009;Frankel and Litov 2009;Atwood, Drake, and Myers 2010), we test differences in earnings persistence between ASSURED_SAME and ASSURED_DIFF using the following model ( 4):Drawing on past research that examines the persistence of earnings (Dichev and Tang 2009;Frankel and Litov 2009;Atwood, Drake, and Myers 2010), we test differences in earnings persistence between ASSURED_SAME and ASSURED_DIFF using the following model ( 4):</p>

        <p>Panels A and B of online Appendix Table OA9 present the estimation results of model (4) and model (5), respectively. Panel A shows that earnings of firms that use the same assurance provider as their financial audit firm are approximately 31 percent more persistent than earnings of firms that use a different assurance provider (41 percent = ((0.5445 + 0.0853) / (0.5445 -0.0982)) -1, b7 &gt; b6, pvalue &lt; 0.01). This result is consistent with the argument that, because they include adequate provisions (see Table 6), earnings of firms that use the same assurance provider as their financial audit firm do not include large infrequent adjustments such as expenses caused by CSR risks and, as a result, exhibit earnings that are more persistent.Panels A and B of online Appendix Table OA9 present the estimation results of model (4) and model (5), respectively.

        <p>First, we examine whether our results are limited to Big 4 audit firms or can be generalized to smaller audit firms. We examine Big 7 audit firms instead of Big 4 audit firms, by also including BDO, Grant Thornton, and Mazars. We find a similar effect of more frequent going concern opinions for firms that also use their Big 7 audit firm as a CSR assurance provider than for firms that use a different assurance provider (see column (1) of online Appendix Table OA10). Next, to test whether we can generalize our results to other smaller audit firms, we do not restrict the financial auditor to Big 4 or Big 7 audit firms and compute ASSURED_SAME = 1 for all audit firms that provide both financial audit and CSR assurance. 21 Using this more inclusive measure of ASSURED_SAME, we find evidence of more frequent going concern opinions for firms that rely on the same assurance provider as their auditor (see column (2) of online Appendix Table OA10). This evidence indicates that our results are generalizable to smaller of audit firms.First, we examine whether our results are limited to Big 4 audit firms or can be generalized to smaller audit firms.

        <p>We also test whether our results are sensitive to including observations from countries with a large representation (or a small representation) in our sample. After dropping observations from countries with more than 3,000 observations or less than 500 observations, we find evidence of more frequent going concern opinions for firms that use the same assurance provider as their financial audit firm, consistent with the results reported in Table 4. Because firms located in France and Denmark can use joint auditors for financial statements (this is mandatory in France and optional in Denmark since 2005), we also delete observations from these two countries and obtain consistent findings.We also test whether our results are sensitive to including observations from countries with a large representation (or a small representation) in our sample.

        <p>Assurance of CSR reports has become more common in recent years (KPMG 2013;Ernst &amp; Young and Global Reporting Initiative 2014). This phenomenon results from the increasing importance of CSR activities to stakeholders and the pressure for management to increase the credibility of CSR disclosures. As more and more firms use assurance services for their CSR reports, a key decision is whether to use a CSR assurance provider that is also the financial audit firm or to use a different CSR assurance provider.

        <p>Using an international sample of firms from 55 countries, we find evidence that firms that use the same Big 4 audit firm for the financial audit and the provision of CSR assurance exhibit more frequent going concern opinions than firms that use a different CSR assurance provider. This finding is robust to several statistical techniques for addressing concerns about sample heterogeneity, functional relations between variables, and endogeneity. Our evidence also indicates that auditors that also provide CSR assurance to their clients make more frequent Type-I going concern opinion errors, less frequent Type-II going concern opinion errors, and have clients that book larger environmental and litigation provisions than auditors that do not provide CSR assurance to their clients.Using an international sample of firms from 55 countries, we find evidence that firms that use the same Big 4 audit firm for the financial audit and the provision of CSR assurance exhibit more frequent going concern opinions than firms that use a different CSR assurance provider.

        <p>Additional analyses show that income-decreasing restatements are less likely for firms that rely on their financial audit firm to also provide CSR assurance than for firms that use a different assurance provider. The frequency of going concern opinion issuance is higher for firms that are more stakeholder-oriented and for firms operating in environmentally sensitive industries if they use the same audit firm for CSR assurance and financial audit. We also show that the improved assessment of CSR risks by auditors that jointly provide financial audit and CSR report assurance is not associated with audit fees or total fees paid by the client. This finding corroborates the argument of information sharing and potential operating synergies between the CSR assurance team and the audit engagement team. We find that the superior assessment of CSR risks stemming from the joint provision of CSR assurance and financial audit is associated with more persistent and more value relevant earnings.Additional analyses show that income-decreasing restatements are less likely for firms that rely on their financial audit firm to also provide CSR assurance than for firms that use a different assurance provider.

        <p>Our findings have important implications for managers because regulators are considering making assurance of CSR reports mandatory. Our findings could help managers in deciding which assurance provider to retain because they show better assessment of CSR risks and no greater cost for firms that also use their Big 4 financial audit firm for CSR assurance. Our study is also important for regulators who are considering restricting auditors from providing some types of non-audit services.Our findings have important implications for managers because regulators are considering making assurance of CSR reports mandatory.

        <p>Although the dependent variable is binary, we use an OLS model instead of a logistic model in our main analysis because our model includes several fixed effects, which are difficult to interpret in a logistic model. In addition, according toWoolridge (2006, p. 454) "the LPM [linear probability model] should be seen as a convenient approximation to the underlying response probability". By using OLS, we can directly estimate the effect of the independent variables on the probability of a going concern opinion. Another advantage of the OLS model over the logistic model is that it facilitates a more direct comparison of coefficients.
