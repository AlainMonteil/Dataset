        <p>This review aims to assess consumer choices of sustainable fish products, considering a number of attributes that have been considered in the academic literature on this topic. In order to examine the effectiveness of sustainable labels, the research question was focused on the relation between sustainable fish labels and consumers' willingness to pay (WTP). The findings showed how, overall, consumers have positive perceptions regarding sustainable fish products and show a willingness to pay a premium price for the attribute of sustainability. According to the results, the country of origin attribute was found to be the most important attribute in relation to consumer choice. The results indicated a high WTP for local fish products, relative to imported alternatives. Consumers prefer wild-caught fish for its perceived quality, better safety and health aspects, and taste perception than the farm-raised option. As for animal welfare, the results show that consumers are willing to pay a moderate premium price for products that have an improved fish welfare or those that avoid by-catch, such as products with eco-labels like "turtle safe". With regard to organic labels, the studies identified a positive organic price premium for fish products. However, organic labels do not play a major role in consumer choice, when compared with other attributes.This review aims to assess consumer choices of sustainable fish products, considering a number of attributes that have been considered in the academic literature on this topic.

        <p>Given the current increasing demand for fish products and the consequent depletion of fish stocks and marine natural resources, public concern about sustainable fish production and fishery management has risen. As a result of the growing worldwide population, higher living standards, and widespread recognition of the health benefits of fish consumption, the demand for fish products has been growing worldwide, playing an important role in feeding the world's population. This trend has generated a negative impact on natural resources due to overfishing, which is becoming unsustainable for several fish species and the marine environment [1][2][3][4][5][6][7].Given the current increasing demand for fish products and the consequent depletion of fish stocks and marine natural resources, public concern about sustainable fish production and fishery management has risen.

        <p>With the decline of wild fish stocks, the aquaculture sector has begun to play an increasingly important role in meeting the growing worldwide demand for fish products. Aquaculture can generate a negative impact on environmental resources due to the factors relating to intensive fish farming practices, such as the escape of genetically modified farmed fish, contamination of wild fish stocks, and release of effluents, disrupting the natural performance of marine ecosystems [1,3,8,9].With the decline of wild fish stocks, the aquaculture sector has begun to play an increasingly important role in meeting the growing worldwide demand for fish products.

        <p>The growing consumption of fish products and current pressure on natural resources have generated an increasing interest in sustainable fish, adding weight to the call for a shared understanding of sustaining the natural capacity of marine ecosystems to provide food products. The demand for sustainable fish has also gained increasing importance in the framework of political discourse on sustainable food systems. The institutional attention regarding sustainable fisheries is also related to the growing consumer interest in the dimensions of sustainability in food products [10][11][12].The growing consumption of fish products and current pressure on natural resources have generated an increasing interest in sustainable fish, adding weight to the call for a shared understanding of sustaining the natural capacity of marine ecosystems to provide food products.

        <p>In the modern fish sector, consumers are concerned with all dimensions of sustainability, indicating a sustainability-centric consumer vision. In this regard, it is important for fish producers to meet consumer demand for credence characteristics related to the broad concept of sustainability [12,13].In the modern fish sector, consumers are concerned with all dimensions of sustainability, indicating a sustainability-centric consumer vision. In this regard, it is important for fish producers to meet consumer demand for credence characteristics related to the broad concept of sustainability [12,13].</p>
        <p>Consumers are interested in credence attributes, which have several intangible features, such as the sustainable management of natural resources and environmental protection, support for small-scale enterprises, maintenance of local communities, shorter transportation distances of products to local markets, attention to animal welfare, avoidance of incidentally by-caught non-targeted species, and sustainable fishing methods. Thus, the use of labels indicating credence cues has become an important search attribute for consumers and an important instrument in the promotion of sustainable fish products. Food labels related to credence attributes enhance consumer awareness and support consumer choices in line with their attitudes and preferences. However, although consumer attitudes toward sustainability are generally positive, behavioral patterns are not always consistent with consumer choices [4,6,13,14].Consumers are interested in credence attributes, which have several intangible features, such as the sustainable management of natural resources and environmental protection, support for small-scale enterprises, maintenance of local communities, shorter transportation distances of products to local markets, attention to animal welfare, avoidance of incidentally by-caught non-targeted species, and sustainable fishing methods.

        <p>Despite the fact that a growing number of studies in the literature on this topic have been carried out in recent decades, the knowledge on the above-mentioned topic in the academic literature is still heterogeneous. Therefore, it is challenging to identify patterns in consumer choices, without analyzing the results of the studies in the literature on this topic [12].Despite the fact that a growing number of studies in the literature on this topic have been carried out in recent decades, the knowledge on the above-mentioned topic in the academic literature is still heterogeneous.

The dependent variable is the WTP for each fish attribute. The average and standard deviation of each variable (dependent and independent) are determined in order to statistically highlight its relative importance. Moreover, we estimated a regression model in which the dependent variable is the WTP defined as an extra percentage of the price that consumers are willing to pay for the purchase of sustainable fish products compared to the base price. Instead, the independent variables refer to the credence attributes for the same products. The results of the estimated regression model show that Origin has significantly influenced consumers' WTP in the past studies while other attributes are not statistically significant. The estimate of the econometric model highlights the greater attention paid by the consumer to origin, representing the credence attributes for sustainable fish product most appreciated by the consumer (Table 3).The independent variables used in the model estimation (Table 2), have concerned the credence attributes for sustainable fish products (organic, country of origin, eco-labels, animal welfare, wild caught fish and line-caught fish) and the Countries analysed in the model (China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom and USA).

        <p>The eco-label best known to consumers is the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) label. The MSC is the international program for the certification of sustainable and well-managed fisheries, aiming at a standard of sustainability and, consequently, eco-labelling [59]. The MSC label certifies fisheries according to three principles: sustainable fish stocks (i.e., avoiding overfishing), minimizing environmental impact (e.g., limiting destructive fishing gear and by-catch), and effective management. Nowadays, the MSC represents one of the most popular eco-certifications in the fish industry, providing relevant information to consumers, with the aim of having consumers purchase fish products from fisheries whose management is certified as sustainable [40]. Several studies investigated the role of MSC eco-certification in consumer choices of sustainable fish. According to previous studies, consumers show a positive perception of the MSC certification and are willing to pay a premium price for this type of eco-label.The eco-label best known to consumers is the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) label.

        <p>Uchida et al. [35] used a second price auction in order to investigate Japanese consumers' willingness to pay for MSC-labelled fish products. The authors found that when consumers are provided information on both the status of fish stocks and the benefit of the MSC program, a premium ranging from 14.4% to 25.8% for MSC eco-labelled salmon was paid. Interestingly, they also discovered that when only information about the purpose of MSC program was provided, i.e., without simultaneously providing information about the need for the MSC program, this was not sufficient to generate a statistically significant premium for the MSC label.Uchida et al.

        <p>Asche et al. [36], using a unique dataset of prices in UK supermarket chains, conducted a study in order to investigate whether pricing varies across different eco-labels and to what extent different retailers charge different prices. The authors found that there is a premium price for eco-labels. In particular, the MSC label received an average price premium of 13.1% for MSC-labelled salmon. The MSC premium is very close to the 14.2% reported for Alaska Pollock by Roheim et al. [30] and the 10% and 12% reported for haddock and whitefish, respectively, by Sogn-Grundvåg et al. [33,34]. However, the results show that eco-label price premiums vary across retail chains. Specifically, MSC-labelled salmon has a high premium in low-end retail chains but no statistically significant premium in high-end chains.Asche et al.

        <p>Lim et al. [39], in a study carried out in the USA, found that consumers are willing to pay a 29% premium price for MSC-labelled canned tuna.

        <p>In response to this situation, an alternative way to preserve the supply of wild-caught fish has been proposed, i.e., aquacultures or farm-raised fish [61]. It is worth noting that the benefits of aquacultures include a lower cost and year-round availability, compared to wild-caught fish [62]. However, according to previous studies, consumers prefer wild-caught fish due to the higher quality perception, better taste [63], and absence of negative environment impacts, which characterize aquaculture practice [61].In response to this situation, an alternative way to preserve the supply of wild-caught fish has been proposed, i.e., aquacultures or farm-raised fish [61].

        <p>The study carried out in the USA by Davidson et al. [19] analyzed Hawaiin consumers' willingness to pay for farmed vs. wild-caught attributes, using a conjoint analysis of four different fish species (tuna, salmon, tilapia, and moi pacific threadfin). The respondents cited taste as the most important reason for preferring wild-caught fish production to both land-based and marine-based aquaculture production. Concern about the use of natural resources is a driver for some respondents in purchasing wild-caught fish and the main driver for other respondents in purchasing fish from marine aquaculture production. Of the 17 respondents who preferred land-based aquacultures, six favored it because of taste preferences, and five participants were concerned about environmental pollution from other production methods. The authors found that Hawaiian consumers are willing to pay an overall relevant premium price for wild-caught fish over the farm-raised option. In particular, they showed a willingness to pay a 55.8% premium price for wild-caught salmon and 63.5% and 25.4% for wild-caught tuna and moi, respectively. According to the results, wild-caught fish products are preferred over farm-raised fish mainly for its better taste among Hawaiian consumers, as was previously found by O'Dierno et al. [63].The study carried out in the USA by Davidson et al.

        <p>The premium price found for wild fish products confirms that consumers place a high value on maintaining wild fish stocks. The adoption of appropriate initiatives to promote and develop the sector is an advantage for both fishermen and fish farmers.

        <p>Products labelled as sustainable or responsibly sourced, as in the case of "line-caught" fish, represent one of the most important sustainable techniques, with a low environmental impact. In the last decade, consumer concerns about the state of fish stocks and how fish have been captured, among different capturing methods, has been growing [33,34]. Nevertheless, despite the importance of this attribute, there appears to have been little research on this topic and small price premiums for fish products marketed as responsibly sourced, such as the line-caught attribute.Products labelled as sustainable or responsibly sourced, as in the case of "line-caught" fish, represent one of the most important sustainable techniques, with a low environmental impact.

        <p>The first study in the literature to investigate whether the line-caught attribute commands any price premium at the supermarket level of the value chain was carried out by Sogn-Grundvåg et al. [33]. The analysis was based on weekly observations of chilled pre-packed cod and haddock in seven different supermarkets in the UK. The results of the study highlighted that "line-caught" cod and haddock received a price premium of 18% and 10%, respectively.The first study in the literature to investigate whether the line-caught attribute commands any price premium at the supermarket level of the value chain was carried out by Sogn-Grundvåg et al.

        <p>The WTP estimates show that consumers are willing to pay premiums for domestic products simply because they are local [64]. In several studies, the more significant effects on consumer choice derives from the country of origin label. According to the results, the general pattern shows that the origin was found to be the most important attribute in consumer choices and received the highest price premium [39,48,49]; in particular, local products are the preferred choices [19,23,32,35,39,48,49].The WTP estimates show that consumers are willing to pay premiums for domestic products simply because they are local [64].

        <p>The importance of country of origin preferences might be due to several factors. Consumers perceive fish and seafood as highly perishable products, compared to other agro-food products, and they value the freshness attribute more than any other quality attribute. Therefore, a shorter transportation distance of products plays an important role not only in relation to environmental impact, but also in relation to consumer preferences regarding local fish products [65]. Additionally, some geographical areas have unique and typical conditions due to the local environment or typical processing traditions, which cause product quality to be particularly valued and considered in fish markets. Furthermore, consumers are worried about the safety of fish products, especially when products are imported from foreign countries, where food regulations are perceived to be inadequate [66]. The results in the literature indicated a high percentage of price premiums for local fish products, compared to imported alternatives, because of food safety issues [67]. Other reasons for consumer preferences regarding the origin of fish products could be that more trust is placed in local products or the ethnocentrism of consumers [68].The importance of country of origin preferences might be due to several factors.

        <p>The results also show that consumers are concerned about animal welfare [23]. Several studies have indicated that consumers have a positive perception and willingness to pay a slight premium price for improved fish welfare [18] and also to avoid by-catch, preferring the eco-label, "turtle safe" [19,22].The results also show that consumers are concerned about animal welfare [23].

        <p>With regard to organic labels, studies in the literature identify a positive organic price premium for fish products in general. However, despite the fact that the organic attribute is appreciated by consumers, it does not play a major role in consumer choices of fish products, compared with other attributes, such as the country of origin label. This result is possibly due to the fact that consumers probably perceive fish and seafood as products that are definitely healthy and thus do not evaluate the residues of chemical feed additives used in aquaculture practice. However, organic labels receive a higher WTP, compared to eco-labels. One possible explanation for this might be that organic labels are well recognized, and consumers understand them, while they may have less knowledge on specific fish eco-labels, like the MSC. This can be backed up by the finding of Grunert et al. [70], who found that most consumers only have a limited use of sustainability labels, which might well include the well-known organic label and exclude specific fish labels, like MSC.With regard to organic labels, studies in the literature identify a positive organic price premium for fish products in general.

        <p>Based on the results, in several studies, the effect of certification is shown to be relevant when presenting information about the meaning and the consequence of specific certifications, since this information is shown to increase the WTP.Based on the results, in several studies, the effect of certification is shown to be relevant when presenting information about the meaning and the consequence of specific certifications, since this information is shown to increase the WTP.</p>
        <p>In this regard, it is important to underline that, as indicated by Roheim et al. [30], the price premiums estimated in previous studies should be considered conservatively, as the values could be relatively high due to the hypothetical nature of some of the examined studies. Moreover, the analyzed studies are heterogeneous, because they are characterized by several distinctive features, such as the variety of products analyzed, year and countries where the studies were carried out, attributes included in the experiment, and technical characteristics of the samples. Therefore, in general, the amounts need to be considered as simple indicators of the relative importance of each analyzed attribute.In this regard, it is important to underline that, as indicated by Roheim et al.

        <p>One of the most interesting results is the impact of the country of origin attribute in consumer fish choice, which receives the highest premium price. This can be explained by the fact that consumers prefer local over imported food [71]. Therefore, we suggest that producers invest in the local market and highlight the origin of the fish product on the package.One of the most interesting results is the impact of the country of origin attribute in consumer fish choice, which receives the highest premium price.

        <p>The WTP estimated in the literature shows the importance that consumers place on externalities related to the environment, considering that they are willing to pay a premium price for sustainably sourced products. Thus, producers that use alternative production methods that somehow reduce the contamination of the environment should explicitly add this information to the product labels, even if the information is already implied by a certification, because consumers may pay premiums for this extra information.The WTP estimated in the literature shows the importance that consumers place on externalities related to the environment, considering that they are willing to pay a premium price for sustainably sourced products.

        <p>Consumers can use this information to change their purchasing choices towards a more sustainable behavior [72].

        <p>Gutiérrez and Morgan [74] stress that sustainability issues should motivate consumers in their purchasing choices, but they should not become a complex matter for them. They should have a default buying specification concerning sustainable fish, in which they can trust. Following this vision regarding the implementation of the sustainable food system approach (capacities for change), it is critical to put in place, within a coherent policy framework, concerted actions of governmental and market-based providers and innovative groups of citizen-consumers [75]. These policy interventions include information-based instruments.Gutiérrez and Morgan [74] stress that sustainability issues should motivate consumers in their purchasing choices, but they should not become a complex matter for them.

        <p>With sustainability labels, responsibility for sustainable fish is being transferred from governments, producers, and retailers to consumers. Instead of governments regulating the sales of sustainable fish or retailers implementing sustainable fish, only policies [76], governments, retailers, and NGOs provide information to consumers. Consumers are expected to be aware of their responsibility and act responsibly through their decision-making at the point of purchase [77]. The environmental responsibility ascribed to the individual consumer has become part of mainstream policy-making, and the use of labels is regarded as an essential policy tool in this connection. Therefore, for a sustainable fish strategy to be successful, consumers need to be aware of the impact of their fish consumption and willing to take responsibility for their fish choices.With sustainability labels, responsibility for sustainable fish is being transferred from governments, producers, and retailers to consumers.

        <p>Nowadays, the industry has developed several transnational certification and labelling schemes to foster sustainable fisheries and to inform consumers and key stakeholders of the value chain. Retailers have a vantage position in the food chain and play a powerful role both downstream, having a closer relation to consumers at the point of sale, and upstream at the purchase level in controlling the activities of producers. Retailers can also promote sustainable fish practices by ensuring that their products are sourced from sustainable fisheries and fish farms.Nowadays, the industry has developed several transnational certification and labelling schemes to foster sustainable fisheries and to inform consumers and key stakeholders of the value chain.

        <p>With regard to the limitations of this study, we highlight that, due to the restricted number of studies analyzed, the results should be generalized with caution. In addition, future research should focus on more fish species and countries in order to gain a better understanding of the current trends. Moreover, while there is evidence of price premiums in the retail market for sustainability-labelled fish products, there are very few studies examining the existence of price premiums at the producer level.With regard to the limitations of this study, we highlight that, due to the restricted number of studies analyzed, the results should be generalized with caution.
