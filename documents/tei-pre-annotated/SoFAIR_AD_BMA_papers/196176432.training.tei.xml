        <p>The study of disaster and immediate post-disaster response is increasingly becoming an important area of study. There is evidence that situational entrepreneurial endeavours can positively influence regional development and country competitiveness (Miles et al., 2016;Zhang Lindell &amp; Prater, 2009). Small business recovery requires entrepreneurs in the locality to deal with the immediate aftermath of disasters. In examining small business post-disaster recovery, the authors found that Entrepreneurial Marketing (EM) offers a helpful body of research in explaining the findings of this study. For example, Schindehutte, Morris &amp; Kuratko (2000) found that crises often compel businesses to adopt an entrepreneurial approach to their marketing function while Morrish (2011) argue that EM strategies are useful in times of market turbulence and uncertainty.The study of disaster and immediate post-disaster response is increasingly becoming an important area of study.

        <p>The risk of disruptive occurrences is ubiquitous (Burnard &amp; Bharma, 2011) and there is increased global research interest focusing on disaster recovery following catastrophic events. This is generally with the aim of future-proofing communities against destruction by creating resilient communities. Disaster studies have covered topics such as community recovery, resilience and social capital in relation to disasters (Aldrich, 2011;Aldrich &amp; Meyer, 2015;Norris, Stevens, Pfefferbaum, Wyche &amp; Pfefferbaum, 2008). A disaster study in this journal [JBR] investigated the retail environment (Liu, Black, Lawrence &amp; Garrison, 2012).The risk of disruptive occurrences is ubiquitous (Burnard &amp; Bharma, 2011) and there is increased global research interest focusing on disaster recovery following catastrophic events.

        <p>Business recovery following disaster is also a growing area of interest (Aldrich, 2011;Dahlhamer &amp; Tierney, 1998) which includes development of new resilience measures and factors for enterprise recovery (Stevenson, Brown, Seville &amp; Vargo, 2018;Battisti &amp; Deakins, 2017;Hall, Malinen, Vosslamber &amp; Wordsworth, 2016;Brown, Stevenson, Giovinazzi, Seville &amp; Vargo, 2015). These studies provide vital information on small business recovery, although they are generally strategic and broad-based in nature and usually assess business survival and failure against key factors such as government support. Whilst these studies are valuable, there is a significant gap in the literature relating to recovery strategies that smaller business entrepreneurs employ.

        <p>In an entrepreneurial context, what does the process of entrepreneurial post-disaster recovery entail? What role does marketing play in this context? There are limited studies that explain the process of recovery at this level, and even fewer in-depth studies that explain how successful entrepreneurial activity can make a significant difference between business survival and failure. With the exception of Miles et al. (2016), no other study has investigated EM in a disaster context. Such basic firm survival may depend on an entrepreneur's adoption of a particular range of activities and processes. Currently little is known about this phenomenon therefore this study adopted a 'theories-in-use' approach (Eggers &amp; McCabe, 2016) being useful for "developing new operational definitions, developing a propositional inventory and constructing a comprehensive framework for directing future research" (Kohli &amp; Jaworski, 1990, p. 1).In an entrepreneurial context, what does the process of entrepreneurial post-disaster recovery entail?

        <p>The paper first presents the method and draws from post-disaster business recovery literature to position the study. This is followed by an explanation of the research strategy and data collection process. The findings are based on the field work which involved gathering information on the experiences of 12 entrepreneurs whose businesses have successfully recovered after a devastating earthquake. This discovery-orientated approach (Deshpande 1983;Mahrer, 1988) follows the qualitative, practitioner-based approaches used by Parasuraman, Zeithmal and Berry (1985) and Kohli and Jaworski (1990). In this study, field interview data was collected then compared with extant EM theory. This provided a congruence of EM-related concepts in respect of the postdisaster business recovery process. A discussion then follows that highlights the key EM theory that (post data collection), informs the new theoretical concepts in relation to the postdisaster recovery process. In light of this study, the paper then offers a new EM definition, a set of research propositions and an EM post-disaster business recovery framework to aid future research. The paper concludes with recommendations for further post-disaster business recovery research.The paper first presents the method and draws from post-disaster business recovery literature to position the study.

        <p>While research has been conducted in relation to post-disaster recovery in communities (Aldrich, 2011) and (more broadly) across business regions (Guion, et al., 2007) there is still limited understanding about entrepreneurial and small business recovery. Academic and policy research is generally devoted to post-disaster resilience of households, infrastructure and entire communities based on aggregated data (such as regional economies) rather than on individual firms (Webb, Tierney &amp; Dahlhamer, 2002). Marshall and Schrank (2014, p. 597) lament that "exogenous, non-normative shocks to small businesses such as natural disasters have been understudied", while Webb et al. (2000) suggest systematic documentation of effective recovery strategies rather than snapshots at one point in time, before advocating particular programs and approaches.While research has been conducted in relation to post-disaster recovery in communities (Aldrich, 2011) and (more broadly) across business regions (Guion, et al., 2007) there is still limited understanding about entrepreneurial and small business recovery.

        <p>Entrepreneurship studies have so far focussed on uncertain environments (Haynie, Shepherd, Mosakowski &amp; Earley, 2010;McGrath &amp; MacMillan, 2000), the effect of self-efficacy (Mauer, Neergard &amp; Linstad, 2017), and entrepreneurial opportunity (Ardichvili, Cardozo &amp; Ray, 2003;Baron, 2006;Sarasvathy, Dew, Velamuri &amp; Venkataraman, 2003). While Aldrich and Meyer (2015) and Chamlee-Wright and Storr (2008) advocate social capital (both bonding and bridging) as a critical resource and, the fostering of social infrastructures and social entrepreneurship to promote faster disaster recovery post-disaster. Dahlhamer and Tierney (1998) argue that business recovery can be predicted firstly in the short term by identifying effects of direct physical impact, on business operations, ecological aspects and neighbourhood location of the business. Secondly, in the long-term by age and financial condition of the business. This includes; the economic sector in which a business operates, the scope of its primary market, direct and indirect disaster impacts (e.g. physical damage, forced closure, and disruption of operations) and owner perceptions of the broader economic climate all affect business recovery (Webb et al., 2002;Miles, et al., 2016).Entrepreneurship studies have so far focussed on uncertain environments (Haynie, Shepherd, Mosakowski &amp; Earley, 2010;McGrath &amp; MacMillan, 2000), the effect of self-efficacy (Mauer, Neergard &amp; Linstad, 2017), and entrepreneurial opportunity (Ardichvili, Cardozo &amp; Ray, 2003;Baron, 2006;Sarasvathy, Dew, Velamuri &amp; Venkataraman, 2003).

        <p>With respect to specific sectors, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that provide postdisaster assistance often overlook sectors like tourism (despite its economic importance), and focus on traditional livelihoods such as agriculture and fishing as in the case in Sri Lanka (Robinson &amp; Jarvie, 2008). Another sector often hard-hit by sudden natural disasters is the retail sector. Liu et al. (2012) found that despite negative perceptions of customers following damage to stores from Hurricane Katrina and suffering financial hardship, retailers survived with individual coping self-efficacy. These factors also influenced individuals' satisfaction with living conditions alluding to the importance of ensuring positive outcomes for individuals and communities when disaster strikes (Guion et al., 2007).With respect to specific sectors, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that provide postdisaster assistance often overlook sectors like tourism (despite its economic importance), and focus on traditional livelihoods such as agriculture and fishing as in the case in Sri Lanka (Robinson &amp; Jarvie, 2008).

        <p>Location and space are important considerations as business operations come to a halt when premises are damaged and inaccessible. As a response, authorities will often designate a new business zone where displaced businesses can relocate. There are varying degrees of success reported. A longitudinal study tracked businesses relocating to a new designated business district after the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008. The new business spaces attracted less than half those invited and declined over the next four years (Huang, Wang, &amp; Song, 2018). In Turkey, Orhan (2016) evidenced that post-disaster government planning actually hampered the recovery process. This led to calls for a more coherent spatial strategy for both households and businesses. Although in their study Webb et al. (2002) report that previous disaster experience and level of disaster preparedness do not necessarily positively affect the longterm viability of a business.Location and space are important considerations as business operations come to a halt when premises are damaged and inaccessible.

        <p>Access to resources, especially capital, helps businesses recover following a disaster. For some sectors, capital may not be sufficient. This includes sectors relying on supply chains that get disrupted post-disaster. De Mel, McKenzie and Woodruff (2011) identified that randomly allocated financial grants helped to recover profit levels in Sri Lankan microenterprises following the 2004 tsunami. However, Webb et al. (2002) suggest that the use of external aid does not significantly affect the long-term economic viability of businesses. This is often the case in the United States, where targeted business aid did not appear to help, seemingly creating further problems, including higher debt (Dahlhamer &amp; Tierney, 1998). Despite common assumptions that disasters result in business failures and bankruptcies on a large scale, Webb et al. (2000) argue most businesses do in fact recover following disasters. Thus, it is important to investigate the factors that mitigate risk and facilitate preparedness to enable businesses to respond to the challenges that disasters create on the road to recovery.Access to resources, especially capital, helps businesses recover following a disaster.

        <p>The aim of the study was to investigate how entrepreneurs responded to severe business disruption and new post-disaster environments. The complex nature of the research phenomenon requires inductive enquiry to allow investigation into the thoughts, feelings, actions and behaviours of the selected entrepreneurs. Pre-existing theory on disaster recovery in small businesses and, the disaster recovery process as it relates to the individual entrepreneur is very limited. Therefore, adopting a qualitative research using a 'theories-inuse' approach (Eggers &amp; McCabe, 2016;Zaltman, LeMasters, &amp; Heffring, 1982) was deemed appropriate.The aim of the study was to investigate how entrepreneurs responded to severe business disruption and new post-disaster environments.

        <p>This approach combines data collection, analysis and research evaluation of in-depth interviews and other field data together with existing theories to identify conceptual themes (Eggers &amp; McCabe, 2016;Kohli &amp; Jaworski, 1990;Parasuraman et al., 1985;Zaltman et al., 1982). Strauss and Corbin (1998) advocate this method as useful for inductive, contextspecific research. Interviews took place at the entrepreneur's business premises using openended questions from a semi-structured interview protocol (Carson, Gilmore, Perry, &amp; Gronhaug, 2001). The questions were intended as prompts and to elicit personal reflections and post-quake experiences related to their business.This approach combines data collection, analysis and research evaluation of in-depth interviews and other field data together with existing theories to identify conceptual themes (Eggers &amp; McCabe, 2016;Kohli &amp; Jaworski, 1990;Parasuraman et al., 1985;Zaltman et al., 1982).

        <p>The sample comprised of hospitality businesses with the focus of the study being the entrepreneur, noting that entrepreneurship and strategy is of great relevance to the hospitality sector (Seilov, 2015). The chosen context is earthquake-hit Canterbury in New Zealand that has a prevalence of small privately-owned hospitality businesses within the main impact zone in the Christchurch Central Business District (CBD). The earthquakes and aftershocks the region endured throughout 2010 and 2011 led to the loss of many buildings and basic infrastructure and consequently affected many hospitality businesses immensely. Despite this, the local economy responded well and (with the exception of the tourism sector that lost major attractions, visitors, and accommodation) businesses recovered quickly (Parker &amp; Steenkamp, 2012). New Zealand relies on a small business economy and therefore provides an appropriate sector and context of a disaster-hit region.The sample comprised of hospitality businesses with the focus of the study being the entrepreneur, noting that entrepreneurship and strategy is of great relevance to the hospitality sector (Seilov, 2015).

        <p>The Canterbury region took the brunt of the major seismic events from September 2010 to December 2011. The first quake (7.1 on the Richter scale) triggered thousands of aftershocks (over 13,000 by mid-2014) and a number of major earthquakes. The quake on 22 February 2011 with the epicentre directly beneath the Christchurch CBD struck at a very shallow depth of five kilometres. Although only 6.3 in magnitude, the peak ground acceleration of 2.2g was a world record (quadruple that of the Haiti earthquake). This impact had catastrophic results and still felt today. It caused severe damage to 50% of CBD offices, housing and heritage sites and sadly 185 lives were lost from the collapse of buildings. The CBD was immediately cordoned-off and inner city businesses had to relocate. There was significant damage to key infrastructure interrupting water and sewerage, power supply, roads, public transport, and educational systems. Overall, about 3,000 businesses and 50,000 employees were displaced but able to relocate. It took over six months for a third of the CBD businesses to re-start operations.The Canterbury region took the brunt of the major seismic events from September 2010 to December 2011.

        <p>Over 100,000 residential houses required repairs, rebuilding or demolition, resulting in a large-scale urban relocation. The Earthquake Commission (EQC) received about 400,000 insurance claims. The majority of claims were settled to timescale however rebuilding and repairs of homes and infrastructure are still on-going today. Statistics New Zealand estimated that Christchurch's population decreased by approximately 3.5% from June 2010 to June 2012 (Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA), 2014). Now, the population has largely recovered with new employment opportunities created by a $NZ40 billion postdisaster rebuild (Reserve Bank of New Zealand, 2016), attracting thousands of new workers into the region. With the changing population and landscape, entrepreneurs who remained in the city had to navigate many opportunities and challenges as they embarked on the road to recovery.Over 100,000 residential houses required repairs, rebuilding or demolition, resulting in a large-scale urban relocation.

        <p>The study reveals a number of critical impacts on businesses in the immediate aftermath ranging from moderate to severe. The overarching challenge for those in the CBD was that all businesses within the zone closed down; the perimeter was designated a 'red-zone' and cordoned off. Businesses that relocated to the suburbs reported major negative impact on their trade, which threatened their survival. Immediate effects included loss of employees, customers and suppliers, resulting in drastically reduced revenues and escalating costs.The study reveals a number of critical impacts on businesses in the immediate aftermath ranging from moderate to severe.

        <p>Another challenge experienced by several participants was attraction and retention of staff as many hospitality employees left the city. Recruiting a capable workforce became extremely difficult and training new employees in a time of chaos and uncertainty is costly and time intensive. Fortunately, national and local government subsidies were available to small businesses and this helped struggling businesses pay staff wages while they were trying to get their business back on track.Another challenge experienced by several participants was attraction and retention of staff as many hospitality employees left the city.

        <p>The personal and mental health of the entrepreneurs affected their own well-being and resilience in the aftermath of the disaster. This was challenging for entrepreneurs as they went through a process of acceptance and had to move forward. Others took time to re-evaluate their personal and career direction.

Debt levels and damage to homes impacted negatively on the well-being of these entrepreneurs. Increased stress caused relationship breakdowns and further financial pressure but despite the adversity, these entrepreneurs showed personal and emotional resilience.The personal and mental health of the entrepreneurs affected their own well-being and resilience in the aftermath of the disaster.

        <p>Entrepreneurs in this study decided to continue operating their business from another location. This is not a decision taken lightly considering the associated hazards and risks. The participants exhibited higher levels of entrepreneurial self-efficacy and belief in their ability to succeed and accomplish the task of restarting their business (Bandura, 1994). An entrepreneur's sense of self-efficacy can play a major role in how they approach goals, tasks, and challenges brought about by events like natural disasters. These entrepreneurs demonstrated resilience and determination to re-open and get back to work. At the outset, they 'ran on adrenalin,' often disregarding their own personal and emotional distress. They described going to extraordinary lengths to please customers. In some cases they passionately pursued speciality products for their customers. To summarise; they resumed because they were passionate about their business, had expertise in their industry, and most importantly, managed to relocate to a safer location.Entrepreneurs in this study decided to continue operating their business from another location.

        <p>These entrepreneurs also displayed opportunity-seeking behaviours using what appeared to be effectual reasoning (what they know) and were highly motivated to continue with the business while adapting to the new business environment. They quickly accepted what was generally referred to by the local Canterbury community as the 'new normal'.

That's kind of my personality type, like when there's a crisis, just get stuck in and do whatever and support everybody else, and then I kind of crash later." Bandura (1994, p. 71) defines perceived self-efficacy "as people's beliefs about their capabilities to produce designated levels of performance that exercise influence over events that affect their lives." Entrepreneurs high in self-efficacy (see Sadri &amp; Robertson, 1993, for an extensive review) have a positive mind-set (Kasouf, Morrish &amp; Miles, 2015) and are motivated enough to find solutions whether in traditional or turbulent settings, including natural disasters. Zhao, Seibert &amp; Hills (2005) found that an individual's entrepreneurial selfefficacy fully mediates previous entrepreneurial experience, and risk propensity on entrepreneurial intentions. Therefore, self-efficacy is an appropriate concept to assist understanding of what is likely to influence entrepreneurial decisions."I'm an optimist in all my life, I'm a big believer of this spiritual law of attraction, you put out positive, positive's going to come back.

        <p>The investigation found that effectual reasoning also influenced entrepreneurial decisionmaking in the post-disaster context. Effectuation is described as a decision-making approach to achieve goals used by expert entrepreneurs through identifying the next best step, by assessing the resources available, while continuously balancing these goals with their resources and actions (Sarasvathy, 2001). Contrary to causal logic, with a predetermined goal and process to achieve it, effectuation is more suited to entrepreneurship processes that are inherently characterised by uncertainties and risks (such as those brought about by natural disasters).The investigation found that effectual reasoning also influenced entrepreneurial decisionmaking in the post-disaster context.

        <p>Effectual thinking uses what available resources the entrepreneur has and combines them in ways to create opportunities with minimal planning, if at all. Guided by a world-view and four fundamental principles, entrepreneurs execute the next best step and adjust direction according to the outcome of their actions (Sarasvathy, 2001). Effectuation re-evaluates the traditional model of business planning and is characterised by means-driven versus goaldriven action; affordable loss versus expected return; partnerships versus competitive analysis; and leveraging as opposed to avoiding contingencies (Dew, Read, Sarasvathy &amp; Wiltbank, 2009).Effectual thinking uses what available resources the entrepreneur has and combines them in ways to create opportunities with minimal planning, if at all.

        <p>Essentially causal reasoning is consistent with theories of planned strategies, whereas effectual reasoning is more in line with ideas of emergent or non-predictive strategy (Mintzberg, 1979). Thus, it is inherently less resource intensive and highlights significance for the present. For these reasons effectual thinking is a good fit for smaller enterprises and entrepreneurs encumbered with a lack of abundant resources (Chandler, DeTienne, McKelvie &amp; Mumford, 2011) especially when facing post-disaster situations.Essentially causal reasoning is consistent with theories of planned strategies, whereas effectual reasoning is more in line with ideas of emergent or non-predictive strategy (Mintzberg, 1979).

        <p>Disasters often disrupt business decisions because they directly influence staff, customers, and suppliers and have wider implications that affect the community and economy as a whole. In disaster settings, the well-being of stakeholders may depend on their ability to carry on with life as normal including the ability to work and earn an income. With the prevalence of small businesses dependent on entrepreneurs, it is important that programmes and strategies for smaller and vulnerable firms especially in less well-prepared sectors (Webb et al., 2000) are designed to support them.Disasters often disrupt business decisions because they directly influence staff, customers, and suppliers and have wider implications that affect the community and economy as a whole.

        <p>The post-disaster situation described above led many business owners to evaluate their options. For example, in the year following the event only 8% of CBD restaurants (Dally, 2012) and cafes managed to relocate and reopen, while a significant number of inner-city restaurants had "simply disappeared" (Dally, 2012). By July 2013, the CBD was 80% closer to pre-quake figures of hospitality businesses. However, more than 350 outlets remained closed (Stylianou &amp; Stewart, 2013). These numbers reflect the dynamic nature of entrepreneurial decision making where some businesses exited the industry (e.g. fail), a significant number delayed reopening for various reasons (wait) and a small number opted to immediately resume business operations.

        <p>The disaster meant instant loss of any opportunity to re-establish operations in the red-zoned CBD. Determined entrepreneurs with businesses in the zone displayed a natural ability to recover, swiftly relocating to the arterial routes outside of the red zone where a majority of the CBD occupants had also relocated. All businesses in this study were able to re-start within a few days to six months after the event, either finding new premises or getting repairs done quickly. Containers converted to cafes became very popular. A container mall in the city centre (with a variety of retail businesses) became the symbol of the business recovery. A number of entrepreneurs took the opportunity to expand to the suburbs thus developing a portfolio of hospitality businesses that complemented their core business.The disaster meant instant loss of any opportunity to re-establish operations in the red-zoned CBD.

        <p>In the long-term, relocation decisions need to be well thought-out and be informed by evidence as highlighted by other existing disaster studies. For example, the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake (Huang et al., 2018) and the Adapazari, Turkish study which resulted in calls for a more coherent spatial strategy (Orhan, 2016). Given the mixed results from these two disaster studies and the evidence presented here, there is a need to further investigate how business sectors and local authorities need to work together to ensure business sector recovery. It is also interesting to note that in Canterbury temporary locations can take on a life of their own. The container mall became a retail and tourist destination with the community resisting moves to close it down when the rebuild took place.In the long-term, relocation decisions need to be well thought-out and be informed by evidence as highlighted by other existing disaster studies.

        <p>Many competitors were unable to access insurance cover and government assistance immediately, causing delays in resuming operations. This offered alert entrepreneurs a first mover advantage. An example from this study included the opportunity to develop a portfolio of hospitality businesses through expanding into the suburbs. Those that were able to repair their premises in situ tried to capture new markets by expanding their capability to cater to a larger customer segment. For example, while strengthening the building from minor structural damage, one business expanded the kitchen to facilitate larger food operations. They moved from serving snacks to catering for hundreds of meals per day and dramatically increasing revenue.Many competitors were unable to access insurance cover and government assistance immediately, causing delays in resuming operations.

        <p>The massive clean-up and rebuild operations brought thousands of construction workers to the CBD and they became a steady source of custom for hospitality operators. As cordons were lifted, people ventured into the CBD once again and new opportunities were available to extend trading after normal hours. Some responded by reshaping their product-service offering and expanding into new customer markets. To capitalise on all-hours custom, some operated as a cafe during the day, and in the evening as a restaurant until 9:00pm after which, the business switched to a bar with live entertainment. This model sometimes involved multiple operators in the shared space where the cafe operator relinquished the space after day trade was over to the restaurant operator, and then, to the bar management after dinner service was finished.The massive clean-up and rebuild operations brought thousands of construction workers to the CBD and they became a steady source of custom for hospitality operators.

        <p>This study draws from two established EM definitions. Morris, Schindehutte and LaForge (2002, p. 5) defines EM as "the proactive identification and exploitation of opportunities for acquiring and retaining profitable customers through innovative approaches to risk management, resource leveraging and value creation". They propose seven underlying EM dimensions that comprise of; proactive orientation, opportunity-driven, customer-intensity, innovation-focused, risk management, resource leveraging and value creation (Morris et al., 2002). Hills et al. (2008, p. 7) define EM as a complex process as well as an orientation for how entrepreneurs behave at the marketplace describing it as "a spirit, an orientation as well as a process of passionately pursuing opportunities and launching and growing ventures that create perceived customer value through relationships by employing innovativeness, creativity, selling, market immersion, networking and flexibility". Morris et al. (2002) differentiate EM from traditional marketing describing the entrepreneur as carrying out marketing in an instinctive, unplanned way as evidenced by the body of research that focus on marketing carried out by entrepreneurs in small firms (Carson, Cromie, McGowan, &amp; Hill, 1995;Stokes, 2000;Sethna et al., 2013). Hills and Hultman (2011) also highlight differences between managerial and entrepreneurial decision-making describing decision-making as fundamental for understanding the basic premise of entrepreneurial marketing and drawing from studies by Bjerke &amp; Hultman (2002) and Schultz &amp; Hofer (1999). Such differences include marketing decisions that are often unplanned, and haphazard with a non-linear vision of marketing actions (Carson et al., 1995;Jones et al., 2017).This study draws from two established EM definitions.

        <p>The coded data when compared with EM theory showed that entrepreneurs in this study exhibited high levels of self-efficacy and effectual reasoning that enabled entrepreneurs to make effective business resumption decisions, which in turn facilitated their direct engagement in a number of entrepreneurial actions to salvage their business. These actions were both remedial and opportunistic in nature. The four main areas of activity and behaviour identified as having congruence with EM theory are opportunity-seeking behaviours, resource organising (controlling rather than leveraging of a firms resources), creating customer value and accepting risk. These findings are first discussed in conjunction with relevant post-disaster business recovery studies where available and with congruent EM theory.The coded data when compared with EM theory showed that entrepreneurs in this study exhibited high levels of self-efficacy and effectual reasoning that enabled entrepreneurs to make effective business resumption decisions, which in turn facilitated their direct engagement in a number of entrepreneurial actions to salvage their business.

        <p>Entrepreneurs exhibited opportunity-focussed behaviour and swiftly engaged in opportunity enactment. Based on their expertise, entrepreneurs quickly developed targeted offerings (as opposed to incremental innovation) to new customers as new segments emerged. With the pressure to restart, businesses raced to find new premises or where the damage was not too severe, get repairs done fast and resourcefully to re-open as soon as possible. The seizing of new opportunities is closely linked to creating and adopting new business models. In order to enable, enact and realize new opportunities, entrepreneurs had to invest in new approaches to operating businesses.Entrepreneurs exhibited opportunity-focussed behaviour and swiftly engaged in opportunity enactment.

        <p>Entrepreneurial opportunity and the recognition of opportunities is described by Eckhardt and Shane (2003) as formulating a profitable conjecture that requires forming expectations, which is not simple. Dimov (2007) describes opportunity as a product in entrepreneurship, emanating from idea plus action, while Sarasvathy, Dew, Velamuri and Venkataraman (2010) identify opportunity as three concepts: new idea/s or invention/s, beliefs and actions. Here they propose that new ideas or inventions may not necessarily lead to the achievement of economic ends; beliefs are things that favour achievement of possible valuable ends; and, actions generate and implement those ends. Finally, McMullen (2015, p. 657) poignantly observes: "individuals can only believe (not know) that they have recognized entrepreneurial opportunities under uncertainty". Battisti and Deakins (2017) also noted that the firm survival in Christchurch relies on its appreciation of how the firm is connected with customers, suppliers and other businesses in the community. Entrepreneurs therefore are required to understand how they can mobilise and access critical resources, and develop proactive posture and capability to integrate these resources in recognising new opportunities.Entrepreneurial opportunity and the recognition of opportunities is described by Eckhardt and Shane (2003) as formulating a profitable conjecture that requires forming expectations, which is not simple.

        <p>Business recovery in the post-disaster environment was significantly enhanced by the entrepreneurs' ability to retain pre-existing firm resources and take remedial action to secure additional essential assets including human resources. Hospitality businesses require the operator to have premises, food and beverage preparation and serving equipment, access to suppliers and the services of experienced hospitality staff. The entrepreneur must be adept at securing and organising these essential resources. Once a lease to new, or temporary premises are secured, they then need fitting out to comply with new licensing regulations.Business recovery in the post-disaster environment was significantly enhanced by the entrepreneurs' ability to retain pre-existing firm resources and take remedial action to secure additional essential assets including human resources.

        <p>Builders and tradespeople need to be organised and equipment have to be retrieved, repurposed or repaired. With local authorities prioritising repairs and installation of the city's basic infrastructure, construction workers were not easy to come by and if so, their services were at a premium. Consequently, building and remediation projects were delayed or put on hold. Where immediate rebuilding or remedial work was required, entrepreneurs did the work themselves with the help of a network of family, friends and other business owners who willingly traded time and resources to help each other.Builders and tradespeople need to be organised and equipment have to be retrieved, repurposed or repaired.

        <p>Collective effort led by socially conscious and entrepreneurial individuals naturally occurs when disasters strike. Chamlee-Wright and Storr (2010) found that social entrepreneurs performed several key functions post-Katrina. These entrepreneurs collectively helped resolve problems associated with deciding to return and rebuild by organising and engaging in outreach, taking responsibility for activism and advocacy on behalf of their communities and, directly assisting in rebuilding efforts and providing essential services. Interestingly, policy makers and officials can often frustrate this entrepreneurial effort (Chamlee-Wright &amp; Storr, 2010). But, despite the challenges of bureaucracy, entrepreneurs have a mind-set that allows them to rise up in the face of adversity and negate these issues.Collective effort led by socially conscious and entrepreneurial individuals naturally occurs when disasters strike.

        <p>With a changing landscape, entrepreneurs needed to co-create new value for existing customers (retention strategies), new customers, and new markets (market adaption/expansion strategies) with the post-disaster community.

        <p>Crucially, by taking these actions, entrepreneurs created additional societal value through providing vital community spaces in their cafes and restaurants for the community (thus displaying altruistic behaviours). Post-quake businesses adopted flexible business models, whereby the focus was on survival and recovery via cooperative means, creating value for customers and the community. Entrepreneurs collaborated with local charities while others supported customers going through personal trauma where their business provided a sense of normality and became a place for emotional healing. Customers and businesses also volunteered to help other businesses with repair work. This apparent coming together of the community also extended to other stakeholders, for example, developers who provided additional services such as interior decoration and other services. In an effort to build reputation and brand, others adopted targeted operations tagged onto specific post-quake activity such as serving personnel involved in the post-quake clean up.Crucially, by taking these actions, entrepreneurs created additional societal value through providing vital community spaces in their cafes and restaurants for the community (thus displaying altruistic behaviours).

With the rebuild expected to take a number of years, businesses used temporary building structures such as large steel containers, converted buses and caravans, and repurposed carts pending availability of more permanent locations. However, in seizing opportunities, entrepreneurs needed to manage additional risk that they had to mitigate. Risk after a disaster was reduced by immediate remedial action and adept retention of firm resources. It was also prudent for these entrepreneurs to engage and enact business resources and outside agency support.Opportunities were ripe for the taking given a huge spike in demand for cafes, bars and restaurants in the newly formed business districts.

Risk-taking, often used as a measure for entrepreneurial proclivity, includes three aspects: innovativeness, risk taking and pro-activeness (Deshpande, Farley, &amp; Webster, 1993;Matsuno, Mentzer &amp; Ozsomer, 2002). Risk is an EM dimension (Morris et al., 2002;Jones &amp; Rowley, 2011) that is often linked to organizational renewal; can influence changes in the marketplace; and offers the possibility of great customer value (Deshpande et al., 1993;Slater &amp; Narver, 1998).

        <p>The study highlights the potential role of entrepreneurial self-efficacy in the entrepreneur's ability to accept higher than usual levels of risk as they simultaneously engage in opportunity-seeking behaviours. The entrepreneur first perceives the opportunity in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. For these opportunities to be realised, a process of rapid exploitation is required in addition to acknowledging the realities of the post-quake situation and quickly adjusting strategies to a 'new normal.' Whereas EM concepts advocate creation of customer value, in the post-quake setting, entrepreneurs were required to create new stakeholder value within the context of the new business landscape.The study highlights the potential role of entrepreneurial self-efficacy in the entrepreneur's ability to accept higher than usual levels of risk as they simultaneously engage in opportunity-seeking behaviours.

        <p>This study makes a significant contribution in three research domains. Principally, for the study of EM where there is a substantial gap in literature with respect to entrepreneurial decision-making, entrepreneurial action and adoption of EM in post-disaster environments.This study makes a significant contribution in three research domains.

        <p>Second, very few post-disaster studies adopt the entrepreneur as the focus of study, or, have the microelements of small firm survival been a subject of investigation. Finally, while business recovery has focussed on enterprise survival, much of this body of research fails to investigate the role and importance of entrepreneurs in business recovery in specific sectors and regions.Second, very few post-disaster studies adopt the entrepreneur as the focus of study, or, have the microelements of small firm survival been a subject of investigation.

        <p>In presenting this study the authors acknowledge the study's limitations. These include the fact that findings are based on a small study in one industry sector and in one city. That said, the intention was to investigate deeper more meaningful insights into entrepreneurial recovery post-disaster by getting close to the research phenomenon and foci of study. The study has allowed for elucidation of new insights concerning the entrepreneur's post-disaster business recovery decisions, actions and processes as they relate to EM. It has enabled provision of a new framework useful for adoption in further qualitative studies and a useful set of propositions which can support future quantitative research for wider generalizable studies.In presenting this study the authors acknowledge the study's limitations.

        <p>The authors anticipate that the EMPDBR framework will encourage researchers to continue investigating post-disaster business recovery from an EM perspective. Future studies can compare entrepreneurial decision-making and EM between westernised countries and in developing regions where entrepreneurs are likely to face greater business survival challenges such as lack of government support, insurance cover, coherent disaster recovery plan, and adequate infrastructure to support these elements. Additionally, the configuration of EM behaviours identified here warrant further examination and testing in different settings and sectors. For example, the tourism and hospitality industry suffer immediate impact with the loss of basic infrastructure, inability to access tourist destinations, foreign government travel advisories, and booking cancellations. Rescue activities also prevent tourism businesses from re-starting operations. In addition, negative and inaccurate media reports and repeated exposure of disaster images create challenges for the industry. It is particularly disastrous for small and developing economies heavily reliant on tourism revenue to survive. For these reasons, and for economic and social recovery to successfully take place post-disaster, further investigations are urgently required to shed more light on post-disaster business recovery.The authors anticipate that the EMPDBR framework will encourage researchers to continue investigating post-disaster business recovery from an EM perspective.
