        <p>Although prior research explored the main motivations of consumer remanufactured behaviour, there is a lack of investigation that explains the complexity of remanufactured consumption behaviour. Based on the complexity theory, our study developed an integrated model to explore factors affecting consumers to purchase remanufactured products. FsQCA was utilised to analyse the collected data. The findings indicated that there are six solutions that can lead to high level of remanufactured behaviour. The necessary condition analysis revealed that moral obligation, moral accountability, perceived risk, perceived risk, and cost knowledge are necessary antecedents for consumers' behaviour to purchase remanufactured products. This study provides remanufacturer and retailers with meaningful practical implications to promote remanufactured consumption.Although prior research explored the main motivations of consumer remanufactured behaviour, there is a lack of investigation that explains the complexity of remanufactured consumption behaviour.

        <p>Retailers are under increased customers pressures to adopt sustainable practises (Foerstl et al., 2015), and as a result, academics and industry leaders are working together to better understand and implement a variety of supply chain initiatives (Liu et al., 2018). However, retailers will only benefit from such an initiative if customers are willing to buy products derived from it (Guide and Van Wassenhove, 2009). Governments, businesses, and customers are working together in an effort to reduce environmental damage because of environmental concerns, such as waste generation and the scarcity of resources (e.g., Dhir et al., 2021;Mahardika et al., 2020). An increasing number of "closed-loop" approaches, whereby flow of rejected products are diverted into new semi-finished products that then stimulate the emergence of new business models like the "Circular Economy" (Abdelmoety et al., 2022;Confente et al., 2020), has resulted in this pressing need (e.g., Mir, 2008). It is critical to determine whether such reversal cycles can be translated into a profitable and long-lasting business (Bodhanwala and Bodhanwala, 2018;Moeller et al., 2011). Since the "Circular Economy" (Foroughi et al., 2022) was first proposed, many governments around the world have been experimenting with various policy options to make it work economically for the environment (Foroughi et al., 2022). Circular economy policies have been implemented in a number of countries, including Germany, Japan, and China (Confente et al., 2020).Retailers are under increased customers pressures to adopt sustainable practises (Foerstl et al., 2015), and as a result, academics and industry leaders are working together to better understand and implement a variety of supply chain initiatives (Liu et al., 2018).

        <p>Remanufacturing is one of the concepts that may close the supply chain and lead to sustainability (Singhal et al., 2019). As the name suggests, this is done by converting a product that is nearing the end of its life and is no longer supported by the manufacturer into a new product that carries the same warranty as the original (Van Nguyen et al., 2020). In the remanufacturing process, the returned product is disassembled, the parts are cleaned and sorted properly, the parts are refurbished, and some new parts may be procured and finally reassembled and tested for quality (Aboul-Dahab et al., 2021;Liang et al., 2009). Production strategies that aim to recover residual value from used goods by refurbishing, replacing, or reusing components so that the final product is restored to a like-new condition are known as remanufacturing ( Östlin et al., 2009;Sarkar et al., 2022). Remanufacturing has the potential to provide retailers with economic, social, and environmental benefits as an essential component of the circular economy (Liang et al., 2009). As an example, remanufactured products have the following advantages over new ones: they use up to 70% less raw materials, produce up to 80% fewer emissions, use up to 60% less energy, and have up to 50% lower total production costs (Hunka et al., 2021).Remanufacturing is one of the concepts that may close the supply chain and lead to sustainability (Singhal et al., 2019).

        <p>Research on remanufactured products has focused on operational, managerial, and strategic dimensions, including the issue of quality (Govindan et al., 2019), and then on production dimensions, such as the implementation of reverse logistics and waste management processes (Agag, 2019;Zhao et al., 2022). Customers are crucial to the successful implementation of remanufacturing, but they have received insufficient attention. Customers' attitudes toward remanufactured products, for example, may be more favourable if society as a whole promotes their use (Ferrer and Swaminathan, 2006). Remanufactured products are more appealing to customers when they are promoted in this way (Agag et al., 2022;Gaur et al., 2015). A research challenge was to determine how remanufactured products are perceived by consumers. Therefore, this study aims to find out what influences consumers' decisions to buy remanufactured products.Research on remanufactured products has focused on operational, managerial, and strategic dimensions, including the issue of quality (Govindan et al., 2019), and then on production dimensions, such as the implementation of reverse logistics and waste management processes (Agag, 2019;Zhao et al., 2022).

        <p>In the context of remanufacturing, attention has been given to variables affecting customers' behaviour to purchase remanufactured products by exploring the linear, symmetrical modelling, and net effect of antecedents on behaviours, but without interpreting the complexity of customers' behaviours (Singhal et al., 2019). Concentrating on symmetric and net effects can be misguided, as these do not impact on all cases in the dataset, meaning the link between two variables is probably not going to be symmetric (Olya and Nia, 2021). Moreover, exploring net effect does not offer rigorous outcomes on the complex processes behind customers' behaviours (Alsuwaidi et al., 2022). Previous studies have ignored the fact that customers' behaviours are unlikely to change until the complex predictors of their behaviour reaches a tipping point (Olya and Nia, 2021). To address this research gap, this study uses complexity theory to explore the interactions of factors influencing customers' behaviours to buy remanufactured products, taking demographic, ethical, and knowledge factors into account. Complexity theory enables us to gain profound insights into the interactions of specific causal antecedents because it is predicated on the premise that single driver is incapable of adequately predicting an outcome (Pappas and Woodside, 2021). Therefore, complexity theory is an appropriate lens through which to investigate the links between outcome conditions and causal drivers, particularly in a complex environment like retailing, where stakeholder interdependence and dynamic processes influence behaviour (Farmaki et al., 2022). According to Pappas et al. (2016), "Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis" (
            <rs type="software">fsQCA</rs>) was used to analyse the data, which enables the exploration of causal recipes (i.e., "the predictors' combinational effects"), and "Necessary Condition Analysis" (NCA), which enables the identification of the factors considered necessary to attain customers' behaviour to buy remanufactured products.

        <p>In order to maintain a circular economy, remanufacturing has many advantages. Because it uses less material and energy, it has the added benefit of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases (Ma et al., 2020). The carbon footprint of remanufacturing turbine blades using the laser direct deposition technique is lower than the carbon footprint of manufacturing a new one (Han et al., 2020). This can be done with seven to eleven additional units using the same amount of energy and material that was originally used in manufacturing (Ullah et al., 2021). Customers prefer remanufactured products because of these environmental advantages (Hunka et al., 2021). Since less material and labour are required, remanufacturing is also a more affordable option. Newly manufactured products cost between 40% and 80% more to remanufacture (Heydari and Ghasemi, 2018). As a result, remanufactured products are more likely to be purchased because of their low prices (Agag et al., 2020;Chakraborty et al., 2019). Another theory is that offering price reductions to customers makes remanufactured goods more appealing (Agag and Eid, 2019;Zhu et al., 2019).In order to maintain a circular economy, remanufacturing has many advantages.

        <p>Although the market for remanufactured consumer products has generated considerable interest in recent years, it remains open for further investigation. An increased demand for improved empirical understanding and refined analytical models of such products in consumer markets has accompanied this growth (Abbey et al., 2017). Remanufactured products, in contrast to new products, seem to produce perceptions and behaviours that do not fit with the norms of the new product literature, such as a lower quality perception. Although multiple works related to perceptions of new products provide initial guidance on the topics of quality perception, brand effects and behavioural outcomes. For remanufactured products to gain traction, consumers need price reductions, according to recent empirical research (Abbey et al., 2017). Additionally, according to Guide and Li (2010), observed average discounts range between 15 percent and 40 percent, depending on the type of product purchased. According to Guide and Li (2010), when discounts are too large, it can cause nonlinearity in demand curves due to consumers' price-quality concerns, a phenomenon that has been observed in the literature on new products as well, albeit in a different form (Wang et al., 2018).Although the market for remanufactured consumer products has generated considerable interest in recent years, it remains open for further investigation.

        <p>Research on remanufactured products also includes studies on customers perceptions and purchasing intentions, as well as willingness to pay (Alegoz et al., 2021;Sun et al., 2020;Ullah and Sarkar, 2020). Customers purchase intentions and purchase behaviours are strongly linked, according to research using the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) (Ajzen, 2011). Although prior studies have confirmed that the behavioural intentions are a significant variable for actual behaviours, the actual behaviours often varies because customers do not always follow through on the intentions, particularly in unique contexts when presented with options or given restrictions (Neto and Dutordoir, 2020). It is possible that remanufactured products may provide one of these contexts in which intentions are inconsistent with actual behaviours (Ho et al., 2018). It has not been studied to compare the consumer's intention to purchase with their actual purchasing behaviours for remanufactured goods. We fill this research void by focusing on customers' actual behaviour rather than their intentions to purchase remanufactured products, which can aid retailers to develop effective strategies to promote their remanufactured products.Research on remanufactured products also includes studies on customers perceptions and purchasing intentions, as well as willingness to pay (Alegoz et al., 2021;Sun et al., 2020;Ullah and Sarkar, 2020).

        <p>Remanufactured products provide an excellent case study for the general theory of marketing ethics proposed by Hunt and Vitell (2006). Ethical reasoning has been utilised to a variety of consumption settings, including counterfeit goods, recycling shopping bags, organic foods, and digital piracy (Carrington and NevilleWhitwell, 2010;Jacobson et al., 2020). Deontological and teleological evaluations make up the bulk of this theory's framework (Hunt and Vitell, 2006). An action's inherent rightness or wrongness, regardless of the consequences, is what is meant by deontological paradigm. If a behaviour is ethical, advocates argue that it can be judged based on the behaviours' characteristics, regardless of its values or risks (Dimitriou and Ducette, 2018). When considering the potential outcome of actions or behaviours, the teleological evaluation looks at whether the actions are ethical if their outcomes lead to a greater balance between right and wrong (Hunt and Vitell, 2006).Remanufactured products provide an excellent case study for the general theory of marketing ethics proposed by Hunt and Vitell (2006).

        <p>Customers' ethical motivations can be better understood through deontological and teleological paradigms, as using remanufactured products incorporates both deontological and teleological reasoning (Zou and Chan, 2019). This means that customers must weigh the benefits to themselves and society of their product selections. Customers are held accountable for their behaviours not only by virtue of their ability to predict future outcomes, but also by virtue of moral norms and values that assign responsibility to them for their personal and societal obligations (Park et al., 2021). This will allow a various theoretical lens to be used to view the findings, explaining the discrepancies between those of prior studies and demonstrating how customers arrive at their ethical stance in the first place (Pecoraro et al., 2021).Customers' ethical motivations can be better understood through deontological and teleological paradigms, as using remanufactured products incorporates both deontological and teleological reasoning (Zou and Chan, 2019).

        <p>Theories of deontological ethics emphasise the importance of moral obligations, accountability, and outrage in the conduct of individuals (Salam et al., 2022). In order to avoid creating a sense of injustice, moral obligations state that one's actions must be consistent with accepted moral beliefs (Schaltegger and Burritt, 2018). Individuals consider unfairness to be a morally wrong act. As a result, they feel compelled to uphold the moral standards that society has established (Eberhart and Naderer, 2017). An individual's moral obligation is a focused, self-expressive response to a specific problem, rather than a generic approach to the world (Agag and El-Masry, 2016;Salam et al., 2022). When individuals have a positive outlook on moral convictions, they feel a sense of moral obligation (Watkins et al., 2016). An individual has a moral obligation to treat others fairly because all humans have an unspoken agreement to treat each other fairly (Salam et al., 2022). As a result, according to deontological paradigm, fairness is a moral imperative. When customers believe they have a moral obligation to treat others fairly, they are justified in holding a company responsible for any behaviours that negatively impact the physical or mental health of another customer (Agag and El-Masry, 2017;Garay et al., 2017;Kautish et al., 2022). If there is no one to blame, there can be no social justice. As a result, the culpable process is critical to the administration of justice. Consumers decide whether or not they will take action against a consumer based on their fairness in their actions (Agag et al., 2016;Narwal and Nayak, 2019).Theories of deontological ethics emphasise the importance of moral obligations, accountability, and outrage in the conduct of individuals (Salam et al., 2022).

        <p>Anger, irritation, and resentment are all deontic reactions that occur as a result of an individual witnessing injustice (van Dam and van Trijp, 2011). When moral standards are violated, moral outrage can lead to anger, contempt, and a sense of unfairness being perceived (Agag et al., 2019;Salam et al., 2022). The theory of deontological paradigm holds that individuals establish standards for judging whether certain behaviours are morally correct or not (Alsuwaidi et al., 2022;Salam et al., 2022). When an individuals' conduct does not meet those standards, they feel compelled to correct it out of a sense of duty (Cheng et al., 2019). Compliance with moral standards fosters individuals' belief in the restoration of justice (Eid et al., 2019;Salam et al., 2022), and this occurs in two stages: first, the wrongdoer is held accountable for their behaviours, and second, required actions are promoted to punish those who violate them (Salam et al., 2022). Deontological evaluation is based on the belief that individuals and society can be bettered regardless of the consequences of their behaviours (Cheng et al., 2019;Shaalan et al., 2022).Anger, irritation, and resentment are all deontic reactions that occur as a result of an individual witnessing injustice (van Dam and van Trijp, 2011).

        <p>Teleological paradigm, on the other hand, takes into account possible outcomes (Hunt and Vitell, 2006). Proponents stress the importance of examining all possible outcomes before making a decision about whether a particular action is ethical (Hunt and Vitell, 2006). According to the teleologist, an action is ethical if the end result is a better balance between right and wrong. The concept of teleology is widely applied in the sustainable consumption context (Halder et al., 2020). It has been widely discussed as a means of addressing ethical issues during the decision-making process. According to Cheng et al. (2019), Chinese customers have an ethical side when they bring their own shopping bags. Teleological assessment was found to be an important predictor of customers' ethical judgments in favour of green purchasing behaviour (Chang and Chou, 2018;Youssef et al., 2022). Another study found that the prevalence of digital piracy is linked to teleological assessment (Birch et al., 2018;Selim et al., 2022). The importance of teleological assessment in uncovering unethical behaviour was emphasised once again. Considering perceived benefits and risks is an important part of the teleological assessment process. A product, service, or technology's perceived benefits and risks are two of the most important factors in determining its acceptance (Hubert et al., 2018;Wood et al., 2021). The term "benefits" is used to describe the positive results that individuals anticipate as a result of a particular behaviour (Birch et al., 2018). Consumers prefer remanufactured products because of their lower cost and reduced impact on the environment (Bonilla-Priego et al., 2022).

        <p>Product knowledge is defined as a customer's awareness of specific product-related information (Wang and Hazen, 2016). Customers experience and advertising are the two most important sources of product knowledge for customers, but they are not the only ones (Farooque et al., 2019). Customers' buying behaviour is influenced by their product knowledge, and this knowledge can be utilised to determine the product's value and the likelihood of a purchase risk (Wang and Hazen, 2016). In terms of both subjective and objective knowledge, product knowledge can be difficult to separate (Wang and Hazen, 2016). Customers typically gain knowledge of a product's features through their own use of the product. Remanufactured products have a poor reputation among some customers due to their lack of product knowledge (Lin and Chen, 2006). As a result, this investigation is confined to only objective knowledge because of the study setting. These studies focus on "cost knowledge, green knowledge and quality knowledge" as three of the most prominent types of objective product knowledge (Wang et al., 2020).Product knowledge is defined as a customer's awareness of specific product-related information (Wang and Hazen, 2016).

Remanufactured products have a poor reputation among some customers due to their lack of product knowledge (Lin and Chen, 2006). As a result, this investigation is confined to only objective knowledge because of the study setting. These studies focus on "cost knowledge, green knowledge and quality knowledge" as three of the most prominent types of objective product knowledge (Wang et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>Because of its importance in predicting purchase behaviour and achieving a long-term competitive advantage, customers perceptions of value have drawn research and practitioners' attention (Wang and Hazen, 2016). Previous examinations indicated that remanufactured products could have both benefits and sacrifices. The advantages can be divided into two categories: environmental benefits, such as reduced energy consumption and landfill waste; and price advantages compared to new products (Abdulrahman et al., 2015). The perceived quality of remanufactured products as being inferior to new products (Wang et al., 2013) and the perceived risk of purchasing remanufactured products are two other factors that influence the willingness to make sacrifices (Wang et al., 2013). The current research suggests that consumers' perceptions of the value of remanufactured automobile parts may be influenced by these benefits and sacrifices. Even if expected utility theory is violated, prospect theory can still predict individual choices because it characterises cumulative uncertainties (McDermott et al., 2008). Prior examination suggests that expected utility theory may not be sufficient to explain customers reactions to remanufactured products because of value and risk variables that should be taken into account. This is an especially useful lens through which to examine the context of this study (Wang and Hazen, 2016).Because of its importance in predicting purchase behaviour and achieving a long-term competitive advantage, customers perceptions of value have drawn research and practitioners' attention (Wang and Hazen, 2016).

        <p>Customers' understanding of the lower cost of remanufactured products is taken into account when calculating cost knowledge (Singhal et al., 2019). Remanufacturing costs 40-60% less than creating new products, and it takes as little as 20% of the effort to create a remanufactured product as it does to create a new one (Khor and Hazen, 2017). When it comes to remanufactured products, they are typically 30-40 percent less expensive than new ones (Wang et al., 2020). As a result, because of the effect of perceived value, consumers should see remanufactured products as having a higher value when compared to newly manufactured ones (Karjaluoto et al., 2019). Sustainable supply chains are a priority for businesses, and they're always looking for new methods to advertise their efforts to customers (e.g., Khor and Hazen, 2017). Remanufactured products can save significant amounts of resources, energy, and solid waste if their used components are recovered and remanufactured (Gaur et al., 2015). To put it another way, remanufactured goods can be considered environmentally friendly (Wang et al., 2020). Unless customers are educated about the environmental impact of remanufactured products, they tend to value them less than new products (Gaur et al., 2015). As a result, the perceived value of remanufactured products should be improved by the green value of products (Qu et al., 2018). Remanufactured products have been shown to have a degree of ambiguity when it comes to their quality (Kumar et al., 2017;Singhal et al., 2019). Consistent with prospect theory's foundations, the ambiguity aversion theory suggests that decision makers prefer a known risk to an uncertain risk such as customers deciding whether to buy new or remanufactured products (Abbasi et al., 2022). However, our paper suggests that the perceived risk can be alleviated by imparting objective information about the quality of specific remanufactured products.Customers' understanding of the lower cost of remanufactured products is taken into account when calculating cost knowledge (Singhal et al., 2019).

        <p>Theory of complexity stems from chaos theory, which focuses on nonlinear dynamics and the interactions of a large number of antecedents to produce an outcome (Urry, 2005). According to this theory, a linear analysis of customer behaviour does not offer accurate results because of the complexity and asymmetric associations of factors and behaviour that arise in complex decision-making processes (Farmaki et al., 2022;Kopplin and Rösch, 2021;Olya and Al-ansi, 2018;Woodside, 2014). Instead, multiple-element patterns can accurately drive the complexity characteristics of behaviours (De Canio et al., 2020;Woodside, 2015). Many disciplines, including strategic management (Oyemomi et al., 2019), information systems (Aw, 2020), marketing (Pappas, 2018), and tourism, have embraced complexity theory for its ability to shed light on "black-box" causal configurations (Taheri et al., 2020;Wu et al., 2016).Theory of complexity stems from chaos theory, which focuses on nonlinear dynamics and the interactions of a large number of antecedents to produce an outcome (Urry, 2005).

        <p>After identifying salient factors affecting customers behaviour to purchase remanufactured products, the next step is to develop a theorybased nomological network that can be used to investigate how these factors influence remanufactured behaviour. There may not be a single "best" nomological network due to the "causal asymmetry" in the research question and context, but rather multiple "best" nomological networks may exist (Pappas, 2018). Customers' behaviours to buy remanufactured products based on new production methods may not be explained by a single factor, as the concept of "causal asymmetry" suggests (Taheri et al., 2020). A model that only investigates one antecedent configuration is likely to be insufficient for this study. Because prior studies have shown that customers' individual antecedents of their behaviour when purchasing used products are not always straightforward, complexity theory appears to be an excellent fit for the context in which refurbished products are sold.After identifying salient factors affecting customers behaviour to purchase remanufactured products, the next step is to develop a theorybased nomological network that can be used to investigate how these factors influence remanufactured behaviour.

        <p>According to complexity theory, despite the fact that the aggregate data might show X and Y to be positively related, the same data set can contain a significant number of cases in which X and Y are not or even negatively related in the aggregate (Hsiao et al., 2015). As a result, complexity theory provides a more insightful view of the associations among dependent and independent factors (De Canio et al., 2020), demonstrating that the same outcome can come from multiple possible predictors. These results are due to the fact that the link among the dependent and independent factors is complex, with the potential for various configurations to alter the association (Furnari et al., 2021). So, complexity theory justifies the difference ("as "opposed to symmetry) of links among factors. Because of this, we decided to use complexity theory as a framework for this study.According to complexity theory, despite the fact that the aggregate data might show X and Y to be positively related, the same data set can contain a significant number of cases in which X and Y are not or even negatively related in the aggregate (Hsiao et al., 2015).

        <p>According to complexity theory, even when a set of identical causal factors is used, the results can diverge (Pappas and Glyptou, 2021). Equifinality is a fundamental principle of complexity and configuration theory, which states that more than one possible complex configuration of antecedent conditions can lead to the same outcome (Von Bertalanffy, 1968). An important principle of configuration theory is that a cause that results in an outcome can be different from one which results in its absence or negation (i.e., not being present) (Ragin, 2008). If a factor is present, it may lead to a certain outcome, but if that factor is absent, it may not lead to that outcome being absent (Pappas et al., 2017). A variable can also be insufficient on its own, but it can also be necessary for the same outcome to occur (Woodside, 2017).According to complexity theory, even when a set of identical causal factors is used, the results can diverge (Pappas and Glyptou, 2021).

        <p>Remanufactured product purchases are influenced by a wide range of factors, including ethical, knowledge, and demographic factors (see Fig. 1.). There is a lot of interplay among demographics, ethics, and knowledge when it comes to customers' behaviours to buy remanufactured products. Demographic factors like age, gender, household income, and educational level are shown in arrow A. Deontological variables such as "moral obligation, moral accountability, and moral outrage" can lead to a high level of customer behaviour to purchase (Arrow B1). Customer behaviour to purchase is influenced by a combination of "cost knowledge, green knowledge, and quality knowledge" as shown by arrow C1. Customers' decisions to buy remanufactured products can be affected by the four identified causal recipes, which together form a complex causal configuration (Arrow D2) (Fig. 1).Remanufactured product purchases are influenced by a wide range of factors, including ethical, knowledge, and demographic factors (see Fig. 1.).

        <p>Our theoretical model (Fig. 1) illustrates the four antecedents, intersections of those antecedents, and the outcomes of interest as a result of these asymmetrical links (i.e., remanufactured behaviour). For example, the overlapped areas represent areas where a single factor may co-exist with others. Hypotheses formulated in variance-based methods are commonly employed to identify patterns of variables in a complex system such as remanufactured products, but this technique doesn't allow for a holistic paradigm that can result in multiple solutions. It is possible to specify which variables should be included or excluded from an equation by using configuration theory research methods to formulate propositions as causal recipes (Fiss, 2007).Our theoretical model (Fig. 1) illustrates the four antecedents, intersections of those antecedents, and the outcomes of interest as a result of these asymmetrical links (i.e., remanufactured behaviour).

        <p>Equifinality is the foundational principle of complexity theory, suggest that the desired result can be explained by a variety of different sets of causal conditions working together to produce a sufficient number of possible outcomes. More than one complex configuration or recipe of antecedent conditions can produce the same result (Pappas, 2016). Both high and low conditions of a certain factor may explain high scores of an outcome depending on how they are combined in relation to other factors (i.e., causes). Pappas et al. (2016) argue that deontological, teleological, and product knowledge variables all play a role in the decision-making process of consumers. These variables can interact in a variety of ways, and because consumers' perceptions vary, they may weigh different combinations of factors before making a purchase. The impact of Deontological and teleological variables on consumer purchasing behaviour is further mediated by attitudes (Agag and Colmekcioglu, 2020). No single combination of deontological, teleological, and product knowledge variables can explain purchase behaviour, but various combinations of these factors are likely to occur.Equifinality is the foundational principle of complexity theory, suggest that the desired result can be explained by a variety of different sets of causal conditions working together to produce a sufficient number of possible outcomes.

        <p>In this study, deontological variables (moral obligation, moral accountability, and moral outrage), teleological (perceived risk and perceived benefits), and knowledge variables (cost knowledge, green knowledge, and quality knowledge) are significant causal recipes that can combine in various configurations in order to understand customers behaviour towards remanufactured products. Salam et al. (2022) revealed that customers intentions to purchase sustainable products is influenced by moral obligation, moral accountability, and moral outrage. Apart from product knowledge, Wang and Hazen (2016) indicated that cost knowledge, green knowledge, and quality knowledge are also the key determinants of customers remanufactured behaviour.In this study, deontological variables (moral obligation, moral accountability, and moral outrage), teleological (perceived risk and perceived benefits), and knowledge variables (cost knowledge, green knowledge, and quality knowledge) are significant causal recipes that can combine in various configurations in order to understand customers behaviour towards remanufactured products.

        <p>Therefore, the following proposition can be derived from a combination of demographic, deontological, teleological, and knowledge variables:Therefore, the following proposition can be derived from a combination of demographic, deontological, teleological, and knowledge variables:</p>

        <p>Complexity theory also relies on the principle of causal asymmetry (Fiss, 2007). Cause and effect relationships are not supported by the principle of causal asymmetry, which rules out single cause and linear (symmetrical) relationships (Pappas et al., 2016). Complex causality and non-linear (asymmetrical) relations mean that the same causal variable may have various ("possibly even contrasting") impacts on the outcome of interest depending how they combine with other causal variables. For instance, there aren't polar opposite configurations that result in positive and negative outcomes (Taheri et al., 2020). According to the theory of complexity, causal variables interact to create patterns or collective properties (Urry, 2005). As a result, the occurrence and nature of an outcome are typically influenced by a number of causal variables whose patterning can be traced back to multiple causes. The patterns of causal variables can be viewed conceptually as sets of configurations with a common thread. These single causes are therefore unlikely to be sufficient to produce a result, such as remanufactured behaviour, as a result (Fiss, 2007). The recipe, which is to say, the causes of remanufactured behaviour, is more important. This assumption is supported by previous examination that takes a contingency perspective and shows that remanufactured behaviour is influenced by the interaction of various variables, with single variable reinforcing or weakening the effects of others Singhal et al., 2019). Customers' reactions to remanufactured products have been mixed, so it's possible to achieve high behaviour to purchase remanufactured products that appear to be deontological or teleological depending on how they combine with other knowledge and demographics variables. Deontological, teleological, and knowledge factors may all be present in alternative remanufactured behaviour configurations. Following this, we propose the following:Complexity theory also relies on the principle of causal asymmetry (Fiss, 2007).

Perceived benefits were measured using three items from Dodds et al. (1991) (e.g., "Buying remanufactured products can lower purchase cost compared to buying new products"). Cost knowledge was measured using three items from Wang and Hazen (2016) (e.g., "Compared to new products, the cost to produce remanufacture products is much less, and the price is low"). Green knowledge was measured using three items from Wang and Hazen (2016) (e.g., "Compared to new products, remanufactured products can save the energy and the materials, which significantly reduces negative influences on the environment"). Quality knowledge was measured using three items from Wang and Hazen (2016) (e.g., "The quality and performance of remanufactured products can be the same as or even better than the new products and have the same after-sale services"). The questionnaire was first translated into Arabic, and then the Arabic questions were retranslated into English by linguists from the UK. This was followed by consulting with certified translators to fill in any gaps in the back-translated questionnaire. Furthermore, a pilot test using 50 consumers was conducted. Their feedback has been taken into consideration to refine the questionnaire.</p>
        <p>Preventative and post-detection procedures were used in this research to lessen the common method variance (CMV) problem. We used anonymous survey participants and randomly ordered measurement items, as well as hiding the construct labels to minimise participants' anxiety about participating in this research (Podsakoff et al., 2003). To ensure that all of the observed constructs in the model have the same difference, the common latent factor (CLF) method (Eichhorn, 2014) was utilised. With all latent constructs and their corresponding indicators included, the CLF was added to the measurement model With the CLF and without it, standardised regression weights were found to be similar (variances were less than 0.2) in both models (Gaskin, 2017). With CLF and without CLF, the model fit indices were also comparable ("model with CLF: χ2 /df = 1.780; model without CLF: χ2 /df = 1.932"). This is consistent with the results of the two models. Thus, there is no evidence of a major CMV problem in the data.Preventative and post-detection procedures were used in this research to lessen the common method variance (CMV) problem.

        <p>In order to explain how demographics variables, deontological, teleological, and products knowledge variables work together to produce high remanufactured behaviour, fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis was utilised. FsQCA is a useful tool for our research because it allows us to examine the modelling of asymmetrical links among constructs. Firs, 
            <rs type="software">fsQCA</rs> focuses on "the middle ground" among quantitative and qualitative approaches (Ragin, 2009). As a result, case studies with a small number of participants can be evaluated using standard statistical analyses. Regression methods are that it can only uncover two-or three-way interactions effects, while cluster analysis only uncovers homogeneous patterns with no control over the outcomes (Fainshmidt et al., 2020). Cases are viewed as combinations of theoretically relevant attributes in fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, which explores the subset relations to gain insight into the links among these attributes and interest outcome (Ragin, 2009). Multi-way interactions and the systemic combination of constructs may necessitate the use of 
            <rs type="software">fsQCA</rs> (Ferrigno et al., 2021).
        </p>
        <p>Calibrating the 
            <rs type="software">fsQCA</rs> model, which is a crucial part of the process, involves converting the empirical data into measures of set membership using theoretical or substantive knowledge that is separate from the empirical data. Interval scale values are converted to fuzzy-set membership scores according to three anchors: "full membership, full nonmembership, and the crossover point" (Rai et al., 2006). Calibration of fuzzy-set memberships follows Ragin's (2009) work. We base our thresholds for each calibration on industry common standards, extant theory, or substantive knowledge. To convert the measurements into set memberships, we employed the 
            <rs type="software">fsQCA</rs> software's direct calibration method (e.g., Pappas et al., 2016). Likert scale items have a built-in membership score, but only to a certain extent. Because the study variables were assessed utilising a 5-point Likert scale, we used 5 as the "fully-in-the-set cut-off point", 3 as the "crossover point", and 1 as the "fully-not-in-the-set point". For solutions, a frequency of one and a consistency cut-off of 0.75% met the recommended minimum threshold of 0.75 (Ragin, 2009). This procedure identifies any connections among a set of possibly causal and the desired outcome. In a fuzzy-set truth table analysis, one or more combinations of characteristics associated with an outcome can be generated. After the calibration is finished, the 
            <rs type="software">fsQCA</rs> algorithm is used to generate a 2 k -row truth table , where k is the number of outcome drivers, and each row demonstrates a unique permutation of the predictors. Frequency and consistency should be used to refine the truth table (Ragin, 2008). The frequency measures how many times each possible combination has been observed. Consistency can be described as "the degree to which cases correspond to the set-theoretic relationships expressed in a solution" (Fiss, 2011, p.402). To ensure sufficient data for evaluating subset relationships, a threshold for the frequency of occurrences is chosen. A cut-off point of one is reasonable for small and medium-sized samples, but a higher cut-off point is warranted for large-scale samples (e.g., 150 or more cases) (Ragin, 2008). The recommended minimum frequency of observations is set at three, while the lowest acceptable consistency for observations is set at N &gt; 0.85. (Ragin, 2009). In the following section, we present the findings.

        <p>Table 2 shows that all study variables had composite reliability (CR) and average variance extracted (AVE) values greater than 0.7 and 0.5 thresholds, confirming the convergent validity of all study variables (Hair et al., 2017). To verify discriminant validity, "the heterotrait-monotrait" (HTMT) ratio of correlations criterion was applied (Henseler et al., 2015). Results indicated that the discriminant validity of HTMT was supported, as all HTMT values were less than 0.85 threshold. Moreover, the values of AVEs were compared to the relevant squared among-variable correlations. Table 3 shows that the values of AVEs were greater than the relevant squared among-construct correlations. Thus, these results support the study's discriminant validity.Table 2 shows that all study variables had composite reliability (CR) and average variance extracted (AVE) values greater than 0.7 and 0.5 thresholds, confirming the convergent validity of all study variables (Hair et al., 2017).

        <p>Table 4 demonstrates the findings of FsQCA for achieving high level of remanufactured purchase behaviour (RFB). The "black circles" (•) is used to demonstrate a condition presence, while the absence of a condition can be demonstrated by the "crossed-out circles" (⊗) (Beynon et al., 2016). There are large circles for the core elements of a configuration, and smaller circles for the periphery elements. Blank spaces show a do not care situation where the causative condition can be present or missing. Each causal recipes and the overall solution have set theoretic consistency values that are all greater than the cut-off value (N = 0.75). An approximate subset link is assessed by consistency, while the empirical relevance of an approximate subset link is assessed by coverage (Dul, 2016). It is akin to the R-square value stated in correlational approaches to show the extent to which high purchasing behaviours are defined depending on the collection of configurations (Oyemomi et al., 2019). The overall solution coverage is 0.89, which indicates that the six solutions cover a significant amount of the outcome.Table 4 demonstrates the findings of FsQCA for achieving high level of remanufactured purchase behaviour (RFB).

        <p>We tested for predictive validity to explore how well the proposed model can predict the dependent factor (i.e., consumers' behaviour to purchase remanufactured products) in additional samples (Oyemomi et al., 2019). Predictive validity is significant because merely having a good model fit does not guarantee that the model can accurately predict the outcomes of a given experiment. To accomplish this, we divided our sample into subsample and a control sample. Complex antecedents' condition is consistent predictors of greater purchase behaviour using the subsample (see Table 7). Testing model 1 predictions yielded results that show high consistency (0.887) and high coverage (0.649). For all models, predictive tests proposed that the highly consistent models for the subsample have great predictive abilities for the holdout sample and vice versa.We tested for predictive validity to explore how well the proposed model can predict the dependent factor (i.e., consumers' behaviour to purchase remanufactured products) in additional samples (Oyemomi et al., 2019).

        <p>The findings of our research indicated that most of the identified solutions can attain a high level of purchase behaviour when they have a high level of moral obligation and moral accountability combined with perceived risk and cost knowledge.

        <p>This study is consistent with other studies indicating the importance of a low-price marketing strategy in the remanufacturing industry in order to attract potential buyers (Salam et al., 2022). Remanufactured products' perceived quality has a significant impact on customer purchase behaviour, possibly due to quality and reliability concerns regarding remanufactured products, as noted in the literature (Wang and Hazen, 2016).

        <p>First, this paper addresses a critical question that has been posed by Salam et al. (2022): how do teleological and deontological variables work together to improve consumer sustainable behaviour? Using structural equation modelling and regression analysis to go beyond traditional interpretations, previous studies have focused on how teleological, deontological, and product knowledge components interact (e. g., Salam et al., 2022;Wang and Hazen, 2016). Much of the literature on remanufactured goods suggests that the high rate of remanufactured product purchase is due to a combination of teleological, deontological, and product knowledge factors. However, the findings of this study using fsQCA show that teleological beliefs, deontological values, and product expertise all interact to shape consumers' decisions to buy refurbished goods. Second, since Vicente-Molina et al. (2013) revealed that sustainable behaviour is influenced by cost knowledge and green knowledge, there has been a major debate in the marketing and consumer behaviour field about the value of product knowledge for sustainable behaviour (Sönnichsen and Clement, 2020). According to Maniatis (2016), sustainable behaviour may be the result of specific combinations of input components such as green knowledge, cost and quality knowledge. Our study clarified this debate by offering further evidence shows that customer remanufactured behaviour can be enhanced with the interaction between cost knowledge, green knowledge, and quality knowledge.First, this paper addresses a critical question that has been posed by Salam et al.

        <p>Customers' opinions of refurbished goods may be shaped by how well they know the product's history (Wang and Hazen, 2016). In the case of laptop computers, for instance, Jiménez-Parra et al. ( 2014) discovered that consumers are more likely to purchase a remanufactured product based on their awareness of the product's similarity to new products and the price. It is still unclear how information about various forms of refurbished goods affects consumers' final decisions. In this study, we investigate the influence of various types of product knowledge on customers' purchasing decisions for remanufactured products using an integrated research model grounded in complexity theory.Customers' opinions of refurbished goods may be shaped by how well they know the product's history (Wang and Hazen, 2016).

This research advanced our comprehending of the 'black box' among teleological, deontological, product knowledge and remanufactured behaviour by examining the complex causality between deontological variables (moral obligation, moral accountability, moral outage), complementary teleological variables (perceived risk, perceived benefits) and product knowledge. The analysis not only demonstrate the synergy effect of these three configurations in attaching enhanced remanufactured behaviours, but also indicate that deontological variables cannot attain this alone.From a practical point of view, our study provides retailers with meaningful practical implications that aid them to understand consumers behaviours to purchase refurbished products.

This will result in invoking the sense of duty towards oneself, others and the environment, causing a surge of remanufactured products adoption. Merely marketing remanufactured products as a lifestyle has not done much to promote it. Remanufactured products are credence goods, and customers lack information about the processes and costs associated at various stages of their production. Thus, they look for authentic certification and formal and informal communication to reduce the purchase risk. This study demonstrated that consumers lack cost, green, quality knowledge in remanufactured products, implying that remanufactured producers and marketers might increase consumers awareness and knowledge about the production process to bolster consumption behaviours. Thus, it is important that the retailers produce relevant and easily understandable information for the potential consumers to convert them into adopters of remanufactured products.It guides the marketers and retailers to appeal to the ethical values of consumers to promote the uptake of remanufactured products.

        <p>It is important for the government and retailers to work together to promote remanufactured products as being effectively "as good as new" due to the fact that quality and price were found to be the most important factors and customers cannot verify quality before using the product. During this examination, it was found that only a few customers demonstrated a thorough understanding of remanufactured products, and many remained skeptical about them. In order to establish trust between retailers, their products, and customers, it is critical for those in the remanufacturing industry to set high quality standards for remanufactured goods and to offer certification of these standards to customers (Wang and Hazen, 2016). It is suggested that government and retailers should work together to establish technical standards and evaluation systems for remanufacturing.It is important for the government and retailers to work together to promote remanufactured products as being effectively "as good as new" due to the fact that quality and price were found to be the most important factors and customers cannot verify quality before using the product.

        <p>Our research is not without limitations. First, this investigation focuses on collecting data from consumers in Saudi Arabia. While prior studies revealed that customers vary in their perceptions and attitudes towards sustainable consumption, future study can test our proposed model in different cultural context for the purpose of generalisability. Second, our study focuses on consumers perceptions about remanufactured products without considering of the type of remanufactured product. Future studies can apply our model on specific type of product such as Smartphones or Ipod. Third, our study utilised survey to collect the required data. Therefore, future studies can use a mixed-method approach, such as a qualitative Delphi method, and perform a content analysis to offer a solid basis for the identified configurations. Fourth, previous studies revealed that demographic variables and personality traits influence on consumers sustainable behaviour. Therefore, future studies can explore the moderating role of demographic variables and personality traits on consumers behaviour to purchase remanufactured products. Fifth, external variables (i.e., economic differences, market differences) in industry of remanufacturing, should be included in our proposed model to better understand consumers behaviours to purchase remanufactured products. Finally, our study identified four configurations that can lead to high level of remanufactured behaviour. Future studies can consider other behaviours and attitudes variables that can result in high level of remanufactured behaviour.Our research is not without limitations.
