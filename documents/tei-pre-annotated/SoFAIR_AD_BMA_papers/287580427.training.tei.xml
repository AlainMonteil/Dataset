        <p>This paper meta-analytically investigates a theoretical framework of emotional labour and its antecedents and outcomes in the hospitality and tourism literature with 57 correlation matrices from published journal papers. Adopting the psychometric meta-analytical methods and meta-structural equation modelling (meta-SEM) methods, the study finds that emotional labour is related to antecedents including personality, emotional intelligence, customer orientation, social support and display rules, as well as related to attitudinal, behavioural, and customer-related outcomes. In addition, strain mediates the relations between emotional labour and its outcomes. This paper is the first meta-analysis on the relations between emotional labour and the antecedents and outcomes in hospitality and tourism management.This paper meta-analytically investigates a theoretical framework of emotional labour and its antecedents and outcomes in the hospitality and tourism literature with 57 correlation matrices from published journal papers.

        <p>The hospitality and tourism industry is characterised as being labour-intensive and it involves unusual working hours and high workload (Tsaur &amp; Tang, 2012). As part of their daily work, hospitality employees need to interact with others, essentially the customers.The hospitality and tourism industry is characterised as being labour-intensive and it involves unusual working hours and high workload (Tsaur &amp; Tang, 2012).

        <p>During these interactions, the employees have to perform emotional labour, which is referred to "the management of feeling to create a publicly observable facial and bodily display" (Hochschild, 1983, p. 7). Managing emotions is part of organisational rules because organisational decision makers and employees believe that expressing and suppressing certain emotions help facilitate greater performance. Healthy interactions between employees and customers are a core aspect of organisational psychology and marketing literature (Payne &amp; Frow, 2005). Subsequently, this line of research has increased initiatives from employers and policy makers aiming at managing employee emotions and enhancing their well-being (Grandey &amp; Melloy, 2017). A better and more integrated understanding of emotional labour is useful to identify additional approaches to managing employee emotions. Correspondingly, it is vital to have a comprehensive picture of the factors that cause and result from emotional labour and provide directions for future research and applications in managing employee emotions.During these interactions, the employees have to perform emotional labour, which is referred to "the management of feeling to create a publicly observable facial and bodily display" (Hochschild, 1983, p. 7).

        <p>For researchers to build an extensive framework of emotional labour and develop a cohesive body of research, conceptually elaborating and empirically examining the existing literature is imperative (Humphrey, Ashforth, &amp; Diefendorff, 2015). Given the accumulation of this line of research, the purpose of the current paper is to investigate the antecedents and outcomes of emotional labour in the hospitality and tourism industry through statistically integrating the previous findings by using a comprehensive, theory-driven meta-analysis. Specifically, this paper (a) presents a theoretically sound framework of the antecedents and outcomes of emotional labour; (b) examines the hypotheses proposed in the framework with an accretion of emotional labour studies in hospitality and tourism, (c) examines the psychological mechanisms linking emotional labour and its outcomes, with strain as a mediator.For researchers to build an extensive framework of emotional labour and develop a cohesive body of research, conceptually elaborating and empirically examining the existing literature is imperative (Humphrey, Ashforth, &amp; Diefendorff, 2015).

        <p>We identify important theories used to define emotional labour and explain the relations between emotional labour and related constructs. The core set of theories provides guidance for research in this area and fosters accumulation and advancement of research in the study of employee emotional labour (Grandey &amp; Melloy, 2017). Based on the relevant theories and the 57 correlation matrices in published papers, our conceptual framework and empirical metaanalysis build clarity around the construct of emotional labour as a foundation for researchers to develop more solid and innovative studies on this burgeoning topic in the future.We identify important theories used to define emotional labour and explain the relations between emotional labour and related constructs.

        <p>In the past few decades, increasing research attentions have been paid on how service providers display emotions to customers during the service interactions, and how organisations seek to monitor those emotional displays (e.g., Grandey &amp; Melloy, 2017;Hülsheger &amp; Schewe, 2011). Displaying organisationally expected emotions to the customers involves a pattern of labour, which requires service providers to expend their effort to do the job (Hochschild, 1983).In the past few decades, increasing research attentions have been paid on how service providers display emotions to customers during the service interactions, and how organisations seek to monitor those emotional displays (e.g., Grandey &amp; Melloy, 2017;Hülsheger &amp; Schewe, 2011).

        <p>Triggered by the development in research activity on this topic, the definitions of emotional labour and corresponding inventories have become further differentiated with regards to different acting strategies (Grandey, 2000). The existing literature has identified two forms of emotional labour strategies, including surface acting and deep acting. While surface acting is about faking the expected emotions, deep acting involves actually feeling and experiencing the expected emotions (Grandey, 2000). These two distinct dimensions require distinct resources, because surface acting implicates "going through the motions," while deep acting involves "putting oneself in other's shoes" and entails attempts to actually experience the desired emotion (Lam &amp; Chen, 2012). Generally, service providers have to display organisationallyexpected emotions in the service transactions, disregarding whether they engage in surface acting or deep acting.Triggered by the development in research activity on this topic, the definitions of emotional labour and corresponding inventories have become further differentiated with regards to different acting strategies (Grandey, 2000).

        <p>When employees put on a happy but disingenuous face, they experience tension when they realise they should display emotions different from their authentic emotions (Xu, Martinez, &amp; Lv, 2017a). This experience could be particularly draining and uncomfortable for employees, and organisations also begin to experience problems such as employee burnout and turnover, due to the physiological and psychological demands of emotion regulation and the associated emotional dissonance (e.g., Jung &amp; Yoon, 2014;Krannitz, Grandey, Liu, &amp; Almeida, 2015). This supports conservation of resources (COR, Hobfoll, 1989) model, which posits that individuals strive to gain, protect, and preserve resources as much as they can. Resource depletion due to surface acting could result in negative outcomes (Krannitz et al., 2015).When employees put on a happy but disingenuous face, they experience tension when they realise they should display emotions different from their authentic emotions (Xu, Martinez, &amp; Lv, 2017a).

        <p>Nevertheless, deep acting involves attempting to change internal emotions to match the requirements of the situation (e.g., a depressed front desk employee tries to cheer him/herself up before starting the shift). Although deep acting requires cognitive effort, it restores resources by reducing the discrepancy between internal feelings and external expressions and developing the likelihood of a positive interaction (Xu et al., 2017a). Therefore, when employees perform deep acting, it buffers them from negative mood and results in more positive emotional experience (Grandey, 2003). Deep acting develops positive resources for employees overtime, because the outcomes of deep acting involve restoration of positive emotions and enhanced satisfaction.Nevertheless, deep acting involves attempting to change internal emotions to match the requirements of the situation (e.g., a depressed front desk employee tries to cheer him/herself up before starting the shift).

        <p>This paper links two emotional labour strategies (i.e., surface acting and deep acting) to their respective antecedents and outcomes through various theories. This paper disentangles antecedent constructs into categories of individual or dispositional factors (including personality, emotional intelligence and customer orientation) and organisational or contextual factors (including social support and display rules). Outcome variables include employee attitudinal outcomes (job satisfaction, organisational commitment and turnover intentions), employee behavioural outcomes (service performance, organisational citizenship behaviour, counterproductive workplace behaviour, creativity, and customer-oriented behaviour), and customer-related outcomes (tips received and customer satisfaction). In addition, strain is investigated as a mediator between emotional labour and outcomes. This paper provides a finegrained examination of these factors.This paper links two emotional labour strategies (i.e., surface acting and deep acting) to their respective antecedents and outcomes through various theories.

        <p>Personality is defined as the organisation of mental structures and coordination of mental processes that could determine ones' perceptual and behavioural responses to the surrounding environment (Michel et al., 2011). Within the emotional labour literature in hospitality and tourism, extraversion and neuroticism have received adequate empirical attention in the literature to allow for examination in meta-analysis and those two personality traits have shown to be related to employee emotions (Bono &amp; Vey, 2007;Rusting &amp; Larsen, 1997). Extraversion is associated with traits such as being sociable, talkative and active, while neuroticism is associated with characteristics such as worry, nervousness and tendency to experience distress (Barrick &amp; Mount, 1991;Erdheim et al., 2006). Extraversion and neuroticism are proposed as the antecedents of emotional labour because those two constructs tend to have a strong influence on how employees manage emotions at workplace (Kim, 2008).Personality is defined as the organisation of mental structures and coordination of mental processes that could determine ones' perceptual and behavioural responses to the surrounding environment (Michel et al., 2011).

        <p>Broaden-and-build theory (Fredrickson, 2001) can explain the relation between personality and emotional labour strategies. Based on this theory, when one is high on dispositional positive affectivity, his/her momentary thought-action repertoire can be broadened. Through this process, positive emotions can build up one's personal resources in work situations. Thus, those higher in positive affectivity tend to use their personal resources to improve the functioning; they are more likely to search for solutions and resources to reduce stress and apply the resources to facilitate functioning in their performance. Thus, individuals higher in positive affectivity could experience higher control of the surrounding situations and engage more in deep acting (Grandey, 2000). On the contrary, based on broaden-and-build theory, when an individual is constantly experiencing negative emotions, it narrows his/her thought-action repertoires. Thus, they may seek fewer solutions to help manage demands and expectations from their organisations, which makes them engage more in surface acting (Totterdell &amp; Holman, 2003).Broaden-and-build theory (Fredrickson, 2001) can explain the relation between personality and emotional labour strategies.

        <p>We use high extraversion as a proxy for positive affectivity and high neuroticism as a proxy for negative affectivity, given the well-replicated relation between extraversion and positive affectivity, and neuroticism and negative affectivity (e.g., Costa &amp; McCrae, 1980;Scollon &amp; Diener, 2006). The relationship between extraversion/neuroticism and emotional labour has been demonstrated in several hospitality studies. In an investigation of hospitality and tourism employees in Turkey, Gursoy, Boylu and Avci (2011) demonstrated that neuroticism is positively related to surface acting. Hameed (2016) found that extraversion is positively associated with deep acting while neuroticism is positively associated with surface acting with a sample of hotel employees in Pakistan. Kim (2008) also uncovered the same relations in a sample of frontline employees from the lodging industry in the US. Accordingly, we hypothesise that: Hypothesis 1a: Neuroticism is positively related to surface acting. Hypothesis 1b: Extraversion is positively related to deep acting.We use high extraversion as a proxy for positive affectivity and high neuroticism as a proxy for negative affectivity, given the well-replicated relation between extraversion and positive affectivity, and neuroticism and negative affectivity (e.g., Costa &amp; McCrae, 1980;Scollon &amp; Diener, 2006).

        <p>Emotional intelligence refers to one's ability to observe, comprehend, and manage his/her own emotions as well as those of others (Wong &amp; Law, 2002). Service providers with higher emotional intelligence are more capable to modify feelings to the environment and regulate their emotions appropriately. That is, individuals with higher emotional intelligence can respond sensitively to and accommodate their own and others' emotions (Lee &amp; Ok, 2012).Emotional intelligence refers to one's ability to observe, comprehend, and manage his/her own emotions as well as those of others (Wong &amp; Law, 2002).

        <p>According to Carmeli (2003), emotionally intelligent individuals are adaptive and flexible in regulating their emotions to be consistent with situational demands. They can handle their negative emotions and focus on their positive emotions. Sony and Mekoth (2016) argued that employees with high emotional intelligence are aware of what emotions are (un)expected or (un)acceptable in the interpersonal interactions. Grandey and Melloy (2017) suggested that individuals with high emotional intelligence normally perform deep acting, and they tend to engage in more positive social interactions with customers, such as showing concern, voluntarily helping customers, and they are perceived as good peers since they can comprehend social cues (e.g., emotional expression and behaviour) in communications.According to Carmeli (2003), emotionally intelligent individuals are adaptive and flexible in regulating their emotions to be consistent with situational demands.

        <p>The COR theory (Hobfoll, 1989) suggests that individuals endeavour to keep and manage their personal resources. According to the theory, the amount of employees' resources could impact their choice of emotional labour strategy (Kim, Yoo, Lee, &amp; Kim, 2012). Based on the availability of their personal resources, employees engage either in surface acting or deep acting to maintain their resources. Employees with rich resources tend to engage in deep acting, while those who lack resources would surface act to minimise resource loss and conserve energy (Liu, Prati, Perrewe, &amp; Ferris, 2008). Those high in emotional intelligence can perceive others' emotions and turn the emotional resources into needed emotions based on the situations. Therefore, they tend to engage in deep acting in performing their jobs (Gabriel, Cheshin, Moran, &amp; van Kleef, 2016). They can perform emotional labour using emotional intelligence as fundamental resources. They are capable of noticing the positive aspects of expected emotions at work and better controlling their own emotions.The COR theory (Hobfoll, 1989) suggests that individuals endeavour to keep and manage their personal resources.

        <p>In the hospitality and tourism literature, Kim et al. (2012) demonstrated that emotional intelligence was positively associated with employees' deep acting and negatively related to surface acting strategy in a sample of five-star hotel employees in Korea. Utilising data collected from hotel employees in South China, Wen, Huang and Hou (2019) demonstrated the same results. In addition, in a sample of customer service employees working in fine-dining restaurants in Florida, Kim, Han and Kang (2019) also found that emotional intelligence negatively predicted surface acting and positively predicted deep acting. Thus, we hypothesise the following: Hypothesis 2a: Emotional intelligence is negatively related to surface acting. Hypothesis 2b: Emotional intelligence is positively related to deep acting.In the hospitality and tourism literature, Kim et al.

        <p>The pursuit of the "customer is always right" and "customer is God" philosophy is always the priority in the hospitality and tourism industry. This is called customer orientation, which is defined as the service employees' awareness and willingness to satisfy customers' needs, wants and demands via high quality service (Lee, Ok, &amp; Hwang, 2016). It represents one's pre-disposition to provide courteous and ardent service in service transactions geared towards continuously enhancing service performance (Lee, Ok, Lee, &amp; Lee, 2018). It is a critical trait that enables employees to carry out jobs and gain access to important information on customer needs. Customer-oriented employees enthusiastically strive to exceed customers' expectations, deal with customers' requests promptly and treat customers politely (e.g., Babakus, Yavas, &amp; Karatepe, 2017). There is a natural fit between employees who are high in customer orientation and the expectations of the service jobs (Lee et al., 2016).The pursuit of the "customer is always right" and "customer is God" philosophy is always the priority in the hospitality and tourism industry.

        <p>In line with the COR theory (Hobfoll, 1989), employees are striving to preserve resources to cope with stress. Customer orientation is the available energetic resource; employees high in customer orientation are committed to customer service to foster meaningful interactions with customers by showing warmth, empathy and consideration (e.g., Smith et al., 2012). Therefore, they tend to regulate their internal feelings and display the required emotions, and are less likely to act superficially in service transactions (Wu &amp; Shie, 2017). In the hospitality and tourism context, for example, Smith et al. (2012) found that restaurant employees with higher levels of customer orientation are more likely to adopt deep acting. Lee et al. (2016) demonstrated that customer orientation is positively associated with deep acting and negatively associated with surface acting with a sample of US hotel employees. Wu and Shie (2017) also confirmed the same direction of relationship using hotel employees in China.In line with the COR theory (Hobfoll, 1989), employees are striving to preserve resources to cope with stress.

        <p>Social support refers to the instrumental aid, emotional concern, or informational inputs from the others that can strengthen one's feelings of self-importance and help improve the quality of relationships (Carlson &amp; Perrewe, 1999). Social support could include various sources including coworkers, the direct supervisor, and the organisation. The relationship between social support and emotional labour can be illustrated by affective event theory (AET, Weiss &amp; Cropanzano, 1996). AET and supporting empirical evidence suggest that emotions are a dynamic function of a relevant event or experience (Griffin &amp; Clarke, 2011;Weiss &amp; Cropanzano, 1996). Specifically, AET suggests that emotional and behavioural outcomes are responses to workplace events. An initial evaluation of workplace event shapes one's emotional reaction, which in turn shapes affective states and behaviours. Therefore, perceived social support can be a strong predictor of using different emotional labour strategies, which functions as a proximal source of affective reactions, perceptions, and behaviours (Weiss &amp; Cropanzano, 1996). Service employees' affective experiences about the extent to which their organisations, supervisors, and coworkers care for them have been the key factor in impacting the choice of different emotional labour strategies (e.g., Hur, Moon, &amp; Jun, 2013).Social support refers to the instrumental aid, emotional concern, or informational inputs from the others that can strengthen one's feelings of self-importance and help improve the quality of relationships (Carlson &amp; Perrewe, 1999).

        <p>Social support can deliver advice, comfort, and concern to buffer employees against stressful events (Lam &amp; Chen, 2012). Support could include communicating constructive feedback and providing assistance to enable employees to complete the job, at the same time expressing empathy and caring about the needs of employees. If social support is high, service providers would perceive being treated fairly and respectfully, thus they are more able to handle the challenges or stress in the workplace. Hospitality research has suggested that social support prompts service providers to engage in less surface acting and more deep acting during service interactions (e.g., Lam &amp; Chen, 2012). Social support can trigger corresponding positive affective reactions (Reeck, Ames, &amp; Ochsner, 2016). If employees' emotion is well attuned to the display rules, they will be inspired to experience the expected emotions, which, in essence, is deep acting (Grandey, 2000). Therefore, we hypothesise that higher levels of social support lead employees to perform deep acting, while lower levels of social support lead them to fake their emotions through surface acting.Social support can deliver advice, comfort, and concern to buffer employees against stressful events (Lam &amp; Chen, 2012).

If employees' emotion is well attuned to the display rules, they will be inspired to experience the expected emotions, which, in essence, is deep acting (Grandey, 2000). Therefore, we hypothesise that higher levels of social support lead employees to perform deep acting, while lower levels of social support lead them to fake their emotions through surface acting.</p>
        <p>Hypothesis 4a: Social support is negatively related to surface acting. Hypothesis 4b: Social support is positively related to deep acting.Hypothesis 4a: Social support is negatively related to surface acting. Hypothesis 4b: Social support is positively related to deep acting.</p>
        <p>Organisational display rules can highly regulate expected employee expression and influence emotional labour. Service occupations have strong norms and expectations on emotional displays (Hochschild, 1983). The literature has claimed that display rules is related to emotional acting (Grandey &amp; Melloy, 2017). Studies have distinguished display rules to positive and negative ones: positive display rules refer to employees' "perceptions of expressing positive emotions" while negative display rules refer to "the perceptions of suppressing negative emotions" in the workplace (Kim, 2008, p. 153). Diefendorff, Croyle, and Gosserand's (2005) results showed that higher positive display rules are related to higher deep acting, and higher negative display rules are related to higher surface acting. They interpreted that positive rules ("what to express") define expectations better and contribute to "acting in good faith" (i.e., deep acting), while negative rules ("what not to express") make service providers just go through the motions and "act in bad faith" (i.e., surface acting).Organisational display rules can highly regulate expected employee expression and influence emotional labour.

        <p>In hospitality and tourism organisations, clear norms (e.g., showing friendly smiles and upbeat energy) are normally in the job description and service providers are trained accordingly (Kim, 2008). Theoretically, it is logical that different display rules increase the probability of employees' different emotional regulation strategies, resulting in either surface acting or deep acting. Thus, in line with Diefendorff et al. (2005), it is predicted that positive display rules lead to deep acting, and negative display rules lead to surface acting. That is, when organisations ask employees to display positive emotions (e.g., cheerful greetings), they proactively try to experience the positive emotions. In contrast, when employees are required to hide negative feelings (e.g., suppressing distress or anger), they might just pretend not to display those emotions. Therefore, we hypothesise that: Hypothesis 5a: Positive display rules are positively related to deep acting. Hypothesis 5b: Negative display rules are positively related to surface acting.In hospitality and tourism organisations, clear norms (e.g., showing friendly smiles and upbeat energy) are normally in the job description and service providers are trained accordingly (Kim, 2008).

        <p>Employee attitudinal outcomes are the consequences of emotional labour that are related to how employees feel toward their organisation, which include job satisfaction, turnover intentions, and organisational commitment. Job satisfaction is the most frequently investigated employee attitudinal outcome of emotional labour (Gursoy et al., 2011;Lee &amp; Ok, 2012;Lee et al., 2016) and the COR theory (Hobfoll, 1989) is the most pervasively used theory to explain the link between emotional labour and job satisfaction. Based upon the COR theory, engaging in surface acting necessitates the expenditure of resources given that it involves the suppression of emotions (Brotheridge &amp; Lee, 2002). Distress could occur when employees lose resources, which impacts their attitudes toward the job (Grandey, 2000). Employees might think about leaving their current company to preserve their limited resources, if they believe that they cannot deal with the challenges arising from surface acting. Due to drained resource, surface acting could create a desire to escape and even quit the job (Xu et al., 2017a). In contrast, deep acting entails trying to feel positive internally, yielding authentic and positive emotional displays. According to COR theory, hospitality and tourism researchers have found that surface acting is negatively related to attitudinal outcomes including job satisfaction, organisational commitment and intent to remain, and deep acting is positively related to those outcomes (e.g., Kim &amp; Back, 2012;Wu, Shie, &amp; Gordon, 2017). Lee and Ok (2012) used facial feedback hypothesis (Adelmann &amp; Zajonc, 1989) to analyse the effect of emotional labour strategies on job satisfaction. The hypothesis suggests that positive emotions displayed by a service provider would make customers experience positive emotions, which in turn generate positive reactions and the subsequent job satisfaction of the service provider. When an employee engages in deep acting, the customer can detect the positive and sincere emotions of the employee. The customer can then give the employee positive response accordingly, which makes the employee frequently experience good moods in the workplace.Employee attitudinal outcomes are the consequences of emotional labour that are related to how employees feel toward their organisation, which include job satisfaction, turnover intentions, and organisational commitment.

        <p>Other scholars used the AET framework (Weiss &amp; Cropanzano, 1996) to explain the link between emotional labour and employee attitudinal outcomes (e.g., Lam &amp; Chen, 2012).Other scholars used the AET framework (Weiss &amp; Cropanzano, 1996) to explain the link between emotional labour and employee attitudinal outcomes (e.g., Lam &amp; Chen, 2012).</p>
        <p>AET argues that affective experiences have effects on individuals' evaluative judgments about their jobs and work environments (positive and negative emotions). Employees will then perform surface acting or deep acting, which are affect-driven behaviours, during service interactions. These affect-driven behaviours, in turn, can contribute to their levels of attitudes toward the job (Lam &amp; Chen, 2012). Therefore, the following hypotheses were proposed:AET argues that affective experiences have effects on individuals' evaluative judgments about their jobs and work environments (positive and negative emotions).

        <p>Surface acting normally leads to negative behavioural outcomes. Surface acting depletes one's mental resources, which may impair employees' task performance. In contrast, deep acting yields authentic emotional displays that would benefit employees' behavioural outcomes. Bakker and Demerouti (2007) proposed the Job Demands-Resources model (JD-R)Surface acting normally leads to negative behavioural outcomes. Surface acting depletes one's mental resources, which may impair employees' task performance. In contrast, deep acting yields authentic emotional displays that would benefit employees' behavioural outcomes. Bakker and Demerouti (2007) proposed the Job Demands-Resources model (JD-R)</p>
        <p>to theorise how job demands and resources jointly impact employees' behaviours and performance. According to JD-R, performing emotional labour is part of employees' emotional job demands and employees have limited resources (e.g., experience or knowledge) to manage such demands. Therefore, high emotional demands could exhaust employees' resources and decrease service quality (e.g., Karatepe, Haktanir, &amp; Yorganci, 2010). In contrast, deep acting could restore employees' personal resources (e.g., energy or intrinsic motivation) by enhancing positive affect and the likelihood of a positive interpersonal interaction with customers (Côté, 2005). Thus, employees performing deep acting are more energetic and enthusiastic to serve customers, resulting in higher service performance (Chi, Grandey, Diamond, &amp; Krimmel, 2011). Equivalently, emotional labour strategies not only impact employees' in-role performance, but also their OCBs, or proactive/extra-role performance (e.g., Prentice, Chen, &amp; King, 2013). Similarly, based on COR, Lee et al. (2018) examined the relation between emotional labour and customer-oriented behaviours among airline employees. They found that surface acting influenced customer-oriented behaviours negatively and deep acting affected customer-oriented behaviours positively.to theorise how job demands and resources jointly impact employees' behaviours and performance.

        <p>Furthermore, emotional labour strategies influence employee's creativity. Creativity inherently requires one's motivation in pursuit of new approaches to solve problems and to persistently proceed with changes (Zhou &amp; George, 2003). This suggests that service providers need to secure sufficient resources and invest a large amount of the resources to develop creative ideas. However, engaging in surface acting could deplete employees' motivational energy, therefore they cannot help neglecting the more challenging aspects of the job, which eventually reduces their levels of creativity (Shin, Hur, &amp; Oh, 2015). On the contrary, employees performing deep acting can restore their resources to develop creative ideas, which can lead to greater levels of creativity. Lee and Ok (2014) found that surface acting positively influenced CWB (e.g., service sabotage) among hotel employees. These results were explained using COR theory. Surface acting was conceptualised as a source of CWB because regulating emotions by suppressing expressions depletes resources that can be used to provide service, particularly during difficult interactions. This resource depletion increases the probability of later unethical or counterproductive behaviours (Lee &amp; Ok, 2014). In contrast, deep acting is expected to negatively predict CWB, and in the hospitality literature, Deng, Walter, Lam, and Zhao (2017) found that deep acting is negatively related to employees' ego depletion, which, in turn, indirectly alleviates CWB. Thus, based on the above discussion, we hypothesise that:Furthermore, emotional labour strategies influence employee's creativity.

        <p>Surface acting involves inauthentic emotional displays, which may be detected by the customers involving in the service interaction, thus surface acting may impair employees' job performance and hinders employee-customer rapport that is key to customer satisfaction (Hülsheger &amp; Schewe, 2011). Therefore, surface acting may decrease the likelihood of exceeding customers' expectations or receiving large tips. In contrast, deep acting brings in authentic emotional displays that would facilitate interpersonal interactions. Displaying positive moods to customers helps employees communicate important social information to customers and impact customers' attitudes and behaviours (i.e., customer satisfaction and tipping behaviour). Deep-acting employees are more likely to exceed customers' expectations than surface acting, which enhances generosity and tips provided by the customers (Chi et al., 2011).Surface acting involves inauthentic emotional displays, which may be detected by the customers involving in the service interaction, thus surface acting may impair employees' job performance and hinders employee-customer rapport that is key to customer satisfaction (Hülsheger &amp; Schewe, 2011).

        <p>Building on the emotion as social information model (EASI model;van Kleef, 2009), Hülsheger, Lang, Schewe, and Zijlstra (2015) found that deep acting is positively related to customer tips, based on a sample of Dutch bar and restaurant waiters and taxi-drivers. The EASI model focusses on the interpersonal functions of emotions and argues that emotional expressions send key information to observers, which therefore, impact the observers' behaviours through inferential and emotional contagion processes. Deep acting yields authentic emotional displays, and this could facilitate inferential and affective processes and enhance customers' willingness to reward service employees with a higher tip than surface acting. In the hospitality and tourism literature, research has shown that engaging in deep acting elicits more favourable reactions from the customers, helps establish a stronger employee-customer rapport and receive a higher tip than surface acting (e.g., Chi et al., 2011;Hülsheger et al., 2015;Medler-Liraz, 2014). Therefore, we hypothesise that:Building on the emotion as social information model (EASI model;van Kleef, 2009), Hülsheger, Lang, Schewe, and Zijlstra (2015) found that deep acting is positively related to customer tips, based on a sample of Dutch bar and restaurant waiters and taxi-drivers.

        <p>As aforementioned, according to COR (Hobfoll, 1989), service employees invest a lot of their energy to meet the emotional demands of the job with the expectation of obtaining positive outcomes as a response such as a rewarding relationship with customers, and they may experience strain if the recompense is not followed (Shin et al., 2015). Employees' experienced strain can be manifested in the form of emotional exhaustion, burnout, fatigue, etc. (Nohe, Meier, Sonntag, &amp; Michel, 2015). Employees performing surface acting usually experience unrewarding encounters with their customers, so they may suffer from strain. In fact, literature has consistently discovered that surface acting leads to strain such as emotional exhaustion or fatigue (e.g., Beal, Trougakos, Weiss, &amp; Dalal, 2013;Newnham, 2017). In contrast, deep acting produces genuine and authentic displays of emotions (Grandey, 2000). When employees authentically show positive affect via deep acting, customers may respond to them more favourably, restoring the employees' resources and decreasing levels of strain (Xu et al., 2017a).As aforementioned, according to COR (Hobfoll, 1989), service employees invest a lot of their energy to meet the emotional demands of the job with the expectation of obtaining positive outcomes as a response such as a rewarding relationship with customers, and they may experience strain if the recompense is not followed (Shin et al., 2015).

        <p>Strain could also link emotional labour strategies to a variety of outcomes and Hobfoll's (1989) COR theory was most often used to provide a theoretical explanation to why emotional labour can lead to various outcomes through employee strain. Such an indirect effect is also consistent with stressor-strain-outcomes model (Lazarus, 1966;Koeske &amp; Koeske, 1993), in which surface acting is a stressor, activating stress arousal, taxing the body and inducing jobbased strain over time, then evoking coping strategies to protect resources, such as quitting and engaging in CWB, etc. Empirical studies in hospitality and tourism literature support those linkages. For example, Kim et al. (2012) examined how emotional labour affects service recovery performance among hotel employees via emotional exhaustion. The findings revealed that surface acting was emotionally exhaustive, which negatively influenced service recovery performance. In contrast, deep acting reduces emotional exhaustion and positively influenced service recovery performance. Lee and Ok (2012) found an indirect effect of surface acting on job satisfaction via emotional exhaustion. In addition, Lv, Xu, Ji (2012) found that emotional exhaustion mediated the relation between surface/deep acting and intention to quit. These studies suggest that employees experience various consequences (e.g., job satisfaction, turnover intentions, service performance, etc.) when performing emotional labour strategies through strain.

The psychometric meta-analytical methods developed by Hunter and Schmidt (2004) are commonly applied to conduct meta-analyses in organisational behaviour and strategic management (e.g., Hülsheger &amp; Schewe, 2011;Karna, Richter, &amp; Riesenkampff, 2016). For the purpose of this study, we used the individual-correction metaanalysis (Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004, pp.75-136) to estimate the mean value of correlations between antecedents and outcomes. We coded the correlation matrix and the sample size of each article that we collected. In synthesizing the correlation coefficients between antecedents and outcomes, the psychometric meta-analysis uses sample sizes as weights and adjusts for the sampling variances of the correlations.</p>
        <p>Meta-analytic SEM. Meta-analytic structural equation modelling (
            <rs type="software">MASEM</rs>, or meta-SEM) is popular with applied psychology studies (e.g., Bamberg &amp; Möser, 2007;Colquitt et al., 2013). It is a technique that pools correlation coefficients of a set of variables from several independent samples, so as to fit structural equation models in the pooled matrix (Jak &amp; Cheung, 2018). This method is introduced and reviewed by Cheung (2015), Jak (2015) and Landis (2013). It can synthesise the individual causal links among variables into a single, combined model. Specifically, we follow the adapted the two-stage structural equation modelling (TSSEM) OC approach described in Jak (2015) and Jak and Cheung (2018). The data used are the individual correlation matrix and the sample size of each article that we collected. The estimation process contains two steps. In the first step, a pooled correlation matrix is estimated, and in the second step, a structural equation model is fitted on this matrix in order to explain the pooled correlations (Jak, 2015, pp.21-30). The OC approach stands for omitted correlation approach. When carrying out the estimation, for each missing correlation coefficient in a study, an arbitrary value (i.e., the average correlation across studies) is plugged in. This approach has been evaluated to perform quite stable across missing data conditions (Jak &amp; Cheung, 2018).

        <p>We categorise the antecedents into five groups: personality, emotional intelligence, customer orientation, social support, and display rules. Hypotheses 1 predicts that neuroticism is positively associated with surface acting, and extraversion is positively associated with deep acting.

        <p>While Tables 2 and3 show the direct relations between emotional labour and its antecedents and outcomes, we are also keen to understand the mediating process through which emotional labour results in the various outcomes. By using meta-SEM, we combine casual links in a single model and explore the relationships that do not necessarily have been studied in prior literature. The stressor-strain-outcomes framework (Koeske &amp; Koeske, 1993) indicates that strain may be a potential mediator in linking the stressors (emotional labour in this study) to our outcome variables.While Tables 2 and3 show the direct relations between emotional labour and its antecedents and outcomes, we are also keen to understand the mediating process through which emotional labour results in the various outcomes.

        <p>This paper is the first meta-analysis of the antecedents and outcomes of emotional labour in the hospitality and tourism industry. With regard to the antecedents, a general pattern we discover in their correlation with emotional labour is that three of them (personality, customer orientation, and emotional display rules) have a stronger correlation with deep acting than with surface acting, and the other two of the antecedents (emotional intelligence and social support) are not correlated with surface acting. The findings indicate that employees engage in surface acting for complicated reasons. For example, on one side, employees high in emotional intelligence may find it easy to take the customers' perspectives, which reduces their needs to resort to surface acting; on the other side, high emotional intelligence employees may also intentionally use surface acting to save their energy and resources. Employees who get more social support may still turn to surface acting frequently because the supportive environment may make them feel safe to use the superficial strategy and they will not be punished even their faked smile is detected by the customers.This paper is the first meta-analysis of the antecedents and outcomes of emotional labour in the hospitality and tourism industry.

        <p>In addition, deep acting shows a consistent positive correlation with all our antecedents, which indicates that deep acting is more predictable by hiring extravert, emotionally intelligent, and customer-oriented employees, clearly addressing the positive emotional display rules, and providing social support to employees. We find a positive relationship between negative display rules and deep acting. Suppressing negative emotions has been frequently associated with surface acting since telling employees what not to express is likely to evoke employees' response-focused emotional regulation-surface acting (Kammeyer-Mueller et al., 2013). Our finding shows that suppressing negative emotions may not only be linked to faking the desired emotions, it can also serve as a first step before employees change their internal feelings, make themselves happy, and act in good faith when interacting with customers. Thus, our metaanalytical results offer an interesting perspective on negative display rules, which indicates that it can either result in the action of faking positive expressions (Diefendorff, Croyle, &amp; Gosserand, 2005) or help to eliminate employees' negative feelings and facilitate their change of their real emotions.In addition, deep acting shows a consistent positive correlation with all our antecedents, which indicates that deep acting is more predictable by hiring extravert, emotionally intelligent, and customer-oriented employees, clearly addressing the positive emotional display rules, and providing social support to employees.

        <p>With regard to the consequences, as we predict, deep acting shows a positive effect on the attitudinal, behavioural, and customer-related outcomes, with a strong correlation with customer-oriented behaviour. Contrary to our hypothesis, surface acting is not negatively related to customer-oriented behaviour. The reason might be that although employees' true feelings remain unchanged, their action of faking the emotions according to the display rules is also customer-oriented and may meet customers' expectation to some extent (Mesmer-Magnus, DeChurch, &amp; Wax, 2012).With regard to the consequences, as we predict, deep acting shows a positive effect on the attitudinal, behavioural, and customer-related outcomes, with a strong correlation with customer-oriented behaviour.

        <p>We find that both surface acting and deep acting are not related to OCB. This result may be due to the following reasons: first, the job nature of hospitality employees makes it difficult to define in-role and extra-role behaviours (Bienstock, DeMoranville, &amp; Smith, 2003).We find that both surface acting and deep acting are not related to OCB.

        <p>Second, although deep acting may create a positive climate which encourages interpersonal helping and extra contribution to the organisation, it might also consume employees' resources which could be used for OCB; for surface acting, it may become a habitual behaviour which is not necessarily associated with depleting employees' resources for OCB. In addition, the construct of OCB consists different dimensions, including behaviours toward individuals (altruism and courtesy) and behaviours toward the organisation (civic virtue and sportsmanship) (Hoffman, Blair, Meriac, &amp; Woehr, 2007). While altruism and courtesy are the intrapersonal behaviours which employees need to truly feel the positive emotions (deep acting) to enact the behaviours, and the resources needed for such behaviours might be depleted by surface acting; the behaviours toward the organisation may be considered as an organisational norm by the employees which they should be engaged in without emotional change (Ramachandran, Jordan, Troth, &amp; Lawrence, 2011). Similarly, the two types of emotional labour are not related to organisational commitmentt either. Employees' commitment to the organisation may not necessarily involve emotions. They may just treat commitment as a normative behaviour (normative commitment) or commit to the organisation because of high cost associated with leaving (continuance commitment).Second, although deep acting may create a positive climate which encourages interpersonal helping and extra contribution to the organisation, it might also consume employees' resources which could be used for OCB; for surface acting, it may become a habitual behaviour which is not necessarily associated with depleting employees' resources for OCB.

        <p>On the mediating effect of strain, in the additional meta-SEM analysis, we find that emotional labour strategies lead to employee strain, which in turn, predict various outcomes. This is consistent with previous findings in literature. For example, Prati, Liu, Perrewé and Ferris (2009) found that emotional labour is positively related to strain. Chen et al. (2012) also showed that strain mediated the effect of emotional labour on work performance. Although emotional labour is not significantly related to organisational commitment, its indirect effect on organisational commitment through strain becomes significant. That is, as a stressor in workplace, its potential association with strain might be attenuated by other factors (e.g., personality, supervisor or peer support). But in case the resource loss from emotional labour cannot be offset and strain is induced, employees' overall commitment to the organisation will be destroyed (Ramachandran et al., 2011).On the mediating effect of strain, in the additional meta-SEM analysis, we find that emotional labour strategies lead to employee strain, which in turn, predict various outcomes.

        <p>The present study contributes to emotional labour literature in hospitality and tourism management in the following ways. First, this paper provides a comprehensive, theory-driven meta-analysis on the predictors, as well as costs and benefits of emotional labour by statistically testing the key dispositional and organisational contextual antecedents, the attitudinal, behavioural, and customer-related outcomes of emotional labour, as well as the mediating role of strain in the relation between emotional labour and the outcomes. The meta-analysis allows for a finer grained examination of the previously proposed antecedents and outcomes of emotional labour, and additional analyses on how emotional labour leads to the outcome variables. Although research in emotional labour has grown rapidly, the findings in extant studies have been mixed and inconsistent (Kammeyer-Mueller et al., 2013). As the first metaanalysis of emotional labour in hospitality and tourism, our research contributes to literature by clarifying the consistent results and the consensus which have been reached in existing literature, underlining the inconsistent findings and interpretations, and establishing a strong empirical foundation for future scholars to improve the existing framework or to look for more dynamic theoretical frameworks.The present study contributes to emotional labour literature in hospitality and tourism management in the following ways.

        <p>Second, we contribute to various theories related to emotional labour by providing further empirical confirmation and highlighting the gaps of current research. The positive correlations we find between neuroticism and surface acting, and between extraversion and deep acting, show the effectiveness of broaden-and-build theory in the emotional labour context. The positive effect of emotional intelligence and customer orientation on deep acting and the negative effect of customer orientation on surface acting further confirm COR theory by highlighting emotional intelligence and customer orientation as personal resources that can help facilitate employees' deep acting. The proximal (strain) and distal (attitudinal, behavioural, and customer-related outcomes) effects of emotional labour strategies provide additional support the application of COR theory in emotional labour literature. Deep acting has been consistently showed to enhance people's resources, and thereby reduce strain and lead to positive outcomes; while surface acting depletes resources, creates strain, and leads to negative outcomes. The consistent empirical support for broaden-and-build theory and COR theory we find in this meta-analysis suggests that future research can introduce and test more relevant predictors and outcomes of emotional labour based on these theories. We also confirm AET theory in emotional labour by considering social support as the affective event that induces affect-driven behaviours (surface acting and deep acting), and further impacts employees' attitudinal and behavioural outcomes. However, no study from hospitality and tourism journals has investigated discrete emotions as a function in employee-customer interactions. This represents a research gap as AET suggests that events/work-related situations lead to discrete emotions (e.g. joy or fear), which in turn could influence one's emotional labour strategy.Second, we contribute to various theories related to emotional labour by providing further empirical confirmation and highlighting the gaps of current research.

        <p>Third, the counterintuitive findings from our analysis may have significant implications for the measurement of deep acting and surface acting. We surprisingly find a positive relationship between negative display rules and deep acting, as well as a nonsignificant relationship between the two emotional labour strategies and organisational commitment and OCB. While we have explained the possible reasons for these interesting results, the measurement of emotional labour might be another explanation. Both deep acting and surface acting can be used by service employees to amplify their positive emotions and supress their negative emotions (Holman, Martınez-Inigo, &amp; Totterdell, 2008); while the current measurement of deep acting and surface acting does not distinguish between amplification and suppression. The negative display rules may have a different relationship with deep acting by amplifying the positive emotions from deep acting by supressing the negative emotions; and amplification and suppression may have different impacts on OCB and organisational commitment. Therefore, our meta-analysis indicates that developing a more fine-grained measurement of deep acting and surface acting might help to explain the inconsistent findings.Third, the counterintuitive findings from our analysis may have significant implications for the measurement of deep acting and surface acting.

Both deep acting and surface acting can be used by service employees to amplify their positive emotions and supress their negative emotions (Holman, Martınez-Inigo, &amp; Totterdell, 2008); while the current measurement of deep acting and surface acting does not distinguish between amplification and suppression. The negative display rules may have a different relationship with deep acting by amplifying the positive emotions from deep acting by supressing the negative emotions; and amplification and suppression may have different impacts on OCB and organisational commitment. Therefore, our meta-analysis indicates that developing a more fine-grained measurement of deep acting and surface acting might help to explain the inconsistent findings.</p>
        <p>Finally, our findings show that deep acting and surface acting should be differentiated by researchers and practitioners. We found a positive effect of deep acting on the outcome variables, which is consistent with the existing theoretical framework and empirical studies in the field (Hülsheger &amp; Schewe, 2011). Although surface acting is found to be positively related to customer-orientation behaviour and tips, it shows a negative correlation with most of the beneficial outcomes (e.g., job satisfaction, service performance, creativity, customer satisfaction), and a positive correlation with turnover intention and CWB. Therefore, surface acting is ineffective and is normally detrimental to employees, organisations, and customers.Finally, our findings show that deep acting and surface acting should be differentiated by researchers and practitioners.

        <p>Hospitality and tourism organisations should promote deep acting among their service employees. Organisations may not only require employees to display certain emotions, but also help employees to adjust their inner feelings. Training on the philosophy of "service with a real smile" needs to be implemented to help employees better understand customers' needs and expectations. Employees can also be advised that deep acting not only benefits customers through good service, but also improves their own service quality and well-being. In addition, we have also identified a mediating role of strain in the relationship between emotional labour and outcomes. This suggests that organisations could use intervening mechanisms, such as regularly encouraging meditative breaks (Richardson &amp; Rothstein, 2008) and mindfulnessbased stress reduction programmes (Grossman et al., 2004), to help employees reduce their strain, which would improve service quality and enhance employee well-being.Hospitality and tourism organisations should promote deep acting among their service employees.

        <p>Although the current study offers a number of important insights into emotional labour in the hospitality and tourism industry, the following limitations should be taken into account when drawing conclusions from our paper. First, we use the traditional categorisation of surface acting and deep acting for emotional labour to get enough sample empirical studies to conduct our meta-analysis. Despite the recent progress in introducing the genuine expression of emotions as third type of emotional labour, only very few empirical studies in hospitality has included this dimension (Nart et al., 2019). Future meta-analysis in emotional labour, when genuine emotional expression has been examined more extensively, may include it as an emotional labour strategy and investigate its antecedents and consequences. Moreover, emotional labour may not be a dichotomous variable and future theoretical and empirical research may take into consideration the possible co-occurrence of surface acting and deep acting.Although the current study offers a number of important insights into emotional labour in the hospitality and tourism industry, the following limitations should be taken into account when drawing conclusions from our paper.

        <p>Second, most of the primary studies in our meta-analysis are cross-sectional surveys with self-reported data. Therefore, our meta-analysis results might be inflated by common method bias (Podsakoff et al., 2003) and we cannot make causal inferences about the antecedents and outcomes of emotional labour. The reversed causality from the consequences to emotional labour or from emotional labour to the antecedents is possible. For example, a reverse effect that job satisfaction leads to more deep acting is possible. We thereby call for more longitudinal study in hospitality industry to show the causal pathways from antecedents to emotional labour and from emotional labour to outcome variables. In addition, we encourage future researchers to collect information on customer-rated performance to make the findings more solid and convincing. Third, we have not included moderators in our analysis. The nonsignificant correlation between emotional labour and some variables (e.g., emotional intelligence and surface acting, social support and surface acting, etc.) indicates that there might be some important contextual variables that can moderate the relationship we examined, or variables such as emotional intelligence and social support may be the potential moderators. A couple of research in emotional labour has incorporated contextual factors such as supervisory support and personorganisation fit in studying the extent to which the antecedents influence emotional labour and emotional labour influences outcomes (e.g., Chen et al., 2012;Lam, Huo, &amp; Chen, 2018).Second, most of the primary studies in our meta-analysis are cross-sectional surveys with self-reported data.

        <p>Future research is encouraged to investigate the potential contextual factors that may impact the relationships in our proposed theoretical framework, including service climate, leadership, employees' coping style, etc.Future research is encouraged to investigate the potential contextual factors that may impact the relationships in our proposed theoretical framework, including service climate, leadership, employees' coping style, etc.</p>
        <p>Finally, although we are able to conduct meta-analysis to test an integrated framework on emotional labour by aggregating and evaluating the correlations from various studies, only a small number of studies are available for some of our study variables (e.g., tips and customer satisfaction). The limited number of studies may impact the accuracy of meta-analytic estimates. However, according to Schmidt et al. (1985), even meta-analyses with small number of studies could help us to gain meaningful and insightful ideas into the relationships among constructs and are worthwhile being conducted (see also Hülsheger and Schewe, 2011;Valentine et al., 2010).Finally, although we are able to conduct meta-analysis to test an integrated framework on emotional labour by aggregating and evaluating the correlations from various studies, only a small number of studies are available for some of our study variables (e.g., tips and customer satisfaction).

        <p>In conclusion, based on a meta-analysis of 57 usable correlation matrices published in journals until 2019, this paper confirms the significant effect of personality, emotional intelligence, customer orientation, social support, and display rules on emotional labour strategies, as well as the effect of emotional labour strategies on the attitudinal, behavioural, and customer-related outcomes. In addition, strain is demonstrated to mediate the relationship between emotional labour strategies and the various outcomes. Our meta-analysis shows the individual and contextual causes of emotional labour, as well as the potential beneficial effect of deep acting and detrimental effect of surface acting, which has significant theoretical and practical implications for scholars and managerial professionals in hospitality and tourism industry.In conclusion, based on a meta-analysis of 57 usable correlation matrices published in journals until 2019, this paper confirms the significant effect of personality, emotional intelligence, customer orientation, social support, and display rules on emotional labour strategies, as well as the effect of emotional labour strategies on the attitudinal, behavioural, and customer-related outcomes.

        <p>This paper also provides implications for practitioners. First of all, this paper suggests that hospitality and tourism practitioners investing in selecting and training employees could have positive impacts. For example, given their positive effect on deep acting, extraversion, emotional intelligence and customer orientation can be the preferred qualities that organisations in hospitality and tourism industry look for in a candidate during recruitment. Our metaanalysis on the antecedents of emotional labour shows that customer orientation and positive emotional display rule has a moderate to strong correlation with deep acting while all other correlations are considered as small to moderate, according to Cohen's (1988) rule of thumb.This paper also provides implications for practitioners.

        <p>The significant effect of positive display rules is in line with the findings of prior research which suggests that emotional labour can be trained (Grandey, 2003).The significant effect of positive display rules is in line with the findings of prior research which suggests that emotional labour can be trained (Grandey, 2003).</p>
        <p>Furthermore, organisations should strengthen employees' awareness of the display rules by explicitly communicating the expectation and standard, and such expectation may be enforced through supervision. The significant correlation between social support and deep acting in our meta-analysis shows that supervisor and peer support should be encouraged, especially in hospitality and tourism organisations. The support employees get from the organisations may play a contagious role for motivating employees to engage in deep acting with customers. For example, a supportive climate with considerate, respect, and socioemotional support among the organisation can be contagious to employees' sincere attitude and deep acting in interacting with customers (Ortiz-Bonnín, García-Buades, Caballer, &amp; Zapf, 2016). Moreover, organisations can suggest both supervisor and coworkers to provide positive feedback to one another, and such positive feedback can be considered as a kind of resource for promoting deep acting (Yoo &amp; Arnold, 2015). In addition, pairing employees with a supervisor or peer mentor may help employees better recognise the necessity and better understand the skills of deep acting.Furthermore, organisations should strengthen employees' awareness of the display rules by explicitly communicating the expectation and standard, and such expectation may be enforced through supervision.
