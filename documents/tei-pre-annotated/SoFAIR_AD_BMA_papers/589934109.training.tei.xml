        <p>A recent focus on the development of biobased polymer packaging films has come about in response to the environmental hazards caused by petroleum-based, nonbiodegradable packaging materials. Among biopolymers, chitosan is one of the most popular due to its biocompatibility, biodegradability, antibacterial properties, and ease of use. Due to its ability to inhibit gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, yeast, and foodborne filamentous fungi, chitosan is a suitable biopolymer for developing food packaging. However, more than the chitosan is required for active packaging. In this review, we summarize chitosan composites which show active packaging and improves food storage condition and extends its shelf life. Active compounds such as essential oils and phenolic compounds with chitosan are reviewed. Moreover, composites with polysaccharides and various nanoparticles are also summarized. This review provides valuable information for selecting a composite that enhances shelf life and other functional qualities when embedding chitosan. Furthermore, this report will provide directions for the development of novel biodegradable food packaging materials.A recent focus on the development of biobased polymer packaging films has come about in response to the environmental hazards caused by petroleum-based, nonbiodegradable packaging materials.

        <p>Products made from synthetic plastics, such as disposable grocery bags, are used daily. However, negative consequences of the nonrenewable, petroleum-based synthetic plastics have become increasingly known [1,2]. Synthetic plastics are nonbiodegradable and can take thousands of years to decompose. Although these synthetic polymers can be recycled, most end up in landfills or oceans where pollution can significantly damage the local ecosystem.Products made from synthetic plastics, such as disposable grocery bags, are used daily.

        <p>The synthetic plastics used in food packaging are environmentally unfriendly and we have begun to explore biodegradable packaging materials. Therefore, the food industry is searching for the possibility of using biodegradable materials derived from natural sources such as cellulose and its derivatives, chitosan, starch, alginate, pectin, pullulan, gelatin, whey, soybean proteins, etc. Bacterial cellulose and other plant-derived celluloses have been used as food packaging materials, but they do not have any functional or mechanical properties. Alginate exhibits good tensile strength, good film-forming abilities, and flexibility, but it has the major drawback of a high water vapor transmission rate [3]. Gelatin is also well known for its film-forming ability but is limited to mechanical properties and thermal stability [4]. Among these biopolymers, chitosan and its derivatives have excellent film-forming properties, nontoxicity, biodegradability, antibacterial, antifungal, and metal-chelating characteristics [5]. Thus, the demand for chitin and chitosan has increased [6,7].The synthetic plastics used in food packaging are environmentally unfriendly and we have begun to explore biodegradable packaging materials.

        <p>Chitosan is a polysaccharide found in crustacean shells that can be manufactured via the deacetylation of chitin (Scheme 1) [8]. As an alternative material, chitosan shows potential applications in many industries, such as food, agriculture, and medicine. Chitosan films and coatings have been extensively studied because they are non-toxic, antimicrobial, biodegradable, and produced from a renewable source [9,10]. The film is generally obtained using the casting method, where chitosan dissolves in a suitable solvent and simultaneously incorporates the plasticizer, the active compound, and the nanofiller of interest. Chitosan possesses antibacterial properties due to positively charged amino groups (NH 3 + ) at the C-2 positions in the glucose monomers.Chitosan is a polysaccharide found in crustacean shells that can be manufactured via the deacetylation of chitin (Scheme 1) [8].

However, the antimicrobial activity of chitosan is still unknown and several mechanisms have been hypothesized [22]. Research shows that chitosan exhibits higher bacteriostasis than fungistasis at low temperatures (-20 • C) [24]. A hypothesized antimicrobial mechanism is that chitosan-based films form a cellophane-like structure to build a protective layer on the food surface to block external microbes [25]. The protective layer of chitosanbased films may also restrict oxygen permeability to inhibit the growth of bacteria within the food [26]. Another antimicrobial mechanism includes the adsorption of the chitosan polymers on the surface of the microbes to cause a blockage. + groups that can interact with the negatively charged phosphoryl groups leading to intercellular electrolyte leakage and killing the bacteria [27][28][29]. Chitosan can also inhibit microbes from replicating by penetrating the nuclei, binding to the DNA, and preventing the synthesis of RNA [30]. Finally, chitosan can chelate essential nutrients and metals, rendering them unavailable for microbes [20].Chitosan shows antimicrobial activity against various microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and algae [22].

        <p>Chitosan obtained from the deacetylation of chitin is a waste product of the seafood industry. The film-forming ability allows chitosan to form an edible coating or films that can improve the preservation of food products. Interactions between the cationic chitosan film microorganisms' negatively charged membrane prevent bacteria and fungi's growth. Pristine chitosan films have been studied for years as a potential food packaging material. However, recent research on chitosan includes chitosan-based composite films, which contain different functional components to improve the properties of films.Chitosan obtained from the deacetylation of chitin is a waste product of the seafood industry.

        <p>Natural essential oils extracted from plants have potential applications as environmentally friendly food preservatives in edible films. Adding essential oil to polymers increases the films' antibacterial and antifungal activity [26,31]. Moreover, the essential oil in chitosan-based films regulates the release rate of antimicrobial agents to maintain the concentration of active compounds over an extended time. Essential oils include between 85 and 99% volatile substances, such as terpenes, terpenoids, and other alpha-aromatic and aromatic substances, and between 1 and 15% non-volatile substances; these substances are frequently utilized in the food sector [32].Natural essential oils extracted from plants have potential applications as environmentally friendly food preservatives in edible films.

        <p>On that basis, ginger essential oil (GEO) obtained from ginger enhanced the physiochemical properties of chitosan and fish sarcoplasmic protein (FSP) film. All the GEO/FSP/ chitosan composite films exhibited excellent UV-barrier properties from 200 to 280 nm, decreased tensile strength, and higher elongation at break compared to pristine chitosan film. The composite film prolonged the shelf life of fillets by two days and enhanced the antimicrobial activity of chitosan films. Additionally, GEO was slowly released onto the surface of the fish to improve preservation [33]. Another chitosan-based composite film that contained essential oil of fennel (EOF), potato peel extract (PPE), and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) improved the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of the film. The nano chitosan-PPE-PVA-EOF composite film enhanced mechanical properties and extended the shelf life of food. The composite film degraded entirely within two days by Pseudomonas putida while the chitosan control film took about one week [34]. Furthermore, composite films based on chitosan and honeysuckle flower extract (HFE) enhanced antioxidant activity, antimicrobial activity, and reduced water vapor permeability (WVP). With the addition of HFE (30%), the DPPH scavenging activity and E. coli inhibition zone increased. However, mechanical tests showed that incorporating HFE reduced the tensile strength and elongation at break.

        <p>The essential oil extracted from cinnamon has been getting attention due to its antimicrobial properties. Octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) and gum arabic (GA) stabilized with cinnamon essential (CEO) can be incorporated into chitosan-based films to increase the emulsion capacity of OSA and GA. CEO emulsions into the chitosan films improved antimicrobial activity against E. coli and S. aureus. However, it reduced the tensile strength of the film. The OSA-GA stabilized CEO emulsions into CS films could be used to protect edible films and increase durability (Figure 1) [36]. Similarly, chitosan film containing thyme essential oil enhanced the film's mechanical, thermal, and antibacterial properties. Moreover, combing of calcium chloride, zinc oxide (ZnO), poly ethylene glycol (PEG), and nano clay (NC) in chitosan-based films preserved the quality of sweet cherries by conserving higher titratable acidity, total soluble solids, and reduced weight loss [37].The essential oil extracted from cinnamon has been getting attention due to its antimicrobial properties.

The pit morphology of chitosan films increased as the concentration of GFSE increased due to the incorporation of glycerol in the GFSE. These pits facilitate the release of GFSE out of the composite films and can suppress microbial growth.

Moreover, composite chitosan films with 15% GSE inhibited the total mesophilic aerobic bacteria and coliform foods [46]. The GSE with poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) and chitosan was reported as an antimicrobial packaging for food by inhibiting the growth of E. coli and mold, respectively. The pit morphology of chitosan films increased as the concentration of GFSE increased due to the incorporation of glycerol in the GFSE. These pits facilitate the release of GFSE out of the composite films and can suppress microbial growth. The GFSE chitosan composite films still exhibited adequate tensile strength and flexibility but decreased the film's resistance to breakage and elasticity. Furthermore, no mold growth was observed on the bread packaged with films containing GFSE (Figure 2) [47]. Another polyphenol group from kombucha tea (KT) embedded with chitosan films improved antimicrobial and antioxidant activities, extending the shelf life and lowering the minced beef's lipid oxidation by three days. KT significantly enhanced the antioxidant activity of chitosan-based films. Food packaging material should ideally exhibit low light transmittance. UV-vis spectroscopy analysis between 300 nm and 800 nm determined KT significantly decreased UV and visible light's transmittance. Adding KT also considerably increased the water solubility and reduced the water vapor permeability of chitosan films [1]. Karača et al. fabricated an edible film that contained coca (Theobroma cacao L.) powder using chitosan, alginate, and pectin with whey protein. The resultant plain alginate films exhibited the highest elongation at break. Adding proteins caused the release of polyphenols to be prolonged and enhanced the functional properties. The plain alginate and pectin films exhibited the highest total phenol content (TPC) compared to chitosan-based films, alginate-and pectin-based films. Further, the sensory score was reported to be highest in alginate-based edible films based on acceptability, appearance, color, transparency, and elasticity [48].

The WC (beeswax-chitosan emulsion coated) and CC (chitosan coated) paper reduced yeast and mold growth by 8 to 12 days, depending on the temperature. In addition, the enhanced barrier properties against air and moisture are attributed to better bread quality [54]. The chitosan/cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) exhibited antimicrobial activity against the gram-negative, gram-positive bacterial, and fungicidal activity.

        <p>In the continuous growth of biodegradable materials, starch shows the potential to develop active food packaging material due to its low cost, availability, functionality, and, most importantly, biodegradability. Starch-based films are often odorless, tasteless, colorless, nontoxic, and biodegradable. However, compared to synthetic polymers, starch films have poor mechanical and barrier qualities, restricting their use in food packaging. Therefore, scientists have been investigating retaining starch characteristics by blending with the other natural biopolymers. The intermolecular bonds between the amino functional groups of chitosan improved many food packaging properties such as tensile strength, thermal stability, hydrophobicity, water adsorption, and gas barrier properties [57]. Corn starch and chitosan film prepared via the casting method exhibited excellent elongation at break and tensile strength [58]. Thermoplastic corn starch (TPS) and chitosan oligomer (CO) composite films extended food shelf life. The chitosan oligomers diffused through the polymer towards the food surface acting as an antimicrobial agent. Results showed that the film could preserve perishable foods for one week.

Halim et al. showed that incorporating tannic acid into CS, gelatin, and methylcellulose (MC) increased the antibacterial properties of the composite film against E. coli and S. aureus. MC exhibited the lowest weight loss % while chitosan exhibited the highest. Additionally, the incorporation of tannic acid significantly reduced light transmittance which is a better preservative [79]. Combining nano-cellulose into chitosan, gelatin, and starch improved the anti-fungal, mechanical, and water barrier properties. With the chitosan amount, food preservation, Young's modulus, and tensile strength increased while the elongation at break decreased. However, Young's modulus and tensile strength decreased as the nanocellulose content increased. Additionally, composite films that contained starch nanocellulose were more brittle due to the rigid behavior of NCC compared to gelatin. Additionally, the nanocomposite film containing ~5% NCC content of starch-based film exhibited high transmittance of UV light [80]. Furthermore, the antibacterial performance of gelatin/chitosan film was enhanced by incorporating capsaicin (Cap) via FeIII doped hollow metal-organic framework (Fe III -HMOF-5) nanocarriers. Incorporating Cap-Fe III -HMOF-5 increased tensile strength and reduced elongation at break. Moreover, due to the hydrophilic properties of Cap-Fe III -HMOF-5, water vapor permeability decreased as the content increased (Figure 5) [81]. The gelatin/chitosan film improves the physical and mechanical properties, depicted in Table 2.</p>
        <p>Food packages containing chitosan kept the food fresh without a freezer for some time while degrading and preventing future soil pollution. However, the fast dissolution in acidic solution and lack of flexibility of chitosan films are its drawbacks. Therefore, creating an affordable, biodegradable polymer film for food packaging is essential. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) has numerous advantages for food packaging, including high hydrophilicity, outstanding chemical stability, and exceptional film-forming abilities. Therefore, the current research on the composite of PVA with chitosan is gaining attention. Hydrogen bonding can cause entanglements between PVA and quaternary ammonium chitosan (QAC), forming a composite film with enhanced mechanical properties [83]. A study by Hu et al. showed that the QAC/PVA composite film significantly increased water vapor permeability, tensile strength, and elongation at break. The films reduced peroxide levels and thiobarbituric acid levels in peanut oil and stored it for 28 days at 37 • C [84]. Similarly, the composite of PVA, chitosan, and various levels of D-Limonene (DL) film exhibited the most optimal tensile strength and water vapor permeability. The composite films also inhibited E. coli and S. aureus growth and increased the shelf life of mangoes. The film significantly slowed the decay process (Figure 6) [85].Food packages containing chitosan kept the food fresh without a freezer for some time while degrading and preventing future soil pollution.

Moreover, the antimicrobial properties against E. coli and B. subtillis were also contributed to by the incorporation of GO [109]. A laser-induced micropore-based modified atmosphere packaging and carbon-dot/chitosan coat exhibited good preservation of food flavor components such as alcohol, ketones, and aldehydes [110]. The MMT-CuO nanocomposites had little effect on the transparency of the films and increased the tensile strength and percent elongation. As a result, chitosan-MMT-CuO nanocomposite films have potential applications in active food packaging (Figure 8) [107]. A study by Yan et al. showed that the α-tocopherol-chitosan nanoparticles/chitosan/montmorillonite (TOC-CSNPs/CS/MMT) composite films can be used for food packaging applications with improved physiochemical properties and antioxidant activity. The water solubility of the TOC-CSNPs/CS/MMT composite films decreased with the TOC-CSNP content. Films with 10% TOC-CSNP exhibited the lowest water solubility. Furthermore, the swelling ratio decreased as the TOC-CSNP content increased. Antioxidant evaluation of the composite films found that the composite films exhibited significantly higher radical scavenging activity than CS/MMT and CS films [108].</p>
        <p>Recently, graphene has been utilized in the food packaging industry due to its potent antimicrobial properties. Graphene oxide (GO) has the unique property of being homogenously dispersed into chitosan polymer nanocomposite films.

Chitosan is substantially less expensive than other biopolymers since it is derived from a bio-waste product utilizing various energyefficient techniques. Chitosan, one of the polysaccharides, has undergone significant research and has been used to create biodegradable food packaging. Due to its antibacterial properties, chitosan is frequently utilized as antimicrobial films, edible protective coatings, dipping, and spraying for food items. Antimicrobial packaging is crucial, and can kill or inhibit food-contaminating pathogenic bacteria. Researchers have combined chitosan with other biopolymers and nanocomposites to improve mechanical properties, optical properties, barrier properties, and thermal stability. We have selected a few of the best composites with improved essential properties for food packaging in Table 3. However, more research is required to get this biopolymer to industrial levels for food packaging applications. A few aspects should be considered for future developments as follows: (i) degradation of the films in the real environment; (ii) the toxicity of chitosan-based film; and (iii) active and intelligent packaging system. Over the past ten years, much work has gone into creating and testing antimicrobial films to increase food safety and shelf life. This review briefly overviews recent developments in creating chitosan composite films for food packaging.The awareness of environmental problems caused by plastic packaging has increased interest in environmentally friendly packaging materials.
