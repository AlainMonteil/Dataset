        <p>In 2008, the World Health Organization (WHO) introduced the MPOWER policy package, a series of technical measures and resources to assist country-level implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), developed in response to the globalization of the tobacco epidemic. The first of these technical measures involves the monitoring of prevention policies and tobacco use. 1 Several national surveillance systems are available to monitor smoking prevalence and trends in most countries. 2 However, data from country-specific populations are poorly comparable, since they are not collected using a standardized study design -including sampling methods, mode of interviewing and questionnaires -which represents a prerequisite for valid comparisons of smoking prevalence and smoking patterns across different countries. 3,4 To the best of our knowledge, the only standardized and representative investigations which systematically monitor smoking prevalence among adults in more than one European country, are the WHO Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS), 5,6 the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), 7 and the European Commission (EC) Special Eurobarometers. [8][9][10] GATS covers three European Union (EU) member states (MS; i.e., Greece, Poland and Romania); 5,6 SHARE is a longitudinal study, conducted in five waves between 2004 and 2013, collecting information on smoking habit, among individuals aged 50 years and older from 20 European countries, 7 Eurobarometer is a representative survey conducted in all the 28 EU MS on approximately 1,000 face-to-face interviews per country, based on selected thematic studies. The most recent Eurobarometer surveys focusing on tobacco smoking indicated that the overall smoking prevalence in the EU had slightly decreased from 29% in 2009 to 26% in 2014, and remained stable until 2017. 8,9,11 Among the other tobacco control projects, the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Project (the ITC Project) includes longitudinal studies in 10 European countries. However, all these studies, including samples not representative of the general population or smokers only, cannot provide smoking prevalence estimates. 12 The above mentioned European surveillance systems are important and useful tools; however, they are not always able to investigate in-depth key tobacco control measures and smoking determinants. Consequently, a few specific studies, mainly supported by the EC, have been conducted to analyse this issue. 3,[13][14][15] These include, the PPACTE (Pricing Policies and Control of Tobacco in Europe) survey,</p>
        <p>conducted in 2010 to investigate the effectiveness of pricing policies on tobacco control in Europe, 3,16,17 and the present survey, conducted within the TackSHS Project (http://tackshs.eu), 18 aimed to improve understanding of exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke (SHS) and e-cigarette aerosol in Europe.</p>
        <p>In this paper we aimed to describe the TackSHS survey, a multi-country survey conducted in 2017-2018 in 12 EU MS, providing the main results on smoking prevalence and its correlates in Europe.</p>
        <p>The TackSHS survey 18 has been conducted in 12 strategically selected European Union countries (Bulgaria, England, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, and Spain), representing geographical, legislative and cultural variations across the EU. This cross-sectional study was coordinated by Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS (Mario Negri Institute; Milan, Italy). The fieldwork was conducted by DOXA, the Italian branch of the Worldwide Independent Network/Gallup International Association, and its European partners.</p>
        <p>In each country, we considered a sample of around 1,000 individuals aged 15 years and older (participants' age was ≥16 in England, ≥18 in Ireland, 15-64 in Greece, and 15-74 years in Latvia), representative of the general population in terms of age, sex, habitat (i.e., geographic area and/or size of municipality) and, in some countries, socio-economic characteristics. The survey included a total of 11,902 subjects. The whole population domain represented 79.2% of the whole EU population aged 15 years or over (432 million inhabitants).</p>
        <p>Sampling methods varied across countries: in Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Latvia and Romania, a multi-stage sampling was used and respondents were randomly chosen to be representative of the population in terms of sex, age, and geographic area (in Italy, representativeness by socio-economic characteristics was also ensured); in Germany, Ireland, Poland, Portugal and Spain, stratified random sampling was used, combining also Table 1 provides information on survey characteristics for each country, including fieldwork period, sample size, age range and sampling methods.</p>
        <p>Demographic characteristics included age (categorized as &lt;25, 25-44, 45-64, ≥65 years) and sex (men and women). Level of education was categorized as country-specific tertiles of schooling years. Self-assessment of household family economic status relative to the country-specific population was classified into three levels (higher than average, average and lower than average). Never smokers were defined as participants who had never smoked or had smoked less than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. Smokers were defined as participants who reported smoking at least 100 cigarettes (including hand-rolled cigarettes) during their lifetime. Current smokers were smokers who reported smoking at the time they participated in this survey, while ex-smokers were smokers who stopped smoking by the time they participated in this survey. 3,21 Smokers also provided information on age of starting smoking and the number of cigarettes smoked per day. For each country, we calculated the male-to-female smoking prevalence ratio as the current smoking prevalence in men divided by that in women. The 12 countries were classified into Northern (England, Ireland, Latvia), Western (France, Germany), Southern (Italy, Greece, Portugal, Spain), and Eastern (Bulgaria, Poland, Romania), following United Nation M49 standard, 22 and halved by their gross domestic product (GDP) per capita 23 into &lt;25.000€ (Latvia, Romania, Poland, Portugal, Greece, Bulgaria) and ≥25.000€ (England, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain).</p>
        <p>We obtained study approval from a local Ethics Committee in each of the 12 countries (Supplementary Table 1). Details on the survey characteristics were provided to all participants by suitably qualified professionals through a structured information sheet, and all the participants provided their consents by ticking the electronic field in the computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) questionnaire. The study protocol has been registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT02928536).</p>
        <p>The procedures for recruitment of subjects, data collection, storage and protection (based on anonymous identification code) are in accordance with the current country-specific legislation. This was ratified and signed by DOXA and each of its European partners.</p>
        <p>Statistical weights were used to generate representative estimates of the general population of each country (individual weight). To calculate results for the entire sample, we applied "country weights", which combined individual weights with an additional A c c e p t e d V e r s i o n weighting factor, with each country contributing in proportion to its population aged 15 years or over, obtained by Eurostat. 24 We considered descriptive statistics including relative frequency (%) and its corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for categorical variables, and mean and standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables.</p>
        <p>ORs and their corresponding 95% CIs were estimated using multilevel logistic randomeffects models, to take into account the heterogeneity between the 12 European countries.</p>
        <p>The study country effects were considered as random intercepts, and sex, age and level of education as adjusting variables. Country weights were used in all logistic regression models. Analyses were performed with

        <p>Among 11,902 participants, 57.6% (95% CI: 56.8-58.5%) described themselves as never smokers (49.5% in men and 65.1% in women), 16 Table 3 provides the ORs for current vs. non-smokers according to selected individuallevel and country-specific characteristics. Smoking prevalence was higher in men than in women (OR=1.67; 95% CI: 1.53-1.82). Compared with subjects aged &lt;45 years, ORs were 0.97 (95% CI: 0.89-1.07) for 45-64 years, and 0.31 (95% CI: 0.27-0.36) for ≥65</p>
        <p>A c c e p t e d V e r s i o n years. Compared with high level of education, the ORs were 1.39 (95% CI: 1.25-1.55) for medium and 1.32 (95% CI: 1.17-1.48) for low level of education (p for trend&lt;0.001).</p>
        <p>Compared to those with a high household economic status, the ORs were 1.33 (95% CI:</p>
        <p>1.15-1.54) and 2.05 (95% CI: 1.74-2.42) for those with an average and low economic status, respectively. The patterns observed for all the individual-level characteristics were consistent in men and women. Compared with Northern Europe, the ORs of smoking were 1.58 (95% CI: 0.98-2.56) in Western, 1.52 (95% CI: 0.93-2.49) in Southern and 1.57 (95% CI: 0.92-2.70) in Eastern European countries. Compared to Northern Europe, the OR in men was higher in Western Europe (OR=2.17; 95% CI: 1.35-3.48), Southern Europe (OR=1.77; 95% CI: 1.09-2.87) and Eastern Europe (OR=1.87; 95% CI: 1.10-3.18). Smoking prevalence showed no significant difference between countries with lower and higher GDP per capita, the ORs for less wealthy countries being 1.22 (95% CI: 0.82-1.81).</p>
        <p>Approximately one out of four adults is a current smoker in Europe, including one out of three men and one out of five women. Smoking prevalence showed large differences across European countries, being highest in Eastern Europe (i.e., 28%) and lowest in Northern Europe (i.e., 20%).</p>
        <p>In both men and women, smoking prevalence is highest among young adults aged 25-44 years. Almost all current smokers in Europe started smoking before aged 25 years.</p>
        <p>Therefore, this study confirms that teenagers and young adults are the most vulnerable group to start smoking, 3 and thus are the most important target population for tobacco control interventions aimed to decrease nicotine addiction initiation.</p>
        <p>Smoking prevalence among women, exceeding 15% in all the 12 countries, is in an advanced stage of the tobacco epidemic. 3,25 However, notable differences were observed in the male-to-female smoking prevalence ratio, ranging from 1.04 in England to 2.58 in Latvia. This suggests that some countries (likely those with a higher male-to-female smoking prevalence ratio) are in an earlier phase compared with others. 3,25 Multilevel logistic analyses indicate that the level of education was inversely related to smoking prevalence in both men and women. Analysing other individual level and A c c e p t e d V e r s i o n country specific indicators of SES, we also found that smoking prevalence was systematically higher in the sub-population with low SES. This finding was independent of sex, age and education, as reported in a few other investigations. 26 Our results are in broad agreement with current evidence, 27,28 and underline the need for specific measures specifically focused on low socio-economic groups to reduce health inequalities from tobacco.</p>
        <p>In general, our findings are consistent with those reported in the Global Health Observatory data repository of the WHO 29 and those found in the 2017 Eurobarometer survey. 8 The study shows a smoking prevalence for the EU of 26% overall, 30% in men and 20% in women, thus very similar to our estimates. In Italy, the smoking prevalence found in TackSHS survey (19% overall, 23% in men and 16% in women) appears slightly lower than that found in the 2016 national survey conducted on around 3000 subjects (i.e., 22% overall, 27% in men and 17% in women). 30 Some major discrepancies with current evidence from the scientific literature were noted particularly in Portugal, where we found a smoking prevalence greater than 30% for both men and women. Our estimates are in fact substantially higher than those reported before 2015 for daily smoking (lower than 20%). 2,31,32 The different definition of current smoking and the different sampling methodology used are not sufficient to explain the substantial gap found in smoking prevalence. Moreover, the distribution of our Portuguese sample by sex and age group is very similar to the official distribution provided by Eurostat. 24 Other adult smoking prevalence estimates for Portugal, including those from the 2010 PPACTE study (i.e., 32% overall, 36% in men and 29% in women), 3 or the 2015 WHO estimates (i.e., 32% in men and 14% in women), 29 or the 2017 Eurobarometer survey (i.e., 26% overall) 8 are more similar -but still substantially lower -than our estimates.</p>
        <p>Overall the smoking prevalence remained almost the same (from 27.2% to 26.4%) in the 11 countries that were included in both the TackSHS and PPACTE (2010) surveys, using similar methodologies and definitions. But for France, Portugal, Romania, and Spain, we observed increases in smoking prevalence over the last decade but a decrease from 36% to 20% in Ireland.</p>
        <p>The trends in smoking prevalence found in our data match those from the Eurobarometer surveys: the comparison between the 2017 8 and 2009 11 surveys indicated a decrease in smoking prevalence for all countries except for France and Portugal.</p>
        <p>Smoking prevalence estimates in Europe remain substantially higher as compared to those from other high-income countries, such as the USA, Canada, and Australia, where less than 15% of adults are current smokers. 2,33 The limitations of the present study include some differences of sampling in the study countries. Notwithstanding, all samples selected were representative of their population in terms of age, sex and geographic area and/or size of municipality. The age range of the participants was slightly different in some countries. In particular, in Greece the sample was limited to subjects aged 15-64 years, thus likely providing an over-estimation of the adult smoking prevalence. However, even assuming that the smoking prevalence in the elderly (representing in Greece 25% of the adult population 24 ) was 50% that in younger adults -as observed in the other 11 countries -we would estimate a smoking prevalence around 30%, still similar to the provided estimate.</p>
        <p>The strengths of our survey include the representativeness of the adult population of the 12 selected European countries, the use of the same questionnaire in the 12 countries sampled, developed by a group of experts on tobacco control, the standardized use of a single definition of current smokers, and the use of face-to-face interviews.</p>
        <p>Our data indicate that there are 112 million current smokers in EU, including 65 million men and 47 million women. We confirm that the large majority of smokers started smoking when they were adolescents, and that lower SES is a major determinant of smoking habit in Europe. Tobacco control measures to decrease smoking initiation and to promote smoking cessation should therefore be targeted at young people and the subgroup with lower SES, respectively. Increasing tobacco prices, through the adoption of additional excise taxes, has been shown to be more effective among younger generations and in economically deprived populations. 28,34 Therefore, price increase is still likely to be a particularly effective tobacco control strategy, particularly in those European countries where tobacco price is still relatively low and resources for tobacco control are scarce. 35 A c c e p t e d V e r s i o n</p>
