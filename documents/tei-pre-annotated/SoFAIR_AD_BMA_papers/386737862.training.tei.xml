        <p>We build an empirical model to attribute delays in mortgage re…nancing to psychological re…nancing costs that inhibit re…nancing until incentives are strong enough; and to behavior-potentially attributable to information-gathering costs-that lowers the probability that a household re…nances in a given period at any incentive. We estimate the model on high-quality administrative panel data from Denmark, where mortgage re…nancing without cash-out is unconstrained. Middle-aged and wealthy households act as if they have high psychological re…nancing costs; but older, poorer, and less educated households re…nance with lower probability irrespective of incentives, and thereby achieve lower savings. We use the model to understand frictions in the mortgage channel of monetary policy transmission.We build an empirical model to attribute delays in mortgage re…nancing to psychological re…nancing costs that inhibit re…nancing until incentives are strong enough; and to behavior-potentially attributable to information-gathering costs-that lowers the probability that a household re…nances in a given period at any incentive.

        <p>A pervasive …nding in studies of household …nancial decision-making is that households respond slowly to changing …nancial incentives. Inaction is common, even in circumstances where market conditions are changing continuously, and actions often occur long after the incentive to take them has …rst arisen. Well known examples include participation, saving, and asset allocation decisions in retirement savings plans, and portfolio rebalancing in response to ‡uctuations in risky asset prices. 2In this paper we study mortgage re…nancing-a particularly important decision given the size of mortgages relative to household budgets-with a view towards shedding light on the underlying structural determinants of inaction. We do so in Denmark, an environment uniquely suited to analyzing these questions, using a large panel of high-quality administrative data. One standard explanation for inaction is that there are …xed costs of taking action, so that households do so only when the bene…ts are su¢ ciently large. (S; s) models of optimal inaction in the presence of …xed costs have been a staple of the economics literature since the 1950s. They have been used to model many di¤erent decisions, including those by …rms to change their prices (Caplin and Spulber 1987, Caballero and Engel 1991, Caplin and Leahy 1991) and decisions by households to switch health insurance plans (Handel 2013). These models are sometimes called "state-dependent,"because …nancial incentives determine whether or not an action is taken.A pervasive …nding in studies of household …nancial decision-making is that households respond slowly to changing …nancial incentives.

        <p>In the case of mortgage re…nancing, monetary …xed costs justify an inaction range until the interest rate saving reaches an optimal threshold that triggers re…nancing. Inaction beyond this point can be explained by psychological costs of re…nancing that shift the threshold, widening the inaction range. These psychological costs could re ‡ect the value of time spent executing a re…nancing, possibly augmented by behavioral present bias that makes households reluctant to incur current time costs for the sake of future bene…ts (Laibson 1997, O'Donoghue andRabin 1999).In the case of mortgage re…nancing, monetary …xed costs justify an inaction range until the interest rate saving reaches an optimal threshold that triggers re…nancing.

        <p>As an initial step to evaluate this state-dependent approach, we calculate an optimal re…nancing threshold for each household-quarter in our data, using a model recently proposed by Agarwal, Driscoll, and Laibson (ADL 2013) that includes monetary but no psychological re…nancing costs.As an initial step to evaluate this state-dependent approach, we calculate an optimal re…nancing threshold for each household-quarter in our data, using a model recently proposed by Agarwal, Driscoll, and Laibson (ADL 2013) that includes monetary but no psychological re…nancing costs.</p>
        <p>We show that households commonly fail to re…nance despite having potential interest rate savings greater than the ADL threshold. This …nding of pervasive slow re…nancing is consistent with results reported by Agarwal, Rosen, and Yao (2016) and Keys, Pope, and Pope (2016) in US data. 3Is this evidence consistent with a state-dependent model that also allows for …xed unobserved psychological re…nancing costs? In a static setting where each household is observed only once, unobserved re…nancing costs can explain any pattern of re…nancing behavior. Since re…nancing depends on the distribution of thresholds, this distribution can be backed out directly from the data, but the model implies no further restrictions. In a dynamic setting where households are observed repeatedly, however, a state-dependent model of inaction with …xed, unobserved re…nancing costs does restrict behavior. This model predicts that no household will ever re…nance for the …rst time at an incentive (an interest saving relative to its household-speci…c threshold) that is lower than one it faced at an earlier period; and after a …rst-time re…nancing, a household will never re…nance at a di¤erent incentive, or fail to re…nance at a higher incentive, than the one that triggered the initial re…nancing. These restrictions are far from satis…ed by household behavior in our panel data.We show that households commonly fail to re…nance despite having potential interest rate savings greater than the ADL threshold.

        <p>To relax these restrictions, one needs a model in which household behavior varies over time. One possibility is that observable factors change the cost of re…nancing, and hence shift the threshold, as in Handel (2013). 4 However, most of the household characteristics that we observe in the data are either …xed or evolve smoothly over time; and we …nd that the exceptions (life events such as getting married or having children) have relatively minor e¤ects on re…nancing behavior.To relax these restrictions, one needs a model in which household behavior varies over time.

        <p>A second possibility is that unobserved shocks move the costs of taking action, as in Nakamura and Steinsson's (2010) model of …rms'price-setting. Standard discrete-choice models, such as the logit and probit models, specify that an action is taken if a random shock is large enough that a linear combination of household characteristics plus the shock exceeds a …xed threshold. If a new shock is drawn for each household in each period, then the re…nancing decisions of a given household need not be tightly related across di¤erent periods. Models of this sort can be extremely ‡exible if the distribution of shocks is allowed to vary across households and over time; but for this very reason, they can sometimes be di¢ cult to interpret in terms of a plausible economic model of household behavior.A second possibility is that unobserved shocks move the costs of taking action, as in Nakamura and Steinsson's (2010) model of …rms'price-setting.

        <p>A third possibility is that households pay a …xed cost not only to re…nance a mortgage, but also to gather information, and to evaluate the costs and bene…ts of re…nancing. 5 Models with …xed information-gathering costs generically imply that agents gather information only intermittently, when the bene…ts of doing so exceed these costs. Agents in these models will take action only in periods in which they have gathered information and evaluated the net bene…t, even if the incentives to take action are stronger in other periods. Such models have been applied to …rms'price-setting behavior by Alvarez, Lippi, and Paciello (2011) and Stevens (2020) among others, and to household behavior by Du¢ e and Sun (1990), Gabaix and Laibson (2002), Reis (2006a,b), and Abel, Eberly, andPanageas (2007, 2013) among others.A third possibility is that households pay a …xed cost not only to re…nance a mortgage, but also to gather information, and to evaluate the costs and bene…ts of re…nancing. 5 Models with …xed information-gathering costs generically imply that agents gather information only intermittently, when the bene…ts of doing so exceed these costs.

        <p>When information-gathering is observable, it is possible to structurally estimate models with costs of both gathering information and taking action (Alvarez, Guiso, andLippi 2012, Stevens 2020). Information-gathering at the household level is not often observable, however, and in our context, we only observe the household re…nancing outcome. 6 Accordingly, we take a more reducedform approach. We begin with a state-dependent model of …xed re…nancing costs. The baseline version of this model assumes that the psychological re…nancing cost is the same for all households with the same observable demographic characteristics, but in an extension of the model we allow for unobserved time-invariant heterogeneity in psychological re…nancing costs. To this model we add a probability less than one of considering a re…nancing in any period, as in Calvo (1983). To relax some of the restrictions implied by a strict Calvo-style model of "time-dependent" inaction, we allow this probability to vary both with observable household characteristics and with time …xed e¤ects, capturing cross-sectional and time-series determinants of the cost and perceived bene…t of gathering mortgage market information. Finally, we allow random shocks to a¤ect household choice in each period, but we assume that these shocks have a constant distribution across households and over time.When information-gathering is observable, it is possible to structurally estimate models with costs of both gathering information and taking action (Alvarez, Guiso, andLippi 2012, Stevens 2020).

        <p>Our parameterization of time-varying behavior is not the only possible one; as discussed above, we could, for example, have modeled heterogeneous time-variation in the re…nancing threshold.Our parameterization of time-varying behavior is not the only possible one; as discussed above, we could, for example, have modeled heterogeneous time-variation in the re…nancing threshold.</p>
        <p>That said, the model we estimate has both good explanatory power in-sample and good predictive power out-of-sample in subsets of our data, and the time-varying component is important for this performance.

        <p>In our panel data a household that monitors mortgage markets continuously but has a high psychological re…nancing cost will rarely re…nance at a low incentive, but will reliably do so when the incentive exceeds its threshold.

        <p>Estimating the model on the Danish data, we document how demographic characteristics a¤ect both psychological re…nancing costs and our parameters that capture time-varying behavior. We …nd that psychological re…nancing costs are hump-shaped in age and generally increasing in measures of socioeconomic status, with a particularly large e¤ect on …nancially wealthy households. This pattern is consistent with the idea that such costs re ‡ect, at least in part, the unmeasured value of time spent on mortgage re…nancing. By contrast, older households with lower education, income, housing wealth, and …nancial wealth are well described by a Calvo-style model with a low re…nancing probability.

        <p>In addition to providing insights into the sources of inaction in household …nance, our work has implications for the transmission of monetary policy through the mortgage re…nancing channel. Consider for example a one-time decline in interest rates to a lower level that then remains unchanged. In a model where many households have a low probability of considering a re…nancing in any period, the interest rate decline has delayed e¤ects on re…nancing because some households react only with a lag. In contrast, in a model with pure state-dependent inaction, the interest rate decline generates an instantaneous re…nancing wave by the subset of households whose re…nancing incentives move above the higher threshold de…ned by their psychological re…nancing costs. However there is no further re…nancing predicted by the pure state-dependent model after the initial period. We show how these predictions play out in the Danish data using a series of counterfactual, partial equilibrium simulations from our model.In addition to providing insights into the sources of inaction in household …nance, our work has implications for the transmission of monetary policy through the mortgage re…nancing channel.

        <p>A note on the data is in order. Our empirical work analyzes a comprehensive administrative dataset on re…nancing decisions in Denmark between 2009 and 2017. The Danish mortgage system is ideal for our purpose because, while it is similar to the US system in that long-term …xed-rate mortgages are common and can be re…nanced without penalties related to the level of interest rates, it di¤ers in two ways that facilitate our analysis.A note on the data is in order.

        <p>First, Danish households are free to re…nance their mortgages whenever they choose to do so, even if their home equity is negative or their credit standing has deteriorated, provided that they do not "cash out"by extracting home equity. Danish borrowers can add the …xed costs of re…nancing to their mortgage balance without triggering the cash-out restriction, so re…nancing does not require liquid …nancial assets and is not a¤ected by borrowing constraints. In the US mortgage system, by contrast, households are constrained from re…nancing when they have negative home equity or impaired credit scores, and it is di¢ cult to accurately measure these constraints. These features of the Danish mortgage system allow us to study household re…nancing behavior without having to control for the additional constraints that restrict re…nancing in the US.First, Danish households are free to re…nance their mortgages whenever they choose to do so, even if their home equity is negative or their credit standing has deteriorated, provided that they do not "cash out"by extracting home equity.

        <p>Second, the Danish statistical o¢ ce provides us with accurate administrative data on household demographic and …nancial characteristics at each point in time, for all mortgage borrowers including both re…nancers and non-re…nancers. This allows us to measure the prevalence of time-and statedependent slow re…nancing across demographic groups. This again stands in contrast with the US system, where it is challenging to measure borrower characteristics continuously. These are reported only at the time of a mortgage application in the US, through the form required by the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), and hence one cannot directly compare the characteristics of re…nancers and non-re…nancers at a point in time using these data.Second, the Danish statistical o¢ ce provides us with accurate administrative data on household demographic and …nancial characteristics at each point in time, for all mortgage borrowers including both re…nancers and non-re…nancers.

        <p>Almost all previous research on mortgage re…nancing has studied US data. Slow mortgage prepayment and risk created by random time-variation in prepayment rates were the main preoccupations of a large literature on the pricing and hedging of US mortgage-backed securities in the years before the global …nancial crisis of the late 2000s. 7 Since the …nancial crisis, there has been interest in the extent to which slow re…nancing-caused either by household inaction or by barriers to re…nancing-has reduced the e¤ectiveness of expansionary US monetary policy (Agarwal et al. 2015, Auclert 2019, Beraja et al. 2019, Di Maggio et al. 2017). Two exceptions to the US focus of the re…nancing literature are Miles (2004) and Bajo and Barbi (2016), which study the UK and Italy respectively.

        <p>Within the US re…nancing literature, many papers have tried to overcome the limited data available on re…nancing constraints and the characteristics of non-re…nancing households. Agarwal, Rosen, and Yao (2016) and Keys, Pope, and Pope (2016) use a number of ingenious techniques to handle these problems, combining available data to impute household variables that they cannot observe such as current creditworthiness and demographic characteristics. Keys, Pope, and Pope (2016) and Johnson, Meier, and Toubia (2015) also study pre-approved re…nancing o¤ers that eliminate re…nancing constraints, but these are relatively infrequent and thus samples are small. 8 In the aftermath of the global …nancial crisis, the US government tried to relax re…nancing constraints through the Home A¤ordable Re…nance Program (HARP), but the e¤ectiveness of this program remains an outstanding research question (Agarwal et al. 2015, Tracy and Wright 2012, Zandi and deRitis 2011, Zhu 2012).Within the US re…nancing literature, many papers have tried to overcome the limited data available on re…nancing constraints and the characteristics of non-re…nancing households.

        <p>Our work is also related to a broader literature on the di¢ culties households have in managing their mortgage borrowing. Campbell andCocco (2003, 2015) specify models of optimal choice between FRMs and ARMs, and optimal prepayment and default decisions, showing how challenging it is to make these decisions correctly. Chen, Michaux, and Roussanov (2020) similarly study decisions to extract home equity through cash-out re…nancing, while Khandani, Lo, and Merton (2013) and Bhutta and Keys (2016) argue that households used cash-out re…nancing to borrow too aggressively during the housing boom of the early 2000s.

        <p>Finally, as already discussed our paper relates to a large literature on the price-setting decisions of …rms.

        <p>The Danish mortgage system is similar to the US system in o¤ering long-term …xed-rate mortgages without prepayment penalties, but it has a number of design features that di¤er from the US model (Campbell 2013, Gyntelberg et al. 2012, Lea 2011).

        <p>Danish mortgages, like those in some other continental European countries, are funded using covered bonds: obligations of mortgage lenders that are collateralized by pools of mortgages. These bonds are currently issued by seven mortgage banks, who operate in a highly competitive market and charge very similar mortgage rates and administration fees. While mortgages on various types of property are eligible as collateral for mortgage bonds, mortgages on residential property dominate most collateral pools. Danish mortgage banks act as intermediaries between investors and borrowers. Investors buy mortgage bonds which are issued by the mortgage banks and backed by a pool of mortgages, while borrowers take out mortgages from the banks. All lending is secured, and once banks initially screen borrowers, they have no further in ‡uence on mortgage rates, which are entirely determined by the market. Borrowers pay the coupons on the mortgage bonds, as well as a fee to the mortgage bank to compensate for administrative costs and the bank's credit exposure. This fee is roughly 70 basis points on average, and depends on the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio on the mortgage, but is otherwise independent of household characteristics. Borrowers'retail banks work with the mortgage banks to arrange mortgage issuance and settle monthly payments.Danish mortgages, like those in some other continental European countries, are funded using covered bonds: obligations of mortgage lenders that are collateralized by pools of mortgages.

        <p>Under this system mortgage payments, including prepayments, ‡ow directly to covered bond investors. As a result, prepayments do not a¤ect the cash ‡ows received by mortgage banks, except through their e¤ect on fee receipts on account of contract termination. If a borrower defaults, however, the mortgage bank must replace the defaulted mortgage in the pool that backs the mortgage bond. This ensures that investors are una¤ected by defaults in their borrower pool so long as the bank remains solvent. In e¤ect, bond investors bear interest rate and prepayment risk, while mortgage banks retain credit risk.9 Traditionally the Danish system has been dominated by …xed-rate mortgages, although adjustablerate mortgages have become more popular in the last 15 years. Badarinza, Campbell, and Ramadorai (2018) report that the average share of adjustable-rate mortgages in Denmark was 45% in the period 2003-13, with a standard deviation of 13%. At the beginning of our sample period in 2009, the adjustable-rate mortgage share was roughly 40%.Under this system mortgage payments, including prepayments, ‡ow directly to covered bond investors.

        <p>Fixed-rate mortgage borrowers in Denmark have the right to prepay their mortgages without incurring penalties.

        <p>An important feature is that the Danish mortgage system imposes minimal barriers to any re…nancing that does not "cash out"(in a sense to be made more precise below). Danish borrowers can re…nance their mortgages to reduce their interest rate and/or extend their loan maturity, without cashing out, even if their homes have declined in value (i.e., even when they have negative home equity). Related to this, re…nancing without cashing out does not require a review of the borrower's credit quality. 10 Moreover, re…nancing costs do not need to be paid up front, but can be added to mortgage principal as part of a re…nancing, without being counted as a cash-out. These features of the system imply that all mortgage borrowers, including those whose credit quality has deteriorated, can bene…t from a decline in interest rates, even in a weak economy with declining house prices and consumer deleveraging.An important feature is that the Danish mortgage system imposes minimal barriers to any re…nancing that does not "cash out"(in a sense to be made more precise below).

        <p>Mortgage banks have incentives to re…nance mortgages in this way because, as previously mentioned, they do not receive mortgage cash ‡ows but do bear credit risk; and re…nancing to take advantage of lower interest rates reduces the risk of default by lowering mortgage payments and relieving household budgets. Retail banks, similarly, have incentives to advise their customers to re…nance because they earn fees for arranging the transaction. This structure reduces re…nancing frictions that have been identi…ed in the US market arising from imperfect competition in mortgage origination (Agarwal et al. 2015).Mortgage banks have incentives to re…nance mortgages in this way because, as previously mentioned, they do not receive mortgage cash ‡ows but do bear credit risk; and re…nancing to take advantage of lower interest rates reduces the risk of default by lowering mortgage payments and relieving household budgets.

        <p>The mechanics of re…nancing in Denmark are as follows. A mortgage bank, working on behalf of a borrower, repurchases mortgage bonds corresponding to the mortgage debt, and delivers them 10 Denmark does not have a system of continuous credit scores like the widely used FICO scores in the US. Instead, there is what amounts to a zero/one scoring system that can be used to label an individual as a delinquent borrower ("dårlig betaler") who has unpaid debt outstanding. A delinquent borrower would be unlikely to obtain a mortgage, but a borrower with an existing mortgage can re…nance, without cashing out, even if he or she has been labeled as delinquent since the mortgage was taken out.The mechanics of re…nancing in Denmark are as follows.

        <p>to the mortgage lender. This repurchase can be done either at market value or at face value. It is advantageous to repurchase bonds at market value if interest rates have risen since mortgage origination, but in an environment of declining interest rates such as the one we study, it is cheaper to repurchase bonds at face value as in a US re…nancing. 11 An important point is that mortgage bonds in Denmark are issued with discrete coupon rates, historically at integer levels and more recently at 50-basis point intervals. Market yields, of course, ‡uctuate continuously. Danish mortgage bonds can never be issued at a premium to face value, since this would allow instantaneous advantageous re…nancing, and normally are issued at a discount to face value; in other words, the market yield is somewhat above the discrete coupon at issue. This implies that to raise, say, DKK 1 million for a mortgage, bonds must be issued with a face value which is higher than DKK 1 million. Re…nancing the mortgage in an environment of falling rates requires buying the full face value of the bonds that were originally issued to …nance it. Therefore the interest saving from re…nancing in the Danish system is given by the spread between the coupon rate on the old mortgage bond (not the yield on the mortgage when it was issued) and the yield on a new mortgage.to the mortgage lender.

        <p>Similarly, re…nancing increases mortgage principal because new bonds must be issued at a discount to repurchase the old ones. However, such a transaction does not count as a cash-out re…nancing provided that the market value of the newly issued mortgage bonds is no greater than the face value of the old mortgage bonds plus any re…nancing costs that have been borrowed as part of the re…nancing.Similarly, re…nancing increases mortgage principal because new bonds must be issued at a discount to repurchase the old ones.

        <p>Importantly, this increase in mortgage principal has a much smaller impact on Danish borrowers than it would do in the US mortgage system. Danish borrowers have the option to pay o¤ their mortgage at market value or face value (an option that survives even in the event of default); and at mortgage origination market value is below face value, so market value is the relevant measure of 11 In a rising interest-rate environment, the option to repurchase bonds at market value is a valuable feature of the Danish mortgage system. It prevents "lock-in" by allowing homeowners who move to buy out their old mortgages at a discounted market value rather than prepaying at face value as is required in the US system. It also allows homeowners to take advantage of disruptions in the mortgage bond market by e¤ectively buying back their own debt if a mortgage-bond …re sale occurs. the burden of the debt. The higher face value becomes relevant only in the event that interest rates decline far enough for borrowers to consider a second re…nancing.

        <p>To operationalize our analysis of re…nancing, we begin by identifying households with a single …xed-rate mortgage. This is done in four steps, year-by-year.

Second, to simplify the analysis of re…nancing choice, we focus on households with a single mortgage observed in two consecutive years, leaving us with 641,786 households in the 2009-2010 consecutive year period.

The ADL model assumes that mortgages have an in…nite maturity with principal declining at an exogenous constant rate, that mortgages may be re…nanced multiple times, that mortgage borrowers are risk-neutral with respect to re…nancing proceeds, and that the mortgage interest rate follows an arithmetic random walk. The last assumption approximates the behavior of the long-term interest rate in standard term structure models, because substantial predictability in long-term interest rate changes would imply highly pro…table trading strategies in long-term bonds which are ruled out by such models.</p>

        <p>The …gure shows that the ADL threshold is a concave function of …xed costs, but becomes roughly linear at high levels of …xed costs. The level and slope of the function are considerably greater for smaller mortgages, and slightly greater for older mortgages with shorter remaining time to maturity, because …xed costs are more important relative to interest savings for these mortgages. This implies that for any given mortgage, the threshold rises over time as principal is paid down and remaining maturity declines; hence, the incentive to re…nance declines over time if the interest rate remains unchanged. This e¤ect is small for new mortgages (and for most of the mortgages in our sample), but it becomes increasingly important as mortgages age.

        <p>We note two minor limitations of the ADL formula in our context. First, it gives us the incentive for a household to re…nance from a …xed-rate mortgage to another …xed-rate mortgage.

        <p>Second, the ADL formula ignores the fact, unique to the Danish system, that re…nancing may increase the mortgage principal balance because the coupon on the new mortgage bond is lower than the market yield. Because Danish households have the option to pay o¤ a mortgage at market value, which is below face value immediately after a re…nancing, this increase in the mortgage principal has no economic e¤ect except in the event that interest rates decline in the future to the point where the household considers re…nancing the new mortgage. The value of the re…nancing option attached to the new mortgage is determined by the new mortgage bond coupon, and is lower than that assumed by the ADL formula whenever that coupon is lower than the current market yield, in other words, whenever the mortgage principal increases. In section 4.5, we bound the magnitude of this e¤ect by comparing the ADL model with an alternative model due to Chen and Ling (1989) that excludes subsequent re…nancings entirely.Second, the ADL formula ignores the fact, unique to the Danish system, that re…nancing may increase the mortgage principal balance because the coupon on the new mortgage bond is lower than the market yield.

        <p>Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of Danish …xed-rate mortgages, and households' propensity to re…nance them. As mentioned earlier, we have over 9.3 million quarterly observations of household mortgages. The average mortgage has an outstanding principal of DKK 983,000 (about $147,000), just over 23 years to maturity, and a loan-to-value ratio of 60%. These characteristics are fairly stable over our sample period, although principal and loan-to-value ratios do increase somewhat in later years.Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of Danish …xed-rate mortgages, and households' propensity to re…nance them.

        <p>The evidence reported so far could be consistent with a pure state-dependent model in which households have heterogeneous unobserved re…nancing thresholds. If we had a single cross-section of mortgage re…nancing, we could never reject such a model. The observed re…nancing rate by ADL incentive in the top panel of Figure 2 would tell us the fraction of households at each ADL incentive level that have a positive incentive relative to their own unobserved threshold, but the model would not place any restrictions on the data. Because we observe households over time, we can use the dynamics of re…nancing to show that a pure state-dependent model is inadequate to explain Danish household behavior.

This di¤erence is frequently negative (35% of observations), implying that households could have got better rates by re…nancing earlier. This …nding is particularly striking since the downward trend in interest rates during our sample period implies that increases in re…nancing incentives are more common than declines.First, a household that re…nances should never do so at an ADL incentive that is lower than the highest incentive it has previously experienced.

        <p>We now turn to a more detailed analysis of the mapping between Danish households'demographic characteristics, their probability of considering a re…nancing, and their psychological re…nancing costs. Table 3 reports estimates of all the demographic e¤ects in our baseline model.

Financial literacy of the household or the family has this e¤ect, consistent with recent work highlighting the bene…cial impacts of …nancial education on a range of household …nance decisions (see, e.g., Haliassos, Jansson, and Karabulut 2020), as do life events such as getting married or having children. 24 On the other hand, there are also characteristics that move people closer to the rational benchmark in one dimension but further away in the other. For example, married couples are more likely to be awake but have higher psychological re…nancing costs than unmarried couples, while immigrants have the opposite pattern.We now turn to a more detailed analysis of the mapping between Danish households'demographic characteristics, their probability of considering a re…nancing, and their psychological re…nancing costs.

This is closely related to the measure of re…nancing e¢ ciency illustrated in Figure 3, although for simplicity we do not calculate interest savings. These re…nancing e¢ ciency measures can be calculated at any period of the simulation, and Online Appendix Figure B12 reports results two years after the initial interest rate decline. Among households grouped by age, state-dependent inaction lowers the re…nancing e¢ ciency of middle-aged households relative to younger and older households, while time-dependent inaction lowers the re…nancing e¢ -of older households. In our full model the e¤ect of time-dependent inaction dominates, just as we saw in the data in Figure 5. Among households grouped by income, state-dependent inaction lowers the re…nancing e¢ ciency of higher-income households, while time-dependent inaction lowers the re…nancing e¢ ciency of poorer households. Again, time-dependent inaction dominates in both the simulation and the data.</p>
        <p>In Figure 10 we consider three modi…cations of the Danish mortgage system designed speci…cally to improve the re…nancing e¢ ciency of older and poorer households. These are compared with our baseline model of the current Danish mortgage system and with fully rational re…nancing at the ADL threshold. The …rst modi…cation (labeled R) rebates the …xed component of the mortgage re…nancing fee (DKK 3; 000) and removes the caps on the fees to make the mortgage re…nancing fee proportional. This eliminates the tendency of smaller mortgages (which are disproportionately held by older and poorer households) to have higher ADL thresholds. The second modi…cation advertises re…nancing opportunities (lowers information-gathering costs) in such a way that onehalf of all households who were asleep are woken up. The third modi…cation combines these two policies.In Figure 10 we consider three modi…cations of the Danish mortgage system designed speci…cally to improve the re…nancing e¢ ciency of older and poorer households.

        <p>The top panel of Figure 10 shows that waking households up is a much more powerful way to increase aggregate re…nancing rates. This may not be surprising given the large size of the interest rate reduction we are considering, which is su¢ cient to give 90% of households an incentive to re…nance relative to the ADL threshold.

        <p>In this paper we document and empirically model the sources of households'slow mortgage re…nancing behavior. We do so in Denmark, a context that is particularly advantageous for studying this type of household behavior because the Danish mortgage system places no restrictions on re…nancing that does not involve cash-out. In this unique setting, households that neglect opportunities to substantially reduce their mortgage costs are not constrained, and are leaving money on the table . This provides an opportunity to acquire insights into the underlying sources of household inaction, especially since the Danish statistical system allows us to measure the demographic and economic characteristics of households in great detail.In this paper we document and empirically model the sources of households'slow mortgage re…nancing behavior.

        <p>One might be concerned that these patterns are sensitive to the ADL formula we have used as our rational benchmark for re…nancing. To address this concern, we have shown that Danish households who re…nance promptly (in the …rst few percent of households whose old mortgages carry the same interest rate) do so at interest savings similar to the ADL threshold. We have also recomputed all thresholds using an alternative model of optimal re…nancing due to Chen and Ling (1989), and obtain similar results. Our conclusion is that while di¤erent assumptions can have noticeable e¤ects on optimal re…nancing thresholds, they cannot make a large enough di¤erence to account for the slow re…nancing rates observed in the Danish data or to substantially alter the cross-sectional patterns in time-and state-dependent re…nancing that we document.One might be concerned that these patterns are sensitive to the ADL formula we have used as our rational benchmark for re…nancing.

        <p>These statistics are calculated using all unique mortgages taken by households in Denmark with an unchanging number of adult members, and with a single fixed rate mortgage. In Panel A, the rows show, in order, the total number of household-quarter observations in the data; the average principal remaining (outstanding) on these mortgages in millions of Danish Kroner (DKK); the average number of years remaining before mortgages mature; the average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio on these mortgages; the fraction refinancing in a quarter (i.e., the fraction of households that refinanced their pre-existing mortgage voluntarily rather than refinancing for exogenous reasons such as moving house); the fraction refinancing from a fixed rate mortgage (FRM) to another FRM; the fraction of all mortgages with negative refinancing incentives calculated using Agarwal et al. ( 2013) formula (ADL); the fraction of mortgages with negative ADL incentives which refinance; the fraction of mortgages with positive refinancing incentives computed using the ADL formula; and the fraction with positive ADL incentives which refinance. In Panel B, the rows document the fractions of households refinancing either once or multiple times during the sample period. The columns document the fractions of these households refinancing at incentives which are either greater than, or less than or equal to, incentive levels previously experienced over the sample period. We estimate this specification using all households in Denmark with an unchanging number of household members, with a single fixed rate mortgage in the beginning of each year from 2010-2017. The dependent variable takes the value of 1 for a refinancing in a given quarter, and 0 otherwise. Each column lists the parameters of our model of refinancing: χ is the probability that a household is asleep and does not respond to refinancing incentives, and the rows show its dependence on the listed demographic characteristics. φ captures the level of psychological refinancing costs (i.e., costs = exp(φ)) once again as a function of demographic characteristics, and exp(β), which does not depend on demographics, captures the responsiveness to the incentives. The coefficients include non-linear transformations, f(x), of all the ranked control variables in addition to their levels, where f(x) = √2𝑥 . Pseudo R 2 is calculated using the formula R 2 = 1-L1/L0, where L1 is the log likelihood from the given model and L0 is the log likelihood from a model which only allows for a constant probability of being asleep. *** , ** , and * indicate coefficients that are significant at the one, five, and ten percent level, respectively, using standard errors clustered at the level of households. This figure plots the ADL threshold level in basis points associated with each fixed cost in DKK on the x-axis. The solid line in the plot shows this mapping when the ADL threshold is computed using the mean estimated mortgage termination probability, the mean remaining mortgage principal, the mean remaining horizon on the mortgage, the mean interest rate on the mortgage, and the mean inflation rate. The two dashed lines in the plot show this mapping for (i) a smaller mortgage that is half the mean principal, and (ii) a shorter duration mortgage with half the mean remaining horizon to maturity.These statistics are calculated using all unique mortgages taken by households in Denmark with an unchanging number of adult members, and with a single fixed rate mortgage.

        <p>57 This figure illustrates the history of refinancing activity in the sample of Danish fixed-rate mortgages. In the top plot, the bars represent the number of refinancing households in each quarter. The bars are shaded according to the coupon rate on the old mortgage from which households refinance. In the bottom plot, we show the evolution of the quarterly Danish mortgage interest rate as it moves through the average refinancing threshold for mortgages with a specific coupon rate. For example, the very top lightest shaded horizontal line in the bottom plot shows the average interest rate refinancing threshold for the group of mortgages that bear coupon rates of 6%, i.e., the point at which the current interest rate needs to be, on average, to optimally justify refinancing for this group of mortgage holders. The thresholds for mortgages with coupons of 6%, 5%, 4%, 3.5%, 3%, and 2.5% are 5.06%, 4.22%, 3.27%, 2.83%, 2.28%, and 1.83% respectively. This figure illustrates refinancing activity to check whether households have idiosyncratic thresholds at which they always refinance. The top plot shows the histogram of the difference between computed incentives at the point at which households refinance and the best ever incentive experienced over the sample period prior to the point of refinancing; the second plot focuses on households that refinance at least twice, and plots the histogram across these households of the difference between the incentives at the two refinancing points; and the third plot shows the Kaplan-Meier "survival" (i.e., non-refinancing) estimate, i.e., plotting the number of quarters at which the household has incentives above those which they previously refinanced at but do not subsequently refinance, accounting for data censoring. This figure shows the model implied probability of households being subject to time-dependent inaction, estimated using the model in Table 3. The top panel shows a histogram of the distribution of the estimated time-dependent inaction probability across households, computed using a representative quarter, i.e., inputting the average mortgage age effect and average current quarter time effect estimated in the data. The bottom panel shows a box plot of the model implied estimated time-dependent inaction probability for each quarter of our data, i.e., inputting the time effect and mortgage age effect for each quarter listed on the vertical axis.57 This figure illustrates the history of refinancing activity in the sample of Danish fixed-rate mortgages.

        <p>Online Appendix TableB1reports the estimated coe¢ cients, and FigureB1shows a histogram of the estimated mortgage termination probabilities, with a dashed line showing the position of the ADL suggested "hardwired"level of 10% per annum. The mean of our estimated termination probabilities is 11.4%, larger than the median of 8.1% because the distribution of termination probabilities is right-skewed. The standard deviation of this distribution is 10.1%.Online Appendix TableB1reports the estimated coe¢ cients, and FigureB1shows a histogram of the estimated mortgage termination probabilities, with a dashed line showing the position of the ADL suggested "hardwired"level of 10% per annum.

        <p>That is, in each quarter, for mortgages with 10 or fewer years to maturity, we use the average 10 year mortgage bond yield to compute incentives, and for remaining tenures between 10-20 years (greater than 20 years) we use the average 20 year (30 year) bond yield. These 10, 20, and 30 year yields are calculated as value-weighted averages of yields on all newly issued mortgage bonds with maturities of 10, 20, and 30 years, respectively.That is, in each quarter, for mortgages with 10 or fewer years to maturity, we use the average 10 year mortgage bond yield to compute incentives, and for remaining tenures between 10-20 years (greater than 20 years) we use the average 20 year (30 year) bond yield.

        <p>The ADL and CL models are similar in one important respect: they both assume that mortgage borrowers are risk-neutral with respect to re…nancing proceeds.

Risk aversion would likely reduce the re…nancing threshold (since re…nancing today locks in an interest saving as opposed to waiting for a potentially larger but risky saving tomorrow), which would increase our estimates of psychological re…nancing costs.

        <p>We estimate our random coefficient specification using all households in Denmark with an unchanging number of household members, with a single fixed rate mortgage in the beginning of each year from 2010-2017. The dependent variable takes the value of 1 if there is refinancing in a given quarter, and 0 otherwise. Each column lists the parameters of our model of refinancing: χ is the probability that a household is asleep and does not respond to refinancing incentives (i.e., probability = exp(χ)/(1+ exp(χ))). φm captures the average level of psychological refinancing costs, and depending on the model variation listed in the rows, χ and φm can be functions of demographic characteristics, and χ can also depend on mortgage age effects and current quarter effects. φsd, when included, estimates a random coefficient model for psychological refinancing costs. exp(β) captures responsiveness to incentives. Pseudo R 2 is calculated using the formula R 2 = 1-L1/L0, where L1 is the log likelihood from the model specified in the column header, and L0 is the log likelihood from a model which only allows for a constant probability of being asleep, a stochastic choice error, and a constant fixed psychological refinancing cost (i.e., Model 4). Out-of-sample pseudo R 2 for models 6 through 10 are estimated in expanding windows 2010-11, 2010-13, and 2010-15, and use the resulting estimates to forecast refinancing in three two-year windows 2012-13, 2014-15, and 2016-17. We used two approaches: The first approach set the time effects to the average value estimated over the in-sample expanding window. The second approach allows time fixed effects to be freely estimated in the out-of-sample windows. All coefficients in the table are significant at the 1% level or less. This figure shows the marginal change in the probability of being subject to time-dependent inaction, the estimated psychological costs of refinancing in 1,000 DKK, and the psychological cost increment to the interest-rate threshold to be surmounted to induce a household to refinance, all as functions of selected ranked variables: age, education, income, financial wealth, and housing wealth.We estimate our random coefficient specification using all households in Denmark with an unchanging number of household members, with a single fixed rate mortgage in the beginning of each year from 2010-2017.
