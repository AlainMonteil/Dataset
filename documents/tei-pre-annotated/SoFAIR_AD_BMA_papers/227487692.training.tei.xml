        <p>Using legitimacy and institutional theories, this study investigates whether lending institutions reward firms in 15 EU countries for their environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance and disclosure in terms of lowering their cost of debt capital. Our study distinguishes between ESG performance that is used to indicate an effective commitment to ESG strategies, and ESG disclosure that represents an effort to construct an image of commitment designed to positively influence stakeholders' perceptions. Supporting a version of legitimacy theory, we find that lending institutions value both ESG performance and disclosure and integrate ESG information in their credit decisionsin that firms with stronger ESG performance have a lower cost of debt, and ESG disclosure has an equal impact on the cost of debt as ESG performance. Although these findings suggest that the market (in context) can engender more desirable social outcomes by rewarding ESG practices, it fails to distinguish between ESG performance and disclosure (which may be contrasted as the more substantive and the more symbolic). Moreover, our results also reflect upon the importance of the role that civil society and the state play in addressing and exploring the limitations of free-market regimes. Specifically, we provide evidence that the impact of ESG performance and disclosure on the cost of debt is more dominant in the stakeholder-oriented countries (where the community is more prevalent). Our main findings are robust to a battery of sensitivity tests, including an alternative measure of the cost of debt, model specifications, and different approaches to address endogeneity. We acknowledge limitations in our research method but point nevertheless to its value in supporting a critical perspective and make suggestions for future research.Using legitimacy and institutional theories, this study investigates whether lending institutions reward firms in 15 EU countries for their environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance and disclosure in terms of lowering their cost of debt capital.

        <p>Different groups of corporate stakeholders have been exercising pressure on firms to go beyond the legally required level of environmental, social and governance (ESG1 ) practices and improve their impact on the environment and society. This rising trend was found by the latest Nielsen Global Survey on Corporate Social Responsibility in 2015 which reveals that 66% of global consumers are willing to pay more for sustainable brands compared to 55% in 2014, and that 73% of global millennials are willing to pay extra for sustainable offerings compared to 50% in 2014. 2 In this regard, most market-based research nowadays argues that efficient implementation of ESG practices enhances corporate financial performance (Hillman and Keim, 2001;Birindelli et al., 2015;Hoepner et al., 2016), as it creates and maintains a corporate competitive advantage (Hart, 1995;Shrivastava, 1995;Russo and Fouts, 1997;Aragón-Correa, 1998) by establishing long-term relationships with key corporate stakeholders (Freeman, 1984;Jones, 1995;Donaldson and Preston, 1995). According to a recent study by the United Nations, 89% of CEOs from more than 100 countries believe that their commitment to ESG practices is translating into real impact in terms of the financial success of their firms (United Nations, 2016).Different groups of corporate stakeholders have been exercising pressure on firms to go beyond the legally required level of environmental, social and governance (ESG1 ) practices and improve their impact on the environment and society.

        <p>Despite this wide recognition of the importance of ESG practices and the many positive initiatives globally that have been in place in relation to social and environmental practices, the world is still suffering from social inequities, violence, lack of basic requirements of life, and the state of the environment in general seems to be getting worse (Deegan, 2017). We believe this deterioration in the state of the environment and societies, in general, is the responsibility of business firms and governments and their failure to fulfil their obligations. As Deegan and Shelly (2014) point out, governments tend to believe that social and environmental practices should remain voluntary and be determined by market forces (in context) and take the side of business firms when it comes to debates about extending corporate accountability. A striking example of governments taking the side of firms at the expense of the wider community is how the United States President Donald Trump views the climate change treaty. He stated that this treaty would undermine the US economy and puts US firms at a permanent disadvantage. In 2017, Donald Trump announced that the US participation in the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change mitigation is suspended. Despite the increasingly deteriorating state of the environment and societies, business firms predominantly oppose any attempts to make social and environmental practices compulsory (Owen et al., 2000;Deegan and Shelly, 2014).Despite this wide recognition of the importance of ESG practices and the many positive initiatives globally that have been in place in relation to social and environmental practices, the world is still suffering from social inequities, violence, lack of basic requirements of life, and the state of the environment in general seems to be getting worse (Deegan, 2017).

        <p>(2) the symbolic approach, which involves the portrayal of firms' behaviour to show the firms to be consistent with social norms while their actual performance and policies may not change (Ashforth and Gibbs, 1990). Firms follow the second approach mainly to convince their key stakeholders, including lending institutions, to believe that they are committed to societal expectations irrespective of the extent to which it actually is or not (Michelon et al., 2015). Empirically, there has been a lack of research on which approach (substantive versus symbolic) firms follow to disclose their social and environmental performance. Most social accounting literature links social and environmental disclosure to the symbolic approach (Patten, 2002;Cho and Patten, 2007), while most of the market-based research links social and environmental disclosure to the substantive approach (Cormier and Magnan, 2007;Clarkson et al., 2008;Dhaliwal et al., 2012;Moser and Martin, 2012;Ge and Liu, 2015;Stellner et al., 2015;Erragragui, 2017).(2) the symbolic approach, which involves the portrayal of firms' behaviour to show the firms to be consistent with social norms while their actual performance and policies may not change (Ashforth and Gibbs, 1990).

        <p>These two contrasting views have motivated a sizeable amount of research on the economic consequences of ESG practices. There is, however, a scarcity of studies that examine the impact of ESG practices on the cost of debt (Erragragui, 2017). Consequently, little is known on whether lending institutions care about both ESG performance and disclosure of borrowing firms, and whether the effect of ESG disclosure in the absence of ESG performance (the symbolic approach) has a significant impact on lending institutions. Prior studies examining the association between ESG practices and the cost of debt either focused on a single country (e.g., Ge and Liu, 2015;Erragragui, 2017;Hasan et al., 2017) or used a small sample size (e.g., Hoepner et al., 2016;Jung et al., 2018;Stellner et al., 2015). Also, they used either ESG performance or ESG disclosure exchangeably as a measure of ESG practices. However, we believe that these two measures of ESG practices are different. While ESG performance measures what firms actually do, ESG disclosure is the communication of their ESG performance (Deegan, 2017), which respectively could be seen as the substantive approach and the symbolic approach.These two contrasting views have motivated a sizeable amount of research on the economic consequences of ESG practices.

        <p>Drawing on the legitimacy theory, our study empirically examines the impact of firms' ESG performance and disclosure on their cost of debt, and whether ESG disclosure has a moderating effect on the relationship between ESG performance and the cost of debt using a large sample obtained from 15 countries in the EU. We believe that ESG practices represent a crucial factor in determining the creditworthiness of a firm by lending institutions. We argue that lending institutions incorporate firms' ESG information in their lending decision to evaluate two types of risks imposed by these firms: default risk3 and reputational risk4 (Weber et al., 2010;Weber et al., 2014). Therefore, integrating information on a firm's ESG practices may mitigate these risks, reducing the cost of debt charged to that firm by lending institutions. Moreover, firms' practices are regulated by a whole series of forces that are never separate from each other, but these forces, such as the state, the market and community, can vary in their influence between contexts (Streeck and Schmitter, 1985). According to institutional theory, organisations adapting their processes to be aligned with externally codified rules, norms, or laws and with best practices in the sector (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983). Thus, ESG practices are shaped by deep-seated institutions rather than only by organisational-level microfactors. In such a setting, we argue that country' sustainability settings will determine the level of ESG performance and disclosure, as well as the market reward of these practices. To help better understand and define the impact of institutional forces on the relationship between the cost of debt and both ESG performance and disclosure, we investigate whether country sustainability characteristics, which can represent those forces, have a moderating effect on the relationship between firms' ESG practices and their cost of debt. Prior studies fail to control for country sustainability characteristics while examining this relationship. Therefore, it is not clear in prior studies whether country sustainability characteristics affect the relationship between the cost of debt and both ESG performance and disclosure.Drawing on the legitimacy theory, our study empirically examines the impact of firms' ESG performance and disclosure on their cost of debt, and whether ESG disclosure has a moderating effect on the relationship between ESG performance and the cost of debt using a large sample obtained from 15 countries in the EU.

        <p>This study contributes to the existing literature in different ways. First, it adds to the limited number of prior studies that examine the impact of firms' ESG performance and disclosure on their cost of debt, which provide conflicting results (Ye and Zhang, 2011;Aman and Nguyen, 2013;Hoepner et al., 2016;Crifo et al., 2017;Erragragui, 2017;Hasan et al., 2017). Using a sample of 6,018 firm-year observations of listed firms in the EU from 2005 to 2016, we find a significant negative association between the cost of debt and both ESG performance and disclosure. This finding sheds light on the significant role of ESG practices nowadays in lending institutions' creditworthiness valuation models. If lending institutions were to demand more ESG information, their relatively powerful position could motivate firms to strengthen their ESG performance and disclosure, which will be of benefit to other stakeholder groups.This study contributes to the existing literature in different ways.

        <p>Second, this study benefits from a unique data set obtained from the DataStream (ESG-ASSET4) and Bloomberg databases, which allows measuring both ESG performance and disclosure for the same firm sample list. In contrast to prior studies that examine the impact of ESG performance solely on the cost of debt, this study examines the impact of both ESG performance and disclosure. We believe that the two measures of ESG practices are different.Second, this study benefits from a unique data set obtained from the DataStream (ESG-ASSET4) and Bloomberg databases, which allows measuring both ESG performance and disclosure for the same firm sample list.

        <p>Disclosure can support the substantive approach or the symbolic approach. Therefore, we extend the contribution of this study by investigating the moderating effect of ESG disclosure on the relationship between ESG performance and the cost of debt. In this regard, we report evidence that ESG disclosure acts as a substitute, rather than as a compliment, to ESG performance in decreasing firms' cost of debt. This indicates that firms with poor ESG performance try to increase ESG disclosure to compensate (the symbolic approach). We provide evidence that ESG disclosure is more likely to be undertaken as a symbolic approach in the EU market, which is consistent with the social accounting literature in concluding that CSR disclosure is a tool to manage corporate image, instead of a substantive improvement in the accountability process (Moneva et al., 2006;Merkl-Davies and Brennan, 2007;Hopwood, 2009;Cho et al., 2012b;Michelon et al., 2015).Disclosure can support the substantive approach or the symbolic approach.

        <p>Third, in addition to using a comprehensive measure of ESG performance and disclosure, this study offers isolation of the impact of the individual dimensions of ESG performance and disclosure on the cost of debt. Mattingly (2017) point out the importance of using individual dimensions of ESG practices, in addition to a comprehensive measure, to capture the impact on the cost of debt. We provide evidence that lending institutions do value individual dimensions of ESG performance and disclosure, with the environmental dimension having the largest impact on the cost of debt.Third, in addition to using a comprehensive measure of ESG performance and disclosure, this study offers isolation of the impact of the individual dimensions of ESG performance and disclosure on the cost of debt.

        <p>Finally, this study contributes to the existing literature by investigating the moderating effect of country sustainability characteristics on the relationship between ESG practices and the cost of debt. While most of the prior research has focused mainly on country sustainability characteristics as a driver of ESG performance or disclosure (e.g., Jackson and Apostolakou, 2010;Ioannou and Serafeim, 2012), our study addresses its role in affecting the anticipated benefits of ESG performance and disclosure. We provide evidence that the impact of ESG performance and disclosure on the cost of debt is more obvious in countries that are more stakeholder-oriented. By doing so, we add to our understanding of how country sustainability characteristics explain the variations in the benefits associated with ESG practices. Also, this finding is consistent with the institutional theory that documents the significant role of institutional factors.Finally, this study contributes to the existing literature by investigating the moderating effect of country sustainability characteristics on the relationship between ESG practices and the cost of debt.

        <p>The academic debate on whether CSR practices have positive or negative economic consequences on firms started more than 50 years ago. During this period of time, different theories have been used to explain CSR practices such as agency, stakeholder, legitimacy and institutional theories. On one side, in 1958, Levitt expressed his concerns about firms' CSR practices and pointed out that "welfare and society are not the corporation's business. Its business is making money, not sweet music" (Levitt, 1958, p.47). This perspective is consistent with the credit decisions made by lending institutions based on the financial position and performance of the borrowing firm to estimate its default risk (Devalle et al., 2017). According to Levitt (1958), lending institutions are interested in verifiable and objective information, such as profitability, leverage, and liquidity of the borrowing firm to ensure its ability to repay the debt. Levitt's perspective was supported by Hemingway and Maclagan (2004), who point out that motivation for engaging in CSR practices is "greenwashing" to cover up for corporate misbehaviour. This, in turn, results in a riskier profile and a higher cost of debt for these firms (Jensen and Smith, 1985). On the other side, theories and recent empirical studies supporting the notion that ESG practices and firm profitability are not inversely related have started to emerge (Scholtens, 2006;Scholtens, 2009;Zeidan et al., 2015), indicating that firms' profitability is no longer enough for lending institutions to make their credit decisions (Birindelli et al., 2015;Hoepner et al., 2016).The academic debate on whether CSR practices have positive or negative economic consequences on firms started more than 50 years ago.

        <p>Based on legitimacy theory, firms continually aim to ensure that they are perceived as operating within the bounds and norms of their societies (Deegan and Unerman, 2011). So, firms attempt to ensure that their activities are perceived by externals as being legitimate. Therefore, firms should adopt practices that are able to influence societal appraisal to increase their legitimacy such as social and environmental practices including real activities and/or disclosure (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983;Deephouse, 1996;Suchman, 1995). In this regard, Neu et al. (1998), who use an impression management lens that can be linked to legitimacy theory, suggest that financial stakeholders such as banks are the most important stakeholder to the firms and that disclosures will be primarily tailored towards them in order to more effectively meet their needs.Based on legitimacy theory, firms continually aim to ensure that they are perceived as operating within the bounds and norms of their societies (Deegan and Unerman, 2011).

        <p>It is argued in the literature that society progressively assumes that firms will "... make outlays to repair or prevent damage to the physical environment, to ensure the health and safety of consumers, employees, and those who reside in the communities where products are manufactured and wastes are dumped ..." (Tinker and Neimark, 1987, p. 84). Therefore, firms with a poor ESG performance might find it difficult to get the necessary support and resources to continue working in a community that values ESG practices, e.g., higher cost of debt.It is argued in the literature that society progressively assumes that firms will "... make outlays to repair or prevent damage to the physical environment, to ensure the health and safety of consumers, employees, and those who reside in the communities where products are manufactured and wastes are dumped ..."

        <p>Legitimacy theory emphasises that firms should consider the rights of the public at large, not merely those of its investors. Failure to comply with societal expectations might lead to sanctions being imposed by society in the form of legal restrictions imposed on a firm's operations, or provide the firm with limited resources (e.g., higher cost of debt capital) (Deegan and Unerman, 2011).Legitimacy theory emphasises that firms should consider the rights of the public at large, not merely those of its investors.

        <p>While ESG disclosure is growing significantly in recent years, a clear debate has grown in the literature about the motivation behind adopting a specific ESG disclosure approach (e.g., Neu et al., 1998;Lewis and Unerman, 1999;Kolk et al., 2008;Ball and Craig, 2010;Burritt and Schaltegger, 2010;Cho et al., 2012a;Cho et al., 2015). This debate can be referenced to two main approaches. Firstly, the substantive management approach, which explains that the motivation for adopting ESG disclosure strategy is to gain legitimacy through real changes in the firms' actions through aligning their strategies to social norms. However, the second approach, named symbolic management approach, in which firms are engaging in apparent actions to affect stakeholders' perceptions (Ashforth and Gibbs, 1990). Engaging in those apparent actions lead stakeholders to believe that firms are committed to societal requirements (Ashforth and Gibbs, 1990). Based on this approach, firms with weak ESG performance tend to increase their level of ESG disclosure above their actual ESG performance (greenwashing) to gain the benefits associated with ESG practices, e.g., lower cost of debt. In this regard, recent research argues that firms use hypocrisy strategies to manage different stakeholder interests to maintain legitimacy (Brunsson, 2007;Cho et al., 2015). In other words, firms maintain legitimacy through ''camouflaging" their practices (Michelon et al., 2016). This framework offers a rich theoretical lens to explore how lending institutions as a main stakeholder group perceive ESG performance and disclosure. Therefore, whether ESG practices are used under a substantive or symbolic approach is, therefore, remains an open question.While ESG disclosure is growing significantly in recent years, a clear debate has grown in the literature about the motivation behind adopting a specific ESG disclosure approach (e.g., Neu et al., 1998;Lewis and Unerman, 1999;Kolk et al., 2008;Ball and Craig, 2010;Burritt and Schaltegger, 2010;Cho et al., 2012a;Cho et al., 2015). This debate can be referenced to two main approaches. Firstly, the substantive management approach, which explains that the motivation for adopting ESG disclosure strategy is to gain legitimacy through real changes in the firms' actions through aligning their strategies to social norms. However, the second approach, named symbolic management approach, in which firms are engaging in apparent actions to affect stakeholders' perceptions (Ashforth and Gibbs, 1990).

        <p>Within the substantive approach, it is expected to find that ESG disclosure acts as a compliment to ESG performance as it is driven by honest interest to improve transparency, the quality of information communicated and improve stakeholders' engagement process. However, within the symbolic approach, it is expected to find evidence that ESG disclosure acts as a substitute, rather a compliment, to ESG performance as disclosure might be used to show firms as ''committed'' (Guidry et al., 2012), and disclosure used here to facilitate the construction of an inaccurate company image (Hopwood, 2009).Within the substantive approach, it is expected to find that ESG disclosure acts as a compliment to ESG performance as it is driven by honest interest to improve transparency, the quality of information communicated and improve stakeholders' engagement process.

        <p>Although stakeholder and legitimacy theories have been adopted as popular explanations of social and environmental practices, they remain silent on politico-economic context (Gray et al., 1995;Spence et al., 2010;Deegan, 2010). Gray et al. (1995) delineate stakeholder and legitimacy theories as concerned with the legitimacy of firms whereas the institutional theory is defined as concerned with the legitimacy of the system. In this regard, ESG practices are viewed as "a social phenomenon that emerges from the actions and interactions of agents within a complex set of forces, including external economic forces and related ideologies, national economic conditions, state policies" (Ahmed andUddin, 2018, p. 2211). Given its societal orientation, ESG practices may be explained as an embedded practice shaped by deepseated institutions rather than only by organisational-level micro-factors.Although stakeholder and legitimacy theories have been adopted as popular explanations of social and environmental practices, they remain silent on politico-economic context (Gray et al., 1995;Spence et al., 2010;Deegan, 2010).

        <p>Prior studies have provided evidence that diverse institutional contexts lead to a variation in firm-level ESG performance and disclosure (e.g., Ahmed and Uddin, 2018;Baldini et al., 2018). DiMaggio and Powell (1983) theorised that organisations adapting their processes to nourish their legitimacy through the adoption of coercive (i.e. alignment with externally codified rules, laws, or norms), mimetic (i.e. alignment with best practices or managerial fads/fashions) or normative isomorphism (i.e. alignment with espoused standards set by educational/professional authorities). For instance, Matten and Moon (2008) document that pertinent social obligations are seen in Europe as the purview of government whereas US-style ESG practices are characterised by less regulation and more incentive and opportunity for business organisations to fill social niches.Prior studies have provided evidence that diverse institutional contexts lead to a variation in firm-level ESG performance and disclosure (e.g., Ahmed and Uddin, 2018;Baldini et al., 2018).

        <p>In such a setting, decisions regarding ESG issues are framed vis a vis a broader social context and thereby the level of ESG performance and disclosure, as well as the market reward of these practices, vary across countries because of the diversity in the institutional settings (Jackson and Apostolakou, 2010;Baldini et al., 2018). In particular, we argue that the market will reward ESG practices when stakeholder orientation 'community' is more prevalent. By doing so, our study contributes to not only the existing academic debate around ESG practices but also related policies and regulations.In such a setting, decisions regarding ESG issues are framed vis a vis a broader social context and thereby the level of ESG performance and disclosure, as well as the market reward of these practices, vary across countries because of the diversity in the institutional settings (Jackson and Apostolakou, 2010;Baldini et al., 2018).

        <p>The growing attention paid to ESG issues5 has led to an increase in lending institutions' awareness of reputational risk imposed by borrowing firms in addition to default risk. This means that lending institutions can be perceived by society as facilitators of negative ESG practices conducted by borrowing firms, resulting in adverse stakeholder reactions to these lending institutions. These risks represent incentives for lending institutions to integrate ESG information into their creditworthiness evaluation process.The growing attention paid to ESG issues5 has led to an increase in lending institutions' awareness of reputational risk imposed by borrowing firms in addition to default risk.

        <p>The recognition of this link by lending institutions and other stakeholder groups increased since many lending institutions around the world signed the United Nations Environment Programme's Statement by Banks on the Environment and Sustainable Development (UNEP, 2012). Thereafter, lending institutions started to integrate ESG information in their internal operations by including it in their checklist for risk assessment and management. Thompson and Cowton (2004) find that 60% of banks in the UK had a formal corporate lending policy which incorporated ESG considerations. Furthermore, the increasing awareness of ESG practices by society also provides lending institutions with an opportunity to make their ESG stance central to their activities or brands (Thompson and Cowton, 2004;Weber et al., 2014).The recognition of this link by lending institutions and other stakeholder groups increased since many lending institutions around the world signed the United Nations Environment Programme's Statement by Banks on the Environment and Sustainable Development (UNEP, 2012).

        <p>Despite the worldwide recognition of the importance of ESG practices by firms, their impact on the cost of debt in academia is still a controversial issue. On the one hand, some studies provide evidence of the inverse relationship between ESG performance and the cost of debt (Hasan et al., 2017;Ge and Liu, 2015;Goss and Roberts, 2011;Ye and Zhang, 2011;Crifo et al., 2017) On the other hand, other studies find an insignificant or even a positive relationship between ESG performance and the cost of debt (Erragragui, 2017;Stellner et al., 2015;Hoepner et al., 2016). The conceptual link between ESG disclosure and the cost of debt is even more obvious. ESG disclosure is different from ESG performance because it provides additional information, such as, a risk management framework that demonstrates the firms' awareness of their ESG weaknesses and how it is going to mitigate their negative impacts. For example, Jung et al. (2016) find that lending institutions incorporate a firm's exposure to carbon-related risk into lending decisions, and that the impact of that risk on increasing its cost of debt is mitigated when the firm shows awareness of the risk and willingness to decrease through disclosure of plans for new capital investments using green technology. Furthermore, a higher level of ESG disclosure is linked to lower information asymmetry between borrowing firms and lending institutions, and hence lowers the cost of debt. In a similar vein, Dennis and Mullineaux (2000) point out that as information about the borrowing firm becomes more transparent, the debt contract becomes more saleable. Aman and Nguyen (2013) find that firms can mitigate agency conflicts and reduce risk to debtholders by lowering information asymmetry through a higher level of disclosure.Despite the worldwide recognition of the importance of ESG practices by firms, their impact on the cost of debt in academia is still a controversial issue.

        <p>Although this conceptual link between ESG disclosure and the cost of debt is clear, there is a scarcity of empirical studies that examine this association. Of particular importance to our study, Dhaliwal et al. (2011a) examine internal control disclosure by 577 US-listed firms as a mechanism of corporate governance and its impact on the cost of debt. They provide evidence that disclosure of corporate governance material weaknesses results in increased cost of debt. Gao et al.

        <p>While accounting standards require specific ESG information to be disclosed in the annual reports (e.g., asset retirement obligations, contingencies related to environmental clean-up, etc.), the significant portion of ESG disclosure remains voluntary and unregulated (Fatemi et al., 2017;Nazari et al., 2017). This has resulted in variations in the level of ESG disclosure by firms. A large percentage of these variations is determined by ESG performance as a major determinant of the ESG disclosure policy adopted by firms. Many studies find a significant association between the two components of ESG practices (Al-Tuwaijri et al., 2004;Clarkson et al., 2008). As mentioned in the theoretical framework section, Ashforth and Gibbs (1990) determine two approaches that firms follow regarding social and environmental disclosure.While accounting standards require specific ESG information to be disclosed in the annual reports (e.g., asset retirement obligations, contingencies related to environmental clean-up, etc.), the significant portion of ESG disclosure remains voluntary and unregulated (Fatemi et al., 2017;Nazari et al., 2017).

        <p>Firms use the substantive approach to pose themselves in the market as being committed to a strong ESG performance and distinguish themselves from poor ESG performers (Cahan et al., 2016). However, the lack of regulation of ESG disclosure provides managers with an opportunity to deliberately manipulate their ESG disclosure to signal high ESG commitment when their ESG performance is actually poor (the symbolic approach). For example, Nazari et al. (2017) find that firms listed on the S&amp;P 500 index with poor ESG performance intensify their ESG disclosure by using more complex syntax that is difficult to understand, aiming to impress readers in order to hide poor performance. Also, Michelon et al. (2015) find that UK listed firms tend to dilute information in their CSR stand-alone report with other pieces of irrelevant information, portraying the firm as CSR committed and camouflaging important items of its disclosure. Other studies, in contrast, argue that managers might fear that investors would punish them for the high costs of ESG practices. Therefore, managers choose to understate their actual ESG performance (brownwashing) (see Kim and Lyon, 2014).Firms use the substantive approach to pose themselves in the market as being committed to a strong ESG performance and distinguish themselves from poor ESG performers (Cahan et al., 2016).

        <p>This study investigates the impact of ESG practices on the cost of debt. Two commonly used proxies of ESG practices are available; Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg ESG ratings. While Thomson Reuters ESG ratings, collected from the DataStream (ESG-ASSET4), represent a metric of ESG performance, Bloomberg focuses on a firm's level of ESG disclosure (Ioannou and Serafeim, 2012;Baldini et al., 2016;Fatemi et al., 2017). Thomson Reuters ESG ratings are designed to measure a company's relative ESG performance, commitment, and effectiveness across three main dimensions that cover 10 themes. These dimensions are environmental (resource use, emissions, and innovation), social (workforce, human rights, community, and product responsibility) and governance (management, shareholders, and CSR strategy). They are considered a comprehensive evaluation of the company's sustainability impact and conduct based on the reported data in the public domain, and Thomson Reuters ESG controversy score (Thomson Reuters, 2017). 7 In contrast, ESG disclosure ratings, using the Bloomberg database index, are based on the information available in firms' annual reports, corporate social responsibility reports, and on their websites. Bloomberg ESG disclosure scores rate companies annually based on their disclosure of quantitative and policy-related ESG data (Huber and Comstock, 2017). Bloomberg ESG data includes 120 ESG indicators (e.g., carbon emissions, climate change effect, pollution, renewable energy, political contributions, discrimination, diversity, community relations, and human rights). Moreover, both Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg provide a score for the three individual dimensions [Environmental (E), Social (S), and Governance (G)] to measure ESG performance and the level of its related disclosure.This study investigates the impact of ESG practices on the cost of debt.

        <p>To test the interaction effects between ESG performance and ESG disclosure, we transform the ESG disclosure score to a dummy variable.

        <p>Our main tests examine whether ESG performance and disclosure affect the cost of debt. To measure the cost of debt, we use the accounting measure, calculated as the ratio of a firm's interest expense to its average debt (Francis et al., 2005;Gray et al., 2009). A meta-analysis conducted by Orlitzky et al. (2003) find that ESG performance is more correlated to accounting-based measures than to market-based measures. Also, credit ratings based on the evaluation of the Fitch agency is used as a robustness measure of the cost of debt. Previous empirical studies have established a relationship between ESG practices and credit ratings as a proxy for the cost of debt. For example, Bauer and Hann (2010) find that legal, reputational, and regulatory risks associated with environmental incidents lead to lower credit ratings. Also, Ashbaugh-Skaife et al. (2006) indicate that credit ratings are affected by corporate governance mechanisms. Other studies used a comprehensive measure of corporate social responsibility and found that better corporate social responsibility performance is associated with better credit ratings (Ge and Liu, 2015;Oikonomou et al., 2014;Devalle et al., 2017).Our main tests examine whether ESG performance and disclosure affect the cost of debt. To measure the cost of debt, we use the accounting measure, calculated as the ratio of a firm's interest expense to its average debt (Francis et al., 2005;Gray et al., 2009). A meta-analysis conducted by Orlitzky et al. (2003) find that ESG performance is more correlated to accounting-based measures than to market-based measures. Also, credit ratings based on the evaluation of the Fitch agency is used as a robustness measure of the cost of debt. Previous empirical studies have established a relationship between ESG practices and credit ratings as a proxy for the cost of debt. For example, Bauer and Hann (2010) find that legal, reputational, and regulatory risks associated with environmental incidents lead to lower credit ratings. Also, Ashbaugh-Skaife et al. (2006) indicate that credit ratings are affected by corporate governance mechanisms. Other studies used a comprehensive measure of corporate social responsibility and found that better corporate social responsibility performance is associated with better credit ratings (Ge and Liu, 2015;Oikonomou et al., 2014;Devalle et al., 2017).</p>
        <p>Based on prior studies, there are four control variables consistently found to be significantly related to the cost of debt. These variables are the firm size (Size), leverage (LEV), return on assets (ROA), and interest coverage rate (IntCov). We measure Size as a natural logarithm of total assets in year t. We expect to find a negative relationship between Size and the cost of debt. Firms with large Size are expected to have more resources for external finance at a lower cost than those with small Size (Erragragui, 2017;Hasan et al., 2017). LEV is the ratio of total debt to total assets in year t. We expect to find a positive association between LEV and the cost of debt. Those firms with a lower level of LEV are expected to have better solvency and lower interest rate than firms with a higher level of LEV (Tran, 2014;Jung et al., 2016;Goh et al., 2016;Erragragui, 2017). ROA is the net income before extraordinary items divided by total assets. A negative association is also expected between ROA and the cost of debt. Firms with high ROA are in better financial position and often acquire loans with lower interest rates (Aman and Nguyen, 2013;Ge and Liu, 2015;Arena, 2018). IntCov is the total operating income divided by total interest expense. IntCov is a measure of a firm's capabilities to pay its interest. So, it is likely that firms with a higher rate of interest coverage to have a lower cost of debt (Francis et al., 2005;Gray et al., 2009;Hoepner et al., 2016;Erragragui, 2017). Moreover, our study uses a combined proxy for country sustainability characteristics (Stake) developed by Dhaliwal et al. (2012) to measure the legal and social norms of different countries. This proxy is based on attributes highlighted by the stakeholder theory describing the relative importance of stakeholder groups such as power, legitimacy, and salience as in Mitchell et al. (1997). This proxy is the principal factor of four attributes related to assessing the legal environment of a country in protecting labour, the existence of country's environmental laws and regulations, the level of public awareness of corporate social responsibility issues, and surveys of the views of corporate executive officers on corporate social activities. 8 All variables are defined in Appendix A.Based on prior studies, there are four control variables consistently found to be significantly related to the cost of debt.

        <p>Table 3 reports the correlations among the primary variables. It is noted that the cost of debt is negatively correlated with both ESG performance and its related disclosure.

        <p>Moreover, the correlation between ESG performance and disclosure is high (0.61) but far from a perfect correlation suggesting that ESG performance and disclosure capture different attributes of ESG ratings.9 This finding is consistent with prior studies that found a correlation between disclosure and performance. For example, Al-Tuwaijri et al. ( 2004) find that good environmental performance is positively associated with good environmental disclosure. In a recent study, Nazari et al. (2017) examine the relationship between the complexity of corporate social responsibility disclosure and actual corporate social responsibility performance. They find a positive association between actual corporate social responsibility performance and readability and the level of corporate social responsibility disclosure. Indeed, the correlation coefficient also suggests that for at least some companies, the ESG performance and disclosure are negatively correlated or at least not correlated. Therefore, the use of both attributes will provide a clear understanding of the anticipated impact of ESG practices on the cost of debt.Moreover, the correlation between ESG performance and disclosure is high (0.61) but far from a perfect correlation suggesting that ESG performance and disclosure capture different attributes of ESG ratings.9 This finding is consistent with prior studies that found a correlation between disclosure and performance.

        <p>In this section, we present three sets of tests to examine the association between ESG practices and the cost of debt. First, we examine the impact of ESG performance and disclosure along with individual dimensions on the cost of debt. Second, we examine the moderating effect of ESG disclosure on the association between ESG performance and the cost of debt. Finally, we examine the moderating effect of country sustainability characteristics on the association between ESG practices and the cost of debt.

        <p>Following Francis et al. (2005), we include the firm characteristics that are reported to be affecting the cost of debt. Along with ESG-perform and ESG-disclose, we include Size, LEV, ROA, IntCov, and Stake. Table 4 column 1 reports the results of estimating equation 1 using ESG-perform as an independent variable. The results show a significant negative association between ESG performance and the cost of debt. The estimated coefficient of ESG-perform is 0.011 and is statistically significant at 1% level (t-statistics 2.76). Consistent with our prediction, the result indicates that firms with higher ESG performance have a lower cost of debt. These results can be interpreted as a sign that as ESG performance increases, the amount of interest that lending institutions are willing to receive for a pound of debt for such firms decreases. This means that lending institutions do integrate information about ESG performance of borrowing firms when evaluating their risk profile in their lending decision model, which is consistent with previous studies (Goss and Roberts, 2011;Nandy and Lodh, 2012;Aman and Nguyen, 2013;Ge and Liu, 2015;Hasan et al., 2017;Crifo et al., 2017) and thus supports the first hypothesis (H1).Following Francis et al.

        <p>Moving to control variables, we find that the signs of their coefficients are largely consistent with findings in the existing literature (e.g., Francis et al., 2005;Gray et al., 2009;Erragragui, 2017)). In particular, the results show significant negative associations between the cost of debt and Size, ROA and IntCov. Firms with high IntCov have a lower cost of debt, and large firms have a relatively lower cost of debt compared to small firms (Erragragui, 2017;Hasan et al., 2017). Also, the results show that firms with high LEV have a higher cost of debt (Tran, 2014;Goh et al., 2016;Jung et al., 2016;Erragragui, 2017). Finally, the results show that the cost of debt is lower for firms from countries with greater stakeholders orientation such as Denmark than for those firms from countries with lower stakeholders orientation such as Greece (Mitchell et al., 1997;Dhaliwal et al., 2012).Moving to control variables, we find that the signs of their coefficients are largely consistent with findings in the existing literature (e.g., Francis et al., 2005;Gray et al., 2009;Erragragui, 2017)).

        <p>We decompose the total score of ESG performance into their individual dimensions, which are the environmental, the social, and the governance dimensions and test the associations between these dimensions and the cost of debt. Table 5 (panels A) reports the results of estimating equation one after replacing the ESG performance score with its individual dimensions. We find a significant negative association between the cost of debt and both the environmental and social dimensions, but not the corporate governance dimension, of ESG performance. The environmental dimension has the largest impact on the cost of debt with a coefficient of -0.012 (t-statistics -3.41), then the social dimension with a coefficient of -0.012 (t-statistics -3.18).We decompose the total score of ESG performance into their individual dimensions, which are the environmental, the social, and the governance dimensions and test the associations between these dimensions and the cost of debt.

        <p>(2017) find that higher levels of social capital incur lower bank loan spreads. Jung et al. (2018) find that the environmental impact of high carbon emissions is related to a higher cost of debt. Also, Nandy and Lodh (2012) find that a more eco-friendly firm gets a more favourable loan contract than do the firms with a lower environment score. In addition, Erragragui (2017) examines the impact of environmental and corporate governance dimensions of corporate social responsibility performance. He reports a negative impact for good performance in corporate governance on the cost of debt. However, similar to our finding, he reports an insignificant relationship for weaknesses of corporate governance. The insignificant relationship between the corporate governance dimension and the cost of debt is inconsistent with prior studies that provide evidence that good governance is associated with higher credit ratings and lower cost of debt (Aman and Nguyen, 2013;Andrade et al., 2014;Erragragui, 2017).(2017) find that higher levels of social capital incur lower bank loan spreads.

        <p>We argue that the insignificant relationship between the corporate governance dimension and the cost of debt may be offset by the inverse relationship between the environmental and social dimensions and the cost of debt. We believe that lending institutions use the collective and integrative impact of the individual dimensions of ESG performance to determine the reliability and trustworthiness of the firm's management team to make their lending decisions. Many authors emphasised the concept of management quality and its impact on the cost of debt, and how lending institutions take into account risk arising from good or poor management practices concluded from the individual dimensions of ESG performance (e.g., Rahaman and Al Zaman, 2013). This finding suggests the need for further investigation of the effectiveness of corporate governance mechanisms and its impact on the cost of debt.We argue that the insignificant relationship between the corporate governance dimension and the cost of debt may be offset by the inverse relationship between the environmental and social dimensions and the cost of debt.

        <p>Regarding ESG disclosure, Table 4 (column 2) reports the results of estimating equation 1 using ESG-disclose as an independent variable. In this regard, the results show a significant negative association between ESG disclosure and the cost of debt.

For example, using a comprehensive measure of corporate social responsibility disclosure, Gao et al. (2016) find an inverse relationship between corporate social responsibility disclosure and the cost of debt.Regarding ESG disclosure, Table 4 (column 2) reports the results of estimating equation 1 using ESG-disclose as an independent variable.

        <p>Similar to ESG performance, we decompose the total score of ESG disclosure into its individual dimensions. Consistent with our expectations, results in Table 5 (panel B) reveal that the three individual dimensions have a significant inverse relationship with the cost of debt. The environmental dimension of ESG disclosure has the largest impact on the cost of debt with a coefficient of -0.018 (t-statistics -2.41), followed by the corporate governance dimension with a coefficient of -0.018 (t-statistics -1.93). The social dimension has the lowest impact on the cost of debt with a coefficient of -0.016 (t-statistics -1.68). The largest impact of environmental performance and disclosure on the cost of debt indicates that lending institutions prioritise integrating environmental information in their creditworthiness evaluation process, and most likely for the purpose of evaluating the reputational risk associated with environmental issues imposed by borrowing firms. This finding suggests that firms struggling to finance their ESG practices due to limited resources should devote the largest portion of these resources to their environmental practices.Similar to ESG performance, we decompose the total score of ESG disclosure into its individual dimensions.

        <p>In general, these findings are consistent with ESG practice-related theories supporting the notion that firms' ESG practices enhance their financial performance. The negative relationship between ESG practices (performance and disclosure) and the cost of debt indicates that these practices help mitigate the agency conflict between shareholders and debtholders (Jensen and Smith, 1985).In general, these findings are consistent with ESG practice-related theories supporting the notion that firms' ESG practices enhance their financial performance.

        <p>According to stakeholder theory, stewardship theory and transformational leadership theory, ESG practices are used by firms to send a strong signal to lending institutions about the efficiency and integrity of their management. This level of efficiency and integrity is indicated by a management's decision to allocate part of a firm's financial resources to satisfy the needs of different groups of corporate stakeholders (other than shareholders), while at the same time improving the financial performance of firms. This trustworthy behaviour by a firm's management helps lending institutions better value the risk associated with their decisions that can increase the wealth of stockholders while reducing the wealth of debtholders (such as dividend payout, claim dilution, asset substitution and underinvestment), resulting in a lower cost of capital charged to a borrowing firm. Furthermore, ESG practices help reduce information asymmetry between borrowing firms and lending institutions by providing lending institutions with the ESG information necessary to make sure that they are not connected with business activities that have a negative impact on the environment or the broader society, and evaluate the reputational risk associated with their credit decisions.According to stakeholder theory, stewardship theory and transformational leadership theory, ESG practices are used by firms to send a strong signal to lending institutions about the efficiency and integrity of their management.

        <p>To test our second hypothesis that ESG disclosure has a moderating effect on the relationship between ESG performance and the cost of debt, we transform the ESG disclosure score to a dummy variable. We first calculate the median of ESG disclosure every year, then we give the value of one if firms have higher ESG disclosure score than the median and zero otherwise.To test our second hypothesis that ESG disclosure has a moderating effect on the relationship between ESG performance and the cost of debt, we transform the ESG disclosure score to a dummy variable.

        <p>Then, we include an interaction term between ESG-perform and this variable in our main regression. Our study expects a significant impact of ESG disclosure effect on the relationship between ESG performance and the cost of debt (Al-Tuwaijri et al., 2004;Clarkson et al., 2008;Dhaliwal et al., 2011b;Lyon and Maxwell, 2011;Gao et al., 2016).Then, we include an interaction term between ESG-perform and this variable in our main regression.

        <p>Consistent with H2, Table 4 (column 3) shows a significant effect of the ESG disclosure on the relationship between ESG performance and the cost of debt.

        <p>This suggests the existence of a substitution relationship between ESG performance and disclosure. More specifically, the ESG disclosure acts as a substitute for ESG performance and, therefore, compensate for low ESG performance suggesting that firms with low ESG performance tend to increase ESG disclosure to gain the benefits associated with ESG practices, e.g., lower cost of debt. This result is consistent with the notion that ESG disclosure is used by firms to enhance their reputation and to gain the benefits associated with ESG disclosure (Brown and Deegan, 1998;Cho and Patten, 2007;Dhaliwal et al., 2011b;Li et al., 2018). This finding is also consistent with Fatemi et al. (2017) who find that firms with ESG concerns benefit from ESG-related disclosure; however, it is contradictory to Gao et al. (2016) who document a negative association between corporate social responsibility disclosures and the cost of debt only when corporate social responsibility performance is high.10This suggests the existence of a substitution relationship between ESG performance and disclosure.

        <p>and both ESG performances and disclosure in our main regression. This interaction term captures the difference in the effects of ESG performance and disclosure on the cost of debt between those countries with greater or lower stakeholder orientation. Thus, we expect the impact of ESG practices on the cost of debt to be greater in countries that are more stakeholderoriented. 3) Columns 4 and 5 in Table 4 show a significant effect of Stake on the relationship between both ESG-perform and ESG-disclose and the cost of debt. The two coefficients of the interaction are significant at 1% and 5% respectively (β = -0.015 ***, β = -0.023 *** ) suggesting that the impact of ESG performance and disclosure on the cost of debt are more obvious in countries that are more stakeholder-oriented. Thus, we accept the third hypothesis (H3). In this regard, the coefficient of ESG-perform*ESG-disclose is significantly positive, at the 10% level (β= 0.021 * ) in column (4) and insignificantly positive in column (5). This supports the previous finding of a substitution relationship between ESG performance and ESG disclosure. These findings are in line with previous studies in that the variation in the benefits associated with ESG performance and disclosure, in the form of a lower cost of debt, is determined by the country sustainability characteristics (Ball et al., 2000;Ahmed et al., 2013;Christensen et al., 2016;Capelle-Blancard et al., 2016). For instance, Ioannou and Serafeim (2012) find that country-level institutions drive social and environmental performance. Our study extends this to show that variations in the benefits associated with ESG performance and disclosure can be attributed to variation in the country sustainability characteristics. These findings are also consistent with institutional theory, in that organisations are embedded within broader social structures that influence both corporations' decisions as well as stakeholders' perceptions of ESG practices (Campbell, 2007;Aguilera et al., 2007;Jackson and Apostolakou, 2010).and both ESG performances and disclosure in our main regression.

        <p>In this section, we report sensitivity tests that have been performed to examine whether our primary evidence on the association between ESG practices and the cost of debt is robust to alternative assumptions and model specifications. Overall, the results from these sensitivity tests are not quantitatively different from those of the primary analysis. First, we specify, in the main analysis, our dependent variable as the cost of debt, which is measured as the ratio of a firm's interest expense to its average total debt. As an alternative proxy, we use credit ratings 11 instead of a firm's interest rate as a measure of its cost of debt (Ge and Liu, 2015;Oikonomou et al., 2014;Devalle et al., 2017). We find a significant positive association between ESG performance and the credit ratings, which is consistent with the findings of the main analysis.In this section, we report sensitivity tests that have been performed to examine whether our primary evidence on the association between ESG practices and the cost of debt is robust to alternative assumptions and model specifications.

        <p>Secondly, similar to related ESG studies, one concern in relation to the analysis is the potential endogeneity and omitted variables bias, which may diminish the interpretation of the causal relationship between ESG and the cost of debt. For instance, although we control for important variables that affect the cost of debt, the evidence on the importance of ESG to debt pricing might be driven by omitted variables that are correlated with both ESG and the cost of debt. Also, a firm's choice regarding whether to engage in ESG activities might not be independent of its cost of debt, in which case our analysis may be subject to reverse causality concerns (See 11 Credit rating variable has been collected from the Thomson Reuters Asset4 database which is based on Fitch Rating: (AAA (24 points); AA+ (23 points); AA (22 points); AA-(21 points); A+ (20 points); A (19 points); A-(18 points); BBB+ (17 points); BBB (16 points); BBB-(15 points); BB+ (14 points); BB (13 points); BB-(12 points); B+ (11 points); B (10 points); B-(9 points); CCC+ (8 points); CCC (7 points); CCC-(6 points); CC+ (5 points); CC (4 points); CC-(3 points); C (2 points); D (1 points); DD (1 points); DDD (1 points)). Then all values are divided by 24 to rank all values between 0 to 1. Waddock and Graves, 1997). In particular, two approaches are used to ensure the robustness of our results to endogeneity and reverse causality concerns. First, we employ the instrumental variables estimation method to the main model. We use the industry average scores of ESG performance and disclosure, and a dummy variable for whether the previous year's earnings is negative (loss) as instrumental variables for ESG performance and disclosure ratings. Also, to mitigate the issue of reverse causality (i.e., the cost of debt in the previous period affects current ESG investment), we follow El Ghoul et al. ( 2011) and Chen et al. (2011) and include the lagged cost of debt as an independent variable. This dynamic panel model is estimated using the system GMM technique developed in Blundell and Bond (1998). In both of these tests, the results indicate that endogeneity concerns are not likely to be driving our primary evidence.Secondly, similar to related ESG studies, one concern in relation to the analysis is the potential endogeneity and omitted variables bias, which may diminish the interpretation of the causal relationship between ESG and the cost of debt.

        <p>Third, our sample shows a high representation of UK firms, which is a common characteristic of sample distributions in most of the EU-based studies (e.g., Daske et al., 2008;Aharony et al., 2010;Byard et al., 2011;Glaum et al., 2013). To ensure the robustness of the findings, we regress the main models after excluding the UK firms from the sample, and the findings remain the same. Results are reported in Table 8. Fourthly, we use panel regressions with fixed and random effects for the cost of debt. Based on the Hausman test, it is found that the fixed-effects model is more appropriate than the random-effects model. Based on the fixed-effects model, there is a significant negative association between both ESG performance and disclosure and the cost of debt. Also, we find a significant effect of the ESG disclosure on the relationship between ESG performance and the cost of debt, which is consistent with the findings of the main test. However, we find no significant effect of Stake on the relationship between both ESG-perform and ESG-disclose and the cost of debt.

        <p>We find, in general, firms in code-law countries have a significantly lower cost of debt than firms in common-law countries.

        <p>Finally, we investigate whether the cost of debt reaction to firms' ESG performance and disclosure is a function of its default risk by regressing the same model after adding a dummy variable of default risk (based on the size of the leverage (i.e. above median and below median)) and its interaction with ESG performance and disclosure. In this regard, prior studies employ leverage to control for default risk (e.g., Baker et al., 2003;Verwijmeren and Derwall, 2010;Sun and Cui, 2014;Cheng et al., 2014). For example, Baker et al. (2003) find that firms with high leverage are less capable of obtaining more debt financing because the probability of default is already high. Likewise, Verwijmeren and Derwall (2010) document that firms reduce the probability of default risk and bankruptcy by operating with lower debt ratios. Also, Sun and Cui (2014) find that firm's leverage is positively related to default risk. We find that both ESG performance and disclosure have significant associations with the cost of debt in both types of firms. However, this association is weaker in default risk firms (results not reported).Finally, we investigate whether the cost of debt reaction to firms' ESG performance and disclosure is a function of its default risk by regressing the same model after adding a dummy variable of default risk (based on the size of the leverage (i.e. above median and below median)) and its interaction with ESG performance and disclosure.

        <p>The primary aim of this paper is to gain a deeper understanding of the consequences of ESG performance and its related disclosures that occur in the context of the European Union. Based on the legitimacy and institutional theories, there are three objectives of this paper. Firstly, we address whether lending institutions can interfere in the relationship between firms, state and the community to motivate firms to improve their ESG performance and its related disclosures. Specifically, we examine whether lending institutions reward firms in 15 EU countries for their ESG performance and disclosure in the form of lowering their cost of debt capital. Secondly, given that, the social accounting literature links ESG disclosures to the symbolic approach (e.g., Patten, 2002;Cho and Patten, 2007;Milne and Gray, 2013), we investigate whether lending institutions will distinguish between ESG performance and disclosures (substantive versus symbolic approaches) as part of their lending decision. Thirdly, building on institutional theory, we address the role of the state and community in shaping the effects of ESG performance and disclosures on the lending decision model.The primary aim of this paper is to gain a deeper understanding of the consequences of ESG performance and its related disclosures that occur in the context of the European Union.

        <p>Using a sample of 6,018 firm-year observations, our findings suggest that firms can benefit from increasing the level of ESG performance and disclosure, which in turn are translated into a lower cost of capital charged by lending institutions. These findings imply that market forces, represented by lending institutions, can initially play a role in improving the relevance and credibility of ESG performance and disclosure and impact sustainable development.Using a sample of 6,018 firm-year observations, our findings suggest that firms can benefit from increasing the level of ESG performance and disclosure, which in turn are translated into a lower cost of capital charged by lending institutions.

        <p>Nevertheless, our finding also documented that not only does ESG disclosure have an equal impact on the cost of debt, but also acts as a substitute for ESG Thus, although market forces in the context, represented by decisions and practices of lending institutions, lead to relatively desirable social outcomes through rewarding ESG performance and disclosures, there is a failure to distinguish between ESG performance and disclosure (substantive and symbolic approaches).Nevertheless, our finding also documented that not only does ESG disclosure have an equal impact on the cost of debt, but also acts as a substitute for ESG Thus, although market forces in the context, represented by decisions and practices of lending institutions, lead to relatively desirable social outcomes through rewarding ESG performance and disclosures, there is a failure to distinguish between ESG performance and disclosure (substantive and symbolic approaches).</p>
        <p>Moreover, we find that stakeholder orientation at a country level (consistent with a more community orientated approach) shapes the effects of ESG disclosure and practices on the cost of debt. In particular, the reported evidence suggests that the impact of ESG practices on the cost of debt is more dominant in stakeholder-oriented countries (where community is more prevalent). This, in turn, suggests that ESG practices may be appropriately assessed by civil society as a potential agent for securing change in business behaviour (Deegan, 2017). These findings also reflect upon the importance of the role that the civil society and the state play in addressing and exploring the limitations of free-market regimes. For instance, Maignan (2001) documented that French and German consumers are relatively more concerned about firms conforming to legal and ethical standards than U.S. consumers who instead give greater weighting to the narrower appreciation of corporate economic responsibilities. In line with this, our findings suggest that the market lead to more desired social outcomes (i.e. rewarding ESG practices by lowering cost of debt) when firms belong to a country in which stakeholder groups such as employees, consumers, the government, and communities are likely to have a greater influence on firms' operational decisions.Moreover, we find that stakeholder orientation at a country level (consistent with a more community orientated approach) shapes the effects of ESG disclosure and practices on the cost of debt.

        <p>The results of our study have academic and practical implications. Our findings support the idea of complementary roles between market, state and communities. Our findings suggest that the market play a role in motivating ESG practices by firms (i.e. by rewarding ESG performance and its related disclosures). They also documented that the rewarding of ESG performance and disclosure is higher when the state and community, as measured by the level of stakeholder orientation is more prevalent. This, in turn, implies that the state and community reinforce the role of the 'free market' through demand from social constituents, sanctions and boycott or mandatory requirements by the government. Thus, our findings should be of interest to regulators and policymakers, who are considering mandating ESG practices in their respective contexts.The results of our study have academic and practical implications.

        <p>Although this study sheds new light on the association between ESG practices and the cost of debt, it has a number of limitations that represent avenues for future research. First, this study employed secondary data obtained from specialised databases (Thomson Reuters Asset4, Bloomberg, and Thomson Reuters DataStream). Although these databases are widely accepted in management and accounting literature, collecting primary data would strongly support our findings. For example, interviewing CEOs of lending institutions in European countries on the lending decision process, and developing an index for measuring ESG practices manually.Although this study sheds new light on the association between ESG practices and the cost of debt, it has a number of limitations that represent avenues for future research.

        <p>Furthermore, our research findings on the association between ESG practices and the cost of debt might be dependent upon the measures of ESG practices we employed. Therefore, the choice of how to measure ESG practices and how it impacts the economic consequences of ESG practices represents an avenue for future research. Second, we use the ratio of a firm's interest expense to its average debt as an accounting measure of the cost of debt, which could be noisy if a firm changes its level of debt near year-end. Although we use credit rating as a robust measure of the cost of debt, future research can employ or develop enhanced measures of the cost of debt to overcome this limitation. Finally, our study focuses on non-financial listed firms in 15 countries in the EU; it would be interesting for future research to expand the sample to include countries with emerging economies and diverse cultural and different institutional settings to investigate whether it will impact the association between ESG practices and the cost of debt.
