        <p>The advancement in technology has fostered the prevalence of the Internet of Things (IoT), which enhances healthcare business quality, offers a seamless customer experience, and maximizes turnovers and profits. Consequently, omnichannel services have emerged by integrating online and offline channels and providing customers with more real-time information and services to increase their engagement. Healthcare wearable devices appear as a salient tool to connect healthcare providers and patients and thus become an essential part of the omnichannel environment. Along with this trend, the ethical concerns while using these devices have increasingly intensified and are significant barriers to market expansion. Nevertheless, there is a lack of studies discussing the role of wearables in omnichannel hospital supply chain management and examining the influence of those above concerns on healthcare wearables adoption. Therefore, this study explores these gaps through an integrated approach. Furthermore, we proposed a framework integrating the traditional statistical and machine learning-based approach to analyze a large amount of data; and thereby facilitate a data-driven analytic model to manage omnichannel healthcare supply chain businesses.The advancement in technology has fostered the prevalence of the Internet of Things (IoT), which enhances healthcare business quality, offers a seamless customer experience, and maximizes turnovers and profits.

        <p>The emergence of digitalization and the Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed healthcare businesses and their operations. The traditional healthcare business model has shifted toward a more comprehensive focus on how healthcare providers and patients co-construct wellness and health value, driving a new omnichannel communication platform that increases information access to patients and empowers their decision-making (Dahl et al., 2021;El-Masri et al., 2022). In fact, consumer-centric and information-rich healthcare have been proposed and strongly recommended by the Health Information Technology Framework (Thompson and Brailer, 2004). A new era of healthcare defined by a patient-centric culture is on the horizon. The omnichannel strategy could align patient journeys with care plans, improve patients' experiences, optimize the clinical process and eliminate former inefficiencies by using innovative technology and data-driven analytics. By doing so, patients better understand their health and the physicians' advice by integrating information from many sources. In many ways, advancing and integrating omnichannel resources have become fundamental valuable co-creation components in healthcare services delivery (Dahl et al., 2018).The emergence of digitalization and the Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed healthcare businesses and their operations.

        <p>Digital health involves engaging patients for clinical purposes, such as collecting, organizing, interpreting, and using clinical medical data and managing results (AMA report). The digitalization advantages have presented an unprecedented chance for patients to have a wider range and more mindful healthcare choices. Therefore, to improve healthcare quality and reduce costs, patients' greater access and engagement with digital information are crucial factors (Chérrez-Ojeda et al., 2018). The tools used in digital health include digital health information inquiring, electronic medical records, patient portals, mobile health, telemedicine, healthcare wearables, and other remote monitoring appliances. Particularly, COVID-19 has accelerated digital health and fitness application growth by integrating data science and intelligence technology into traditional healthcare.Digital health involves engaging patients for clinical purposes, such as collecting, organizing, interpreting, and using clinical medical data and managing results (AMA report).

        <p>Healthcare wearable devices, namely wearables, are emerging as a salient tool to track and manage individuals' health and provide more in-depth information about their behavior, guidance, and health information. It plays an essential role in omnichannel strategy in the new age's healthcare sector (Montgomery et al., 2018). Wearable technology also allows healthcare businesses to continuously improve their competitiveness and responsiveness and adapt their omnichannel operational approaches and technologies to real-time data (Ogbuke et al., 2022). Wearables range from daily fitness activity trackers such as Fitbit to more advanced medical technology managing and preventing disease. Indeed, the recent breakthrough in wearable technology is expected to fuel the transformation in the health paradigm towards virtual and voluntary follow-up and diagnosis of sicknesses at home. Patients also acknowledge that a key benefit of healthcare wearables is that it offers healthcare service providers the opportunity to monitor and communicate with them anytime and anywhere and helps patients engage more in health service interactions. Besides, driven by the scarcity of medical resources, many wearables such as VitalPatch have been officially permitted by the United States Food and Drug Administration to facilitate remote patients' care and monitoring in the health sector (FDA, 2020).Healthcare wearable devices, namely wearables, are emerging as a salient tool to track and manage individuals' health and provide more in-depth information about their behavior, guidance, and health information.

        <p>Despite promising results of wearables in an omnichannel strategy for the healthcare business, notable research gaps exist in the literature. First, like other emerging technology, ethical issues are long-lasting topics but usually neglected. Although wearable devices allow omnichannel healthcare supply chain businesses to communicate with patients seamlessly, such devices expose many risks associated with their sensors and omnipresent data collection and storage. Remarkably, the acquisition of Google's Fitbit raised a question of concerns to public users about data privacy (Bourreau et al., 2020). At the same time, the privacy of healthcare wearables has received more attention, while the other associated ethical issues were underestimated. These issues are the barriers to wearables in omnichannel supply chain collaboration. Hence, a literature search and investigation of ethical matters related to wearables was performed to comprehensively understand the ethical facets of using healthcare wearables in previous research (Bourreau et al., 2020). The study aims to create awareness of the current ethical implications of wearables users in the health sector, supporting omnichannel supply chain management.Despite promising results of wearables in an omnichannel strategy for the healthcare business, notable research gaps exist in the literature.

        <p>Another barrier to healthcare wearables in the omnichannel strategy is patients' adoption, which has been emphasized as a lack of investigation and needs to be addressed for usage studies of future wearables (Sinha and Gupta, 2019). Significantly, the actual usage of wearables has not been completely elucidated (Chandrasekaran et al., 2020). Exploring and accessing this matter will drive healthcare wearables' growth and assure its prosperity in commercialization and popularity. Moreover, the increase in wearables adoption by patients will facilitate patient-hospital real-time interaction, which improves patient satisfaction, hospital resources allocation and supply chain collaboration. Some studies have investigated the driving forces of wearables' adoption in healthcare from the technological aspects (Farivar et al., 2020) or health-related aspects (Zhang et al., 2017). There is thus an opportunity to establish key determinants that describe patients' attitudes towards wearables, particularly as they relate to the healthcare decision-making process. Besides, other challenges, particularly ethical implications, remain a little-known area. Heretofore, only a little research explored ethical concerns such as privacy influence on wearables' adoption (Li et al., 2016), especially in the omnichannel environment where technology such as wearables is the key driver of success. Hence, this study addresses to fill this gap by examining the actual usage of wearables and their predictors in healthcare, such as demographics, privacy and security concerns, technological and health-related factors.Another barrier to healthcare wearables in the omnichannel strategy is patients' adoption, which has been emphasized as a lack of investigation and needs to be addressed for usage studies of future wearables (Sinha and Gupta, 2019).

        <p>An integrated-methods approach is opted to understand the ethical concerns and factors involved in using wearables in healthcare. It gives an overview of contemporary ethical issues and aggregates qualitative and quantitative findings from privacy and security concerns and their impact on the usage of smart wearables. First, a qualitative review of the studies on healthcare wearables' ethical concerns is performed to create a frame for the subsequent steps in the analysis. Next, the quantitative Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS, 2021) data are used to magnify understanding by examining the influence of ethical concerns and other predictors on the use of wearable devices in the omnichannel healthcare model. An integrated-method strategy supports the aim of this study to provide in-depth insights into the contemporary ethical issues in the literature while investigating the potential factors that affect the use of wearables in healthcare from the survey results. The research questions are (i) What are the ethical implications for using healthcare wearables in the omnichannel healthcare supply chain business, and which one is the most critical identified ethical concern in the extant literature?

        <p>While research shows that patients have increasingly used healthcare wearables to interact with omnichannel environments to enhance ones' experiences (Chen et al., 2018), current research lacks investigation of the wearables' roles and their predictors and implications. Thereby, our contribution is fourfold. First, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first time healthcare wearables' roles in the omnichannel healthcare supply chain business are discussed. A framework to utilize wearables and IoT to enhance patients' experience and engagement is proposed. Second, this paper systematically reviews the ethical concern of wearable devices in the healthcare sector and summarize these ethical challenges. Next, wearables' actual usage in healthcare, a relatively unexplored topic, is investigated in this study using US national survey data. We apply a data-driven model, machine learning in big data analytics (BDA), to predict wearables adoption and demonstrate how this approach could enhance supply chain management. Finally, the impact of privacy and security concerns, which are the most discussed ethical concerns in literature and the current challenge in omnichannel strategy, are highlighted and examined.While research shows that patients have increasingly used healthcare wearables to interact with omnichannel environments to enhance ones' experiences (Chen et al., 2018), current research lacks investigation of the wearables' roles and their predictors and implications.

        <p>Digitalization has been defined as the sociotechnical phenomena and processes used by individuals, organizations, and society to adopt and use digital technologies (Frenzel et al., 2021). It has fundamentally transformed our society in the last decades. Although digitalization has been developed for decades, the current wave is very different because consumers and citizens expect more digital services and products, particularly real-time services, which have influenced almost all private and personal aspects. The growth of digital technologies means digitalization invades our social-cultural world (Royakkers et al., 2018). For example, plagiarism of healthcare wearables has become easier due to the ease of data access (Wibawa et al., 2021). Moreover, using healthcare wearables to find a date and shopping also produces a wide variety of personal and private data. Those big data will raise some ethical concerns (Karatas et al., 2022). For example, privacy issues and digital security are the most of the public and political focus up to date. In particular, the way of storage and management of big data generated by healthcare wearables has become a hot topic because highly sensitive data reflects the health of the general public. How those ethical concerns influence the adoption and use of healthcare wearables are still less studied.Digitalization has been defined as the sociotechnical phenomena and processes used by individuals, organizations, and society to adopt and use digital technologies (Frenzel et al., 2021).

        <p>Digitization can facilitate the omnichannel business from the improvement of omnichannel retail (Ishfaq et al., 2022). Omnichannel retail allows consumers to access the whole available shopping channels, such as mobile internet devices, computers, in-store, and television (Min, 2021). Consumers can playfully adopt healthcare wearable devices by comparing products in all different available retail channels and tracking order deliveries in time through digitalized product flows if they purchased a product from the online platform. At the same time, retailers can also effectively deal with fulfillment processes via analyzing big data collected from different fulfillment nodes (Gibson et al., 2018).Digitization can facilitate the omnichannel business from the improvement of omnichannel retail (Ishfaq et al., 2022).

        <p>Digitization is not only a contemporary strategy to integrate with physical and online retail worlds but also results in social norms of supply chain management (Ishfaq et al., 2022). Retail enterprises can coinnovate with digital platforms to create value. For example, Swedish company, Rapunzel, lowered its risks and costs by leveraging Amazon's platform to reach consumers around the world (Mostaghel et al., 2022). Online consumer reviews are a dominant factor in influencing consumers' adoption of digital business, and it is also crucial to impact retail firms' external interactions with their consumers. For example, digitization makes healthcare wearables collect a massive amount of data, containing health-related information and sensitive personal data possible, and spread it via social networks to create social norms in time. This may cause concerns about confidentiality and data privacy, as well as other ethical concerns due to data leaks from those social media. On the other hand, exposed social norms may boost omnichannel business from positive social norms.Digitization is not only a contemporary strategy to integrate with physical and online retail worlds but also results in social norms of supply chain management (Ishfaq et al., 2022).

        <p>The fourth industrial revolution, or Industry 4.0, has transformed healthcare to extraordinary levels on the basis of digitization, AI and other disruptive technologies. For instance, AI has helped healthcare customers to enhance operational practice through user knowledge and to achieve better care and improve the patient journey (Leone et al., 2021). However, it also leads to an exploding data generation (Guha and Kumar, 2018). In fact, the amount of data collected from healthcare is growing exponentially, and information insights have become the key drivers of healthcare system success (Kraus et al., 2021). The more information is obtained, the more optimally and effectively the decision can be made. Also, based on the predictive model, the trends and patterns can be uncovered. However, at the same time, tons of data from every aspect of our lives are collected, stored, and managed. The volume of data now becomes large and unmanageable, especially for traditional applications. More precious information and trending insights can be gained quickly and cost-efficiently with advanced AI technology and machine learning (ML) (Huang and Rust, 2021).The fourth industrial revolution, or Industry 4.0, has transformed healthcare to extraordinary levels on the basis of digitization, AI and other disruptive technologies.

        <p>Particularly in the healthcare system, a massive number of data in various forms such as clinical data, genomic data, patient's medical history, and other personal medical data need to be managed and processed. Therefore, medical data are complex and predicting models for diagnosis and prognosis are very significant for patients' treatment.Particularly in the healthcare system, a massive number of data in various forms such as clinical data, genomic data, patient's medical history, and other personal medical data need to be managed and processed.

        <p>There is a need to propose efficient methods and tools to analyze big medical data, especially the growing precision and personalized medicine for illness treatment. Numerous research projects have been conducted to evaluate AI and ML's clinical decision-making and support (Buchlak et al., 2020). Numerous AI and ML applications, such as imageguided medical aid, computer-aided diagnosis, multimodal image fusion, and so on, are available to clinicians and support them in making clinical decisions through past data. Numerous research projects have ML also resolved to reduce healthcare costs and improve patientclinician communication (Shailaja et al., 2018). AI can automate healthcare administrative systems and optimize the current process, including managing patients' records and appointments. Healthcare management can also utilize techniques to forecast inpatients' waiting times and places in the relevant department to manage hospital resources effectively (Ordu et al., 2021). Besides, the healthcare provider can use the prognostic model to estimate hospital room admissions. Thus, ML deployment could benefit patients by reducing price, enhancing accurate diagnosis rate, or diffusing experience.There is a need to propose efficient methods and tools to analyze big medical data, especially the growing precision and personalized medicine for illness treatment.

        <p>With the increasing growth in digitization and IoT applications, consumers can communicate and interact with firms across different channels such as mobile, online, and offline. It has shifted toward an omnichannel environment, emphasizing a unified consumer experience rather than simply promoting transactions. Omnichannel business rs to a strategy that operates in diverse physical and online channels with a synergistic integration to offer customers a seamless and uninterrupted shopping journey (Lynch &amp; Barnes, 2020). It also indicates the implementation of different channels to interact with customers precisely due to a unified operation, where customers can interact with the business seamlessly. In other words, an omnichannel environment is an integrated strategy where customers can seek information and purchase through various channels simultaneously (Min, 2021). Past research has shown that this perfect integration across channels could promote customer experiences and business performance (Mirzabeiki &amp; Saghiri, 2020;Bijmolt et al., 2021).With the increasing growth in digitization and IoT applications, consumers can communicate and interact with firms across different channels such as mobile, online, and offline.

        <p>In the healthcare context, omnichannel strategy can be defined as integrating and coordinating a healthcare service provider's actions across different healthcare delivery and communication channels and patient touchpoints that offer patients a seamless journey (Varadarajan et al., 2021). The omnichannel approach can assist in restructuring healthcare providers' current workflow involving onsite patient appointments, back-office tasks, triage nurses, and patient medical records management. Optimizing the patient administration process is an excellent example of an efficient and interactive workflow in the healthcare omnichannel environment (Reuveni, 2017). A patient can make an appointment, get billing, and confirm insurance eligibility either by pre-check-in via online portals or self-service kiosks. By integrating different online and physical channels, the patient has more choice and flexibility in booking; hence, the patient's experience and satisfaction when using healthcare services are improved. Besides, this flexible and self-service-oriented procedure will gradually replace and reduce the necessity for clinic receptionist support, thereby cutting patients' waiting times and costs.In the healthcare context, omnichannel strategy can be defined as integrating and coordinating a healthcare service provider's actions across different healthcare delivery and communication channels and patient touchpoints that offer patients a seamless journey (Varadarajan et al., 2021).

        <p>Healthcare businesses are beginning to understand the critical role of omnichannel. Nevertheless, getting there and effectively implementing the services is unexpectedly tricky. Azoev et al. (2019) found that the precise incorporation of digital channels into an omnichannel environment might delete clients' boundaries, drive business growth, and allow businesses to apply their digital skillset to avail their traditional channels. Engaging patients via various digital and interpersonal touchpoints will benefit healthcare providers and patients. Improved access and integration to health information also initiate higher involvement and conscious reflection about their health choices (Dahl et al., 2019), leading to enhanced health-related outcomes and patient experiences (Dahl et al., 2018). Although there are several benefits of an omnichannel strategy providing healthcare businesses, such as promoting innovation, driving growth, and improving long-term performance, some challenges prevent this strategy from achieving its full potential. Consequently, ascertaining how to embrace an omnichannel strategy while respecting the privacy of customers is a significant challenge for healthcare businesses.Healthcare businesses are beginning to understand the critical role of omnichannel.

        <p>Wearables refer to smart electronic devices worn on a user's body, such as the arm (e.g., fitness trackers), head (e.g., smart helmets), or wrist (e.g., smartwatches), to measure, analyze, and transmit information (Tavakoli et al., 2020;El-Masri, Al-Yafi, &amp; Kamal, 2022). They are widely used in healthcare to measure vital signs, such as heart rate, body temperature, and blood pressure, or to monitor physical activities. Typical wearables will obtain health information from users through a sensor, then send data to mobile or computer applications and clouds to store and analyze data via Bluetooth. By integrating intelligent technology, wearables can be used to access real-time information and recommendation, detect and analyze movement or disease based on human physiological and pathological information (Guk et al., 2019). Wearables are a part of the IoT that facilitates the healthcare system and provides technical support to keep track of patients' health, implement clinical tests, and assist medication judgment. Wearables present an opportunity to create a more seamless healthcare experience and involve long-term condition patient management. Consequently, many medical conditions are treatments would benefit from adopting wearable devices.Wearables refer to smart electronic devices worn on a user's body, such as the arm (e.g., fitness trackers), head (e.g., smart helmets), or wrist (e.g., smartwatches), to measure, analyze, and transmit information (Tavakoli et al., 2020;El-Masri, Al-Yafi, &amp; Kamal, 2022).

        <p>The intelligent technology in wearables is continuously investigated and improved to facilitate the emergence of connected healthcare. The increasing usage of wearables in our daily lives and healthcare systems will generate enormous and different data sources, eventually increasing the need for improved digital health records and a data-driven medical knowledge base. Along with this growing trend, there are more worries about ethical issues such as data privacy and security when using these devices (Azodo et al., 2020;Martinez-Martin et al., 2021;Thakare et al., 2022).The intelligent technology in wearables is continuously investigated and improved to facilitate the emergence of connected healthcare.

        <p>More research about ethical concerns has been studied about wearables in healthcare. As stated above, the popularity of wearables leads to more concern about the dark side of these devices about hidden harmful impacts. As the advantages of healthcare wearables have been taken more concentration while their ethical concerns were neglected, a systematic review of ethical risks of using wearables was presented in this part to introduce what ethical issues were discussed in the prior studies. This qualitative analysis identifies and synthesizes literature conclusions to explore a research question and make results more accessible to practitioners and researchers. In particular, the literature search and investigation are implemented to determine the associated ethical implication of wearables and their current state in the health sector. Our study follows the PRISMA methodological framework for literature search and investigation (Page et al., 2021). Many criteria for exclusion and inclusion are applied to determine articles as follows (e.g., see Appendix C).More research about ethical concerns has been studied about wearables in healthcare.

        <p>Heretofore, many different ethical issues have been discussed in the literature, such as privacy (Segura Anaya et al., 2018), security (Cilliers, 2020), informed consent (Allhoff and Henschke, 2018;Martinez-Martin et al., 2021), and trust (Bourreau et al., 2020). Such issues have become extremely challenging in the omnichannel healthcare supply chain business, where the development of IoT and wearable devices are the key concepts driving on-demand and remote healthcare services (Shah andChircu, 2018, Hermes et al., 2020). Previous work has raised concerns about data collected through wearables, especially inaccurate data and false reports due to sharing devices with another person or security issues in data transmission (Sharon, 2016). Besides, the personalized medicine and treatment offered by wearables may significantly rely on AI modeling of the patient and types of disease, which may have falsealarm and false negative cases. Moreover, the aging population and poor access to technology are other ethical challenges in adopting healthcare wearables (Howard, 2021). As there are several associated ethical issues, this section describes the two most prevalent concernsprivacy and security, which are also one of the main driving forces of using wearables and will be investigated further in the following quantitative study in this paper.Heretofore, many different ethical issues have been discussed in the literature, such as privacy (Segura Anaya et al., 2018), security (Cilliers, 2020), informed consent (Allhoff and Henschke, 2018;Martinez-Martin et al., 2021), and trust (Bourreau et al., 2020).

As there are several associated ethical issues, this section describes the two most prevalent concernsprivacy and security, which are also one of the main driving forces of using wearables and will be investigated further in the following quantitative study in this paper.</p>
        <p>First, the main challenge for wearables adoption is the privacy of sharing information model. Wearables can collect a massive amount of data, containing health-related information and sensitive personal data, spreading to others using social networks, threatening confidentiality and data privacy (Segura Anaya et al., 2018). Second, another privacy issue is that the wearables company does not disclose the information they collected about users and allows users to choose which information to record and access (Cilliers, 2020). For example, once wearables have been integrated into users' daily lives, their personal information, such as preference and geographical location, is recorded and analyzed by others. Third, collecting and storing unnecessary data become a crucial privacy concern, mainly when users are unclear about purposes and which parties can access the stored data. According to a study about the emergency department (ED), although wearables could be a solution to reduce crowding, clinician privacy concerns are the top challenges in adopting this technology in ED (Castner and Suffoletto, 2018).First, the main challenge for wearables adoption is the privacy of sharing information model.

        <p>In theory, keeping the collected data private should be encrypted and made physically secure. Hence, the second ethical concern while using these devices is related to data security. In many cases, stored data on the local device lack proper encryption, such as no user authentication and compulsory password safeguard (Jurcut et al., 2020). Besides, to allow the flexibility and support of wearables, many different mobile sources could connect to the devices, enhancing the threat of tampering and leakage. Additionally, the data transmission is usually by shortrange technology like near-field communication (NFC) or Bluetooth, making it more vulnerable to cybersecurity risks of external attacks (Babun et al., 2021). Security is also a prominent concern for healthcare facilities, which need reliability at all operation levels. However, many security matters of wearables have been reported. According to the literature, the devices had several vulnerabilities, including an insecure firmware and cloud interface, insufficient authorization, and lack of transport encryption, which could most likely lead to unauthorized viewing, copying, transferring, and even stealing of personal data (Slepchuk et al., 2022).In theory, keeping the collected data private should be encrypted and made physically secure.

        <p>Therefore, as the concerns about ethical matters while using wearables are gaining more public attention, it is important to identify their relevant ethical implications, especially for the healthcare sector. Based on the above discussions, this study proposes the first hypothesis: H1: Individual concerns about data privacy and security will be negatively related to the use of healthcare wearables.Therefore, as the concerns about ethical matters while using wearables are gaining more public attention, it is important to identify their relevant ethical implications, especially for the healthcare sector.

        <p>The increasing desire from consumers to monitor their health has dramatically affected wearables growth in the healthcare sector. Besides privacy and security concerns, many determinants influenced the spread of healthcare wearables, including demographics, technology selfefficacy, health-related variables, and physical activities. Demographics such as age, gender, and education have been observed to affect consumers' adoption. However, prior studies regularly underestimate these variables and treat them as control variables, not in the main framework. Nonetheless, wearables literature has shown that higher educated, younger, and wealthier people are more likely to adopt healthcare wearable devices (Chandrasekaran et al., 2020). Besides, males tend to use these intelligent devices more than females based on observations (Wiesner et al., 2018). Jiang et al. (2017) andHa andPark (2020) also tested the impact of marital status on the intention to use mobile health applications on cancer survivors and older Korean adults, respectively. The marital status showed significance in the work of Jiang et al. (2017) while insignificant in the work of Ha and Park (2020). Mitchell et al. (2019) examined whether the use of technology to manage health among older people varies by race/ethnicity and concluded differences between whites, older blacks and Hispanics. As a result, following the prior literature, this study explores their demographic effects on using wearable devices and makes the following hypotheses:The increasing desire from consumers to monitor their health has dramatically affected wearables growth in the healthcare sector.

        <p>There is a growing concern from the public about personal healthcare management. Remarkably, the emergence of wearables in healthcare allows medical providers to track patients' health outside the hospital, which is extremely helpful for care plans and chronic illness management. Moreover, one of the crucial functions of healthcare wearables products is checking and monitoring health status (Zhang et al., 2017). Consequently, it appears as a prominent means to control chronic conditions and monitor physical activities. Hence, more and more consumers are using wearables for positive health improvement. Furthermore, physical activities are strongly associated with healthcare wearables because doing exercises could improve both individuals' health (Xie et al., 2020). Consequently, physical activities and healthrelated variables such as general health conditions and the presence of chronic disease are essential constructs to predict the use of wearables. Therefore, we propose the eighth hypothesis as follows:There is a growing concern from the public about personal healthcare management.

        <p>The younger age group is more susceptible to technological advances and tends to adopt these devices. Technology self-efficacy, an individual's belief in doing a technological task as their intention, has been studied to determine the levels of technology adoption from consumers. Apparently, this concept should be unquestionably important in predicting wearables use. However, Lee and Lee (2018) revealed that this construct did not impact wearable health tracker choice. In contrast, according to qualitative research by Abouzahra and Ghasemaghaei (2020), self-efficacy toward technology was found as an influencer on the choice and confidence levels to adopt wearables. Accordingly, this construct will be examined in this study as its empirical findings are still conflicting. As a result, we propose the following ninth hypothesis as follows:The younger age group is more susceptible to technological advances and tends to adopt these devices.

        <p>Despite the enormous benefits that users derive from the IoT, there are challenges that come with it that need attention, particularly data privacy and security. On the one hand, these two issues pose a huge dilemma for many businesses, organizations as well as public organizations (Tawalbeh et al., 2020;Deep et al., 2022). On the other hand, because of the privacy and security issues previously encountered in the use of IoT products, concerns about this issue are greatly increased before using other emerging technology products, thus hindering the acceptance of these innovative products (Merhi et al., 2019). While using wearable devices, users usually contribute their health and private data to a centralized cloud database managed by wearable organizations. As discussed in the above section, wearables users are consequently exposed to privacy and cybersecurity risks, such as unauthorized access and external attacks. In fact, data protection and security remained the obstacles limiting the use of wearable devices (Deloitte, 2015). Besides, Marakhimov and Joo (2017) unearthed that privacy profoundly affects healthcare wearables adoption. Consumers are increasingly worried about privacy and security issues while using these devices. According to Li et al. (2016), consumers will decide to adopt wearables if the benefits outweigh the losses from privacy and security. Therefore, they will judge the benefits and risks of wearables to decide whether they should continue using the devices. This study also explores the effect of privacy and security concerns on using wearable devices and makes the following hypothesis:Fig. 1.Despite the enormous benefits that users derive from the IoT, there are challenges that come with it that need attention, particularly data privacy and security.

        <p>First of all, this study searches and investigates the literature in the healthcare domain and about the use of wearables and related concerns and the application of AI in the healthcare domain. Through the literature search and investigation, we identify the most discussed concerns and construct the model by defining the concerns as independent variables and the use of healthcare wearables as the dependent variable. The results of the literature review are presented in Section 2, and the proposed model is presented in Fig. 3. Some of them are latent variables. The dataset employed comes from Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) by the National Cancer Institute. In the next step, based on the concerns identified in the process of literature search and investigation, the questions in the HINTS that measure these concerns are selected, and the corresponding attributes and data are collected. The attributes are employed as constructs to reflect latent or independent variables. The complete proposed model is shown in Fig. 3. In addition, we clean the data by checking duplicated, missing, error, or inapplicable values. In the next step, the exploratory data analysis is conducted to study the demographic characteristics of respondents, the construct distribution and the correlation of the constructs. The PLS-SEM with 
            <rs type="software">SmartPLS</rs>
            <rs type="version">3.0</rs> is used to analyze the impact of the concerns and demographics on the use of healthcare wearables. In the fifth step, the scale accuracy analysis is performed to evaluate the reliability and validity of the measurement model. We evaluate the reliability using Cronbach's alpha, composite reliability (CR), and AVE, and the validity using the Fornell-Larcker criterion and heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) ratio. After that, the structural model assessment is conducted to explore the relationship between the use of healthcare wearables and its antecedents and identify the significant antecedents. Finally, machine learning algorithms are performed to predict healthcare wearables users. The results of feature importance are used to validate the result of the structural model assessment.

Hence, we dropped 284 articles due to their ineligibility for the review scope. After reviewing the title and abstract, only 79 records met the inclusion criteria. These documents were then labeled with the primary categories: consent, reliability, privacy and security, safety, and others.The search indicated 368 initially relevant articles, as depicted in Fig. C1 (Appendix C).

        <p>Fig. 5 illustrates the number of chosen articles and keywords ethical categories reported by year based on the articles generated. A growing drift in the number of research in wearables' ethics for the healthcare domain is observed except for 2018. A similar trend is seen in the number of privacy and security studies. In comparison, most research examines privacy and security matters, and other issues such as consent, reliability, and safety issues were followed. The ethical concept frequency of the selected studies is presented in the word cloud, in which font sizes indicate the frequency number of the corresponding concept. Furthermore, the text analysis by a word cloud chart is depicted in Fig. 6. As can be seen in the chart, privacy, security, and consent are the top three ethical concerns while using healthcare wearable devices. In addition, reliability, safety, confidentiality, and authenticity are other ethical matters discussed in the prior research. Besides, data management and governance are also gained attention in related literature. A network chart in Fig. 7 shows how the concepts in selected records are interrelated. The visual signifies that the central ethical issue in prior literature is privacy and security connected to other topics such as authentication, confidentiality, trust, and reliability. Further, an overview of top ethical concerns is discussed herein.Fig. 5 illustrates the number of chosen articles and keywords ethical categories reported by year based on the articles generated.

        <p>• Privacy concern was among the most frequently mentioned in our literature search for ethical issues in healthcare wearables. The literature mainly discussed data misuses, such as data anonymization and the individual information transfer outside devices' scope for this topic. Dave and Gupta (2020) emphasized the above issues for COVID-19 proximity tracking wearables cases. Besides, Monteith et al. (2021) presented that numerous wearables users may not violate their privacy. The reason is that the "surveillance capital" business model in many intelligent deviceswhere providers offer some free services but enable them to monitor the users' behaviors of those usersoften without their explicit consent. Privacy policies, which generally comprise the ownership and purpose of using all data acquired, are usually available online. Consequently, massive personal information is collected from wearables, which can be consolidated, analyzed, and packaged to sell to other businesses to profit. • Healthcare wearables can collect user health and private information, which may enhance tampering and leakage risks. Giansanti (2021) found that healthcare wearables were typically involved in a possibly susceptible to cyberattacks heterogeneous system where its components communicated through wireless. Hackers could then intentionally transmit unreliable data to the control system if the wireless connection is potentially unsafe. Therefore, approaches to assure data security from wearables and gain confidence from the public are needed.• Privacy concern was among the most frequently mentioned in our literature search for ethical issues in healthcare wearables.

        <p>To investigate data, we used descriptive and crosstab tables. The final data included 2,687 US adult respondents aged 18 years or older, in which 53.37 % were female, 77.00 % had college or more, 59.77 % were non-Hispanic white. The Wald chi-square test results from Table showed significant differences between users and non-users of wearables in healthcare across different demographic segments. Among the reported respondents, 25.87 % used healthcare wearables in the past months, in which non-Hispanic white ones (16.41 %), female (15.41 %), married ones (14.40 %), graduated college and higher education ones (14.25 %), and ones had annual incomes higher than US$ 75,000 (13.73 %) were most likely adopting healthcare wearables. Fig. 8 shows the distribution of other independent variables in this study. As can be seen from the chart, more than half of the participants had chronic conditions, while more than two-thirds reported having good to very good general health. Moreover, nearly-two-thirds of them did not use tablets or mobile devices to support keeping track of health information, and only 13.44 % of them shared health information from the devices with their health providers.To investigate data, we used descriptive and crosstab tables.

        <p>We conducted the measurement model assessment following Hair et al. (2019)'s guidance for handling the PLS-SEM procedure to ensure every indicator was reliable and valid. First, Table 3 indicated no indicator loaded less than the minimum threshold value of 0.4. For the indicators with the loading factor from 0.4 to 0.7, we evaluated the average variance extracted (AVE) value to decide whether drop these indicators. As shown in Table 3, all constructs' AVE was higher than 0.5, which met the requirements for strengthening the content validity (Hair et al., 2017). Therefore, no indicators were required to drop in this case. Then, we accessed the scale reliability using Cronbach's alpha, composite reliability (CR), and AVE. Our results showed that all the above measures were acceptable values of 0.6, 0.7, 0.5 for Cronbach's alpha, CR, and AVE, respectively (Ursachi, Horodnic, and Zait, 2015;Hair et al., 2017). Therefore, the assessment results indicated that the convergent validity and reliability requirements were met, which meant our framework indicators could demonstrate consistency and explain variables.We conducted the measurement model assessment following Hair et al.

        <p>Next, the Fornell-Larcker criterion and heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) ratio were examined to verify discriminant validity. HTMT ratio was found as a novel method to overcome the previous traditional approach limitation (Henseler et al., 2015). According to Table 4, the AVE value's square root was higher for every variable than all the correlations between each pair of variables, indicating that discriminant validity requirements were satisfied. Moreover, as the rule of thumb, all constructs' HTMT ratio value was required to be &lt; 0.9 (Hair et al., 2017). From the analysis results in Table 4, all HTMT values satisfied this condition. Consequently, the results indicated rigid evidence of good discriminant validity for all constructs.Next, the Fornell-Larcker criterion and heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) ratio were examined to verify discriminant validity.

        <p>To avoid the common method bias (CMB) threatening the validity of our findings, we conducted Harman's single factor test to measure it (see Table 2). This method is realized using factor analysis and restricting the number of factors to 1. If the total variance for one factor is &lt; 50 %, the results are not affected by the CMB (Roni and Djajadikerta, 2021). In our Harman's single factor test, the total variance for a single factor is 18.428 %, indicating that our data and results are free from the CMB.To avoid the common method bias (CMB) threatening the validity of our findings, we conducted Harman's single factor test to measure it (see Table 2).

        <p>The structural model was accessed by bootstrapping 5,000 samples to compute the coefficient, 95 % confidence interval (CI), and the significance level with a threshold p-value of 0.05 to explore the antecedents of wearables use in healthcare (see Fig. 10). The quality of the structural model was investigated using the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) and predictive relevance (Q 2 ). The R 2 value of the dependent variable was 0.12, which signified the satisfied explanatory power of the model as the R 2 value was above the acceptable level of 0.1 (Mochales and Blanch, 2022;Galindo-Martín et al., 2021;Falk and Miller, 1992). In addition, the Q 2 values of all endogenous variables were higher than 0, indicating that the model has predictive relevance. Therefore, a satisfactory model for the proposed framework was concluded with these above findings.The structural model was accessed by bootstrapping 5,000 samples to compute the coefficient, 95 % confidence interval (CI), and the significance level with a threshold p-value of 0.05 to explore the antecedents of wearables use in healthcare (see Fig. 10).

        <p>Next, the outcomes were examined and displayed in Table 5. Except for Education, Privacy and Security Concerns, and Race, the framework's remaining relationships were significant, with p-values&lt;0.05. Particularly, the Age (p &lt; 0.001), BirthGender (p &lt; 0.001), Healthrelated (p = 0.003), Income (p &lt; 0.000), MaritalStatus (p = 0.022), and Technology-related (p &lt; 0.001) values were significant with the confident level of 95 %, indicating they have a significant impact on the usage of wearable devices in the healthcare domain. Among them, the influences of Age (β = 0.093), Health-related (β = 0.056), and Mar-italStatus (β = 0.046) were positive, while those of BirthGender (β = -0.077), income (β = -0.125) and Technology-related (β = -0.207) were negative. Moreover, the Technology-related variable had a significant positive impact on Privacy and Security Concerns (β = 0.043, p = 0.033 &lt; 0.05). However, the results also indicated that the influences of Education, Privacy, and Security Concerns, and Race on the use of wearable devices in the healthcare domain are insignificant, with p-values greater than 0.05. The findings suggested that age, gender, healthrelated factor, marital status, and technology-related factors were profoundly correlated with an increased possibility of using healthcare wearables. Other variables did not have significant effects on the use of wearables.Next, the outcomes were examined and displayed in Table 5.

        <p>The training and test performance results generated by classification reports of the three machine learning models are displayed in Table 6. The neural network showed the best results for both training and testing regarding accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The one exception is the gradient boosting algorithm matching its performance in training precision. Therefore, it can be concluded that neural networks outperform logistic regression and gradient boosting algorithms at predicting healthcare wearables users. Next, the top five important features from experiment 2 were visualized in Fig. 11 According to the chart, the features that hugely influenced wearables users' prediction were tablet support, exercise levels, age, income and weight. Consistent with the results in structural assessment, people who are more familiar with technology, especially those who have experienced using tablets, are the most critical contributor to predict wearables users (see Table 5).The training and test performance results generated by classification reports of the three machine learning models are displayed in Table 6.

        <p>Through an integrated-methods approach, we explore the role of wearables in the omnichannel healthcare supply chain business and the associated ethical challenges in this study. The wearable device appears as an inevitable tool to effectively manage the health business supply chain and facilitate omnichannel strategy because this emerging technology provides a solution to improve interaction and the co-valued relationship between hospitals and patients. Then, we investigate the influence of ethical issues (i.e., privacy and security concerns) and other predictors such as technology self-efficacy, health-related factors, and demographics on the use of wearables. Finally, recommendations and future research directions are proposed to promote the use of wearable devices in the omnichannel strategy of healthcare supply chain businesses.Through an integrated-methods approach, we explore the role of wearables in the omnichannel healthcare supply chain business and the associated ethical challenges in this study.

Wearables are a part of the IoT that facilitates the omnichannel healthcare system by providing technical support to monitor patients' health and implementing clinical tests remotely. It supports the transfer and exchange of information through omnichannel systems and provides real-time data about the health conditions and activities of patients. With the advancement of AI and big data analytics, omnichannel healthcare supply chain businesses could understand patients' physical condition, need, and wants. Consistent with Dahl et al.

        <p>Through the literature search and investigation, the omnichannel healthcare and wearable technology literature have highlighted the ethical implications of using these devices is a relatively understudied area in the healthcare domain. Our findings indicate that privacy and security are the most concerning ethical matters. These concerns are also the contemporary challenge in adopting an omnichannel approach (Cui et al., 2021). After that, we investigate the effect of these concerns on the adoption of healthcare wearables through a quantitative study. Surprisingly, privacy and security concerns do not affect healthcare wearables adoption. This finding implies a strong implication about the current awareness level about the privacy and security of wearables. One reason is that consumers do not have enough understanding of the loss of privacy and potential security matters involved with many tech companies in the US. Fruchter and Liccardi (2018) discovered that privacy and security concerns were mentioned in only 2 % of online reviews of IPA products. Williams, Nurse, and Creese (2019) highlighted that although 84 % of US consumers were worried about their data, they rarely safeguard their information in action. Other potential reasons include consumers trusting the company or government, or being satisfied with their existing data policies, and not feeling targeted (Zeng et al., 2017;Liao et al., 2019).Through the literature search and investigation, the omnichannel healthcare and wearable technology literature have highlighted the ethical implications of using these devices is a relatively understudied area in the healthcare domain.

        <p>In fact, many studies have found that privacy was not a consumers' primary objective; hence, they might lack the motivation to protect their personal data (Hughes-Roberts, 2015), including ignoring the permissions, accepting default settings without reading, skimming policies, and the growing trend of data exchange on social media. The proliferation of self-discloser on social media also intensifies the above issues and reduces the risk to consumers' privacy and security (Tsay-Vogel, Shanahan, and Signorielli, 2018). The threat to privacy and security and their safeguards should be escalated. More campaigns to raise awareness for consumers are needed. Besides, the government, the manufacturers, and the businesses should align to have a more trustworthy and transparent data protection framework. Rather than requiring compliance from the consumers, the empowering aspects of protection should be highlighted. Finally, our findings are consolidated through the integratedmethods approach and present the most comprehensive examination of the antecedents of actual wearables usage in healthcare with the support of advanced machine learning models. Our findings conclude that a significant portion of US adults reported using healthcare wearables. The results also suggest that gender, exercise levels, age, marriage, income, general health, and technology use are crucial factors. In particular, younger, healthier, and wealthier females are more likely to use wearable devices. Additionally, technology-related factors have a positive impact on privacy and security concerns. Then, we propose a predictive model to predict the wearables' usage by machine learning algorithms. It helps the wearables industry identify its potential customers based on national survey data and advancements in data science and AI technology. Neural network models show the best performance in predicting wearables users. The important features analysis of the predictive model reveals that people who have experienced using tablets are the most critical contributor to predict wearables users.In fact, many studies have found that privacy was not a consumers' primary objective; hence, they might lack the motivation to protect their personal data (Hughes-Roberts, 2015), including ignoring the permissions, accepting default settings without reading, skimming policies, and the growing trend of data exchange on social media.

First, our findings suggest that digitalization or promoting digital skills will equip citizens to use wearables more effectively. Furthermore, gender, age, income, and health conditions are other essential features of our predictive wearables users model. The healthcare and wearable business might benefit from the above information to identify the target groups of customers to advance the current function and design and expand sales and engagement.

The use of wearables will facilitate the omnichannel transformation of the healthcare sector, releasing hospital burdens, better-allocating resources, and effectively managing the supply chain.</p>
        <p>Second, omnichannel healthcare supply chain businesses and the opportunities for data collection from wearables require a rethink of sales, marketing, management and operational strategies to enhance insights into the patient journey and adapt to Industry 4.0. The amount of available data from healthcare is increasing exponentially; hence, BDA has become an essential part of strategic decision-making (Sivarajah et al., 2017). Particularly, BDA and related techniques, such as AI and machine learning, can significantly improve supply chain management (Guha and Kumar, 2018). Our work demonstrates how management and business researchers could use big data analytics to support decision-making. In our case, the algorithmic classification model could enable profiling and prediction based on age, gender, ethnicity, health condition, and other information on a large scale (Dash et al., 2019).Second, omnichannel healthcare supply chain businesses and the opportunities for data collection from wearables require a rethink of sales, marketing, management and operational strategies to enhance insights into the patient journey and adapt to Industry 4.0.

        <p>A plethora of research has highlighted the importance of understanding contemporary ethical concerns, especially the practices and substantial development of omnichannel healthcare supply chain businesses and the wearables industry. Our literature review unveiled that privacy and security concerns are the most frequently studied fields, followed by reliability, consent, and safety. However, our quantitative survey analysis findings indicate that the influence of privacy and security issues on wearables' adoption is not significant in a real-world situation. Hence, practitioners and policymakers need to reinforce their endeavors to enhance the technology deliveries and ethical framework to maintain the popularity of healthcare wearables in the omnichannel environment. From the above findings, the following recommendations have been made:A plethora of research has highlighted the importance of understanding contemporary ethical concerns, especially the practices and substantial development of omnichannel healthcare supply chain businesses and the wearables industry.

        <p>• First, more policies and practices should be made to increase knowledge of ethical matters associated with healthcare wearable devices to related parties and clarify each individual's rights and obligations. Consumers should be aware of privacy, give prudence consent while sharing their data, and increase technical knowledge to safeguard their information, such as updating antivirus software. Besides, the wearable devices business should take on more responsibilities rather than only manufacturing devices. Healthcare supply chain businesses have to be aware of patient privacy and security risk, and work with the wearables sector should establish oversight and formulate practices to shield users' data privacy and safety. In order to maintain a sustainable omnichannel environment, healthcare businesses should focus on managing risk and protecting users from vulnerability, attack, and misused data. • Second, the standardized procedures for regulating wearable devices should be escalated, particularly when integrating into the health sector. A more updated procedure and framework should approach contemporary ethical matters, including users' data privacy and the ethical improvement of wearable devices and not suppress their innovation, particularly in the health sector. Health providers and wearables businesses need to add more detailed guidelines for their products, which will benefit the consumers and both parties. Besides, this will assist consumers with more insight about wearables to mitigate the ethical risks and help prevent any potential future legal problems for providers. Another example is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) framework regulating concise consent, avoiding data misuse, and strengthening data privacy. However, as digital data keeps growing, it is crucial to frequently research, improve, and update the GDPR and related frameworks to deal with any ethical issues promptly.• First, more policies and practices should be made to increase knowledge of ethical matters associated with healthcare wearable devices to related parties and clarify each individual's rights and obligations.

        <p>This study examines the current ethical issues and their influence and other factors on wearables' adoption among US adults. The framework can be applied to different contexts such as sports and fitness (Kim and Chiu, 2019) or to other countries to reproduce and expand the outcomes relied on in this study's conclusions. Ethical concerns about using wearables in the prior literature are also analyzed and emphasized in this investigation; however, further study and extension are expected to increase their privacy and security levels. Moreover, the review reveals associated ethical concerns in literature, including privacy and security concerns, data reliability, consent, and authenticity, while current quantitative design surveys examine privacy and security concerns. Future work can explore the influence of other ethical issues, such as data reliability and authenticity, on the use of wearables in healthcare. Besides, privacy and security concerns are accessed in the quantitative survey under a binary question (yes or no); in reality, people might have different degrees of those concerns, consequently impacting wearables adoption. Therefore, future work should conduct an empirical study to investigate different extents of the concerns.This study examines the current ethical issues and their influence and other factors on wearables' adoption among US adults.

        <p>The authors also offer some suggestions for future research in the field of healthcare operations. Firstly, future research could utilize IoT and BDA to give patients the option of networking their wearable devices with the healthcare system. Connected healthcare enables doctors to monitor a patient's basic physical condition and provide care even when the patient is not in the hospital, which maybe particularly convenient and cost-effective for patients with chronic conditions. Moreover, as ML algorithms have been studied in-depth, their predictive power has been significantly improved in various fields, including healthcare. On this basis, precision medicine has the potential to be achieved through the introduction of these intelligent technologies into the healthcare system. By analyzing the vast amount of medical data in the healthcare system that cannot be processed by the human brain, precision medicine may be able to provide effective advice to doctors. However, future research on this topic will need to pay attention to the ethical issues involved, such as patient privacy or the right to choose to use precision medicine technology. The systematic review methodology is implemented to determine the associated ethical implication of wearables and their current state in the health sector.

        <p>The Logistic Regression (LR) Classifier is a widely used algorithm for classification problems in machine learning because of its training efficiency and highly accurate results. It is an algorithm to classify the data as discrete outcomes. Also, in healthcare research, it is popularly applied and found to have good performances (Goodfellow, McDaniel, &amp; Papernot, 2018). LR applies a logistic function, also known as a sigmoid function (σ), to predict values and maps values to the probability from 0 to 1 (Dreiseitl &amp; Ohno-Machado, 2002) as the below formula:The Logistic Regression (LR) Classifier is a widely used algorithm for classification problems in machine learning because of its training efficiency and highly accurate results.

        <p>Gradient Boosting Classifier is an ensemble algorithm that combined many weak learning models to create a robust predictive one. In other words, it takes a sequential strategy to obtain predictions where each decision tree predicts the error of the previous one and eventually improves the gradient (error) (Ayyadevara, 2018). This technique is referred to as stochastic gradient boosting using an iterative method to develop a final model in a forward stage-wise fashion, progressively adding trees to the model. It is emerging and has become famous because of its effectiveness in complicated datasets classification (Goodfellow, McDaniel, &amp; Papernot, 2018) (Figs. B1 and B2).Gradient Boosting Classifier is an ensemble algorithm that combined many weak learning models to create a robust predictive one.

        <p>Multilayer Perceptrons are a class of Artificial Neural Network, and are groupings of interconnected artificial neurons, or nodes, that use computational algorithms for processing data. Each of these nodes have the capability of transmission to transmit and receive transmission from other nodes. These layers consist of the input layer, at least one hidden layer, and an output layer. These connections between nodes have hidden weight values representing the impact each node has upon the connecting layers. The weight values are finally fed into an activation function which controls the output. The rectifier linear unit (ReLU) is the primary activation function used in our model. This was chosen over sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent functions due to their limitations, namely sensitivity and saturation. The ReLU activation function can be defined as the below formula:Multilayer Perceptrons are a class of Artificial Neural Network, and are groupings of interconnected artificial neurons, or nodes, that use computational algorithms for processing data.

        <p>The machine learning implementation process is described in Fig. 5. As the data comprised different types and scales of features, we normalize all features using Robust Scaler to scale data based on the first and third quartile range to avoid outliers' potential impact. Next, the preprocessed data is split to train and test set with the ratio 80:20. Consequently, the models are built and trained using tenfold cross-validation. 
            <rs type="software">Grid Search</rs> tunes the hyper-parameters and automatically selects the optimal model. Finally, this study conducts two experiments and compares the results from the test set to select the best algorithm to predict the use of healthcare wearables. The confusion matrix and its derived metricsaccuracy, precision, recall, and F1 are used to evaluate the performance of models. As shown in Table B1, the confusion matrix includes four elements, namely true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN). TP and TN are the numbers of wearables users, and non-users accurately predicted, respectively, while FP and FN are the incorrectly classified data. Accuracy is the ratio of accurate wearables users' identification and indicates the effectiveness of the model. Precision and recall scores measure the proportion of wearables users correctly predicted in respective out of all the actual users and all samples (users and non-users). Usually, there will be a trade-off between precision score and recall score, so the F1 score appears to balance these above two scores and is a widely applied performance evaluation metric.
