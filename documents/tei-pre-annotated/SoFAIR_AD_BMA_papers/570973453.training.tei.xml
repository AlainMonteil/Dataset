        <p>Mobile devices have been widely adopted, and their use has sharply increased worldwide. According to a report from the Global Association of Mobile Operators, global mobile phone users exceeded 5.1 billion in 2020, among them, over 1.2 billion users are accounted for in China (GSMA, 2020). Meanwhile, various mobile services are significantly developed and implemented in different industries. Food delivery apps (FDAs) as onlineto-offline mobile services have recently gained popularity offering two-way benefits for catering enterprises and customers by providing convenient and efficient online order and offline delivery services. Statista Reports (2019) illustrated that FDAs revenue in China (38.4 billion US dollar (USD)) generated more than one-third of global FDAs revenue (95.4 billion USD) in 2018. Moreover, global FDAs revenue increased to 107.4 billion USD in 2019 (Statista Reports, 2019), and are expected to exceed 164.5 billion USD by 2024, expanding at a CAGR of 11.4% during 2019-2024 (Imarc, 2020).Mobile devices have been widely adopted, and their use has sharply increased worldwide.

        <p>Meanwhile, the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-2019) erupted as a serious global pandemic from the end of 2019 and reached the whole of China in February 2020, then progressively expanded worldwide (Tang et al., 2020). According to a report from the World Health Organization (WHO), until 21 May 2020, there were a total of 4,904,413 globally confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections and 323,412 deaths (WHO, 2020a). During the COVID-19 crisis, wearing a mask in public, social distancing, self-isolating and other self-protection actions have been highly recommended by the WHO (2020b) to avoid direct and indirect contacts among people to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission (Wilder-Smith and Freedman, 2020; Tang et al., 2020). Moreover, because fewer customers intend to use public services, the traditional catering industry has suffered dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the data of iiMedia Research (2020), in China, the revenue of the catering industry was 419.4 billion yuan (59.2 billion USD) during January to February 2020, which decreased 43.1% year on year. 95.0% of the interviewed catering businesses' revenue of the stores decreased significantly during COVID-19 epidemic period (iiMedia Research, 2020).Meanwhile, the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-2019) erupted as a serious global pandemic from the end of 2019 and reached the whole of China in February 2020, then progressively expanded worldwide (Tang et al., 2020).

        <p>On the other hand, despite the negative influence of COVID-19 significantly affecting the supply and demand of the catering industry, it has changed the consumption habits of residents and accelerated the transformation of catering enterprises from traditional in-store service to online-to-offline service for surviving in the pandemic situation and maintaining sustainable development. According to a report from Meituan research institute (2020), there were 71.7% of 15263 participants using FDAs from the end of February to beginning of March 2020, and 41.6% residents preferred using online-tooffline delivery services to purchase daily supplies during the COVID-19 pandemic period in China. Likewise, iiMedia Research (2020) illustrated that 78% of responded Chinese traditional catering enterprises transferred their business to third-party FDAs (Ele.me, Meituan Waimai and Baidu Waimai). Compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, the catering enterprises registered on FDAs have dramatically increased 63.1% in China, and 70% of the surveyed restaurants will continue to operate and increase investment in FDAs after the COVID-19 epidemic. Moreover, according to the business registration data from Tianyancha (2020), there were 106,000 new enterprise registrations related to food delivery services from January to May 2020, up 766% from the same period in 2019. The estimated scale of the Chinese online food delivery market will exceed 91.8 billion USD in 2020 (iiMedia Research, 2020). Therefore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, "internet + restaurant" mode of FDA not only met the requirements of catering enterprises but also satisfied customers' demands on convenient and efficient food supplies and personal safety concerns (Liu and Wang, 2016).On the other hand, despite the negative influence of COVID-19 significantly affecting the supply and demand of the catering industry, it has changed the consumption habits of residents and accelerated the transformation of catering enterprises from traditional in-store service to online-to-offline service for surviving in the pandemic situation and maintaining sustainable development.

        <p>Accordingly, factors motivating users to use FDAs continuously under the COVID-19 pandemic situation are essential for relevant stakeholders to understand customers' requirements and expectations. In terms of FDA adoption, customers consider performance expectancy as the main determinator to adopt a relevant service (Yeo et al., 2017;Roh and Park, 2019). Moreover, easiness and quality of service, convenience, social influence and satisfaction are also considerable antecedents of intention to adopt FDAs (Yeo et found that trust also has a significant impact on users' continuance usage intention.Accordingly, factors motivating users to use FDAs continuously under the COVID-19 pandemic situation are essential for relevant stakeholders to understand customers' requirements and expectations.

Consequently, the purposes of this study are to fulfil the gap of factors determining users' intention to use FDAs during the COVID-19 period continuously and support FDA relevant stakeholders to understand customers' perceptions and behaviours for efficiently developing business strategies better. Therefore, this paper attempts to establish a comprehensive model integrating variables from ECM, UTAUT and the Task-Technology Fit model, including performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, trust, perceived task-technology fit, confirmation and satisfaction, to investigate the factors affecting users' continuance usage intention of FDAs during the COVID-19 pandemic.Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Task-Technology Fit model to explain that users' continuance usage intention is determined by perceived tasktechnology fit and confirmation.

        <p>FDAs, as an emerging online-to-offline mobile technology, provide a channel between catering enterprises and customers by integrating online order and offline delivery services. FDAs can be categorised into two patterns (Ray et al., 2019). First, the restaurants themselves, such as KFC, Domino's and Pizzahut etc. Second, the third-party intermediary platforms, such as, Uber Eats, Zomato, Ele.me Meituan Waimai and Baidu Waimai, which are more popular and have been widely adopted in China (Roh and Park, 2019). Moreover, in order to adapt and overcome the COVID-19 pandemic situation, the contactless delivery process is applied in China, which delivers food to the gates of customers without direct contact. Meanwhile, FDAs also involve daily supplies delivery service for customers. These additional services establish multi-way benefits in efficiently maintaining social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, enriching service range and reducing the spatio-temporal interval of sales and consumptions processes (Liu and Wang, 2016). Therefore, the quality of FDA services significantly impacts on users' perceptions. Several previous studies have focused on various factors affecting users' intentions to adopt (Cho et al., 2019). Furthermore, the following parts introduce the theoretical foundations that contribute to the conceptualisation of the research model.FDAs, as an emerging online-to-offline mobile technology, provide a channel between catering enterprises and customers by integrating online order and offline delivery services.

        <p>ECM was proposed by Bhattacherjee (2001) and is rooted in the expectation-confirmation theory (ECT) (Oliver, 1980). It consists of three dimensions, including performance expectancy, confirmation and satisfaction for evaluating continuance usage intention of information systems. ECM has been widely implemented in various continuance adoptions of mobile technology. Such as Hung et al. (2012) who modified ECM with the trust factor and proved that consumers' satisfaction and trust had a significant impact on continuance usage intention of mobile shopping. Chong (2013) extended ECM with perceived ease of use, perceived enjoyment, trust and perceived cost to analyse Chinese consumers' satisfaction and continuance usage intentions of m-commerce.ECM was proposed by Bhattacherjee (2001) and is rooted in the expectation-confirmation theory (ECT) (Oliver, 1980).

        <p>Moreover, ECM can also be integrated with other adoption models to investigate the continuance usage intention of a technology. Such as, ECM integrating with TAM explains consumers' continuance usage intentions of various mobile technologies, m-shopping (Shang and Wu, 2017). Mobile Learning System (Alshurideh et al., 2020). Likewise, Yuan et al. (2016) integrated ECM, TAM and the Task-Technology Fit model to explain the significant effects of satisfaction, perceived usefulness, perceived tasktechnology fit and perceived risk on users' continuance usage intentions of mobile banking.Moreover, ECM can also be integrated with other adoption models to investigate the continuance usage intention of a technology.

        <p>Task-Technology Fit model was proposed by Goodhue and Thompson (1995) as the degree of fitness between tasks and technology to assist in the performance of individual daily tasks and the utilisation of technology. On the technology adoption aspect, technology characteristics and functions determine the performance of individual tasks and meet individual requirements (Goodhue and Thompson, 1995). Specifically, in this study, customers' continuance intention of using FDAs during the COVID-19 crisis period is determined on features of FDAs (fast, convenient and contactless food supply services), which fit users' efficient food supply requirements and maintain social distancing demand under the pandemic condition. Moreover, the Task-Technology Fit model has been implemented by various previous studies to analyse users' behavioural intentions of adopting mobile technology in different contexts, such as mobile commerce in the insurance industry (Lee et al., 2007), mobile information systems (Junglas et al., 2008).

        <p>According to previous descriptions, the UTAUT model focuses on predicting users' initial adoption of a new information technology from users' technological expectations rather than mental expectations, which weakly explain users' mental perceptions determining continuance usage intention (Venkatesh, et al., 2011). Accordingly, based on the summary of previous studies related to continuance intention of using information technology (shown in Table 1.), this study integrates the trust, confirmation and satisfaction variables as mental perceptions with technological perceptions to analyse users' continuance intention of using FDAs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, trust is considered as users' general belief of technology, measured against perceived risk and uncertainty, and positively reflects perceived security when adopting new technology (Khalilzadeh et al., 2017;Shao et al., 2018). Moreover, confirmation and satisfaction extracted from ECM can efficiently describe users' expectations on continuously using information technology (Yuan et al., 2016;Almazroa and Gulliver, 2018). Moreover, compared to 
            <rs type="software">UTAUT</rs>, the Task-Technology Fit model focuses more on the relationships among task and technology characteristics, utilisation and performance impact (Yuan et al., 2016).
        </p>
        <p>Particularly, the contactless feature and convenience of FDAs significantly contribute to users perceived technological and mental benefits of using FDAs under COVID-19 pandemic conditions. Therefore, UTAUT, ECM and the Task-Technology Fit model have good complementarities to evaluate the factors affecting users' continuance intention of using FDAs during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to UTAUT, performance expectancy (PE) is defined as the degree to which the user believes that using a particular technology will facilitate his or her performance in a certain activity (Venkatesh et al., 2003). PE is a significant predictor to determine a user's intention to adopt new technology. Concretely related to this study, users perceived the higher utility from FDAs, and the greater intention to continue using them ( Confirmation (COF) is defined as the degree of users' perceptions of an information system is congruent with their prior expectations and actual performances (Bhattacherjee, 2001). In terms of ECM, Bhattacherjee (2001) illustrated that COF as an important factor predicts PE and satisfaction determining user's continuance intention of using the information system. This study refers to COF as the degree of users' confirmations of their initial expectations of FDAs, which affect PE and satisfaction towards continuance usage of FDAs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lee Therefore, satisfaction as a complementary variable of UTAUT and ECM has been proposed in the following hypothesis:Particularly, the contactless feature and convenience of FDAs significantly contribute to users perceived technological and mental benefits of using FDAs under COVID-19 pandemic conditions.

        <p>A questionnaire survey was applied to collect data to validate the conceptual model and examine the research hypotheses. The questionnaire consisted of two parts. The first part concentrated on the demographic information of respondents using close-ended questions, including, gender, age, education, occupation and frequency of using FDAs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The second part comprised of constructs and items referred from pre-validated literature, consisting of 32 measurement items as indicators of variables, including performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), social influence (SI), trust (TR), perceived task-technology fit (TTF), confirmation (COF), satisfaction (SA) and continuance intention (CI) of using FDAs, and the scale items and their references are listed in the Appendix table. According to the large number of measurement items, a five-point scale appears to be less confusing and less time consuming for participants to increase the response rate (Babakus and Mangold, 1992;Bouranta, 2009). Thus, all indicators corresponding to the constructs in the survey were measured by using a five-point Likert scale, which ranges from strongly disagree = "1" to strongly agree = "5".A questionnaire survey was applied to collect data to validate the conceptual model and examine the research hypotheses.

        <p>The main survey target of this research focuses on smartphone users who adopted FDAs during the ongoing COVID-19 virus period in China. The questionnaire was translated into the Chinese language by a professional translator to avoid the impact of culture and language differences. The questionnaire was then reversely translated into English to confirm the translation equivalence. The questionnaire data were collected through an online survey and inquiry through Wechat (Chinese social media platform) over a 3-week period, from 23 March 2020 to 12 April 2020.The main survey target of this research focuses on smartphone users who adopted FDAs during the ongoing COVID-19 virus period in China.

After scrutinising the questionnaire and removing answers with missing values, a total number of 532 valid responses were accepted, achieving a final response rate of 59.1%. The valid data were mainly collected from the Henan province, which is the third-largest population province, consisting of 6.9% of the total population in China. The sample distribution of the male and female respondent groups was compared by using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test and no statistical difference between them was verified (Ryans, 1974)During the data collection period, a total of 900 questionnaires were distributed, and 713 data were collected on 13 April 2020.

        <p>The data analysis followed the two-step approach by Anderson and Gerbing (1988) by using 
            <rs type="software">SPSS</rs>
            <rs type="version">19</rs> and 
            <rs type="software">AMOS</rs>
            <rs type="version">22</rs> software. The first step assessed the reliability and validity of the measurement model. It was followed by examining the structural model and testing the research hypotheses. The maximum likelihood approach was implemented as the model estimation method in this study.
        </p>
        <p>The reliability and validity of the measurement model were assessed by exploratory factor analysis (EFA) via 
            <rs type="software">SPSS</rs> and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) through AMOS. Construct reliability represents the internal consistency of survey items and was measured by Cronbach's alpha (CA). The results in Table 3 reveal that all CAs are in the range of 0.848 to 0.888 and all exceed 0.70 (Nunnally and Bernstein, 1994), which demonstrate eligible construct reliability. Furthermore, CFA is employed to evaluate the convergent and discriminant validity of each dimension. Specifically, convergent validity refers to the high theoretical correlations of the items of a scale where a factor's loadings exceed 0.7 (Henseler et al., 2014). Table 3 confirms that all the loadings are qualified. Moreover, the complemented convergent validity is assessed by Composite Reliability (CR) and Average Variance Extracted (AVE) criteria. The CR value of 0.70 or above is deemed acceptable, and an AVE value suggested higher than the threshold of 0.5 (Fornell and Larcker, 1981). As shown in Table 3, the CR values of all variables range from 0.838 to 0.889. All constructs have AVE values in the range of 0.582 to 0.666. Thus, the convergent validity of the measurement model has been confirmed.
        </p>
        <p>In addition, discriminant validity is defined as the extent to which the indicator is not a reflection of other variables (Lee et al., 2007). The square root of AVE of each latent construct should be higher than any two pairs of its inter-construct correlation to confirm the discriminant validity.In addition, discriminant validity is defined as the extent to which the indicator is not a reflection of other variables (Lee et al., 2007). The square root of AVE of each latent construct should be higher than any two pairs of its inter-construct correlation to confirm the discriminant validity.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the values of the average variance extracted (AVE) of each variable should greater than its maximum shared squared variance (MSV) (Hair et al., 2010). The results of the variables' MSV and square roots of AVE and correlations shown in Table 4, confirm qualified convergent validity and discriminant validity of the measurement model.Meanwhile, the values of the average variance extracted (AVE) of each variable should greater than its maximum shared squared variance (MSV) (Hair et al., 2010).

        <p>Moreover, the model-fit was examined by the following measures: the ratio of chi-square to degrees-of-freedom (X²/df), comparative fit index (CFI), the goodness of fit index (GFI), adjusted goodness-of-fit index (AGFI), normalized fit index (NFI), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR).

            <rs type="software">SPSS</rs>. The results present that the largest variance explained by individual factor is 44% (&lt; 50%). Therefore, the result confirms that none of the factors can individually explain the majority of the variance. Second, a CFA was applied to assess the fitness of a singlefactor model (all items as the indicators of one factor) (Malhotra et al., 2006). The results of model-fit present a poor fitness (v²/df = 6.449(&gt;3), CFI = 0.764 (&lt;0.9), GFI = 0.668 (&lt;0.9), AGFI = 0.622 (&lt;0.9), NFI = 0733 (&lt;0.9), TLI = 0.765 (&lt;0.9), RMSEA = 0.101 (&gt;0.08), SRMS=0.0713 (&gt;0.05)). Therefore, both tests confirm that no common method bias appeared in this study.

        <p>The overall goodness of fit of the structural model was comparably assessed as was the previous CFA of the measurement model. The modelfit results are shown in Table 5, which demonstrates the adequate fitness between the hypothesised structural model and the observed data. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the explanatory power and predictive accuracy of the structural model, the R² (also known as squared multiple correlations or coefficient of determination) of endogenous variables were calculated to show that the degree of their portion of the variance is explained by related exogenous variables (Hair et al., 2010). As shown in Table 6 and Figure 2, the explained variances of performance expectancy, satisfaction and continuance intention are R²=0.70, R²=0.69 and R²=0.78, respectively, which confirm the structural model substantially explains the dependent variable. Moreover, the hypotheses' testing shows that the continuance intention of using FDAs during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is positively determined by performance expectancy (ß=0.228, p&lt;0.001), social influence (ß=0.163, p=0.011), trust (ß=0.271, &lt;0.001), perceived task-technology fit (ß=0.309, p&lt;0.001) and satisfaction (ß=0.341, p&lt;0.001) directly. Thus, hypotheses H1, H6, H8, H10 and H14 are respectively validated. Moreover, the results illustrate that satisfaction is significantly influenced by performance expectancy (ß=0.210, p&lt;0.001), social influence (ß=0.141, p=0.023), trust (ß=0.223, P=0.003), confirmation (ß=0.339, p&lt;0.001) respectively. Therefore, hypotheses H2, H7, H9 and H12 are confirmed. Moreover, perceived task-technology fit (ß=0.536, p&lt;0.001) and confirmation (ß=0.389, p&lt;0.001) are verified and have significant effects on performance expectancy, which support H11 and H13. However, effort expectancy was found to have a negative influence on continuance intention (ß=-0.267, p&lt;0.001), and an insignificant impact on performance expectancy (ß=0.038, p=0.466) and satisfaction (ß=0.041, p=0.399).

        <p>According to the path analysis, it can be concluded that four of the five variables (PE, SI, TR, TTF and SA) emerged as statistically significant antecedents of continuance usage intention of FDAs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wherein satisfaction has the most substantial influence on continuance intention. This result confirms previous studies related to continuance adoption of mobile technologies and services (Dlodlo, Chopdar and Sivakumar (2019). Because users gained enough experience from their previous usage of FDAs, the recognition and familiarity of FDAs will increase by their usage experience. Therefore, the ease of a user will no longer determine users' satisfaction and continuance intention after their initial adoption of FDAs. Meanwhile, during the COVID-19 pandemic, other FDA features, such as, safety, reliability and efficiency, as more important determinants can provide more benefits for users, which more directly influence their satisfaction and continuance usage intention. Second, this study supports FDAs providers and catering business owners with a fundamental understanding of customer's continuance intention as driven by satisfaction, perceived task-technology fit, trust, performance expectancy, confirmation and social influence. Notably, satisfaction, as the most significant determinant of customers' continuance usage intention, has significantly been determined by their mental and technological perception. Meanwhile, the sense of the fitness between technology's feature and users' requirements also play an essential role to formulate customers' perceptions and behaviour. Consequently, relevant stakeholders should focus on taking advantages of the technology's particular characteristic or function, and maintain service quality, reliability and efficiency to optimize users' experience and achieve higher customers' satisfaction, thereby, increasing the continuance acceptance among their target population in a particular situation and future development. Third, this study could be valuable for start-up companies, policymakers, government bodies, and private service providers who are interested in the catering industry. FDAs have become increasingly popular and gradually useful platforms for the survival of the foodservice industry in a particular emergency (COVID-19 pandemic), as well as continuously developing after crises. This popularity is determined by customers' increasing willingness to enjoy food at home as well as self-protection during the pandemic period, which has also formulated new consumption habits for continuance usage. Finally, the findings of this study could be applied as references for other online-to-offline service industries, such as, online real estate services and online hospitality industry. Relevant businesses could utilise the findings from this study to develop appropriate strategies by integrating specific technology features with customers' technological and mental perceptions for expanding their market and build a better sustainable customer base not only in crises situations but also for future development.According to the path analysis, it can be concluded that four of the five variables (PE, SI, TR, TTF and SA) emerged as statistically significant antecedents of continuance usage intention of FDAs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

        <p>This section summarises three main limitations of the current study and provides relevant recommendations for future research. First, this study mainly focuses on users of FDAs in China, and the results of this study may not be generalisable to different cultures, regions and countries. Therefore, future research is recommended to pay attention to different regions or countries. Moreover, comparisons across cultures are also highly encouraged. Second, this study only conducts a short-term reflection of users' perception towards continuance usage intention of FDAs, especially, in a particular situation (COVID-19 pandemic context). According to the spatio-temporal dynamic of individual's behaviour and intention, future research can apply longitudinal and experimental methods to explore users' perceptions in different situations and investigate causality over time and make comparisons, to more comprehensively explain users' continuance usage intentions of technology. Third, the current study does not distinguish the different FDA platforms such as Ele.me, Meituan waimai, Baidu Waimai, and Uber eats. Meanwhile, the study focuses on the customers' perspectives towards FDAs only. Consequently, the research model can be generalised to apply on distinguishing the different FDA platforms, different stakeholders, e.g. business owners, service providers, and other contexts of the online-to-offline service industry, such as online real estate platforms and online-to-offline hospitality services.This section summarises three main limitations of the current study and provides relevant recommendations for future research.

        <p>In conclusion, at the nascent stage of FDA development, an increasing number of scholars have attracted their attention in the related field. This study applies an empirical study with a high explanatory power of examining factors affecting users' continuance usage intention of FDAs during the COVID-19 pandemic, which significantly contributes to the literature of continuance adoption of information technology. Furthermore, the current study proposed a comprehensive model integrating UTAUT, ECM and the Task-Technology Fit model and investigated 532 FDA users in China by a quantitative research method. The research model consists of seven factors, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, trust, perceived task-technology fit confirmation and satisfaction, to explore the determinators of users' continuance intention of using FDAs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The measurement model demonstrates good construct reliability and sufficient convergent and divergent validity. The results of this study conclude that customers' continuance intention of using FDAs during the COVID-19 pandemic is not only significantly determined by satisfaction, but also dramatically influenced by perceived task-technology fit, trust, performance expectancy and social influence. Moreover, it is necessary to emphasize that user perceived task-technology fit plays a crucial role to formulate users' technological and mental perceptions when the technology' characteristic is beneficial to a specific situation. However, this study does not find strong associations between effort expectancy with other variables (performance expectancy, satisfaction and continuance intention). In addition, this study contributes with various theoretical and practical implications. The perceived task-technology fit is an essential antecedent of UTAUT, which associates ECM can complementarily explain users' technological and mental perceptions determining on their continuance usage intention. Relevant researches and stakeholders should combine particular technology features with users' technological and mental perceptions to analyse and understand users' behaviour and continuance intention in a specific situation integrally.In conclusion, at the nascent stage of FDA development, an increasing number of scholars have attracted their attention in the related field.
