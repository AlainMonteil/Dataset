        <p>Business Strategy and the Environment (BSE) is a premier journal dedicated to interdisciplinary research that advances business practice leading to improvements in environmental performance. Using big data analytics, this review examines the intellectual structure and the drivers of research impact of BSE in the scholarly domain.</p>
        <p>The bibliometric results suggest three major findings. First, the top three countries contributing to BSE are the United Kingdom, the United States, and China. Second, BSE's research manifests through five thematic clusters, namely, business strategy and sustainability; corporate governance and sustainability reporting; green marketing and pro-environmental behavior; innovation and environmental policy; and environmental management systems. Finally, BSE's research impact in terms of citations is significantly influenced by author affiliation (United States); article age (older), appearance (lead article and special issue), length (longer), and method (mix methods); title length (shorter title); and number of keywords (more keywords) and references (more references). Implications for BSE's readers and future contributors are discussed.</p>
        <p>In the foreword of Business Strategy and the Environment's (BSE) inaugural issue, Faulkner (1992), a co-founder of the Business Council for Sustainable Development and a former minister in the Canadian government, highlighted that concern for the environment, particularly environmental degradation, was one of the defining characteristics of the 20th century that has evolved and deepened over time. Yet the awareness and understanding of the causes and effects of environmental degradation, especially among the business community and society at large, were lacking. Recognizing these gaps, governmental and intergovernmental organizations such as the United Nations embarked on initiatives such as "Our Common Goals" to encourage global partnerships for sustainable development. Similarly, BSE recognized the need of the hour and was therefore established in 1992 by founding editor Denis Smith to curate interdisciplinary research dedicated to advancing business practice leading to improvements in environmental performance.</p>
        <p>Today, BSE, under the current editorship of Richard Welford, is widely recognized as the leading home for scholarly research at the nexus of business strategy and environmental management. Indeed, the journal, which seeks to provide original contributions that add to Moving forward, this review endeavors to examine the intellectual structure and drivers of research impact of BSE in order to curate a state-of-the-art overview of existing research and an agenda for future research on business strategy and environmental management.</p>
        <p>To do so, this review relies on the entire corpus of 1245 articles published in BSE between 1992 and 2020 using big data analytics, a method that exemplifies the analysis of large datasets to identify hidden patterns or linkages (Chen et al., 2012;George et al., 2014). In other words, the study conducted herein represents a literature review by means of big data analytics.</p>
        <p>According to Tranfield et al. (2003), literature reviews are the most used method for synthesizing and summarizing a domain in the scientific body of knowledge. Among the many ways to conduct literature reviews (e.g., domain-, theory-, or method-based reviews; Paul &amp; Criado, 2020), bibliometric reviews, which rely on big data analytics in the form of bibliometric analysis, are arguably one of the most scientific and sophisticated methods for reviewing literature.</p>
        <p>In essence, bibliometric reviews analyze bibliographic data of a scientific corpus (Broadus, 1987;Pritchard, 1969), wherein the trends (e.g., patterns and linkages) of constituents and themes in a research domain are established and scrutinized (Cobo et al., 2011;Ramos-Rodrígue &amp; Ruíz-Navarro, 2004).</p>
        <p>Ideally, bibliometric reviews should be all encompassing-that is, they should not only describe but also flag the pertinent factors that significantly contribute to explaining observed trends. However, most bibliometric reviews contribute to the former but neglect or overlook the latter. For example, the recent bibliometric review of BSE by Farrukh et al. (2020) describes the trends in publications and citations in terms of authors, institutions, and countries, whereas a similar review by Kabongo (2020) reveals the authors and teams contributing to research published in the journal.</p>
        <p>Building on the fundamental insights shed by Farrukh et al. (2020) and Kabongo (2020), the present review extends those insights by focusing on the context (e.g., country, industry, and method) and content (e.g., themes) of business strategy and environmental research published in BSE, including the journal's evolution and the drivers of its research impact in the field. In doing so, this review answers three overarching research questions:</p>
        <p>1. Where have business strategy and environmental research been conducted in BSE? The result of this paper is structured as follows. First, the paper explains the methodology guiding its review of the BSE corpus.</p>
        <p>Second, the paper presents the context (e.g., country, industry, and method) of business strategy and environmental research in BSE.</p>
        <p>Third, the paper reveals the thematic clusters in the intellectual structure of the BSE corpus. Fourth, the paper sheds light on the drivers of research impact of BSE. Finally, the paper concludes with a summary of key takeaways and an agenda for future business strategy and environmental research in BSE.</p>
        <p>The data for this review-that is, the BSE corpus-were obtained from Scopus, which is one of the largest scholarly database of peerreviewed literature (Bartol et al., 2014;Norris &amp; Oppenheim, 2007).</p>
        <p>Scopus is also a widely accepted database for big data analysis (Donthu et al., 2021;Dur an-S anchez et al., 2019;Guerrero-Baena et al., 2014;Silveira &amp; Zilber, 2017), thereby justifying its suitability for this review. Specifically, the search for the BSE corpus on Scopus using "Business Strategy and the Environment" in the search title returned 1459 documents consisting of articles, editorials, erratum, and notes published from 1992 to 2021. To provide a more accurate representation of the journal's performance, this review sought to use full year data, and thus, only the bibliometrics, citations, keywords, and abstracts of articles published in the journal from 1992 to 2020 were extracted and recorded for review (i.e., total of 1229 articles).</p>
        <p>The analysis in this review is predicated on bibliometric analysis, which is a form of big data analytics performed on bibliometric data to gain high-level granular insights into a review domain (Norder et al., 2018), and in the present review, insights into the intellectual structure and drivers of research impact of business strategy and environmental research in BSE. Specifically, bibliometric analysis analyzes bibliometric data of a large corpus of literature to identify major themes and thematic shifts, thereby providing a comprehensive overview of the literature under study (Crane, 1972;Donthu et al., 2021). Indeed, there is substantial literature opting to use bibliometric analysis to analyze the thematic structure and evolution of journals and research fields (Donthu et al., 2021). For instance, Werner (2002) explored the major trends and developments in international management using bibliometrics, whereas Backhaus et al. (2011) studied the same but for business-to-business research using citation and co-citation analysis. Similarly, Baker et al. (2021a) used bibliometric coupling and keyword co-occurrences to plot the intellectual structure of Small Business Economics, whereas Kumar et al. (2021) explored the intellectual structure and development of Electronic Commerce Research using co-authorship, bibliographic coupling, keyword, and performance analyses. More importantly, bibliometric analysis, which is an analysis capable of handling large datasets, is suitable for reviews such as the present one, where the bibliometric data and corpus are substantially large and therefore not practical for a manual review (Donthu et al., 2021).</p>
        <p>This review begins with a descriptive analysis of bibliometric data pertaining to the context of business strategy and environmental research in BSE-namely, the countries, industries, and methods prevalent in existing research published in the journal.</p>
        <p>Next, the review maps the intellectual structure of business strategy and environmental research in BSE using bibliographic coupling, which is a widely employed bibliometric method to map the intellectual structure of a research domain (Aria &amp; Cuccurullo, 2017).</p>
        <p>In essence, bibliographic coupling is a technique to form bibliographic couples that emerge from documents that refer to common documents (or same references), wherein the assumption is that documents forming bibliographic couples are inclined to share a similar intellectual structure, and thus, the strength of association between two documents is reflected through the number of common references that they share (Donthu et al., 2021;Kessler, 1963). Specifically, the thematic clusters that form the intellectual structure of BSE are identified through bibliographic coupling using 
            <rs type="software">VOSviewer</rs>, which is a software that uses common reference counts to compute the association and the strength of association between nodes (articles) as inputs for modularity illustration (Newman &amp; Girvan, 2004;van Eck &amp; Waltman, 2017).
        </p>
        <p>Subsequently, the review maps the thematic evolution of business strategy and environmental research in BSE using keyword co-occurrence analysis. Past research suggests that keywords are an insignia of themes in scientific publications (Strozzi et al., 2017;Zou et al., 2018), as they represent research intent (Comerio &amp; Strozzi, 2019), and thus, they can effectively reveal the thematic development of research fields (Callon et al., 1983). Articles that share common keywords can therefore reflect the convergence of research themes (Ding et al., 2001;Schiuma et al., 2021). Using the bibliometric data on article title (before 2005) and author keywords (from 2005) retrieved from Scopus, the review identifies the co-occurrence of keywords over different periods using RStudio.</p>
        <p>Finally, this review examines the drivers of research impact of business strategy and environmental research in BSE through the lens of citations. In essence, the citations that an article receives represent the influence or impact of that article in the scientific community (Donthu et al., 2021;Tsay, 2009). Indeed, citation analysis is commonly undertaken in scientific literature to gauge the impact of articles in the field (Kumar et al., 2021). However, this review does not intend to replicate the citation analysis of past reviews of BSE (e.g., Farrukh et al., 2020;Kabongo, 2020). Instead, this review endeavors to extend insights in this direction through an examination of the drivers of article citations in BSE, as a proxy of the journal's research impact. Specifically, the predictive factors of article citations are drawn from prior studies and taken as independent variables (Dang &amp; Li, 2020;Meyer et al., 2018;Stremersch et al., 2007), the total citations of each article are taken as the dependent variable, and the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is analyzed using negative binomial regression analysis.</p>
        <p>Unlike the review by Farrukh et al. (2020) that shed light on the countries that (1) cited BSE articles the most and that (2) used similar literature in their BSE articles, this review concentrates on revealing country-level insights on the basis of research samples-that is, samples of participants in research published by BSE (see Table 1).</p>
        <p>Interestingly, we found that most studies (20.67%) in BSE have considered research samples from multiple countries, thereby indicating high diversity in research samples at the article level.</p>
        <p>Similarly, we noted research samples from more than 50 countries in the BSE corpus (i.e., articles specifying samples from either 55 countries or four regions [i.e., Africa, Europe, Latin America, or multiple countries]), which suggests that research samples are highly diverse at the journal level. Nevertheless, we noticed that business strategy and environmental research in developing countries (e.g., Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Nigeria) and regions (e.g., Africa and South Asia) are substantially less in numbers as compared to that coming from developed countries (e.g., United Kingdom and United States) and regions (e.g., America and Europe), which indicates a contextual gap that could spur additional business strategy and environmental research in these underexplored countries and regions in BSE in the future.</p>
        <p>This review finds that 23.52% (n = 289) of business strategy and environmental research in BSE are industry specific (see Figure 1). The most studied industry is the energy industry (n = 38), followed by the automotive, banking and finance, and chemical industries, with 23 articles each. Industries that are underexplored are those with single-digit articles (e.g., biotechnology, engineering, diary, education, fashion, and logistics) and thus can be further explored in future research intending to unpack industry-specific insights pertaining to business practices and environmental performance. Indeed, industryspecific research can be beneficial for developing business strategies that improve environmental performance in ways that resonate with the unique peculiarities of the industry under study (e.g., accounting for carbon emissions for manufacturing-based industries and cost savings from energy efficiency for service-based industries).</p>
        <p>The methodology underpinning the research of each BSE article was manually coded for analysis. Manual coding is a common technique to record methodology in literature reviews as such information are not captured through bibliometric databases such as Scopus. Specifically, the research approach, data collection method, and data analysis technique used in each BSE article were coded to allow us to obtain in-depth insights on the methodological trends in BSE research.</p>
        <p>Findings from the review suggest that most research in BSE have relied on quantitative methods (50%), followed by qualitative (35%), review (12%), and mixed (3%) methods (see Figure 2). Interestingly, most research in BSE have used secondary data (43%). Survey was used the most to gather primary data (24%), whereas in-depth interviews (17%) were most popular for gathering qualitative data, as opposed to focus group interviews and observations, which represented 1% each in BSE (see Figure 3). Finally, most research in BSE have employed regression analysis (n = 345), followed by content</p>
        <p>The intellectual structure of the BSE corpus is explored through bibliographic coupling. In particular, the bibliographic coupling of 1229 articles in BSE between 1992 and 2020 reveals five thematic clusters that account for more than 80% of research in the journal.</p>
        <p>The descriptive statistics and the most influential articles of each cluster are presented in Tables 2 and3, respectively. The summary of each cluster is provided in the next subsections.</p>
        <p>The thematic evolution of business strategy and environmental research in BSE corpus is mapped using keyword co-occurrence analysis. It is important to note that keywords of articles in BSE did not appear before 2005, and thus, the titles of such articles were tracked instead, wherein the words that appeared in the title of these articles were mapped and their frequencies were calculated; whereas, author keywords were mapped and have their frequencies computed for BSE articles published from 2005 onwards.</p>
        <p>In essence, the co-occurrence analysis indicate that keywords captured the major topics of the BSE corpus over its lifespan, with newer terms or topics added over time. In total, this review identifies 572 keywords in BSE that had a minimum of two occurrences. The top 30 keywords appearing in BSE between 1992 and 2020 are presented in Table 4.</p>
        <p>In general, the findings of the analysis suggest that most business</p>
        <p>The first decade of BSE, which was between 1992 and 2001, began with research focusing on business strategies incorporating environmental considerations (e.g., "environment," "issues," and "practice"), followed by the sustainability of these strategies (e.g., "development," "sustainable," and "sustainability"), with an emerging focus on industry-specific insights (e.g., "chemical," "industrial," and "sector").</p>
        <p>Indeed, environmental concern appears to be a consistently prominent theme throughout this decade, as seen through the manifestation of associated keywords such as "environment," "environmental," and "green." This evaluation of evolution is predicated on the observations of the trending keywords in Figure 5, which illustrates the topic evolution of BSE research between 1992 and 2001.</p>
        <p>The second decade of BSE, which was between 2002 and 2011, appears to be a breakthrough decade for the journal given the emergence of topics that synthesize business strategy and the environment. Specifically, though environmental concerns and sustainability remained steadfast (e.g., "environment," "environmental,"</p>
        <p>and "sustainability"), we observed new topics pertaining to the business (e.g., "SMEs" and "strategy"), the environment (e.g., "climate change" and "sustainable consumption"), and a hybrid of the two (e.g., "corporate social responsibility," "environmental management,"</p>
        <p>"environmental management systems," "environmental policy,"</p>
        <p>"industrial ecology," and "ISO 14001"). Indeed, the emergence of new topics in this decade reflect the pursuit of novelty in research accepted and published by BSE. This evaluation of evolution is predicated on the observations of trending keywords in Figure 6, which illustrates the topic evolution of BSE research between 1992 and 2001.</p>
        <p>The third decade of BSE, which was between 2012 and 2020, represented a period of significant growth, where proliferation in the quantity and variety of keywords pertaining to business strategy and the environment was most prominent as compared to the preceding decades. In particular, we observed the extension of research topics from the previous two decades (e.g., "climate change," "corporate social responsibility," "environmental management," and "sustainability"), which suggests that business actions to improve environmental performance are not a "one-off" but rather a continuing endeavor. We also noted the emergence of new research topics, whereby the initial years of BSE in this decade concentrated on topics such as "board of directors," "eco-efficiency," "environmental reporting,"</p>
        <p>"pollution prevention," and "supply chain management," whereas the later years focused on topics such as "circular economy," "ecoinnovation," "gender diversity," "green innovation," "green-washing,"</p>
        <p>"integrated reporting," and "legitimacy theory," among others. Taken collectively, these observations suggest that BSE has remained steadfast with current issues and topics of interest and that the journal remains committed to its mission to act as a curator of business strategies that improve environmental performance. This evaluation of evolution is predicated on the observations of trending keywords in Figure 7, which illustrates the topic evolution of BSE research between 2012 and 2020.</p>
        <p>The drivers of research impact of BSE articles are examined through the lens of citations, wherein the total citations of each article are treated as a dependent variable that objectively measures research impact (Hota et al., 2020). The total citations of a BSE article are defined as the number of citations credited to that article since publication, which range from 0 to 1384 based on bibliometric data retrieved from Scopus. Negative binomial regression, which is widely used in past studies (Baker et al., 2021b;Dang &amp; Li, 2020;Stremersch et al., 2007Stremersch et al., , 2015;;Valtakoski, 2019), is used to examine the significance of the drivers of research impact in BSE, as the dependent variable-that is, total citations-has overdispersion given that its mean is smaller than its variance.</p>
        <p>Prior research highlights three perspectives relevant to the examination of research impact through citations: universalist, social constructivist, and presentation (Dang &amp; Li, 2020;Meyer et al., 2018;Stremersch et al., 2007). The universalist perspective suggests that the primary driver of an article's citation is its content (Chan et al., 2009;Dang &amp; Li, 2020;Meyer et al., 2018;Schwert, 1993;Stremersch et al., 2007Stremersch et al., , 2015;;Valtakoski, 2019). In contrast, the social constructivist perspective deals with author and author affiliations of an article, wherein an article's citation count is said to be dependent on the author's reputation (Chan et al., 2009;Dang &amp; Li, 2020;Meyer et al., 2018;Stremersch et al., 2007;Valtakoski, 2019). Whereas, the presentation perspective suggests that an article's citation depends on its presentation (e.g., title and number of keywords) (Chan et al., 2009;Dang &amp; Li, 2020;Meyer et al., 2018;Stremersch et al., 2007;Valtakoski, 2019).</p>
        <p>This review considers 12 factors from the universalist, social constructivist, and presentation perspectives that could drive research impact in terms of citations based on the recommendation of prior studies (Chan et al., 2009;Russell-Bennett &amp; Baron, 2016;Schwert, 1993;Stremersch et al., 2007;Valtakoski, 2019). Factors As a whole, this review hopes that the insights herein, which advance and supplement the insights derived from past reviews of BSE (e.g., Farrukh et al., 2020;Kabongo, 2020), will be useful to the readers and future contributors of BSE. The state-of-the-art retrospection of the intellectual structure of BSE in terms of its context and content should help future research to locate their contributions in the appropriate thematic cluster(s) and equivalent discussion in the journal. Importantly, the research agenda that was curated through research questions for future exploration as well as the significant drivers of research impact should help future research to design courageous, rigorous research and thus to increase its publication success in BSE.</p>

        <p>To this end, this review has provided a retrospection on the intellectual structure and the drivers of research impact of BSE. The key takeaways from this retrospection can be summarized as follows.</p>
        <p>First Third, this review reveals that BSE publishes research relying on a wide range of methodologies (e.g., case studies and reviews; quantitative, qualitative, and mix methods; and primary and secondary data).</p>
        <p>However, we encourage future research to consider employing a variety of methodologies in their business strategy and environmental research given that our negative binomial regression results indicate that mixed methodologies have a positive and highly significant impact on article citations in BSE and that such methodologies typically allow for triangulation and thus improve the rigor (reliability and validity) of research findings. Thus, we propose the following RQ for future research exploration:</p>
        <p>RQ3. How can business strategy and environmental research be designed using mix methodologies logically, pragmatically, and scientifically to produce the richest and most rigorous findings for theory, practice, and public policy? RQ4. How can business strategies that improve environmental performance continue to evolve with agility, creativity, and impact to succeed in highly volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous environments, and in the process of doing so, acquire transient and maintain sustainable competitive advantages?</p>
        <p>RQ5. How can the latest theories, models, or frameworks that avail in disciplines such as accounting, marketing, and management be</p>
