        <p>This paper argues incumbent firms may acquire innovative targets solely to discontinue the target's innovation projects and preempt future competition. We call such acquisitions "killer acquisitions." We develop a model illustrating this phenomenon. Using pharmaceutical industry data, we show that acquired drug projects are less likely to be developed when they overlap with the acquirer's existing product portfolio, especially when the acquirer's market power is large due to weak competition or distant patent expiration. Conservative estimates indicate 5.3 percent to 7.4 percent of acquisitions in our sample are killer acquisitions. These acquisitions disproportionately occur just below thresholds for antitrust scrutiny.This paper argues incumbent firms may acquire innovative targets solely to discontinue the target's innovation projects and preempt future competition.

        <p>Innovation drives economic growth and firm profitability. Innovating firms are often acquired by incumbents, typically in the early stages of product development. Economists traditionally view this positively: firms that are better at exploiting technologies acquire innovative targets to realize synergies, effectively enabling specialization and subsequently increasing innovation and overall welfare. In this paper, we propose and test a different motive for acquisitions of innovating firms. We argue that an incumbent firm may acquire an innovative target and terminate the development of the target's innovations to preempt future competition. We call such acquisitions "killer acquisitions," as they eliminate potentially promising, yet likely competing, innovation.Innovation drives economic growth and firm profitability.

        <p>A recent case involving the pharmaceutical firm Questcor (a subsidiary of Mallinckrodt) illustrates this phenomenon. In the early 2000s, Questcor enjoyed a monopoly in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) drugs with its product Acthar, which treats rare, serious conditions, including infantile spasms. In the mid-2000s, Synacthen, a synthetic competitor to Acthar, began development for the US market. Questcor acquired the US development rights for Synacthen in 2013. Following the logic of killer acquisitions (i.e., shutting down competition even before there is a marketable product), Questcor did not develop Synacthen. As the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) argued in an antitrust complaint, "with the acquisition of Synacthen, Questcor thwarted a nascent challenge to its Acthar monopoly." 1 In other words, Questcor acquired and eliminated competition preemptively. 2 This paper theoretically and empirically studies killer acquisitions. To motivate the empirical analysis, we first build a parsimonious model that combines endogenous acquisition decisions, innovation choices, and product market competition. Our model formalizes the 1 FTC Matter/File Number: 1310172, "Complaint for Injunctive and Other Equitable Relief," https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/170118mallinckrodt_complaint_public.pdf.A recent case involving the pharmaceutical firm Questcor (a subsidiary of Mallinckrodt) illustrates this phenomenon.

        <p>2 The attempted acquisition of Heartware by Thoratec, both medical device firms, in 2009 provides another example of an acquisition aimed at preemptively eliminating innovative competition. At the time, Thoratec had a monopoly in the US market for left ventricular assist devices (LVAD), a life-sustaining technology for end-stage heart failure patients, and Heartware ran clinical trials for its own potentially competing device (the "HVAD") but had yet to receive Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. In its complaint the FTC argued that "Thoratec's proposed $282 million acquisition of Heartware threatens to eliminate the one company poised to seriously challenge Thoratec's monopoly of the US LVAD market. By acquiring Heartware, Thoratec willfully seeks to maintain its LVAD monopoly, thereby denying patients the potentially life-saving benefits of competition between Thoratec and HeartWare" (FTC Administrative Complaint Docket No. 9339: https: //www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cases/2009/07/090730thorateadminccmpt.pdf).2 The attempted acquisition of Heartware by Thoratec, both medical device firms, in 2009 provides another example of an acquisition aimed at preemptively eliminating innovative competition.

        <p>We model acquisitions that occur when the innovative target firm's project is still under development, and therefore further development is necessary and costly and the ultimate project success is uncertain. An incumbent acquirer has weaker incentives to continue development than an entrepreneur if the new project overlaps with (i.e., substitutes for) a product or project in the incumbent's portfolio. This is a general, well-known result: "the monopolist's disincentive created by his preinvention monopoly profits" (Arrow, 1962). We show that this disincentive to innovate can be so strong that an incumbent firm may acquire an innovative start-up simply to shut down the start-up's projects and thereby stem the "gale of creative destruction" of new inventions (Schumpeter, 1942). Importantly, some degree of acquirer-target overlap is necessary for the killer acquisition motive to exist. However, both existing and future competition reduce the difference in project development decisions between acquirers and entrepreneurs and thereby diminish the incentive for killer acquisitions. Finally, we show that killer acquisitions continue to exist even when the entrepreneur's new project is qualitatively superior to the incumbents' existing projects or products, when incumbents benefit from development synergies relative to the entrepreneur, and when there are multiple (asymmetric) potential acquirers.We model acquisitions that occur when the innovative target firm's project is still under development, and therefore further development is necessary and costly and the ultimate project success is uncertain.

        <p>In the second part of the paper, we provide empirical support for our theory. Doing so presents significant empirical challenges. We need to observe project-level development activity and track projects as they move across firms. It is also crucial to accurately measure overlap between the acquiring firm's portfolio and the target's project and to quantify competition in the relevant product market.In the second part of the paper, we provide empirical support for our theory.

        <p>Pharmaceutical drug development offers features to resolve all of these challenges. Further, documenting killer acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry is also worthwhile since the industry is highly innovative and the successful commercialization of innovative drugs is potentially very socially valuable. 3 We collect detailed development information on more than 16,000 drug projects originated by more than 4,000 companies in the past two-and-a-half decades and follow each drug from initiation. We collect relevant acquisition events from comprehensive data sources. Importantly, we observe development milestones of drug projects independent of project ownership, meaning we can follow the same projects pre-and post-acquisition. 4To finely categorize acquirer overlap with the target's project, and thus identify potentially competing products, we use pharmaceutical categories based on disease and mechanism. Specifically, if the target's drug project is in the same therapeutic class (e.g., antihypertensive) and uses the same mechanism of action (e.g., calcium channel antagonist) as a drug product or project in the acquirer's portfolio, we consider that acquisition to be an overlapping acquisition. Measuring overlap this way helps to ensure we are capturing potential substitutes (i.e., companies developing drugs that, if successful, would directly compete with the acquirer).Pharmaceutical drug development offers features to resolve all of these challenges.

        <p>Our main empirical analyses focus on the development of drug projects. We compare projects acquired by overlapping incumbents to those acquired by non-overlapping incumbents and to non-acquired projects. The baseline regression uses a project-year panel to estimate the annual probability of development activity (i.e., lack of project termination). Following the logic of killer acquisitions, we expect a decreased likelihood of the development of overlapping projects post-acquisition. Correspondingly, we find that projects acquired by an incumbent with an overlapping drug are 23.4 percent less likely to have continued development activity compared to drugs acquired by non-overlapping incumbents. Reassuringly, the development patterns for overlapping acquired drugs are statistically indistinguishable from non-overlapping acquired drugs and non-acquired drugs in the years before acquisition. This finding is robust to controlling for a variety of economic forces. We control for project vintage and age, and subsequently for drug development life cycles using therapeutic classmechanism of action-age fixed effects, which effectively help us compare drugs in the same stage along the same development trajectory. We also include project fixed effects to account for any unobservable time-invariant project characteristics. In addition, to control for selection into acquisition based on observable, time-varying characteristics, we implement a propensity score reweighting estimator.Our main empirical analyses focus on the development of drug projects.

        <p>We use several alternative specifications, subsamples, and analyses to confirm the robustness of our baseline results. Most importantly, we find decreased development post-acquisition for overlapping acquired projects is driven by drugs that have no further development activity post-acquisition (i.e., by immediate and permanent terminations). Projects acquired by overlapping acquirers are 20.9 percent more likely to cease development immediately compared to those acquired by non-overlapping incumbents. Further, we find no evidence that acquiring firms purposefully delay development or are simply slower at developing overlapping projects.We use several alternative specifications, subsamples, and analyses to confirm the robustness of our baseline results.

        <p>Our theory also predicts that incumbents have a stronger incentive to acquire and terminate overlapping innovation in ex-ante less competitive markets (i.e., when the incumbent has more to lose if the target's innovation is successfully developed). To examine this, we repeat the baseline analysis in subsamples with low and high levels of existing competition (as measured by the number of competing drugs in the same therapeutic class and mechanism of action). We find that the decrease in development probability for acquired overlapping projects is concentrated in markets with low competition. Our theory also predicts that when the incumbent's drug is far from patent expiration, and thus generic competition, incumbents have a stronger incentive to acquire and terminate innovation because the loss from cannibalization is large. Accordingly, we find that the decrease in development rates is concentrated in overlapping acquisitions for which the patent on the acquirer's overlapping drug is relatively far from expiry.Our theory also predicts that incumbents have a stronger incentive to acquire and terminate overlapping innovation in ex-ante less competitive markets (i.e., when the incumbent has more to lose if the target's innovation is successfully developed).

        <p>Despite the difficulties associated with testing for strategic motives, our empirical results suggest that killer acquisitions are both strategic and intentional. First, as our model predicts, we find that acquisitions are more likely when the incumbent acquirer's products overlap with the target project by almost four times. 5 Second, we find that acquirers conducting killer acquisitions are much more likely to undertake acquisition deals that do not trigger FTC notification requirements for premerger review and thereby avoid antitrust scrutiny. Acquisitions of overlapping targets bunch just below the FTC acquisition transaction value threshold, while 5 In our model, overlapping acquisitions do not occur because they have a positive "direct" effect on the acquiring incumbent's profits (e.g., due to synergies between acquirer and target) but rather because they allow the acquirer to change the target's behavior (e.g., the overlapping project is never developed), which is beneficial for the incumbent only when there is product-project overlap. Ellison and Ellison (2011) also study incumbents' strategic motives in the pharmaceutical industry, but they focus on investment and advertising choices to deter entry. In their setting, the strategic motive is identified by the nonmonotonicity of investment with respect to market size, whereas in ours, it is identified by the lack of development of overlapping acquired projects.Despite the difficulties associated with testing for strategic motives, our empirical results suggest that killer acquisitions are both strategic and intentional.

        <p>there is no such pattern for non-overlapping acquisitions. In addition, these below-threshold deals exhibit much higher termination rates and much lower launch rates.there is no such pattern for non-overlapping acquisitions. In addition, these below-threshold deals exhibit much higher termination rates and much lower launch rates.</p>
        <p>We employ several additional tests to address potential alternative explanations for lower development rates of overlapping acquired drugs. One alternative explanation is optimal project selection. Specifically, for multiproject targets, the acquirer could strategically and optimally choose to continue only the most promising projects while discontinuing those that are less promising. However, our results hold in the subsample of acquisitions of single-drug companies, implying optimal project selection does not explain our results. Another alternative explanation is capital redeployment, in which the acquiring firm's intention is to acquire and redeploy the acquired target's core assets-i.e., its underlying technology or human capital-to more productive uses. If this were the case, our results on decreased development of overlapping acquired projects could be explained simply as a by-product. To address this, we separately consider technology and human capital redeployment. To explore technology redeployment, we track the chemical similarity of acquired drugs to pre-and post-acquisition projects of the acquirer, finding no evidence supporting the idea that acquired technologies are integrated into acquirers' new drug development projects. We also do not find that acquirers are more likely to cite acquired and terminated projects' patents. To explore human capital redeployment, we examine inventor mobility and productivity around the acquisition events.We employ several additional tests to address potential alternative explanations for lower development rates of overlapping acquired drugs.

        <p>We show that only 22 percent of inventors from target firms eventually work for the acquiring firm and further that those inventors do not become more productive post-acquisition. These results are inconsistent with explanations regarding technology or human capital redeployment.We show that only 22 percent of inventors from target firms eventually work for the acquiring firm and further that those inventors do not become more productive post-acquisition.

        <p>A related alternative explanation is "salvage" acquisitions in which overlapping acquirers buy already-failing targets to (cheaply) acquire the target's valuable assets. Following this logic, decreases in development would predate the relevant acquisition, which would also have lower post-acquisition development activity. Contrary to the salvage explanation, however, we find no evidence that overlapping acquisitions have either pre-acquisition declines in development or lower valuations, on average, compared to non-overlapping acquisitions.A related alternative explanation is "salvage" acquisitions in which overlapping acquirers buy already-failing targets to (cheaply) acquire the target's valuable assets.

        <p>Our conservative estimates indicate that between 5.3 percent and 7.4 percent of all acquisitions in our sample (or about 46 to 63 pharmaceutical acquisitions per year) are killer acquisitions. Eliminating the adverse effect on drug project development from killer acquisitions would raise the pharmaceutical industry's aggregate drug project development rate by more than 4 percent. However, despite the ex-post inefficiencies of killer acquisitions and their adverse effect on consumer surplus, the overall effect on social welfare is ambiguous because these acquisitions may increase ex-ante incentives for the creation of new drug projects but also distort the direction of innovation. 6Our conservative estimates indicate that between 5.3 percent and 7.4 percent of all acquisitions in our sample (or about 46 to 63 pharmaceutical acquisitions per year) are killer acquisitions.

        <p>Our goal is to uncover an unobservable strategic motive, killer acquisitions, from observable outcomes. To do so, we empirically compare development probabilities of overlapping acquisitions, which are, in our theory, motivated by a mix of killer and development intentions, and non-overlapping acquisitions, which are only motivated by development intentions. We find an increase in acquisition probability and a decrease in post-acquisition development for overlapping acquisitions and interpret that as evidence for killer acquisitions. Importantly, killer acquisitions necessarily involve a combination of the choice to acquire an overlapping target and the resulting reduced incentives to develop drug projects that cannibalize the acquirer's existing profits. These combined effects are quite different from the effects arising from random allocation of new drug projects to incumbent firms with or without product market overlap, and thus we do not analyze quasi-random acquisitions and outcomes. Instead, we combine empirical evidence consistent with our theory and various analyses to rule out plausible alternative explanations.Our goal is to uncover an unobservable strategic motive, killer acquisitions, from observable outcomes.

        <p>Overall, this paper makes three contributions. First, we shed new light on a fundamental impediment to corporate innovation. Specifically, we highlight how the motive to protect existing profits, known to discourage an incumbent's own innovation, can also incentivize powerful incumbents to stifle the innovation of other firms. Second, we document the importance of this obstacle to innovation in the pharmaceutical industry, an innovation-focused industry crucial to consumer and social welfare. Third, we provide new evidence relating to trends and consequences of increasing market concentration. Incumbents in already-concentrated markets further reduce competition by acquiring future product market competitors. We show that such acquisitions often avoid antitrust scrutiny and may therefore pose concerns for consumer welfare.Overall, this paper makes three contributions.

        <p>The prior literature on motives for corporate acquisitions has focused on agency conflicts 6 Protective antitrust policy may have conflicting effects on innovation incentives by raising the profits of new entrants but lowering those of continuing incumbents in settings with continual innovation and "winner-take-all" competition (Segal and Whinston, 2007), even under cooperative entrepreneurial commercialization choices such as licensing or acquisitions (Gans, 2017). Bryan and Hovenkamp (2019a,b) specifically analyze the role of antitrust limits on start-up acquisitions by dominant firms. (Roll, 1986;Morck et al., 1990), synergies (Bena and Li, 2014;Maksimovic and Phillips, 2001), and increasing existing market power (Baker and Bresnahan, 1985). This paper adds to this literature in two ways. First, in our model, acquisitions are not driven by synergies or by incentives to increase current market power. Instead, we argue that incumbents acquire innovative targets to terminate nascent innovation that may threaten their profits in the future. This new mechanism combines two classic effects in the innovation literature: the "replacement effect" (Arrow, 1962), reducing the incentives of an incumbent to introduce new products that are substitutes for existing products, 7 and the "efficiency effect" (Gilbert and Newbery, 1982), giving an incumbent strong incentives to acquire the property rights to a new innovation to preempt entry. 8The prior literature on motives for corporate acquisitions has focused on agency conflicts 6 Protective antitrust policy may have conflicting effects on innovation incentives by raising the profits of new entrants but lowering those of continuing incumbents in settings with continual innovation and "winner-take-all" competition (Segal and Whinston, 2007), even under cooperative entrepreneurial commercialization choices such as licensing or acquisitions (Gans, 2017).

        <p>Second, we focus on the implications of acquisitions and increasing concentration on innovation. Federico et al. (2017Federico et al. ( , 2018)), Motta and Tarantino (2017), Cabral (2017), andGilbert (2018) present theoretical models in which merging parties have diminished innovation incentives and acquisitions can be used to cement the dominance of incumbents. Ornaghi (2009) and Haucap et al. (2019) empirically document an innovation-reducing effect of mergers, whereas Guadalupe et al. (2012) find that a target company's innovation increases following an acquisition by a multinational firm. Our paper provides a theoretical and empirical analysis of a new channel through which acquisitions impact innovation. By using detailed project-level data on acquisition and development decisions, we can rule out other potential explanations for the observed acquisition patterns and the innovation gap between acquired and independent firms. We also contribute to the literature on innovation and competition in the pharmaceutical industry. A number of papers have documented the tradeoffs involved in promoting competition while fostering innovation, through investigating the product market interactions between patented and generic drugs (Caves et al., 1991;Grabowski and Vernon, 1992;Scott Morton, 2000;Reiffen and Ward, 2005), the role of pricing (Howard et al., 2015) and price controls (Filson, 2012), internal R&amp;D policies (Cockburn and Henderson, 1994), and mergers and acquisitions 7 Henderson (1993) and Igami (2017) empirically show that such cannibalization makes incumbents reluctant to innovate in the photolithographic alignment equipment and the hard disk drive manufacturing industries. More broadly, the slow response to new technologies by incumbent firms is explored in the large literature on competition and innovation. See Holmes et al. (2012) and Schmutzler (2013) for unified theoretical treatments and Cohen (2010) for a comprehensive survey.Second, we focus on the implications of acquisitions and increasing concentration on innovation. Federico et al. (2017Federico et al. ( , 2018)), Motta and Tarantino (2017), Cabral (2017), andGilbert (2018) present theoretical models in which merging parties have diminished innovation incentives and acquisitions can be used to cement the dominance of incumbents. Ornaghi (2009) and Haucap et al. (2019) empirically document an innovation-reducing effect of mergers, whereas Guadalupe et al. (2012) find that a target company's innovation increases following an acquisition by a multinational firm. Our paper provides a theoretical and empirical analysis of a new channel through which acquisitions impact innovation.

        <p>We allow for two benefits of innovation: vertical and horizontal differentiation.

We model competition using horizontally and vertically differentiated Bertrand competition because price-setting behavior by firms with differentiated products best captures strategic interactions in the branded drug market (Berndt et al., 2011;Ellison et al., 1997;Duggan and Scott Morton, 2010). 14 We assume that if the project is successfully developed in t = 2, the drug has a product market payoff that depends on the degree of competition (i.e., the number of active firms/products in the market) and product differentiation (i.e., quality and taste differences) in the market. If the project is unsuccessful, the payoff is zero.

First, because of the replacement effect (∆ E &gt; ∆ A ), the entrepreneur is more willing to develop the product. Any form of product market overlap (i.e., substitutability) with the existing drug in the acquirer's portfolio reduces his propensity to continue the development of the acquired project relative to the case in which the project remains independent. Second, the acquirer is more willing to continue if he benefits from important synergies in product development (ρ A &gt; ρ E ). Depending on the relative magnitude of these two effects, either the entrepreneur or the acquirer has a stronger incentive to develop the product.

However, another important aspect of the pharmaceutical industry is competition from undifferentiated generic drugs that enter the market when a branded product's patent expires. Denote the number of years of remaining patent life of the entrepreneur's new project by T E and those of the acquiring incumbent's existing product by T A where T E &gt; T A ≥ 0.

When the acquirer's existing overlapping product has only little remaining patent life (T A close to zero), his development policy for the new project is quite similar to that of the entrepreneur. The intuition for this result is essentially the same as that of Proposition 2.

As we discuss in Section 5, in a more general model, the existence of the acquisition exit option may be valuable enough to increase ex-ante innovation incentives.</p>

        <p>Thus, when incumbent synergies are not too large, acquisitions take place if k ≤ k E and if the efficiency effect is sufficiently large relative to the replacement effect. Even though the entrepreneur has a higher propensity for developing a project (because the replacement effect is stronger than the incumbent synergies), acquisitions occur because they prevent the entrepreneur from reducing the existing profits of the acquirer (efficiency effect). 21Thus, when incumbent synergies are not too large, acquisitions take place if k ≤ k E and if the efficiency effect is sufficiently large relative to the replacement effect. Even though the entrepreneur has a higher propensity for developing a project (because the replacement effect is stronger than the incumbent synergies), acquisitions occur because they prevent the entrepreneur from reducing the existing profits of the acquirer (efficiency effect). 21</p>

        <p>Proposition 4 highlights that either product market overlap or significant development synergies are required for (killer or continuing) acquisitions to occur, immediately implying that 20 Under symmetric (differentiated) Bertrand competition with equal development probabilities, the efficiency effect is always larger than the replacement effect in this region, but this is not necessarily true under Cournot competition. In the latter case, the acquirer can have a lower valuation than the entrepreneur, and therefore the entrepreneur retains the project.Proposition 4 highlights that either product market overlap or significant development synergies are required for (killer or continuing) acquisitions to occur, immediately implying that 20 Under symmetric (differentiated) Bertrand competition with equal development probabilities, the efficiency effect is always larger than the replacement effect in this region, but this is not necessarily true under Cournot competition.

        <p>21 Although the acquirer only has a strictly positive incentive to acquire the entrepreneur when project development is sufficiently profitable (k ≤ k E so ρ∆ E -k is positive), the acquirer has a weaker incentive to develop than the entrepreneur.

        <p>Figure 2 illustrates the two forces driving acquisitions. It plots the acquirer's optimal acquisition strategies as a function of his development capability (ρ A ) and the degree of product overlap (γ). First, when both ρ A and γ are low, the incumbent chooses not to acquire. If he acquires and continues development, he is unlikely to succeed, and acquiring to kill is not worthwhile because his profits are not hurt very much by the successful development of the entrepreneur's project. Second, when ρ A is high and γ is low, the acquirer chooses to continue because developing the project is likely to be successful and does not cannibalize his existing profits very much. Third, when ρ A is low and γ is high, a killer acquisition is optimal because continuing development is likely unsuccessful, but not acquiring the entrepreneur leads to a significant destruction of the acquirer's existing profits. Fourth, when both ρ A and γ are high, either a killer acquisition or acquiring to continue is optimal. Fifth, when γ is very high, the acquirer does not need to acquire the entrepreneur. Even the entrepreneur does not develop the project because competition is too intense.Figure 2 illustrates the two forces driving acquisitions.

        <p>Second, acquiring to continue can occur even when the acquirer is much worse at developing the project than the entrepreneur (ρ A &lt; ρ E ). 22 2.4.2. Multiple Incumbent Acquirers. Our analysis so far made two simplifying assumptions about the acquisition process. First, we assumed that only one of the incumbents is chosen at random to be the potential acquirer of the entrepreneur's project. Second, we assumed that all of the incumbents' existing products are equally differentiated from the entrepreneur's project and all have the same project development capabilities. In Appendix A.3 we relax these 22 Figure 2 shows that under differentiated Bertrand competition, as long as ρ A ≥ ρ E , the acquirer strictly prefers to acquire the entrepreneur if the entrepreneur would otherwise continue development (k E ≥ k), and hence the inequalities (5) and ( 6) are always satisfied. However, these inequalities are not always satisfied under Cournot competition even for ρ A ≥ ρ E because the acquirer may sometimes find it too costly to acquire the entrepreneur, especially when there are many existing incumbents and the products are not very differentiated. This non-acquisition result is closely related to the "Cournot merger paradox" (Salant et al., 1983).Second, acquiring to continue can occur even when the acquirer is much worse at developing the project than the entrepreneur (ρ A &lt; ρ E ). 22 2.4.2.

        <p>First, when several of the n incumbents23 can acquire the entrepreneur, this leads to a situation akin to the "volunteer's dilemma" (Diekmann, 1985) or, more broadly, the costly private provision of a public good (Bliss and Nalebuff, 1984) because all of the incumbents benefit from the acquirer eliminating a future competitor. We show that all pure-strategy equilibria of this acquisition game are essentially identical to the single acquirer case. Moreover, there exists a symmetric mixed-strategy equilibrium in which the entrepreneur is only acquired with some probability because the potential acquirers try to free ride on the privately costly decision to acquire the entrepreneur. Just like in the volunteer's dilemma, when the number of potential bidders increases this free-riding incentive increases. However, in our setting it is counteracted by a second effect. Because any potential acquirer who bids is less likely to be (randomly) chosen as the "winning bidder," the expected cost of bidding decreases. Although the combination of these two effects on each potential acquirer's individual probability to bid is ambiguous, the overall probability of acquisition by at least one of the acquirers unambiguously increases as the number of potential incumbent acquirers increases.First, when several of the n incumbents23 can acquire the entrepreneur, this leads to a situation akin to the "volunteer's dilemma" (Diekmann, 1985) or, more broadly, the costly private provision of a public good (Bliss and Nalebuff, 1984) because all of the incumbents benefit from the acquirer eliminating a future competitor.

        <p>Second, potential acquiring incumbents can differ in overlap and development ability. We show that when potential incumbent acquirers differ in their degree of product differentiation from the entrepreneur's project, a killer acquirer or continuing acquirer will always be the incumbent with the product that is the least differentiated from the entrepreneur's project. This is because the efficiency effect is largest for that acquirer, both in absolute terms and relative to the replacement effect. However, when incumbent acquirers also differ in terms of development capabilities, a continuing acquirer with a more differentiated product, but with a higher development capability, will acquire the project. This happens when his development success probability, and hence his expected gain from developing the entrepreneur's project, is sufficiently high to raise his valuation of the entrepreneurial firm above that of the acquirer with the least differentiated product.Second, potential acquiring incumbents can differ in overlap and development ability.

        <p>To summarize, our theory shows that killer acquisitions arise from the combination of the choice to acquire a particular firm with the intention to terminate and the reduced incentive to develop acquired projects that cannibalize the acquirer's existing profits. As long as the acquirer's development synergies are not too large, our theoretical framework predicts that (i) following an acquisition, overlapping drug projects should be less likely to be developed; when (ii) existing or (iii) future competition is low, this difference in development choices between overlapping acquired drugs and their non-overlapping acquired or non-acquired counterparts should be more pronounced; and (iv) acquisitions by incumbents should target entrepreneurial firms developing drug projects that overlap with the incumbent's existing drugs.To summarize, our theory shows that killer acquisitions arise from the combination of the choice to acquire a particular firm with the intention to terminate and the reduced incentive to develop acquired projects that cannibalize the acquirer's existing profits.

        <p>To empirically document the phenomenon of killer acquisitions, we use the setting of drug development. Testing the predictions of our theoretical framework requires comprehensive data on project-level outcomes for both acquired and non-acquired projects.

        <p>The development of innovative pharmaceutical products, often known as branded or patented drugs, involves a standard set of structured milestones en route to commercialization. First, firms identify potential drug compounds through routine discovery processes. Then, for any promising compounds, firms run preliminary screening in vitro and/or in vivo to explore both efficacy and toxicity before any clinical trials in humans. Following these preclinical evaluations, drugs undergo three phases of clinical trials (Phases I, II, and III). 24 In tandem with these regimented clinical tests, firms engage in additional commercialization activities, including patent filing during the preclinical and/or discovery stage, regulatory filings in the US and abroad, applications for coverage to various public and private insurance agencies, and launching and marketing the product in various countries around the world. Given the lengthy process prior to FDA approval and marketing, patented drugs usually have only a few years post-approval of monopoly profits before patent expiration and generic entry.The development of innovative pharmaceutical products, often known as branded or patented drugs, involves a standard set of structured milestones en route to commercialization.

The merged drug development and acquisition data show active acquisition activities in our analytical sample, with 22 percent of drug projects having an acquisition recorded in our acquisition database. As tabulated in table 1, the rate of acquisition is lower for drugs originated more recently.

        <p>The first main implication of the theoretical framework (building from Proposition 1) is that if the target project overlaps with acquirer projects or products, the acquirer has weaker incentives to continue development. We therefore need a measure of overlap between the target's projects and the acquirer to test for differences in the likelihood of development across overlapping acquired, non-overlapping acquired, and non-acquired projects.The first main implication of the theoretical framework (building from Proposition 1) is that if the target project overlaps with acquirer projects or products, the acquirer has weaker incentives to continue development.

        <p>We measure overlap between a drug project and the acquiring firm based on a combination of its intended therapeutic class and mechanism of action. The therapeutic class (TC) is the disease or condition the therapy targets (e.g., hypertension). We use Pharmaprojects's therapeutic categories, which are based on European Pharmaceutical Market Research Association product categorizations (Kyle, 2007). These categories represent 230 possible TCs. Within each TC, we also identify the drug's mechanism of action (MOA), meaning the biological interaction involved in the drug achieving its desired end, including both the molecular target (e.g., beta adrenoreceptor, angiotensin I converting enzyme) and the intended effect (e.g., agonist, antagonist, reducer, inhibitor). The median number of MOAs per TC in our sample is seven. In our main analyses, we categorize a project as overlapping if the acquiring firm has an existing project or product in the same TC that uses the same MOA as that of the acquired drug project (i.e., treats the same disease or condition in the same way). As outlined in table 1, nearly one quarter of acquired drug projects overlap with their acquirer. We measure competition using this same categorization (i.e., the number of products in the same TC using the same MOA). The mean number of products in a TC-MOA in a given year is 13.We measure overlap between a drug project and the acquiring firm based on a combination of its intended therapeutic class and mechanism of action.

        <p>The logic for measuring overlap narrowly is to ensure that we capture only potential substitute drugs. If we were to instead use same TC regardless of MOA, we would be more likely to capture drugs that complement the target's project, either because they treat different submarkets (i.e., different patient segments with the same disease) or because they are used in parallel in treatment for the same patients. We investigate separately the effects of overlap measured more broadly as the same TC, which we report in supplementary analyses. 29Because we are studying innovative drug development before commercialization, our measure of overlap necessarily differs from measures of competition used in the literature on generic or branded drugs. First, the vast literature that explores generic competition and the effects of generic entry on branded products define competing products as those that are the same chemical entity (Ellison and Ellison, 2011;Arcidiacono et al., 2013;Branstetter et al., 2014).The logic for measuring overlap narrowly is to ensure that we capture only potential substitute drugs. If we were to instead use same TC regardless of MOA, we would be more likely to capture drugs that complement the target's project, either because they treat different submarkets (i.e., different patient segments with the same disease) or because they are used in parallel in treatment for the same patients.

        <p>Second, prior research exploring market competition between branded products has defined overlap as having the same FDA-approved primary indication or using prescription or usage patterns (Howard et al., 2015). However, because we analyze projects under development, many of which are never approved, let alone marketed, we cannot use approval-contingent categories or usage patterns (including, for example, estimated substitution elasticities). Given that we are analyzing premarket products, a big advantage of the pharmaceutical industry context is that categorizations of intended markets and mechanisms are readily available from a project's early stage. Last, some prior research has used the broader measure of the same TC (e.g., Kyle (2007)); we use a narrower measure for the reasons discussed above but include analyses with the broader measure.Second, prior research exploring market competition between branded products has defined overlap as having the same FDA-approved primary indication or using prescription or usage patterns (Howard et al., 2015).

        <p>The term I(Acquired) i ×I(Overlap) i captures the overall development conditions for drugs acquired by overlapping buyers in the years before the acquisition. The key term for our test is the triple interaction term I(Acquired) i ×I(P ost) i,t ×I(Overlap) i , which captures the additional change in development event probability for acquisition cases when the target and the acquirer overlap. Our model predicts a negative coefficient, β, consistent with the prediction that when acquired projects overlap with the acquirer's portfolio, they are more likely to be terminated. 30 Ideally, if terminations were comprehensively reported in a timely manner, we would use a survival analysis to test if and when drugs projects are shut down. However, project terminations are rarely observed or voluntarily reported, either at a specific point in time or at all. 31 Hence, in our main specification, we use a lack of development activity as a proxy for termination. We test for the likelihood of observed, active development of a project using a project-year panel. There are also several advantages to a panel structure that are not possible in a survival analysis, including the ability to account for time-invariant project-level differences between acquired and non-acquired projects and pre-acquisition differences between overlapping and non-overlapping acquired projects. To investigate whether we are accurately capturing 30 It is helpful to examine our empirical strategy through the lens of testing strategic entry-deterrence models in the pharmaceutical industry. Ellison and Ellison (2011) show that investments will be monotonic in market size if entry-deterrence motives are absent but nonmonotonic otherwise. Analogously, in our case, if the incentives to discontinue projects due to potential cannibalization of existing drugs are absent, ceteris paribus, overlapping acquired drug projects should have equal or even higher development rates than non-acquired or non-overlapping acquired ones. This is because only drug candidates that are particularly valuable to an acquirer (e.g., due to synergies resulting from prior experience of developing similar drugs) should be acquired. Thus, in the absence of strategic killing motives, the triple interaction term I(Acquired) i ×I(P ost) i,t ×I(Overlap) i should be positive.

        <p>In column 1, we include project age and vintage fixed effects to focus our estimates on the development of drug projects that are initiated in the same year and at the same stage of development. Vintage fixed effects also account for right truncation for more recently initiated projects, given the long development timelines for pharmaceuticals (US FDA, 2017). In column 1, the estimate of β is -0.037 and statistically significant at the 1 percent level, meaning that acquired drug projects that overlap with the acquirers' portfolio are 3.7 percentage points less likely to have a development event in the years post-acquisition compared to non-overlapping acquired projects, and they are 5.7 percentage points (= 0.037+0.020) less likely to experience a development event compared to non-acquired projects. Given that the unconditional probability of having a development event is 19.9 percent, being acquired by a firm with an overlapping project is associated with a 20.7 percent (=0.037/(0.199-0.020)) lower development probability compared to otherwise similar drugs that are acquired by a non-overlapping acquirer.In column 1, we include project age and vintage fixed effects to focus our estimates on the development of drug projects that are initiated in the same year and at the same stage of development.

For example, Budish et al. (2015) argue that differences in clinical trial lengths and development trajectories arise for different types of cancer treatments caused by varying difficulty of demonstrating effectiveness, which is in turn caused by differences in patient survival rates. Further, within TCs, certain MOAs may be "older," (i.e., more established) which also may lead to differential rates of development across TC-MOAs. These fixed effects ensure we are comparing similar drugs at similar points in the life cycle.In column 2, we include age-TC-MOA fixed effects to control for potential heterogeneities in the development life cycle of drugs targeting different diseases, including differences in the stage and complexity of the underlying science and in the size and geography of patient pools, physician capacity, or patient follow-up times, which can vary greatly across different drug markets (US HHS ASPE, 2014).

        <p>In column 5, we apply propensity score reweighting to the column 4 analyses. Following Guadalupe, Kuzmina and Thomas (2012), this allows us to further account for observable differences in the probability of being acquired. To calculate the propensity score for each firm, we run the following analysis. For each year, we consider firms acquired in that year as treated and firms that are never acquired as control observations. We pool treated and control observations across all years to estimate the probability (or propensity), p, that a firm is acquired as a function of: lagged productivity (total number of development events in the past three years), firm size (the total number of projects under development), drug vintage, a year trend, and TC-MOA fixed effects. We then transform p into weights (weighting each treated firm by 1/p and each control firm by 1/(1-p)), and restrict the analysis to firms that fall within the common support. 32 The propensity score reweighting estimator allows us to control for selection stemming from both time-invariant characteristics of firms (as in the equal-weighted fixed effects regression) and time-varying characteristics. 33 Our core results are robust to the propensity score reweighting.In column 5, we apply propensity score reweighting to the column 4 analyses.

        <p>In column 6, we explore if there are any differences in drug development trajectories across projects acquired by overlapping versus non-overlapping incumbents. Given that we find decreased development post-acquisition for overlapping acquired projects, one concern is that such projects were on a slower (or faster) development path pre-acquisition compared to other acquired projects, and such pre-acquisition differences at least partially explain post-acquisition differences. To investigate this, we include indicator variables for the three years before the acquisition separating overlapping and non-overlapping acquired. The associated estimated coefficients are insignificant, suggesting that different development trajectories are not driving our results.In column 6, we explore if there are any differences in drug development trajectories across projects acquired by overlapping versus non-overlapping incumbents.

        <p>One reason for this pattern could be that our measure of overlap (same TC and same MOA) leads to potentially overly tight market definitions, and therefore even some non-overlapping acquisitions may actually be killer acquisitions (i.e., substitute projects that are acquired and terminated). To investigate this, we separated out projects that overlap in TC only, and found the omitted category of non-overlapping acquired projects now is consistently insignificant, albeit still negative (Appendix table F1). 34 32 Figure F2 shows similar propensity distributions for acquired and non-acquired projects post-weighting. 33 The underlying assumption in the estimation is that, conditional on observable time-invariant and time-varying characteristics, differences in outcomes are attributable only to being acquired by an overlapping incumbent (typically referred to as the ignorability assumption, or selection on observables). Busso, DiNardo and McCrary (2014) show that the finite sample properties of this propensity score reweighting estimator are superior to propensity score matching techniques (where each treated firm is matched to one or several controls). 34 The prior literature does not provide a clear expectation for the sign of this coefficient.

However, a negative coefficient is consistent with faster termination and lower development rates of larger (acquiring) firms due to the absence of private benefits from continuing development (Guedj and Scharfstein, 2004) or due to agency problems inherent in the organization of large firms (Seru, 2014).Table 3 includes these additional analyses.

        <p>A higher propensity to undertake overlapping acquisitions does not isolate a strategic killer acquisition motive on its own. However, alternative theories of corporate acquisition and development cannot explain both our acquisition and drug development results. First, in contrast to our empirical finding of acquisitions of overlapping targets, acquisition motives based on empire building or managerial risk diversification theories would imply that incumbent acquirers should target non-overlapping projects. Second, although our results showing that overlap predicts acquisitions are, on their own, consistent with acquisitions motivated by project development synergies, such a synergy-based theory would predict that acquired overlapping projects are subsequently more likely to be developed rather than less. Hence, a synergy motive contrasts sharply with our empirical findings of decreased development in Section 4.2.A higher propensity to undertake overlapping acquisitions does not isolate a strategic killer acquisition motive on its own.

As a result, reportability under the act changes from year to year as the statutory thresholds adjust. Under HSR, deals with a target valuation under $50 million (all amounts referenced here are annually adjusted) are not required to submit filings for premerger review. For deals between $50 million and $200 million, the size-of-the-person test is conducted: if the larger party has less than $100 million in assets or sales or the smaller party has less than $10 million in assets, the deal does not need to be reviewed by the FTC. Because in the pharmaceutical industry the size-of-the-person test is typically not satisfied for the smaller (target) party, acquisitions below $200 million will usually not be investigated. Wollmann (2019) shows that these review exemptions can result in stealth consolidation: anticompetitive acquisitions whose small size enables them to escape regulatory scrutiny but whose cumulative effect is large.Specifically, we examine acquisitions around the HSR review threshold and compare the project development decisions for transactions just above and below the threshold.

        <p>However, one might reasonably expect that part of the observed decrease in success rates for acquisitions that are a few millions of dollars smaller is explained by a positive relationship between deal values and eventual development success. We therefore examine the difference in development rates around an HSR "pseudo threshold." To compare with the real HSR threshold (an annually adjusted value set using a base of $200 million in 2000), we construct a pseudo threshold (2000 base value of $150 million). This pseudo threshold is comparable in value to the real threshold but is sufficiently different such that we should not observe strategic behavior in its vicinity. The results of this analysis (lower panel of table 7) suggest that small differences in deal value do not produce significant development differences except when they occur at the real HSR threshold. Furthermore, they are not sensitive to the particular pseudo threshold we choose and are therefore consistent with the idea that acquirers conduct more killer acquisitions in situations in which they can expect to avoid FTC scrutiny.However, one might reasonably expect that part of the observed decrease in success rates for acquisitions that are a few millions of dollars smaller is explained by a positive relationship between deal values and eventual development success.

In fact, their average patenting quantity drops by 30 percent from 4.57 to 3.16 patents over the five years post-acquisition.

        <p>Our prior analyses provide some evidence that salvage acquisitions are unlikely to explain our results. First, the development rate of otherwise similar drugs does not differ significantly pre-acquisition (in table 2, column 6), and second, we do not find evidence that the overlapping acquired drugs' technology is more likely to be redeployed (in table 8).Our prior analyses provide some evidence that salvage acquisitions are unlikely to explain our results.

        <p>To directly investigate the salvage acquisition explanation, we compared reported acquisition values across overlapping and non-overlapping acquisitions. A salvage acquisition explanation would predict relatively low valuations for overlapping acquisitions. Alternatively, killer acquisitions should involve paying fair value, and hence we should expect no difference. To perform this analysis, we collected additional information on the value of each acquisition from SDC Platinum and RecapIQ. One note of caution is this is a selected sample of acquisitions, as it is conditional on the availability of deal value information.To directly investigate the salvage acquisition explanation, we compared reported acquisition values across overlapping and non-overlapping acquisitions.

        <p>39 One word of caution about these results is that we cannot directly link target firm patents to a specific drug project because of their early stage. Relevant patents at the drug level are typically disclosed late in drug development when required by the FDA. Further, patents linked at a product level are available systematically in the FDA Orange Book only for approved drugs. As a result, we cannot identify whether inventors are associated with notyet-approved projects that are shut down. However, if we focus on single-drug targets, we find that an even larger proportion of inventors leave the combined firm after the acquisition (although the sample becomes quite small).39 One word of caution about these results is that we cannot directly link target firm patents to a specific drug project because of their early stage.

        <p>Our findings on differential project development allow us to roughly calculate the pervasiveness of killer acquisitions as well as their impact on industry-wide development decisions. 40 In our main analyses, we show that when an acquired project overlaps with a product in the acquirer's existing product portfolio, the project is less likely to be continued. The unconditional probability of having a development event is 19.9 percent. Using the estimates from our tightest specification reported in table 2, column 4, we find that acquired projects with overlap (22.7 percent of acquired projects) continue at an adjusted rate of 13.4 percent, while acquired projects without overlap (77.3 percent of acquired projects) continue development at an adjusted rate of 17.5 percent.Our findings on differential project development allow us to roughly calculate the pervasiveness of killer acquisitions as well as their impact on industry-wide development decisions. 40 In our main analyses, we show that when an acquired project overlaps with a product in the acquirer's existing product portfolio, the project is less likely to be continued.

        <p>To roughly calculate the number of killer acquisitions, we assume that there are two types of acquisitions that fall into the acquired overlapping category: killer acquisitions that are purely intended to shut down future competitors (and thus have a 0 percent probability of development) and acquisitions that have the same development likelihood as acquisitions without overlap (17.5 percent). Given these assumptions and estimates, what would the fraction ν of pure killer acquisitions among transactions with overlap have to be to result in the lower development of acquisitions with overlap (13.4 percent)? Specifically, we solve the equation 13.4% = ν ×0+(1-ν)×17.5% for ν which yields ν = 23.4%. Therefore, we estimate that 5.3% (= ν × 22.7%) of all acquisitions, or about 46 (= 5.3% × 856) acquisitions every year, are killer acquisitions. If instead we assume the non-killer acquisitions to have the same development likelihood as non-acquired projects (19.9 percent), we estimate that 7.4 percent of acquisitions, or 63 per year, are killer acquisitions.To roughly calculate the number of killer acquisitions, we assume that there are two types of acquisitions that fall into the acquired overlapping category: killer acquisitions that are purely intended to shut down future competitors (and thus have a 0 percent probability of development) and acquisitions that have the same development likelihood as acquisitions without overlap (17.5 percent).

        <p>Alternatively, we can estimate the number of killer acquisitions by using the results of table 3. Specifically, we find that the share of acquired projects for which no positive development event is observed after acquisition is 14.9 percentage points higher for overlapping acquired projects than for non-overlapping acquired projects. If this higher share of projects that are never developed is due to killer acquisitions, it implies a minimum of 29 (= 14.9%×22.7%×856) killer acquisitions per year.Alternatively, we can estimate the number of killer acquisitions by using the results of table 3.

        <p>Another benchmark for understanding the frequency of killer acquisitions is the share of drug projects that actually are at risk of being the target of a killer acquisition. We first define and identify the risk set. It comprises those drug projects that potential acquirers would plausibly want to acquire to kill that come from plausibly acquirable targets. Thus, we define the killer acquisition risk set as all "follow-on" drugs initiated by "new" firms. We define follow-on drugs as the second (or later) drug project initiated in a TC-MOA category. Such drugs constitute 70 percent of our total sample. We then identify those follow-on drugs that are initiated by firms that are plausible acquisition targets (i.e., new firms) using three different categorizations: (1) firms with no prior projects, (2) firms with no prior projects in the TC, and (3) firms with no prior projects in the TC-MOA. In our data, the corresponding share of follow-on drugs are 35 percent, 66 percent, and 84 percent, respectively. Using those numbers as an estimate of the risk set of potential killer acquisition targets, and using an estimate of 1.5 percent of all drugs-including those not at risk-as killer acquisitions,41 we estimate that 6.3 percent/ 3.3 percent/ 2.6 percent of potential killer acquisition targets are acquired to kill.Another benchmark for understanding the frequency of killer acquisitions is the share of drug projects that actually are at risk of being the target of a killer acquisition.

        <p>These back-of-the-envelope calculations provide a lower bound for the actual number of killer acquisitions, as they assume killer acquisitions lead to immediate termination and that there are no additional synergies in the development of overlapping drugs. If pure killer acquisitions had a smaller, but positive, likelihood of development, the implied fraction ν of killer acquisitions would have to be even higher to be consistent with our empirical results. Similarly, if there are synergies in the development of overlapping drugs, they would provide a countervailing positive force that masks the observed negative effects on the development of acquired projects with overlap.These back-of-the-envelope calculations provide a lower bound for the actual number of killer acquisitions, as they assume killer acquisitions lead to immediate termination and that there are no additional synergies in the development of overlapping drugs.

        <p>How would overall development rates in the pharmaceutical industry be affected if antitrust policy directly targeted killer acquisitions? The average development probability in our sample is 18.2 percent. Consider first the case in which acquisitions of overlapping projects are no longer allowed and that all such projects instead have the same development probability (19.9 percent) as non-acquired projects (47.5 percent of all projects).

        <p>We can compare them to estimates of the effects of targeted innovation policies in the pharmaceutical industry. One policy-considered successful but also very costly-is the Orphan Drug Act which focused on encouraging the development of drugs for conditions with small patient pools (i.e., "orphan" diseases) by giving firms substantial tax breaks on clinical trials (up to $30 million per trial), grants, and extended market exclusivity. Economic analysis by Yin (2008Yin ( , 2009) ) suggests the policy resulted in roughly 25 more clinical trials per year from 1981 to 1994, with the effect attenuating over time. Eliminating killer acquisitions would result in innovation effects that are, at a lower bound, as large as half of the size of the Orphan Drug Act.We can compare them to estimates of the effects of targeted innovation policies in the pharmaceutical industry.

        <p>It is also instructive to compare killer acquisitions to reverse payment patent settlements ("pay-for-delay"), a common and related phenomenon in the pharmaceutical industry whereby incumbents pay to temporarily thwart the entry of generic competitors. 42 Helland and Seabury (2016) estimate that over the next 25 years, pay-for-delay settlements in pharmaceuticals will generate a deadweight loss of at least $21 billion. Although our analysis does not allow us to compute similar welfare estimates, we believe that killer acquisitions likely cause at least as much anticompetitive harm as pay-for-delay settlements. The FTC reports that in the period from 2004 to 2016, there were between 10 and 20 pay-for-delay settlements per year: 20 if one counts any patent infringement settlement that includes restriction on generic entry and some non-zero payment and only 13 if one excludes cases where the payment was solely for litigation costs above $7 million. In contrast, our analyses suggest that during approximately the same time frame there were 46-63 killer acquisitions per year.It is also instructive to compare killer acquisitions to reverse payment patent settlements ("pay-for-delay"), a common and related phenomenon in the pharmaceutical industry whereby incumbents pay to temporarily thwart the entry of generic competitors. 42 Helland and Seabury (2016) estimate that over the next 25 years, pay-for-delay settlements in pharmaceuticals will generate a deadweight loss of at least $21 billion.

        <p>Our theoretical and empirical analysis focuses on the acquisition and project development incentives of incumbents and entrepreneurs. Killer acquisitions have an unambiguously negative effect on consumer surplus if, as in our model, they leave the ex-ante incentives to originate projects unaffected. Both the entrepreneur and the acquiring incumbent, as well as all of the other incumbents, are better off when such acquisitions are allowed. But consumers are hurt both by the lack of competition and the elimination of innovative new products. In other words, patients suffer because there are fewer drugs and the drugs that are developed and brought to market are sold at higher prices. 43 A comprehensive welfare analysis of the impact of killer acquisitions is, however, much more difficult given the many different forces involved in the innovation process. In particular, such an analysis would have to quantify the impact on patient mortality, consumer surplus, technological spillovers from innovation, and ex-ante incentives to generate new ideas. As a result, a formal welfare analysis is well beyond the scope of this paper, but two points are worthy of discussion.Our theoretical and empirical analysis focuses on the acquisition and project development incentives of incumbents and entrepreneurs.

        <p>The presence of an acquisition channel may have a countervailing positive effect on welfare if the prospect of entrepreneurial exit through acquisition (by an incumbent) spurs ex-ante innovation as in Phillips and Zhdanov (2013) and Letina et al. (2020). In our model, entrepreneurs are born with a project and thus do not have to exert effort to come up with an idea, but it is plausible that the prospect of later acquisition may motivate the origination of entrepreneurial ideas. Yet, killer acquisitions will motivate such idea origination only if the entrepreneur receives some of the surplus that accrues to the incumbent through the acquisition. If the entrepreneur is left with no surplus relative to the standalone value of her project, she will not increase her innovation efforts. If, on the other hand, killer acquisitions do increase ex-ante innovation, this potential welfare gain will have to be weighed against the ex-post efficiency loss due to reduced competition. Whether the former positive or the latter negative effect dominates will depend on the elasticity of the entrepreneur's innovation response.The presence of an acquisition channel may have a countervailing positive effect on welfare if the prospect of entrepreneurial exit through acquisition (by an incumbent) spurs ex-ante innovation as in Phillips and Zhdanov (2013) and Letina et al.

        <p>Furthermore, acquisitions may affect the direction of innovation. If entrepreneurs can choose between originating projects that overlap with existing products or those that do not, increased takeover activity and killer acquisitions by incumbents may spur innovation of very similar me-too drugs (Garattini, 1997;Arcidiacono et al., 2013) at the expense of the origination of 43 Although killer acquisitions reduce consumer surplus, they need not reduce social surplus under a welfare standard that weights consumer surplus and producer surplus equally. This can occur if the entrepreneur's product partly duplicates development costs but does not provide a sufficiently large increase in consumer surplus to fully compensate the loss in producer surplus of the existing incumbents as in Mankiw and Whinston (1986). In Appendix A we derive a sufficient condition under which the loss in consumer surplus resulting from killer acquisitions outweighs the producer surplus gains and thus reduces social welfare overall. As long as there are few existing incumbents and the entrepreneur's drug project is not too similar to the incumbents' existing drugs, killer acquisitions reduce not only consumer surplus but also total welfare. Put differently, killer acquisitions of "me-too" drugs (drugs that are very close substitutes) in markets in which there is more than a single incumbent need not be welfare-reducing because they destroy producer surplus of existing incumbents by more than they increase consumer surplus. However, as we show in Appendix A, it is precisely in cases in which killer acquisitions do not harm welfare that they are also unlikely to take place. truly novel products. 44 This distortion of the direction of innovation in response to the prospect of acquisition will add to the negative welfare impact of killer acquisitions. 45Given these competing forces the overall effect of killer acquisitions on ex-ante innovation (and, therefore, welfare) remains unclear. However, based on our analysis we think it unlikely that this acquisition channel, which generates significant ex-post inefficiencies resulting from the protection of market power, is the most effective way to spur ex-ante innovation. In fact, we document a positive reinforcement loop of competition: because killer acquisitions are less likely to occur when incumbents face significant existing competition, raising the level of existing competition not only has well-known immediate benefits for social welfare, but it also deters incumbents from engaging in killer acquisitions of future competitors, thus increasing future competition and further deterring killer acquisitions.Furthermore, acquisitions may affect the direction of innovation.

        <p>In this paper, we document that incumbent firms acquire innovative targets and terminate their innovative projects in order to preempt future competition. Empirically, we exploit the setting of drug development, in which we are able to track project development before and after acquisitions. Consistent with the killer acquisitions motive, we show that incumbents acquire firms with overlapping drug projects and that overlapping acquired drugs are less likely to be developed, particularly when the acquirer has strong incentives to protect his existing market power.In this paper, we document that incumbent firms acquire innovative targets and terminate their innovative projects in order to preempt future competition.

        <p>Although our analyses focus on the pharmaceutical sector, the core insights extend beyond that specific setting. Acquisitions are the primary form of start-up exit and have become increasingly popular as an exit strategy over time across various industries, suggesting that the potentially damaging consequences reach beyond pharmaceuticals. 46 Our results caution against interpreting acquisitions of nascent technologies solely as incumbents' efforts to integrate and foster entrepreneurial innovation. Instead, a substantial part of what is fueling this trend may actually be killer acquisitions that potentially harm innovation and competition. In particular, the large number of acquisitions of small entrepreneurial start-ups by large incumbents in the tech sector would suggest a fruitful opportunity for investigating whether killer acquisitions extend beyond the pharmaceutical industry. However, the lack of strong intellectual property protection afforded by drug patents, the importance of acquiring and retaining valuable human capital, and the relative data scarcity poses new challenges for any future theoretical or empirical analysis. 47 Our results also suggest that antitrust policy should continue to closely scrutinize the impact of acquisitions on corporate innovation, in particular when such acquisitions plausibly prevent the development of future competing products and technologies. The fact that killer acquisitions appear to routinely avoid regulatory scrutiny by acquiring entrepreneurial ventures at transaction values below the HSR review thresholds exacerbates the concern.Although our analyses focus on the pharmaceutical sector, the core insights extend beyond that specific setting.

        <p>Finally, the magnitude of the Schumpeterian gale of creative destruction-whereby start-ups' inventions topple entrenched and less innovative incumbents-may be smaller than previously documented. Innovation and the share of young firms in economic activity may have declined (Akcigit and Ates, 2019) not only because incumbents are more reluctant to innovate but also because incumbent firms with market power acquire innovators to eliminate future competition and thereby inhibit technological progress. 47 A first attempt in quantifying potential adverse effects of acquisitions by tech giants on start-up innovation is by Kamepalli et al. (2019), who theoretically and empirically study "kill zones" in which new tech ventures are no longer worth funding after the acquisition of an entrant. However, Cabral (2019) cautions that a regulatory tightening of merger policy in the high-tech space could also lead to a significant discouragement effect on innovation.

This is positive in the killer acquisitions region k E ≥ k &gt; k A . The second term is the expected increase in consumer surplus due to continued development, which is also positive both because there is more product variety and prices are lower. The term on the right-hand side of the inequality is the expected loss in profit for the n incumbents, and it is also positive. We can derive a sufficient condition for killer acquisitions to be welfare-reducing by setting the first term to zero (i.e., k = k E so the entrepreneur is indifferent between developing and not developing). This yields the following condition:The first term in parentheses on the left-hand side is the entrepreneur's net expected profit gain from continuing development.

        <p>A.3.1. Multiple Potential Acquirers. In the baseline version of our model we assume that one of the n incumbents is chosen at random to be the potential acquirer of the entrepreneur's project. Assume the development cost k is in the region in which killer acquisitions can occur in the case of a single bidder, k E &gt; k &gt; k A , and that ρ E (π A acq,F -π A ¬acq,S ) ≥ ρ E ∆ E -k-L such that an acquirer acquires the entrepreneur (and does not develop the project). The acquirer has to pay the acquisition price P = ρ E ∆ E -k (i.e., at least the entrant's expected profits under competition), but the benefits from eliminating a new competitor are diffuse and also accrue to the other incumbent. In particular, the acquirer earns π A acq,F +L-P , while all the other n-1 incumbents earn π A acq,F &gt; π A acq,F + L -P because for k E &gt; k &gt; k A , we have ρ E ∆ E -k &gt; L. This leads to a potential free-riding problem known as the "volunteer's dilemma" (Diekmann, 1985) or, more broadly, to the problem of costly private provision of a public good (Bliss and Nalebuff, 1984).A.3.1.

        <p>Let us now assume that n b ≤ n incumbents can acquire the entrepreneur. 48 It is never optimal for any of the n b bidders to bid any price other than P = ρ E ∆ E -k because paying a higher price reduces the bidder's profits and bidding less means that the entrepreneur would reject the bid. First, there are therefore multiple pure-strategy equilibria in which one of the n b incumbents bids P = ρ E ∆ E -k, all the other incumbents do not bid, and the bidding incumbent acquires the entrepreneur. All these pure-strategy equilibria are essentially identical to the single bidder case analyzed in our baseline model. Second, for n b ≥ 2 there exists a mixed-strategy equilibrium in which each of the n b bidders chooses to bid P = ρ E ∆ E -k with probability p and to not make any bid with probability 1-p.

        <p>This equation defines the individual equilibrium mixing probability p. It has a very intuitive interpretation. As in the single acquirer case, the main driving force is the ratio of the replacement effect (ρ E ∆ E -k-L) to the efficiency effect (ρ E (π A ¬acq,F -π A ¬acq,S )). The larger the efficiency effect relative to the replacement effect is, the more likely an acquirer is to make an acquisition bid for the entrepreneur. This is essentially the same as the inequality in (5), which requires that the ratio of ρ E ∆ E -k-L (replacement effect) to ρ E (π A ¬acq,F -π A ¬acq,S ) (efficiency effect) is smaller than one.This equation defines the individual equilibrium mixing probability p.

        <p>In addition, the number of potential acquirers n b also plays a crucial role now. There are two forces at work here that work in opposite directions. First, as the number of potential bidders increases, the incentive to free ride on another bidder's bid (and killer acquisition) increases. This can be seen by looking at the exponent 1 n b -1 on the right-hand side of the equation that reduces the right-hand side because the term inside the brackets is positive and strictly smaller than one. This is the familiar free-riding effect in the volunteer's dilemma. Second, as the number of potential acquirers increases, the expected payment that an acquirer has to make when he decides to make a bid decreases. This occurs because he is less likely to be chosen as the "winning bidder" who has to pay the acquisition price to the entrepreneur. 49 The term inside the summation on the right-hand side captures this effect; it decreases with n b and thus raises the probability that a potential acquirer will make a bid for the entrepreneur.In addition, the number of potential acquirers n b also plays a crucial role now.

        <p>The replacement effect is the same for all the acquirers because they all shut down the project upon acquisition. The efficiency effect, however, is largest for the potential acquirer A i with the product that is the least differentiated from the entrepreneur's project (i.e., the highest γ A i E ). To see this, note that in case of a killer acquisition, all incumbents earn the same profit π A i acq,F = π acq,F . If the killer acquisition does not occur and the entrepreneur successfully develops the project, π A i ¬acq,S will be the lowest profit for the incumbent with the least degree of differentiation from the entrepreneur. Thus, the incumbent with the most closely related product to the entrepreneur's project will have the highest valuation to acquire it. Importantly, this result holds even if potential acquirers differ in their development capabilities ρ A i because none of the potential acquirers would want to continue the project.The replacement effect is the same for all the acquirers because they all shut down the project upon acquisition.

        <p>Proof of Proposition 3. After T A years, the patent on the incumbent's existing product expires and generic undifferentiated entry for this product occurs. Due to undifferentiated Bertrand competition, profits of the acquirer's existing product drop to zero after T A .

        <p>Denote the per-period development gains of the new product for the entrepreneur and the acquirer in the presence of generic competition for the acquirer's existing product by ∆ E gen and ∆ A gen . First, these development gains are smaller than the previous expressions, ∆ E gen &lt; ∆ E and ∆ A gen &lt; ∆ A . When a generic product that is undifferentiated from the acquirer's existing product enters, it not only drives profits of that existing product to zero, but it also reduces the profits lap is greater on the efficiency effect than on the replacement effect. Thus, the potential acquirer with the largest product overlap generally has the strongest incentive to acquire the entrepreneur if potential acquirers only differ in the degree of product differentiation from the entrepreneur.Denote the per-period development gains of the new product for the entrepreneur and the acquirer in the presence of generic competition for the acquirer's existing product by ∆ E gen and ∆ A gen .

        <p>To do so, we make use of two additional fields in the dataset. The first is the "overview" field, which intends to provide a background of the drug project and thus often includes the name of the original firm associated with the project in the case of acquisitions. For example, the drug Trastuzumab had the originator as "Roche" when it was initially developed by Genentech. The overview text reads "Trastuzumab is a humanized MAb to HER2, a cell surface oncoprotein which is overproduced in breast and ovarian cancers, under development by Genentech (Roche)," and hence we could use this information to extract the original originator as Genentech.To do so, we make use of two additional fields in the dataset.

        <p>To extract the original originator firm from these fields, we used regular expressions and phrases such as "X acquired by Y" or "developed by X."

        <p>Once we had a dependable measure of the true originator firms, our second challenge in using Pharmaprojects was to standardize originator firm names for matching with other datasets, including M&amp;A events. We did so first by using the 
            <rs type="software">Stata</rs> program "stnd compname" (Wasi and Flaaen, 2015), which isolated the stem name for each originator firm associated with each project in Pharmaprojects. We then checked all non-exact matching manually to confirm accuracy.

        <p>Pharmaprojects comprehensively documents the occurrence and timing of key product development milestones (e.g., "new patent application," "target identified," "first launch," and "additional registration for clinical trial"), including drug discontinuations. We aggregate the 28 events tracked by Pharmaprojects into three categories: development activities and events, termination events, and neutral events that impart little information regarding the progress (or termination) of drug development. Development events reflect both scientific milestones and important steps in the commercialization process for the underlying drug project.Pharmaprojects comprehensively documents the occurrence and timing of key product development milestones (e.g., "new patent application," "target identified," "first launch," and "additional registration for clinical trial"), including drug discontinuations.

        <p>Examining the patterns in development events and activities over the life cycle of active drug projects, we see that commercialization-related activity increases as a share of development activity over time (see table "Share of Development Events, by Project Age"). Therefore capturing such activities over and above clinical trial progress is especially important for inferring post-acquisition development activity.Examining the patterns in development events and activities over the life cycle of active drug projects, we see that commercialization-related activity increases as a share of development activity over time (see table "Share of Development Events, by Project Age").

        <p>In addition to our main results using development milestones, we also run supplementary analysis using progression through phases of clinical trials as the dependent variable, which involves supplementing the Pharmaprojects data with Pharma Intelligence's Trialtrove data on clinical trials, linked at the project level.

        <p>This table presents a list of events recorded in Pharmaprojects to track the development process of each drug. The events are listed in alphabetical order. Each of these events is coded into one of the three categories: development events, discontinuation events, and neutral events with little information regarding drug development progress (denoted as "-" in the table).This table presents a list of events recorded in Pharmaprojects to track the development process of each drug.

        <p>We collect acquisition data from three sources. We first extract all announced and completed M&amp;As (with complete information on acquirer and target firms) and announced and effective dates from Thomson Reuters SDC Platinum. To supplement the SDC M&amp;A data, we use Thomson Reuters RecapIQ (now Cortellis Deals Intelligence) data. RecapIQ documents deals in the biotechnology industry using information from company press releases, SEC filings, and company voluntary disclosures. Our third source of acquisition data is the SDC VentureXpert database, which covers mainly VC-backed, early stage start-ups. Using VentureXpert, we identify entrepreneurial companies that exited via an acquisition. However, since VentureXpert does not provide details on the acquirer and acquisition dates, we manually collect that information.We collect acquisition data from three sources.

        <p>Armed with acquisition events compiled from multiple data sources, we then conduct a multistep cleaning process to ensure acquisition events are correctly linked to target and acquirer firms. We first standardize company names (for both acquirers and targets) and collect demographic information for each company. Second, since the same firm could appear in different databases under slightly different names, we create a unique firm identifier by grouping firms with highly similar standardized names and identical demographic characteristics (such as location). Third, using cleaned names of acquirers and targets and deal dates, we drop duplicate acquisition events (which appear possibly due to using multiple datasets). To the best of our knowledge, this combination provides the most comprehensive database on acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry. 50Armed with acquisition events compiled from multiple data sources, we then conduct a multistep cleaning process to ensure acquisition events are correctly linked to target and acquirer firms.

        <p>We combine our acquisition database with the Pharmaprojects drug development data through a fuzzy matching algorithm combined with manual check. We consider a drug project acquired if the originator firm is acquired. In the end, for each drug in our database, we can identify whether it went through any acquisition event during its development life cycle and if it did, the acquirer, the timing of acquisition, and development activity in the years pre-and post-acquisition.We combine our acquisition database with the Pharmaprojects drug development data through a fuzzy matching algorithm combined with manual check.

        <p>The merged drug development and acquisition data show active acquisition activities in our analytical sample, with 22 percent of drug projects having an acquisition recorded in our acquisition databases. As tabulated in table 1, the rate of acquisition is lower for drugs 50 Each of the three data sources, SDC M&amp;A Database, RecapIQ, and VentureXpert, independently contributes at least 10 percent of cases in the final database. A20 originated more recently. This pattern is likely because acquisitions often occur several years into drug development, and for more recent projects, some acquisitions may have not yet been realized at the time of data construction (i.e., right truncation) to alleviate concerns that our main results are driven by differences in the stage of development across projects that might remain even after including various age, project, TC-MOA, and firmrelated fixed effects. We treat the clinical trial analysis as supplementary evidence because our main analyses include a larger sample of projects and additional key development events besides trial starts (e.g., patent applications) and the panel structure allows for project-level fixed effects.The merged drug development and acquisition data show active acquisition activities in our analytical sample, with 22 percent of drug projects having an acquisition recorded in our acquisition databases.

        <p>In this analysis, we focus on the subsample of drugs that start Phase I clinical trials and are subsequently acquired and on projects started before 2011. We do this to ensure there is sufficient time to observe an acquisition and to give the analyzed projects enough time to enter Phase II trials. Using the following specification, we test whether drug projects acquired by firms with overlapping products are less likely to start Phase II trials than drug projects acquired by non-overlapping incumbents:In this analysis, we focus on the subsample of drugs that start Phase I clinical trials and are subsequently acquired and on projects started before 2011.

        <p>Table E1 presents the clinical trial regression results. We find that projects acquired by firms with overlapping products are 9.0 percentage points less likely to progress to Phase II than non-overlapping acquired projects (column 1). In terms of economic magnitude, this represents a decrease of 23.7 percent from the base rate of starting Phase II for acquired projects of 38 percent. Or, put in terms of project termination, 62 percent of non-overlapping acquired projects are stopped before starting Phase II versus 71 percent of overlapping acquired projects.Table E1 presents the clinical trial regression results.
