        <p>Business model architectures in the car industry are gaining increased attention from scientists and policymakers. Although scientific studies have been conducted to address the pressures faced by future business models to change, no research has examined the bibliometric variables in this area. This study aims to fill the gap by conducting a bibliometric analysis of 104 articles on business models for electric cars. The analysis showed that the literature on business models for electric cars is exhaustive, and it focuses on business model decisions for charging technologies, driver services, electricity management, commercial contracts, and plant. China, the United States of America, and Germany have conducted the maximum number of studies on the aforementioned theme. The topic dendrogram identified two evolving strands of discussionsdinnovative technologies and resource optimization and electricity management systems and product life cycle. These findings can guide the formulation of environmentally sustainable policies for electric car manufacturing and help car manufacturers to restructure their models.Business model architectures in the car industry are gaining increased attention from scientists and policymakers.

        <p>The automotive industry is stepping into a new era with electric cars. They have returned to the market in response to the need for mitigating increased carbon dioxide emissions (CO 2 ) resulting from transportation (Kley et al., 2011a,b). Increased environmental awareness has prompted leading car manufacturers to produce hybrid and electric cars to replace the previous internal combustion engines. Nowadays, the economic sustainability of electric vehicles depends on their business models. Therefore, scientific research on and subsequent large-scale application of these business models are critical to influencing electric car purchase decisions.The automotive industry is stepping into a new era with electric cars.

        <p>Over time, there have been several definitions of business models. Chesbrough (2010) and Osterwalder et al. (2005) define it as means of how companies create value through their products and services and how they deliver and capture it. Other definitions consider business models as a representation of how a company operates (Magretta, 2002); Teece (2010) defines them as the organizational and financial architecture of a business. Matzen et al. (2005) focus on how business models can increase consumer benefits through more innovative offers.Over time, there have been several definitions of business models.

        <p>Recently, the business models of companies are focusing on sustainability (Czinkota et al., 2018). In this regard, Nielsen and Morten (2015) define a business model as a sustainable way of doing business.Recently, the business models of companies are focusing on sustainability (Czinkota et al., 2018).

        <p>The aforementioned studies and case studies have explained empirical evidence associated with the business models of electric cars. However, as stated by Casadesus-Masanell and Ricart (2011), 'The success or failure of a company's business model depends largely on how it interacts with models of other players in the industry'. However, the aforementioned studies have not examined the bibliometric variables, based on the context set by Casadesus-Masanell and Ricart (2011). The use of bibliometrics facilitates an identification of the essential quantitative variables of a particular research stream (Junquera and Mitre, 2007). This method allows determining necessary information about a specific research topic, including authors in the field, the number of publications, keywords allowing an interaction between variables (policies, assets, and governance), and countries' data (Casadesus-Masanell and Ricart, 2011). It also allows an implementation of the science mapping techniques (Aria and Cuccurullo, 2017). This study conducted the bibliometrics analysis by using the bibliometrix Rpackage (Aria and Cuccurullo, 2017). Additionally, biblioshiny, a shiny app providing a web-interface for bibliometrix, was used for creating the topic dendrogram, a conceptual map, and a trend topic figure. Moreover, to identify the most active geographies for this research area, we determined the main keywords using a conceptual chart; this helped us to identify more specific research fields and view and read the most cited papers in this domain.The aforementioned studies and case studies have explained empirical evidence associated with the business models of electric cars.

        <p>First, the study defined the three research questions. Subsequently, business model and electric cars were selected as the primary keywords from the Scopus database. According to Chen and Xiao (2016), keywords can be selected by using the publication keywords from a high level and by using the essential keywords that identify a large search domain and their relationship at the micro-level. This study adopts the second technique. A search for the keyword business model returned 338,781 results on Scopus; subsequently, researchers aimed to visualize the knowledge structure on a microdomain with the keywords electric cars (236 results on Scopus). This keyword search indicates a disintegrated set of interdisciplinary studies on business models for electric cars creates, and calls for systematising the related literature (Table 1).First, the study defined the three research questions.

        <p>Until date, the bibliometric analyses on the subject have focused on the engineering aspects of the electric car (Hu et al., 2014;Zhao et al., 2018); however, numerous studies consider other elements such as electric car's energy management (Zhang et al., 2015), charging systems (Globisch et al., 2019;Wu, 2019), sustainable models linked to sharing economy contracts (Ertz and Leblanc-Proulx, 2018), and associated services (Cooper et al., 2019;Giannetti et al., 2016). These elements are highly disintegrated.Until date, the bibliometric analyses on the subject have focused on the engineering aspects of the electric car (Hu et al., 2014;Zhao et al., 2018); however, numerous studies consider other elements such as electric car's energy management (Zhang et al., 2015), charging systems (Globisch et al., 2019;Wu, 2019), sustainable models linked to sharing economy contracts (Ertz and Leblanc-Proulx, 2018), and associated services (Cooper et al., 2019;Giannetti et al., 2016).

        <p>The bibliometric method used in this study can help the readers to identify the main research domain variables in a short time, and thus contribute towards integrating these elements in the literature. Concerning the Scopus database, as mentioned by Okoli and Schabram (2010), it is a multidisciplinary database suitable for information systems (IS) researchers. Finally, as stated by Oakleaf (2010), the Scopus includes the Institute for Scientific Information-and Scopus-indexed and ranked papers. Hence, this study used the Scopus database.The bibliometric method used in this study can help the readers to identify the main research domain variables in a short time, and thus contribute towards integrating these elements in the literature.

        <p>In the first phase, the analysis returned 235 documents. However, as mentioned in Guthrie et al.'s (2012) contribution and followed by Massaro et al. (2016) for journal selection, researchers may simultaneously focus on generalist and specialist journals. The use of multiple journals provides a better understanding of the importance and scientific depth of the subject under investigation.In the first phase, the analysis returned 235 documents.

        <p>The next step involved considering only peer-reviewed scientific articles. As stated by Kelly et al. (2014), a peer review process facilitates reliable scientific communication, stimulates meaningful research questions, and provides accurate conclusions. Hence, we used the Document type filter on Scopus, including only articles. The final sample comprised 104 scientific sources published between 2005 and 2019. The researchers decided not to limit the research duration, given that the research is addressing an undeveloped topic and the analysis also aims to provide a research trend over the years.The next step involved considering only peer-reviewed scientific articles.

        <p>After the study design phase, the second step entailed the use of the open-source statistical application R to conduct the business model and electric cars analysis. The data collection stage involved the creation of the .bib file for the third phase, which is Data Analysis. In this phase, researchers used the software R and the bibliometrix codes to perform a descriptive bibliometric analysis and create a matrix comprising all the documents. Additionally, biblioshiny was used for the creation of a conceptual map and cocitation network.

        <p>The dominance factor (DF) is a ratio measuring the fraction of multi-authored articles in which an author acts as the first author (Kumar and Kumar, 2008). Several bibliometric studies use the DF factor in their analyses (Elango and Rajendran, 2012;Gatto and Drago, 2020). The DF ranking calculates the author's dominance in producing articles. The DF factor is calculated by dividing the proportion of the number of multi-authored papers of an author as the first author (Nmf) by the total number of multi-authored papers of the author (Nmt). In the single author case, this is omitted due to its constant value of 1 for single-authored papers. The mathematical equation for the DF factor is shown as: The following section investigates the main keywords used for specific research areas by showing which keywords are related to the electric car model.The dominance factor (DF) is a ratio measuring the fraction of multi-authored articles in which an author acts as the first author (Kumar and Kumar, 2008).

        <p>Concerning the electric power systems (Fig. 5), they are divided into two main strands. The first strand focuses on recycling connected to environmental impact, product life cycle, and industry connections to hybrid vehicles, and the second strand focuses on technology and the fallout and the composition of various models associated with the production of the electric car. If we consider the second block, which is also the one with the most divisions and developments, we can define different areas of interest and connection. If we consider sustainable technologies connected to the optimization of resources, we can identify a relationship between these technologies and the electric car. A change in these transportation technologies has affected regional strategies connected to the use of these technologies, particularly in China. The optimization of resources and the policies adopted in this regard are connected to the introduction of new technologies, which influence the choice between the use of public transport and private car. These choices, in turn, influence urban transport policies and decisions concerning the adoption of various technologies and implementation of new models. The business models built on the basis of these approaches and strategies are connected to automotive and fuel manufacturing, the number of sales, cost efficiency models, fleet operations, and adoption of secondary batteries. Business models, fuels, and transactions are connected to car transportation plans, available plug-ins for public recharging, carbon emission, and characteristics of the cells used in the electric cars.Concerning the electric power systems (Fig. 5), they are divided into two main strands.

        <p>The type of cars used depends on the roads, the cost reduction available, and the cost of fossil fuel. The type of car is always connected to the CO 2 emissions generated and the consequent need to use electric cars to reduce and control emissions, thereby lowering the impact on climate change and reducing the traffic discharge. This implies the significant use of electric cars for mass transportation and its economic and social effects in urban areas.The type of cars used depends on the roads, the cost reduction available, and the cost of fossil fuel.

        <p>Furthermore, the word cloud in Fig. 6 highlights aspects related to the electric model, such as sustainability, urban mobility, and carsharing. The figure depicts how sustainability models are linked to the use of the electric car in the most populated areas, such as China. These models also drive changes in policies. In terms of urban mobility, the sustainability factor also promotes the moderate use of electric carpooling in the cases of emergencies and as an alternative to the municipal public service. Fig. 7 represents the search trends based on the keywords analysed. The research commenced in 2011. First, it identified research topics related to automotive and product life cycle; in 2013, the research focused on the development of new technologies; in 2014, the research found the number of articles concentrated on the use of electricity in the automotive sector; in 2015, the research analysed the technologies related to electric cars and their environmental impact. In 2016, the first studies aimed at identifying the optimization of technology and analysing the profitability linked to mobility through the use of innovative technologies such as the electric car. In 2017, the studies in China focused on electric vehicles and their costs and commercial viability, with the first studies investigating new transportation systems. In 2018, the country studied the issues pertaining to sustainability and the use of new technologies to counteract CO 2. In this regard, it analysed electric cars based on the themes studied in 2017dnew technologies and transport systems. In 2019, there were articles on the use of electric vehicles for fleet operation; these studies led to new developments on the topic (Oxley et al., 2012). Fleet management optimises costs, risks, and fleet. In other words, fleet managers are responsible for controlling costs, maximizing profitability, and reducing fleet vehicle risks. It involves increasing fleet productivity by using telematic resources and software; these resources help owners gauge maintenance requirements, minimise idle time, downsize fleet, improve tracking and routing, monitor safety, and improve employee efficiency. In fleet management, the GPS tracking solution helps to track the vehicle is closest to the job; this solution minimizes travel time, enables drivers to drop customers at their destinations more quickly, and, eventually, contributes toward customer satisfaction. Fleet management also promotes better management and use of fuel, thereby reducing its cost; in particular, fuel accounts for nearly 40% of fleet ownership (He et al., 2017;Lin et al., 2013). GPS vehicle tracking solutions, as Source: Authors' elaboration using Biblioshiny part of fleet management, can reduce fuel costs by 20%e25% (Paltsev et al., 2018). These tracking solutions indicate the idle time per vehicle and deliver idle time averages across the fleet. They also monitor fleet performance, track how improvements affect idle time, and educate drivers about the need to reduce idle times. GPS tracking solutions also reduce fuel by optimizing routes. Typically, companies that adopt these solutions reduce total miles driven by 5%e10% (Hill et al., 2019). They help drivers to plan more efficient routes by providing them access to maps and details of the location and destination of each fleet vehicle.Furthermore, the word cloud in Fig. 6 highlights aspects related to the electric model, such as sustainability, urban mobility, and carsharing.

        <p>Fig. 8 and Table 8 display the countries where the electric car business model theme has been considered. China tops the list of countries with the maximum number of articles on the topic (43); as already highlighted by several articles, China has been most affected by pollution and new policies adopted for sustainable sustainability. It is followed by the United States of America ( 22), Germany (21), the United Kingdom (13), Italy (9), and the Netherlands (9). It is immediately evident how the theme has developed in countries located in different continents, highlighting a growing interest in globalized policies related to pollution and sustainable mobility. In Asia, China has the highest concern towards pollution control. The United States of America and Canada are equally concerned, while South America is the most representative country. Germany and the United Kingdom have also published the maximum number of articles on the topic in Europe. The diffused blue colour in Fig. 8 demonstrates a remarkable development in the topic in different countries (Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, France, Sweden, Spain, Belgium, Portugal, and Switzerland).Fig. 8 and Table 8 display the countries where the electric car business model theme has been considered.

        <p>This section discusses articles on business models and electric cars in terms of single or multiple publications in each country. In this regard, it also aims to observe collaboration and networking between countries. Table 9 highlights the average citation by state, and shows that the United States of America, Finland, and Denmark have a higher average of citations than the other countries. China, Germany, the United States of America, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Italy have the most significant number of citations. The automotive sector of these countries may have witnessed a substantial development, drawing the attention of researchers to this subject area.This section discusses articles on business models and electric cars in terms of single or multiple publications in each country.

        <p>In general, the literature underlying business models for electric cars appears to be extensive. Hence, it is important to evaluate the value created through these models and identify innovation models (Chester et al., 2019) and possible structural impediments to the diffusion of certain products (Krommes and Schmidt, 2017;Nieuwenhuis, 2018).In general, the literature underlying business models for electric cars appears to be extensive.

        <p>One of the notable aspects of electric vehicles (EV) is their charging system, which comprises individual charging points based on direct agreements between the company and the applicant, common charging points in the workplace, public charging stations, and fast-charging stations.One of the notable aspects of electric vehicles (EV) is their charging system, which comprises individual charging points based on direct agreements between the company and the applicant, common charging points in the workplace, public charging stations, and fast-charging stations.</p>
        <p>Each choice presupposes an underlying business model decision. According to Wu (2019), business models should be based on driving, charging, and battery switching dynamics. It is essential to decide which role the service provider can play. The analysis finds that policymakers rely on fixed charging contracts in order to maintain the EV sharing activity. However, this decision can change with an increase in energy costs. If the vehicle sharing network increases pricing, then most recommended charging technology would be direct charging by the network's energy operator. However, the analysis of Globisch et al. (2019), based on assessments of 1003 German car drivers, concludes that drivers express reluctance to pay necessary charges against the use of public charging infrastructure (Baresch and Moser, 2019). This challenge can be overcome by solar charging stations (Robinson et al., 2014). Although these charging stations can be costly to install in public and industrial spaces, these costs can be covered through sponsorships, percentage subscriptions, or a free usage model for buyers of EVs from specific car manufacturers' 4.8.2. Services High vehicle production costs are driving companies to focus on a wide range of services for drivers (Cooper et al., 2019;Giannetti et al., 2016). The primary evidence is concerned with personalisation and user experience enhancement services, generic mobility services, shared mobility and related cars (Athanasopoulou et al., 2019).Each choice presupposes an underlying business model decision.

        <p>Shared mobility, which is a part of the sharing economy, has led to new business models managed by third-party companies instead of vehicle manufacturers. According to Clewlow (2016), in San Francisco, the number of owned vehicles is lower as the city focuses on sustainable mobility. Besides, privately owned vehicles in the city are hybrid, plug-in hybrid electric, or fully electric vehicles. These choices influence manufacturers' sales model and marketing choices for that area.Shared mobility, which is a part of the sharing economy, has led to new business models managed by third-party companies instead of vehicle manufacturers.

        <p>Concerning the insurance services, the evidence from Wu (2019) shows that, in the case of vehicle sharing, insurance with a fixed premium must be preferred if there are many users.

Under this type of scheme, the consumer preference analysis of Liao et al. (2019) shows that the model can be driven by lease EV vehicles and not just batteries. Those who perceive the added value of the electric car are more inclined to purchase through leasing. Government's financial incentives can also increase sales and consideration.In other schemes, the battery may not be included in the purchase.

        <p>Another challenging point is the transformation of production facilities, in light of new business models for the automotive sector. The transformation of vehicle ownership models also requires a change in the vision of the manufacturers. This thesis is supported by Nieuwenhuis (2018); the author describes how new 3D printing can revolutionise the business models of production plants. This can be achieved by establishing retail micro-factories capable of meeting a diversified demand (Wells, 2013).Another challenging point is the transformation of production facilities, in light of new business models for the automotive sector.

This evidence further demonstrates the broad approach of this research area in defining the business models. Moreover, the topic dendrogram (Fig. 5) describes two evolutions of the discussion. The first group considers innovative aspects of business models, including innovative technologies and resource optimization. The second group represents the less-explored area of electricity management systems, including battery recycling and life cycle.From the keywords used, the business models adopted for electric cars are driven by the factors of innovation, including E-mobility and car-sharing, electric batteries, and energy management.

        <p>Besides, this study also discovers that business models for electric cars were adopted by considering (1) charging technologies, (2) services, (3) electricity management, (4) contracts, and (5) plant. Each of them is divided into elements currently under discussion by researchers (Table 10).Besides, this study also discovers that business models for electric cars were adopted by considering (1) charging technologies, (2) services, (3) electricity management, (4) contracts, and (5) plant.

        <p>The research also shows a lack of relationship between sustainability and policies aimed at increasing the share of renewable energy for recharging electric batteries. One of the issues not included in the scientific discussion of business models is the role that smart cities can play with respect to the elements indicated in Table 10. Particularly, smart cities are looking for sustainability models for vehicle management (Trindade et al., 2017). From this point of view, it would also be interesting to investigate the role of public authorities in promoting the innovation of electric car business models. Moreover, this research area seems to lack an indepth discussion on battery disposal as an intrinsic element of the business model of EV manufacturers.The research also shows a lack of relationship between sustainability and policies aimed at increasing the share of renewable energy for recharging electric batteries.

        <p>From country point of view, China (43 publications), the United States of America (22 publications), and Germany (21 publications) have the highest number of studies on the subject. China, in particular, has been witnessing an increase in road transportation since the past several years, which has increased its use of fossil fuels. These fuel significantly increase the emissions of greenhouse gases and pollutants (Yan et al., 2010). Therefore, at the scientific level, by promoting the use of both pure and hybrid electric vehicles, researchers have tried to propose alternatives to traditional engines in order to increase environmental sustainability (L.-Y. He and Chen, 2013).From country point of view, China (43 publications), the United States of America (22 publications), and Germany (21 publications) have the highest number of studies on the subject.

        <p>This study aims to provide a bibliometric analysis of the publications on the business models for electric cars. Although there is a considerable amount of literature on this subject, we observed that the literature lacked a bibliometric analysis. Using science mapping workflow and multiple research questions, we investigated the trend of scientific publications on the subject, unexplored information, the future directions, and implications.This study aims to provide a bibliometric analysis of the publications on the business models for electric cars.

        <p>Concerning future research, we believe that an analysis of the break-even point between the use of electric cars and traditional cars at a scientific level can further develop this topic and indirectly contribute towards the management of business models, thereby benefitting managers and policymakers.Concerning future research, we believe that an analysis of the break-even point between the use of electric cars and traditional cars at a scientific level can further develop this topic and indirectly contribute towards the management of business models, thereby benefitting managers and policymakers.</p>
        <p>We also believe that future research may focus on impact and sensitivity analyses of electric car contracts. Besides, further case studies could investigate how business model related to electric cars affect population-intensive countries. This can be particularly interesting for all the institutions working in highly populous countries as China.We also believe that future research may focus on impact and sensitivity analyses of electric car contracts.

        <p>Additionally, further analysis could also identify why some parts of the world did not conduct studies on this area. It would be useful to conduct a comparative analysis between countries active in this field of research and countries that are not currently involved. This would make it possible to identify variables affecting the presence or absence of electric cars.Additionally, further analysis could also identify why some parts of the world did not conduct studies on this area.
