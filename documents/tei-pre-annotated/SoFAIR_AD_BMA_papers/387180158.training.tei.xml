        <p>Multicriteria decision-making tools are widely used in complex decision-making problems. There are also numerous points of decision-making in transportation. One of these decision-making points regards clean technology vehicle determination. Clean technology vehicles, such as electric buses, have some advantages compared to other technologies like internal combustion engine vehicles. Notably, electric vehicles emit zero tailpipe emissions, thereby ensuring cleaner air for cities and making these clean technologies preferable to other technologies, especially in highly populated areas for better air quality and more livable cities. In this study, we propose a multicriteria decision-making process using analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) in the context of an electric bus in the center of Ankara. Six potential electric bus alternatives were evaluated under seven specific criteria. Overall, EV-2 electric buses outperformed other electric bus alternatives based on the chosen criteria. In addition, the stability of the results obtained under different scenarios using this method was established via sensitivity analysis.Multicriteria decision-making tools are widely used in complex decision-making problems.

        <p>Rapid urbanization with increasing population density has caused multiple problems in urban areas. One of the most critical problems is transportation regarding new infrastructure. The emergence of internal combustion vehicles causes traffic problems and affects air quality in city centers [1][2][3][4]. Increased car traffic in cities also causes problems such as decreased travel speed for city residents, thereby causing significant time loss both in terms of productivity and leisure. At the same time, traffic congestion threatens accessibility to destination points, especially those that are in the city center. Road safety, increased air pollution, traffic noise, and global warming are also concerns [5]. All of these problems negatively influence the quality of human life and impact the environment.Rapid urbanization with increasing population density has caused multiple problems in urban areas.

        <p>These social and technical situations require planners and decision-makers to promote change from private cars to public transportation. Public transport is an essential element of urban life since it reduces car traffic and provides city residents with mobility. It also reduces emissions such as carbon dioxide, which has become more critical since the Kyoto protocol was introduced. Greater use of public transport instead of private cars reduces these emissions [6]. Furthermore, public transportation activity is one of the most powerful indicators of economic development and human prosperity in urban areas. Buses play a significant role in the provision of public transportation, being cheap, flexible, and, in many cases, superior in terms of capacity and speed. Therefore, the bus remains the most suitable solution from an economic, environmental, and social point of view in regard to balanced and sustainable urban development. The most crucial problem of transportation concerns sustainability. Briefly, sustainable transportation is defined as "the transportation that meets mobility needs while Sustainability 2020, 12, 2777 2 of 19 also preserving and enhancing human and ecosystem health, economic progress, and social justice now and in the future" [7]. In this respect, environmentally-friendly vehicles should be offered together with developing technology. Rapid deployment of electric buses has received increasing attention around the world in the field of transport, which can be largely accredited to stricter environmental requirements in public transport for emission reductions [8]. In addition to the potential reductions in greenhouse gas emissions via electricity generation from renewable sources, electric buses also offer significant additional benefits, such as reduced energy consumption and noise, compared to engines traditionally used in buses [9,10]. Therefore, electric buses could also help to address air and noise pollution issues [11,12].These social and technical situations require planners and decision-makers to promote change from private cars to public transportation.

        <p>Deployment of electric buses has accelerated quickly in the past five to ten years worldwide, with an estimated global battery-electric bus fleet of 345,000 vehicles in 2016. Notably, China possesses nearly 90% of the global electric bus fleet, whereas Europe accounts for 1273 vehicles of the global stock, with only 200 in the USA [13]. Electric bus transportation systems are now consistently part of urban plans made for mass transportation and are used in urban areas. The new technology involves using electricity as an environmentally friendly alternative energy source, thereby making significant improvements in urban areas and increasing city livability. Due to technology developing day-by-day, selecting the most suitable bus technology, including building new buses and developing new characteristics such as environmental friendliness, is of great importance for metropolitan cities.Deployment of electric buses has accelerated quickly in the past five to ten years worldwide, with an estimated global battery-electric bus fleet of 345,000 vehicles in 2016.

        <p>Urban public transport decision-making is a suitable area for multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) because multiple actors are involved in the design and operation of urban passenger transportation, such as the private and public sectors. However, the decision-making process regarding public transportation is a very complicated task involving multiple economic, environmental, and sociopolitical issues [14]. The selection of a bus system depends on various criteria, such as speed, total passenger capacity, range, power, battery capacity, and charging time. To accommodate this and to evaluate all criteria at the same time, this article utilized an MCDM process to consider the problem of electric bus selection for public transportation using analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods for the multicriteria decision-making approach. The hybrid approach included the simplicity of AHP and the efficiency of the TOPSIS method. A decision hierarchy was established, and experts were utilized to assess the pairwise comparison matrices and alternatives.Urban public transport decision-making is a suitable area for multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) because multiple actors are involved in the design and operation of urban passenger transportation, such as the private and public sectors.

        <p>Air quality has an effect on human health, with air pollution being at dangerous levels in many parts of the world and millions of premature deaths occurring globally due to poor air quality every year. One of the most essential factors of this situation is vehicle emission [15], with another factor being global warming. The transportation sector has one of the most significant effects on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as conventional vehicles that only use internal combustion engines consume large amounts of fossil fuels. They also emit gases into the natural environment, such as carbon oxides, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides [16], affecting human lives, health, and global warming in the process. These global interactions are further affected by ecosystems and animal habitats, and also the use of natural supplies [17,18]. Production decline in global oil reserves and stringent environmental policies are needed to create new and clean transportation technologies [19][20][21][22]. Full electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles, which involve only the pass process used in fully electric vehicles, have been improved to overcome these environmental and energy problems over the last ten years. Clearly, these vehicles are better than conventional vehicles in terms of fuel economy, but the aim of developing vehicle technologies is to produce fully electric vehicles [23].Air quality has an effect on human health, with air pollution being at dangerous levels in many parts of the world and millions of premature deaths occurring globally due to poor air quality every year.

        <p>Due to their various benefits, including zero emissions, electric buses are currently being introduced in more and more cities worldwide for public transportation purposes. Special vehicle public transport is generally regarded as relatively sustainable, but, the use of conventional vehicles and buses are not sustainable and damage the environment [24,25]. The use of electric vehicles/buses is a good environmentally friendly and sustainable solution.Due to their various benefits, including zero emissions, electric buses are currently being introduced in more and more cities worldwide for public transportation purposes.

        <p>The widespread interest of city managers and planners in public transportation has attracted a great deal of academic interest. Numerous studies were published that ranked or selected alternatives for transportation by using multicriteria decision-making methods, fuzzy and hybrid applications, and analytical methods in recent years. These studies used such methods as analytic network process (ANP), TOPSIS, VIKOR, ELECTRE, fuzzy numbers, and hybrid approaches for the transportation selection process. A complicated selection process must consider various criteria and sub-criteria, otherwise, the model simply cannot lead to correct decision-making. The reviewed literature is briefly summarized in Table 1 in terms of source, year, objective, and study method. The above literature review clearly indicates that electric vehicles comprise an important research problem from both a theoretical and practical perspective. However, one of the most interesting and challenging problems is electric bus selection due to its specific characteristics under electric vehicle technology.

        <p>The TOPSIS method was presented by Jen Chen and Lai Hwang (1992), with reference to Hwang and Yoon (1981) [97,98]. The basic principle in this model with respect to multiple criteria involves the chosen alternative having the shortest distance from the ideal solution and the farthest distance from the negative ideal solution. The ideal solution minimizes cost-type criteria and maximizes beneficial criteria, while the negative ideal solution is the reverse situation. Stated in other words, the optimal alternative is the farthest from the negative ideal solution, therefore, the optimal alternative is geometrically closest to the ideal solution. While the ideal solution is defined using the best value rating alternatives for each individual criterion, the negative ideal solution represents the worst value rating alternative [99].The TOPSIS method was presented by Jen Chen and Lai Hwang (1992), with reference to Hwang and Yoon (1981) [97,98].

        <p>Here, alternatives were ranked using TOPSIS. The proposed AHP-TOPSIS decision model was applied to select a suitable electric bus. After obtaining the local weights of the criteria via AHP, the decision matrix was constructed. Electric busses used at various cities in the world are helped as decision alternatives in this study. For the purpose of the selection of electric buss, the quantitative data used are shown in Table 4. Table 5 shows the attribute values of each electric bus alternative for the TOPSIS method. We used these values for the TOPSIS method as the initial decision matrix. Firstly, in the table, the electric buses are considered as the alternatives and these are placed in the rows. The criteria or attributes are placed in columns. After normalizing the decision matrix, it was multiplied by the weights of the criteria obtained from the AHP method to derive the weighted normalized decision matrix according to Table 5 and expression (6). Table 6 shows the weighted normalized decision matrix. The positive ideal solution and negative ideal solution were calculated using expression (8) and expression (9). The ideal solution was represented by EV + = {0.034, 0.083, 0.080, 0.055, 0.186, 0.023} and the negative ideal solution was represented by EV -= {0.026, 0.031, 0.013, 0.016, 0.080, 0.129}. Finally, the distance between the ideal and negative ideal solutions was calculated using expressions (10) and (11), and the last expression (12) was used for the final ranking. Based on the CCi values shown in Table 7, the ranking of the electric buses was EV_2, EV_1, EV_6, EV_5, EV_4, and EV_3. The application results indicated that EV_2 was the best, with a CC j value of 0.7434 according to the determination criteria.Here, alternatives were ranked using TOPSIS.

        <p>This section analyzes the criteria weights that were not considered, i.e., whether the criteria would result in ranking change if the priorities were equal. Similar calculations with AHP-weighted TOPSIS were performed for the other alternatives, with the results of the TOPSIS analyses summarized in Table 8. Results of the analysis and the CCj values obtained are presented in the same table, alongside comparisons with previous values. Based on the CCj values, the ranking of the alternatives in order of preference was EV_2, EV_1, EV_6, EV_5, EV_4, and EV_3. The proposed model results indicated that EV_2 was the best alternative, with a CCj value of 0.6257. The best alternative did not change according to the unweighted ranking result. Since the results of TOPSIS depended on the weight coefficient of the evaluation criteria, this section presents an analysis of the sensitivity of the results to change in criteria weights. The rankings occasionally varied with minimal change in the weight coefficient. We used three different weight coefficients, 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75, in the sensitivity analysis, with each criterion weight changing according to these coefficients, respectively. Eighteen sensitivity analysis scenarios using new criteria weights are given in Table 9. Within each phase of the sensitivity analysis, the weight coefficients of the criteria increased by 25%, 50%, and 75%, respectively. In each scenario, only one criterion was favored, for which the weight coefficient increased by the stated values. The changes in the ranking alternatives during the 18 scenarios in the AHP-TOPSIS method are presented in Figure 4. The results showed that, out of the 18 scenarios, assigning different weights to the criteria did not lead to a significant change in the alternative rankings. By analyzing the rankings through 18 scenarios, the EV_1 and EV_2 alternatives kept their rankings throughout all 18 scenarios. The AHP-weighted TOPSIS rankings did not change in any scenario, and the use of AHP did not improve the TOPSIS results. However, distances between the preference rankings in the AHP-TOPSIS hybrid model increased and became more apparent, therefore, AHP affected the TOPSIS results. Thus, the AHP-TOPSIS ranking was confirmed from the 18 scenarios. A small change was observed in four situations, with three of these changes dealing with the shift in the weight of criterion six. Based on this, it was concluded that there was satisfactory rank closeness and that the proposed AHP-TOPSIS ranking was credible.This section analyzes the criteria weights that were not considered, i.e., whether the criteria would result in ranking change if the priorities were equal.

        <p>The AHP method was applied in this study to determine criteria weights, the hybrid method was applied to rank the candidates, and the TOPSIS method was used to compare them in an attempt to match increasing demand for sustainable public transportation services in a developing country. Public transportation is more difficult in countries with large populations, with governments producing policies to reduce exhaust gases. To this point, electric buses are the most suitable vehicles than the alternatives. In this paper, electric bus technology for urban mass transportation was investigated. Electric buses have become more widespread and popular in the public transportation sector, with advantages including reduced emissions, quieter engines, less vibration, and increased comfort for riders. A hybrid AHP-TOPSIS method was implemented to select the best alternative electric bus, where a hierarchy composed of criteria and nine alternatives was firstly determined and the weights of the criteria were determined using AHP. Then, TOPSIS was used to evaluate six alternatives. The EV_2 electric bus in the alternatives was determined to be the best alternative according to the determined six criteria for mass transportation. According to the result of the AHP and sensitive analysis, the most important factors for the selection of electric buses become battery capacity (C5) with a value of 0.3428 and charging time (C6) with a value of 0.2123.The AHP method was applied in this study to determine criteria weights, the hybrid method was applied to rank the candidates, and the TOPSIS method was used to compare them in an attempt to match increasing demand for sustainable public transportation services in a developing country.

In addition, mathematical models could be combined with this model for relevant other applications, and aesthetics, maximum gradeability, maximum torque, charging capacity, and vehicle dimensions could be used as criteria for the evaluation process.</p>
        <p>In this study, the decision-making process was limited to only electric vehicle technologies. However, it is clear that the transportation sector requires major technological improvement. With further development of technologies and policies, it is possible that hydrogen vehicles or electric autonomous vehicles will become the norm in the coming years. As such, future studies could focus on the selection of hydrogen, autonomous, or electric vehicles for public transportation purposes.In this study, the decision-making process was limited to only electric vehicle technologies.
