        <p>The aim of this paper is to identify and gain insights into small and medium-sized enterprises' (SMEs) rationales ('why') for engaging in sustainable social and environmental practices (SEPs) that influence social and environmental policy and sustainability changes. Specifically, we depart from the predominately quantitative-orientated SEPs literature by conducting indepth interviews and analysis of owners and managers of SMEs in the UK within a legitimacy theoretical framework. Our findings from a comprehensive number of interviewees show that SMEs employ a complex mix of both symbolic and substantive SEPs with the aim of enhancing the legitimacy and sustainability of their operations. The results emphasise the strengths of social engagement, reputation and image, environmental embeddedness, industry differentiation and education facilitators. In particular, the paper shows that legitimating strategies can have a dual purpose of being symbolic in nature, but also inferring a substantive legitimacy claim. Evidence of SMEs maintaining their legitimacy position stretches further via either a moral and/or a pragmatic standpoint.The aim of this paper is to identify and gain insights into small and medium-sized enterprises' (SMEs) rationales ('why') for engaging in sustainable social and environmental practices (SEPs) that influence social and environmental policy and sustainability changes.

        <p>This paper explores 'why' small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) voluntarily engage in sustainable social and environmental practices (SEPs) 1 . SMEs have played, and continue to play an increasingly important role in the global economy and contribute significantly to output, employment and incomes. For example, at the start of 2019, SMEs accounted for 99.9% of all private sector businesses in the UK in 2018 (DBEIS, 2019). They also accounted for 60% and 52% of all private sector employment and turnover, respectively (DBEIS, 2019). Indeed, it has been argued that SMEs will play a huge role in facilitating the ability of the global economy to recover from the negative effects of the current global COVID-19 pandemic. Still, SMEs also cause significant harm to the environment and wider society, and thereby raising major ethical, social and environmental dilemmas for stakeholders, such as customers, governments, regulators and activists. For example, and according to a study conducted by the European Commission, SMEs were responsible for 64% of the industrial pollution in Europe (European Commission, 2010). In the UK context, SMEs account for about 60% of commercial waste and they cause about 43% of serious industrial pollution incidents (Blundel et al., 2013).This paper explores 'why' small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) voluntarily engage in sustainable social and environmental practices (SEPs) 1 .

        <p>Despite the substantial contribution of SMEs and their significant impact on the sustainability of the environment and wider society, most of the prior studies have focused mainly on the social and environmental impact of large listed companies (Berens et al., 2004;Haque &amp; Ntim, 2018, 2020;Harjoto &amp; Rossi, 2019;Gamerschlag et al., 2011;Ntim, 2016).Despite the substantial contribution of SMEs and their significant impact on the sustainability of the environment and wider society, most of the prior studies have focused mainly on the social and environmental impact of large listed companies (Berens et al., 2004;Haque &amp; Ntim, 2018, 2020;Harjoto &amp; Rossi, 2019;Gamerschlag et al., 2011;Ntim, 2016).</p>
        <p>By contrast, existing studies examining the impact of SMEs' activities on the environment and broader society are rare (Boakye et al., 2020;Chassé &amp; Courrent, 2018;Graafland, 2018;Zhu et al., 2018). These studies examining environmental and social issues among SMEs are arguably impaired in that they have mainly employed quantitative methodologies. By contrast, there is limited qualitative evidence on why SMEs voluntarily engage with SEPs (Ciasullo &amp; Troisi, 2013;Veronica et al., 2020) within a legitimation context. We contend that this is primarily due to two main reasons: (i) it is difficult to obtain data from SMEs (based primarily 1By contrast, existing studies examining the impact of SMEs' activities on the environment and broader society are rare (Boakye et al., 2020;Chassé &amp; Courrent, 2018;Graafland, 2018;Zhu et al., 2018).

        <p>For the purpose of this paper and as part of the interviewee process, each SME was asked to identify, what they thought their businesses social and environmental practices were. No indication or explanation as to what these may be was given by the interviewer. Hence, their interpretations ranged from holistic/general initiatives, such as the use of environmentally friendly products and appropriate waste disposal, to more business specific drivers, such as the strategic use of the unemployed and the use of fewer chemicals within their production process.For the purpose of this paper and as part of the interviewee process, each SME was asked to identify, what they thought their businesses social and environmental practices were.

        <p>Nevertheless, it is acknowledged that SME research is expansive in areas of sustainability and social responsibility, for example; more noticeable within developing countries (Crane et al., 2008;Haynes et al., 2013). Research is often narrow at times, such as a focus on responsible entrepreneurship and co-operatives (Fayolle and Matlay 2010; Mazzarol et al., 2014). Thus, there is a growing, global interest of small business and socially responsible practices, in areas, such as supply chains and sustainability for example; warranting further investigation (Spence et al., 2019).Nevertheless, it is acknowledged that SME research is expansive in areas of sustainability and social responsibility, for example; more noticeable within developing countries (Crane et al., 2008;Haynes et al., 2013).

        <p>Theoretically, Ashforth and Gibbs (1990), and Suchman (1995) suggest that organisations may engage in SEPs in order to achieve specific objectives, including gaining, maintaining and/or repairing their legitimacy to engage in operations, winning the support of their key stakeholders, and securing access to critical resources, amongst others. In this case, organisations may attempt to seek legitimacy for their operations by adopting symbolic and/or substantive legitimating management tactics. Symbolic legitimating management strategies will seek to demonstrate organisational commitment to SEPs, but implementation of such practices will aim at winning the support of key stakeholders rather than to bring about meaningful change in an organisation's behaviour towards SEPs in real terms. By contrast, substantive legitimating management strategies will seek to implement SEPs that bring about real and fundamental changes in an organisation's behaviour and practice regarding social and environmental issues. In practice though, as SEPs take time and significant financial resources to implement, it is more likely that an organisation's SEPs can be a mixture of symbolic and substantive management strategies (Ashforth &amp; Gibbs, 1990;Suchman, 1995). In this instance, we argue that organisations are more likely to employ symbolic measures in the short-term in comparison to the long-term, whilst firms with better financial resources may be able to employ substantive management strategies even in the short-term compared with their less financially resourced counterparts.Theoretically, Ashforth and Gibbs (1990), and Suchman (1995) suggest that organisations may engage in SEPs in order to achieve specific objectives, including gaining, maintaining and/or repairing their legitimacy to engage in operations, winning the support of their key stakeholders, and securing access to critical resources, amongst others.

        <p>Consequently, this paper offers a fertile opportunity to explore the diverse rich data of what makes SMEs tick when it comes to 'why' they engage with SEPs. This was a challenge in itself, due to the hidden nature of SEPs within SMEs (Jenkins, 2004;Perrini, 2006;Veronica et al., 2020). Given the need to investigate environmental and social issues among SMEs using qualitative research in order to gain close-up and in-depth understanding (Harjoto &amp; Rossi, 2019;Uzhegova et al., 2020), this paper seeks to provide new and rich insights from UK SMEs undertaking some form of social and/or environmental activities. To do this, we conducted indepth semi-structured interviews with a sample of owners and managers of SMEs in the UK of differing sizes and industries over a two-year period, in order to gain an understanding of why these enterprises engage in SEPs.Consequently, this paper offers a fertile opportunity to explore the diverse rich data of what makes SMEs tick when it comes to 'why' they engage with SEPs.

        <p>Our findings indicate that SMEs not only evidence a commitment to symbolic legitimation, but also a wide range of substantive claims that reduces the legitimacy gap by increasing their intention and continued engagement in substantiating their legitimacy. Our findings are consistent with the expectations of legitimacy theory that organisations may adopt symbolic practices and engage in substantive SEPs in order to improve their reputation and image within the market. This paper, therefore, extends, as well as contributes to the extant limited qualitative evidence by providing insights on why SMEs engage in SEPs. Additionally, and unlike previous limited qualitative studies that have largely been descriptive or relied on insights from innovation and grounded theoretical perspectives (Baron &amp; Apitsa, 2019;Boiral et al., 2019;Blundel et al., 2013;Bos-Brouwers, 2010;Williamson et al., 2006), we use the legtimacy theoretical framework as proposed by Ashforth and Gibbs (1990) to explain why SMEs might voluntarily engage with SEPs.Our findings indicate that SMEs not only evidence a commitment to symbolic legitimation, but also a wide range of substantive claims that reduces the legitimacy gap by increasing their intention and continued engagement in substantiating their legitimacy.

        <p>This paper follows the managerial perspective of what constitutes legitimacy; specified by Ashforth and Gibbs (1990) and later dissected by Suchman (1995) (also see Figure 1). In terms of understanding what legitimacy means, it is Suchman's (1995) broader definition that is used, which is considered to be more appropriate for SMEs. It captures the cognitive position (the perceptive minds of SMEs); evaluative (expanding more than self-justification of a right to exist, but what is also understandable (i.e., some form of explanation of their existence); and a degree of social connectedness (that SMEs' values are brought together with what society deems to be acceptable).This paper follows the managerial perspective of what constitutes legitimacy; specified by Ashforth and Gibbs (1990) and later dissected by Suchman (1995) (also see Figure 1).

        <p>"Legitimacy is a generalised perception or assumption that the actions of an entity are desirable, proper, or appropriate within some socially constructed system of norms, values, beliefs, and definitions." Suchman (1995, p. 574). Due to its flexibility, the definition itself can be tweaked to 'fit' the social and or environmental spectrum, for example, "the generalised perception or assumption that firm's environmental performance is desirable, proper, or appropriate", (Bansal &amp; Clelland, 2004, p. 94)."Legitimacy is a generalised perception or assumption that the actions of an entity are desirable, proper, or appropriate within some socially constructed system of norms, values, beliefs, and definitions."

        <p>The strategic managerial approach of legitimacy is argued by Aerts and Cormier (2009, p. 3), to mean that "organisations are able to make strategic choices to alter their legitimacy status and to cultivate the resources through corporate actions, by adapting their activities and changing perceptions." This associates itself with SMEs and is complemented by Massey (2001, p. 153), who suggests the ways organisations strategically manipulate and deploy symbols in order to gain societal support (Suchman 1995, Ashforth &amp; Gibbs, 1990;Dowling &amp; Pfeffer, 1975). In essence, it is to gain legitimacy from society via some form of communication outlet. It also assumes that management have a greater foothold with their legitimacy strategies and as SME owners have a greater say in the future direction of their firms, this strategic 'angle' seems more appropriate.The strategic managerial approach of legitimacy is argued by Aerts and Cormier (2009, p. 3), to mean that "organisations are able to make strategic choices to alter their legitimacy status and to cultivate the resources through corporate actions, by adapting their activities and changing perceptions."

        <p>It was suggested by Gómez-Carrasco et al. (2020) and Magness (2006), for example that legitimacy theory was integrated into the literature to address 'why' certain issues are addressed by management in their communication with their stakeholders. This operational relationship with business and its constituents is very much apparent in Kechiche and Soparnot (2012), whereby they go on to suggest that there lays a relationship between external actors and the business. The image that is built up by the SME owner is important and derives from the human capital that is brought to the business. This suggests that it has a knock-on effect in terms of the SEPs that could be adopted. Kechiche and Soparnot (2012, p. 99), go on to say that "…it can even influence the behaviour of other SMEs in the same sector".It was suggested by Gómez-Carrasco et al.

        <p>Even from a SME perspective, by placing such interests on the stakeholder audience, it is no surprise that "all organisations, wherever situated, and whatever their characteristics, must recognise the interests of stakeholders..." (Perrini, 2006, p. 307;Donaldson &amp; Dunfee, 1999, p. 247). Perrini (2006) continues to state that researchers are focussing on what Phillips (2003) calls 'stakeholder legitimacy'. He suggests a two-level legitimacy framework to be adhered to, first to recognise that certain stakeholders are important to their business and are therefore, legitimate (derivatively), and second, that legitimacy stems from the moral obligation that is owed to other stakeholders. This appears to suggest that businesses must address and prioritise those immediate stakeholders that probably have the most impact towards the business and show some form of moral legitimacy for their actions in either a consequence, procedure, structural or personal position (Elmagrhi et al., 2019;Tran et al., 2020). This theory does not prejudice against the size of the business and is not constrictive onto which stakeholder perceptions are more desirable, hence, legitimacy, albeit more of a challenge to identify in SME SEPs, is considered an appropriate theoretical pod to justify the SEPs of SMEs to a group of immediate stakeholders (Gómez-Carrasco et al., 2020;Lu et al., 2017).Even from a SME perspective, by placing such interests on the stakeholder audience, it is no surprise that "all organisations, wherever situated, and whatever their characteristics, must recognise the interests of stakeholders..."

        <p>To further explain legitimacy's use in terms of justification as to SMEs practice and communication strategies, Ashforth and Gibbs (1990) debate the rationalisation of the mechanics of legitimacy theory through the two management lenses of substantive and symbolic management strategies. As legitimacy has been conveyed as being in the eyes of the beholder, in other words legitimacy is a "social judgment" (Ashforth &amp; Gibbs, 1990, p. 177), of those constituents. These two legitimation tools are used as a yardstick as to whether the company in question has developed a relationship with society at large.To further explain legitimacy's use in terms of justification as to SMEs practice and communication strategies, Ashforth and Gibbs (1990) debate the rationalisation of the mechanics of legitimacy theory through the two management lenses of substantive and symbolic management strategies.

        <p>For SMEs to gain legitimisation, the typology of legitimacy strategies, constructed by Suchman (1995) is used for reference. Due to the nature of SMEs and the split of substantive and symbolic statements, which are drawn from Ashforth and Gibbs (1990), a choice of a pragmatic, moral and/or cognitive association is offered. For this paper, the two former strands are of greater focus. In understanding 'why' SMEs actually engage in SEPs, the paper captures an array of instances and uses the symbolic and substantive led management framework to establish organisational legitimacy.For SMEs to gain legitimisation, the typology of legitimacy strategies, constructed by Suchman (1995) is used for reference.

        <p>The following diagrammatic representation (see Figure 1) shows the culmination of substantive and symbolic criteria/examples, drawn from Ashforth and Gibbs (1990) (as means of legitimation), and that SMEs may associate with as a means of expressing their legitimacy, depicted by Suchman (1995) (the dynamics of legitimacy). Nevertheless, we note that attempting to engage and legitimise SMEs SEPs has had its barriers. These are partly due to a lack of formal ethical codes, standards and certification (Calace, 2014;Valentine et al., 2019), limited resources ( de Bruin &amp; Moore, 2003;Roberts et al., 2006;Lepoutre &amp; Heene, 2006;Lewis &amp; Cassells, 2010;Veronica et al., 2020), a lack of time (Eweje, 2020;Spence &amp; Rutherford, 2001;Tilley, 2000), SMEs not having sufficient SEP knowledge (Hitchens et al., 2005), and SEPs often 'hidden' from their stakeholder audience (Jenkins, 2004;Perrini, 2005Perrini, , 2006;;Veronica et al., 2020).The following diagrammatic representation (see Figure 1) shows the culmination of substantive and symbolic criteria/examples, drawn from Ashforth and Gibbs (1990) (as means of legitimation), and that SMEs may associate with as a means of expressing their legitimacy, depicted by Suchman (1995) (the dynamics of legitimacy).

        <p>SMEs engagement in SEP's is different from larger businesses. Their association is ignited and developed via owner manager's idiosyncrasies, the pressure of maintaining close stakeholder relationships, differing communication strategies, and some persuasive drivers (Masurel, 2007). The nature of doing business for SMEs engaged in SEPs has said to be largely personal (Jenkins, 2004;Grayson, 2006;Fuller &amp; Tian, 2006), and centres on a more interpersonal, (Murillo &amp; Lozano,2006); and informal working relationship (Kechiche &amp; Soparnot, 2012). SMEs, therefore, are more heavily influenced by the beliefs, values and attitudes of those who run the businesses (Davies &amp; Crane, 2010;Hammann et al., 2009;de Bruin &amp; Moore, 2003). This SME's individuality suggests that SMEs are not 'little big companies', as thought by Tilley (2000).SMEs engagement in SEP's is different from larger businesses.

        <p>A close relationship with their immediate stakeholders (Besser, 2012), is important in order to survive, echoed by Russo and Perrini (2010, p. 211), "…small businesses need such relations with the community to survive, whereas in general, large firms do not. Therefore, it is the community that wants SEPs from small businesses, and as a consequence small businesses pursue SEPs". SMEs, therefore exploit their strong stakeholder relationships that are built out of trust, reputation and legitimacy (Russo &amp; Perrini, 2010, p. 217), with the likes of suppliers, customers, competitors, and the local community. Benefits derived from Russo and Perrini (2010), suggest, a guaranteed stable workforce, an improvement with financial bodies and the company's sustainability over time. Now, SMEs "act responsibly because their legitimacy with immediate stakeholders; employees, customers, suppliers and their 'local' community is at stake in a far more direct and personal way than it is with major corporations" (Fuller and Tian 2006, p. 295).A close relationship with their immediate stakeholders (Besser, 2012), is important in order to survive, echoed by Russo and Perrini (2010, p. 211), "…small businesses need such relations with the community to survive, whereas in general, large firms do not.

        <p>Communication is also seen as different from large businesses. Large company webbased SEP communication, for example is rife (Pattern 2002;Pollack 2003;Welcomer et al., 2003;Adams and Frost 2006). However, SMEs' communication maybe different, due to what Nielsen and Thomsen (2009, p. 181) state, that "...we [SME's] have always been bad at telling the public how good we are". Yet, Graafland et al., (2018) when comparing SMEs with Multinational Corporations (MNCs), suggested visibility to the public and media needs to be addressed. There needs to be more instruments that facilitate the communication of the values and norms within the firm and to its customers, and hence, tools that may increase transparency and better engage stakeholders. Golob and Bartlett (2007) suggest that successful indirect communication outlets such as 'word of mouth', rooted in the individual owner-managers personal values and beliefs (Nielsen &amp; Thomsen,2009) and networking and web-site channels (Guében &amp; Skerratt,2007) are a positive step forward. This direct communication is supported by Jenkins (2006) and Zackrisson et al. (2008). In fact, where there is a meaningful relationship between eBusiness and SEPs, "…owner-managers who are proactive with [SEPs] (for altruistic or commercial benefits) are increasingly using websites to communicate their initiatives to stakeholders," (Parker et al., 2010, p. 510).

        <p>SMEs communication may well be different from that of MNCs, but the explicit and implicit communication divide, i.e. historically larger businesses tend to communicate more explicitly and SMEs more implicitly; the balance is changing (Soundararajan et al., 2017).SMEs communication may well be different from that of MNCs, but the explicit and implicit communication divide, i.e. historically larger businesses tend to communicate more explicitly and SMEs more implicitly; the balance is changing (Soundararajan et al., 2017).</p>

        <p>Due to the first-hand account of our interviewees, this paper has gained important, additional rich insights into the diverse social and environmental nature of SMEs. Regardless of potential barriers and the differing communication outlets, some SMEs consider their SEPs (whatever their impact) to be an important aspect of their everyday business. The astute business owners and upper level management may window dress their SEPs for personal satisfaction or they may have a more strategic role in gaining additional business, for example.Due to the first-hand account of our interviewees, this paper has gained important, additional rich insights into the diverse social and environmental nature of SMEs.

        <p>There is very limited empirical research relating to the application of substantive and symbolic legitimating management strategies, especially that of Ashforth and Gibbs' (1990) dichotomy within the SEPs research generally, but almost none existent with respect to SMEs. For example, evidence provided by Day and Woodward (2004) on the reporting of information relating to employees issues in the director's report of 100 UK largest listed companies suggests that many of the sampled companies disclosed an extensive amount of detail to render it substantive, whereas symbolism was considered a simplistic reiteration of the Companies Act. Substantive claims stem from 'how and why' the companies fulfilled their obligations to employees (Ntim &amp; Soobaroyen, 2013a, b;Soobaroyen &amp; Ntim, 2013). In contrast, symbolic communication within directors' reports are ones, where 'information is made available to employees' and consultation was indicated 'when necessary' (Day &amp; Woodward 2004, p. 53).There is very limited empirical research relating to the application of substantive and symbolic legitimating management strategies, especially that of Ashforth and Gibbs' (1990) dichotomy within the SEPs research generally, but almost none existent with respect to SMEs.

        <p>For environmental legitimacy, Rodrigue et al. (2013) asks the question whether 'environmental governance sends a signal of improved environmental performance that reflects a substantive or symbolic approach to managing their legitimacy'. Symbolic practices would show some level of environmental commitment, but would not result in any meaningful changes to their operations and thus, resulting in a symbolic gesture. Their results, mainly quantitative and for large publicly listed firms show that 'environmental governance mechanisms were part of a symbolic approach to manage stakeholder perceptions of environmental management' (Rodrigue et al., 2013, p. 123); the substantive impact on environmental performance was limited. In this case, environmental issues are perceived to be risks that a business needs to protect itself against and thus, businesses simply signal environmental concerns and this does not necessarily translate into significant environmental improvements (Aslam et al., 2020;Jia &amp; Chen, 2019;Shahab et al., 2018Shahab et al., , 2019Shahab et al., , 2020)).For environmental legitimacy, Rodrigue et al.

Their paper also highlights the 'appearance' of performance (VA's) (symbolic action) is well received by stakeholders to gain legitimacy. Berrone et al. (2009) suggested that symbolic actions could be harmful by having an unconvincing statement of 'green' intent, whilst the public somehow withdraws their legitimacy. In contrast, Soobaroyen and Ntim (2013) investigate 'how' and 'why' public corporations in South Africa rely on symbolic and substantive social disclosures. They report that the make-up of symbolic and substantive coverage changes is dependent on the 'changes in stakeholder salience, societal attitudes and businesses' current state of legitimacy'. The results also show that declarative statements, initially espousing socially acceptable goals of a symbolic nature, developed later with more 'elaborate' disclosures, showing a substantive movement of detailed communications of their actions and activities. This is evidence, as society's attitude changed, businesses were expressing their acknowledgement of the HIV/AIDS issues with "declarative disclosures" (Soobaroyen &amp; Ntim, 2013, p. 103). Substantive measures decrease when fewer pressures are exerted from the likes of the Government and employees, for example.Symbolic adoption simply signalled that 'participation' with VAs did not significantly improve their environmental performance any more so than businesses' that did not partake in the VA initiative.

Thus, and to the best of our knowledge, it is the first time these theoretical dichotomies have been combined with SMEs to assist in uncovering rationales as to SEP engagement. This paper emphasises that SMEs not only confirm to a commitment to symbolic legitimation, but also a wide range of substantive and dual claims that reduces the legitimacy gap 3 . This subsequently contributes not only to the environmental position of SMEs, but also the impact of engaging in social activities as being equally or more important by some SMEs.Noticeably, all the application of the above legitimacy and legitimation techniques are solely found within large publicly listed companies and conducted using quantitative research methods.

        <p>We adopted in-depth semi-structured interviews 4 to allow comprehensive responses and illicit as much rich data as possible, that may not have been collected by a more rigid method of interviews (Veronica et al., 2020;Parry, 2012). A selective and purposive sampling approach was used with the owners and upper level management of twenty SMEs; (Appendix C shows the full SME classification). The range of sampled SMEs resulted in a 15% 'micro' business split (1 to 10 employees); a 30% sample of 'small' businesses (ranging from 11 to 50 employees); a 30% split of small/medium sized businesses (51 to 100 employees); and a 25% sample of medium sized businesses (ranging from 101 to 250 employees). This paper does not make any separate distinctions between 'micro' businesses and those small and medium sized businesses. Such a mixed representative sample helps illustrate the rich and diverse nature of social, environmental, sustainable and ethical practices in operation across a wide range of businesses. The geographical focus was limited to the Yorkshire region in the UK, allowing a "high degree of interrelation between the firms and their environment and the communities in which they operate", (Parry, 2012, p. 224). The focus on Yorkshire was also driven by accessibility, as the authors have family, professional and social connections, which facilitated recruitment of interviewees that otherwise would not be possible in other parts of the UK.We adopted in-depth semi-structured interviews 4 to allow comprehensive responses and illicit as much rich data as possible, that may not have been collected by a more rigid method of interviews (Veronica et al., 2020;Parry, 2012).

        <p>The SME search, which amounted to over 100 businesses, used a non-probability selective sampling technique, this was synonymous with all interviewees, who were 'in control' of their SEPs; owner-managers being a primary interviewee target, (Lähdesmäki, 2012;Parry, 2012). Therefore, each business was notified that the interviewee should be the person with the most control, ownership and knowledge of their social, environmental, sustainable and ethical practices of their business. This could be the owner, the procurement manager, sales or commercial manager; as there is not always a specific job title for such a role. It should, therefore, not be an indication as to their suitability for interview. The sample was not a statistical representation, but simply an adoption of the population characteristics (Ritchie et al., 2003). An examination was undertaken of the websites of a randomly selected group of UK SMEs within the West Yorkshire region; adopting a close proximity strategy, successfully adopted by Parry (2012), Janjuha-Jivraj (2003), and Worthington et al. (2006), as it was initially difficult to persuade SMEs for interview.The SME search, which amounted to over 100 businesses, used a non-probability selective sampling technique, this was synonymous with all interviewees, who were 'in control' of their SEPs; owner-managers being a primary interviewee target, (Lähdesmäki, 2012;Parry, 2012).

        <p>The interviews were tape-recorded in English, with an average duration of 50 minutes. Each interview was mapped around eleven questions (refer to Appendix B) that focussed on 'why' (rationales) SMEs engage in SEPs (Appendix A depicts a list of social, environmental, sustainable and ethical examples across the sample). The sample size maintained its reliability and validity due to its richness and complexities of data (Ritchie et al., 2003), supported by Creswell (2011, p. 209), that "to study a few individuals or a few cases" is typical within qualitative research. A saturation point was reached (Crabtree &amp; DiCicco-Bloom, 2006) after the 20 interviews. This can occur after the first twelve interviews, (Guest et al., 2006) with no new themes likely to emerge. Bertaux (1981) argued that fifteen would be the smallest acceptable size for qualitative research; Morse (1994) even suggested that six participants for phenomenological studies would be acceptable, with Creswell (1998) suggesting between five and twenty-five. A homogeneous sample can be even smaller, as suggested by Kuzel (1992), of between six to eight participants; Coppa and Sriramesh (2013), only using five in-depth interviews and two elite interviews.The interviews were tape-recorded in English, with an average duration of 50 minutes.

        <p>The type of legitimacy could be conferred from two perspectives here. First, those of pragmatic dispositional legitimacy, whereby audiences act as though the SME were an individual, depicting a certain style and personality; a business that threads charitable giving through the core of its business. The constituents of IV02 are thus likely to confer legitimacy that has 'our best interests at heart' and 'share values such as trust, honesty and decency' (Suchman, 1995), in line with the strategic charitable associations. Second, there is an overlap with moral consequence legitimacy via an evaluation of outputs and consequences (Suchman, 1995). SMEs will be judged on what they actually accomplish; the focus on charitable giving (breast cancer) capturing the hearts of new clients, who may also believe 'it is the right thing to do'. This SEP strategy can be seen as added value to their overall image in the eyes of both commercial and institutional stakeholders, and thus agreeing with Battaglia and Frey (2014).The type of legitimacy could be conferred from two perspectives here.

IV08 ultimately needs to reach the expectations of important clients, which it depends on their customs (Ashforth &amp; Gibbs, 1998).</p>
        <p>"…pictures speak volumes and some of our customers when they are buying, if they are an IV08 or a 'talented' customer, [IV08 is where we make things under a private label] so they are manufactured to a brand. It could be a school, it could be a big label, we have some big names, The British Museum, Lush, Liberty of London, River Island, Macy's they are all big brands Jimmy Chu is up there and sometimes they will also want to communicate to their customer base about where their products are being made. They want to show their green credentials, they want to show that they are being socially conscious and conscientious too, so if we have imagery which they can utilise then that's good for them too and their marketing campaign, so again that's good for spreading the message.""…pictures speak volumes and some of our customers when they are buying, if they are an IV08 or a 'talented' customer, [IV08 is where we make things under a private label] so they are manufactured to a brand.

        <p>This type of legitimacy is a good example of an 'exchange' (pragmatic exchange legitimacy) between SME and client (their immediate audience) and sub-clients. IV08's clients can examine their behaviour via their brochures (imagery and dialogue) for their own selfinterests (Suchman, 1995). The practical consequence for them is purchasing a sustainable bag from the SME that is considered trendy and has with it the desirable environmental, social and ethical package that society can associate with. Thus, it adheres to Lindblom's (1994) strategy of influencing the external stakeholder's expectations about its business.This type of legitimacy is a good example of an 'exchange' (pragmatic exchange legitimacy) between SME and client (their immediate audience) and sub-clients.

        <p>IV08 has evidenced a visual approach, in part, to help gain legitimacy from their immediate stakeholders via the impression management techniques of self-promotion (Ogden &amp; Clark, 2005;Lu et al., 2017). Using their brochures which depict their work ethic, both at home and abroad, and also with the connections they have with major fashion establishments. This emphasis legitimises both the SMEs SEPs, but can also be used by their major clients (connection here is noted of the potential supply chain importance). This may be thought of prima facie, as a symbolic gesture to form part of the SMEs public image (Neu et al., 1998), which is often peripheral to the organisations primary goals. On the contrary, these 'visual' messages come in the form of mini-booklets and collectively spearhead the SEPs and sustainable direction the company is goingbeing paramount and embedded within the routes of the business, (Day &amp; Woodward 2004).IV08 has evidenced a visual approach, in part, to help gain legitimacy from their immediate stakeholders via the impression management techniques of self-promotion (Ogden &amp; Clark, 2005;Lu et al., 2017).

        <p>Thus, top fashion houses confer legitimacy upon IV08 and signal the quality and reputation of the product whilst they reap the rewards of affordable sustainable goods and an associated bought 'green' image. It will also involve a degree of self-enhancing through visual effects, designed to capture the thorough dedication IV08 has to the SEP cause and their own selfimprovements, such as employing the long term unemployed and developing 'trendy' sustainable totes bags. It is not just the product itself and the market capitalisation that IV08 has developed, but the way they enhance their business has had a knock-on effect with major industry players. IV08 at some point would have had to win acceptance from the likes of 'Lush' and 'Jimmy Chu' to enhance their validity as (sustainable) practitioners (Suchman, 1995;Ogden &amp; Clark, 2005). Additionally, IV08 gains legitimacy from their major clients through exemplification, with IV08's dedication on sustainable fashionable quality. This pragmatic manipulation, with an exchange and influence position, is in line with what Suchman (1995) suggests as a speedy way to address stakeholders via advertising their good image. IV08 may have experienced some external pressure from their clients or simply as their business grew, they acknowledged their stakeholders and increased their brochure disclosures; a similar incident occurring with Soobaroyen and Ntim (2013), in terms of government pressure.Thus, top fashion houses confer legitimacy upon IV08 and signal the quality and reputation of the product whilst they reap the rewards of affordable sustainable goods and an associated bought 'green' image.

        <p>The substantive level of legitimacy can further be examined from the theme, industry differentiator via third party SEP initiatives. Here, there is evidence from IV11 that a mix of exchange and influence pragmatic type legitimacy is addressed when businesses promote their practice. Developing specific green teams and focussing on communicating their new initiatives, whilst assisting clients with their environmental impacts are examples thereof. The latter, evidence of what Kechiche and Soparnot (2012) were debating that what a SME does, can influence the behaviour of other SMEs.The substantive level of legitimacy can further be examined from the theme, industry differentiator via third party SEP initiatives.

        <p>The very fact that IV11 has engaged in forming an additional team within their business to tackle and manage 'green' issues, is a fundamental substantive message of gaining (building their reputation in select markets and advertise products and their image) and maintaining legitimacy (making sure they communicate honestly and stockpile trust) (Alrazi et al., 2015;Suchman, 1995). This follows the substantive level of legitimacy, via a degree of consultancy and strategic business implementation, as directed by Day and Woodward (2004). This proactive action subsequently influences legitimacy and sends out a statement to their immediate constituents, as shown by IV11.The very fact that IV11 has engaged in forming an additional team within their business to tackle and manage 'green' issues, is a fundamental substantive message of gaining (building their reputation in select markets and advertise products and their image) and maintaining legitimacy (making sure they communicate honestly and stockpile trust) (Alrazi et al., 2015;Suchman, 1995).

        <p>A further example of industry differentiation is that of the substantive legitimation of a 4 th dimension sales cog: winning business via an environmental USP. IV09 operates in a competitive market and legitimises their business practices via a form of pragmatic exchange legitimacy (Suchman, 1995).

        <p>"Yes I can see that there would be a risk that the business would drift back to the more traditional model which lacks that USP, that lacks that differentiation because there'd still be responding to customer demands, customers still say price, price, price and the presentation that….Say four thousand competitors all saying price, quality and service, we can all do the same price, we can all do the same quality of product, we can all provide the same level of service.

        <p>Although initial analysis of interviews showed symbolic and substantive legitimacy, some interviews suggested that dual legitimacy may be possible. IV08's Managing Director sought legitimacy via substantive and/or symbolic means, via a mix of pragmatic dispositional legitimacy and/or a more judgmental position of moral procedural or moral structural legitimacy (Suchman, 1995). The issue here, according to Suchman (1995) and highlighted by Soobaroyen and Ntim (2013), is that there is no specific target audience in the case of moral legitimacy for legitimacy to be placed upon. First, IV08 could be seen as gaining legitimacy via their social strategy, i.e., their 'community savour endeavours', recruiting the long term unemployed and providing them with a fair wage and job security (Ashforth &amp; Gibbs, 1990).Although initial analysis of interviews showed symbolic and substantive legitimacy, some interviews suggested that dual legitimacy may be possible.

        <p>Hence, following a procedural moral legitimacy position, one can be seen as adopting socially acceptable techniques (Suchman, 1995) (i.e., a company may communicate details of their social programme on how it is implemented to gain social acceptance in the absence of whether these activities have actually been effective -are they good at their job?) Alternatively, they may simply be part of a larger collective social and environmental package that portray a more structural form of moral legitimacybecause the organisation reflects intrinsic features that are worthy of support (i.e., employer has a dedicated strategy to assist the long term unemployedviewed by society as morally just).

Therefore, there is a clear message for IV06 to survive and maintain legitimacy, as it is still faced with issues (Suchman, 1995) of competition from larger manufacturers. It is imperative therefore, for the SME to make sure that they meet the needs of an ever changing constituent. If the stakeholders continue to buy into the product, then there is no reason why legitimacy will not continue to be inferred upon the SME by stock piling this trust via stakeholder goodwill and support (Suchman, 1995;Pfeffer, 1981).Even though IV06 has gained legitimacy by following a particular regime (i.e., that of producing cider in a traditional method), and which attracts local stakeholders, this pragmatic stance has met the needs and tastes of their audience (Suchman, 1995).

        <p>"Educating staff with regard to what we were doing environmentally, what we were going to be doing, so that is now incorporated within the induction programme, everybody joining the firm gets a half a day with me as the Sustainable Development Director which therefore you are watching things like an inconvenient tree and essentially getting through to them saying to them this is what we are doing to the planet, this is what we as a company are doing about it and this is what is expected of you as an individual within the company," IV09."Educating staff with regard to what we were doing environmentally, what we were going to be doing, so that is now incorporated within the induction programme, everybody joining the firm gets a half a day with me as the Sustainable Development Director which therefore you are watching things like an inconvenient tree and essentially getting through to them saying to them this is what we are doing to the planet, this is what we as a company are doing about it and this is what is expected of you as an individual within the company," IV09.</p>
        <p>Clearly, there is embeddedness of their SEP position, what the company is doing and what is expected of the employee, suggesting that this is a continuous process. However, if these are not maintained or monitored (in terms of the business's expectations), then there is a risk that substantive educational facilitation may well succumb to simple symbolism. The symbolic feed forward of gaining internal employee's legitimacy here as a means of forwarding the moral message and turning SEPs into practice at home, may be difficult to instil or monitor.Clearly, there is embeddedness of their SEP position, what the company is doing and what is expected of the employee, suggesting that this is a continuous process.

        <p>"If I can educate them at the start, if people have got the knowledge, then they can take that home with them and therefore it won't only be influencing how they operate and how they work here within the company it will also influence how they behave at home and indeed in the pub and their own circle of friends, so therefore we as a business can make a bigger difference by taking the time to actually educate people," "I think the pressures within society absolutely with materialism and consumerism and so on, works against maintaining those values and needs to be a change of understating, hence the emphasis on education and actually trying to get people at a young age to actually understand and just stop and think, actually is there a better way," IV09."If I can educate them at the start, if people have got the knowledge, then they can take that home with them and therefore it won't only be influencing how they operate and how they work here within the company it will also influence how they behave at home and indeed in the pub and their own circle of friends, so therefore we as a business can make a bigger difference by taking the time to actually educate people," "I think the pressures within society absolutely with materialism and consumerism and so on, works against maintaining those values and needs to be a change of understating, hence the emphasis on education and actually trying to get people at a young age to actually understand and just stop and think, actually is there a better way," IV09.</p>
        <p>Reaching their relevant publics at such an early stage and in the way depicted above, stresses the personalistic and direct way emphasised by Fuller and Tian (2006). When reflecting on their environmental impact (partly drawn from the uptake and difficulties in gaining ISO14001 status), IV12 split their rationale of being 'educational facilitators' by withholding knowledge from competitors, but driving the environmental impact through to customers as a potential route for winning and sustaining business. The substantive practice (Ashforth &amp; Gibbs, 1990), of educating constituents as a material process is evident from IV12's position in that they educate their customers on their environmental impact reductions and feed that forward. This positive effect helps maintain client loyalty. In essence, if client loyalty is maintained and the company wins business then this would qualify as a substantive level of legitimacy within IV12's SEP strategy.Reaching their relevant publics at such an early stage and in the way depicted above, stresses the personalistic and direct way emphasised by Fuller and Tian (2006).

        <p>"…we could get that knowledge and pass that knowledge and transfer it with customers to help them achieve that but we wanted then to differentiate ourselves with a lot of our competitors and that was the driving force really was for us to be different and for us to have the confidence to go to customers and say we can actually reduce your impact on the environment because we have done it, it is tried and tested, let's pass that on to you," IV12."…we could get that knowledge and pass that knowledge and transfer it with customers to help them achieve that but we wanted then to differentiate ourselves with a lot of our competitors and that was the driving force really was for us to be different and for us to have the confidence to go to customers and say we can actually reduce your impact on the environment because we have done it, it is tried and tested, let's pass that on to you," IV12.</p>
        <p>With this attribute, IV12 attracts a great deal of additional business. They explain how and why (Soobaroyen &amp; Ntim, 2013;Ashforth &amp; Gibbs, 1900) SEPs will benefit businesses.With this attribute, IV12 attracts a great deal of additional business.

        <p>Incorporating first hand evidence of environmental savings on IV12's own business, triggers interested parties to follow suit. As IV12 will educate businesses on this via training, this example proves that the way you use your knowledge, as stipulated in Stevens et al. (2005), with their extent of using ethical codes, could be translated as a substantive legitimacy claim.Incorporating first hand evidence of environmental savings on IV12's own business, triggers interested parties to follow suit.

        <p>"I have in the last year added into the induction pack for new starters an environmental awareness briefing. When new starters come they have a full health and safety, they have the HR, they have a company brief which is an overview from the Managing Director of the business, why it is here and what it does. They have a technical brief because the majority of people haven't worked in textiles before so they don 't know what a 'warp' and a 'wref' are, so we go back to basics and then we have an environmental brief which talks about all the aspects and impacts working and the site and what they can personally do to improve performance going forward."

        <p>This paper is the first of its kind to bring together SMEs' legitimation techniques based on a number of emerging themes, rationalising 'why' SMEs engage in SEPs. Support is given via in-depth semi-structured interviews that show the flexible nature of Ashforth and Gibbs' (1990), Suchman's (1995) substantive and symbolic strategies that SMEs adopt and the level of legitimation was also guided by Day and Woodward's (2004) legitimation definitional clarity. It shows what types of legitimacy is encountered by SMEs, such as a pragmatic and/or moral path; whilst evidencing the dual nature of the substantive-symbolic continuum. A summary of this paper's findings is as follows. The emerging themes for engaging in SEPs go beyond 'social engagement' affiliations. The paper drew upon, specifically that of 'environmental embeddedness', 'reputation and image', 'educational facilitators', 'social engagement', and 'industry differentiation'; which were considered an important cog within the SMEs overall strategy and proved pivotal in pushing the business forward. Notably, SMEs as 'educational facilitators' use their SEP influence to teach how it should be done, and to whomever would benefit, even among their competitors. Alternatively, some SMEs have sought to become 'industry differentiators' with the uptake of SEPs, becoming an employer of choice and/or a business that puts them one step ahead of the competition. Conversely, SMEs can see the advantages of SEP engagement, even as a potential for new business opportunities to emerge.This paper is the first of its kind to bring together SMEs' legitimation techniques based on a number of emerging themes, rationalising 'why' SMEs engage in SEPs.

        <p>Evidence has emerged that indicates that some SMEs' underlying rationales when claiming substantive legitimacy can range from attracting new business, breaking business barriers down when they have been dominated by large business's, enhancing and exploiting their image and reputation for corporate gain, differentiating their business, and educating clients (feed forward). Even when SEPs are considered to be symbolic, they still show that SMEs have a genuine attempt to engage in the process and show commitment to 'doing their bit'. But SEPs can also be considered more than just a symbolic gesture.Evidence has emerged that indicates that some SMEs' underlying rationales when claiming substantive legitimacy can range from attracting new business, breaking business barriers down when they have been dominated by large business's, enhancing and exploiting their image and reputation for corporate gain, differentiating their business, and educating clients (feed forward).

        <p>Legitimation strategies via a substantive or symbolic method do not always happen in such singularity. Dual consideration shows SME examples that could tilt towards both ends of the spectrum. Evidence is taken from 'educational facilitators.' This latter example for instance can express forwarding SEP knowledge to internal staff, on a yearly or ad-hoc basis which could be considered as a symbolic gesture. But can also offer educational insights to fellow practitioners, even competitors as to their SEP programmes as a means of spreading the word and encouraging further SMEs to engage with SEPs.Legitimation strategies via a substantive or symbolic method do not always happen in such singularity.

        <p>Firstly, from an academic point of view the paper makes several new contributions to the extant SME literature. Legitimacy theory adds to the theoretical debate that examines the relationship between SMEs and SEPs, offering new insights that attempt to extend the relationship between SMEs and SEPs. It also demonstrates how the substantive-symbolic legitimation theoretical dichotomy may be applied with SMEs. The application of legitimacy theory within SMEs' SEPs has never been attempted before and thus, this paper contributes to legitimacy theory itself in the following ways: (i) it shows that legitimacy is flexible in its interpretation and application, for example, applying strategic organisational legitimacy theory to a SME/SEP context, as opposed to an organisation's institutional position; (ii) as a means of investigating SEPs and reporting practices of SMEs, it has allowed this to develop via interview dialogue alone; (iii) it also contributes to legitimacy theory in a symbolic context. The theory allows moral and pragmatic legitimacy types to develop, with the dominant legitimacy position of ceremonial conformity and a variety of situations where gaining legitimacy is found; (iv) legitimacy theory is also associated in a substantive SME context, adding to the diversity of disposition and exchange pragmatism, which solely utilises the legitimation position of role performance; and (v) there is also evidence that SMEs employ a combination of substantive and symbolic strategies in their SEPs, which contribute to the environmental position of SMEs, but also the impact of engaging in social activities as being equally or more important to some SMEs. This paper also responds to the call for an increase in empirical research in the SME area.Firstly, from an academic point of view the paper makes several new contributions to the extant SME literature.

Therefore, research could branch further to undertake a larger scale cross country qualitative SME study, even segmenting this further into sector and SME size specifics. This may improve the understanding of the SEP dynamics of a different and targeted spread of SMEs.(iii) adopting legitimacy theory; and (iv) focusing on the UK context.
