        <p>The world has witnessed a significant rise in greenhouse gas emissions since the end of the 20th century as several economies begin to emerge into industrial hubs and manufacturing giants across the globe. Thus, in the wake of global interest in clean energy development and campaign for sustainable climate and ecosystem, the role of the emerging countries in the debate is unarguably vital and demanding. Importantly, this study seeks to examine the commitment of the leading emerging countries (E7) of Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, and Turkey to energy transition and carbon-neutral 2050. We employ the cross-sectionally augmented autoregressive distributed lag approach that accounts for potential country-specific factors to examine the role of environmental-related technological innovations (ERT) in achieving climate neutrality in the E7 over the period from 1992 to 2018. Notably, the findings revealed that a 1 percent increase in ERT yields $0.33% (short-run) and $ 0.17% (long-run) reductions in carbon emission, thus suggesting that the E7 economies could be heading toward environmental sustainability with the application of ERT. Additionally, the result revealed that the application of ERT in the energy utilization profile significantly reduced the undesirable impact of primary energy utilization.The world has witnessed a significant rise in greenhouse gas emissions since the end of the 20th century as several economies begin to emerge into industrial hubs and manufacturing giants across the globe.

        <p>However, the result showed that such an impact is not enough to trigger a transition to environmentally desirable cleaner energy that could mitigate carbon emissions. This is because the larger share of the E7 countries' primary energy utilization is from conventional and/or non-renewable energy sources. The environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis is also validated.However, the result showed that such an impact is not enough to trigger a transition to environmentally desirable cleaner energy that could mitigate carbon emissions.

        <p>However, the world has seen a dramatic change in emissions trajectory and the composition of major emitting economies toward the end of the 20th century until date. This change occurs as many other economies begin to emerge into industrial hubs and manufacturing giants across the globe. Some of the countries in this category have been classified into various groups. As a prominent group of countries, the world's Emerging seven (E7) economies consisting of China, India, Brazil, Mexico, Russia, Indonesia, and Turkey are increasing gaining more attention in the subject of global climate change (Alola &amp; Nwulu, 2021;Etokakpan et al., 2021;Huang et al., 2021;Zoaka et al., 2022).However, the world has seen a dramatic change in emissions trajectory and the composition of major emitting economies toward the end of the 20th century until date.

        <p>Based on available reliable data, emissions levels have greatly increased among the E7 economies over the last few decades and this bloc of countries is arguably the largest contributor to the global emissions in recent times. Countries like China have emerged as the topemitting nation accounting for over 27% of total emissions as of 2017 according to the United Nation Emission Gap Report (UNEP, 2018). Jiang et al. (2022), noted that greenhouse gasses (GHGs) have been a major challenge to global environmental sustainability, and energyrelated carbon emissions, in particular, stand out as a major concern in countries like China. Other countries among the E7 also contribute to a significant chunk of the global carbon emissions for instance about 7.1% of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were attributed to India. In the South and Central America region, Brazil accounts for the highest emissions with about 35.02% of the region's total carbon dioxide emissions (British Petroleum, 2020). Emission is also fast growing in Turkey, Indonesia, Russia, and Mexico as seen in Figure 1.Based on available reliable data, emissions levels have greatly increased among the E7 economies over the last few decades and this bloc of countries is arguably the largest contributor to the global emissions in recent times.

        <p>As of 2018, China leads in emission among these countries followed by India, Russia, Indonesia, Mexico, Brazil, and Turkey, respectively, and carbon emission level is yet to peak in most of these economies.As of 2018, China leads in emission among these countries followed by India, Russia, Indonesia, Mexico, Brazil, and Turkey, respectively, and carbon emission level is yet to peak in most of these economies.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the literature is currently replete with the dangers of unabated emissions of anthropogenic CO 2 and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions (IPCC, 2007, 1 ; Jolly et al., 2015;Anderson &amp; Bows, 2011;Alola, Adebayo, et al., 2021;Alola, Akadiri, et al., 2021). Besides, growing emissions levels have been identified as a major factor contributing to rising levels of environmental disasters with predictions of more dangers ahead if nothing is done to curtail cumulative emissions in the meantime (IPCC, 2021;UNEP, 2021). Furthermore, Mora et al. (2018) noted that an approximate 584.4 GtC (gigatons of CO 2 ) was emitted from human activities including the burning of fossil fuel, industrial activities, and land use between 1860 and 2014. This was also estimated to have resulted in about 0.9 C of global warming as the global average temperature has maintained an upward trend over the decades as seen in Figure 2.On the other hand, the literature is currently replete with the dangers of unabated emissions of anthropogenic CO 2 and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions (IPCC, 2007, 1 ; Jolly et al., 2015;Anderson &amp; Bows, 2011;Alola, Adebayo, et al., 2021;Alola, Akadiri, et al., 2021).

        <p>Therefore, in the wake of the rising potential dangers of climate change and environmental disaster vis-à-vis increasing GHG emission levels, the impact of innovative technology on carbon emission levels and its significance for achieving the global zero-carbon target is gradually attracting the attention of researchers. At the moment, the bulk of the research relating to the environmental impacts of innovation has addressed countries in the OECD bloc and a couple of Asian economies ( Álvarez-Herránz et al., 2017;Amin et al., 2020;Godil et al., 2021;Shahbaz, Raghutla, et al., 2020). However, there is the concern that countries in some of these blocs may not necessarily be at the same tier of economic progress or development. To the best of the authors' knowledge, none of the existing studies has addressed the innovation-emission nexus for the specific case of the E7 economies except for the most recent study by Tao et al. (2021). However, just like most studies on other blocs mainly considered the innovation-emission nexus, their study also did not examine whether the expected desirables environmental impact of innovation holds in the E7 when interacting the level of innovations with the weights of the overall energy use per capita among these countries. This aspect is however very crucial when considering the quest for wealth creation as seen in the push to maintain economic growth which is a major trait among all economies and most especially for emerging c. Thirdly, within an income-sustainability framework, the study further aims to examine the EKC conjecture for the E7 countries when technological innovation is being accounted for.Therefore, in the wake of the rising potential dangers of climate change and environmental disaster vis-à-vis increasing GHG emission levels, the impact of innovative technology on carbon emission levels and its significance for achieving the global zero-carbon target is gradually attracting the attention of researchers.

        <p>The theoretical underpinnings behind this study are the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) conjecture (Kuznets, 1955) and the Jevons technological innovation paradox (Jevons, 2001). On the aspect of economic growth-environment nexus, the EKC conjecture argues that although the environment may be in jeopardy of pollution at an initial rate of economic growth, the detrimental environmental effects of growth will later clear out at a growth peak after which higher growth would only produce a cleaner environment (Balsalobre-Lorente et al., 2022;Onifade, 2022). To compensate for the initial pollution levels at a higher stage of income according to the EKC conjecture, important factors such as technological innovation among others, have to be integrated into the environment-income nexus.The theoretical underpinnings behind this study are the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) conjecture (Kuznets, 1955) and the Jevons technological innovation paradox (Jevons, 2001).

        <p>It is a conventional belief that technological innovations can enhance environmental sustainability, especially from the perspective of improvement in energy efficiency. However, William Stanley Jevons in 1865 (Jevons, 2001) in his seminar work demonstrated that energy efficiency (through innovations) may not really enhance sustainability as often expected through a reduction in aggregate energy consumption or resource use, on the contrary, it would rather increase consumptions. This view has been popularly regarded as the Jevons paradox and the paradox has been a long-held environmental point of discussion among economists. Inter alia, Bunker (1996) argued that large-scale economic production activities for profit-seeking in a typical economy where the focus is on growth can lead to an increase in overall energy use, even in the presence of potential higher energy efficiency that is achievable through energy technological innovations. Hence, the question of what roles technological innovations play in environmental sustainability may not necessarily follow a straightforward answer especially when the issues bordering on energy use and the quest for economic growth are accounted for.It is a conventional belief that technological innovations can enhance environmental sustainability, especially from the perspective of improvement in energy efficiency.

        <p>They studied a panel of selected countries and their finding showed that there is a higher tendency to have higher energy consumption and CO 2 emission from nations with a higher level of energy efficiency. In other words, carbon emission has the tendency to rise in countries with more innovative capacity to improve energy efficiency. This is because the environmental deficits of increased energy consumption rates such as carbon emission due to energy innovation can outweigh the benefits of the increased energy usage itself. Therefore, technological innovations may not really enhance solutions to environmental challenges, especially given the insatiable quest for economic growth that is often propelled by higher energy demand on the ambient of fossil energy consumption. Hence, the validity of the EKC phenomenon also needs to be well scrutinized by accounting for the impact of innovation.They studied a panel of selected countries and their finding showed that there is a higher tendency to have higher energy consumption and CO 2 emission from nations with a higher level of energy efficiency.

        <p>The analytical approach in this study opens with a critical examination of the datasets for an understanding of their properties. Such critical examinations position researchers for making a well-informed decision Given the valid insights on the presence of CD, the stationarity test to be adopted for variables and corresponding cointegration examinations must be capable of addressing the CD challenge. As such, the IPS and CIPS techniques were applied in exploring the stationarity properties of the variables. These unit root methodologies are useful for observing variation within panels and the techniques also provide essential features for observing the second-order generation in a typical panel analysis. The equational expression of the CIPS procedures is given in Equation (2), while the corresponding test statistics estimator is presented in Equation (3).The analytical approach in this study opens with a critical examination of the datasets for an understanding of their properties.

        <p>In Equation (3), the CDF reflects the cross-sectional dependent augmented Dickey-Fuller (CADF), while the cross-sectional (CD) averages are captured by CA i ̅tÀ1 and ΔCA i,t1 . Moving on, considering the CD properties of the dataset and having utilized a unit root technique that caters to this panel characteristic, the corresponding cointegrating technique to be adopted needs to also take into cognizance the CD challenge in the sample observation. Therefore, the usual first-generation panel, long-run relationship tests could produce misleading evidence for rejecting a null hypothesis under the cointegration analysis. Hence, the Westerlund (2007) secondgeneration cointegration technique was applied to bypass the CD limitation and subsequently ensure accuracy with regard to the validity of the decision on the null hypothesis of no cointegration between panel observations. This cointegration method is modeled after an error adjustment process as depicted in Equation ( 4) to ascertain long-run relationships between variables vis-à-vis the estimated group statistics (Gt, Gα,) as well as panel statistics (Pt, Pα).In Equation (3), the CDF reflects the cross-sectional dependent augmented Dickey-Fuller (CADF), while the cross-sectional (CD) averages are captured by CA i ̅tÀ1 and ΔCA i,t1 .

        <p>In Equation ( 4), (ψ i ) captures the error adjustment process while the β t captures the vector of parameters. On the other hand, there is a possibility of varying the deterministic representations (D t ) of the analysis. For instance, a model can be specified with no deterministic term such that D t = 0, or there could be specification with just the constant term alone such that D t = 1, and both the constant and trend can be captured in the model such that D t = (1, t). The Westerlund (2007) cointegration method stands to be a well-patronized approach in the related literature (Baloch et al., 2021;Bekun et al., 2021) due to its suitability in dealing with matters such as the CD limitations in panel analysis.In Equation ( 4), (ψ i ) captures the error adjustment process while the β t captures the vector of parameters.

        <p>A summary of the descriptive statistics for individual country variables and a sample correlation matrix for the panel observations heralded the presentation of data and empirical discussion as seen in Tables 3 and4 respectively. The highest level of average carbon emissions throughout the study is recorded in China followed by Russia, India, Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, and Turkey, respectively. China also takes the lead in the amount of energy consumption on average over the sample period. As for the correlation among the variables, economic growth and energy use are positively correlated with carbon emission while no significant correlation can be seen between emission and energy innovations. The correlation output partly reveals just a handful of information which is certainly not sufficient as it does not show the true magnitude of impacts of these variables on the emission level. Hence, some other vital preliminary analyses were conducted to take into cognizance the nature of the data set.A summary of the descriptive statistics for individual country variables and a sample correlation matrix for the panel observations heralded the presentation of data and empirical discussion as seen in Tables 3 and4 respectively.

        <p>Further results from the preliminary evaluations confirmed that the dataset for the study suffers from cross-sectional dependence (CD) as seen in Table 5. All the test statistics lend credence to the presence of CD and as such, the unit-root test conducted also took cognizance of this crucial issue. In Table 6, the findings from the CDcompactible unit root tests (CIPS and IPS) reveal that all data are differenced stationary [I(1)] datasets except for the technology innovation data set and the interaction term that are stationary at the level which implies that they are I(0) proxies. This result necessitates that long-run estimators that are compatible for mixed order of integration among variables must be applied if there is evidence of cointegration among the variables. As such, following the confirmation of the long-run relationship among variables by both panel and group statistics of the Westerlund (2007) approach in Table 6, the study adopted the CS-ARDL panel estimator to examine the long-run coefficients as reported in Table 7.Further results from the preliminary evaluations confirmed that the dataset for the study suffers from cross-sectional dependence (CD) as seen in Table 5.

        <p>The output of the empirical results from the CS-ARDL model provides critical information that is apt for policy directives for the E7 economies unlike the results from the PMG techniques that are unreliable due to the challenges of CD that have been established in the preliminary analysis. Hence, following the CS-ARDL estimates in Table 7, the results reveal that both energy consumption and economic growth (real income levels) occur as significant drivers of environmental pollution in the E7 countries. According to the estimates, a percent rise in energy consumption level and economic growth levels induce pollution from CO 2 emissions by 0.51% and 0.68%, respectively. The observed impacts of these two variables reflect the destructive consequences of the environmentally detrimental economic growth push among the E7 countries. The upward trend in the level of economic growth is anchored on increased energy demands that are essentially sustained by fossil fuel usage which is known to constitute the largest chunk of the total primary energy consumption in the emerging seven (E7) economies.

        <p>Intercept and trend Intercept &amp; trend destructive impacts of economic growth and energy consumption, in the long run, are also consistent with the short-run estimates from the model. Also, there is a two-way causality between energy consumption, economic growth, and carbon emissions among these countries as seen in Table 8. The overall results resonate with some empirical information on the nexus among these variables as obtainable in some extant empirical studies, howbeit, some of the studies were in different climes and used other techniques (Alola, 2019;Sarkodie &amp; Owusu, 2017;Shahbaz et al., 2016). The current findings further buttress the empirically substantiated arguments in support of the need for the E7 nations to address their energy portfolios such that the proportion of conventional energy use in total primary energy consumption is reduced to the barest minimal. In this regard, going by several empirical results on the roles of renewables in improving environmental quality as seen in the extant literature (Erdo gan et al., 2021;Onifade, Alola, et al., 2021;Usman &amp; Balsalobre-Lorente, 2022), more investments in renewable energy would help to further position the E7 economies on the expected environmental sustainability path.Intercept and trend Intercept &amp; trend destructive impacts of economic growth and energy consumption, in the long run, are also consistent with the short-run estimates from the model.

        <p>On the other hand, technological innovations produced some succoring shreds of evidence for environmental sustainability among the E7 countries. The estimated CS-ARDL model shows that a percent growth in technological innovation reduces emissions levels by 0.17% in the long run. This nexus is also validated in the short-run dynamics although with a much higher magnitude compared to what is obtainable in the long-run dynamics. This is an indicator for policymakers and authorities in the E7 to leverage on the instrumentality of technological innovation for environmental gains. The results complement a couple of studies in the literature on the beneficial roles of innovation in combating environmental menace (Amin et al., 2020;Shahbaz, Raghutla, et al., 2020;Tao et al., 2021).On the other hand, technological innovations produced some succoring shreds of evidence for environmental sustainability among the E7 countries.

        <p>However, on the aspect of the impacts of the interaction between innovation and energy consumption, the empirical analysis produced contrary evidence for upholding the innovationenvironmental sustainability nexus as a percent rise in the interaction of these variables significantly induces pollution from CO 2 emission by around 0.096%. Although this magnitude is relatively low compared to the impacts of other variables, it, however, portends crucial information about the E7 economies. A possible explanation for this result among the emerging seven (E7) countries is that the environmental gains from innovations tend to be significantly undermined or at least overwhelmed by the magnitude of the impacts of the unsustainable energy portfolios that features environmentally detrimental energy sources as the largest share of the overall total primary energy consumption. Another important point is that the innovation being witnessed among the E7 countries vis-à-vis the energy required to actualize their desired economic growth target has perhaps mainly accelerated higher rates of overall energy use rather than creating a reduction in energy intensity via higher efficiency as expected. Thus, the scenario at play partly aligns with the arguments of Jevons (Jevons, 2001) that innovations may not enhance overall environmental sustainability as expected by a reduction in energy consumption on a broad scale, even though it can reduce carbon emissions levels. Besides, looking at the granger causality in Table 8, it can be further observed that the only directional causality from innovations relates to energy consumption and the latter variable has witnessed exponential growth in the E7 countries over the last couple of decades (British Petroleum, 2020).However, on the aspect of the impacts of the interaction between innovation and energy consumption, the empirical analysis produced contrary evidence for upholding the innovationenvironmental sustainability nexus as a percent rise in the interaction of these variables significantly induces pollution from CO 2 emission by around 0.096%.

        <p>Lastly, while a detrimental impact of economic growth was confirmed in the study in terms of environmental sustainability, there is also evidence that this detrimental effect is expected to be neutralized by income expansion as seen by the significant negative impact of the income square coefficient in the CS-ARDL model. This result thus approves the EKC conjecture for the E7 countries within the incomesustainability framework when technological innovation is accounted for thereby lending credence to some evidence in support of the EKC validity in emerging economies (Baloch et al., 2021). In the results in Table 7, there is no evidence that the system will adjust to equilibrium under the PMG approach as the overall coefficient estimate for the ECT was found to be statistically insignificant despite the possibility of equilibrium adjustment in the country-specific short-run subcategory. This finding further reveals the shortcomings of the PMG technique in the presence of cross-sectional dependency. On the other hand, the CS-ARDL estimates reveal that there will be a significant adjustment to equilibrium for the system following the significant negative value of the ECT (À0.9753). In a nutshell, the use of the lagged cross-sectional averages in the CS-ARDL technique proved to be a better option to the PMG approach as it has taken care of any cross-correlation in residuals owing to identified common factors among observations.Lastly, while a detrimental impact of economic growth was confirmed in the study in terms of environmental sustainability, there is also evidence that this detrimental effect is expected to be neutralized by income expansion as seen by the significant negative impact of the income square coefficient in the CS-ARDL model.

        <p>The impacts of technological innovation and energy use on the environmental quality of the E7 economies have been explored in this study. While doing so, the interaction between the variables was also incorporated into the model to assess its influence among the E7 economies using data covering 1992-2018. The result confirmed the EKC conjecture and suggested that innovation cushions pollutant emissions in the E7 economies. Both energy consumption and economic growth were found to be an adversary to the sustainability of the environment in these emerging economies. Furthermore, while innovation cushions pollutant emissions among the countries, its desirable environmental impacts become unnoticeable when interacting with the level of energy consumption among these economies.The impacts of technological innovation and energy use on the environmental quality of the E7 economies have been explored in this study.

        <p>A major explanation for this development lies in the overwhelming share of conventional energy use in the overall energy portfolios of the E7 economies. As such, the gains from innovations can be said to be undermined in the E7. The causality results also provided some corroborative evidence for the estimates and these inform useful policy directives for the E7 economies and other emerging economies at large.A major explanation for this development lies in the overwhelming share of conventional energy use in the overall energy portfolios of the E7 economies.
