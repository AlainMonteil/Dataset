        <p>Increasingly, researchers have come to acknowledge that consumption activities entail both utilitarian and hedonic components. Whereas utilitarian consumption accentuates the achievement of predetermined outcomes typical of cognitive consumer behavior, its hedonic counterpart relates to affective consumer behavior in dealing with the emotive and multi-sensory aspects of the shopping experience. Therefore, while utilitarian consumption activities appeal to the rationality of customers in inducing their intellectual buy-in of the shopping experience, corresponding customers' emotional buy-in can only be attained through the presence of hedonic consumption activities. The same can be said for online shopping. Because the online shopping environment is characterized by the existence of an IT-enabled web interface that acts as the focal point of contact between customers and vendors, its design should embed utilitarian and hedonic elements in order to create a holistic shopping experience. Building on Expectation Disconfirmation Theory (EDT), this study advances a research model that not only delineates between customers' utilitarian and hedonic expectations for online shopping but also highlights how these expectations can be best served through functional and aesthetic performance respectively. Furthermore, we introduce online shopping experience (i.e., transactional frequency) as a moderator affecting how customers form utilitarian and hedonic expectations along with how they evaluate the functional and aesthetic performances of e-commerce sites. The model is then empirically validated via an online survey questionnaire administered on a sample of 303 respondents. Theoretical contributions and pragmatic implications to be gleaned from our proposed model and its subsequent empirical validation are discussed.Increasingly, researchers have come to acknowledge that consumption activities entail both utilitarian and hedonic components.

        <p>Utilitarian consumption appeals to customers' rationality by accentuating the attainment of desired outcomes from shopping activities [3] whereas hedonic consumption is tied to the entertainment value and relates more to the emotive and multi-sensory aspects of the shopping experience [4]. The same sentiments have been echoed by more recent ecommerce research [5,6]. Although substantive research has been conducted on the utilitarian facets of online shopping, the recognition of the hedonic value of Information Technology (IT) has gained in momentum among both academics [1,2,[15][16][17][18][19][20][21][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14] and practitioners [22].Utilitarian consumption appeals to customers' rationality by accentuating the attainment of desired outcomes from shopping activities [3] whereas hedonic consumption is tied to the entertainment value and relates more to the emotive and multi-sensory aspects of the shopping experience [4].

        <p>Past studies have illustrated that customers treat IT artifacts embedded within ecommerce sites as social actors and ascribe humanlike characteristics to them during interactions [23]. Insofar as e-commerce sites are deemed as social entities by customers, online shopping must not only fulfill its intended utilitarian function [24], it should also deliver a hedonically charged transactional experience [1, 2, 26-31, 8-10, 12, 14, 15, 21, 25]. Though prior research has argued for a dual role of online shopping in fulfilling both utilitarian and hedonic functions, scholars have largely emphasized "a behavioral or cognitive focus, with less attention to hedonic elements of the consumption experience that focus on affective consumer behavior as elicited from emotive and multisensory elements." [14, p. 540]. Even for the handful of studies that have sought to comprehend how hedonic experience manifests in online shopping, they tend to concentrate on prescribing hedonic functionalities for e-commerce sites [7,10] without considering whether these functionalities are desired by customers. This runs contrary to overwhelming empirical evidence that alludes to the criticality of taking into account customers' expectations in relation to their satisfaction [37][38]40].Past studies have illustrated that customers treat IT artifacts embedded within ecommerce sites as social actors and ascribe humanlike characteristics to them during interactions [23].

        <p>Given the pivotal role of the expectation-performance gap in driving customer satisfaction [37][38]40], it is imperative to not only acknowledge that customers' evaluation of the performance of e-commerce sites must conform to or exceed their expectations to assure a satisfactory online shopping experience, but to also concede that customers' expectations and performance evaluations are governed by a duality of cognitive and affective elements.Given the pivotal role of the expectation-performance gap in driving customer satisfaction [37][38]40], it is imperative to not only acknowledge that customers' evaluation of the performance of e-commerce sites must conform to or exceed their expectations to assure a satisfactory online shopping experience, but to also concede that customers' expectations and performance evaluations are governed by a duality of cognitive and affective elements.</p>

As asserted by Hernandez et al. [33], customers' online shopping experience "exerts a moderating effect on certain perceptions that have traditionally defined attitude and intention to buy" [p. 1240,32]. Yet, despite giving due recognition to the moderating influence of online shopping experience on customers' interaction with e-commerce sites, past studies have largely focused on how such experience translates into perceptual changes from pre-to post-adoption stages or dictates subsequent repurchasing behavior [32][33][34]. In other words, the bulk of research has oversimplified the distinction between experienced and inexperienced customers by treating experience as a dichotomy [35,36].Apart from the expectation-performance gap, customers' familiarity with e-commerce sites has been found to moderate their evaluation of and receptivity toward these sites.

        <p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we build on past studies to construct a theoretical model of utilitarian and hedonic consumption behaviors in online shopping together with testable hypotheses. Specifically, our model draws on the EDT in distinguishing between utilitarian and hedonic elements of online shopping as focal antecedents of customer satisfaction towards e-commerce sites. We then arrive at separate typologies of utilitarian and hedonic expectations that drive customers' evaluation of e-commerce sites and prescribe design features, which could be offered by emerchants to fulfill these expectations. We also put forth online shopping experience, in the form of transactional frequency, as a moderator affecting customers' evaluations of ecommerce sites. Subsequently, in the methodology section, we outline an empirical study to validate the hypothesized relationships in our theoretical model and summarize key analytical findings. We conclude the paper with a discussion section that highlights the insights to be gleaned from this investigation in informing the design of e-commerce sites.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

        <p>The Expectation Disconfirmation Theory (EDT) was proposed by Oliver [38,41] as an explanatory framework to comprehend the process of expectation disconfirmation.

        <p>(3) positively disconfirmed whenever the product/service outperforms expectations [38,40]. Although the EDT originates from investigations of physical products, its growing application to a wide range of technology-related phenomena suggest that the theory is versatile in explaining and predicting users' reactions towards technological artifacts in general [e.g., [41][42][43][44][45]. Indeed, the EDT has been applied to elucidate user satisfaction as the disconfirmation of pre-adoption expectations based on post-adoption performance of technological systems ( [47][48][49]. But at the same time, a handful of scholars have contended that users' expectations might vary with the frequency of system usage though not necessarily in a homogeneous fashion [46,[49][50][51]. Consequently, in contrast to preadoption expectations which are typically form from publicly disseminated information or others' opinions, Bhattacherjee [53] alleged that users' post-adoption expectation is more credible because it is founded on actual system usage. This line of thought resonates with the Self-Perception Theory (SPT) [54]. SPT holds that individuals continually adjust their perceptions (e.g., expectations) as they acquire fresh information about a focal behavior based on their own actions or through observing others, which in turn provide the basis for their subsequent behaviors. Consistent with SPT, we anticipate that customers' postadoption expectations, upon interacting with e-commerce sites, will supplant their preconsumption counterparts in cognitive memory and direct subsequent transactional behaviors.(3) positively disconfirmed whenever the product/service outperforms expectations [38,40].

        <p>Additionally, prior research have shown that as users accumulate experience from system usage, their beliefs, attitudes, and usage patterns may change, thereby hinting at the moderating influence of user experience [55]. In the context of e-commerce transactions, discrepancies in beliefs and behavioral actions have been documented among customers with varying online shopping experience. For example, Shi and Chow [56] discovered that it is unlikely for customers with rich online shopping experience to trust a company based on social commerce in comparison to those who with less experience.

        <p>Extending the EDT, we construct a theoretical model that not only delineates between utilitarian and hedonic elements of online shopping as predictors of customer satisfaction towards e-commerce sites, but also positions transaction frequency as a moderating influence affecting customers' formation of expectations and evaluation of performance (see Figure 1). Childers et al. [5] echoed an identical message by distinguishing between utilitarian and hedonic factors as distinct but equally salient influences on customers' attitudes towards online shopping [see also 9,20]. This paper therefore posits that customers' satisfaction with online shopping experiences is reliant on the attainment of both utilitarian and hedonic outcomes. Adapting Oliver's [41] definition, we henceforth refer to utilitarian satisfaction as the psychological state arising from disconfirmed utilitarian expectations and hedonic satisfaction as the psychological state arising from disconfirmed hedonic expectations.

        <p>Utilitarian value has been the center of attention for much of the research conducted in the area of consumer behavior [59]. Utilitarian consumption behavior has been described as rational and task-oriented [65][66][67] such that customers' functional utility is dependent on whether the consumption need, which inspires the shopping activity, was met successfully [3]. The recognition of e-commerce sites as a means to attain utilitarian ends permeates past studies [e.g., 10,29,45,[54][55][56][57][58][59][60]. Findings have attested to the importance of rational motives (e.g., perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use) in determining customers' willingness to transact via e-commerce sites. Specifically, prior research has isolated transactional functionalities, which support customers in acquiring products/services, as being instrumental to the attainment of utilitarian outcomes during online shopping. Cenfetelli et al. [24] proved that the functional quality of e-commerce sites, as represented by the breadth and depth of supportive transactional functionalities from pre-to post-consumption stages, plays a pivotal role in shaping customers' cognitive attitudes towards online shopping. Utilitarian disconfirmation is hence conceived in this study as a customer's evaluation of the extent to which the functional performance of an ecommerce site fails to match their utilitarian expectations. Due to an abundance of research testifying to the impact of expectation disconfirmation on satisfaction [see 61 for a comprehensive review], we hypothesize that customers' utilitarian expectations will be negatively disconfirmed if the functional performance of an e-commerce site fails to match their expectations, thereby culminating in feelings of low satisfaction with the functional elements of the site: Hypothesis 3: A customer's utilitarian disconfirmation with an e-commerce site is negatively related to their utilitarian satisfaction with the site.Utilitarian value has been the center of attention for much of the research conducted in the area of consumer behavior [59].

        <p>According to Bitner [76], a series of psychological triggers is responsible for ascertaining customers' satisfaction with consumption encounters, the most salient of which is the set of intrinsic expectations that every customer brings to a transaction [39,77]. Bitner [76] noted that customers' expectations are one of the principal drivers behind dissatisfactory service encounters: "if expectations exceed performance, dissatisfaction results" (p. 70). Conceivably, it is harder to satisfy customers with higher levels of pre-conceived expectations as they are more likely to report a disconfirmation with their expectations. The same inference can be made in the context of e-commerce transactions. Cenfetelli et al. [24] reached an identical conclusion by empirically demonstrating that transactional functionalities made available on e-commerce sites must meet customers' service expectations to be effective in fostering system usage behaviors.According to Bitner [76], a series of psychological triggers is responsible for ascertaining customers' satisfaction with consumption encounters, the most salient of which is the set of intrinsic expectations that every customer brings to a transaction [39,77].

        <p>In line with ECT, utilitarian expectations denote a baseline for judging the functional performance of an e-commerce site. For this reason, the higher the utilitarian expectations of customers, the more likely these expectations will be negatively disconfirmed: it is harder for the functional performance of an e-commerce site to satisfy a customer with high expectations, and vice versa [38,41]. Arguably, the higher expectations a customer attaches to each of the seven utilitarian expectations, the more tenuous it will be for an ecommerce site to satisfy their expectations [38][39][40][41].

The eight pedals are consultation and advice, order taking, payment, specific information, caretaking and safekeeping, billing, handling exceptions, and hospitality. Grounded in Lovelock's [90] supplementary service model, we explicate the spectrum of transactional functionalities that shape customers' evaluation of functional performance (see Table 2). Drawing on Dimoka et al.'s [93] delineation between seller and product uncertainties, we distinguish between general and specific information, resulting in a typology with nine dimensions.Lovelock [90] formalized an elaborate model consisting of eight 'pedals' of supplementary services, which "capture the complete range of supplementary services generally associated with products and services" [45, p.427; see also 81].

        <p>Comparatively, the epicurean aspects of shopping have received far less attention in extant literature [3,62]. Unlike utilitarian value, hedonic value is more personal and subjective in that it is realized through the amount of entertainment experienced in the shopping process [94]. Hedonic value thus reflects the emotional worth to be gained by customers in performing the shopping activity [4,95]. Here, "the purchase of goods may be incidental to the experience of shopping. People buy so they can shop, not shop so they can buy" [85, p. 428]. Vicarious consumption can grant hedonic value by enabling customers to gain gratification without committing to any actual purchases [60,97,98] even though the act of purchasing products or services can also produce hedonic value and may at times, serve as the climax of the entire shopping experience [3].Comparatively, the epicurean aspects of shopping have received far less attention in extant literature [3,62].

        <p>Another common source of hedonic value is derived from bargains where the discrepancy between the selling price of a product and the internal reference price of a customer extends beyond functional utility to foster feelings of anxiety and excitement [100]. Indeed, affective emotions such as increased arousal, heightened involvement, perceived freedom, fantasy fulfillment, and escapism have been found to be indicative of a hedonically charged shopping experience [63,101]. Flow-the holistic experience that people feel when they act with total involvement [102]-is another hedonically-driven motive that has been shown to be predictive of customers' adoption of e-commerce sites [e.g., 32,[93][94][95][96][97]. Other hedonic aspects of online shopping that have attracted similar scholarly attention include arousal [10,108], cognitive absorption [42,109], fun [110,111], mystery [112,113], playfulness [109,114], pleasure [108] and stimulation [115].

        <p>From the unlabeled sorting exercise described earlier, three dimensions of aesthetic properties (i.e., social presence, media vividness and atmospheric cues) were consolidated (see Appendix B). Social presence-"the extent to which a medium allows users to experience others as psychologically present" [114, p. 11]-refers to the capacity of communication medium to transmit information richness [129] and has been proven to positively influence the aesthetic performance of online shopping experiences by fostering a psychological connection between e-commerce sites and customers in order to encourage feelings of warmth and sociability towards the former much like human contact [9,12,17,18,21,120,130,131]. Conversely, Griffith et al. [104] noted that media vividness (i.e., engaging and interactive user interface) is critical in retaining customers' involvement during online shopping. It can thus be inferred that media vividness impacts customers' evaluation of the aesthetic performance of e-commerce sites through cultivating an immersive online shopping experience [13,14,26,105,113,120,121,130].

Karahanna et al. [51] found that ease of use, image, visibility, results demonstrability, and visibility are deemed to be crucial for initial IT use. Extrapolating to the e-commerce context, novice customers are likely to form higher utilitarian expectations about an e-commerce site by focusing on the perception of the ease of use, image, visibility, and results demonstrability. Due to insufficient prior experience, novice customers with lower transactional frequency are likely to rely on more accessible and peripheral functionalities to calibrate their utilitarian expectations of an e-commerce site. For instance, these customers could expect more utilitarian gains from using an e-commerce site that is cognitively less demanding, such as having accessible images, being more popular, and generates more communicable payoffs.

        <p>Conversely, seasoned customers who transact more frequently on an e-commerce site focus on different functionalities in calibrating their utilitarian expectations. According to Karahanna et al. [51], users with more experience of IT usage focus more on instrumentality beliefs, such as relative advantages, compatibility, and voluntariness. In other words, relative advantage, compatibility, and voluntariness likely play a more salient role in swaying more experienced customers' utilitarian expectations. Since seasoned customers also tend to be exposed to multiple e-commerce sites, their utilitarian expectations are likely to be construed comparatively. In other words, experienced customers will leverage on their extensive prior experience as an anchor point to adjust their utilitarian expectations towards an e-commerce site [138]. Therefore, functionalities gearing towards competitive advantages (i.e., relative advantage and compatibility) as well as freedom of choice (i.e., voluntariness of use) are likely to be more salient in affecting seasoned customers' utilitarian expectations.

        <p>Online shopping can be deemed to be risky for those who with little online shopping experience [139].

        <p>Specifically, consultation and advice, caretaking and safekeeping, and hospitality are functionalities that will appeal to novice customers when learning to transact on an ecommerce site.

        <p>As customers become more familiar with online shopping, they tend to ignore functionalities perceived to be important at the early stage of adopting an e-commerce site, and focus their attention on core functionalities for online shopping in the likes of product information, payment, delivery, and navigation [137,140]. As transactional frequency increases, customers are likely to shift their focus to core functionalities that are essential to successful transacting on an e-commerce site when evaluating its functional performance. For instance, general information, order taking, payment, specific information, billing, and handling exceptions are functionalities that are more relevant to the core transaction-oriented services offered by e-commerce sites. Seasoned customers who transact more frequently can leverage on their experience to better isolate functionalities that will directly contribute to the success of transactions (i.e., general information, order taking, payment, specific information, and billing) when evaluating functional performance. In addition, the increased transactional frequency is also likely to lead to more unexpected instances, thus highlighting the role of handling exceptions in determining functional performance.

        <p>According to Experiential Learning Theory (ELT) [141], customers will learn from doing (i.e., direct experience) and derive meaning from direct experience, which in turn can alter their beliefs and behavioral actions. As Venkatesh et al. [142] stated, when customers begin to use a technology, they can be more excitable by the innovativeness and novelty. As consumers' usage becomes more frequent, the novelty effect can wear off. The same can be said for the formation of hedonic expectations in e-commerce. Novice customers with lower transactional frequency tend to focus on the excitement of their online shopping experience, such as the novelty and innovativeness of e-commerce sites. Novice customers are more susceptible to being stimulated since transacting on an e-commerce site feels more novel to them. For this reason, less experienced customers could extract more hedonic value from an e-commerce site with higher level of excitability, and the reverse is true for their counterparts with higher online transactional frequency.

        <p>On the other hand, seasoned customers are likely to face less hurdles in the process of online shopping because of their increased familiarity with the e-commerce site. Customers with higher transactional frequency are more involved in and in control of the shopping process on an e-commerce site. As alleged by Hausman [143], online shopping is a "surrogate for more primal types of hunting and the search and acquisition of goods are the reward, not any utility resulting from the purchase" for customers with more online shopping experience [p. 407]. In other words, they have higher expectations on the perceived enjoyment and flow experience in online shopping compared to those with less shopping experience. Thus, when calibrating their hedonic expectations, seasoned customers are hence more likely to focus on the enjoyment and flow they experienced in their past transactions.

        <p>With regards to aesthetic properties, customers with varying transactional frequencies are also expected to value them differently. Those who transact less frequently are likely to be drawn towards peripheral and generic aesthetic properties such as social presence and atmospheric cues. Due to the lack of experience with e-commerce sites, novice customers could rely on the presence of fellow customers as well as decorative elements in assessing the aesthetic performance of an e-commerce site. Consequently, the impacts posed by social presence and atmospheric cues on aesthetic performance are expected to be strengthened as transactional frequency reduces.

        <p>ELT [141] posits that what customers learned from their direct experience can shape their beliefs and actions. Consequently, customers with a lower transactional frequency tend to form utilitarian and hedonic expectations in a distinct manner compared to those who with higher transactional frequency, the impact exerted by expectations on disconfirmations are expected to be also shaped by transactional frequency. Although prior research reported negative relationships between expectations and disconfirmations, Yi [75] found that the relationship between expectations and disconfirmation can be complex and the effect of expectations on disconfirmation might be mixed.ELT [141] posits that what customers learned from their direct experience can shape their beliefs and actions.

        <p>To illustrate, novice customers are less likely to have their expectations disconfirmed since their expectations are less related to core services offered by e-commerce sites [137,140]. Therefore, customers who transact less frequently are more lenient and tolerant to the actual performance of an e-commerce site if it is able to deliver a favorable impression, resulting in an attenuating moderating effect on the relationships between expectation and disconfirmation for both its utilitarian and hedonic aspects.To illustrate, novice customers are less likely to have their expectations disconfirmed since their expectations are less related to core services offered by e-commerce sites [137,140].

        <p>The same goes for the relationships between performance evaluations and disconfirmations. Following the rationale offered by Yi [75] on the mixed effect of expectations on disconfirmations, it is not unreasonable to assume that the relationships between performance evaluations and disconfirmations may not always be negative. That is, discrepancies in transactional frequency could give rise to variance in the impact exerted by performance evaluations on disconfirmations. As mentioned above, novice customers often rely on peripheral and facilitating functionalities as proxies for evaluating the performance of an e-commerce site due to their lack of experience. Therefore, novice customers are likely to deem how well they were eased into an e-commerce site as indicative of its performance and avoid risks. Through proper acclimatization, novice customers are become better educated in assessing the outcomes of transacting with this site. In turn, these customers are sensitized to unexpected and underperformed instances when interacting with an e-commerce site, driving up their disconfirmations. As a result, novice customers' performance evaluations culminate in increased disconfirmations for both the utilitarian and hedonic aspects of the e-commerce site.The same goes for the relationships between performance evaluations and disconfirmations.

        <p>Given the predominantly Internet-savvy target audience, we opted for an electronic survey during data collection [146]. An online questionnaire is crafted and circulated among graduate students and faculty members to solicit feedback on its format and presentation. This initial review is crucial in establishing the clarity of survey instructions, as there will not be any face-to-face interaction between investigators and respondents. We also assessed the proper functioning of the survey questionnaire across a variety of browsers (e.g., 
            <rs type="software">Google Chrome</rs>, 
            <rs type="creator">Microsoft</rs>
            <rs type="software">Internet Explorer</rs>, Mozilla

        <p>Survey respondents are requested to assess an e-commerce site for which they have performed a transaction within the last six months [see 10]. Each site is evaluated based on the transactional functionalities and aesthetic properties offered relative to the individual's utilitarian and hedonic expectations as well as their perceptions of the remaining seven cognitive constructs (i.e., functional performance, aesthetic performance, utilitarian disconfirmation, hedonic disconfirmation, utilitarian satisfaction, hedonic satisfaction and overall satisfaction). One of the challenges in web data collection is in the computation of non-response bias because it is difficult to keep track of multiple submissions by the same respondent or the contamination of the data sample by outsiders [146]. Fortunately, because respondents are recruited from a class of 387 students, we obtain a response rate of 82.95% (321/387). After deleting another 18 responses due to data runs, we arrive at an eventual sample of 303 (78.29%) data points for analysis. On average, the sample consists of 145 (or 47.85%) females who carry out e-commerce transactions at least once a month.Survey respondents are requested to assess an e-commerce site for which they have performed a transaction within the last six months [see 10].

        <p>Specifically, this study is an extension of the EDT and the main goal of this study is to examine key determinants of customers' expectations, performance evaluation, and satisfaction with e-commerce sites and the moderating effect of online shopping experience (i.e., transactional frequency) on various established relationships from an expectation disconfirmation perspective. In this sense, the premise of our research resonates with Hair et al.'s [159] recommendation of PLS as a data analytical technique in SEM that is appropriate for studies which aim to predict focal constructs or identify key drivers by extending an existing theory. Second, the proposed theoretical model combines both formative and reflective constructs and as alluded to by Chin [160,161], PLS excels in dealing with formative constructs.Specifically, this study is an extension of the EDT and the main goal of this study is to examine key determinants of customers' expectations, performance evaluation, and satisfaction with e-commerce sites and the moderating effect of online shopping experience (i.e., transactional frequency) on various established relationships from an expectation disconfirmation perspective.

        <p>Unlike functional and aesthetic performance which reflect holistic evaluations of the performance of transactional functionalities and aesthetic properties on e-commerce sites [162], each dimension of utilitarian and hedonic expectations can manifest independently of one another: just because a customer expects an e-commerce to be easy to use does not necessarily imply that they expect the site to improve their image as well. Consequently, the manifestation of any one specific dimension of utilitarian expectations or hedonic expectations is not indicative of the presence of another, be it Moore and Benbasat's [78] technological innovation characteristics or the notions of enjoyability, excitability and flow as synthesized from extant literature in this study.Unlike functional and aesthetic performance which reflect holistic evaluations of the performance of transactional functionalities and aesthetic properties on e-commerce sites [162], each dimension of utilitarian and hedonic expectations can manifest independently of one another: just because a customer expects an e-commerce to be easy to use does not necessarily imply that they expect the site to improve their image as well.

        <p>The verification of the measurement model involves the estimation of internal consistency as well as the convergent and discriminant validity of the measurement items included in our survey instrument. Because reflective items capture the effects of the construct under scrutiny [163], internal consistency can be assessed through standard estimates of Cronbach's alpha [145], composite reliability and the Average Variance Extracted (AVE) [164]. After dropping 10 measurement items due to low factor loadings (i.e., &lt; .70), the latent constructs exceed prescribed thresholds (see Appendix D), thus supporting convergent validity. To determine discriminant validity, the square root of the AVE for each construct was compared against its correlations with other constructs [164].The verification of the measurement model involves the estimation of internal consistency as well as the convergent and discriminant validity of the measurement items included in our survey instrument.

        <p>For the criterion of discriminant validity to hold, the square root of the AVE for each construct should be greater than its correlations with any other construct. Based on the inter-construct correlation matrix generated from PLS, all constructs display sufficient discriminant validity (see Appendix E). Of the 406 unique bivariate correlations 1 among the 29 latent constructs in our measurement model, only 3 pairs (1%) surpass the 0.70 mark for the dataset, and even then, their values are still much lower than the square root of intra-construct AVE for each (see Appendix E). This indicates that respondents are able to distinguish among the constructs in our theoretical model when answering the survey questionnaire. Convergent and discriminant validity are further confirmed when individual items load above 0.5 on their associated factors (see Appendix D).For the criterion of discriminant validity to hold, the square root of the AVE for each construct should be greater than its correlations with any other construct.

        <p>( ) From our data analysis, majority of hypothesized relationships are substantiated by the empirical evidence. As postulated, utilitarian satisfaction (β = 0.60, p &lt; 0.001) and hedonic satisfaction (β = 0.23, p &lt; 0.001) exert positive and significant effects on customers' overall satisfaction towards e-commerce sites, explaining 61% of variance in the latter and substantiating hypotheses 1 and 2. In turn, utilitarian disconfirmation (β = -0.22, p &lt; 0.001) and hedonic disconfirmation (β = -0.34, p &lt; 0.001) have significantly negative impacts on utilitarian satisfaction and hedonic satisfaction respectively, thus corroborating hypotheses 3 and 9. Further, functional performance (β = 0.51, p &lt; 0.001) and aesthetic performance (β = 0.44, p &lt; 0.001) exert positive and significant effects on utilitarian satisfaction and hedonic satisfaction, which when combined with their corresponding disconfirmation constructs, account for 34% and 29% of variance explained in utilitarian satisfaction and hedonic satisfaction respectively. This reinforces hypotheses 7 and 13. Functional performance has a significantly negative impact on utilitarian disconfirmation (β = -0.12, p &lt; 0.01) whereas aesthetic performance has a weakly significant positive relationship with hedonic disconfirmation (β = 0.08, p &lt; 0.10). Hypothesis 6 is hence supported whereas hypothesis 12 is not. Contrary to our anticipations, utilitarian expectations exert significantly negative effect on utilitarian disconfirmation (β = -0.10, p &lt; 0.05) whereas hedonic expectations have no effect on hedonic disconfirmation. Hypotheses 4 and 10 are unsupported. Combining expectations and performance constructs, our model explains only 3% and 1% of variance in utilitarian disconfirmation and hedonic disconfirmation. The low variance explained of utilitarian disconfirmation can be attributed to the marginal effect of functional performance on utilitarian disconfirmation and the insignificant impact of utilitarian expectations on utilitarian disconfirmation (see Figure 2). Likewise, as shown in Figure 2, the low variance explained of hedonic disconfirmation is due to the insignificant effect of hedonic expectations and aesthetic performance on hedonic disconfirmation (see Figure 2). Consistent with hypotheses 5 and 11, utilitarian expectations (β = 0.12, p &lt; 0.01) and hedonic expectations (β = 0.16, p &lt; 0.001) have positive and significant impacts on functional performance and aesthetic performance. Of the seven constituent dimensions comprising the second-order aggregate construct of utilitarian expectations, most are significantly positive contributors except for image (β = 0.03, p &gt; 0.05) and visibility (β = -0.10, p &lt; 0.05). Conversely, enjoyability (β = 0.39, p &lt; 0.001), excitability (β = 0.41, p &lt; 0.001) and flow (β = 0.38, p &lt; 0.001) are positive and significant contributors to the second-order aggregate construct of hedonic expectations. With the exception of general information (β = -0.10, p &lt; 0.05), payment (β = 0.03, p &gt; 0.05), specific information (β = 0.06, p &gt; 0.05) as well as caretaking and safekeeping (β = -0.10, p &lt; 0.05), the remaining five transactional functionalities exert significantly positive effects on functional performance. Together with the aggregate construct of utilitarian expectations, we observe 44% of variance explained in the latter. Consequently, hypothesis 8 is partially validated. In line with hypothesis 14, atmospheric cues (β = 0.14, p &lt; 0.001), media vividness (β = 0.27, p &lt; 0.001) and social presence (β = 0.20, p &lt; 0.001) have positive and significant impacts on aesthetic performance. Coupled with the aggregate construct of hedonic expectations, 33% of variance is accounted for in the latter through our model.( ) From our data analysis, majority of hypothesized relationships are substantiated by the empirical evidence.

        <p>Accordingly, we stratified our sample into three groups on the basis of the transactional frequency. The group consisting of customers who transact more than once per month is labelled as high frequency. The Low frequency group comprises customers who transact less than once per 6 months. All remaining customers are categorized into the group labelled medium frequency. Next, we divide the entire sample into three datasets based on these categorizations (i.e., high, medium, and low frequencies). We then evaluated our hypothesized moderating effects by comparing path coefficients estimated with each of these datasets. The analytical results are summarized in Table 7 below. For each hypothesized relationship where customers' transactional frequency demonstrates a statistically significant effect, its moderating effects are plotted in Appendix F. Together, the analytical results and graphical plots offer a comprehensive picture of the moderating effects of transactional frequency.Accordingly, we stratified our sample into three groups on the basis of the transactional frequency.

        <p>As customers transact less frequently, the positive influence exerted by ease of use on utilitarian expectations and those positive influences by consultation and advice, caretaking and safekeeping, hospitality on functional performance are strengthened, validating Hypotheses 15a, 17a, 17b, and 17c. Likewise, the positive effect of excitability on hedonic expectations is strengthened as transactional frequency decreases, substantiating Hypothesis 19. Furthermore, the decrease in transactional frequency also reinforces the negative relationship between utilitarian expectations and utilitarian disconfirmation, supporting Hypothesis 23a.As customers transact less frequently, the positive influence exerted by ease of use on utilitarian expectations and those positive influences by consultation and advice, caretaking and safekeeping, hospitality on functional performance are strengthened, validating Hypotheses 15a, 17a, 17b, and 17c.

        <p>On the other hand, as transactional frequency increases, the positive influences posed by relative advantage, compatibility, and voluntariness of use on utilitarian expectations are strengthened, validating Hypotheses 16a to 16c. Similarly, the positive impacts induced by general information, order taking, payment, specific information, billing, and handling of exceptions on functional performance are enhanced when customers transact more frequently, substantiating Hypotheses 18a to 18f. Further, the positive relationship between flow and hedonic expectations and that between media vividness and aesthetic performance are strengthened when transactional frequency is high, supporting Hypotheses 20b and 22. Last but not least, high transactional frequency also alleviates the effect of functional performance and aesthetic performance on utilitarian disconfirmation and hedonic disconfirmation respectively thus supporting Hypotheses 24a and 24b.On the other hand, as transactional frequency increases, the positive influences posed by relative advantage, compatibility, and voluntariness of use on utilitarian expectations are strengthened, validating Hypotheses 16a to 16c.

        <p>Building on the EDT, we construct and test a theoretical model of online consumption behaviors that distinguishes between utilitarian and hedonic elements of e-commerce sites as core determinants of customer satisfaction and examines the moderating influence of the different levels of customers' online e-commerce experience on the relationships between customers' perceived presence of functionalities and their expectations and performance perceptions for an e-commerce site and their impacts on expectation disconfirmations.

        <p>First, out of the seven utilitarian expectations, image and visibility are not found to be crucial determinants of customers' utilitarian expectations towards e-commerce sites. Such an observation contradicts the work of Moore and Benbasat [78] in that these seven utilitarian expectations supposedly capture the range of benefits one hopes to gain from the utilization of technological innovations.

        <p>an appeal of e-commerce sites stems from preserving customers' anonymity during online transactions. By the same rationale, customers of e-commerce sites, due to their preferences for transactional anonymity, are less likely to expect visibility and one's image improvements for online shopping.an appeal of e-commerce sites stems from preserving customers' anonymity during online transactions.

        <p>Transactional frequency is found to moderate the impact of relative advantages, ease of use, compatibility, and voluntariness of use on customers' utilitarian expectations associated with e-commerce sites. Specifically, relative advantages, compatibility, and voluntariness of use exert stronger positive impacts on customers' utilitarian expectations of e-commerce sites for customers with high transactional frequency than it does for customers with less transactional frequency. On the flip side, the results only show that there is an increase in the strength of the impact of ease of use (among the other dimensions) on utilitarian expectations for customers with low transactional frequency.Transactional frequency is found to moderate the impact of relative advantages, ease of use, compatibility, and voluntariness of use on customers' utilitarian expectations associated with e-commerce sites.

        <p>customers with a relatively lower transactional frequency calibrate their expectations from the generic peripheral functionalities, such as a perception of how easy it is to use an electronic service. When customers are not familiar with the site, they expect the site to be easy to use and less cognitively demanding in carrying out online shopping. As frequency of usage increases, their expectations for functionalities will shift to more specific ones pertaining to core services, such as relative advantages, compatibility and voluntariness of use.customers with a relatively lower transactional frequency calibrate their expectations from the generic peripheral functionalities, such as a perception of how easy it is to use an electronic service.

        <p>Secondly, payment, general information and specific information are not explanatory of functional performance for e-commerce sites. As maintained by Chen and Dubinsky [167], the provision of irrelevant information contributes to information overload and excessive cognitive processing on the part of customers during online shopping. For this reason, customers could deem general information to be redundant due to the demand for additional cognitive processing. This is also consistent with our empirical findings whereby general information exerts a significant negative impact on functional performance especially for customers with a low transactional frequency. Although the provision of specific information seems to have no significant impact on functional performance, our moderation test result suggests that specific information could be irrelevant for customers with less online shopping experience where benefiting the functional performance for those who with high transactional frequency.Secondly, payment, general information and specific information are not explanatory of functional performance for e-commerce sites.

        <p>The findings on payment as an insignificant determinant of functional performance might be due to the maturity of the payment systems in e-commerce in meeting customers' demand for payment service. Thus payment might have become somewhat unconsciously invisible in a customer's evaluation of the functional performance of e-commerce sites.The findings on payment as an insignificant determinant of functional performance might be due to the maturity of the payment systems in e-commerce in meeting customers' demand for payment service.

        <p>Nonetheless, for customers with moderate online shopping experience, payment still exerts a positive impact on their evaluations for the functional performance of an e-commerce site.Nonetheless, for customers with moderate online shopping experience, payment still exerts a positive impact on their evaluations for the functional performance of an e-commerce site.</p>
        <p>The moderating effect of transactional frequency is significant for each path of the nine determinants to the functional performance of e-commerce sites. Consultation and advice, caretaking and safekeeping, and hospitality exert stronger positive impact on customers' perceived functional performance of an e-commerce site for customers with less shopping experience than it does for those who with more. Also we found there is a stronger effect of general information, order taking, payment, specific information, billing, and handling exceptions on customers' perceived functional performance among those with more transactional frequencies.The moderating effect of transactional frequency is significant for each path of the nine determinants to the functional performance of e-commerce sites.

        <p>Third, our empirical investigation reveals enjoyability, excitability, and flow as three crucial determinants of customers' hedonic expectations towards e-commerce sites. Again we found that shopping experience does indeed moderate the impacts of excitability and flow on customers' hedonic expectations. Specifically, excitability greatly raises hedonic expectations hold by customers with a lower transactional frequency whereas flow significantly lowers their hedonic expectations. Conversely, seasoned customers the effect of excitability on their hedonic expectations wears off whereas flow starts to contribute to elevating their hedonic expectations.Third, our empirical investigation reveals enjoyability, excitability, and flow as three crucial determinants of customers' hedonic expectations towards e-commerce sites.

        <p>Forth, atmospheric cues, media vividness, and social presence are found to be positively related to the aesthetic performance of e-commerce sites. Media vividness exerts stronger positive impact on customers' evaluation of the aesthetic performance of ecommerce sites among customer with higher transactional frequency. Nonetheless, transactional frequency is found to exert no moderating effects on the relationships between atmospheric cues as well as social presence and evaluation of aesthetic performance of e-commerce sites.Forth, atmospheric cues, media vividness, and social presence are found to be positively related to the aesthetic performance of e-commerce sites.

        <p>Fifth, our empirical investigation shows that in our original research model, utilitarian expectations exert negative impact on utilitarian disconfirmation, whereas hedonic expectations have no significant impact on hedonic disconfirmation. Utilitarian expectations are found to exert increasing negative impacts on customers' utilitarian disconfirmation with e-commerce sites as transactional frequency decreases. Meanwhile, there is no significant difference in the impact of hedonic expectations on hedonic disconfirmation for customers despite their different transactional frequencies.Fifth, our empirical investigation shows that in our original research model, utilitarian expectations exert negative impact on utilitarian disconfirmation, whereas hedonic expectations have no significant impact on hedonic disconfirmation.

Meanwhile, there is no significant difference in the impact of hedonic expectations on hedonic disconfirmation for customers despite their different transactional frequencies.</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, hedonic expectations exert no significant impact on hedonic disconfirmation for customers with low and high transactional frequencies yet demonstrate a significant negative impact for those with a medium frequency. Though the negative relationships between expectations and disconfirmation violate the premise of the EDT, these observations may be attributable to customers' tendency to avoid cognitive dissonance.Surprisingly, hedonic expectations exert no significant impact on hedonic disconfirmation for customers with low and high transactional frequencies yet demonstrate a significant negative impact for those with a medium frequency. Though the negative relationships between expectations and disconfirmation violate the premise of the EDT, these observations may be attributable to customers' tendency to avoid cognitive dissonance.</p>
        <p>According to the cognitive dissonance theory [168], individuals tend to withdraw from beliefs leading to inconsistencies in cognition and are inherently compelled to alter their perceptions to attain mental alignment. Consequently, customers with high utilitarian and hedonic expectations may exhibit propensities to confirm rather than disconfirm their expectations of e-commerce sites in order to evade circumstances of cognitive dissonance.According to the cognitive dissonance theory [168], individuals tend to withdraw from beliefs leading to inconsistencies in cognition and are inherently compelled to alter their perceptions to attain mental alignment. Consequently, customers with high utilitarian and hedonic expectations may exhibit propensities to confirm rather than disconfirm their expectations of e-commerce sites in order to evade circumstances of cognitive dissonance.</p>
        <p>This explanation is further corroborated by from our moderator analysis whereby customers, who transact less frequently on e-commerce sites, are less likely to report a disconfirmation with their expectations: they tend to give e-commerce sites the benefit of the doubt in terms of performance due to unfamiliarity. Likewise, the same reasoning can be applied to our observation in that functional performance exerts an increasingly negative impact on utilitarian disconfirmation while aesthetic performance induces negative influence on hedonic disconfirmation with e-commerce sites for customers with medium and high transactional frequencies and positive influence for those with low transactional frequency. That is, frequent customers, due to their familiarity with ecommerce sites, are capable of maximizing the utility to be gleaned from these sites.This explanation is further corroborated by from our moderator analysis whereby customers, who transact less frequently on e-commerce sites, are less likely to report a disconfirmation with their expectations: they tend to give e-commerce sites the benefit of the doubt in terms of performance due to unfamiliarity.

        <p>Therefore, frequent customers possess more realistic expectations of the performance of ecommerce sites and as such, are less likely to encounter situations whereby their expectations would be negatively disconfirmed by these sites.Therefore, frequent customers possess more realistic expectations of the performance of ecommerce sites and as such, are less likely to encounter situations whereby their expectations would be negatively disconfirmed by these sites.</p>
        <p>From a theoretical standpoint, this paper contributes to extant literature in five ways.From a theoretical standpoint, this paper contributes to extant literature in five ways.</p>
        <p>First, this study contributes to the operationalization of customer satisfaction with online shopping sites by disentangling both the hedonic and utilitarian satisfaction in online shopping based on EDT. This study answers to the call for research on adequately reflecting of the full online shopping experience including both utilitarian and hedonic facets. It enriches prior research findings on user satisfaction in online shopping by highlighting the importance of hedonic performance of e-commerce sites in predicting hedonic satisfaction that will also lead to users' overall satisfaction together with utilitarian satisfaction. It also offers clear guideline on the design of e-commerce sites that provides good hedonic and utilitarian performance and meet customers' expectations in online shopping.First, this study contributes to the operationalization of customer satisfaction with online shopping sites by disentangling both the hedonic and utilitarian satisfaction in online shopping based on EDT.

        <p>Second, this study extends the EDT by delineating customer satisfaction of ecommerce sites into utilitarian and hedonic elements that are founded on customers' expectations as well as the functional and aesthetic performance of these sites. Specifically, the reconceptualization of the monolithic disconfirmation construct underscores the baseline from which expectations are contrasted with performance (i.e., functional performance for utilitarian expectations and aesthetic performance for hedonic expectations).Second, this study extends the EDT by delineating customer satisfaction of ecommerce sites into utilitarian and hedonic elements that are founded on customers' expectations as well as the functional and aesthetic performance of these sites. Specifically, the reconceptualization of the monolithic disconfirmation construct underscores the baseline from which expectations are contrasted with performance (i.e., functional performance for utilitarian expectations and aesthetic performance for hedonic expectations).</p>
        <p>Third, we further found that unsubstantiated hypotheses in our theoretical model are, to a large extent, caused by design preferences due to customers' familiarity with ecommerce sites. As highlighted in the moderator analysis, most of our hypothesized relationships remain invariant to customers' transactional frequency, thereby attesting to the robustness of our theoretical model. This is especially apparent for our proposed typologies of utilitarian and hedonic expectations in that the importance of these expectations (or lack thereof) remains constant regardless of customers' transactional frequency. Indeed, our study is the first of its kind to prove that hypothesized relationships enshrined in the original EDT are more likely to hold for repeated rather than initial customers. This bears important implications for future research in that scholars cannot ignore users' familiarity with technology as a potential moderator of their acceptance decisions.Third, we further found that unsubstantiated hypotheses in our theoretical model are, to a large extent, caused by design preferences due to customers' familiarity with ecommerce sites.

        <p>Forth, given that both utilitarian and hedonic expectations are multi-dimensional constructs, this study proposes separate typologies that delineate the two constructs into their respective constituent dimensions. The sub-dimensions for utilitarian expectations stem from Moore and Benbasat's [78] adaptation of Rogers' [79] IDT whereas hedonic expectations are split into its sub-dimensions based on an inductive classification of extant literature. We hope that our proposed typologies can bring clarity to the vast amount of extant e-commerce literature, which give rise to diverse and often contradictory views on what customers expect from online shopping.Forth, given that both utilitarian and hedonic expectations are multi-dimensional constructs, this study proposes separate typologies that delineate the two constructs into their respective constituent dimensions.

        <p>Finally, this study identifies dimensions of transactional functionalities and aesthetic properties that translate into actionable design prescriptions for improving the functional and aesthetic performance of e-commerce sites respectively. While prescriptions for transactional functionalities were derived from Lovelock's [90] supplementary service model, our recommendations for aesthetic properties were synthesized from extant literature. Together, these dimensions of transactional functionalities and aesthetic properties represent a collection of generic design principles that can be applied in inquiries of various online transactional environments.Finally, this study identifies dimensions of transactional functionalities and aesthetic properties that translate into actionable design prescriptions for improving the functional and aesthetic performance of e-commerce sites respectively.

        <p>From a pragmatic standpoint, this study highlights the criticality of striking a balance in the design of e-commerce sites in order to satisfy both utilitarian and hedonic expectations. Our theoretical model therefore offers a preliminary glimpse into a holistic technological solution for promoting customer satisfaction towards e-commerce sites. An overemphasis on functional performance can easily lead to the creation of website functionalities which fulfill customers' utilitarian needs, but concurrently, e-merchants may miss out on any probable benefits arising from hedonically-driven shopping activities.From a pragmatic standpoint, this study highlights the criticality of striking a balance in the design of e-commerce sites in order to satisfy both utilitarian and hedonic expectations.

        <p>Conversely, enhancing aesthetic performance can entice potential customers to shop on the e-commerce site, but without the availability of transaction-oriented functionalities, it is practically impossible for customers to acquire desired products or services even if they wish to do so. To this end, this paper accomplishes four vital functions: (1) it derives separate typologies of utilitarian and hedonic expectations driving customers' evaluation of e-commerce sites; (2) it prescribes actionable design principles which could be leveraged by e-merchants to improve the functional and aesthetic performance of these sites; (3) it validates the practical value of these expectations and performance dimensions, and; (4) it sheds light on why certain expectations and performance dimensions may not be equally salient for the entire population of online shoppers.Conversely, enhancing aesthetic performance can entice potential customers to shop on the e-commerce site, but without the availability of transaction-oriented functionalities, it is practically impossible for customers to acquire desired products or services even if they wish to do so.

        <p>Our empirical findings thus inform the development of e-commerce sites in three ways. First, with the exception of image and visibility, our proposed typologies of utilitarian and hedonic expectations can assist e-merchants to better appreciate customers' motivation for transacting via e-commerce sites and tailor their business strategies accordingly. For instance, while e-commerce sites could appeal to customers through fulfilling their utilitarian and hedonic expectations, it should not happen at the expense of customers' anonymity. Second, our prescribed design principles could be harnessed by developers as an analytical toolkit from which to: (1) benchmark the functional and aesthetic performance of their e-commerce sites; (2) to pinpoint missing transactional functionalities and aesthetic properties which are deemed essential by customers; (3) to remove undesirable web elements (e.g., general and specific information), and (4) to decide whether features available on e-commerce sites are sufficient in fulfilling customers' utilitarian and hedonic expectations. Third, because the relevance of certain transactional functionalities varies with customers' transactional frequency, developers can profile customers and tailor e-commerce sites to match individual requirements. As maintained by Piccoli et al. [169], web technologies can simplify the transactional process by retaining reusable customer information. As such, profiling becomes a feasible solution for identifying repeated customers and personalizing the design of e-commerce sites to accentuate features tailored to their needs. E-commerce sites could better prioritize the provision of tailored transaction functionalities to accommodate the expectations of distinct customer groups to enhance their evaluation of the functional performance of ecommerce sites. For instance, e-merchants could prioritize personalized payment feature over consultation and advice as well as hospitality features for frequent customers.Our empirical findings thus inform the development of e-commerce sites in three ways.

        <p>Conversely, for non-frequent customers, especially those who access e-commerce sites less than once per six months, e-merchants could prioritize consultation and advice, order taking, and hospitality features over that of payment.Conversely, for non-frequent customers, especially those who access e-commerce sites less than once per six months, e-merchants could prioritize consultation and advice, order taking, and hospitality features over that of payment.</p>
        <p>There are five main limitations to this study, within which lie probable avenues for future research. First, our theoretical model caters exclusively to Business-to-Consumer (B2C) e-commerce and does not consider other online transactional environments such as Business-to-Business (B2B) e-commerce. Unlike B2C e-commerce, B2B e-commerce (e.g., electronic marketplaces) places greater emphasis on reduced transaction costs [170] and expanded opportunities for competitive sourcing [171]. For this reason, we speculate that the pertinence of hedonic dimensions in our theoretical model may not be as pronounced as those of utilitarian dimensions, an area for future research.There are five main limitations to this study, within which lie probable avenues for future research.

        <p>Second, this study primarily examines utilitarian and hedonic functionalities of ecommerce sites that support direct interaction between customers and e-merchants. For this reason, we do not consider other peripheral functionalities of e-commerce sites (e.g., social networking features). Additionally, we do not deny that utilitarian and hedonic consumption behaviors may influence each other. For instance, hedonic disconfirmation could affect utilitarian satisfaction whereas utilitarian disconfirmation might influence hedonic satisfaction. Nonetheless, excluding these relationships from our theoretical model aids in clarifying the impact of functionalities on customers' evaluation of e-commerce sites, the prime focus of this study. Future research could incorporate other tangential functionalities of e-commerce sites into our theoretical model and also investigate the interplay among differing consumption behaviors in online shopping.Second, this study primarily examines utilitarian and hedonic functionalities of ecommerce sites that support direct interaction between customers and e-merchants.

        <p>Third, due to our choice of perceptual measures for validating our theoretical model, our empirical findings may be subjected to response bias in that social desirability may affect how survey respondents react to the online questionnaire. While we have controlled for response bias by computing the amount of common method variance across measurement items, future research could explore ways of validating the theoretical model objectively. For instance, collaborations may be sought with e-merchants to obtain web analytics data that exposes the extent to which the transactional functionalities and aesthetic properties advocated in our theoretical model are utilized by customers of ecommerce sites.Third, due to our choice of perceptual measures for validating our theoretical model, our empirical findings may be subjected to response bias in that social desirability may affect how survey respondents react to the online questionnaire.

        <p>Nevertheless, as the primary objective of this paper is to validate the pragmatic significance of utilitarian and hedonic aspects of e-commerce sites, it would have been meaningless to survey respondents without prior exposure to online transactions. Still, we call for further empirical inquiries in the future to ascertain the predictability of our theoretical model for potential adopters.Nevertheless, as the primary objective of this paper is to validate the pragmatic significance of utilitarian and hedonic aspects of e-commerce sites, it would have been meaningless to survey respondents without prior exposure to online transactions.

        <p>Fifth, as we uncovered in our post-hoc analysis, transaction frequency moderates the effect of expectations on disconfirmation. It is meaningful to explore how the impact of customer expectations on disconfirmation will change with increased usage experience of e-commerce sites. We thus call for further empirical research that sheds light on the relationship between expectation and disconfirmation from a longitudinal standpoint.Fifth, as we uncovered in our post-hoc analysis, transaction frequency moderates the effect of expectations on disconfirmation.

        <p>Finally, our sample is drawn from a relatively homogenous population of online shoppers. We therefore caution against generalizing our empirical findings beyond customer populations that share similar demographic compositions. Past studies have attested to variations in design preferences of e-commerce sites across cultures [9,116]. As alleged by Weiss [172], cultural discrepancies in technology adoption can be traced to the effects of power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individualism, masculinity, and long-term orientation. We hence call for future research to incorporate cultural elements into our theoretical model in order to refine bolster its explanatory and predictive powers across cultures.Finally, our sample is drawn from a relatively homogenous population of online shoppers.

        <p>In summary, we approach the topic of customer satisfaction for e-commerce sites from its most primordial component, the duality of utilitarian and hedonic expectations as intrinsic motivations. We purport and test a model of e-commerce consumption behaviors that details the set of utilitarian and hedonic expectations, which should accompany any design blueprint of e-commerce sites to ensure a rewarding online shopping experience.In summary, we approach the topic of customer satisfaction for e-commerce sites from its most primordial component, the duality of utilitarian and hedonic expectations as intrinsic motivations.

        <p>Together with concerted investigative efforts in the future, we believe that our theoretical model will spawn a new genre of thinking with regards to how e-commerce technologies can be better structured to match behavioral motivations for customers during online shopping.Together with concerted investigative efforts in the future, we believe that our theoretical model will spawn a new genre of thinking with regards to how e-commerce technologies can be better structured to match behavioral motivations for customers during online shopping.</p>
