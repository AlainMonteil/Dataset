        <p>The main goal of this research was to analyze the three-way interactive effects of corporate social responsibility (CSR), green human resource management (GHRM), and responsible leadership on employee green behavior and task performance. Social cognition theory was adopted to explore the context-behavior-performance framework. The research hypotheses were tested using data from a survey of 261 Millennial employees in five-star hotels in China.The main goal of this research was to analyze the three-way interactive effects of corporate social responsibility (CSR), green human resource management (GHRM), and responsible leadership on employee green behavior and task performance.

        <p>The results indicated that the three-way interactive effect of CSR, GHRM, and responsible leadership on employee green behavior and performance was significant and positive. In addition, green behavior played a mediation role in this relationship after controlling the effect of organizational identity. This suggests that behavioral improvements are a better predictor of performance than perceptions of organizational identity. The analysis enriches the context-behavior-performance framework literature and highlights that organizations can enhance sustainability by implementing CSR, GHRM, and responsible leadership.The results indicated that the three-way interactive effect of CSR, GHRM, and responsible leadership on employee green behavior and performance was significant and positive.

        <p>Employee green behavior is being encouraged in more organizations as a result of today's increasing environmental and resource use concerns, and the implementation of more human resource management (GHRM) and responsible leadership (Aguinis &amp; Glavas, 2019). Surprisingly, the current literature focuses on the independent effect of CSR on green behavior (Su &amp; Swanson, 2019;Shen &amp; Benson, 2016;Tian &amp; Robertson, 2019). However, the implementation of CSR policies and strategies are impacted by HRM and leadership actions (Aguinis &amp; Glavas, 2019). CSR reflects policies to promote environmental protection and resource conservation (Su &amp; Swanson, 2019), while GHRM represents formal HR practices, and responsible leadership represents informal personal power to influence employee green behavior (Leroy et al., 2018). CSR comprises organizational policies; GHRM and responsible leadership represent practices and actions providing organizational contexts for staff behavior (Chan et al., 2014;Kim et al., 2019). These contexts need to be examined more broadly to detect potential synergies as envisaged in this research (Hu et al., 2011).Employee green behavior is being encouraged in more organizations as a result of today's increasing environmental and resource use concerns, and the implementation of more human resource management (GHRM) and responsible leadership (Aguinis &amp; Glavas, 2019).

        <p>HRM and leadership may strengthen the effects of CSR in organizations (Aguinis &amp; Glavas, 2019;Farrington et al., 2017;Norton et al., 2015). The effectiveness of CSR policies is influenced by managerial practices and actions. This research highlights the effects of GHRM and responsible leadership because they value environmental protection and support pre-environment actions through systematic programming and personnel coaching and training. GHRM and responsible leadership are among the practices that affect employee green behavior through formal organizational systems and informal personal relationships (Leroy et al., 2018). Therefore, it is worthwhile and necessary to examine the interactive effect of these three important aspects of organizations.HRM and leadership may strengthen the effects of CSR in organizations (Aguinis &amp; Glavas, 2019;Farrington et al., 2017;Norton et al., 2015).

        <p>In addition, the mediating effect of employee green behavior was explored in this analysis. It is not yet completely known how CSR impacts employee performance. Most previous research has examined the positive relationships between CSR and employee performance based on social identification perspectives (Kim et al., 2019;Martínez et al., 2014;Raub &amp; Blunschi, 2014). However, organizational identification emphasizes employee perceptions of organizational images based upon company policies and actions (Cheema et al., 2020;Norton et al., 2015). Further research efforts are needed to determine the effects of CSR, GHRM, and responsible leadership in improving and motivating green behavior leading to performance according to social cognition theory (Bandura, 1986;Chen et al., 2015). To bridge this literature gap, this research explored the three-way interactive effect of CSR, GHRM, and responsible leadership on individual performance through green behavior.In addition, the mediating effect of employee green behavior was explored in this analysis.

        <p>With a focus on antecedents of green behavior (Ahmed et al., 2020;Dumont et al., 2017;Kim et al., 2019;Renwich et al., 2013;Shen &amp; Benson, 2016;Su &amp; Swanson, 2019;Tian &amp; Robertson, 2019), the effects of employee green behavior in the hospitality industry require greater attention (Chen et al., 2015;Kim et al., 2019).With a focus on antecedents of green behavior (Ahmed et al., 2020;Dumont et al., 2017;Kim et al., 2019;Renwich et al., 2013;Shen &amp; Benson, 2016;Su &amp; Swanson, 2019;Tian &amp; Robertson, 2019), the effects of employee green behavior in the hospitality industry require greater attention (Chen et al., 2015;Kim et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>It is believed that this investigation has several potential contributions to the related research literature and practice. First, it analyzed the three-way interactive influence of CSR, GHRM, and responsible leadership on employee green behavior and performance. It recognized the complexity of organizational settings aimed at improving employee performance and can enrich the boundary condition research on CSR. Second, this work investigated the interactive influences of CSR, GHRM, and responsible leadership on employee task performance via green behavior through the lens of social cognition theory. This research tested the context-behavior-performance model in the hospitality industry.It is believed that this investigation has several potential contributions to the related research literature and practice.

        <p>The Three-way Interactive Effects of CSR, Green HRM, and Responsible Leadership Employee green behavior refers to resource recycling, conservation, and waste reduction behaviors in organizations (Ahmed et al., 2020;Chaudhary, 2020;Dumont et al., 2017).The Three-way Interactive Effects of CSR, Green HRM, and Responsible Leadership Employee green behavior refers to resource recycling, conservation, and waste reduction behaviors in organizations (Ahmed et al., 2020;Chaudhary, 2020;Dumont et al., 2017).</p>
        <p>Employee green behavior is potentially impacted by significant organizational contexts, including CSR (Su &amp; Swanson, 2019), GHRM (Dumont et al., 2017), and responsible leadership (Luu, 2019). CSR in hotels reflects the beliefs that organizational policies will achieve financial, social, and environmentally-sustainable development targets, including concerns about communities and the natural environment (Afsar et al., 2020;Calveras, 2015;Cheema et al., 2020).Employee green behavior is potentially impacted by significant organizational contexts, including CSR (Su &amp; Swanson, 2019), GHRM (Dumont et al., 2017), and responsible leadership (Luu, 2019).

        <p>CSR as a resource conservation policy and ethic creates a green context that fosters employee green behavior (Boan &amp; Dedeolu, 2020;Su &amp; Swanson, 2019). It is acknowledged that organizations that highly value corporate social and environmental responsibility make strong efforts to protect the environment, reduce resource waste and pollution, and care about customer and community benefits (Levy &amp; Park, 2011;Kim et al., 2017). This, in turn, encourages employees to conserve resources and protect the environment (Asfer et al., 2020;Chaudhary, 2020;Tian &amp; Robertson, 2019).CSR as a resource conservation policy and ethic creates a green context that fosters employee green behavior (Boan &amp; Dedeolu, 2020;Su &amp; Swanson, 2019).

        <p>GHRM refers to a bundle of HR practices that encourages and supports pro-environmental actions through positive effects on employee green behavior (Coan, 2015;Chaudhary, 2020;Dumont et al., 2017;Kramar, 2014;Kim et al., 2017, Kim et al., 2019;Renwich et al., 2013). GHRM valuing sustainable development usually represents formal organizational systems of environmental actions, including sustainability value-based recruitment, pro-environmental behavior training, and performance, and rewards (Ahmed et al., 2020;Chaudhary, 2020;Dumont et al., 2017;Kramar, 2014;Renwich et al., 2013).GHRM refers to a bundle of HR practices that encourages and supports pro-environmental actions through positive effects on employee green behavior (Coan, 2015;Chaudhary, 2020;Dumont et al., 2017;Kramar, 2014;Kim et al., 2017, Kim et al., 2019;Renwich et al., 2013).

        <p>GHRM promotes green behavior by enhancing employees' pro-environmental capabilities, knowledge, and skills (Guerci et al., 2016), strengthening employee motivation to engage in green behavior (Dumont et al., 2017), and providing opportunities for employee green behavior (Pham et al., 2019).GHRM promotes green behavior by enhancing employees' pro-environmental capabilities, knowledge, and skills (Guerci et al., 2016), strengthening employee motivation to engage in green behavior (Dumont et al., 2017), and providing opportunities for employee green behavior (Pham et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>Responsible leadership emphasizes that supervisors value companies' sustainable development goals, which include taking social responsibility for the increasing challenges of pollution, resource waste, and food safety (Afsar et al., 2016;Liao &amp; Zhang, 2020).Responsible leadership emphasizes that supervisors value companies' sustainable development goals, which include taking social responsibility for the increasing challenges of pollution, resource waste, and food safety (Afsar et al., 2016;Liao &amp; Zhang, 2020).</p>
        <p>Responsible leadership affects employee green behavior through informal personal relationships between supervisors and employees (Székely &amp; Knirsch, 2005;Waldman &amp; Balven, 2015). Responsible leaders have the supervisory power to encourage and support employees to engage in pro-environmental activities, including recycling and reducing pollution (Afsar et al., 2016;Robertson &amp; Barling, 2013). In addition, responsible leaders value organizational sustainability, indicating they are not only concerned about financial performance but also consider the sustainability of the environment and help to deliver on these values (Doh &amp; Quigley, 2014;Miska et al., 2014;Wang et al., 2015). They set an example to be followed by employees in the workplace (Kim et al., 2017;Xing &amp; Starik,2017;Waldman &amp; Balven, 2015). Furthermore, it is critical to consider the interactive effects among CSR, GHRM, and responsible leadership on employee behavior. CSR is the driver of organizational policies that demonstrate the value attached to social and environmental responsibility. It articulates the norms for protecting the environment, reducing resource waste and pollution, and caring about customer and community benefits (Su &amp; Swanson, 2019). GHRM and responsible leadership are the practices that support corporate social and environmental responsibility policies, and encourage the appropriate staff behaviors (Dumont et al., 2017;Waldman &amp; Balven, 2015). The interaction of CSR, GHRM, and responsible leadership potentially may further the effective attainment of corporate policies. Many previous studies focus on just a single factor; however, this research investigated the three-way interactive effects to expand upon these single antecedent models (Duffy et al.2006;Haar &amp; Roche, 2013).Responsible leadership affects employee green behavior through informal personal relationships between supervisors and employees (Székely &amp; Knirsch, 2005;Waldman &amp; Balven, 2015).

        <p>First, the effects of CSR may be augmented by GHRM practices in organizations (Aguinis &amp; Glavas, 2019;Farrington et al., 2017). Organizations emphasizing sustainability need their employees to be engaged in pro-environmental behaviors (Su &amp; Swanson, 2019).First, the effects of CSR may be augmented by GHRM practices in organizations (Aguinis &amp; Glavas, 2019;Farrington et al., 2017). Organizations emphasizing sustainability need their employees to be engaged in pro-environmental behaviors (Su &amp; Swanson, 2019).</p>
        <p>This not only necessitates formal policies and procedures but also requires cooperation and coordination between staff and employers. In this respect, GHRM can be the foundation that connects the two parties (Jiang et al., 2012). In addition, GHRM is comprised of critical employee management practices (recruiting, training, performance appraisal, and compensation) that may enhance the effects of CSR on this behavior (Norton et al., 2015;Lombardi et al., 2020). Moreover, without the support from GHRM, there might be negative effects of CSR on employee green behavior. CSR emphasizes advocacy and values that enhance employee identity with engaging in green behavior; however, CSR may introduce more workload, stress, and emotional exhaustion and have a negative influence on employee green behavior (Aguinis &amp; Glavas, 2019).This not only necessitates formal policies and procedures but also requires cooperation and coordination between staff and employers.

        <p>Responsible leadership may augment the interactive effects of CSR and GHRM on employee green behavior. Responsible leadership impacts employee behavior through informal leader-member relationships, and constitutes another organizational action that impacts workplaces (De Roeck &amp; Farooq, 2018;Leroy et al., 2018). Also, responsible leadership can make a difference in employee motivation and green behavior through informal personal relationships (Inceoglu et al., 2018;Kara et al., 2013;Luo et al., 2014;Robertson &amp; Carleton, 2018).Responsible leadership may augment the interactive effects of CSR and GHRM on employee green behavior.

        <p>Responsible leadership may strengthen the moderating effect of GHRM. GHRM highlights the management systems and processes that motivate employee green behavior (Dumont et al., 2017). However, GHRM may be insufficient in promoting employee green behavior. Responsible leadership may increase the beneficial effects of GHRM through individual employee impacts, including leaders providing resources and support (Afsar et al., 2016), and can play a key role in planning and executing CSR policies in organizations (Javed et al., 2020). If leadership is indifferent, it signals that supervisors do not value environmental protection and do not support employee green behavior through personal example, and this can cause diminished employee green behavior (Graves &amp; Sarkis, 2018).Responsible leadership may strengthen the moderating effect of GHRM.

        <p>Green behavior is characterized as responsible or pro-environmental actions that demonstrate a valuing of environmental sustainability, including reducing resource waste and the recycling of resources. Employee performance is defined as the quantity and quality of task accomplishment. According to the context-behavior-performance framework, employee green behavior reflects the knowledge, skills, and capabilities in the workplace (Chan et al., 2014), and employee green behavior leads to positive outcomes (Norton et al., 2015;Kim et al., 2019). Green behaviors improve employee performance for two reasons: first, they enhance and add to employee knowledge, skills, and values. Green behavior means that employees care about the sustainability of the organization and absorb pro-environmental knowledge and values at work which facilitates their efficiency and effectiveness in task accomplishment (Shen et al., 2016). Second, new skills are learned, and knowledge acquired in the service environment, with employees reducing waste and recycling resources, which reduces costs while also attaining environmental goals (Kim et al., 2019).

        <p>CSR articulates policies associated with sustainable development and exhibits care for the interests of employees, customers, communities, and governments, and it indirectly impacts employee performance (Tian &amp; Robertson, 2019). Social identity could potentially be a means for explaining the effects of CSR on individuals (Cheema et al., 2020;Tian &amp; Robertson, 2019). However, social identity has tended to focus on perceptions of individual images and identities, and a significant link between individual behavior and performance has been neglected (Fu, Ye, &amp; Law, 2014;Kim, et al., 2019).CSR articulates policies associated with sustainable development and exhibits care for the interests of employees, customers, communities, and governments, and it indirectly impacts employee performance (Tian &amp; Robertson, 2019).

        <p>According to social cognition theory, the context can be an important antecedent of individual behavior and lead to consequent performance (Bandura, 1991). Based on the context-behavior-performance framework, the foregoing discussion rests on an underlying assumption that organizational contexts (CSR, GHRM, and responsible leadership) affect individual task performance through green behavior. CSR, GHRM, and responsible leadership may directly improve employee green behaviors in organizations (Aguinis &amp; Glavas, 2019;Leroy et al., 2018). CSR is organizational policy and GHRM is formal HRM practice, while responsible leaders demonstrate concern and actions to protect the environment. Organizations and leaders set examples and provide role models to motivate employee green behavior (Kim et al., 2019).According to social cognition theory, the context can be an important antecedent of individual behavior and lead to consequent performance (Bandura, 1991).

        <p>These organizational contexts are believed to significantly influence green behavior and, in turn, enhance employee task performance. CSR provides employees with organizational norms and may encourage individuals to commit to their employers, positively influencing performance (Raub &amp; Blunschi, 2014;Shen et al., 2016). Moreover, GHRM augments work knowledge, skills, motivations, and opportunities, thereby also improving performance (Kim et al., 2019). Responsible leadership provides a proenvironmental model of care and support for green behavior and performance (Afsar et al. 2016). In addition, the effects of CSR are strengthened by GHRM and responsible leadership leading to improved employee performance via green behavior. Green behaviors in hotels conserve natural resources and energy, reduce non-durable product usage, and increase effectiveness and efficiency (Chen &amp; Lin, 2015;Chen et al., 2015;Kim et al., 2019). Therefore, the hypothesis was that green behavior plays a mediating role between the antecedents and employee task performance, as follows:These organizational contexts are believed to significantly influence green behavior and, in turn, enhance employee task performance.

        <p>A survey was conducted, and linear regression analysis was applied thereafter to examine the proposed theoretical model. The questionnaires were sent to 300 Millennial employees in five-star certified hotels in Hangzhou, Shanghai, Wuhan, Changsha, Shenzhen, and Chengdu from January to March, 2018. WeChat, email, and QQ were used for questionnaire distribution. Snowball (Sun et al., 2007) and convenience sampling (Ahmed et al., 2020) were applied in this research. Some 280 responses were received and there were 261 valid questionnaires after excluding 19 due to missing key variables or obvious tendencies for repetitive answers. Millennial employees of five-star hotels in China were selected for three reasons. First, the hospitality industry is quickly developing and making a positive contribution to better lives and economic transformation. Millennial employees (born after the 1980s) are the mainstream in hotels nowadays, and most of them are educated to protect the environment in response to sustainable development policies. Second, the attention attached to CSR in the hospitality industry is increasing (Boan &amp; Dedeolu, 2020), especially because resource waste and pollution are becoming increasingly serious issues in China. It is essential that green practices are implemented in hotels, and that green behaviors are encouraged. Third, as industry leaders five-star hotels typically assume the responsibility to be pioneers and role models for sustainable development policies and practices, including groups such as Banyan Tree, Six Senses, and Hilton.A survey was conducted, and linear regression analysis was applied thereafter to examine the proposed theoretical model.

        <p>Step 1 examined the effects of GHRM, responsible leadership, and CSR on employee green behavior. The results showed that GHRM was positively related to green behavior (M2:  = 0.271, p &lt; 0.001) (Table 3). Responsible leadership and CSR were also positively related to green behavior (M2:  = 0.232, p &lt; 0.001;  = 0.391, p &lt; 0.001). The results indicated that GHRM, responsible leadership, and CSR had positive effects on green behavior and that the effect of CSR on green behavior was strengthened by GHRM and responsible leadership. The results confirmed that the three-way interactive effect among CSR, GHRM, responsible leadership was positively associated with green behavior (M4:  = 0.107, p &lt; 0.05) and H1 was supported. The three-way interactive effect on green behavior is shown in Figure 2.Step 1 examined the effects of GHRM, responsible leadership, and CSR on employee green behavior.

        <p>This research explored the effects of important organizational contexts (CSR, GHRM, and responsible leadership) on green behaviors and consequently task performance based on social cognition theory. The context-behavior-performance framework was tested. CSR, GHRM, and responsible leadership had combined and synergistic effects on green behavior and task performance. CSR does not work in a vacuum, and the effects of CSR policies need the support of management practices, including GRHM and responsible leadership.This research explored the effects of important organizational contexts (CSR, GHRM, and responsible leadership) on green behaviors and consequently task performance based on social cognition theory.

        <p>GHRM is essential in pro-environment organizational context building. In addition, the results showed that the interactive effects of CSR and responsible leadership have negative effects on employee performance. This result is different from De Roeck &amp; Farooq (2018), who found a positive interactive effect of CSR and leadership. The possible reason is that CSR and responsible leadership may bring additional workload, stress, and conflict to employees without GRHM support. This negative effect of CSR needs more attention in future research (Aguinis &amp; Glavas, 2019). Therefore, GHRM plays an essential role in supporting and implementing CSR policies in hotels, and this is consistent with the perspectives of Luu (2018) and Kim et al (2019).GHRM is essential in pro-environment organizational context building.

        <p>First, this research explored the boundary conditions of CSR in organizations. The interactive effect of CSR, GHRM, and responsible leadership was tested, and this analysis explored the combined impact of important organizational factors (CSR, GHRM, and responsible leadership) in workplaces. The effects of CSR on employee green behavior and performance were impacted by GHRM and responsible leadership. The findings provide a comprehensive understanding of how complex organizational contexts promote employee green behavior and task performance. This supports previous studies revealing the positive effects of CSR (Ahmed et al., 2020;Su &amp; Swanson, 2019;Tian &amp; Robertson, 2019), GHRM the impacts of CSR on employee green behavior and task performance, as well as enriching CSR research at a micro level (Aguinis &amp; Glavas, 2019;Ahmed et al., 2020;Boan &amp; Dedeolu, 2020;Cheema et al., 2020). CSR and individual outcomes are emphasized in this research as green behavior is important in hospitality and should be the subject of greater research in the future.

        <p>It is highly desirable for managers to promote employee green behaviors. Proenvironmental actions are important for organizational development and society. Green management could be characterized as being at an early stage, particularly in China where many properties and companies have neglected these concerns. Several world-renowned hotel groups have exemplary pro-environmental practices and should be a beacon for others highlighting what is needed. Six Senses and Banyan Tree, for instance, emphasize CSR and employee green behavior and thereby have improved their competitive advantages. Many hotels in China need to follow these examples and do much more to conserve resources and protect the environment, especially because of their dependency on natural resources and energy. Being so labor-intensive, enhancing employee green behavior could be a major resource-and cost-saving strategy. Also, this investigation suggests that green behavior has positive impacts on workplace task performance.It is highly desirable for managers to promote employee green behaviors.

        <p>CSR can be used as an informal HRM strategy in organizations, as it has positive impacts on green behavior and task performance. CSR delivers messages that organizations care about their employees, society, and sustainable development. It elevates the norms and values that can transform organizations and their people (Cheema et al., 2020). When successfully implemented, CSR encourages staff to absorb the norms and values and to mirror their organizations in pro-environmental behavior. Therefore, it is essential for organizations to fully embrace their social responsibilities and to encourage higher levels of green behavior.CSR can be used as an informal HRM strategy in organizations, as it has positive impacts on green behavior and task performance.
