        <p>Microplastics (MPs) represent a current public health concern since toxicity has not yet fully investigated. They were found in several foods, but to the best of our knowledge, at this time no data was reported for the edible vegetables and fruits. We focused on diet exposure aiming to evaluate the number and the size (&lt; 10 μm) of MPs in the most commonly consumed vegetables and fruits, in relation to their recommended daily intake too. MPs extraction and analysis were carried out using an innovative Italian methodology and SEM-EDX, respectively. Finally, we calculated the Estimated Daily Intakes (EDIs) for adults and children for each type of vegetal and fruit.Microplastics (MPs) represent a current public health concern since toxicity has not yet fully investigated.

        <p>The higher median (IQR) level of MPs in fruit and vegetable samples was 223,000 (52,600-307,750) and 97,800 (72,500), respectively. In particular, apples were the most contaminated fruit samples, while carrot was the most contaminated vegetable. Conversely, the lower median (IQR) level was observed in lettuce samples 52,050 (26,425). Both vegetable and fruit samples MPs levels were characterized by wide variability. The smallest size of MPs was found in the carrot samples (1.51 μm), while the biggest ones were found in the lettuce (2.52 μm). Both vegetable and fruit samples had size of the MPs characterized by low variability. We found the highest median level of MPs in samples purchased from the "fruiter 3" (124,900 p/g) and the lowest in those purchased in "supermarket" (87,600 p/g). The median size of the MPs had overlapping dimensions in all the purchase sites, with the exception of the samples purchased at the "shop at km zero 2″ which had slightly smaller size (1.81 μm).The higher median (IQR) level of MPs in fruit and vegetable samples was 223,000 (52,600-307,750) and 97,800 (72,500), respectively.

        <p>Agricultural systems are the final recipients of a number of several pollutants (Razzaghi et al., 2018) and nanomaterials, including microplastics (MPs), with effects relatively unknown. The general lack of understanding regarding nanomaterial fate and effects in agricultural systems is troublesome given the potential for food chain contamination and for an uncharacterized pathway of human exposure. MPs nanotechnology is a rapidly growing area of nanotechnology research. MPs are capable to penetrate the seed, root, culm, leaves and fruits plant cell based on their size and type (Dietz and Hertz, 2011) and this is the only study on plants; no study is available on the edible plants. The size of MPs alone is of great significance in food and health risk assessment. The effects of penetration of microplastics into the https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.109677 Received 1 April 2020; Received in revised form 2 May 2020; Accepted 11 May 2020 plant system can be speculated to modify the growth and also other characteristics such as taste. However, no data are available until today on this topic. The nanobiotechnology may be helpful for the advancement of plant science assessment but, for a more correct human's risk assessment too.Agricultural systems are the final recipients of a number of several pollutants (Razzaghi et al., 2018) and nanomaterials, including microplastics (MPs), with effects relatively unknown.

        <p>The WHO indicates that Mediterranean diet is the best prevention tool for a healthy life (Renzella et al., 2018 Romagnolo andSelmin, 2017); against noncommunicable diseases and at least 400 g (i.e. five portions) of fruit and vegetables per day are indicated for a good health status maintaining, excluding potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava and other starchy roots. So, it is extremely important to monitor the food quality and, in consideration of the high widespread of MPs in the environment and due to the lack of specific national and international policies and/or food standard limits for the plastic contamination control, the assessment of nano and micro plastics is particularly relevant. MPs are categorized into primary and secondary types. Primary MPs are produced and these are characterized by a size &lt; 5 mm for several industrial applications, while secondary MPs result from the breakdown of larger plastic items. Microbeads in personal care products or cosmetics are an example of primary MPs (Kang et al., 2019;Duis and Coors, 2016;GESAMP, 2016).The WHO indicates that Mediterranean diet is the best prevention tool for a healthy life (Renzella et al., 2018 Romagnolo andSelmin, 2017); against noncommunicable diseases and at least 400 g (i.e. five portions) of fruit and vegetables per day are indicated for a good health status maintaining, excluding potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava and other starchy roots.

        <p>The evaluation the food/fruit and vegetables quality in term of MPs content besides the classical monitored pollutants can be a better approach in diet risk assessment and permits the assessment of the real EDI of total MPs ingested through the agrifood products. Currently, no information is available on this topic due to the absence of data about the nano-and microplastics presence in edible vegetables tissues. To fill this gap, we applied our method to evaluate the NPs and MPs &lt; 10 μm presence and their concentration in common edible fruit and vegetables.The evaluation the food/fruit and vegetables quality in term of MPs content besides the classical monitored pollutants can be a better approach in diet risk assessment and permits the assessment of the real EDI of total MPs ingested through the agrifood products.

        <p>The smallest MPs' size was found in the carrot samples (1.51 μm), while the biggest ones were found in the lettuce (2.52 μm) (Table 1). Both vegetable and fruit samples had size of the MPs characterized by low variability (Fig. 3). The adults' (4.62 E+05) and children's (1.41 E +06) EDIs had the highest increasing following the ingestion of apples and the lowest following carrots ingestion (adults: 2.96 E+04; children: 1.15 E+05) (Table 1).The smallest MPs' size was found in the carrot samples (1.51 μm), while the biggest ones were found in the lettuce (2.52 μm) (Table 1).

        <p>We found the highest median level of MPs in samples purchased from the "fruiter 3" (124,900 p/g) and the lowest in those purchased in "supermarket" (87,600 p/g) (Table 2).We found the highest median level of MPs in samples purchased from the "fruiter 3" (124,900 p/g) and the lowest in those purchased in "supermarket" (87,600 p/g) (Table 2).</p>
        <p>The median size of the MPs had overlapping dimensions in all the purchase sites, with the exception of the samples purchased at the "shop at km zero 2″ which had slightly smaller size (1.81 μm) (Fig. 4).

        <p>The highest adults' (4.62 E+05) and children's (1.41 E+06) EDIs are due to the ingestion of apples, instead the lowest are due to the ingestion of carrots (adults: 2.96 E+04; children: 1.15 E+05). The EDIs of children are highest for all studied edible vegetable and fruits than adults due to the lowest BW of children, in fact, children ingest smaller quantities of all the studied vegetables and fruits but, the exposures are greater than adults when considered in relation of BW.The highest adults' (4.62 E+05) and children's (1.41 E+06) EDIs are due to the ingestion of apples, instead the lowest are due to the ingestion of carrots (adults: 2.96 E+04; children: 1.15 E+05).

        <p>For first time we detected MPs in edible fruit and vegetables. Results open a new scenario both in environmental and medical sciences. No experimental data are available about uptake and translocation of microplastics in vegetal tissues.For first time we detected MPs in edible fruit and vegetables.

        <p>We can suppose that microplastics may be absorbed to the similarity of carbon nanomaterials and translocated in vegetal tissues similarly to the modality of uptake of the more studied carbon-nanomaterials (Herremans et al., 2015 Dietz andHerth, 2011). For this type of nanoparticles the uptake by plant system is inversely proportional to its size and can affect the plant growth and fruits (Husen andSiddiqi, 2014 Bosker et al., 2019). So, the particles with a large size are forbidden to enter the plant cell and therefore, get adsorbed on the surface. Carbon nanomaterials may be absorbed through roots of the plants but, in seeds it may penetrate when have appropriate size and translocated to the shoot also by endocytosis, in the aerial parts through capillary action to places where the passage adequate of their size (Husen and Siddiqi, 2014) therefore, the nanomaterial accumulated in plant tissues may be transferred to the consumer through diet.We can suppose that microplastics may be absorbed to the similarity of carbon nanomaterials and translocated in vegetal tissues similarly to the modality of uptake of the more studied carbon-nanomaterials (Herremans et al., 2015 Dietz andHerth, 2011).

        <p>We suppose that the same mechanism of uptake and translocation may be possible for micro and nanoplastics being these also them self the carbon based particles Bosker et al. (2019). Show that exposure to plastics caused significant impacts on germination and root growth of the terrestrial vascular Lepidium sativum, and Hasen et al. (2014) highlighted that the accumulation of Carbon nanomaterial of appropriate size in the plant cells hampers the absorption/uptake of essential nutrients delaying the growth and flowering. Herremans et al. (2015) carried out a study on M. domestica using the X-ray micro-tomography at various spatial resolutions to investigate the growth of void network and vascular system transport structures in 3D during fruit development of "Jona gold" apple. The developing fruit showed a more extensive vascular network compared to their rather small volume. Herremans et al. report that also the vascular bundles increase, both in terms of average diameter as well as length, wise with the growth progression (Herremans et al., 2015).We suppose that the same mechanism of uptake and translocation may be possible for micro and nanoplastics being these also them self the carbon based particles Bosker et al.

        <p>About that, Xylem and Phloem are the two types of transport tissue in vascular plants (Pace, 2019). The basic function of Xylem is to transport water from roots to stems and leaves, but it also transports NPs as reported by Dietz and Herth (2011) review study. The Xylem cells are long tracheary elements that transport water and nutrients with a mean diameter ranging by 200-700 μm for the Angiosperms group (Pace, 2019), in which all our species studied are included.About that, Xylem and Phloem are the two types of transport tissue in vascular plants (Pace, 2019).

        <p>Phloem is the vascular tissue in charge of transport and distribution of the organic nutrients, is a pathway for the distribution of signaling molecules and, finally, has a structural function in the plant body. The diameter (μm) of sieve pores in Phloem ranging by 4.0-100 μm in Angiosperm (Mullendore et al., 2010), generally is composed of three cell types: sieve elements, parenchyma, and sclerenchyma (Pace, 2019). Also, the void network is important pathway for the transport of gases, water and solutes in fruit (Herremans et al., 2015).Phloem is the vascular tissue in charge of transport and distribution of the organic nutrients, is a pathway for the distribution of signaling molecules and, finally, has a structural function in the plant body.

        <p>NPs are adsorbed to plant surfaces and taken up through natural nano or micrometer cale plant openings. Several pathways exist or are predicted for NP association and uptake in plants (Dietz andHert, 2011 Vithanage et al., 2017). The vascular system is more complicated and largest compared to vegetables. So, we assume that the large quantity of microplastics detected in both fruits is justified for their vascular network complexity due to the necessity to nourish and protect the seeds.NPs are adsorbed to plant surfaces and taken up through natural nano or micrometer cale plant openings.

        <p>Cellular uptake of various types of NPs has been extensively studied, revealing capability of active endocytosis involved in their internalization in vegetal tissue. This capability is verified also for NPs &gt; 150 nm as reported by several authors in animal in vitro study (Wang et al., 2017Zhang et al., 2009). By endocytosis, and/or using also carrier proteins or ion channels, the carbon nanoparticles (CNTs) can enter into the cytoplasm of plant cells. It was advanced hypothesis that translocation of MultiWalled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNT) (ranging on size between 3500 and 3900 nm) occurs together to the uptake of water and nutrients at roots level transporting these at shoots. In fact Martı'nez Ballesta et al. (2016), showed that MWCNT entered the cells in adult broccoli plants with high accumulation under saline conditions (Martì nez-Bellesta et al., 2016). Further, it was demonstrated also that MWCNT could be downward transported from leaves to roots using the network of phloem specifically when MWCNT enter into plants through leaves. About that, Chen et al. has provided scientific evidence about MWCNTs capability to be absorbed by roots of mature mustard plants and then, translocated to other parts of the same roots and carried up to the leaves too (Chen et al., 2015). However, due to the relatively larger size of MWCNT than fullerene, the internalization of CNTs into the cells is easier (Vithanage et al., 2017;Lin et al., 2009;De La Torre-Roche et al., 2013Gogos et al., 2016). The same mechanisms can be assumed for microplastics uptake and translocation.Cellular uptake of various types of NPs has been extensively studied, revealing capability of active endocytosis involved in their internalization in vegetal tissue.

        <p>The EDIs to microplastics is lower from the intake of agrifood products compared to that due to the intake of mineral water in plastic bottles against 1.5 E+06 and 3.4 E+06 from mineral water, respectively in adults and children (Zuccarello et al., 2019a). Therefore, although the abundant presence of MPs in the investigated vegetables was of considerable concern, exposure to MPs through the ingestion of these foods was less than PET bottled mineral water consume.The EDIs to microplastics is lower from the intake of agrifood products compared to that due to the intake of mineral water in plastic bottles against 1.5 E+06 and 3.4 E+06 from mineral water, respectively in adults and children (Zuccarello et al., 2019a).

        <p>The present work provided for first time clues about the presence of MPs in vegetables and fruits (carrots, lettuces, broccoli, potato apples and pears). Moreover, our results indicated that plastic participles are more concentrated in fruits than in vegetables edible parts and that plastic sizes are different in the assessed plants being very small in carrots tissues.The present work provided for first time clues about the presence of MPs in vegetables and fruits (carrots, lettuces, broccoli, potato apples and pears).

        <p>We can hypothesize that the fruits contain more MPs not only because of the very high vascularization of the fruit pulp but also due to the greater size and complexity of the root system and age of the tree (several years) compared to the vegetables (60-75 days for the carrot). Also, the carrot has small, microscopic hairs on the outside of the epidermis of central root and these serve to increase the surface area of the root but survive for only a few days. The moisture content of carrot and apple are similar, from 86 to 89% (Sharma et al., 2012) for carrot and 84-86% for apple (Canet, 1988).We can hypothesize that the fruits contain more MPs not only because of the very high vascularization of the fruit pulp but also due to the greater size and complexity of the root system and age of the tree (several years) compared to the vegetables (60-75 days for the carrot).

        <p>Finally, our data highlighted for the first time the worrying Estimated Daily Intakes either for adults or for children in term of plastic particles. At present, it is premature to draw conclusions about the potential effects of naturally occurring levels of microplastics on agrifood products. Future researches should specifically focus on understanding nanotoxicity in plants but also in human through the diet. An important point is to assess MPs persistence in plants depending on size and chemistry of MPs, similar to studies in animal cell systems.Finally, our data highlighted for the first time the worrying Estimated Daily Intakes either for adults or for children in term of plastic particles.
