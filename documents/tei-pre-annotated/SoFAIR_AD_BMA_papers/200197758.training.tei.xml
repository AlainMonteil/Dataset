        <p>Policymakers and economists have indicated that entrepreneurship plays an important role in promoting economic growth and innovation (van Praag and Versloot 2007;Fayolle and Gailly 2008). Related research findings show that a higher level of entrepreneurship might be achieved through education (Jack and Anderson 1998;EC 2006). Entrepreneurship education (EE) programs have accordingly experienced a rapid and global development within higher education over recent decades (Neck and Greene 2011;Fayolle 2013).Policymakers and economists have indicated that entrepreneurship plays an important role in promoting economic growth and innovation (van Praag and Versloot 2007;Fayolle and Gailly 2008).

        <p>Research into the impact of EE has examined entrepreneurial knowledge, skills and behaviour, and entrepreneurial intent (EI). Nabi et al. (2017) called for novel impact indicators of EE beyond EI after a review of 159 articles on EE impact found that 51 percent focused on EI. This research explores a new EE impact indicator by highlighting entrepreneurial mindset (EM), which was considered as a deeper cognitive phenomena reflecting malleable cognitive structures (Krueger 2015). This structure reflects the way of thinking that makes entrepreneurs so unique in the engagement of entrepreneurial activities.Research into the impact of EE has examined entrepreneurial knowledge, skills and behaviour, and entrepreneurial intent (EI).

        <p>EM enables individuals to think and act entrepreneurially because it underpins successful future strategies (Covin and Slevin 2002). In nature, the foundation of EM lies in cognitive adaptability (Haynie et al. 2010), which is vital to achieve desirable outcomes following entrepreneurial action (Krauss, Frese and Friedrich 2005).EM enables individuals to think and act entrepreneurially because it underpins successful future strategies (Covin and Slevin 2002).

        <p>Existing studies of EE impact have mainly addressed EI (Nabi et al. 2017) and few studies have examined the EE-EM link. The lack of research into EM has been recently highlighted (Nabi et al. 2017;Yatu et al. 2018). EM is closely related to opportunity recognition, which lies at the core of entrepreneurship and might determine entrepreneurial success. Bridging the connection between EE and EM would thus contribute to a deeper understanding on the scope and extent of EE impact. One of the Cui, J., Sun, J. &amp; Bell, R.

        <p>Moreover, it is not clear how EM evolves throughout education. Emotional factors are probably crucial for the formation of EM because affective events play a vital role in entrepreneurial learning (Cope 2003) and because different educational designs can trigger affective events, which successively promote entrepreneurial competences (Lackéus 2014). However, emotional constructs are rare in EE research (Kyrö 2008). A possible emotional mediator between EE and EM is entrepreneurial inspiration (Souitaris, Zerbinati, and AI-Laham 2007), a gap for EE researchers seeking the emotional drivers of EM.Moreover, it is not clear how EM evolves throughout education.

        <p>In addition, the effectiveness of EE in higher education, while largely positive, has shown some mixed results (Pittaway and Cope 2007;Oosterbeek, van Praag, and Ijsselstein 2010;Martin, McNally, and Kay 2013;Bae et al. 2014). These contradictory findings may be due to pedagogy, as studies have shown that educational attributes like extracurricular activity, optional courses, and practice-based activity can influence students' EI (Piperopoulos and Dimov 2015;Karimi et al. 2016;Arranz et al. 2017).In addition, the effectiveness of EE in higher education, while largely positive, has shown some mixed results (Pittaway and Cope 2007;Oosterbeek, van Praag, and Ijsselstein 2010;Martin, McNally, and Kay 2013;Bae et al. 2014).

        <p>The impact of EE could also differ because of local or national context (Ahmad et al. 2018;Chen and Agrawal 2018). Only 5 percent of empirical samples used in EE impact studies are from fast-growing emerging economies such as Brazil, Russia, India and China (Nabi et al. 2017). In China, management education appeared in a few universities in the 1980s, business schools or management schools were established in the early 1990s, and MBA programmes were introduced in the mid-1990s, which planted the seeds for the flourishing of entrepreneurship education later (Li, Zhang, and Matlay 2003). However, EE was a relatively new concept and practice until 2001 when the Ministry of Education introduced a pilot initiative of EE at the undergraduate level in nine universities (Li, Zhang, and Matlay 2003). After that, EE has developed rapidly but it is optional and isolated from the curriculum framework in higher education. In 2015, the central government implemented a national policy of 'enterprising and entrepreneurship education' which has led to widespread EE programs and courses in Cui, J., Sun, J. &amp; Bell, R. (2019) The Impact of Entrepreneurship Education on the Entrepreneurial Mindset of College Students in China: The mediating role of inspiration and the role of educational attributes, International Journal of Management Education. doi: 10.1016/j.ijme.2019.04.001 higher education sectors. This policy adopted a broader perspective on entrepreneurship education calling for entrepreneurial modules in a coherent framework in general education in universities and colleges. It has also encouraged the development and delivery of education through the use of active student centred educational approaches (Tan 2016;2017). However, compared to business education curricula, the entrepreneurship education discipline is still relatively young and under researched in China. It has not yet developed a universally-recognised teaching mode with best practices (Lin and Xu 2017). Furthermore, stakeholders of EE may be unaware of how EE programs affect students' learning outcomes.

        <p>This study aims to firstly investigate the impact of EE on the cultivation of EM of Chinese students in higher education and secondly to explore the role of inspiration and educational attributes, respectively, in the relationship between EE and EM. In particular, this research focuses on two aspects of EE: curriculum attendance and extracurricular activity, and three educational attributes: type of learning experience, type of course, and type of extracurricular activity. This research has adopted four cognitive attributes of entrepreneurs as components of an entrepreneurial mindset: risk propensity, ambiguity tolerance, dispositional optimism, and alertness to opportunity because they are closely linked to entrepreneurial activity and process (Kaish and Gilad 1991;Shane and Venkataraman 2000;Baron 2006).This study aims to firstly investigate the impact of EE on the cultivation of EM of Chinese students in higher education and secondly to explore the role of inspiration and educational attributes, respectively, in the relationship between EE and EM.

        <p>The study highlights EM as a new type of impact and thus expands the EE impact framework by confirming the direct effect of EE on EM. Further academic value is added by investigating the mediating roles of inspiration and the roles of education attributes, which will provide new insights into the formative factors of EM and deepen the understanding of whether and how EE affects EM. The research should consequently provide new insights for EE researchers, educators, and policy-makers. This paper is structured as follows. First, theoretical grounding is provided followed by hypotheses and the research framework. Secondly, the methodology is described including samples and measures. Thirdly, the results are presented followed by a discussion section including theoretical and practical implications. Finally, the conclusion provides the key findings, contributions, limitations and suggestions for future research.The study highlights EM as a new type of impact and thus expands the EE impact framework by confirming the direct effect of EE on EM.

        <p>There is still no consistent and reasonable model of matching which type of entrepreneurship education yields which outcomes since paradigms of entrepreneurship education are diversified ranging from a causal and linear understanding of planning, through an approach which focuses on students' mindsets, to a process-related entrepreneurial and methodical approach (Rasmussen and Nybye 2013). Entrepreneurial mindset is viewed as a critical element in the learning journey towards entrepreneurial effectiveness of entrepreneurial education (QAA 2018). The existing EE impact research is mainly based on the theory of entrepreneurial intentions, frequently drawing on Ajzen's (1991) Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and Shapero and Sokol's (1982) Entrepreneurial Event Model (EEM) based on motivational theories.There is still no consistent and reasonable model of matching which type of entrepreneurship education yields which outcomes since paradigms of entrepreneurship education are diversified ranging from a causal and linear understanding of planning, through an approach which focuses on students' mindsets, to a process-related entrepreneurial and methodical approach (Rasmussen and Nybye 2013).

        <p>The former consists of three components that predict the formation of intention which in turn predicts behaviour, namely the attitude toward the behaviour, subjective norms and the degree of perceived behavioural control (self-efficacy). The latter indicates that EI stems from the perception of feasibility and desirability, and this path is affected by the cultural and social context. Although the two frameworks have been over-used, they provide an applicable model for us to understand and predict entrepreneurial intentions.The former consists of three components that predict the formation of intention which in turn predicts behaviour, namely the attitude toward the behaviour, subjective norms and the degree of perceived behavioural control (self-efficacy).

        <p>However, in order to explain the relationship between entrepreneurship education and students' entrepreneurial mindset instead of intention, we follow Bandura's (2001) Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) which reveals interactions between personal (cognitive) variables, environmental factors, and behaviours in human functioning. Béchard and Grégoire (2005) argue that SCT may provide a coherent framework to understand holistically entrepreneurship education from the view of cognitive psychology. Winkler (2014) applied this theory into the context of entrepreneurship education and developed a dynamic framework for EE impact research, which contributes to investigation of how environmental factors of EE learning affect student cognition and subsequent entrepreneurial behaviour. Winkler (2014) further identified environmental factors such as academic courses, curricula and non-academic learning experiences Cui, J., Sun, J. &amp; Bell, R. (2019) The Impact of Entrepreneurship Education on the Entrepreneurial Mindset of College Students in China: The mediating role of inspiration and the role of educational attributes, International Journal of Management Education. doi: 10.1016Education. doi: 10. /j.ijme.2019.04.001 .04.001 (activities for example), and cognitive factors such as self-efficacy and intention. Given that entrepreneurial learning could result in mind-shift and emotional changing (Gibb 2002), and that entrepreneurial mindset is a metacognitive function (Haynie et al. 2010), EM is therefore a kind of cognitive personal variable influenced by environmental variables within EE here referring to curriculum and extra-curricular activities. Clearly, this study contributes to Winkler's (2014) framework by recognizing EM as a new type of cognitive variable. In this sense, SCT provides to some extent the theoretical grounding for our research leading us to investigate the relationship between EE and the changes of students' EM.

        <p>The notion of mindset originates from the cognitive psychology fields. Mindsets are not innate; they can be influenced and learned by an individual's prior knowledge and the interaction with current environment (Mathisen and Arnulf 2014). McGrath and MacMillan (2000, XV) firstly defined entrepreneurial mindset as 'the ability to rapidly sense, act, and mobilize, even under highly uncertain conditions'. Shepherd, Patzelt, and Haynie (2010, 62) explained EM as an 'ability and willingness of individuals to rapidly sense, act, and mobilize in response to a judgement decision under uncertainty about a possible opportunity for gain'. McMullen and Kier (2016, 664) stressed that EM is an 'ability to identify and exploit opportunities without regard to the resources currently under their control', which means that entrepreneurial activity has risks to some extent.The notion of mindset originates from the cognitive psychology fields.

        <p>Other definitions of entrepreneurial mindset existing in the literature vary but the common point of them is that entrepreneurial mindset is a way of thinking or an ability to capture entrepreneurial opportunities in an uncertain situation. As a kind of metacognition, entrepreneurial mindset can be improved through training and can be considered as a mind habit that requires learning to shape (Schmidt and Ford 2003).Other definitions of entrepreneurial mindset existing in the literature vary but the common point of them is that entrepreneurial mindset is a way of thinking or an ability to capture entrepreneurial opportunities in an uncertain situation.

        <p>Based on the combination understanding of those definitions of entrepreneurial mindset, we recognized four components of an entrepreneurial mindset: alertness to opportunity, risk propensity, ambiguity tolerance, and dispositional optimism. We also Cui, J., Sun, J. &amp; Bell, R.

        <p>Alertness to opportunity was conceived as an entrepreneurial cognition process with alert scanning and search, alert association and connections, and evaluation and judgment related to the information of opportunity (Tang, Kacmar, and Busenitz 2012).Alertness to opportunity was conceived as an entrepreneurial cognition process with alert scanning and search, alert association and connections, and evaluation and judgment related to the information of opportunity (Tang, Kacmar, and Busenitz 2012).</p>
        <p>This means that alertness to opportunity is the ability to possess keen insights into identifying entrepreneurial opportunities. The process of entrepreneurship starts from opportunity recognition, but prior to opportunity recognition, alertness to opportunity is a prominent factor (Krueger, Reilly, and Carsrud 2000). Researchers have agreed that the higher a person's level of alertness is, the more probable the opportunity can be recognized even without active engagement of observing or searching for them (George et al. 2016). In this sense, alertness to opportunity is a basic and crucial element of an entrepreneurial mindset. Many scholars agree that alertness involves a mindset based on several capacities and processes such as prior knowledge, skills of pattern recognition and information processing (Ardichvili 2003). We can argue that this knowledge and soft skills on which alertness is based could be learned and developed by education. Tang, Kacmar and Busenitz (2012) found that alert scanning and search for opportunity represent the cumulative learning and experience in the developmental cognition process. Therefore, entrepreneurial education is one of the determinants of alertness to opportunity.This means that alertness to opportunity is the ability to possess keen insights into identifying entrepreneurial opportunities.

        <p>Risk propensity is defined as a subject's current tendency or willingness towards taking or avoiding risks (Pablo 1997). Risk propensity plays a critical role in opportunity identification and the success of entrepreneurial action. Individuals with a greater risktaking propensity find it easier to perceive the overall opportunities around them (Foo 2011). Studies show that the different extent of risk propensity of entrepreneurs could result in different entrepreneurial decisions (Hadida and Paris 2014). We thus consider it as a pivotal element of an entrepreneurial mindset. In nature, risk propensity is not a stable and unchangeable trait, but can vary and be shaped in different scenarios (Wang, Xu, and Zhang et al. 2016). Ertuna and Gurel (2011) detected a significant positive interaction link between attending entrepreneurial education in university and Cui, J., Sun, J. &amp; Bell, R.

Neneh's (2012) study found that education could enhance factors like risk taking which shapes EM. Sánchez (2013) concluded that an educational program for science and engineering students had a positive impact on the entrepreneurial competencies of students including risk taking. Also, Bell's (2015) study indicated that the experiential learning approach in business higher education in the UK could develop students' entrepreneurial characteristics such as risk taking. These findings jointly support the assumption that EE could affect students' mindset of risk propensity.Risk propensity is defined as a subject's current tendency or willingness towards taking or avoiding risks (Pablo 1997).

        <p>Ambiguity tolerance is defined as the way individuals interpret, process, and respond to information about vague situations marked by a series of inconsistent, complex, unfamiliar or fragmented clues (Furnham and Ribchester 1995). Entrepreneurs need to have high level of ambiguity tolerance because entrepreneurial activities are by nature unpredictable. If entrepreneurs are highly tolerant with ambiguity, they view ambiguous scenarios as promising and challenging, instead of stressful and disappointing (Furnham and Ribchester 1995). For these reasons, we believe ambiguity tolerance is an important element of an entrepreneurial mindset. Lackéus' (2014) study found that action-based entrepreneurial education has an impact on the formation of ambiguity tolerance through certain emotional events. This study has identified the importance of ambiguity tolerance as an impact indicator of EE, and provides support for this study to explore the links between EE and ambiguity tolerance.Ambiguity tolerance is defined as the way individuals interpret, process, and respond to information about vague situations marked by a series of inconsistent, complex, unfamiliar or fragmented clues (Furnham and Ribchester 1995).

Lackéus' (2014) study found that action-based entrepreneurial education has an impact on the formation of ambiguity tolerance through certain emotional events. This study has identified the importance of ambiguity tolerance as an impact indicator of EE, and provides support for this study to explore the links between EE and ambiguity tolerance.</p>
        <p>Dispositional optimism is defined as 'the global generalized tendency to believe that one will experience good versus bad outcomes in life' (Crane, Blunden and Meyer 2012: 116). Optimism is not only linked to desirable results, but also connected to joy which affects the assessment of opportunity and the following behaviour in the entrepreneurial activities (Grichnik, Smeja, and Welpe 2010). In this sense, dispositional optimism, rather than pessimism, is extremely important for entrepreneurs to motivate themselves and to obtain goals continuously. The relationship of EE and dispositional optimism is under-covered in previous research. Studies show that self-efficacy can mediate the effects of entrepreneurial learning in courses on entrepreneurial intention (Zhao, Selbert and Hills 2005), but self-efficacy is highly correlated to optimism (Crane 2014). Crane and Meyer's (2007) study demonstrated that dispositional optimism can Cui, J., Sun, J. &amp; Bell, R.

This suggests that EE is relevant to EM and it can be assumed that it could be fostered and enhanced through targeted education.Dispositional optimism is defined as 'the global generalized tendency to believe that one will experience good versus bad outcomes in life' (Crane, Blunden and Meyer 2012: 116).

        <p>The above four components of an EM are internally connected. Specifically, alertness to opportunity plays a central role in opportunity recognition which pushes forward the process of entrepreneurship in an uncertain environment. This kind of uncertainty is typically demonstrated as risk and ambiguity (McGrath and MacMillan 2000). Individuals with a higher risk propensity find it easier to perceive entrepreneurial opportunity around them (Foo 2011). Moreover, the uncertainty of the entrepreneurial situation leads to unpredictable results and thus ambiguity tolerance is also necessary for an entrepreneur. In addition, as the process of entrepreneurship involves alertness to opportunity in a risky and ambiguous situation of uncertainty, entrepreneurs need to cope with impediments, setbacks, and even failures possibly occurring in the journey of entrepreneurship (Crane, Blunden and Meyer 2012). Therefore, dispositional optimism together with the other three components jointly contributes to an entrepreneurial mindset.The above four components of an EM are internally connected.

        <p>Affective development related to feelings, emotions, and moods is an important key to the learning process of entrepreneurship, which is often neglected in the entrepreneurship research (Gibb 2002). Emotions have been found to moderate the relationship between knowledge and cognitive skills (Loon and Bell 2018). As a construct with emotional components, entrepreneurial inspiration has been defined as 'a change of hearts and minds evoked by events or inputs from the program and directed towards considering becoming an entrepreneur' (Souitaris, Zerbinati, and AI-Laham 2007, 573). This definition encompasses a new desired target of motivation to be entrepreneurial and an educational stimulator from curriculum or co-curriculum. Souitaris, Zerbinati, and AI-Laham ( 2007) illustrated inspiration was one of the three types of benefits from an entrepreneurship program including both a course and complementary activities in university science and engineering majors.

        <p>As discussed earlier, varied results of EE impact studies could be partly explained by context-specific factors related to educational attributes. Curriculum and extracurricular activity are two basic sources of learning experiences in an entrepreneurship education program, but their effect is unequal. Peterman and Kennedy (2003) argue that formal curriculum does not stimulate entrepreneurial intention, on the contrary, it reduces tolerance for ambiguity. Shapero and Sokol (1982) also explain that formal education decreases curiosity and risk propensity. However, extracurricular activities like guest speakers, business plan competitions, and entrepreneurship incubator projects are incentives to the motivation of entrepreneurship (Souitaris, Zerbinati, and AI-Laham's 2007).

Hence, we expect to observe whether outside classroom activity is more influential than formal courses on the cultivation of students' mindset.

        <p>Students with a genuine interest in a subject are more likely to opt into studying an optional course, whilst the interest of students enrolling on compulsory courses may be harder to discern.

So, an optional course should exert more influence on students' learning outcomes including mindset. Therefore, it is suggested that: Hypothesis 8.

        <p>Entrepreneurship education takes many different forms including curricular courses and extracurricular activities and serves different purposes in undergraduate level. Johannisson (1991) It is acknowledged that all of the extra curricula activities had some theoretical grounding and were not purely practical or that the theoretical grounding was covered elsewhere, for example in corresponding classes. Although, it is hard to exactly pinpoint the balance the theoretical grounding provided and the practical nature of the activity and previous training. In EE research, Piperopoulos and Dimov (2015) found that there was a negative relationship between self-efficacy and entrepreneurial intentions in theory courses, whilst there was a positive relationship in practical courses. Also, Hynes, Costin and Birdthistle (2011) found that a practice-based learning module brings real business learning and meets the requirements of different internal and external stakeholders in entrepreneurship education. However, the role of theoretical and practice-based activity in EE impact research requires further exploration. So, the following hypothesis is proposed: In summary, a mediating model has been developed as the conceptual framework (Figure 1). This model bridges the gap between EE and EM and explores the mediating role of inspiration and the role of educational attributes in the EE-EM link.Entrepreneurship education takes many different forms including curricular courses and extracurricular activities and serves different purposes in undergraduate level.

        <p>Table 2 presents the reliability, validity, correlations and descriptive statistics for the variables in our model. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alpha (α) and composite reliability (CR). The α values for constructs are all more than 0.8 with the highest 0.946 indicating the measurement is reliable (Nunnally 1978). The CR value for each scale exceeds the acceptable level of 0.6 (Bagozzi and Yi 1988) ranging from 0.823 to 0.968, which indicated the measures for these constructs were highly reliable.Table 2 presents the reliability, validity, correlations and descriptive statistics for the variables in our model.

This suggests adequate discriminant validity between each construct. Moreover, the common method variance did not affect the outcome because the Harman's single factor was 42.17%, below the threshold of 50% (Podsakoff et al. 2003).Furthermore, discriminate validity was evaluated by the model fit indices using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).

        <p>To conduct mediation analysis, it is necessary to report the assumptions of the mediation model as Fairchild and Mackinnon (2009) also recommend. As shown in Table 3, the proposed path analysis model 1 and model 2 were better than reversed and interaction model, so reverse causality effects and predictor* mediator interaction effects are not severe.

            <rs type="version">14.0</rs> to check the correctness of the models' functional form, multi- collinearity and homogeneity of error variance, and omitted variables. According to the results of the Ramsy RESET test, the path analysis models have no omitted variables.

        <p>The direct impact of EE on EM is complex. The results show that extracurricular activity has a positive influence on EM and improves students' risk propensity, ambiguity tolerance, and alertness to opportunity (though not for dispositional optimism). This is in line with the findings of Neneh's (2012) study, although in that study the author only examined creativity, motivation and risk taking. This research indicates that education is a driving antecedent in the development of students' mindset.The direct impact of EE on EM is complex.

        <p>However, the results revealed that curriculum attendance does not positively influence entrepreneurial mindsets. On the contrary, it negatively affects the four mindsets at a significance level. This finding is consistent with Nabi's et al. (2018) argument that the effect of EE is variable and Arranz's et al. (2017) finding that the role of curricular elements on entrepreneurial competences is heterogeneous and unequal among different institutions. A possible explanation for the contradictory results could be related to the pedagogy of EE because the design of course contents and teaching methods could affect the learning outcomes of students. EE courses provided by the sampling institutions in this study may be taught using knowledge-based contents and traditional approaches. This may be particularly significant in the Chinese context, in which traditionally, Chinese education has been based on an objectivist view of knowledge and in which the didactic passive transmission of information has been dominant in education (Tan, 2017); however, this is outside the scope of this study.However, the results revealed that curriculum attendance does not positively influence entrepreneurial mindsets.

        <p>The results showed that EE has a positive impact on entrepreneurial inspiration, which in turn positively affects four specific mindsets of students. This is in line with Nabi's et al. (2018) and Souitaris, Zerbinati, and AI-Laham's (2007) findings. This research illustrated that EE can inspire students to make their mindset more entrepreneurial.The results showed that EE has a positive impact on entrepreneurial inspiration, which in turn positively affects four specific mindsets of students.

        <p>This research also found that the mediating role of entrepreneurial inspiration exists in the relationship between EE and EM. When this was probed by distinguishing the different aspects of EE, varying results were found. For curriculum attendance, the mediation effect of inspiration is strong, while for extracurricular activity, the mediation effect is partial. The findings thus provide an explorative answer to Nabi et al. (2017) who proposed that the mediating role of inspiration in EE and its impact is under researched and warrants further examination.This research also found that the mediating role of entrepreneurial inspiration exists in the relationship between EE and EM.

        <p>The results indicate that extracurricular activity has a greater effect on both inspiration and the four mindsets than curriculum attendance. It confirmed the critical role of the type of learning experiences (curriculum attendance or extracurricular activity) in the link of EE-EM. This finding was supported by an earlier study of Arranz et al. (2017) who also found a difference between curricular and extracurricular education in the development of EI, but nevertheless presents some differences because in this study the impact indicator is EM rather than EI. Theoretically, extracurricular activity played a more important role in generating EE outcome because this kind of learning occurred in informal situations with institutional resources (Laukkanen 2000) and relates to cognitive-emotional support and cultural awareness of entrepreneurship (Fayolle and Gailly 2015) which could deeply inspire students to be more entrepreneurial.The results indicate that extracurricular activity has a greater effect on both inspiration and the four mindsets than curriculum attendance.

        <p>However, this study could not find a significant effect difference of the type of course (compulsory or optional) on inspiration and mindsets. These findings conflict with that of Karimi et al. (2016) who concluded that students' intention was significantly raised by the elective course and that the rise of intention through compulsory coursework was not significant. In addition, contrary to expectation, the results demonstrated there is no significant effect of the type of activity (practical or theoretical) which is inconsistent with Piperopoulos and Dimov's (2015)However, this study could not find a significant effect difference of the type of course (compulsory or optional) on inspiration and mindsets.

        <p>This study has three implications for theory based on the conceptual model. Firstly, the results suggest that EM is an evolving learning outcome of EE and raises the question: can certain aspects of cognitive characteristics be taught and developed? EM is definitely not facts and skills to be learned but encompasses ways of thinking, reflecting deep cognitive structures of individuals (Krueger 2007;Naumann 2017). The EE-EM link thus deserves further exploration.This study has three implications for theory based on the conceptual model.

        <p>Finally, this study verified that curricular course has a weaker effect on EM than extracurricular activity, which may reflect the outcome of the pedagogical method of experiential learning in simulated or real-life entrepreneurial situations. This supports the assumption that pedagogical interventions might be a substantial reason for the inconsistencies in EE impact results. The findings indicate that it could be beneficial to explore the impact of pedagogical approaches on EE outcomes.Finally, this study verified that curricular course has a weaker effect on EM than extracurricular activity, which may reflect the outcome of the pedagogical method of experiential learning in simulated or real-life entrepreneurial situations.

        <p>In terms of practical implication, the research findings are important for policy makers from government and higher education institutions. Firstly, it confirms the value of EE initiatives by the government and universities, which encourages government policymakers to support universities and colleges with further funding to ensure EE is accessible to all students. Secondly, as EE is helpful to develop students' inspiration and mindset, it should be integrated into the coherent framework of general education in universities to prepare more entrepreneurial students for future study, work, and living.In terms of practical implication, the research findings are important for policy makers from government and higher education institutions.

        <p>Thirdly, as inspiration appears to be a crucial benefit from EE and a strong predictor of EM, instruction designers may focus more on inspiration triggers within curricula.

        <p>This research was designed to examine the impact of entrepreneurship education on students' entrepreneurial mindsets in higher education in China. To address the objective, a mediating model was designed to explore the relationship between EE and EM using a cross-sectional survey to collect data that supported both the measurement and the structural model.

Key findings are manifested in the following aspects.</p>
        <p>Firstly, the influences of EE are heterogeneous due to the multifaceted nature of learning experiences in higher education. Extracurricular activity positively affects students' EM, while curriculum attendance negatively affects that. Secondly, EE affects entrepreneurial inspiration which in turn stimulates students' EM, verifying the mediating role of entrepreneurial inspiration. Thirdly, students' involvement in extracurricular activity generates a positive influence on their EM greater than curriculum attendance, which supports the role of learning experience in the EE-EM link.Firstly, the influences of EE are heterogeneous due to the multifaceted nature of learning experiences in higher education.

        <p>The second contribution is the two-dimensional nature of EE and its divergent effect on EM. This finding, with the insight into the inner part of EE, may be a possible explanation of why the results of EE research are sometimes conflicting in the literature (e.g. Oosterbeek, van Praag, and Ijsselstein 2010). By unpacking the different twodimensional effects of EE, this study makes our understanding more nuanced and precise regarding the effectiveness of EE. Thirdly, the research highlighted a dynamic mechanism of EE impact on learning outcomes. A portrait of EE with a basic distinction between curricular and extracurricular becomes theoretically meaningful in explaining the EE impact outcomes.The second contribution is the two-dimensional nature of EE and its divergent effect on EM.

        <p>By considering the mediating variables in the model, the present study revealed that EE impact is to some extent emotional (inspiration) driven and pedagogical (learning experiences) sensitive which answered not only whether, but also how, EE affects EM in higher education settings.By considering the mediating variables in the model, the present study revealed that EE impact is to some extent emotional (inspiration) driven and pedagogical (learning experiences) sensitive which answered not only whether, but also how, EE affects EM in higher education settings.</p>

        <p>This research only addressed the impact of EE on EM within the framework of general education in China. However, intention and even actual action were not considered.

        <p>This study examined the effect of EE on EM whilst considering the role of curriculum attendance and extra-curricular activity, using relatively simplistic dichotomous variables.
