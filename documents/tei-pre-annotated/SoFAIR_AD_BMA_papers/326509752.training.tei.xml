        <p>Utilizing a sample of 192 hospitality firms, this study investigates the moderating role of a dynamic environment, coupled with business and social networking ties and technology resources, on the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and organizational performance in hospitality firms. This research is novel in that we adopt business network ties and social network ties as two moderating variables along with technology resources between entrepreneurial orientation and business performance, providing evidence on a topic which has received little attention to date. The results posit that in an uncertain, dynamic environment a higher level of risk and entrepreneurial orientation benefit business performance especially when coupled with strong business and social networks.Utilizing a sample of 192 hospitality firms, this study investigates the moderating role of a dynamic environment, coupled with business and social networking ties and technology resources, on the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and organizational performance in hospitality firms.

        <p>Traditionally the performance of hospitality organizations has been studied from the point of destination brand/reputation (e.g., image, perceived service quality, price) (e.g., Gomez et al., 2013), attractions (e.g., adventure, architecture, natural resources and endowments) (e.g., Alhemoud &amp; Armstrong, 1996;Mussalam &amp; Tajeddini, 2016), infrastructure (e.g., efficiency of transportation, shopping, sports facilities) (Molina-Azorin et al., 2010), and services (e.g., quality and variety of accommodation, food and wine) (e.g., Henderson, 2011;Roxas &amp; Chadee, 2013).Traditionally the performance of hospitality organizations has been studied from the point of destination brand/reputation (e.g., image, perceived service quality, price) (e.g., Gomez et al., 2013), attractions (e.g., adventure, architecture, natural resources and endowments) (e.g., Alhemoud &amp; Armstrong, 1996;Mussalam &amp; Tajeddini, 2016), infrastructure (e.g., efficiency of transportation, shopping, sports facilities) (Molina-Azorin et al., 2010), and services (e.g., quality and variety of accommodation, food and wine) (e.g., Henderson, 2011;Roxas &amp; Chadee, 2013).</p>
        <p>However, recently a number of hospitality scholars (Fu et al., 2019;Moghaddam et al., 2018;Omerzel, 2016;Taheri et al., 2019;Vega-Vázquez et al., 2016) have seen entrepreneurship and innovation as having a critical role in shaping this global industry and have advocated for further research (Peters &amp; Kallmunzer, 2018). Entrepreneurial activities have been examined as an antecedent of growth, competitive advantage and superior performance. Despite the rising interest in entrepreneurial activities, the contemporary hospitality literature proposes that the field is lacking of strong theoretical frameworks related to this essential entrepreneurial orientation (EO) (Fadda, 2018;Hernández-Perlines, 2016;Tajeddini, 2015).However, recently a number of hospitality scholars (Fu et al., 2019;Moghaddam et al., 2018;Omerzel, 2016;Taheri et al., 2019;Vega-Vázquez et al., 2016) have seen entrepreneurship and innovation as having a critical role in shaping this global industry and have advocated for further research (Peters &amp; Kallmunzer, 2018).

        <p>Moreover, the current uncertain and highly competitive marketplace leads hospitality firms to face various economic, financial and sociocultural problems to deliver superior value to customers (O'Cass &amp; Sok, 2015). Indeed, research indicates that hospitality firms have encountered greater levels of risk and competition than other industries (Kwun &amp; Oh, 2004) due to the crowded and homogeneous marketplace (Morgan et al., 2014), low entry and high exit barriers (Lee et al., 2016) and price conscious customers (Assaf et al., 2011;Singal, 2015). In response hospitality firms have learnt to embrace an entrepreneurial spirit and introduce new products or services (Anderson et al., 2015;Lee, et al., 2016) moving towards a more decentralized and organic organizational structures (Tajeddini et al., 2017).Moreover, the current uncertain and highly competitive marketplace leads hospitality firms to face various economic, financial and sociocultural problems to deliver superior value to customers (O'Cass &amp; Sok, 2015).

        <p>The inherent multi-experiential nature of hospitality firms require an entrepreneurial mindset to seek, and capture, the opportunities to offer unique experiences (e.g., new services, new package holidays) to travelers de factor global in scope, hospitality is one of the main economics antecedents of a great number of nations (French et al., 2017) and entail a multitude of services, facilities and attractions that create many entrepreneurial opportunities (Fadda, 2018). Nevertheless, research about how these organizations utilize entrepreneurial capabilities and competencies to engage in and benefit from EO remains under developed (Omerzel, 2016;Roxas &amp; Chadee, 2013). In particular, Tajeddini (2010) argues that research capturing EO in the field is largely phenomenological and underrepresented. Subsequently, this is a contradiction in the hospitality field; on the one hand, the EO of these businesses is taken for granted, while on the other hand, empirical research that exploring EO in hospitality firms is lacking (Taheri et al., 2019;Vega-Vázquez et al., 2016).The inherent multi-experiential nature of hospitality firms require an entrepreneurial mindset to seek, and capture, the opportunities to offer unique experiences (e.g., new services, new package holidays) to travelers de factor global in scope, hospitality is one of the main economics antecedents of a great number of nations (French et al., 2017) and entail a multitude of services, facilities and attractions that create many entrepreneurial opportunities (Fadda, 2018).

        <p>The heightened dynamic environment (Achrol, 1991) calls for cooperation, partnership and strategic alliances (Jiang et al., 2016). Resource sharing to create value (Jiang et al., 2016) and the formation of partnerships to promote innovation and enhance financial return are emerging (Xie et al., 2010) as can be seen with formalized overbooking collaborations. This bond of mutual trust with business partners and stakeholders is essential for the sustainable success and development of hospitality businesses. Cooperative entrepreneurial firms' relationships develop over time wherein mutual trust and commitment are established between partners (Adjei et al., 2009). It becomes more evident in the hospitality industry where a sizable number of firms are micro, geographically fragmented and interdependent in nature, thus with constrained resources under uncertainties (Ying et al., 2016). The co-operation between these firms can reinforce decision quality, overcome impasse, strengthen bonds between stakeholders and offer a platform for developing formal and informal inter-organizational collaboration and partnerships, thereby they are characterized as a networked system (Adongo &amp; Kim, 2018;Gao et al., 2017;Ying et al., 2016). The nature of service business demands that organizations interact with their consumers and company partners utilizing cooperative networks to deliver safe, reliable, and professional services at the highest possible value across international borders (Kandampully, 2002;O'Cass &amp; Sok, 2015). Lechner et al. (2006) stress that networks in the service industry are predominantly vital for the expansion and accomplishment of innovative organizations and supply a noteworthy source of sustainable competitive advantage.The heightened dynamic environment (Achrol, 1991) calls for cooperation, partnership and strategic alliances (Jiang et al., 2016).

        <p>The arrival of emergent players in the lodging services has put even more pressure on the tourism and travel industry (Priporas et al., 2017). This industry is rapidly changing. Such dynamic and uncertain environments require hospitality firms to strengthen their abilities to be innovative, proactive and risk taking (Priporas et al., 2017).

        <p>This research scrutinizes the moderating role of the dynamic environment and network ties on the relationship between entrepreneurial strategy-making, long term growth and short term financial return. The paper aims to bring together these previously researched areas to explore the relationship between the component parts. In doing so highlighting when these factors have most impact on the hospitality industry. We do so due to the divergent views currently existing on the relationship with EO and a firm's performance. Previous work ranges from positive (Covin &amp; Miller, 2014;Lomberg et al., 2016) to insignificant (Covin &amp; Slevin, 1989;George et al., 2001) and thus comprehending and understanding the complexity of EO is pertinent.This research scrutinizes the moderating role of the dynamic environment and network ties on the relationship between entrepreneurial strategy-making, long term growth and short term financial return.

        <p>This paper proposes that in a dynamic environment the level of networking hospitality businesses undertake is an important component to EO and long and short term business performance. The work goes further as it also explores the relationship and influence of both business and social networks, empirically studying different combinations of high/low business and social network ties and the interplay of these network ties and the dynamic environment. The findings support hospitality managers in taking greater risks in dynamic environments and leveraging networks to realize enhanced performance. For this study, we define and measure business "performance" in two respects: growth and financial return. Utilizing data gathered from 192 Japanese hospitality firms, this research offers and examines plausible assumptions concerning the interactive impacts of EO, dynamic environment and networking on service company growth and financial return.This paper proposes that in a dynamic environment the level of networking hospitality businesses undertake is an important component to EO and long and short term business performance.

        <p>Entrepreneurial orientation, often referred to as entrepreneurial strategy-making, has been characterized as an attribute of management style that favors change and supports activities related to exploiting different forms of innovation, new product/service development and the creation of superior customer value. When embedded within strategic decision-making, EO plays an important role in firms' developing, commercializing and aggressively pursuing new products and service development and anticipating and responding to contingencies (Hernández-Perlines, 2016;Rauch et al., 2009). EO is underpinned by distinct strategic orientation which collectively enhances business outcomes by creating new knowledge required for establishing new capabilities and re-energizing existing resources and capabilities, fostering an innovative mindset within the firm under differing turbulent and competitive environments (Cavusgil &amp; Knight, 6 2015;Jalilvand et al., 2018;Martin &amp; Javalgi, 2016;Taheri et al., 2019). Arguably, a business with a strong EO focuses on gaining a superior performance by building a value-creating strategy which other competitors are unable to duplicate the benefits, or find it too costly to imitate. Therefore, entrepreneurship represents an organizational strategic orientation by foregoing profits in the short term and investing in higher risk opportunities for longer-run benefits and value creation. As a result, such firms proactively produce novel and innovative products or services, creatively outperforming rivals (Hernández-Perlines, 2016;Martin &amp; Javalgi, 2016;Miller, 1983) and earning an above industry-average compensation (entrepreneurial surplus) (Mishra, 2017). Conversely, more risk-averse businesses appear more likely to pursue an incremental process putting greater emphasis on short-term success and financial gains determined by profitability and productivity. These non-entrepreneurial organizations prefer to imitate products and services rather than innovating themselves. Their risk aversion is high and more likely they are market followers rather than leaders.Entrepreneurial orientation, often referred to as entrepreneurial strategy-making, has been characterized as an attribute of management style that favors change and supports activities related to exploiting different forms of innovation, new product/service development and the creation of superior customer value.

        <p>The relationship between a firm's performance and EO has been well established in a variety of fields such as banking (e.g., Niemand et al., 2017), international businesses (e.g., Balabanis &amp; Katsikea, 2003), travel agency (Taheri et al., 2019) and hospitality (Hernández-Perlines, 2016;Jogaratnam, &amp; Tse, 2006). All of these studies indicate that EO plays a positive role in an organization's overall performance. Nevertheless, Lumpkin and Dess (1996) argue EO should be regarded as a context-specific. More recently Fu et al. (2019) stress that EO should be investigated and analyzed in different settings due to the variances in industry characteristics such as life cycle and dynamism.The relationship between a firm's performance and EO has been well established in a variety of fields such as banking (e.g., Niemand et al., 2017), international businesses (e.g., Balabanis &amp; Katsikea, 2003), travel agency (Taheri et al., 2019) and hospitality (Hernández-Perlines, 2016;Jogaratnam, &amp; Tse, 2006).

        <p>Scholars have stressed the idiosyncratic nature of hospitality offerings and internationalization strategies which require particular industry-based attention (Dorado &amp; Ventresca, 2013;Fu et al., 2019). The hospitality industry differs from the other industries where they focus more on lifestyle, personality, and culture (Liu &amp; Mattila, 2017). Often hospitality firms are regarded as archetypal entrepreneurial industries (Morrison et al., 2004) embracing qualities such as risk-tolerance, resource mobilization competences (Narangajavana et al., 2017), innovativeness and proactiveness (Demary, 2017), economic growth (Webster &amp; Ivanov, 2014), job creation, change, development and innovation (Ball, 2005); new venture creation (Andringa et al., 2016). Hospitality businesses are not protected by tradition, destinations are not able to stay still as demand for new experiences and repeat visits continually pushes for new experiences and continued drive to develop product and services. Entrepreneurial activities may foster a firm's innovative capability with a consequential impact on financial return and business outcomes (Hallak et al., 2014;Schuckert et al., 2015).Scholars have stressed the idiosyncratic nature of hospitality offerings and internationalization strategies which require particular industry-based attention (Dorado &amp; Ventresca, 2013;Fu et al., 2019).

        <p>Previous studies have indeed shown that higher levels of EO are positively associated with improved hospitality and tourism firm performance (e.g., Roxas &amp; Chadee, 2013). In practice, the opportunity for hospitality service companies to take financial risks and proactively deploy resources to new opportunities can vary widely (De Clercq et al., 2010;Taheri et al., 2019). This study posits that EO has a positive impact on hospitality and tourism organizations' performance in terms of long-term growth and short term financial return.

        <p>Dynamism of the environment can be conceptualized as the rate of change and the magnitude of unpredictability, e.g. alteration in technologies, variations in consumer preferences and market demands (Tajeddini &amp; Mueller, 2019). The impact of firm's resources, capabilities and competencies on a firm's behavior and operations are reliant on these environmental dynamism cues (Koberg et al., 1996). As competition increases and customer preferences change, a faster pace evolves and the environment becomes more dynamic. As a result, the development stage from product introduction to withdrawal becomes shorter. The introduction of new tangible and intangible goods is more frequent, information becomes outdated quicker (Tajeddini &amp; Mueller, 2019). Thus, it is more complicated and difficult for firms to assimilate and predict environmental conditions, to discover the possible effects of innovative technological changes on consumer needs and behavior, and to explain them into specific and relevant activities (Kabadayi et al., 2007). For example, the arrival of Airbnb, a fast-paced business gradually disrupting the hospitality industry and creating a dynamic and competitive new operating environment. Such competitive pressure coupled with fluctuating tourism demand and low levels of service differentiation among lodging industry has created an intensification of pressure on management to devise novel approaches for beating rivals (Priporas et al., 2017).Dynamism of the environment can be conceptualized as the rate of change and the magnitude of unpredictability, e.g. alteration in technologies, variations in consumer preferences and market demands (Tajeddini &amp; Mueller, 2019).

        <p>Organizations effectively operating in a dynamic setting are more prone to succeed where the expenditure and level of risk related to innovation, can be retained by capturing new market niches (Koberg et al., 1996). In such an environment, companies are required to monitor marketing practices, leverage their relationship quality with customers, and undertake high levels of service/product innovation augmentation. This stimulates substantial tangible and intangible investments in innovation-related activities to improve existing products, or develop new products (Adjei et al., 2009;Nandakumar et al., 2010). Uncertainty is high about competitive products, market requirements shifts quickly and new product development is a more complex (Hult et al., 2007). Thus, we assume, H 2 : Dynamic environment strengthens the connection between EO and tourism business performance.Organizations effectively operating in a dynamic setting are more prone to succeed where the expenditure and level of risk related to innovation, can be retained by capturing new market niches (Koberg et al., 1996).

        <p>Network ties can be defined as the extent individuals, firms, management or entrepreneurs of the same network tie to each other. These can be either strong or weak. Strong-tie relationships are described by frequent interaction between individuals, entrepreneurs and firms with similar interest. This tends to reinforce and develop insights and new ideas. Weak-tie relationships, however, are characterized by infrequent interactions between casual acquaintances (Barringer &amp; Ireland, 2016). Arguably strong network ties facilitate communication, cooperation, frequent exchanges of information and greater dissemination of knowledge across the organization. This results significant reductions in total costs (Kraatz, 1998), stable and balanced business operations (Gavirneni, 2002) and improves innovation (Goes &amp; Park, 1997). According to Lee et al. (2009), strong-tie relationships are triggered by a sense of companionship, comfort, security and are part of a multi-layered strategic relationship.Network ties can be defined as the extent individuals, firms, management or entrepreneurs of the same network tie to each other.

As Menor and Roth (2008) stress, world-class organizations are able to create dynamic processes through strong network ties that foster accelerated information flows along with other capabilities providing sustainable competitive position in the global market.Entrepreneurial firms utilize business networking as a vehicle to connect more with each other counterparts to enhance efficiency operation (Barringer &amp; Ireland, 2016).

        <p>There has been research on the role of EO in a dynamic environment (Covin &amp; Slevin 1989;Wiklund &amp; Shepherd, 2005), the mediating effects of network resource acquisition (Jiang et al., 2018) information orientation (Keh et al., 2007), and technology action (Choi &amp; Williams, 2016). Recently, using network theory, Jiang et al. (2018) find that the acquisition of resources from a firm's networks (business and government) is a mechanism by which EO enhances a firm's performance. These scholars focus on the mediating role of the network in resource acquisition. Using networks as a mediating variable in the external environment, whether the influence is increased in a dynamic environment is key to this study as the speed of change hospitality firms are experiencing is unprecedented.There has been research on the role of EO in a dynamic environment (Covin &amp; Slevin 1989;Wiklund &amp; Shepherd, 2005), the mediating effects of network resource acquisition (Jiang et al., 2018) information orientation (Keh et al., 2007), and technology action (Choi &amp; Williams, 2016).

        <p>Entrepreneurial firms have a propensity to be more innovative where information flows establish an arrangement and relationship for quick interactions between agents (Tajeddini &amp; Trueman, 2016). Business networking has been well documented particularly the networks contribution to destination development (cf. Heidari et al., 2018. Kelliher et al., 2009;Kim &amp; Shim, 2018;Tinsley &amp; Lynch, 2001;Welch &amp; Wilkinson, 2002) and knowledge exchange within networks are seen as the creation of learning communities. Indeed, as Kelliher et al. (2009) point out tourism development agencies have specifically facilitated these business networks in small hospitality firms to proactively help these entrepreneurs learn and regions develop. Arguably, the actor bonds, resource ties along with activity links and within entrepreneurial hospitality firms may evolve in a single dyadic relationship, connecting to a wider web of actors, activity patterns and resource constellations influencing the business network (Gao et al., 2017;Tinsley &amp; Lynch, 2001). Thus, we propose, H 3 : Business network ties strengthen the connection between EO and tourism business outcomes.Entrepreneurial firms have a propensity to be more innovative where information flows establish an arrangement and relationship for quick interactions between agents (Tajeddini &amp; Trueman, 2016).

        <p>As Lien and Cao (2014) report, leveraging social contacts also enables organizations to enhance business performance. Social networks are, hence, also critical sources of information for individuals and organizations. According to Statista (2017), the number of social network users has increased substantially from 2.14 billion in 2015 to 2.46 billion in 2017, and is anticipated to reach 3.02 billion by 2020. Social network relationships can be defined as the individual's social ties with other social actors such as friends, family, colleagues, customers, clients, or managers with the similar interest. The emergence of informal social networks has led to an unprecedented level of information sharing (Kivinen &amp; Tumennasan, 2019). Social media applications are effective for diffusion of information, interpersonal ties that provide sociability, support, information, a sense of belonging shared personal opinions, thoughts, experiences and social identity (Alalwan et al., 2017;Dickinson et al., 2017;Golzardi et al., 2019). The critical role of social networking has broadly been discussed in marketing practice and an entrepreneurial venture due to its nature of sharing information and operational interactions (Engel et al., 2017).As Lien and Cao (2014) report, leveraging social contacts also enables organizations to enhance business performance.

        <p>These firms have utilized social networks as a vehicle to create more effective promotional strategies and aspirational branding where customer's interactivity, involvement and relationships are stimulated and their experience is shared. Entrepreneurs build social capital through social networks to benefit from social participation. Social media applications are represented in virtual platforms (e.g., Instagram, Flickr, LinkedIn, YouTube, Digg, Google Reader, Facebook, and Twitter) and have become an indispensable means for the tourism and hospitality industry by transforming travelers from passive to active co-producers of experiences about peer-to-peer accommodation and tourism service recommendations (Ge &amp; Gretzel, 2018;Xiang &amp; Gretzel, 2010), thereby they influence business performance (Chung et al., 2017). Thus, we hypothesize, H 4 : Social network ties strengthen the connection between EO and service business outcomes.These firms have utilized social networks as a vehicle to create more effective promotional strategies and aspirational branding where customer's interactivity, involvement and relationships are stimulated and their experience is shared.

        <p>Technology resources in organizations refer to process-specific informatics technologies that are employed to support particular processes (Ray et al., 2004). Successful firms require not only capabilities in the areas of corporate, business and functional planning and strategy, comprehensive financial projections, and resources allocation, but also information technology resources and capabilities (e.g., technical IT skills, knowledge, infrastructure) for operational processes. The technology resources employed in service industry include networks with representatives, web-enabled customer interaction, computer-telephone integration (CTI) among others (Cohen &amp; Olsen, 2013). Although technology resources are valuable, they can be duplicated easily with insignificant cost and may not affect directly to the business performance (Hadjimanolis &amp; Dickson, 2001). Thus, they may not directly influence business performance.Technology resources in organizations refer to process-specific informatics technologies that are employed to support particular processes (Ray et al., 2004).

        <p>Given the possible benefits of technology resources yet along with other organization's heterogeneous resource portfolios (e.g., skills, knowledge, capitals, and technology resources) as valuable, it is somewhat surprising that research has not extensively explored moderating impact of technology resources on the possible link between EO and service business performance (Cohen &amp; Olsen, 2013). In an entrepreneurial firm, however, they might affect on the association between EO and service performance (Figure A).

        <p>Japan was selected as the location for the data collection due to the substantial growth rate of the tourism industry. Tourism is increasingly becoming vital for Japan's economy (Honma &amp; Hu, 2012) with a continuous rising trend in average day to day rates since 2012 (Sawayanagi et al., 2014). According to a published report by McKinsey Japan and Travel, from 2011 to 2015, Japan's inbound tourism grew by 33% a year (Andonian et al., 2016). In 2016, the gross domestic product (GDP) contribution of tourism in Japan was USD110.5bn, (2.4% of GDP), generating 4,474,000 jobs (6.9% of total employment) and estimating 7% of total employment (OECD, 2017). According to World Travel and Tourism Council (2018), Japan invested in Travel and Tourism around JPY3,739.6 bn, 3.5 per cent of total investment (USD34.4bn) in 2016 forecasted to maintain 4,854,000 jobs (7.6 per cent of total employment), an increase of 1.0 per cent pa over the period and visitor exports generated JPY3,521.7bn (USD32.4bn), 4.4 per cent of total exports in 2016. This growth was driven by various factors such as Abenomics (i.e. reform in economic and financial policies coupled with governmental reforms), depreciation of the Japanese yen, sustaining the tourism and hospitality industries by the Japanese governments' programs which includes the formation of the Japan Tourism Agency (JTA) in 2008, the launch of the Visit Japan Campaign, the relaxation of visas for tourists and increased advertising (Andonian et al., 2016). As a result of these efforts, the country enjoyed a 5 th straight record year of boosted arrivals and tourism spending in 2017. Japan's policy makers have set an aspirational target to increase inbound tourism to 40 million in 2020, triple the annual number of visitor nights in non-metropolitan areas from 2015 to 2020 (Andonian et al., 2016). The government has supported up to 50% of construction costs for new hotels and has suggested the state-run Japan Finance Corp along with other loan lenders to provide suitable financial support to such accommodations to help you through the renovation process smoothly in line with the state's plan (Reubi, 2017). The flow of foreign prominent brand hotels has also contributed substantially to the high growth rate of hotels in Japan (JETRO, 2009).Japan was selected as the location for the data collection due to the substantial growth rate of the tourism industry.

        <p>Our knowledge of the roles of entrepreneurial activities and networking in gaining and sustaining competitive advantage has been gained predominantly through a traditional hypotheticodeductive approach (cf. Tajeddini &amp; Mueller, 2012) utilizing survey questionnaires or brief interviews. However, to avert the researchers from drawing inconsistent conclusions (Cresswell &amp; Plano-Clark, 2007) and to better understand the nuances of the concepts and their relationships, we commenced with a qualitative pilot study which was then followed with a quantitative survey of hospitality firms. This pilot study prior to the survey was important for three reasons. First, it helped in refining the items/activities included in the questionnaire (Avlonitis &amp; Papastathopoulou, 2001;Kim, 2010;Sampson, 2004;Yin, 2014). Secondly, it preempted possible challenges that may have occurred in the data collection and analysis process (Arain et al., 2010;Kim, 2010) by providing a deeper understanding of the Japanese context and lastly it revealed that building relationships through networking is crucial.Our knowledge of the roles of entrepreneurial activities and networking in gaining and sustaining competitive advantage has been gained predominantly through a traditional hypotheticodeductive approach (cf.

Some typical questions were: 'How do you seek opportunities?', 'How do you make decisions on investments that might involve risk? 'Do you regularly seek to introduce new products?', 'Do you change your marketing practices and strategy rarely or extremely frequently? 'Do you have any good connections with your business partners (i.e. customers, competitors)? 'Do you use social media to disseminate information and to engage with influential people in your industry?' All interviews lasted approximately 60 minutes and were transcribed verbatim for maximum comparability. Transcripts were broken down into separate parts and meaning units were used to discover the important segments of the text (cf. Nowell et al., 2017). During the analysis, emerging themes were identified and compared. Overarching themes were extracted through keywords seeking to encompass a broad array of sub-themes that fall under the topics to capture repetitions (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006).Instead of simply rolling the planned conceptual theory relationships, these interviews explored what these tourism service managers perceive about the meaning and domain of our constructs from the literature and to estimate the face validity of the measurement scales used in the survey.

        <p>Three key themes emerged from the pilot interviews which were entrepreneurial dimensions, networks and the environment. Respondents indicated a lack or weak tendency towards proactivity and risk taking with one interviewee stating "our limited budget does not allow us to be the first mover and often times we assess the market to adopt something new to offer". Networking was frequently emphasized by respondents who indicated that sociality and interactions with customers, suppliers, and competitors were important to their business. This is affirmed by the following quote "it is unimaginable not to use social networking to understand our position in the market, our customers' perceptions, their needs and desires". For example, in Japan it is very common to attend Nomikai (drinking party) for professional networking purposes with colleagues and clients. During Nomikai, people express themselves and use it as a vehicle to talk about their personal and business lives and exchange their business cards to announce their identities showing a sense of belonging. Regarding social networking, the respondents stated that it is very important for them to attach to their communities though joining different group activities and community services. Such undertakings help them build trust and cement relationships. During the interviews, several informants established the significance of the two networking ties (business and social). These interviews also confirmed the important of the business environment as evidenced form the following quote "we regularly observe our competitors and update our promotions methods accordingly". Appendix A provides an overview of other key quotes for these three key themes. This element of the study was effective to refine the themes by revisiting the concepts, ratifying interpretations and provided a better understanding of the possible relationship between the variables.Three key themes emerged from the pilot interviews which were entrepreneurial dimensions, networks and the environment.

        <p>The sampling frame for the quantitative study consisted of 500 Japanese hospitality firms (e.g., hotels, resorts) randomly selected from different regions in Tokyo. Back translation was performed to ensure a rigorous verification process for translation validity and conceptual consistency. After pre-testing the scale items with two Japanese academics, a pretest was conducted with 60 managers from 30 service firms (2 managers each) in Tokyo. This procedure ensured the clarity of the Japanese version of the survey items, certified the quality of the research design and minimized any difficulties with the questions for the respondents. To address potential social desirability bias and to amplify the enthusiasm of key respondents, explicit promise for anonymity and confidentiality was guaranteed.The sampling frame for the quantitative study consisted of 500 Japanese hospitality firms (e.g., hotels, resorts) randomly selected from different regions in Tokyo.

Two survey questionnaires per organization were used to mitigate common method bias and to diminish the particular source bias. The top managers, owners and chief executive officer were asked to introduce one or two more informants from their firms, who were the most experienced and knowledgeable about the firm's operations, service innovation process, firm performance to fill in the survey questionnaires. The first informant (recognized as manager or owner) evaluated business performance, entrepreneurial orientation and environmental dynamism. The second informant assessed networking ties and technology resources as well as the firm's relationship environmental dynamism and entrepreneurial orientation (both respondents responding to entrepreneurial orientation and environmental dynamism allowed for investigation of consistency within the firm). The above two sources of information were then merged as one dataset per tourism firm (i.e., unit of analysis).Over a period of five months, a total of 470 remaining hospitality and tourism service organizations (two surveys per firm, 940 questionnaires) were sent by postal mail accompanied by self-addressed and stamped return envelopes.

        <p>To enhance the motivation of respondents, explicit assurance was given that no individual responses would be revealed by the research team and individual or organizational identifying factors would be removed. No explicit incentive was offered and a total of three reminders were utilized. As a result, twenty one firms responded with only one survey and since we inquired for multiple responses from companies, we removed these organizations' surveys from our final assessments. A series of 28 phone calls were made to respondents to assure key informant quality. Of the 227 responses (i.e., firms), 14 completed surveys were eliminated because of extreme missing data. A final sample of 192 firms (40.85 % response rate) was achieved. T-tests were employed to early and late respondents to verify any potential issue with non-response error. Different variables such as firm age, firm size, proactiveness, risk taking and innovativeness were incorporated to evaluate t-values. The findings of t-values were between 0.18 and 0.53, demonstrating no substantial distinctions between these two clusters (p &gt; .05), thus the possibility of a non-response error was negligible.To enhance the motivation of respondents, explicit assurance was given that no individual responses would be revealed by the research team and individual or organizational identifying factors would be removed.

        <p>To determine EO, the nine-item measurement was adopted from Covin and Slevin (1989) entailing three elements of strategic posture: innovation, risk-taking and proactiveness. Past studies operationally delineated entrepreneurial strategy-making as an aggregate scale of three components (Miller, 1983;van Doorn et al., 2017). These multidimensional variables reveal top management's behavior in making strategic decisions to shape a company's future and involve generating long term goals and plans to achieve them (see Table 1a).To determine EO, the nine-item measurement was adopted from Covin and Slevin (1989) entailing three elements of strategic posture: innovation, risk-taking and proactiveness.

        <p>Environmental dynamism mirrors the rate of any alteration or transformation in organizational design and structure, consumer inclinations, equipment, competitors' action, rules, policies and regulations, as well as the surrounding and environmental factors (Tajeddini &amp; Trueman, 2016). Five opposite established items taken from Khandwalla (1977), to assess firms' environmental conditions were used. These items point out the level of alteration in management practice, rate of products obsolescence, forecast of business rivals' actions and anticipating the consumer preference and production modes. Participants were requested to indicate whether their organizational external environment was stable vs. dynamic and predictable vs. unpredictable (see Table 1b).Environmental dynamism mirrors the rate of any alteration or transformation in organizational design and structure, consumer inclinations, equipment, competitors' action, rules, policies and regulations, as well as the surrounding and environmental factors (Tajeddini &amp; Trueman, 2016).

        <p>While objective performance measures are far more desirable than subjective performance measures, we were unable to access the hard financial information partly because managers were not willing to reveal the information. Despite these challenges, prior research has documented a strong correlation between subjective responses and objective measures (Jaworski &amp; Kohli, 1993). Thus, we used the six-item scale to evaluate a company's growth (as a proxy for long-term performance) and financial return (as a proxy for short term performance). Informants were requested to assess these facets over the last 3 years relative to their main rivals.While objective performance measures are far more desirable than subjective performance measures, we were unable to access the hard financial information partly because managers were not willing to reveal the information.

        <p>To measure technology resources in customer service, a six-item scale was adopted from (Ray et al., 2004) to evaluate the range of the technology resources/applications deployed to endorse the process of customer service. Fornell and Larcker (1981) recommended two criteria should be met for convergent validity. Firstly, the factor loading of each item of the scales should be significant and over .7 and to minimize measurement error, the average variance extracted (AVE) should be over .5. As Table 3b shows, each factor loading is significant at the 5 per cent significance level ranging from .71 to .96, resting above the recommended level of .7, whereas the lowest AVE of the constructs is .63, showing convergent validity. Composite reliabilities (CR) were performed to estimate the amount to which items was free from random error. The CR and AVE of all constructs point out above the suggested cutoff (AVE&gt;.5 and CR&gt;.7) (Table 1a and1b). Chi-square difference tests was conducted (76/2=21) for all major constructs (i.e., EO, dynamic environment, social and business networks, financial return and growth) in pairs to verify if the constrained model presented was significantly worse than the unconstrained model.To measure technology resources in customer service, a six-item scale was adopted from (Ray et al., 2004) to evaluate the range of the technology resources/applications deployed to endorse the process of customer service.

        <p>Following the recommendation of Venkatraman, (1989), two distinct sets of calculations were employed for the confirmation of unidimensionality and convergent validity. In the beginning, we computed the estimated correlation between a certain item and the latent construct it represented. The results indicated that the z-values of the coefficients of all the estimates were significant at the 5 per cent significance level (z-values&gt;± 1.96, p&lt;.05). Second, we examined the measurement model to evaluate the possibility of its' fit to the data observing a chi-square (χ 2 ) examination and adjunct fit indexes. Table 2 indicated that all the factor loadings of all the latent variables were significant (t&gt;2.0). Furthermore, the shared variances between pairs of all probable variables signified that the AVEs were higher than the related shared variance in all cases, further supporting the notion of convergent validity. To examine the likelihood effect of multicollinearity between the interaction effects, mean centered each measurement scale was assessed to represent an interaction term (the moderators along with the independent variable) and generated the interaction terms by multiplying the relevant mean-centered scales.Following the recommendation of Venkatraman, (1989), two distinct sets of calculations were employed for the confirmation of unidimensionality and convergent validity.

        <p>Multicollinearity between the variables could influence the results. Thus, two multicollinearity tests were performed: variance inflation factors (VIFs) and condition indices (CIs). The largest VIF emerged from the interaction between EO and environmental dynamism, with a value of 2.371, below the 10 benchmark. Condition indices (CIs) were examined utilizing the square roots of the ratios of the largest eigenvalue to each suggestive eigenvalue. The maximum condition indices extracted showing that all were less than 9.816. The maximum condition number was lower than both stringent (15.0) and lax (30.0) threshold values (see Belsley, 1991), thereby multicollinearity was unlikely to be a problem in our empirical data.Multicollinearity between the variables could influence the results.

        <p>To diminish any common method variation, the scale items were cautiously observed to determine that they were straightforward, explicit and short. A Harman's ex post one-factor examination was run to present a further verification for CMV. The factor analyses showed that nine factors had eigenvalues greater than 1.0, explained by 71.705% of the total variance. Factor 1 explained 25.340% of the variance (less than the most of the total variance), CMV seemed not to be an issue (Podsakoff &amp; Organ, 1986;Tsai &amp; Yang, 2014). Furthermore, a one-factor model was computed to compare with the measurement model. The results showed chi square = 734.15 with 198 df indicating there were no issues with CMV. Furthermore, CMV was calculated by incorporating a marker variable (MV) in the survey questionnaire between the independent variable and the other independent variables (see Lindell &amp; Whitney, 2001). A six-item socialization scale to measure 'socially desirable responding' was adopted from Strahan and Gerbasi (1972) to serve as a proxy of the MV. This scale was selected because it had no theoretical association with any of the items employed in the current research. The measurement scale of 'socially desirable responding' indicated satisfactory reliability (Cronbach's alpha = .81).To diminish any common method variation, the scale items were cautiously observed to determine that they were straightforward, explicit and short.

Although not hypothesized, Model 2 in Table 3 shows that environmental dynamism was positively related to business growth (β =.271, p&lt;.001, model 2) and financial return (β =.332, p&lt;.001, model 9). Business network ties was also found to have positive effect on growth (β =.280, p&lt;.01, model 2) and financial return (β =.418, p&lt;.001, model 9).

        <p>While the results indicate that the interaction terms (EO × business network tie (BT); EO × social network ties (SN)) on growth performance were positive and significant, as expected, the interaction terms (EO × dynamic environment (ED); EO × technology resources (TR)) were insignificant. Similarly, the interaction terms (EO × ED; EO × SN; EO × TR) on financial return performance were positive and significant, as expected, but only the interaction (EO × BT) was insignificant (p &gt; .05). The results indicate a consistency and stability of the signs of the interaction effects in both the comprehensive models (i.e., model 7 and model 14) and the models that contain the interaction effects separately, further supporting the notion of robustness (Covin et al., 2006). Furthermore, we examined the possibility of curvilinear effects of business and social networks in line with arguments that organizations with high business network ties benefit from possible cost reduction, economies of scale, effective targeting of marketing strategies and tactics which may smooth the progress of business success (Boso et al., 2013). A regression analyses was conducted incorporating the corresponding quadratic effects along with the two-way interaction effects. The results show that the curvilinear terms were insignificant, which increases our confidence that the proposed assumptions that the observed significant interaction terms strictly replicate the suggested theoretical moderating termsWhile the results indicate that the interaction terms (EO × business network tie (BT); EO × social network ties (SN)) on growth performance were positive and significant, as expected, the interaction terms (EO × dynamic environment (ED); EO × technology resources (TR)) were insignificant.

        <p>The research examined the role of a dynamic environment, networking and technology resources, on the relationship between EO and organizational performance. Utilizing the data gathered from Japanese hospitality firms, the findings clearly identified that in uncertain, dynamic environments, a higher level of risk and entrepreneurial orientation benefited business performance especially when coupled with strong business and social networks. The findings also suggest that smaller hospitality businesses have a higher EO as they are more inclined to innovation and risk-taking. Networking ties also have positive effect on growth. This research is timely for the hospitality industry because it developed and tested an empirical model for explaining the relationship between dynamic environment, networking, technology resources, entrepreneurial orientation and organizational performance. Previous research has examined only elements of these relationships (cf Ghantous &amp; Alnawas, 2020;Jogaratnam &amp; Tse, 2006;Kallmuenzer &amp; Peters, 2018;Majid et al., 2019;Rotondo &amp; Fadda, 2019;Teixeira et al., 2019).The research examined the role of a dynamic environment, networking and technology resources, on the relationship between EO and organizational performance.

        <p>Building on the data from Japanese hospitality firms, this research has made innovative contributions by extending the knowledge on EO in the hospitality industry in a number of ways.Building on the data from Japanese hospitality firms, this research has made innovative contributions by extending the knowledge on EO in the hospitality industry in a number of ways.</p>
        <p>First, the results of this research addresses the inconsistencies in the existing empirical investigations into EO and business performance by confirming that EO positively influences short term financial return and long term business growth in creating and building value for hospitality firms (Kallmuenzer et al. 2019) validating that the EO theory is relevant for the hospitality industry. Previous research in EO in hospitality (Oktavio et al., 2019;Vega-Vázquez et al., 2016) highlight that EO tend to display negative or insignificant influences on business performance. These findings are significant because they assert that if hospitality businesses experiment with alternative offers, are more creative, take risks and are receptive to exploring novel products and new customers, they are more likely to succeed. To improve the performance of their business and for the longevity of the industry (Roxas &amp; Chadee, 2013;Hernández-Perlines, 2016) growth-oriented hospitality firms should display higher levels of EO.First, the results of this research addresses the inconsistencies in the existing empirical investigations into EO and business performance by confirming that EO positively influences short term financial return and long term business growth in creating and building value for hospitality firms (Kallmuenzer et al. 2019) validating that the EO theory is relevant for the hospitality industry.

        <p>As hypothesized, the findings revealed that the effect of EO on business outcomes is enhanced when operating in a situation with strong business and social network ties. This finding is novel as there is little empirical research on the relationship between networking and EO (Jiang et al., 2018) and in hospitality there is also little literature on this topic despite the significance of collaboration for innovation of the industry (cf. Marasco et al., 2018). Business networking ties are significant in helping hospitality firms to understand intra-firm and inter-firm collaboration, the institutional contexts and the provision of timely and accurate business information. These networks can improve their financial performance by enabling smaller and independent businesses to compete more effectively (Rotondo &amp; Fadda, 2019) as networking ties along with information sharing, and communication is a key avenue of competitive advantage (Achrol &amp; Kotler, 1999;French et al., 2017;Strobl &amp; Kronenberg, 2015). Networking is also important for those hotels which are located on the periphery as this enables them to learn and develop new knowledge, and facilities lowering risk of dealing with change and pursuing new opportunities. The period of writing this paper coincided with the global pandemic of Covid-19 which has already had detrimental impacts on the hospitality industry. This positive relationship between business networking ties and financial performance indicates that furthering these collaborations can be an opportunity to wrestle such challenging situations (Brass et al. 2004;Rotondo &amp; Fadda, 2019). Thus, proactively networking is a benefit for hospitality businesses especially in changing times. These results are reminiscent of the notion of how interaction with external sources of knowledge and information (i.e. business network ties) can support tourism businesses process-related activities to find novel and effective solutions for their operations.As hypothesized, the findings revealed that the effect of EO on business outcomes is enhanced when operating in a situation with strong business and social network ties.

        <p>While the quantitative research does not confirm the direct impact of social networking on short and long term performance, the findings from our pilot qualitative work showed otherwise (see Appendix A). Respondents agreed that the social networking ties are important for the success of the business. Indeed, with the exception of some shortcomings (e.g., Lazzarotti &amp; Manzini, 2009), using socio-metric (i.e. social network) items measuring collaboration in the organization, the findings reinforce prior hospitality (Rotondo &amp; Fadda, 2019;Strobl &amp; Kronenberg, 2015;Teixeira et al., 2019) and marketing and management studies (Cambra-Fierro et al., 2011;Lechner et al., 2006) that social network ties facilitate organizations yield and enhance performance while developing their market and orientation.While the quantitative research does not confirm the direct impact of social networking on short and long term performance, the findings from our pilot qualitative work showed otherwise (see Appendix A).

        <p>Our findings deepen the existing research on EO in hospitality (Hernández-Perlines, 2016;Jogaratnam, 2017;Jogaratnam &amp; Tse, 2006;Kallmunzer and Peters, 2019;Vega-Vázquez et al., 2016;) and in management (Covin et al., 2006;Lumpkin &amp; Dess, 1996) by confirming that EO is a multidimensional concept. This finding is significant for hospitality businesses because it allows them to have a more strategic approach to resource distribution based on targeting where it is leads to business benefits rather than allocating to each of the dimensions of EO.Our findings deepen the existing research on EO in hospitality (Hernández-Perlines, 2016;Jogaratnam, 2017;Jogaratnam &amp; Tse, 2006;Kallmunzer and Peters, 2019;Vega-Vázquez et al., 2016;) and in management (Covin et al., 2006;Lumpkin &amp; Dess, 1996) by confirming that EO is a multidimensional concept. This finding is significant for hospitality businesses because it allows them to have a more strategic approach to resource distribution based on targeting where it is leads to business benefits rather than allocating to each of the dimensions of EO.</p>
        <p>Additionally, these results corroborate existing literature that EO must be understood from the contextual characteristics from which it is studied (Lumpkin &amp; Dess, 1996;Wales et al., 2019). This gap in knowledge is also noted in the hospitality literature (Fu et al., 2019;Njoroge et al., 2020). The positive relationship between EO and financial performance may be explained from the Japanese context and the critical importance of networking as part of their business culture. These earlier varying results were possible because it is assumed that the indicators of EO were developed for Western business contexts (Njoroge et al., 2020). Our findings are significant because it affirms that for researchers to provide a developed understanding of EO in the hospitality industry, that the context must be considered as EO may vary based on this. The findings also revealed that the more dynamic the environment the better the return from an EO and smaller hospitality firms are more likely to be entrepreneurial and less risk adverse to larger firms, business networks are highly prevalent in the tourism industry and social networks help the organization when it is growing fast. In hospitality, risks are always present (Williams &amp; Baláž, 2014). Given the dominance of small businesses in hospitality, the findings are significant in encouraging small businesses to be less risk adverse for improved performance. In hospitality, a higher risk tolerance leads to better outcomes for SMEs (Martinez-Roman, 2015) and leads to better performance in a dynamic environment (Kreiser &amp; David, 2012). These outcomes are noteworthy given that previous results on small businesses in tourism resulted in inconsistent returns on risk taking did not find an inclination for risk taking (Kallmunzer &amp; Peters, 2018;Memiliet al., 2010). This higher level of risk inclination may be explained by the dynamism of the environment within which these Japanese firms are operating in as Miller and Friesen (1983) indicated that the level of risk is environment dependent. Lastly, our empirical results suggest that the various technological resources by their possible effect on operational processes and strategy development have increased the opportunities for entrepreneurial firms to expand their revenues and short term financial gains, but they are inadequate for attaining success in the long term. A plausible reason is that technological resources are valuable, yet they might be substitutable or duplicable over the course of time (cf. Cohen &amp; Olsen, 2013;Hadjimanolis &amp; Dickson, 2001). Some of these technology resources require a specific level of financial stability to execute within organizations. Entrepreneurial firms with scarce financial resources can harness some technology resources by employing the technologies that are inexpensively available, but they are useful for temporary competitive advantage over rivals (cf. Ray et al., 2004).Additionally, these results corroborate existing literature that EO must be understood from the contextual characteristics from which it is studied (Lumpkin &amp; Dess, 1996;Wales et al., 2019).

        <p>Over and above the theoretical contributions, this study has fundamental managerial implications for tourism companies. As predicted in this research, the impact of EO is dependent on the level of environmental dynamism: the more dynamic the environment the better the return from EO. This infers that these hotels should understand their business environment to improve their performance. However, not all of the businesses have the knowledge and/or capabilities for this to be realized. Here, local hotel associations or government bodies can play a role by providing training and policies to encourage innovation and growth in dynamic environments. For example, in highly dynamic environments, hotels may need more access to financial resources to support them in being more innovative and taking risks.Over and above the theoretical contributions, this study has fundamental managerial implications for tourism companies.

        <p>In conclusion, the moderating impact of networking ties on the connection between EO and organizational performance is supported in this research. Strong social and business networking is increase growth when aligned to an EO, and when the organization is growing fast then social networks really come into their own. Hence with EO, firms can leverage their financial return and growth through establishing strong network relationships. Managers can benefit from strong network ties to leverage intangible knowledge (e.g. domestic and overseas connections) and reduce the cost associated with search for potential buyers, suppliers and competitors. Indeed, entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial firms are not only interested to creating and developing new ventures, bearing more of the risks, but at the same time, they are concerned with the aspect of profit making opportunities. Through network ties and social interaction new ideas can emerge which pave the path to explore profitable opportunities which in particular benefit smaller firms. For hospitality businesses, this research provides empirical support for the importance of networking to manage their expectations.In conclusion, the moderating impact of networking ties on the connection between EO and organizational performance is supported in this research.

        <p>Hospitality managers are advised to consider forming partnership alliances, dynamic interactions and networking, both socially and in business communities, as connections may be utilized for mutual benefit and success. These notions suggest that to achieve a superior business performance, firms should detect possible valuable partnering opportunities, and pledge preventive activities in response. Investing in enhanced technology will not bring firms these types of returns.Hospitality managers are advised to consider forming partnership alliances, dynamic interactions and networking, both socially and in business communities, as connections may be utilized for mutual benefit and success.

        <p>Finally, it is vital to state that academics and practitioners should be careful when generalizing the results to various cultural environments. This research was underpinned in a particular environment of hospitality firms in Japan. Nonetheless, the function of dynamism and networks is pertinent to other industries. Moreover, in this explication, performance was evaluated by growth and financial returns, while there is evidence that performance is multidimensional. Fu et al. (2019) suggested that entrepreneurial research in hospitality and tourism should fuse both qualitative and quantitative research methods to provide richer insights.Finally, it is vital to state that academics and practitioners should be careful when generalizing the results to various cultural environments.

        <p>Throughout the discussion, we have attempted to show the complementarities or contradictories between theory and practice in tourism service businesses. A subsequent quantitative approach was adopted to collect and analyze data to establish credibility in the field. Future research might utilize objective measurement scales for organizational performance to fortify the study design. Another possibility of future study would be to examine the appropriate levels of strong networking ties required for a firm's success. Luu and Ngo (2018) have reported that strong business ties in collectivist cultures can limit a firm's EO. However, their research is underdeveloped on what the appropriate levels of networking ties are. Additional research might scrutinize the impact of international business networks on business performance. Since our measures of EO, dynamism, two network-ties constructs, financial return and growth are from self-reports, there would obviate the concern that some of our findings may be affected by measurement error or discrepancies in the level of measurement (Tellis et al., 2009). Using a longitudinal study and incorporating more variables may advance our understanding of the direction of causality between variables.Throughout the discussion, we have attempted to show the complementarities or contradictories between theory and practice in tourism service businesses.
