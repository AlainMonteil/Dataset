        <p>In this paper, we propose a novel approach to examine the risk spillovers between FinTech firms and traditional financial institutions, during a time of fast technological advances. Based on the stock returns of U.S. financial and FinTech institutions, we estimate pairwise risk spillovers by using the Granger causality test across quantiles. We consider the whole distribution: the left tail (bearish case), the right tail (bullish case) and the center of the distribution and construct three types of spillover networks (downside-to-downside, upside-toupside, and center-to-center) and obtain network-based spillover indicators. We find that linkages in the network are stronger in the bearish case when the risk of spillover is higher.In this paper, we propose a novel approach to examine the risk spillovers between FinTech firms and traditional financial institutions, during a time of fast technological advances.

        <p>FinTech institutions' risk spillover to financial institutions positively correlates with financial institutions' increase in systemic risk. These results have important policy implications, as they underscore the importance of enhancing the supervision and regulation of FinTech companies, to maintain financial stability.FinTech institutions' risk spillover to financial institutions positively correlates with financial institutions' increase in systemic risk.

        <p>In recent years, financial technology (henceforth FinTech) has developed rapidly and innovative firms leveraging new technologies are playing an increasingly important role in the financial system. According to the Financial Stability Board (2017), FinTech can be defined as "technologically-enabled financial innovation that could result in new business models, applications, processes or products with an associated material effect on financial markets and institutions and the provision of financial services." The usage of technology in providing financial services is the key to FinTech (Thakor, 2019).In recent years, financial technology (henceforth FinTech) has developed rapidly and innovative firms leveraging new technologies are playing an increasingly important role in the financial system.

        <p>As new entrants, FinTech players are intrinsically linked to traditional financial institutions for the following three main reasons: (i) they compete in similar market segments and in similar businesses (Dorfleitner et al., 2017;Yao et al., 2018;Kommel et al., 2018); (ii) they cooperate closely (Romﾄ］ova and Kudinska, 2017); and (iii) there is increasing investment from traditional financial institutions into FinTech companies (Lee and Shin, 2018). As a result of these multiple interconnections, the risks inherent to the FinTech institutions could spillover to traditional financial institutions, possibly causing systemic risk (Financial Stability Board, 2017;He et al., 2017).As new entrants, FinTech players are intrinsically linked to traditional financial institutions for the following three main reasons: (i) they compete in similar market segments and in similar businesses (Dorfleitner et al., 2017;Yao et al., 2018;Kommel et al., 2018); (ii) they cooperate closely (Romﾄ］ova and Kudinska, 2017); and (iii) there is increasing investment from traditional financial institutions into FinTech companies (Lee and Shin, 2018).

        <p>In this paper, we propose a novel framework to examine the risk spillovers between FinTech firms and traditional financial institutions, during a time of fast technological advances and important changes in the business models of traditional financial institutions. The understanding of risk spillovers in the financial system is critical to the understanding of systemic risk and crucial to maintaining financial stability. While there is an extensive body of literature which has focused on the understanding of systemic risk and risk spillovers in the aftermath of the global financial crisis (see e.g. Billio et al., 2012;Chau and Deesomsak, 2014;Choudhry and Jayasekera, 2014;Diebold and Yilmaz, 2014;Yao et al., 2017;Shahzad et al., 2017;Sun et al., 2019;Zhu et al., 2019), the extant literature related to FinTech is still at an early stage.In this paper, we propose a novel framework to examine the risk spillovers between FinTech firms and traditional financial institutions, during a time of fast technological advances and important changes in the business models of traditional financial institutions.

        <p>A number of studies investigate the relationship between FinTech, and traditional financial institutions based on qualitative analysis. Romﾄ］ova and Kudinska (2017) identify the risks of banks facing the emergence of FinTech through analyzing recent development trends in banking and FinTech. Lee and Shin (2018) discuss the advantages of FinTech in providing financial services and the challenges for traditional financial institutions. In a qualitative setting, Ng and Kwok (2017), Drashch et al. (2018) and Anagnostopoulos (2018) acknowledge that the traditional financial sector faces new risks connected with the emergence of innovative FinTech startups. Further, the Financial Stability Board (2017) suggests that FinTech activities could intensify risk contagion and assets volatility in the financial system, thereby undermining financial stability. These studies acknowledge the potential risks faced by traditional financial institutions or even the financial system, connected with the development of FinTech institutions, but they lack empirical evidence to support their views.A number of studies investigate the relationship between FinTech, and traditional financial institutions based on qualitative analysis.

        <p>There is also an emerging strand of the empirical literature that studies the relationship between FinTech firms and traditional financial institutions. Based on a Vector Auto-Regression (VAR) impulse response model, Yao et al. (2018) show a positive correlation between the innovation of third-party payments and the value creation capabilities of the traditional financial institutions in China. Zhang et al. (2017) utilize a bootstrap panel causality approach to demonstrate that causality between bank loans and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) loans varies across regions in China. Jagtiani and Lemieux (2018) provide evidence that FinTech lending penetrated areas that lack banking services in the U.S.There is also an emerging strand of the empirical literature that studies the relationship between FinTech firms and traditional financial institutions.

        <p>These studies, to some extent, demonstrate the close relations between the FinTech and traditional financial institutions based on empirical analysis. Nonetheless, there are gaps in the extant literature. First, most studies consider only the relationship between FinTech firms and a certain category of financial institutions offering similar products or services, with most studies focusing on banks. However, there are many other important categories of financial institutions, which have been mostly overlooked. Given the complex web of interconnections in the financial system, we argue that ignoring different types of financial institutions may lead to a biased understanding of risk spillovers. Although there is evidence in the literature that the relationship between different institutions vary in extreme cases compared to when they are experiencing normal trading patterns (see e.g. Balla et al., 2014;Candelon and Tokpavi, 2016), only a handful of existing studies has considered these different interactions.These studies, to some extent, demonstrate the close relations between the FinTech and traditional financial institutions based on empirical analysis.

        <p>The contributions of this paper to the literature are manifold. First, we examine the risk spillovers between FinTech institutions and several major types of traditional financial institutions, including banks, diversified financials, insurers, and real estate lenders. This allows us to build a more complete picture of risk spillovers in the financial industry and complements the extant literature which has mainly focused on banks. Second, we develop a novel approach that constructs different types of spillover networks to estimate the risk spillovers in distinct cases. We build upon the work of Balla et al. (2014) and Candelon and Tokpavi (2016) and we consider both extreme and normal cases in this approach. Specifically, we consider three cases, i.e. the left tail (a downturn or crisis period), the right tail (an upswing period) and the center of the distributions of the institutions' stock returns. We define the left tail as the bearish case, the right tail as the bullish case and the center as the normal case (excluding the two extreme cases).The contributions of this paper to the literature are manifold.

Next, we construct two network-based spillover indicators to estimate the risk spillovers within sectors, between sectors and within the whole system. Our empirical analysis is based on the stock returns of a sample of U.S financial institutions and Fintech firms from January 2011 to June 2018, a period of fast technological advances. We find that the risk spillovers between FinTech firms and traditional financial institutions vary in different cases and those in the bearish case are stronger.We then construct three types of spillover networks (downside-to-downside, upside-to-upside, and center-to-center) and estimate pairwise risk spillovers by using the Granger causality test across quantiles (Candelon and Tokpavi, 2016).

        <p>We then consider time-varying risk spillover risk, with a 500-day rolling window, and our results confirm that during downturns the risk spillover between FinTech firms and traditional financial institutions in higher. Finally, we examine the correlation and causality between the risk spillover from FinTech firms to traditional financial institutions and the systemic risk of traditional financial institutions. By doing so, we aim to shed some light on whether the risk spillover from FinTech firms to financial institutions can be a potential cause of systemic risk, measured by SRISK (Brownlees and Engle, 2016). We find that the risk spillover from FinTech firms to traditional financial institutions is positively correlated with the systemic risk of these financial institutions. These results have important policy implications, as they underscore the importance of enhancing the supervision and regulation of FinTech companies, given their potential contribution to systemic risk.We then consider time-varying risk spillover risk, with a 500-day rolling window, and our results confirm that during downturns the risk spillover between FinTech firms and traditional financial institutions in higher.

        <p>In this section, we present our proposed approach for the construction of three types of spillover networks, namely downside-to-downside, upside-to-upside, and center-to-center, to estimate the risk spillovers across institutions in the bearish, normal and bullish cases respectively. More specifically, our methodology is based on a two-step approach. First, we estimate the risk spillovers between pairwise institutions in the abovementioned three cases by utilizing the Granger causality test across quantiles of Candelon and Tokpavi (2016). Second, based on the estimated risk spillovers, we build the three types of spillover networks and derive the network-based spillover indicators.In this section, we present our proposed approach for the construction of three types of spillover networks, namely downside-to-downside, upside-to-upside, and center-to-center, to estimate the risk spillovers across institutions in the bearish, normal and bullish cases respectively.

        <p>The first step in our analysis is the estimation of the three types of risk spillovers between pairwise institutions by implementing the Granger causality across quantiles to their stock returns. As a multivariate extension of the Granger causality in risk (Hong et al., 2009), which is commonly utilized to estimate extreme risk spillover (see e.g. Wang et al., 2017;Li et al., 2019), the Granger causality across quantiles can identify the Granger causality in the entire distribution between two series. According to this method, the value at risk (VaR) for each institution should be estimated first. Then, the sets of event variables for each institution can be obtained through their VaRs for recording the risk information in the bullish, normal and bearish cases respectively. This will allow us to estimate the risk spillovers between pairwise institutions in the three cases.The first step in our analysis is the estimation of the three types of risk spillovers between pairwise institutions by implementing the Granger causality across quantiles to their stock returns.

        <p>Our empirical analysis focuses on the U.S market as a setting to study the risk spillovers between FinTech firms and traditional financial institutions. Our first step is to identify and categorize FinTech institutions and traditional financial firms. As this is a rapidly developing sector, there are different ways in which the literature has tried to categorize FinTech institutions (Consumers International, 2017;Thakor, 2019). An important issue for our analysis is the existence of some overlap between traditional financial institutions and FinTech firms. For example, some startups or non-financial institutions utilize technology to provide financial services to customers. Similarly, some traditional financial institutions use financial technology to enhance products and services to customers. These institutions are labeled as cross-business institutions in this paper.Our empirical analysis focuses on the U.S market as a setting to study the risk spillovers between FinTech firms and traditional financial institutions.

        <p>While there are many possible classifications (Wei et al 2019a;Wei et al 2019b), in this paper, we follow the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) and include the traditional financial industry four GICS sectors, namely banks (GICS code 4010), diversified financials (GICS code 4020), insurers (GICS code 4030) and real estate lenders (GICS code 4040 before 2016, and 6010 after 2016). Next, we select traditional financial institutions from the S&amp;P 500 index. There are 101 financial institutions in the S&amp;P 500 index. We then restrict the sample to include only to financial institutions that mainly engage in traditional financial services. This is important for our set-up, as some financial institutions also provide some innovative FinTech services and are therefore classified as cross-business.1While there are many possible classifications (Wei et al 2019a;Wei et al 2019b), in this paper, we follow the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) and include the traditional financial industry four GICS sectors, namely banks (GICS code 4010), diversified financials (GICS code 4020), insurers (GICS code 4030) and real estate lenders (GICS code 4040 before 2016, and 6010 after 2016).

        <p>In this section, we present the results of our empirical analysis.

        <p>In the first step in our empirical analysis, we estimate the risk spillover networks for all the institutions, banks, diversified financials, insurers, real estate lenders, FinTech and crossbusiness institutions, in the bearish, bullish and normal case. The risk spillovers are estimated by the Granger-causality across quantiles with the significance at the 5% level. The resultant networks are illustrated in Fig. 1. In each network, the nodes are the institutions, while the edges represent the risk spillover between the linked institutions. The institutions (nodes) in different sectors are distinguished by the color: green for banks, blue for diversified financials, yellow for insurers, light blue for real estate lenders, red for the FinTech institutions, and purple for the cross-business institutions. The risk spillover from each institution, i.e. the corresponding node's outgoing edge, is displayed by the same color as its sectors. From these networks, it can be observed that the linkages in the network in the bearish case (see Fig. respectively. These results indicate that the risk spillover across all the institutions is much stronger in the bearish case than the spillovers in the bullish and normal cases. Based on the estimated risk spillover networks, we can then analyze the risk spillover between the institutions in different sectors. We compute the directional spillover indices between six non-overlapping sectors, i.e., banking, diversified financials, insurance, real estate lenders, FinTech and cross-business, and the total spillover index for each sector. The results for the bearish, normal and bullish cases are respectively shown in Panel A, B, and C in Table 1. In each panel, the non-diagonal elements represent the values of the directional spillover indices between the pairwise sectors, while the diagonal numbers are the values of the total spillover indices for the sectors. From Table 1, it can be seen that the values of the spillover indices in the bearish case are all over 0.460 (see Panel A), while those in the normal or bullish case are all below 0.265 (see Panel B and C). This indicates that the values of the spillover indices in the bearish case are significantly larger than those in the normal and bullish cases. To check if the differences between the values of the spillover indices in the bearish case and those in the normal (or bullish) case are statistically significant, we use the well-known Wilcoxon signed-rank test (Wilcoxon, 1945), to examine the differences between the matched samples (see e.g. Davies and Kim, 2009;Cohen et al., 2012;Chen and Wang, 2012). The results of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicate that the differences are statistically significant at the 1% level. Overall, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test results demonstrate that the risk spillovers between the subsectors or within each subsector in the bearish case are larger compared to normal and bullish cases. This confirms the results of the total spillovers in the whole network (see Fig. 1). Thus, we can conclude that both considering the whole network or the between (within) subsectors, the risk spillover in the bearish case is generally stronger compared to the bullish and normal cases. In general, the results in Table 1 show that the risk spillovers from either the traditional financial firms or FinTech institutions are significant in the bearish case. However, there are still differences between the risk spillovers from different sectors. To evaluate whether these differences are statistically significant, we use the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for the pairwise spillovers. The results are shown in Table 2 and illustrate the p-value of the spillovers from each sector (from column to row and vice versa). For example, the spillovers from FinTech and banks are equal to 0.031. This indicates that the spillover effects from FinTech are lower than those from banks at the 5% significance level. In a similar way, we obtain the p-values of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for the spillovers of all the other pairwise sub-sectors. Looking at the results in Table 2, we can see that the spillover effects from FinTech institutions are lower than most of the traditional financial firms, including banks, diversified financials, crossbusiness institutions, but not significantly higher than those from insurers. Indeed, we find that the spillover effects from insurers are significantly lower than those from other financial firms (i.e. banks, diversified financials, and real estate lenders) and cross-business institutions at 5% or 10% level. These findings show that, in general, the higher risk spillovers are from the diversified financials and the lowest from insurers.In the first step in our empirical analysis, we estimate the risk spillover networks for all the institutions, banks, diversified financials, insurers, real estate lenders, FinTech and crossbusiness institutions, in the bearish, bullish and normal case.

        <p>This section analyzes the dynamic risk spillover between FinTech firms and traditional financial institutions by estimating the directional spillover indices in the three cases with a 500-day rolling time window. By doing so, we obtain the time-varying risk spillovers from December 28, 2012, to June 29, 2018. We then measure the dynamic risk spillovers between cross-business institutions and traditional financial firms during this period. These results are displayed in Fig. 2.This section analyzes the dynamic risk spillover between FinTech firms and traditional financial institutions by estimating the directional spillover indices in the three cases with a 500-day rolling time window.

        <p>We can see that the risk spillovers between the FinTech and traditional financial institutions in the bearish case are more volatile compared to those in the bullish and normal cases. To be more specific, in the bearish case, the risk spillovers in both directions peaked at a high level, over 0.62 (see Panel A of Fig. 2). This is potentially due to the destabilizing effects of the post-crisis economic cycle in the U.S. As the economy recovered, the risk spillover between FinTech firms and financial institutions significantly declined (from 0.62 to 0.26) after mid-2013. From the end of 2015 to mid-2016, we see a noticeable increase in the downside risk spillover from the FinTech to financial institutions. This might result from the steadfast growth of the U.S. the FinTech sector, spurred by the rapidly increasing investment in new technologies during this period ( KPMG International, 2019). By contrast, during the whole sample period, the risk spillovers of both directions in the normal case generally fluctuate at around 0.20, while the risk spillovers in the bullish case range within [0.11, 0.43] (see Panel B and C in Fig. 2).We can see that the risk spillovers between the FinTech and traditional financial institutions in the bearish case are more volatile compared to those in the bullish and normal cases.

        <p>Similar findings can be obtained from the results of the risk spillovers between cross-business and financial institutions. In sum, these findings reveal that the risk spillover in the bearish case is more volatile than that in the bullish and normal case.Similar findings can be obtained from the results of the risk spillovers between cross-business and financial institutions.

        <p>In addition, while the values of bi-directional risk spillovers between FinTech firms and financial institutions in the normal (or bullish) case are quite similar during the sample period, the bi-directional spillovers in the bearish case are substantially different during certain periods.In addition, while the values of bi-directional risk spillovers between FinTech firms and financial institutions in the normal (or bullish) case are quite similar during the sample period, the bi-directional spillovers in the bearish case are substantially different during certain periods.</p>
        <p>In particular, from the end of 2012 to the middle of 2013, the risk spillover from the traditional financial institutions to FinTech companies was larger than that in the opposite direction (see Panel A of Fig. 2). However, from the middle of 2015 to the end of 2017, the risk spillover from FinTech institutions to traditional financial firms was relatively more significant than the opposite directional risk spillover. Note that the results of the risk spillovers between the crossbusiness institutions and traditional financial institutions are generally similar to those between the FinTech firms and financial firms. These results demonstrate the asymmetry in the bi-directional risk spillovers between the FinTech (cross-business) firms and traditional financial institutions in the bearish case.In particular, from the end of 2012 to the middle of 2013, the risk spillover from the traditional financial institutions to FinTech companies was larger than that in the opposite direction (see Panel A of Fig. 2).

        <p>This subsection analyzes whether the risk spillovers from FinTech firms to traditional financial institutions contribute to an increase in the systemic risk contribution of the latter. We estimate the systemic risk of all the traditional financial institutions by employing the wellknown Brownlees and Engle (2016)'s SRISK measure, which essentially captures the capital shortfall of the institutions, conditional on a severe market decline. We focus on the risk spillover in the bearish case, because of its high volatility. In this part, we consider only the risk spillover from FinTech institutions and exclude cross-business institutions which provide both FinTech services and traditional financial services. This is because it is difficult to exclude the risk spillover to financial institutions resulting from their traditional financial services. We therefore consider the average SRISK of the 90 traditional financial institutions in our sample. It is interesting to find that the tendencies of these two measures are similar. This indicates that there might be a positive relationship between the risk spillover from FinTech to financial institutions and the systemic risk contribution of financial institutions. We then examine this relationship by utilizing two commonly-used statistical methods, the Pearson correlation test and the Granger causality test. The Pearson correlation test is implemented to test whether the risk spillover from FinTech institutions is positively correlated with the systemic risk of traditional financial firms. The Granger causality test is employed to study if the risk spillover from FinTech institutions could cause systemic risk and vice versa. These tests are estimated for not only the whole traditional financial sector but also the different sub-sectors (banks, diversified financials, insurers, and real estate lenders). The summary statistics of all these measures are displayed in Table 3. Based on the above results we show that the risk spillover from FinTech firms to traditional financial institutions is positively correlated with the systemic risk of traditional financial institutions. In addition, when considering the causality between the two measures, we show that the risk spillover from FinTech to traditional financial institutions could cause the systemic risk of the traditional financial institutions, but not vice versa. These results provide empirical evidence that the spillover from FinTech could affect traditional financial institutions' systemic risk. These results have important policy implications and suggest that closer monitoring of the risk spillover from FinTech institutions to traditional financial firms is necessary for maintaining financial stability.This subsection analyzes whether the risk spillovers from FinTech firms to traditional financial institutions contribute to an increase in the systemic risk contribution of the latter.

        <p>This study analyzes the risk spillovers between FinTech firms and several major types of traditional financial institutions, including banks, diversified financials, insurers, and real estate lenders, during a period of fast technological advances. By considering several different types of financial institutions, we provide a fuller picture of the complex interactions in the financial system and show how the emergence of new players impacts on risk spillovers. In addition, we provide an approach that constructs three types of spillover networks (downside-to-downside, center-to-center, and upside-to-upside) to study the risk spillovers. Using the stock returns of the institutions, we estimate pairwise risk spillovers by employing the Granger causality test across quantiles. This approach allows us to contribute to the literature by comprehensively examining the risk spillovers in multiple cases. In our empirical analysis, based on the stock returns of U.S. financial institutions and FinTech firms, we that the risk spillovers between FinTech and traditional financial institutions are indeed different in the tails compared to the center of the distribution. In particular, we provide evidence of stronger spillovers during periods of downturn. Both the risk spillovers between FinTech and traditional financial sectors or those within sectors in the bearish case are the strongest. We also provide evidence that the risk spillover from the FinTech to traditional financial institutions has a positive relationship with, and even could be a potential cause of, the systemic risk of traditional financial institutions.This study analyzes the risk spillovers between FinTech firms and several major types of traditional financial institutions, including banks, diversified financials, insurers, and real estate lenders, during a period of fast technological advances.
