        <p>Customer relationship management (CRM) has become the lifeblood of banking and the principal driver of sustainable marketing performance in the digital economy. The discovery of computers and the Internet has transformed the industrial economy into digital through the integration of CRM and related elements, resulting in several benefits, including growth in research documents and increased collaborations. Marketers have developed a CRM system that integrates the digital infrastructure and digital capabilities of people to promote the sustainable marketing performance of banks through innovations such as customer acquisition, segmentation, customization, loyalty, and profitability. The paper aims to analyse the scientific landscape of CRM and sustainable marketing performance in the digital economy. The authors resorted to the Scopus database to extract 1485 documents and filtered 248 for Scopus analysis and to determine the roles of CRM. The filtered documents were then exported to 
            <rs type="software">VOSviewer</rs> for visualization mapping, including co-authorship and co-occurrence analysis. The visualization mapping depicts relationships among the keywords. The results of the research indicate an upwards growth in research publications since 2003, growing interest in funding and collaborations by countries and institutions, and the relationship among the keywords. The emerging financial crisis is a motivation for research in the area of study. The results also indicate that the integration of CRM into digital technology promotes collaborations and innovations resulting in the development of banking software applications to promote customer acquisition, retention, loyalty, profitability and sustainability. The study developed an integrated framework for sustainable banking performance. Global crises, including financial crises and COVID-19, have increased research output and become an integral part of CRM. Green banking is to be researched and integrated. The study will be used as a basis for further studies and for bankers for policy formulation.

        <p>Effective CRM implementation enables businesses to improve customer relationships and loyalty as well as maximize revenue and minimize costs. According to Blery &amp; Michalakopoulos [1], CRM is one of the best approaches to sustaining the long-term performance of banks. Thus, CRM has become the lifeblood of banking and the principal driver of sustainable performance in marketing efficiency in the digital economy due to the important roles it plays. Any system that determines customer activity can measure business value. The new technology resulting in mass production and economies of scale has the potential to minimize costs and maximize profits [2].Effective CRM implementation enables businesses to improve customer relationships and loyalty as well as maximize revenue and minimize costs.

        <p>During the industrial revolution, companies focused on making huge profits through economies of scale at the expense of customer satisfaction. However, CRM has become a significant determinant of organizational performance and sustainability in the digital economy. Society has not been static but dynamic, changing from simpler to complex and traditional to modern and global, so businesses need to be innovative to perform. Companies integrate relational customer indicators into profitability measurement to determine performance. Businesses, including banks, adopt the customer-centric approach to reaching their goals and objectives through holistic marketing. The holistic marketing concept encompasses relational marketing, integrated marketing, internal marketing, as well as corporate social responsibility marketing which enhances banking trust and image [3]. This suggests that in this study, integrating profitability and customer relational indicators is a holistic approach to sustainable performance in the banking industry.During the industrial revolution, companies focused on making huge profits through economies of scale at the expense of customer satisfaction.

        <p>Customer patronage is the outcome of a great manufacturing capability [4]. CRM is a technology that synchronizes organizational activities (e.g. segmentation, targeting, product development, sales, marketing research, business environment, analytics and green banking) and makes customer relations automatic by focusing on acquisition, retention and profitability [5]. In the contemporary digital economy, information technology capability is the fundamental sustainability factor for firms [6][7][8][9][10][11][12]. In the virtual market, companies need to put IT infrastructure tools and systems in place and have employees capable of using IT tools for accessing, integrating, evaluating and creating information and connecting stakeholders to promote sustainable marketing performance [13][14][15][16]. The availability of information tools alone does not guarantee development and the ability to solve problems [17]. Apart from investing in digital infrastructure, the organization needs to build capacity through training and integrate IT into business operations to realize the full effect. Besides, it is necessary to enhance relevant digital knowledge and skills [18][19][20][21][22].Customer patronage is the outcome of a great manufacturing capability [4].

        <p>Earlier researchers have not studied CRM, digitalization, and performance together to establish the relationships among them. Studies about CRM and technology indicate that technology is a CRM enabler; it promotes customer relationships by centralizing data and information as well as providing accurate and timely information [23]. Most CRM and technology studies to determine the role technology plays in CRM indicate the statistical relationship between technology and CRM [24].Earlier researchers have not studied CRM, digitalization, and performance together to establish the relationships among them.

        <p>Additionally, several studies on CRM and aspects of technology aimed at evaluating the contribution of technology to effective CRM have shown that CRM implementation largely depends on the state of technology and that technology and CRM are statistically related [23]. Technology and CRM contribute to the sustainable marketing performance of organizations. Despite a wider adoption of the CAMELs model, namely, Capital adequacy, Asset quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity, and Sensitivity to market risk [24] for assessing banking performance, many organizations have gone out of business, while others find it challenging to sustain their performance, particularly in the digital age.Additionally, several studies on CRM and aspects of technology aimed at evaluating the contribution of technology to effective CRM have shown that CRM implementation largely depends on the state of technology and that technology and CRM are statistically related [23].

        <p>The 2007-2008 financial crisis in the United States resulted in a high rate of bank failures [25]. As a result, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation closed 465 banks from 2008-2012. Bank of Ghana's (BOG) Stability report for 2017 stated that the banking industry's cost-income ratio increased to 85.7% in February 2017 from 84.4% in February 2016, indicating a general decline in the banking industry's efficiency. The Ghana banking crisis between August 2017 and January 2020 affected many banks, and the BOG allowed some indigenous banks to take over private companies. Dwamena et al. [26] noted that the recent banking crisis in Ghana has led to the revocation of the licences of more than 400 financial institutions that were licenced under the Act, 2016 (Act 930).The 2007-2008 financial crisis in the United States resulted in a high rate of bank failures [25].

        <p>Comparatively, the Ukrainian banking crisis was between 2014 and 2017, and out of the 181 banks as of January 2014, only 77 survived in May 2019 [27]. Often, crises demand transformational solutions, and in this regard, companies integrate industrial and digital era models to ensure their survival; hence, this research focuses on marketing innovations. Adam et al. [28] asserted that if firms are to continue in business, they must be innovative and adapt to new situations continually. Developing an integrated model with customer relational components promotes the banking industry's sustainable performance.Comparatively, the Ukrainian banking crisis was between 2014 and 2017, and out of the 181 banks as of January 2014, only 77 survived in May 2019 [27].

        <p>The CAMELS model is a partial method of assessing banking performance in the digital age since it focuses on financials and pays little attention to sustainable non-financial marketing elements, which is the gap the research addressed. Bibliometric co-occurrence mapping was used to identify sustainable marketing performance indicators, including customer relationship management, market share, customer loyalty, customer profitability, research and product development, service quality, green banking, and brand image integrated into financial measurements. This research, therefore, assessed the role of CRM and banks' marketing performance in the digital economy and offered sustainable marketing performance indicators as integral components, the proper and fit method that focuses on the customer. Practically, the study serves as a guide to regulators, including central banks and businesses, to formulate the right policies and performance measurements to promote sustainable performance. The research contributes to the growing theoretical development by developing an integrated and holistic model for measuring sustainable marketing performance in the banking sector. Academically, the study keeps researchers abreast with contemporary research trends for further studies.The CAMELS model is a partial method of assessing banking performance in the digital age since it focuses on financials and pays little attention to sustainable non-financial marketing elements, which is the gap the research addressed.

        <p>CRM evolved around the late 1950s with the introduction of Rolodex. In the 1960s, the main frame computers became available to businesses, the 1980s was an evolution of database marketing, in the 1990s software service was developed, the 2000s was the growth of cloudbased CRM and open-source software, in 2010 were the explosion of technology and rise of CRM providers and today further sophistication of CRM, building customer strategy [29]. Chen &amp; Popovich [30] asserted that CRM integrates people, processes and technology to analyse customers, manage relationships, and ensure customer retention. The authors added that CRM gas revolutionises from information technology, changes in organization, and customeroriented processes; hence, the successful implementation of CRM results in long-term customer profitability and loyalty. In this regard, CRM is becoming the lifeblood of contemporary and future businesses as cloud-based software solutions are gaining ground. Sales, marketing, service and provision of mobility are the main focus of CRM today.CRM evolved around the late 1950s with the introduction of Rolodex.

        <p>Banks need to adopt a holistic approach, financial and non-financial, to ensure the sustainability of the digital age. Raut et al. [31] studied the sustainability of banking from four angles, including CRM, business process, financial stability, and friendly environment management system. The emergence of CRM has promoted targeted and segmented marketing to enhance policy optimization and profit maximization. CRM is a complete strategy to acquire, retain and connect specific clients and create customer delight value. It includes sales, customer service, marketing and the supply chain that promote effectiveness and efficiency [32].Banks need to adopt a holistic approach, financial and non-financial, to ensure the sustainability of the digital age.

        <p>The purpose of CRM is defined to enhance productivity through marketing efficiency and effectiveness [33]. Scholars [32] have stated that cooperation and collaboration accruing from marketing efficiency minimize the transaction and cost of development. In banking, the digitalization process promotes efficient and quality service to customers. From a marketing perspective, digital banking promotes long-term quality service in banking and customer satisfaction [34]. CRM, which is the impact factor in the digital economy, integrates digitalization, banking, marketing, customers and other contemporary elements as a model to develop loyal customers for long-term sustainability.

        <p>The research theories in the later part of the 1970s focused on industrial marketing and channels to develop buyer-seller relationships [35]. The emergence of a marketing philosophy for customer-organization relationships resulted in CRM [36]. CRM is an integrative strategic process to develop, enhance and sustain customer relationships as well as add value to businesses [37]. In strategic management, the balanced scorecard encompassing financial, customer-oriented, internal business processes, and learning and growth is a holistic approach. CRM is a collaboration of all the departments in the bank [38]. Hoseini et al. [39] researched CRM and business performance and developed a conceptual framework based on a balance score card, and the results indicated a relationship between CRM processes and banking performance. Banking is a customer-based service because the customer is the highest priority [36]. Zulkifli &amp; Tahir [36] conducted research, and the results indicated six CRM measurements, namely, customer acquisition, customer value evaluation and customer information process. This study integrated CRM into financial determinants as a holistic approach to the sustainable marketing performance of banks.The research theories in the later part of the 1970s focused on industrial marketing and channels to develop buyer-seller relationships [35].

        <p>The CRM role in sustainable marketing performance in the contemporary digital economy was assessed holistically, including the impact on productivity trends, collaboration, funding, and integration. First, CRM contributes to publication output from 2003 to 2023, and this is analysed in comparative terms for the pre-and post-digitalization periods (Figure 2). Before 2003 represents pre-digitalization when banks had not integrated digital technology into banking and research output was zero. After digitalization in 2003, banks could use digital network infrastructure to connect stakeholders, including customers, shareholders, and regulators; therefore, CRM is an enabler of the digital economy and a promoter of the sustainable marketing performance of banks. The growing research has also resulted in banking innovations, including the Internet banking, ATMs, branchless banking, and the development of new banking application software to manage customers, products and transactions. At the same time, CRM innovations and digital integration resulted in the network, high operational cost, software/hardware and cybersecurity challenges, including internet fraud and hacking. The results show no research in 2007 that marks the beginning of the banking crisis and which might have interested researchers to take keen interest to intensify research in 2008, with 9 research documents being the highest since the predigital and digital era. This implies that crisis is an important motivation for research.The CRM role in sustainable marketing performance in the contemporary digital economy was assessed holistically, including the impact on productivity trends, collaboration, funding, and integration.

        <p>The graph in Figure 3 indicates the country contribution of the top countries in the research area of CRM on sustainable marketing performance in the digital economy. The results revealed a total of 189 research documents produced with an average of 18.9 per country. There is an increase in business and private funding to support art organizations in the United Kingdom to enable them to stay in business with integrity [55]. The United Kingdom and the United States promote research funding in business, including CRM. The results further revealed that no African country was among the top countries that contributed to the research in the study area. This suggests that countries in Africa have not shown much interest in CRM and sustainable marketing performance in the digital economy or have limited access to research funding, thereby resulting in low innovations in the banking sector and creating a digital divide challenge.The graph in Figure 3 indicates the country contribution of the top countries in the research area of CRM on sustainable marketing performance in the digital economy.

        <p>The outcome of the 
            <rs type="software">VOSviewer</rs> visualization itemized mapping depicts significant information, as each of the clusters is linked to the CRM cluster (Figure 11). This confirms that CRM plays an important role as the lifeblood or an engine that enables machines or systems to work. Each of the clusters, namely, information technology, electronic commerce, marketing, etc., is associated with other important keywords, all of which work together as a team or collaborate to work for a holistic result, similar to parts of a vehicle or human body work. The violet cluster includes keywords such as information technology, dynamic capabilities, sustainability, innovation process, balanced scorecard, and marketing orientation. A balanced scorecard includes finance, marketing, process, and human resources and is a holistic strategic approach to achieving sustainable results or goals.

        <p>Additionally, information technology or digital infrastructure alone cannot work to achieve results unless humans are trained and CRM systems and elements are synchronized to develop dynamic capabilities for the innovation process. In research on customer loyalty in bank services by Dubina et al. [55]. The researchers analysed the correlation between consumer loyalty and gender age. Shetch et al. [32] revealed that CRM and marketing efficiency are the outcomes of transaction and development cost minimization through collaborative processes.Additionally, information technology or digital infrastructure alone cannot work to achieve results unless humans are trained and CRM systems and elements are synchronized to develop dynamic capabilities for the innovation process.

        <p>Therefore, in this study, the red cluster includes keywords such as customer satisfaction, customer loyalty, banking industry, marketing, data mining, relationship management, advertising and customer experience, which all relate to CRM and achieve results.Therefore, in this study, the red cluster includes keywords such as customer satisfaction, customer loyalty, banking industry, marketing, data mining, relationship management, advertising and customer experience, which all relate to CRM and achieve results.</p>
        <p>Dubina et al. [55], in research on customer loyalty to bank services, noted that the COVID-19 crisis was a wake-up call to stabilize financial institutions. Among the red cluster is COVID-19, which has affected the way business is done and has therefore become an integral part of CRM and contemporary business systems. Shetch et al. [32] noted that CRM marketing efficiency is achieved through cooperative and collaborative processes that help to reduce transaction and development costs. In this study, the elements in the green cluster, including enterprise systems, machine learning, electronic commerce, risk assessment, customer trust, etc., also constitute integral parts of CRM and collaboratively play a holistic role in sustainable marketing performance in the digital economy. The results suggest that the integrated elements of CRM have been a transformation factor from an industrial to a digital economy, eliminating brick-and-mortar boundaries and unnecessary bureaucracy and promoting 24/7 business around the globe.Dubina et al.

        <p>Nigamananda [58] researched sustainable green banking and noted that profit maximization and business prospects are the results of innovative and environmentally sustainable business practices. Although VOSviewer mapping did not highlight green banking, it is an important sustainable performance factor. The benefits of green banking include cost savings, risk minimization, banks' reputational enhancement, and environmental sustainability promotion. Therefore, it plays both commercial and social responsibility roles. In this regard, the green banking element needs to be researched and integrated into CRM and sustainable banking in the digital economy.Nigamananda [58] researched sustainable green banking and noted that profit maximization and business prospects are the results of innovative and environmentally sustainable business practices.

        <p>The authors resorted to the Scopus database to extract 1485 documents and filtered 248 for Scopus analysis and to determine the roles of CRM. The results of the study indicate a growing interest in sponsorship and funding with the National Science Foundation leading to promoting the growth and sustainability of marketing performance in the digital economy. There is an upwards growth in research documents between 2003 and 2023 that leads to innovations and increased collaborations among countries, and the United Kingdom collaborates the most. The emerging financial crisis is a motivation for research in the area of study. The results also indicate that CRM promotes digitalization while digitalization enhances CRM, hence a reciprocal relationship and together promotes sustainable marketing performance in the digital economy. The researchers developed an integrated theoretical framework to include nonfinancial sustainability factors of CRM, namely, customer acquisition, retention, loyalty, and satisfaction, as an integral part of financial performance indicators to ensure a holistic assessment approach to banking performance. The transformation from an industrial to a digital economy requires a proper and fit approach to assess banking performance and possibly to ensure sustainability. The integrated theoretical model is recommended for future studies by researchers.The authors resorted to the Scopus database to extract 1485 documents and filtered 248 for Scopus analysis and to determine the roles of CRM.

        <p>COVID-19, which has affected the way business is done and has therefore become an integral part of CRM and contemporary business systems, is an outcome of the study, as indicated in the figure, among the red cluster. The increasing growth but fluctuation results from the research are due to the world crisis, including the financial crisis and COVID-19. A crisis is a motivation for research to diagnose the causes and find solutions. Technological innovations such as computers and the internet are also a motivation for research fluctuations within the period of 2003 to 2023. The year 2010 was the explosion of technology and the rise of CRM providers and today further sophistication of CRM, building customer strategy [29].COVID-19, which has affected the way business is done and has therefore become an integral part of CRM and contemporary business systems, is an outcome of the study, as indicated in the figure, among the red cluster.

        <p>Although bibliometric methods facilitate a review of volumes of research documents, they have some limitations, including language selection and the influence of citations on research outcomes. Green banking is a researchable factor integrated into the CRM system and is recommended for future research, although it is not highlighted in the VOSviewer bibliometric mapping. The study will be used as a basis for further research and for the government and bankers to shape the policy.Although bibliometric methods facilitate a review of volumes of research documents, they have some limitations, including language selection and the influence of citations on research outcomes.

        <p>The growth rate of annual research publications has been increasing over the past fifty years; hence, some countries and institutions are adopting the bibliometric method to perform reviews [59]. However, there are some limitations to bibliometric research. The fact that a paper has more citations may not necessarily mean it is more influential because citations are based on different reasons, including methodology assessment and checking for flaws. Whether citations are influential depends on the purpose of their use. Belter [59] stated that most cited papers tend to be very influential to authors for further research, and the usefulness of the papers requires some probing. An open-access paper may have more citations than restricted documents since most researchers with funding challenges, especially in developing countries, cannot access them, thereby affecting research outcomes. The database selection was limited to Scopus and other relevant data from other sources were excluded. This can be improved by analysing data from other reliable sources.The growth rate of annual research publications has been increasing over the past fifty years; hence, some countries and institutions are adopting the bibliometric method to perform reviews [59].

            <rs type="software">VOSviewer</rs> did not select the most relevant keywords that might influence the outcome of the research. This could be resolved by manually selecting the most relevant keywords for 
            <rs type="software">VOSviewer</rs> mapping analysis. The research was limited to English documents because metadata are in the English language. There may be some useful other languages but excluded and affecting the accuracy of the research outcome. This could be addressed by integrating automatic translators into various software, including 
            <rs type="software">Scopus</rs> and 
            <rs type="software">Web of Science</rs> systems.
