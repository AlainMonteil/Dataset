        <p>The dark side of customer behavior has been receiving increasing attention in the business and management literature in recent years. Scholars have used various terminologies to study those customer behaviors that disrupt service delivery, affect organizational performance, and impact on employees' well-being. In this study, through a systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis of 246 academic articles, we identify three clusters within the dark side of customer behavior literature: (1) customer dysfunctional behavior; (2) customer revenge and rage as forms of customer misbehavior; and (3) customer mistreatment and incivility-related clusters. Based on these three identified clusters of the literature, we propose an integrative framework of customer incivility as customer incivility is the current centerpiece of the literature on the dark side of customer behavior. In doing so, we identify various research gaps and suggest effective avenues for future works in this research stream.</p>
        <p>In a customer-centric approach, serving customers and consumers effectively remains the cornerstone of successful business outcomes such as high firm performance, stronger brand value, and customer loyalty (Gupta &amp; Ramachandran, 2021). Nevertheless, this shift towards customer-centricity also brought along detrimental customer behaviors. Hence, nowadays firms seek to understand how to deal with an increasing number of negative behaviors from customers as these negatively affect business outcomes as well as employees' performance and psychological well-being (Hur et al., 2015;Yagil, 2017).</p>
        <p>In this paper, we refer to these negative behaviors by using an umbrella term, the dark side of customer behavior, inspired by the dyadic relationship that exists between the "light" and the "dark" side of the Force in George Lucas' creation Star Wars, and that is also represented in Western and Eastern philosophical and religious worldviews (Eberl, 2016) as well as in management literature (a couple of examples are the work of Davenport et al., 2007;Heidenreich et al., 2015 that conceptualized dark sides of different management processes and outcomes).</p>
        <p>The dark side of customer behavior is an umbrella term for various concepts that scholars in consumer research and organizational research have used to define negative behaviors of consumers and customers. For example, Lovelock (2001) coined the term jay-customers for those customers who act inconsiderately, in a vulgar manner, and cause problems for the organization, other customers, and employees. The term dysfunctional customers is also used when investigating the behaviors of those individuals who deliberately or unintentionally, overtly or covertly disrupt the otherwise functional service delivery process (Fullerton &amp; Punj, 2004;Harris &amp; Reynolds, 2003). Other scholars coined the terms customer revenge and retaliation (e.g. Funches et al., 2009;Grégoire et al., 2010), which are seen as the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral efforts of customers in redistributing justice and fairness, and in punishing a corporation for its wrongdoings.</p>
        <p>Both consumer behavior and organizational behavior scholars investigate rage and aggression as part of the behavioral manifestations of negative customer emotions and the impact of the aggression on the organization and its employees (e.g. Grandey et al., 2007;Grove et al., 2012;Patterson et al., 2016;Walker et al., 2017). Other dark side behaviors include customer unfriendliness (Albrecht et al., 2017), which can result from negative behaviors such as verbal transgressions (Grandey et al., 2007;Walsh, 2011) or the omission of positive behaviors such as greeting and thanking (Dudenhöffer &amp; Dormann, 2013;Sliter et al., 2010). The broader terms used to reflect this dark side are customer dysfunctional behavior (Daunt &amp; Harris, 2012;Henkel et al., 2017), customer misbehavior (Harris &amp; Daunt, 2013), customer deviant behavior (Dootson et al., 2016), and customer mistreatment (Hershcovis &amp; Bhatnagar, 2017). Finally, in organizational behavior and organizational psychology literature, the term customer incivility is employed (Cortina et al., 2001;Van Jaarsveld et al., 2010) to discuss the rude and condescending, yet mundane, behaviors of customers.</p>
        <p>Although this given list of terms that reflect some form of the dark side of customer behavior is not definite, it is evident that the existence of these concepts does not help with advancing the field to a higher level. Just the opposite, in fact, because the blurry boundaries among these various conceptualizations that reflect some form of the dark side of customer behavior have resulted in a lack of clarity in this field of literature. Indeed, scholars have been investing significant efforts to deepdive into specific concepts. Examples of such work include systematic literature reviews of customer incivility (Lee &amp; Kim, 2022), of customers behaving badly (Fisk et al., 2010), and of customer deviance (Fombelle et al., 2020). However, to the best of our knowledge, no systematic effort has been invested in understanding the broader area of the dark side of customer behavior, aimed at identifying the focal concept in this area. Identifying the overlaps among different concepts and their definitions should help in moving from a dispersing field to a more in-depth advancement of the area led by the focal concept.</p>
        <p>Thus, the aim of this paper is to synthesize the scholarly findings and to provide future research avenues on the dark side of customer behavior. In this context, the primary objective of this study is to perform a comprehensive, structured literature review of the dark side of customer behavior umbrella term that leads to the development of an integrative framework of the central concept. Second, through a systematic literature review (SLR) based on bibliometric analysis, knowledge gaps are identified and used for suggesting promising paths for future research. Finally, by mapping and consolidating the literature on the topic, our study stimulates valuable insights for managers and executives for future practical implementation.</p>
        <p>Structurally, we begin by discussing the applied SLR methodology and next provide a descriptive, bibliometric, and content analysis. We subsequently provide an integrative conceptual framework of the central concept of the dark side of customer behavior, namely the concept of customer incivility. Finally, this study provides future research avenues on the dark side of customer behavior.</p>
        <p>There are no universally accepted boundaries, nor is there a definitive list of terms that belong to the umbrella term dark side of customer behavior. Instead, scholars and practitioners have focused on different perspectives and concepts that included a variety of characteristics constituting the dark side of customer behavior. In order to collect a list of relevant terms we held discussions with six academics of different levels of seniority (starting from assistant professors to full professors) in relevant fields (i.e. marketing, services, consumer psychology, and reputation), and built a list of terms used in the literature that corresponds to the dark side of customer behavior. Table 1 provides a summary of the concepts and diverse conceptualizations identified within the umbrella term dark side of customer behavior, and is followed by a discussion of how these constructs have been utilized in the existing literature, namely in terms of theoretical frameworks applied.</p>
        <p>Research on customer incivility has been gaining momentum in the last decade (Fisk et al., 2010;Fombelle et al., 2020;Lee &amp; Kim, 2022).</p>
        <p>Customer incivility is defined as insensitive, disrespectful, or rude behavior with ambiguous intentions directed at another person that displays a lack of regard for that person (Cortina et al., 2001). While the term customer incivility emerged in the organizational behavior and organizational psychology bodies of literature (Cortina et al., 2001;Van Jaarsveld et al., 2010), nowadays the customer incivility term is widely used in other research areas, such as tourism and hospitality (Han et al., 2016). While most of the research has adopted a unidirectional perspective regarding the impact of customer incivility on an employee's sales performance and the triggering of withdrawal behaviors such as absenteeism and tardiness (e.g. Sliter et al., 2012), recent studies adopt an interactive perspective by viewing customer incivility as the result of the socially complex interactive process between the customer and service providers (Lee &amp; Kim, 2022). Hence, customer incivility is likely to be driven by the characteristics of customers, organizations, and service employees (Sliter &amp; Jones, 2016).</p>
        <p>Dysfunctional customer behavior may be defined as interpersonal customer behaviors which are perceived as illegitimate by the company and its employees (Gong et al., 2014). Dysfunctional customer behavior and other related terms, such as deviant customer behaviors and customer misbehavior, are used to capture acts where customers intentionally violate the acceptable norms of conduct (Fullerton &amp; Punj, 2004).</p>
        <p>Both dysfunctional customer behavior and customer deviance/ misbehavior can be directed toward the employees, the products and services, other customers, the firm's financially valuable assets, or the physical or electronic assets of an organization (Fullerton &amp; Punj, 2004). These forms of behavior can take either a covert or an overt form (Berry &amp; Seiders, 2008;Harris &amp; Reynolds, 2004). Customer misbehavior can have a detrimental impact on frontline employees' physiological and emotional well-being and can jeopardize employees' job attitudes as well as their cognitive evaluation of their workplace (Harris &amp; Daunt, 2013). Overt customer misbehavior can result in diminished satisfaction of other customers with the firm's service and can, at the same time, be contagious, as these acts implicitly destigmatize misbehavior and deviance for those witnessing others (Schaefers et al., 2016).</p>
        <p>Customer mistreatment is defined as the disrespectful and demeaning behaviors of customers, which are perceived as fairnessviolating by the employees (Skarlicki et al., 2008). In the marketing literature, customer mistreatment is defined as the low-quality treatment that employees receive from customers, which can range from ambiguous demands to verbal aggression, and may or may not have a clear intention to harm the target (Baranik et al., 2017;Hershcovis &amp; Bhatnagar, 2017). Customer mistreatment has a human target and is mostly directed toward the employees rather than the other customers of an organization. Customer mistreatment can have long-lasting consequences for the employees as it results in the emergence of cognitive rumination and enduring negative moods for them (Wang et al., 2011). Customer mistreatment also increases the likelihood of employees' sabotage behavior against the customers and the likelihood for provision of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral support by the witnessing customers toward an employee who falls victim to customer mistreatment (Hershcovis &amp; Bhatnagar, 2017).</p>
        <p>Customer revenge is an intense emotional state, requiring relief, based on the perception and motivation that one has been wronged, rather than on rational thought, undifferentiated anger, or retributive justice (Bechwati &amp; Morrin, 2003), while retaliation is the response to an injurious or offensive action (Grégoire et al., 2010). Both concepts reflect a customer's infliction of harm to a firm in response to perceived damage that the customer believes the firm has inflicted on them, their significant others, or other customers (Grégoire et al., 2010;Zourrig et al., 2009). In this definition, harming a firm means that customers seek revenge at an organizational level rather than mistreating an individual employee. Research has found that customers seek revenge after the firm has failed to keep its promises to deliver a service of adequate quality or to recover a service failure properly (Antonetti &amp; Maklan, 2017).</p>
        <p>Customer rage, as a multidimensional construct, is defined as those overt behaviors that customers direct toward the organization, its employees, or other customers because of experiencing rage emotions (Patterson et al., 2016). Customer rage can range from ferocity, fury, wrath, disgust, and contempt to scorn and resentment (Andreassen, 2001;McColl-Kennedy et al., 2009). Rage emotions are discussed in two main categories: rancorous rage emotions and retaliatory rage emotions (McColl-Kennedy et al., 2009). Customers' experience of rage emotions leads to behavioral manifestations such as verbal, non-verbal, physical, or displaced rage behaviors (Grove et al., 2012;Patterson et al., 2016).</p>
        <p>In a direct verbal expression of rage, customers yell, swear, and insult the service employees. In a direct physical expression of rage, customers threaten to physically harm service employees or to damage the property of the organization. In a displaced expression of rage, customers redirect their rage emotions toward a target other than the main cause of their rage. In non-verbal expressions of rage, customers roll their eyes, shake their head, and give dirty looks to service employees (McColl-Kennedy et al., 2009).</p>
        <p>Customer aggression is defined as customers' intentional behaviors which are detrimental in nature and cause discomfort to the organization and its employees (Grandey et al., 2007;Severance et al., 2013). Customer aggression can take various direct and indirect forms and can</p>
        <p>Intentional behaviors that cause discomfort to the organization and its employees (Grandey et al., 2007). be manifested at different levels, such as physical aggression, non-verbal aggression, verbal aggression, and displaced aggression (McColl-Kennedy et al., 2009;Severance et al., 2013). All these levels of aggression have an impact on the organization (e.g. impact on its frontline employees, property belonging to the organization, or other customers).</p>
        <p>The behavioral manifestation of aggression can be overt (e.g. verbally attacking a frontline employee) or covert (e.g. destroying property when no one is looking) (Severance et al., 2013). In overt aggression, the intent is clear, and actions are directed toward the main target. In covert aggression, however, the intent is latent, and behaviors are not directed toward the main target of aggression. Aggressive behaviors exist on a continuum ranging from a low degree of threat (e.g. spreading rumors) to a high degree of threat (e.g. physical violence).</p>
        <p>In this section, a wide range of customer behaviors grouped in this paper as the dark side of customer behavior is presented. Conceptually, there are some overlaps of the terms used in the literature; for instance, customer mistreatment could be a manifestation of customer revenge, as customers aim to be disrespectful towards frontline employees in order to inflict harm on the organization. On a similar line, mistreatment could also relate to dysfunctional behavior in societies where the norm is to have convivial interactions between customers and frontline employees. A way in which researchers (e.g. Fullerton &amp; Punj, 2004) have attempted to provide more clarity in distinguishing among different concepts under the umbrella term of the dark side of customer behavior is by examining the phenomena beyond the micro-level (e.g. the manifestation of attitudinal, affective and behavioral negative outcomes) and by looking at the meso and macro levels in which the phenomena occur. Therefore, future researchers can be guided by the level at which the phenomena are being studied (e.g. micro, meso, and macro) in order to obtain conceptual clarity of the most appropriate constructs to utilize.</p>
        <p>A literature review represents a specific scientific inquiry, a method by which previous research is collected and summarized (Snyder, 2019) to improve understanding and outline an agenda for future research (Kumar et al., 2020). With the increasing focus on rigor in literature reviews, outlined primarily by questioning data transparency and synthesis of findings, structured (systematic) literature reviews have become a common method of reviewing literature. The main characteristic of SLRs is transparency in data collection and synthesis, which leads to a higher degree of objectivity and reproducibility (Tranfield et al., 2003). Various types of SLRs can be found in the literature (Vlačić et al., 2021), such as structured reviews that focus on widely used methods, theories, and constructs (e.g. Casprini et al., 2020), theorybased reviews (e.g. Ozturk, 2020), meta-analyses (e.g. Fetscherin &amp; Heinrich, 2015), bibliometric reviews (e.g. Randhawa et al., 2016), etc. While one of the main aims in structuring literature reviews through all these methods is to ensure that the process is replicable, objective, transparent, and rigorous (Crossan &amp; Apaydin, 2010), there are still various biases pertaining to the SLR process (Grant &amp; Booth, 2009). One is that with the increase in available articles that are more and more multidisciplinary in nature, it is difficult for researchers to form a valid assumption about a particular area for searching the topic of interest or to develop a list of journals to ensure that all relevant articles are selected for further analysis. Thus, SLRs still need a significant manual effort from the researcher (Zupić &amp; Čater, 2015), which is of course prone to various biases (Grant &amp; Booth, 2009). To minimize bias inherent to manual work, this study combines a bibliometric analysis with a structured content analysis to provide an integrative framework for defining future research agendas. This approach allows for the integration of "the principles of both bibliometric and structured reviews" (Paul &amp; Criado, 2020, p. 2), while minimizing the subjective bias of authors and providing a more objective representation of the research field (Donthu et al., 2021).</p>
        <p>To explore the structure of literature on the dark side of customer and consumer behavior, we establish a research protocol (e.g. Vlačić et al., 2021), starting with data collection, moving to a bibliometric analysis (Castriotta et al., 2019), and finishing with a structured content analysis. The bibliometric analysis is combined with social network analysis, with the aim of revealing the structure and central themes of a research field (Carrington et al., 2005). Thus, the results of bibliometric and social network analyses are used as inputs to structured content analysis to identify current trends, knowledge clusters, and future research directions. Fig. 1 illustrates the protocol used in this study.</p>
        <p>Our research started with data collection as per Fig. 1. Following previous SLR studies (e.g. Hiebl, 2021;Radu-Lefebvre et al., 2021), we used criteria sampling to identify articles in the area of the dark side of customer and consumer behavior. As a first step, the search string was developed ((consumer* OR customer*) AND (incivility OR aggression OR rage OR misbehav* OR mistreatment OR mis-treatment OR devian* Fig. 1. Research protocol.</p>
        <p>OR revenge OR dysfunction* OR retaliation OR vengeance OR reprisal OR retribution)) based on discussions with six academics who helped in identifying a list of terms to be used in this study that correspond to the dark side of customer behavior (see Table 1). The search string was constructed to include the facets and conceptualizations that capture the dark side of customer and consumer behavior.</p>
        <p>In the first step, we used the abovementioned search terms in the database SCOPUS to search the corpus by a combination of title, abstract, and author keyword. This search resulted in 3211 documents. By manually reviewing the titles and abstracts of the initial search results, we found that more than 90 % of the articles did not fall within the scope of our interest (e.g. they focused mainly on employee and HR perceptions of questionable customer behavior, psychological states, and clinical treatments of dark-side behavior etc.). In addition, we realized that the articles in the area of the dark side of customer behavior very neatly specified the type of dark side behavior they focused on in the title. Thus, we narrowed down the search by focusing on the title only and performing the following search: (TITLE (consumer* OR customer*) AND TITLE (incivility OR aggression OR rage OR misbehav* OR mistreatment OR mis-treatment OR devian* OR revenge OR dysfunction* OR retaliation OR vengeance OR reprisal OR retribution)) that resulted in 356 articles. In line with other reviews (Fitz-Koch et al., 2018), we excluded books, book chapters, PhD dissertations, and conference proceedings. In addition, our inclusion criteria were based only on articles published in English in the area of business and management, leaving us with the final collection of 231 articles.</p>
        <p>Following standard practice in scientific business and management research (Radu-Lefebvre et al., 2021), we conducted an additional keyword search of the Web of Science (WoS) database to ensure that we did not omit relevant texts. For this search, we used the same keyword as in SCOPUS and obtained 206 articles. Next, we compared two datasets from WoS with that from SCOPUS, checking for duplications. This process found 17 new articles from WoS that were not present in the dataset obtained through the search of SCOPUS. The authors read the abstracts of each of these texts and excluded two studies from the WoS dataset whose focus was outside the scope of this review. Consensus on the exclusion of these two papers was reached based on whether or not the topic of the dark side of customer behavior was the focus of the article. In total, this step added an additional 15 articles to the final dataset, which now includes 246 articles to be analyzed. The full list of reviewed manuscripts is included as online supplementary material.</p>
        <p>Searches of the WoS and SCOPUS databases for the data collection were conducted in July 2022. WoS and SCOPUS were selected because they are considered leading citation databases (Zhu &amp; Liu, 2020) that provide complete information on scientific papers (i.e. title, authors, abstract, keywords, and publication characteristics) as well as the references used in each paper.</p>
        <p>The next stage of the research protocol presented in Fig. 1 is the bibliometric analysis, that is performed using descriptive and citation analyses. Descriptive analysis shows the annual trend of publications in the field, the leading journals in the field, and the geographical scope of interest in the subject based on the institutions and countries of the main authors in the field. Further, we utilized common bibliometric methods used in social sciences (e.g. Baker et al., 2020;Vrontis &amp; Christofi, 2021), such as co-citation analysis, keyword co-occurrence analysis, coauthorship analysis, and clustering technique. Usually, different software (e.g. 
            <rs type="software">BibExcel</rs>, 
            <rs type="software">BibliometrixR</rs>, 
            <rs type="software">BiblioMaps</rs>, 
            <rs type="software">CiteSpace</rs>, 
            <rs type="software">Cit-NetExplorer</rs>, 
            <rs type="software">SciMAT</rs>, 
            <rs type="software">Sci2 Tool</rs>, 
            <rs type="software">VOSviewer</rs>) can be used for these types of analyses. We used 
            <rs type="software">BibExcel</rs> (Persson et al., 2009) for data cleaning and 
            <rs type="software">VOSviewer</rs> (Van Eck &amp; Waltman, 2010) for bibliometric analysis.
        </p>
        <p>BibExcel was chosen because it offers flexibility and is compatible with 
            <rs type="software">VOSviewer</rs> (Persson et al., 2009). On the other hand, 
            <rs type="software">VOSviewer</rs> provides a high-quality visual representation, with the ability to map a large number of elements, i.e. 100 or more (Sinkovics &amp; Sinkovics, 2016). We first imported the bibliographic data for the entire sample (i.e. 246 articles) into BibExcel, cleaned the data there and imported it to 
            <rs type="software">VOSviewer</rs>, creating a separate network and map file for each analysis. The final stage in our research protocol, as per Fig. 1, is structured content analysis, which identifies avenues for further research.
        </p>
        <p>Fig. 2 shows the number of primary articles published on the dark side of customer and consumer behavior from 1976 to July of 2022. It is interesting to note that although interest in the dark side of customer and consumer behavior began early, in 1976, the expansion of the field has occurred only in the last five years. This is consistent with our knowledge of the dark side of customer and consumer behavior, which states that concepts such as consumer incivility, misbehavior etc. are a relatively new phenomenon that has only recently begun to receive more research attention (Fombelle et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>As per Table 2, the most cited author in the field is Y. Grégoire, while L.C. Harris has published the most articles (12). The most active institutions in this area are Cardiff Business School with eight, followed by Queensland University of Technology and Hanyang University with five papers each. Furthermore, most articles in this field are written by scholars affiliated with universities in the United States (80 articles), followed by Australia, China, and the United Kingdom. It is encouraging to observe that research in this area is gaining attention in other parts of the world outside the US, although to a smaller extent.</p>
        <p>We created a map to capture the collaboration patterns between researchers from different institutions. Each red node indicates an institution that published articles along with researchers from other institutions in the primary collection of articles in our dataset (see Fig. 2. Papers published on the dark side of customer and consumer behavior . Fig. 3). It is interesting to note that researchers from Queensland University of Technology have the most diverse list of collaborators. Further, articles from our primary sample were mainly published in business and management journals, with service journals playing an important role. The 246 articles appeared in 96 journals, and Table 3 lists the 25 journals with the most articles on the dark side of consumer and customer behavior. The leading journals are the International Journal of Hospitality Management, the Journal of Services Marketing, and the Journal of Business Research, followed by the Journal of Service Research. Further, many of these journals have an Academic Journal Guide (AJG) rating of 4*, 4, or 3, which implies that the topic of the dark side of consumer and customer behavior receives attention in the top-tier journal outlets, highlighting the importance and relevance of this topic.</p>
        <p>The primary dataset ( 246) is first imported into 
            <rs type="software">BibExcel</rs> for preprocessing of data, i.e. identifying and correcting possible typos or errors that commonly occur in the spelling of author or journal names.
        </p>
        <p>Next, the data is imported into 
            <rs type="software">VOSviewer</rs> to examine the journal landscape based on the citation linkage of the journals in which the papers on the dark side of customer and consumer behavior were published. The result is presented in Fig. 4, where the journals are linked together, representing a hub of knowledge in this area. The overlay color of each node corresponds to the average publication year of all articles in that journal. Cold colors (e.g. purple) represent journals (e.g. the Journal of Academy of Marketing Science, the Journal of Retailing) in which the first papers in this area were published (e.g. Geurts et al., 1976), and the nodes with warmer colors (e.g. yellow) indicate journals that have only recently begun to publish papers that address the dark side of customer and consumer behavior.
        </p>
        <p>It is interesting to observe that the Journal of Business Research is positioned as a knowledge hub for the dark side of customer and consumer behavior.</p>
        <p>Next, we examined frequencies of citations, co-occurrences between papers, and co-citations. In this process, the combination of the first author's last name and the year the manuscript was published is used as the unique identifier for a paper. Since a large number of data points</p>
        <p>Journals in which articles on the dark side of customer and consumer behavior are published.</p>
        <p>(papers) were processed, we followed the recommendation of Fernandez-Alles and Ramos-Rodríguez ( 2009) and used a cut-off point (i.e. 30), meaning that we only used papers that were cited in at least 30 other papers.</p>
        <p>First, we performed a citation analysis that measures the influence of an article by the number of times it is cited by other works and also normalized citations. Table 4 shows that the most cited article is that of Grégoire et al. (2009), which was cited 472 times at the time when the dataset was collected. It is worth noting that a more recent article by Wang et al. (2011), although it has a lower number of total citations (308), has higher normalized citations than Grégoire et al. (2009). Grégoire et al. (2009) focused on customer revenge while Wang et al. (2011) focused on customer mistreatment and employee sabotage against customers. Next, we performed social network analysis with the aim of discovering the underlying structure through analysis of patterns of relationships and interactions (Wasserman &amp; Faust, 1994). In our case, we map citation networks on Fig. 5 in order to understand the key nodes in the literature on the dark side of consumer and customer behavior, the papers that act as nodes, and which groups of scholars are strongly connected. The citation map in Fig. 5 is created based on normalized citations of the network of bibliographic data. Normalizing the citation impact is the standard method in bibliometrics (Bornmann &amp; Haunschild, 2016). Since we focus on one domain, we did not use domain normalization but time normalization to correct for the fact that older papers had more time to receive more citations compared to more recent papers.</p>
        <p>Further, the map shows the most influential papers with a threshold of 30 citations. The citation network was streamlined using the Pathfinder approach (White, 2003). The Pathfinder approach was appropriate given the aim of this analysis, as it allows the researcher to exclude all but the highest counts of document pairs from the network. This approach reduces the complexity of the network by highlighting the most salient relationships in the form of citations, which improves the comprehensibility of the obtained network. In this type of network, the dominant papers are those with a high degree of centrality visible in the Note: Please see supplementary file for bibliographic information on articles. network, as these papers have relatively more links to other papers. Dominant papers, together with other papers that are closely linked to them, form clusters; and links between dominant papers connect the clusters into a discipline (White, 2003). The size of the nodes is defined by the number of citations of the paper. The colors of the nodes are routinely allocated, and they indicate different clusters of articles, with the condition that the minimum size of the cluster is 10 articles. By looking at Fig. 5, we can more objectively observe the main articles under the umbrella of the dark side of consumer and customer behavior. The theoretical basis for the dark side of consumer and customer behavior is the paper by Wang et al. (2011), which is central to the largest cluster identified in our analysis (Cluster 3 -red). Their work examined the relationship between customer mistreatment and employee intention to sabotage customers. They found that elements such as job tenure and service rule commitment mitigated the effects of customer mistreatment. Another influential work closely related to the work of Wang et al. (2011) is the research on customer incivility by Han et al. (2016). The relationship explored in this paper was again related to negative outcomes among frontline employees. They found that customer incivility is positively related to job burnout and turnover intentions. Other influential work in the green cluster examined customer revenge. For instance, Joireman et al. (2013) found that the impact of service failure on perceived severity, blame, and sense of fairness is mediated by the inferred firm motives. Finally, in the blue cluster that focuses on customer misbehavior, the seminal work is that of Albers-Miller (1999) that examined the motivations behind the purchase of illicit products.</p>
        <p>To investigate the predominant themes in the dark side of customer and consumer behavior, we conducted a keyword co-occurrence analysis. In this analysis, we focused only on the author's keywords because the author's keywords sufficiently represent the content of an article (Christofi et al., 2021). Therefore, keyword co-occurrence is displayed in our case when two authors' keywords are listed together in an article, indicating that there is a relationship between the two concepts. Fig. 6 shows the network of top keywords. The size of the node indicates which keywords are most common in the literature. A threshold of at least five occurrences is applied. In Fig. 6, customer incivility is the most noticeable node, indicating its relative significance for the topic.</p>
        <p>In addition, Fig. 6 offers a term map of the timespan in the evolution of the dark side of consumer and customer behavior area. The overlay color of each node corresponds to the average publication year of all papers whose authors have indicated the corresponding keyword. Again, cold colors (e.g. blue) represent the keywords that were frequently used in older publications on average, and the nodes with warmer colors (e.g. yellow) show the keywords with a more recent average publication year. We can see customer incivility is a more recent term, and thus one of the reasons why the avenues for future research of this article are related to the customer incivility concept.</p>
        <p>Finally, analysis of keyword co-occurrences reveals three related research clusters around the dark side of consumer and customer behavior. In the following sections, a structured content analysis of 10 papers within each cluster is presented (Baker et al., 2020;Xu et al., 2018) as per Table 5 and Fig. 5.</p>
        <p>The first cluster examines a range of customer dysfunctional behaviors (i.e. those behaviors that deviate from the accepted norms of behavior in customer-business interactions), their drivers and moderators. Examples of dysfunctional behaviors can include verbal abuse, under-participation, and over-participation (Greer, 2015). Many studies in this cluster have tried to determine the antecedents of dysfunctional customer behavior. For instance, Reynolds and Harris (2009) investigate what aspects determine the severity of dysfunctional customer behavior. They identified psychological obstructionism, disaffection with service, and servicescape variables as being associated with the severity of deliberate dysfunctional customer acts. In a similar vein, Daunt and Harris (2012) identified three groups of motives, labelled as financial egotists, money grabbers, and ego revengers. Financial egotists aim to attain financial gains from their dysfunctional behavior and are driven by both financial and ego enhancement motivations. Money grabbers on the other hand, are mainly driven by financial motivations. Finally, ego revenger customers are driven by ego enhancement and desire for revenge.</p>
        <p>Due to the conceptual proximity of customer dysfunctional behavior and customer misbehavior, this cluster also captures some aspects of customer misbehavior, but with a focus more on typologies rather than constructs themselves. For instance, Fullerton and Punj (2004) identify different focal stakeholders of customer misbehavior, including other consumers, marketers, merchandise and services, financial assets, physical premises, and employees. Another example is the work of Fullerton and Punj (1993), who develop an input and output model that characterizes consumers' decisions to misbehave or not. The model includes consumer traits (social group, psychological characteristics, demographics), and characteristics of the exchange setting (type of product/service, physical environment, marketing).</p>
        <p>The second cluster examines a range of customer misbehavior with a wider organizational focus (i.e. not limited to frontline employees). For instance, Joireman et al. (2013) examined the antecedents, moderators, and outcomes of customer revenge. They found that inferred firm motives mediate the impact of service failure on perceived severity, blame, and fairness, as well as the impact of service failure on outcomes, such as desire for revenge/reconciliation and customer anger. Other studies</p>
        <p>Overview of clusters. within this cluster aimed to identify moderators and mediators as well as a range of theoretical lenses to explain why customers engage in these dark practices. In this respect, Grégoire et al. (2009) found that time is negatively related to customer revenge (i.e. the more time that passes, the less the desire for customer revenge) and time is positively related to customer avoidance (i.e. the more time passes, the more customers engage in avoidance behavior).</p>
        <p>Another focus of the studies within this cluster is customer rage. Customer rage comprises a spectrum of affective manifestations including ferocity, fury, wrath, disgust, contempt, scorn, and resentment (McColl-Kennedy et al., 2009). Customer rage led to physical manifestation including physical, verbal, and non-verbal expressions. Therefore, understanding the antecedents and consequences of customer rage has been a prolific area of research. From the antecedent perspective, Surachartkumtonkun et al. ( 2013) examined how customers' cognitive appraisal processes can trigger rage. They explored these processes in two contexts: when an initial service failure has occurred, and after ineffective recovery. On the other hand, when looking at the consequences of customer rage, studies within this cluster found that different forms of rage emotions led to distinct behavioral outcomes. McColl-Kennedy et al. (2009) found that rancorous and retaliatory rage is more associated with negative verbal expressions such as yelling and making insulting remarks towards employees, while retaliatory rage on its own would lead to more physical harm towards employees and brand property.</p>
        <p>Cluster 3 gathers research on customer incivility and customer mistreatment. The cluster is the largest one derived from our search criteria, and it is also the one that emerged with more recent citations, when looking at the timeline-based approach (Van Eck &amp; Waltman, 2014). The first theme integrated in this cluster is customer mistreatment and its consequences. For instance, Wang et al. (2011) examine how customers' mistreatment of employees affects the relationship that employees have with their customers. In addition, Baranik et al. (2017) examined customer mistreatment outcomes among employees, particularly emotional exhaustion, customer sabotage, well-being, and job performance. An interesting approach to customer mistreatment is the identification of mitigating factors. Wang et al. (2011) found support for the mitigating role of the resources that employees possess, such as selfefficacy for emotional regulation, in the relationship between customer mistreatment and sabotage against customers. Similarly, Song et al. (2018) investigated the ways in which perceived customer mistreatment could be mitigated through mindfulness, such as pro-social acts and perspective taking. Their findings show that both approaches significantly mitigated the perception of customer mistreatment; in particular, recalling pro-social acts significantly reduced the daily experience of customer mistreatment.</p>
        <p>Within this cluster, the most prominent construct that emerged is the one related to customer incivility and its surrounding factors. The consequences of customer incivility mainly focus on frontline employees (see Fig. 7). For instance, Han et al. (2016) examined how customer incivility can lead to negative outcomes among frontline employees, which can lead to employee burnout and intentions to leave their job. In this respect, they provide insights on moderators that can reduce this relationship, in particular related to organizational and supervisory support. Other consequences to frontline employees include stress, rumination, retaliation, and withdrawal intentions (Boukis et al., 2020). In a similar vein, Alola et al. (2019) suggest that emotional exhaustion and turnover intentions are the main outcomes of customer incivility. Some researchers tried to provide guidance on how the consequences of incivility can be mitigated. It is worth mentioning Al-Hawari et al.'s (2020) work that not only examined the relationship between customer incivility, emotional exhaustion, and ultimately service performance, but also tried to find moderating factors such as employee resilience. Finally, Walker et al. (2014) examine incivility less as an accumulated phenomenon but rather at an event level. In their study they found a relationship between customer incivility and employee incivility.</p>
        <p>From a theoretical perspective, the most common theoretical lenses of studies examining customer incivility include: the conservation of resources theory, justice theory, cognitive appraisal theory, equity theory, and fairness theory. The prominence of the conservation of resources theory emphasizes the focus on outcomes and the employee perspective that this field has focused on.</p>
        <p>Having identified and analyzed the content of papers in the abovementioned three clusters, it becomes evident that the dark side of customer behavior field has moved from trying to explain broadly customer dysfunctional behaviors/customer misbehaviors (as seen in Clusters 1 and 2) to a more detailed understanding of prominent manifestations of customer misbehavior. As part of this development process, customer mistreatment and customer incivility have emerged as growing areas within the literature of the dark side of customer behavior. Nevertheless, due to the biggest size of node being customer incivility (see Fig. 7), we provide an integrative framework summarizing the key work on customer incivility, which can be used in future research in this growing field.</p>
        <p>The starting point to create this integrative framework was Lee and Kim's (2022) review of customer incivility, which was then updated with the most recent customer incivility papers published between January 2021 (when Lee and Kim's paper was published online) and July 2022. A more comprehensive and detailed integrative framework of customer incivility emerged (see Fig. 7).</p>
        <p>This study's bibliometric analysis shows a shift of focus within the area of the dark side of customer behavior to customer incivility over time, as this concept has received increasing attention by scholars in recent years. In particular, there is a shift of focus from ostensibly destructive behaviors demonstrated by customers (e.g. customer aggression) to more subtle and often unintended dark side customer behaviors (Andersson &amp; Pearson, 1999), such as customer incivility. This resulted in the interchangeable use of the terms misbehavior and incivility in the literature. Furthermore, we find that research related to the dark side of customer behavior has customer incivility at its very heart, and it can be placed in three clusters that range from broader to more specific themes: Cluster 1 focuses on customer dysfunctional behavior; Cluster 2 ′ s themes are revenge and rage as forms of customer misbehavior; and Cluster 3 focuses on customer incivility and customer mistreatment's consequences, mediators, and moderators.</p>
        <p>In addition, this study contributes to the literature on the dark side of customer behavior in several ways. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis in the broader area of the dark side of customer behavior that helps in systematizing knowledge in the field by tackling overlapping concepts that are used to describe different forms of the dark side of customer behavior. While some studies focused on a particular concept within the dark side of customer behavior (e.g. Cortina et al., 2017), our study's focus is the broader area of the dark side of customer behavior, which allows us to see a broader picture and to map the research area. Additionally, our study covers a broader period, from 1976 to 2022, compared to previous studies (e.g. Lee &amp; Kim, 2022). Finally, our structural literature review included bibliometric analysis. By doing so, we improve transparency (Fombelle et al., 2020;Lee &amp; Kim, 2022) and replicability of our analysis.</p>
        <p>Second, following the rigorous systematic literature review that was grounded on bibliometric analysis and in-depth structured content analysis of identified clusters of the literature, customer incivility arose as a rapidly emerging theme within the dark side of customer behavior. Consequently, we developed further Lee and Kim's (2022) structural review of customer incivility by focusing on the direct antecedents and direct outcomes of customer incivility (as well as the moderators of these relationships) and updating it with papers published since January 2021. The result is a more comprehensive integrative framework that captures the emerging field of customer incivility (see Fig. 7). This nomological network maps the direct drivers and consequences of customer incivility, as well as its moderators, enabling the identification of unexplored topics of interest for future customer incivility research. Simultaneously, this integration of extant knowledge is important for managers in providing them with a clearer picture of factors that companies can either influence or not, related to negative customer behavior, allowing managers to allocate their resources more efficiently.</p>
        <p>Our study's findings suggest that within the dark side of customer behavior, future research should focus on grouping variables of interest under the customer incivility concept to advance the research in an area of increased academic interest in the last decade. To outline potential avenues for research, we propose research trends and identify exemplary research questions in Table 6.</p>
        <p>It is important to note that the approach to customer incivility in the literature thus far has mostly been behavioral, while the role of customers' cognitive processes and their emotions remains under-studied. For example, understanding the role of other core emotions such as fear, sadness, grief, boredom, or surprise in the manifestation of customer incivility would provide a better understanding of these behaviors. Furthermore, it would be important to investigate the presence or absence of appraisal processes in the manifestation of uncivil behaviors.</p>
        <p>Research on customer incivility also reveals that the intentionality of uncivil customer actions remains unclear (Cortina et al., 2017). Hence, conducting further research on the notion of intention can make a major change in how employees discern, are impacted by, and react to customers' uncivil behaviors. In particular, employees' better understanding of customers' intentions can help them regulate their emotions (Grandey et al., 2004;Hochschild, 1983).</p>
        <p>While personality traits such as neuroticism and agreeableness have been discussed as the main antecedents of customer incivility, future research can thus investigate the moderating role of service failure type and severity on the relationship between each of a customer's personality traits and customer incivility. Cortina et al.'s (2017) review of the literature on customer incivility and our own integrative framework highlight that the consequences of customer incivility beyond the customer-employee dyad have been rarely investigated in comparison to that dyad. Therefore, future studies can focus on the consequences of customer incivility beyond its impact on employees by, for example, investigating the impact of customer incivility on the organization's performance, as well as perceptual measures, such as corporate image and reputation, and its impact on other company stakeholders.</p>
        <p>Future research can also investigate the role of moderators, such as employee mindfulness (Song et al., 2018), in reducing the impact of customer incivility on employees' physical, emotional, and psychological well-being and performance. This would provide a better understanding of whether training employees would better equip them to protect themselves against uncivil customer behaviors.</p>
        <p>The contagious effect of incivility on other witnesses has been highlighted by extant research (e.g. Albrecht et al., 2017). Hence, this impact of customer incivility on other customers and other employees not involved in the incivility incident could be studied further. In this regard, Albrecht et al. (2017) suggest that the witness's level of identification with the perpetuator can have an impact on their decision to act uncivilly. Future research can determine whether creating a stronger customer-firm identification (Elsbach &amp; Bhattacharya, 2001) would help to reduce the likelihood of witnesses acting in an uncivil manner toward the employees.</p>
        <p>In this article we provided further clarity on the dark side of customer behavior. Our findings show that the dark side of customer behavior has been a prolific field of research across multiple disciplines beyond business and marketing research. Indeed, the topic has been examined through the lenses of psychology, organizational management, and sociology, and in varied sector studies such as hospitality.</p>
        <p>The bibliometric analysis uncovered the development of the dark side of customer and consumer behavior research between 1976 and 2022. An assessment of the number of published articles over time, as well as the performance of authors, institutions, journals, and countries, has been performed. The findings from this analysis show that researchers in the United States, Australia, and China are the ones that have been more active in investigating this phenomenon. Furthermore, co-citation networks have been developed and analyzed to understand how the dark side of customer behavior field is structured. The Journal of Business Research emerged as a pivotal journal in this field.</p>
        <p>In terms of theoretical contributions, this review was able to determine the concepts and main themes from which the literature in this field has been organized. By analyzing the research areas in which the articles appear, we found that across the different types of the dark side of customer behaviors, customer incivility is emerging as a focal topic that should replace different overlapping concepts used interchangeably without clear borders defined (Ugwu et al., 2021). Furthermore, by conducting a bibliometric analysis, we were able to identify three clusters where the literature on this topic has focused: (1) customer dysfunctional behavior, (2) customer rage and revenge as forms of customer misbehavior, and (3) customer mistreatment and customer incivility. Finally, we also identified that despite the growing interest in this area of the dark side of customer behavior, there are several research avenues that need to be developed to clarify the processes, moderators, emotions, and consequences of customer incivility for customers and other stakeholders of the firm.</p>
        <p>Like many others, this study is not without limitations. Following the established principle, relevant articles were identified through title search based on a list of keywords developed through the insight of six scholars. However, we are aware that the scope of an article is difficult to capture with a limited number of words in the title that needed to</p>
        <p>Future research trends and research questions.</p>
        <p>correspond with our search terms (Kitanaka et al., 2021), so relevant articles may be missed. We believe that advanced computational tools such as machine learning (ML) can help eliminate the above biases and ensure that the collection of valid articles then used for SLR is not based on keywords, but on the semantic similarity of the full texts of the articles. Unfortunately, most marketing scientists do not have the technical background to develop ML algorithms that can perform these advanced operations. Therefore, we suggest to scholars interested in performing SLR to collaborate with computer scientists to understand how text mining methods based on ML, such as topic modeling through the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model, can serve as a useful single-source reference for identifying relevant articles within a given topic. In terms of methodology, our SLR may be strengthened by multiple correspondence analysis and expert opinions on its findings.</p>
