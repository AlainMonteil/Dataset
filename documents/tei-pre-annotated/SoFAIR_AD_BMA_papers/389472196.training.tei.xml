        <p>Strategic agility offers a potential path to resolve this paradoxical situation. In this article we advance a vision in which firms nourish improvisational capabilities in order to enhance strategic agility. We develop six HRM domains of action that can enhance effective improvisation and can inform the practice of a paradox-informed HRM. We discuss their implications for HRM-based strategic agility, paradoxical HR, and improvisation.Strategic agility offers a potential path to resolve this paradoxical situation.

        <p>Prior work has highlighted generic tensions in strategic management such as stability vs. change, commitment vs. flexibility, or individual contributions vs. teamwork (Lewis, Andriopoulous &amp; Smith, 2014). These tensions arise in HRM as well, and have been proposed as key factors that can affect an organization's strategic agility. Theorists have also proposed that organizational improvisation can affect strategic agility (Cunha, Cunha &amp; Kamoche, 1999;Hadida, Tarvainen, &amp; Rose, 2015), even in large complex organizations (Zheng, Venters &amp; Cornford, 2011). We lack coherent theory, however, about specific links between HRM, strategic agility and improvisation and about links to HRM practice.Prior work has highlighted generic tensions in strategic management such as stability vs. change, commitment vs. flexibility, or individual contributions vs. teamwork (Lewis, Andriopoulous &amp; Smith, 2014).

        <p>In this paper we ask: how can HRM contribute to support strategic agility through improvisation? We present a holistic analysis of improvisation in HRM by elaborating six HRM domains of action with the potential to enhance strategic agility. We also briefly sketch possible specific contributions of improvisation to the development of strategically agile multinational corporations (MNCs). This paper develops theory on HRM and strategic agility through the lens of paradox theory (Smith &amp; Lewis, 2011).In this paper we ask: how can HRM contribute to support strategic agility through improvisation?

        <p>More specifically, it proposes that HRM can enhance strategic agility through nourishing organizational improvisational capabilities. Effective improvisation represents a synergistic tool that can resolve and even benefit from the temporal tension between sustaining the value of prior knowledge, plans or routines and proactively engaging unexpected problems and opportunities in real-time contexts (Cunha et al., 1999;Cunha, Miner &amp; Antonacopolou, 2016).More specifically, it proposes that HRM can enhance strategic agility through nourishing organizational improvisational capabilities.

        <p>In the following sections we discuss the role of HRM in the creation of strategic agility, and build on prior work to present six ways in which paradoxically-informed HRM can promote strategic agility through enhancing effective improvisation. In line with paradox scholars (Aust et al., 2015;Schad et al., 2016;Smith &amp; Lewis, 2011) we hold that paradox theory offers a systematic lens and language to explore the process of strategic agility, and that tension can be a powerful means for organizational revitalization and renewal (Putnam, Fairhurst, &amp; Banghart, 2016;Zheng, Venters &amp; Cornfeld, 2011). This aspect of strategic agility has important managerial implications and also offers fruitful insights for HRM, paradox and improvisation theory.In the following sections we discuss the role of HRM in the creation of strategic agility, and build on prior work to present six ways in which paradoxically-informed HRM can promote strategic agility through enhancing effective improvisation.

        <p>Several decades of theorizing and research have now convincingly shown multiple ways in which human resources can play powerful roles in the design and implementation of firm strategy (Boselie, Bewster &amp; Paauwe, 2009;Huselid, 1995).Several decades of theorizing and research have now convincingly shown multiple ways in which human resources can play powerful roles in the design and implementation of firm strategy (Boselie, Bewster &amp; Paauwe, 2009;Huselid, 1995).</p>
        <p>Recent work has argued that strategic HRM activities can and should turn attention to strategic agility, however, going past traditional issues such as long term planning (e.g., Nisula, &amp; Kianto, 2015). Glaister, Ahmmad and Gomes (2015, p. 1) define strategic agility as "timely decision-making to execute business strategies in advance of or in reaction to ongoing environmental trends" (see Table 1 for a definition of this and other critical concepts discussed in this paper), consistent with other prior work on strategic agility (Lewis et al, 2014). Strategic agility differs from traditional strategic management because it emphasizes strategy processes that enable a "redirection and/or reinvention of the core business without losing momentum" (Doz &amp; Kosonen, 2008, pp. 14-15). Strategic agility, then, involves a whole organization's ability to change systematically but rapidly. It can thus represent a 'structuring property' (Giddens 1984) of a collective and can be "an attribute emergent from day-to-day practices of social actors" (Zheng et al., 2011, p. 305). It differs from dynamic capabilities that involve disciplined flexibility and change routines (Pavlou &amp; El Sawy, 2010): the deployment of dynamic capabilities may but do not necessarily result in strategic agility, and typically focus less on unplanned action.Recent work has argued that strategic HRM activities can and should turn attention to strategic agility, however, going past traditional issues such as long term planning (e.g., Nisula, &amp; Kianto, 2015).

        <p>Strategic agility can involve distinct strategic improvisational actions (Baker, Miner &amp; Eeseley, 2003) but also more complex collective improvisation over time (Zheng et al., 2011). Emerging related work has emphasized the potential importance of flexible HR strategies, and partnership with senior management, and with supporting techniques such as promoting leadership dynamism and mindset change, along with talent attraction, knowledge management and upskilling programs (Ananthram &amp; Nankervis, 2013).Strategic agility can involve distinct strategic improvisational actions (Baker, Miner &amp; Eeseley, 2003) but also more complex collective improvisation over time (Zheng et al., 2011).

        <p>The concept of strategic agility not only connotes change, however, but also stresses the idea of fast and fruitful change. This is consistent with the formal definition of agility as "the ability to move quickly and easily" (Oxford Dictionary: http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com). In this paper, we emphasize this facet of agility. This temporal tensionhow to keep continuity while making rapid changerepresents a foundational issue for strategic agility. This issue also involves resolving well-known deep tensions between the past and future (Miller, Gomes and Lehman, 2016), between the value of prior plans versus the value of real time information or future imaginings (Garud, Schildt and Lant, 2014). Paradox theory offers vital lens to explore how HRM has the potential to help resolve these tensions and hence support strategic agility.The concept of strategic agility not only connotes change, however, but also stresses the idea of fast and fruitful change.

        <p>HRM theory has long noted the presence of tensions and dualities in organizations and their potential impact on HRM practices (Bosellie et al, 2009;Gerpott, 2005). Many elements of organizations present persistent tensionstensions that are crucial both theoretically and in practice (Knight &amp; Paroutis, 2016). Emerging work has started to draw on concepts from paradox theory in which tensions are not only assumed to persist, but can be proactively engaged and even linked to prosperity (Smith et al., 2016).HRM theory has long noted the presence of tensions and dualities in organizations and their potential impact on HRM practices (Bosellie et al, 2009;Gerpott, 2005).

        <p>A paradox can be defined as "contradictory yet interconnected elements that exist simultaneously and persist over time" (Smith &amp; Lewis, 2011, p. 382). Paradox theory increasingly focuses attention on situations, then, where two apparently contradictory elements persist in an organization, and expands ways in which organizations engage with this pervasive phenomenon. Traditionally, organization and HRM theory both dealt with such tensions by developing contingency theories. In what context should exploration be favored over exploitation? Cooperation over competition? Rationality over intuition? Paradox theory, however, focuses attention on ways that tensions may remain present and be resolved, or even have value for the organization. Although similar in that sense to ambidexterity theory, paradox theory underscores the potential for resolutions where two sides of a tension both remain (Li, 2016) and where their joint presence enhances value creation. Human resource management activities lie in the nexus of many such tensions. For example, human resources practices have crucial impact on the structural tensions between centralization and decentralization.A paradox can be defined as "contradictory yet interconnected elements that exist simultaneously and persist over time" (Smith &amp; Lewis, 2011, p. 382).

        <p>Human resource management scholars have started to discuss the discipline through a paradox lens (e.g. Gerpott, 2015;Legge &amp; Exley, 1975). Marchington (2015, p.176) notes that "HRM has always been located at the interface of potentially conflicting forces within organizations". International HRM researchers also observed that tensions pervade the function (Evans, Pucik &amp; Bjorkman, 2011;Glaister et al., 2014;Gomes et al., 2015). For instance, some authors have discussed the tension between home and host country HRM practices (Gomes et al., 2015) and the convergence/divergence dilemma (Sparrow, Schuler, &amp; Jackson, 1994). However, Aust, Brandl and Keegan (2015) have pointed out that work taking the paradox perspective has thus far been rare in HRM. We help fill this important conceptual gap by discussing how human resource management can enable strategic agility through the creation of conditions for productive improvisation to flourish in organizations.Human resource management scholars have started to discuss the discipline through a paradox lens (e.g. Gerpott, 2015;Legge &amp; Exley, 1975).

In this paper, we focus especially on the temporal tension flagged above: the contrast between an organization's past anticipated strategic plans, practice and knowledge, versus potential unexpected or unimagined future possibilities and knowledge that arise in real time. This tension is a temporal one-not between, say, local versus centralized action plans-but between the organization's prior knowledge resources, routines and plans, and immediate, unexpected problems and opportunities, in the context of long term prosperity. As noted above, strategic agility-in contrast to more general strategic advantagespecifically highlights the issue of fast change while maintaining momentum (Doz &amp; Kosonen, 2010). Strategic agility, then, invokes at its core the question of temporal tension between current knowledge and practice and fast execution of new strategies in ways that "turn on a dime."

        <p>Improvisation, we propose, represents one crucial process capability that can enable fast pivots involving innovation. It refers to the deliberate fusion of the design and execution of a novel production (Cunha, Cunha &amp; Kamoche, 1999;Miner, Bassoff &amp; Moorman, 2001). Its spirit is captured in everyday life by the phrase: "Make it up as you go along." Improvisation , by definition, involves novel productions, which are not fully planned in advance. However, it typically draws on or relates to prior structures: it is not original action unfolding in a void of prior templates. It can include elements of prior knowledge and plans, while still creating novel action (Cunha, Miner &amp; Antonacopolous, 2016). Different proportions of prior designs and novel elements can yield different types and degrees of improvisation (Hadida et al., 2015;Miner, Bassoff &amp; Moorman, 2001).Improvisation, we propose, represents one crucial process capability that can enable fast pivots involving innovation.

        <p>Given that strategic agility involves responsive and timely action (Glaister, Ahmmad &amp; Gomes, 2015) improvisation offers a potentially powerful activity mode to support it. Bahrami and Evans (2011, p. 23) propose that given the impossibility to "anticipate and plan ahead for every possible eventuality (…) we need the capability to draw on our 'reflexive instincts' to act 'in situ,' to improvise quickly and spontaneously, as new triggers unfold." Competent improvising also supports responsiveness and competitive agility when advantages are temporary and time dependent, as in the case of transient competitive advantage (Garud, Jain &amp; Tuertscher, 2008). As a process, then, effective improvisation becomes especially important the more environments become unpredictable. Improvisation can represent one form of concretization of the synthesis of past, present and future (Brown &amp; Eisenhardt, 1997). It can go beyond traditional resolutions of paradox such as segmentation or dialectics to approach sustained synthesis without replacing either element (Clegg, Cunha &amp; Cunha, 2002;Poole &amp; Van de Ven, 1989).Given that strategic agility involves responsive and timely action (Glaister, Ahmmad &amp; Gomes, 2015) improvisation offers a potentially powerful activity mode to support it.

        <p>Strategic agility requires competencies in moving quickly and smoothly, including in unexpected contexts. This cannot be accomplished in all cases by extensive contingency plans. This makes the ability to pivot fast while maintaining strategic coherence crucial. By definition, the specific content of improvisational action cannot be planned in advance. However, it's possible to create conditions that will enhance the odds that the improvisation process will occur and that it will be productive (Miner et al., 2001;Miner &amp; Moorman, 1998b). In this section we flag six facilitating conditions, organized by level of analysisorganizational, team, individual and contextual (Hadida et al., 2015)-noting the potential for configurational patterns as well. After briefly laying out each factor we extract related practical implications for HRM. These are not meant to be exhaustive but illustrative. We derive these conditions from the extant literature and do so in a way that covers multiple levels of analysis.

        <p>Because improvisation involves fast innovation, it presents serious challenges to coherence and coordination. A shared clear notion of their unit's ultimate goali.e. its purposeincreases the chances that people can improvise effectively. Purpose establishes the organization's core goal and helps deal with paradoxical demands (Smith, Lewis, &amp; Tushman, 2016). When people are aware of the organization's ultimate goal they can connect purpose with circumstance in an individually meaningful way (Ulrich &amp; Dulenohn, 2015). They can also coordinate reactions to unexpected events in real time, or indirectly coordinate through a common reference point for new actions. This permits strategic coherence even with unplanned innovation action. This capacity to be strategically coherent even though temporal discontinuities occur is crucial because the expression of a purpose can be different in distinct temporal contexts. Purpose, then, can constitute one of the coordinative elements of a semistructure, permitting both consistency and diversity. Purpose can serve as the improvisation referent (Miner et al., 2001), the shared nugget around which improvisational design of action occurs.Because improvisation involves fast innovation, it presents serious challenges to coherence and coordination.

        <p>Metaphorically, purpose can be to strategic agility what a song is to swing jazz improvisation, a shared partial pattern on which improvisations are anchored, an organizing support for the synthesis of consistency and variety. This shared purpose implies priorities for action. Priorities, in turn, represent a crucial coordination device when change occurs rapidly (Brown &amp; Eisenhardt, 1997). The core purpose makes it possible not only for the organization to set priorities, but for actors to revise local priorities themselves during improvisational activity. The shared purpose, can serve as a touchstone for designing new actions that all players refer to as they improvise. This can create indirect coordination where players know what the referent is, and can create innovation consistent with it, even in the absence of real time direct communication.Metaphorically, purpose can be to strategic agility what a song is to swing jazz improvisation, a shared partial pattern on which improvisations are anchored, an organizing support for the synthesis of consistency and variety.

        <p>Thus, by defining purpose (distinct from concrete specific narrow goals) and leaving space for improvisation, organizations can synthesize strategic continuity and agility. Effective improvisations around a defined purpose also typically involve states of mindfulness, i.e. present-centered awareness and attention (Good et al., 2016: Weick, 1998), instead of the automatic execution of general rules inattentive to temporal contextual change, or to unexpected problems or opportunities. When HRM helps articulate and sustain awareness of this type of purpose, this differs from classic advice that managers should establish crystal clear, quantitative goals of particular endpoints.Thus, by defining purpose (distinct from concrete specific narrow goals) and leaving space for improvisation, organizations can synthesize strategic continuity and agility.

        <p>HRM implications. The application of paradox theory to HRM issue has stressed key structural paradoxes including centralization versus decentralization and hierarchy versus lack of hierarchy (Boselie, Brewster, &amp; Paauwe, 2009S). Some have argued that structural organizational designs has become too complex hierarchical, and centralized (Cunha, Rego, &amp; Clegg, 2011). Some empirical evidence suggests that organizations may be generally evolving in this direction as reflected in the reduction of hierarchical depth (Rajan &amp; Wulff, 2003). Theorists have also argued that organizations require less complexity to become more agile in face of relentlessly changing environments (Brown &amp; Eisenhardt, 1997) and to support effective improvisation. The decrease of bureaucratic depth, however, may require a clear purpose to empower people to construct expressions of purpose at different times and contexts. This permits organizational members to make sense locally in time and place, without diminishing coordination. This combination also allows managers to act as the creators of "communities of purpose" (Fredberg, 2014). Less structure by definition involves more freedom of action, but freedom of action around a deep and active sense of purpose.HRM implications.

        <p>For HRM it means that purpose must represent a living goal rather than only a formal statement (Doz &amp; Kosonen, 2008). The value of precise quantitative targets against which action can be measured must be balanced with the value of broader sense of purpose. The higher level purpose can provide insight into when to adjust lower level goals. If and when the organization shifts to a more improvisational mode, this higher level purpose becomes the referent that actors use to design new action. The coordination occurs through this shared referent, rather than through prior formal plans or contingency arrangements. Useful statements or embodiments of purpose are more likely with attention to the degree to which shared language involves concreteness and/or general knowledge (Brannen and Doz, 2010). Zheng et al. (2011) describe how the stable shared underlying purpose of advancing scientific understanding complemented narrower project goals in a complex international decentralized physics project, illustrating this point. They show how this underling purpose allowed the organization to successfully accommodate several different types of change over time, including improvisational actions.For HRM it means that purpose must represent a living goal rather than only a formal statement (Doz &amp; Kosonen, 2008).

        <p>Organizing prompts routine and routine can neutralize agility. This opposition, however, is not inevitable. Research suggests that in some sectors agility is supported by appropriate structure, not by the lack of it (Patriotta &amp; Gruber, 2016). Research on improvisation has repeatedly emphasized the importance of partial structure. An excess of structure can be as pernicious to spontaneous behavior as the lack of it. By an excess of structure we mean a profusion of coercive rules as well as a culture of normative enforcement of rules. In this combination, organizational members can feel pressed to conformity and eschew innovation of any type, thus avoiding improvisation as well.Organizing prompts routine and routine can neutralize agility.

        <p>On the other hand, the lack of structure can permit improvisation but spawn ineffective or even harmful improvisation that leads to contradictory action. It deters effective improvisation, the crucial element for strategic agility. Highly unstructured settings can nourish complacency with unfocused improvisations and, over time, stimulate a "firefighting" mindset rather than a strategic orientation approach that incorporates the space for improvisations necessary to adapt to the unexpected (Patriotta &amp; Gruber, 2016). Instead of letting a "thousand flowers bloom", the complacent organization may instead produce "a garden full of weeds" (Criscuolo, Salter &amp; Ter Wal, 2014, p.1289). The implication for HRM is that organizations need to cultivate structures that both empower and that require accountability. These designs define the goals but assume the need for adjustments. Semi-structured or minimally-structured designs (Brown &amp; Eisenhardt, 1997;Kamoche &amp; Cunha, 2001) offer individuals the freedom to express spontaneity but also create the accountability so they take responsibility for the outcomes of their agentic power.On the other hand, the lack of structure can permit improvisation but spawn ineffective or even harmful improvisation that leads to contradictory action.

        <p>HRM implications. Organizational structures have been often been thought of as control mechanisms. From a paradoxical perspective, they represent sources of control and of empowerment. Organization theory offers indications on how to construct these paradox-receptive strategies. Designing organizations around simple rules (Eisenhardt &amp; Sull, 2001) can provide the synthesis of coordination and freedom supportive of both strategy and agility. Simple rules also provide a template within which effective improvisation can occur, a constraint that permits fruitful variation.HRM implications.

        <p>This offers strategic agility with the rules providing constraints that promote continuity and accountability. HR professionals involved in organizational re-designs can direct attention to finding appropriate balances within the whole system so that the overall level of structure permits creative improvisation when it is valuable. Even job design can usefully involve varied levels of structure, where some jobs are structured in tight detail, but other jobs are better left only partially structured, with more room for later improvisation (Cohen et al., 2016).This offers strategic agility with the rules providing constraints that promote continuity and accountability.

        <p>Effective improvisation in organizations is often a team effort (Hadida et al., 2015). For people to improvise effectively involves a number of conditions. It is more likely when people share common knowledge (Nisula &amp; Kianto, 2015), mutual consideration and trustful relationships (Carmeli et al., forthcoming;Yanow, 2001). In the absence of these collective antecedents resorting to standard and routine can be tempting. The openness to face the risks associated with improvisation demands a climate of psychological safety. Improvisation can be seen as a process of learning while doing (Miner et al., 2001). Research reveals that learning in teams thrives on the combination of psychological safety and accountability (Edmondson &amp; Lei, 2014). A lack of psychological safety will prevent individuals from risk assumption and experimentation; the deficit of accountability will permit dangerous diffusion of responsibility and the "weed garden" phenomenon mentioned above.Effective improvisation in organizations is often a team effort (Hadida et al., 2015).

        <p>Improvisation involves an element of risk because the performance of action occurs while it is designed, and in that sense improvisation is irreversible (Hadida et al, 2015;Miner et al, 2001). By definition, novel action is designed during its performance, so is not designed as part of the formal planning system. It often occurs when routines are seen as not appropriate. Consistent with novel activity in general (March, 1991), improvisation can lead to ineffective or even to harmful outcomes. Therefore, it is often prudent for individuals to avoid improvising. In many organizational contexts, it seems more likely that individuals will be sanctioned for improvising rather than for not doing so (Batista, Cunha, Clegg, Rego &amp; Giustiniano, 2016), which is consistent with an organization seeking to capture the value of prior learning.Improvisation involves an element of risk because the performance of action occurs while it is designed, and in that sense improvisation is irreversible (Hadida et al, 2015;Miner et al, 2001).

        <p>To stimulate improvisation, organizations need to build the self-confidence of their members. The importance of self-confident employees for agile responding in general has been proclaimed by managers (Elderkin &amp; Bartlett, 1983, Finkelstein, 2016). Scholarly research has theorized that actors with high Self efficacy will have a more positive attitude towards improvisation (Magni, Provera &amp; Proserpio, 2010).To stimulate improvisation, organizations need to build the self-confidence of their members.

        <p>Confidence is especially important because as noted, improvised actions occur in real time, and in a sense are irreversible: actors do not test out a novel idea "off line" but interact ongoing events instead, which adds a distinct sense of risk taking. In this context, employees with a sense of self-confidence are more apt to improvise because they trust that their competences will be on par with their challenges.Confidence is especially important because as noted, improvised actions occur in real time, and in a sense are irreversible: actors do not test out a novel idea "off line" but interact ongoing events instead, which adds a distinct sense of risk taking.

        <p>Self-confidence, however, has a downside. It can stimulate the unrealistic acceptance of excessively stretching goals (Cunha, Giustiniano, Rego &amp; Clegg, 2016;Sitkin, See, Miller, Lawless &amp; Carton, 2011), as well as the discounting of competitors' competences. It can stimulate improvisation, while also reducing the chances that the improvisation will be realistic or effective. Excessive self-confidence can thus undermine the potential benefits of improvisational activity.Self-confidence, however, has a downside.

        <p>For this reason, employee self-confidence should be accompanied by the cultivation of humility, defined as a balanced view of strengths and weaknesses (Owens &amp; Hekman, 2012). For effective improvisation, both confidence and humility matter.For this reason, employee self-confidence should be accompanied by the cultivation of humility, defined as a balanced view of strengths and weaknesses (Owens &amp; Hekman, 2012).

        <p>Organizations need to prepare their members to combine a paradoxical sense of confidence and humility. Self-confident humility will simultaneously equip employees and their leaders with the willingness to face the risk to improvise as well as with the clear understanding that improvisation is, organizationally, a deviation from tried and tested paths and a factor of risk. Supporting research shows that in dynamic contexts, entrepreneurs with moderate levels of optimism, which is consistent with confidence mixed with humility, create higher firm performance than those with extremely high optimism (Hmielksi, Corbett &amp; Baron, 2013).Organizations need to prepare their members to combine a paradoxical sense of confidence and humility.

To foster self-confidence organizations may invest in cultivating the positive psychological capital (PsyCap) of their members (Luthans, Youssef-Morgan, &amp; Avolio, 2015).

        <p>Market intelligence is critical for organizations to capture and remain in sync with the world around them (Bouquet &amp; Birkinshaw, 2008). The process of gathering and incorporating market intelligence, however, can be problematic. Organizations, even sophisticated MNCs, often ignore or misrepresent the signals from their environments (Vuori &amp; Huy, 2016). Organizations however can stimulate an improvisational mindset by conducting expeditions in their peripheries (Day &amp; Schoemaker, 2004;Hamel &amp; Prahalad, 1990). This process also provides real time information that can increase the chances that improvisation will be effective (Moorman &amp; Miner, 1998a).

        <p>The notion of the periphery applies to "wherever attention is not," i.e. the total set of an organization's blind spots. The periphery matters: organizational scholars and management practitioners often heed the notion of knowledge but also often miss the importance of ignorance. Yet ignorance can be as important as knowledge. Exploring the periphery may increase an organization's market orientation and make it able to receive signals of issues necessitating immediate attention. Scanning the periphery thus can help create a propensity to improvise via the trained awareness to respond to the environment.The notion of the periphery applies to "wherever attention is not," i.e. the total set of an organization's blind spots.

        <p>At the same time, it is well established that organizations can gain value from focus. Consider for example, the well-known "segmenting-targeting-positioning" mantra in marketing or the established importance of goals, plans, and other attentionfocusing conceptual tools. However, according to proponents of the notion of the periphery, organizations can usefully compose teams to explore their peripheries of attention to disturb crystalized processes of sensemaking. Teams exploring the periphery can bring fresh insights that will potentially activate corrective behaviors not only through planned innovation but also through improvisation (Cunha &amp; Chia, 2007).At the same time, it is well established that organizations can gain value from focus.

        <p>HRM implications. Exploratory actions can be important to facilitate rich sensemaking processes. However, knowing something about the periphery does not automatically translate into doing what could be done (Pfeffer &amp; Sutton, 2000), promote attention to the periphery, and even to create referents that could be used in later improvisation (Postma &amp; Lieble, 2005).HRM implications.

        <p>National cultures and institutions appear to influence the predisposition to take action spontaneously, and thus to improvise (Aram &amp; Walochik, 1996 Cross-level theorizing is especially promising in order to explore how national cultures translate into practices at the organizational, team, and individual levels. At the national culture level, the intensity of normative enforcement and the level of individualism or collectivism may condition the willingness to see rules as definitive or indicative. At the organizational level, the depth of bureaucratic mentality may be influential. Bureaucratic cultures with a logic of normative enforcement reduce the willingness to improvise and increase the action risk of innovating in general. In teams, local peculiarities are especially important. For example, in the Chinese context, the concept of moqi (mo-chee) means a profound understanding between two individuals (e.g. supervisor and subordinate). This understanding resonates with reciprocation in jazz improvisation (Barkema, Chen, George, Luo &amp; Tsui, 2015, p.471). This propensity for mutual attention should increase the chances of effective improvisation. However, it also raises the issue of what happens in an MNC, where employees sensitive to the importance of moqi collaborate with others who do not abide by it.National cultures and institutions appear to influence the predisposition to take action spontaneously, and thus to improvise (Aram &amp; Walochik, 1996 Cross-level theorizing is especially promising in order to explore how national cultures translate into practices at the organizational, team, and individual levels.

        <p>HRM implication. From a paradoxical HRM perspective, it seems conceptually promising to suggest that (1) in external environments (countries, regions or industries, for example) with a propensity for improvisation, managers should introduce the necessary amount of structure to seed effective improvisation and avoid disarray, and that (2) in environments rich in structure, managers should enable cultures that promote effective improvisation. From this perspective, an excess of structure will create strategic and operational coherence at the cost of agility, but an excess of improvisation will create an excess of agility at the cost of diminished strategic coherence. This matches the emphasis above on encouraging semi-structured organizations with sufficient gaps to enable effective improvisation. Attention to nuances such as how different national predispositions interact with coordination during improvisation will be important for such interventions.HRM implication.

        <p>First, improvisational capabilities at all levels may contribute to building and maintaining center/periphery relationships characterized by balance and mutual consideration. A recurrent problem in the MNC refers to perceived headquarters domination of the decision-making process, which is related to the structural paradox of centralization versus decentralization (Gomes et al., 2015). The perceived (or actual) domination can keep subsidiaries from shaping and translating knowledge and potential related to external changes that they detect, or to static differences from others. The resulting "dominant mothership" (Birkinshaw et al., 2015) syndrome can be a source of perceived subsidiary powerlessness and limit the motivation of front line employees to act creatively. This, in turn, will potentially deprive the organizational center of relevant inputs, and subsidiaries from expressing local responsiveness to unexpected temporal or cross sectional variation. Improvisational space legitimized across the organization can thus be a potent long-term source of corporate balance and contribute to the experiments work, they can be repeated, perfected and retained (Miner et al., 2001).First, improvisational capabilities at all levels may contribute to building and maintaining center/periphery relationships characterized by balance and mutual consideration. A recurrent problem in the MNC refers to perceived headquarters domination of the decision-making process, which is related to the structural paradox of centralization versus decentralization (Gomes et al., 2015). The perceived (or actual) domination can keep subsidiaries from shaping and translating knowledge and potential related to external changes that they detect, or to static differences from others.

        <p>Sometimes these improvisations arise "under the radar" in the sense that there is little or no formal resource allocation or written permission to undertake them, (as when product designers improvise new product features related to novel product markets with ad hoc materials (Garud et al, 2008). If they work, the improvised innovation and any implied strategic redirection can be formally presented to the headquarters in a refined form. A subsidiary that coherently transforms local improvised experiments in this way can increase the "extent to which a parent company recognizes and gives credit to a subsidiary for its contribution to the MNE as a whole" (Bouquet &amp; Birkinshaw, 2008, p.579).Sometimes these improvisations arise "under the radar" in the sense that there is little or no formal resource allocation or written permission to undertake them, (as when product designers improvise new product features related to novel product markets with ad hoc materials (Garud et al, 2008).

        <p>Third, at the same time, the subsidiary may gain in strategic impact, as the improvisational experiments at the subsidiary level can be sources of corporate revitalization. In effect, improvising around possibilities and selecting the best to travel to the corporate level may contribute to corporate renewal via "bottom-up relational processes" (Bouquet &amp; Birkinshaw, 2008). This form of innovation can have special impact because the unplanned elements of improvised action by definition were not already known to the improvisers or headquarters in advance. The process is not the familiar corporate creation of official "skunk works," but rather unofficial spontaneous creation of new action patterns. The classic exemplar of Honda team improvising novel product and market strategies while introducing motorcycles into the United States illustrates this process (Cunha, Clegg, Rego, &amp; Lindsay, 2015).Third, at the same time, the subsidiary may gain in strategic impact, as the improvisational experiments at the subsidiary level can be sources of corporate revitalization.

        <p>Headquarters' respect for improvisational spaces can stimulate the sort of organizational experiments that happen under the conditions above of safety and accountability. Such possibility has been explored by improvisation theorists (Cunha, Neves, Clegg &amp; Rego, 2015). Illustrating this possibility, an HR manager in a highly centralized Southern European subsidiary of a pharmaceutical company explained that some projects have to be sometimes conducted "under the radar" (personal communication, 23 December, 2015). From the point of view of the MNC these projects are improvised because they were not fully planned in advance. Even from the point of view of the local teams, they often involve unplanned discovery and experientially driven projects. Miner et al. (2001) similarly describe new product and potential new product markets developed through improvisation done in a scientific instruments firm. This informal improvisational space presents two major advantages: it grants protection when experiments fail, as these are formally nonexistent, and they can be communicated and formally submitted to center only in case they work. This mode of operation can be a safe source of innovation from the periphery to the core.Headquarters' respect for improvisational spaces can stimulate the sort of organizational experiments that happen under the conditions above of safety and accountability.

        <p>Fourth, by stimulating close connections with temporal changes visible to a given local market or community, and to cross sectional variation across subsidiaries and communities, organizations may facilitate innovation from the inside out (Simanis &amp; Hart, 2009). Improvising locally can involve direct contact between organization members and communities. This in turn can carry inside fresh narratives and, in this way, help to amend sensemaking and unfreeze established narratives inside the firm.Fourth, by stimulating close connections with temporal changes visible to a given local market or community, and to cross sectional variation across subsidiaries and communities, organizations may facilitate innovation from the inside out (Simanis &amp; Hart, 2009).

        <p>Improvisational activity in the periphery may thus legitimize and give voice to change agents whose power resides in the narratives they bring forth (Bosma, Chia &amp; Fouweather, 2016). Peripheral interactions can provide input for improvisations via the narrative power of stories that challenge the prevalent modes of sensemaking (Vaara, Sonenshein &amp; Boje, 2016). Managersespecially HR managerscan use new stories as scaffolds for a broader exploratory mindset (March, 1991). This differs from discoveries or innovation pathways planned in advance in formal research programs. It offers a crucial but distinct pathway to strategic agility for the MNC.Improvisational activity in the periphery may thus legitimize and give voice to change agents whose power resides in the narratives they bring forth (Bosma, Chia &amp; Fouweather, 2016).

        <p>In this section we briefly elaborate key implications of the previous sections. We consider implications for the three intertwined conceptual streams explored in the article: HRM and strategic agility, HRM and paradox theory (Aust et al., 2015) and improvisation theory (Cunha et al., 2016). The importance of improvisational capabilities has been explored in several domains, but especially in information systems (Pavlou &amp; El Sawy, 2010, Zheng et al., 2011) and new product development (Brown &amp; Eisenhardt, 1997, Miner et al., 2001). The themes of paradox and improvisation, however, have received less attention in the field of HRM. In this section we outline some possible paths for the integration of agility, paradox, and improvisation in the HRM agenda.In this section we briefly elaborate key implications of the previous sections.

        <p>The six specific action possibilities discussed above, and their potential interaction with each other, offer a vision of HRM's proactive role in creating and sustaining strategic agility. This vision goes past the traditional HRM roles in supporting specific strategies designed by others. Here, HRM plays not only a partner role with others, but a core role in designing the system that can permit the organization as a whole to count on strategic agility. It also goes beyond the five leadership practices related to strategic agility more broadly (Lewis et al., 2014) that are more general.The six specific action possibilities discussed above, and their potential interaction with each other, offer a vision of HRM's proactive role in creating and sustaining strategic agility.

        <p>Several aspects of the framework described are especially closely linked to HRM functions in particular, rather than simple general structural design elements.Several aspects of the framework described are especially closely linked to HRM functions in particular, rather than simple general structural design elements.</p>
        <p>Also, each proposition highlights a pair of design elements rather than single element at a time. This reflects the underlying focus on the vision of productive tensions as positive engines for organizational prosperity. It underscores the importance of nuanced attention on how to combine potentially contradictory elements, and the importance of assessing their relative presence. Nourishing structures that both empower and include accountability, teams that both protect and challenge, and building self-confidence combined with humility all resonate with traditional HR function activities, regardless of which specific organizational members carry them out. All of these create a climate more conducive to skilled and effective improvisation.Also, each proposition highlights a pair of design elements rather than single element at a time.

        <p>To fully capture the potential fruit of these conditions, however, specific training in improvisation stands out as a promising next step with high potential (Vera &amp; Crossan, 2004) (Li, 2016), training managers in "both/and" forms of leadership (Smith, Lewis &amp; Tushman, 2016), emphasizing the synergistic potentialities of paradoxical practices such as improvisation (Hargrave &amp; Van de Ven, 2016;Zheng et al., 2011).To fully capture the potential fruit of these conditions, however, specific training in improvisation stands out as a promising next step with high potential (Vera &amp; Crossan, 2004) (Li, 2016), training managers in "both/and" forms of leadership (Smith, Lewis &amp; Tushman, 2016), emphasizing the synergistic potentialities of paradoxical practices such as improvisation (Hargrave &amp; Van de Ven, 2016;Zheng et al., 2011).</p>
        <p>The vision explored here goes past traditional organizational elements to promote long-term adaptation such as decentralized systems that separate exploration and exploitation activities (March, 1991), processes to spur unplanned evolutionary change (Miner, 1984), minimal structures that permit adjustment to changing temporal or crosssectional contexts (Brown &amp; Eisenhardt, 1997) or designs focused on ambidexterity that sustains two contrasting and still separate organizational elements (Juni, Sarala, Taras &amp; Tarba, 2013;Lewis &amp; Smith, 2014). Our approach squarely embraces a paradox lens in which apparently contrasting elements not only can coexist but can fuse and in some cases dealing with them using a paradox lens can actually lead to new forms of value (Andriopolous &amp; Lewis, 2009;Poole &amp;Van de Ven, 1989;Smith &amp; Lewis, 2011).The vision explored here goes past traditional organizational elements to promote long-term adaptation such as decentralized systems that separate exploration and exploitation activities (March, 1991), processes to spur unplanned evolutionary change (Miner, 1984), minimal structures that permit adjustment to changing temporal or crosssectional contexts (Brown &amp; Eisenhardt, 1997) or designs focused on ambidexterity that sustains two contrasting and still separate organizational elements (Juni, Sarala, Taras &amp; Tarba, 2013;Lewis &amp; Smith, 2014).

        <p>There is growing awareness that the work of HRM is replete with tension and ambiguity. However, Aust et al. (2015, p.208) observed that "at this point in time, paradox HRM studies are rare." The framework above contributes to paradox HRM research by exploring the role of HRM related actions and organizational design to promote improvisation in the construction and preservation of strategic agility. We also explored how the HRM function may contribute to develop a paradoxical HRM in the context of the MNC, a preoccupation that echoes recent investigation in the HRM discipline (Link &amp; Muller, 2015). Stimulating attention to the paradoxical ethos of HRM, especially in the context of the MNC, is an important step forward as this topic has been under-researched thus far.There is growing awareness that the work of HRM is replete with tension and ambiguity.

        <p>The combined reasoning above also contributes to the development of paradox theory more broadly. By focusing on HRM related activities, it explores paradoxical elements in an undertheorized domain. Further, it emphasizes several different organizational design elements that we argue can help organizational members deal with the apparently inconsistent and contradictory aspects of their settings. The emphasis on self-confidence linked with humility, for example, highlights a specific combination of organizational features that may strengthen the ability of actors not only to accept paradox but to harvest its positive potential. Future work can fruitfully investigate how the relative presence of each of the two features in one of the highlighted pairs influences outcomes.The combined reasoning above also contributes to the development of paradox theory more broadly.

        <p>This article contributes to improvisation theory first by discussing its articulation with the HRM function. Pioneering work by authors such as Nisula and Kianto (2015) have called attention to the role of HRM in shaping individual level improvisation but, as the authors note, leaves many question unanswered. The ideas above, to our knowledge, are the first to explicate how HRM can deliberately contribute to create strategic agility via improvisation. An important corpus of literature explored the strategic role of the HRM function but not much is known about the role of HRM in the construction of strategically agile firms through improvisational capabilities. This represents a valuable future research avenue.This article contributes to improvisation theory first by discussing its articulation with the HRM function.

        <p>This paper also advances improvisation theory more broadly and details several distinct issues to be addressed in the deliberate cultivation of improvisational capabilities. First, organizational designs that promote improvisation may not necessarily promote valuable improvisation. In several cases, this implies the importance of nourishing related features such as confidence and humility or supportiveness and accountability. These foster effective versus potentially harmful improvisation. Our theory provides an important context for extant research, such as the finding that founder improvisation in the presence of moderate optimism led to better performance than improvisation in the presence of extremely high optimism (Hmielski et al., 2013).This paper also advances improvisation theory more broadly and details several distinct issues to be addressed in the deliberate cultivation of improvisational capabilities.

        <p>Second, combining the different elements discussed here implies that improvisation can play not just one but several different roles in agility and renewal more broadly. Our theory implies that it can involve detection of external changes and alertness to unimagined opportunities, encourage redeployment of current resources, form the basis of long-term trial and error learning, and increase the richness of employee emotional and life experience, all areas of potential importance. These separate processes advance the range of improvisational impact (Cunha et al., 2016;Hadida et al., 2015).Second, combining the different elements discussed here implies that improvisation can play not just one but several different roles in agility and renewal more broadly.

        <p>Improvisation can be seen as a form of paradox, given that much theory takes it for granted that planning and adaptation are mutually inconsistent, with one preceding the other. Improvisation synthesizes both, however, without replacing either (Clegg et al., 2002). Improvisation is not the denial of strategy or the absence of strategy (Baker et al., 2003). Instead it can be a product of a strategic orientation that is continuously maintained in tune with environmental change. Effective improvisation does not occur in the absence of responsibility, but in the context of accountability that by definition implies a dose of freedom.Improvisation can be seen as a form of paradox, given that much theory takes it for granted that planning and adaptation are mutually inconsistent, with one preceding the other.

        <p>The development of organizations with a proclivity to improvise effectively is a difficult endeavor. Organizational improvisation is often represented as a practice emerging from a purely ad hoc orientation, in the absence of preparation. This is a faulty interpretation of improvisation. Effective improvisation, in fact, depends on the gradual, patient construction of ability with procedural and declarative (Moorman &amp; Miner, 1998b), tacit and explicit (Yanow, 2001), individual and collective (Weick, 1993) components. This knowledge accumulation takes time and effort. As Johnson-Laird (2002, p. 439) put it, the knowledge involved in the practice of effective improvisation "is acquired at the cost of considerable work."The development of organizations with a proclivity to improvise effectively is a difficult endeavor.

        <p>The notion that effective improvisation is a fruit only of instantaneous inspiration is thus a misrepresentation, and cultivating competent improvisational skills is a painstaking endeavor. Therefore, managers may reasonably be cautious with regard to the nurturing of improvisation as they necessarily confront employees with difficult and dilemmatic choices. It is possible that, as suggested by paradox theory, when facing competing demands, managers select one pole over the other instead of considering integrative approaches, such as the one suggested here (Smith &amp; Lewis, 2011). It seems reasonable to hypothesize that when faced with the choice of control or empowerment, many managers will consider control as their best possible option. Western managers, in particular, may feel psychologically uncomfortable with paradox (Yuan &amp; Chia, 2011).The notion that effective improvisation is a fruit only of instantaneous inspiration is thus a misrepresentation, and cultivating competent improvisational skills is a painstaking endeavor.

        <p>Some cultures may also be unprepared to harvest the benefits of effective improvisation or for the conditions that can promote it. Attempts at the creation of cultures of psychological safety may be received with suspicion and cynicism and explorations of the periphery may lead to discoveries that will perturb dominant organizational discourses (Vaara et al., 2016). If some of these possibilities materialize, the knowing-doing gap can grow wider and lead to cynicism rather than to agility.Some cultures may also be unprepared to harvest the benefits of effective improvisation or for the conditions that can promote it.

        <p>Confronted with extreme levels of dynamic complexity, sustainable organizations respond by imagining, devising, distilling, and applying new ways to act and new contributions to society. When there are rapid changes in context or in opportunities, traditional methods of constructing generative change may not suffice, yet strategic continuity remains important. Agilitywhich implies rapid yet smooth changebecomes crucial. Many theories have tackled this general frontier, but the intersection of HRM theory, strategic agility, paradox theory and improvisation has not been explicitly developed. We discussed how HRM can affect strategic agility through specific activities that will enhance effective improvisation in and by the organization. The six illustrative factors offer crucial opportunities for HR professionals who face environments of rapid and pervasive change. In these settings, organizations do not necessarily have the luxury of observing, reflecting, analyzing, planning and then, and only then, executing key actionsyet much prior HRM strategic analyses has assumed this sequence. The use of a paradox lens, and focus on improvisation reveal their importance for understanding HRM and the creation of strategic agility, while they also highlight promising frontiers for future work.Confronted with extreme levels of dynamic complexity, sustainable organizations respond by imagining, devising, distilling, and applying new ways to act and new contributions to society.
