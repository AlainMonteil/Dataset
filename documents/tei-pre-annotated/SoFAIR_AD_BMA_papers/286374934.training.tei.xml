        <p>Major environmental issues facing our planet are considered to be partly rooted in consumer overconsumption that has resulted from high economic growth. Pro-environmental behaviours (PEBs) have been studied extensively in developed Western countries but more research is needed in developing non-Western countries. Additionally, there are increasing calls for research providing broader theoretical and behavioural explanations of consumers' intentions to adopt PEBs. Therefore, the aim of this research was to examine the factors affecting consumers' PEBs in Saudi Arabia. Quantitative data (n=613) were collected using a survey method. The proposed conceptual model and associated hypotheses were tested using structural equation modelling. The results revealed that consumers' intentions to adopt direct-and indirect-PEBs are affected by innovativeness, materialism, perceived consumer effectiveness, and environmental concern, but not by social influence. Evidence was also found of differences between younger and older respondents. These findings can be used to formulate effective marketing strategies to benefit the environment, society, and sustainable companies in the country.Major environmental issues facing our planet are considered to be partly rooted in consumer overconsumption that has resulted from high economic growth.

        <p>Recent economic growth in developing countries, triggered by technological revolution and globalisation, has led to market-driven growth in consumption patterns and, in turn, to unsustainable consumption. It has been noted that all types of consumption deplete valuable resources (Hüttel, Ziesemer, Peyer, &amp; Balderjahn, 2018) and consumer behaviours -primarily the consumption and disposal of products -affect natural resources (Vermeir &amp; Verbeke, 2006), as what millions of consumers want creates unsustainable demands on these resources and has a significant impact on efforts to protect the environment. However, if a segment of consumers which tends to spend more on environmentally-friendly products is large enough to warrant marketers' attention, an understanding of this segment will become important (Laroche, Bergeron, &amp; Barbaro-Forleo, 2001). Organisations might be encouraged to develop their products to fulfil the needs and wants of environmentally conscious consumers (Pickett-Baker &amp; Ozaki, 2008) and will be more likely to invest their efforts in the development of innovative green technologies and production processes that would lead to greater societal wellbeing (de Medeiros, Duarte Ribeiro, &amp; Cortimiglia, 2014).Recent economic growth in developing countries, triggered by technological revolution and globalisation, has led to market-driven growth in consumption patterns and, in turn, to unsustainable consumption.

        <p>Researchers across the world in the fields of management, marketing, and psychology have begun to show significant interest in consumer behaviour toward the environment and environmental issues (Bamberg, 2003;Bamberg &amp; Möser, 2007;Dietz, Stern, &amp; Guagnano, 1998;Fransson &amp; Garling, 1999;Gleim, Smith, Andrews, &amp; Cronin, 2013;Hüttel et al., 2018;Kapoor &amp; Dwivedi, 2020;Lange &amp; Dewitte, 2019;Steg, Bolderdijk, Keizer, &amp; Perlaviciute, 2014;Steg &amp; Vlek, 2009;Van Liere &amp; Dunlap, 1980). Research has focused particularly on behaviour that has a positive impact on the availability of materials or energy and on behaviour that can positively alter the structure of the ecosystem (de Groot &amp; Steg, 2010;Steg &amp; Vlek, 2009). Efforts have also been made to gain an understanding of the concepts relevant to consumers' pro-environmental behaviours (PEBs) and to further explore the attributes encouraging consumer intention to adopt PEBs (Bamberg, 2003;Carfora, Caso, Sparks, &amp; Conner, 2017;Clark, Mulgrew, Kannis-Dymand, Schaffer, &amp; Hoberg, 2019;Kim &amp; Choi, 2005;Lange &amp; Dewitte, 2019;Laroche et al., 2001;Pickett-Baker &amp; Ozaki, 2008). However, analysis of the existing literature suggests that more theory-based research is needed to enhance current understanding of consumers' intentions to adopt PEBs (de Leeuw, Valois, Ajzen, &amp; Schmidt, 2015) as well as understand concepts relevant to consumers' PEBs in developing countries (de Leeuw et al., 2015;Gleim et al., 2013;Huang, 2016;Hurst, Dittmar, Bond, &amp; Kasser, 2013;Nguyen, Lobo &amp; Nguyen, 2018;Pham, Nguyen, Phan, &amp; Nguyen, 2019;Steg et al., 2014;Strizhakova &amp; Coulter, 2013).Researchers across the world in the fields of management, marketing, and psychology have begun to show significant interest in consumer behaviour toward the environment and environmental issues (Bamberg, 2003;Bamberg &amp; Möser, 2007;Dietz, Stern, &amp; Guagnano, 1998;Fransson &amp; Garling, 1999;Gleim, Smith, Andrews, &amp; Cronin, 2013;Hüttel et al., 2018;Kapoor &amp; Dwivedi, 2020;Lange &amp; Dewitte, 2019;Steg, Bolderdijk, Keizer, &amp; Perlaviciute, 2014;Steg &amp; Vlek, 2009;Van Liere &amp; Dunlap, 1980).

        <p>Saudi Arabia is the largest country in the Middle East, forming a junction between Europe, Asia, and Africa. Following recent fast economic growth in the country, expansion of the population, and threats from climate change, the government of Saudi Arabia is now making efforts to balance its economic growth and environmental challenges to achieve sustainable economic development (Al-Tamimi, 2017). To this end, the government has been trying to reduce the country's dependence on the oil sector and diversify its economy by promoting other sectors including finance, trade, government services, and opening new companies (Samargandi, Fidrmuc, &amp; Ghosh, 2014). To obtain more sustainable economic growth, the Saudi government implemented a new vision for the country -the "2030 Vision"of which the fourth goal is achieving environmental sustainability. The success of the 2030 Vision is widely considered to rest on the active involvement of relevant stakeholders at all levels, and on researchers in different societal contexts to work for the achievement of the three pillars of sustainability (Alshuwaikhat &amp; Mohammed, 2017).Saudi Arabia is the largest country in the Middle East, forming a junction between Europe, Asia, and Africa.

        <p>This study responds to a call by several previous studies (Huang, 2016;Hurst et al., 2013;Kumar, Manrai, &amp; Manrai, 2017;Strizhakova &amp; Coulter, 2013) to achieve an understanding of consumers' PEBs from different cultural perspectives. It examines the factors affecting consumers' adoption of PEBs in the context of Saudi Arabia, thus the findings of this research contribute to existing literature from a non-Western perspective and are practically useful given the context of Saudi Arabia's 2030 Vision. The remainder of the paper is as follows. First, a literature review of research relating to PEBs is undertaken. Then there is a section proposing a conceptual model and research hypotheses for examining factors influencing PEBs in Saudi Arabia. After a section detailing the research methods employed, a further section outlines the findings. The findings are discussed in terms of the theoretical contributions and practical implications before the paper is concluded, outlining limitations and suggesting ideas for further research.This study responds to a call by several previous studies (Huang, 2016;Hurst et al., 2013;Kumar, Manrai, &amp; Manrai, 2017;Strizhakova &amp; Coulter, 2013) to achieve an understanding of consumers' PEBs from different cultural perspectives.

        <p>Three clear clusters of research relating to the environment and consumer behaviour were pinpointed during a review of the literature. The first relates to green purchasing behaviours, defined in previous research as the act of purchasing products that are environmentally beneficial (Nguyen, Lobo, &amp; Greenland, 2016). Numerous studies have focused on green purchasing (Chan, 2001;Gleim et al., 2013;Hsu, Chang, &amp; Yansritakul, 2017;Kim &amp; Choi, 2005;Leonidou, Leonidou, &amp; Kvasova, 2010;Moser, 2015;Pickett-Baker &amp; Ozaki, 2008;Thøgersen, de Barcellos, Perin, &amp; Zhou, 2015;Yazdanpanah &amp; Forouzani, 2015); however, focusing only on purchasing activities ignores other consumer behaviours that impact on solving environmental issues in other ways, for example joining environmental groups and supporting environmental policies (Huang, 2016). Studies focused on green purchasing behaviours tend to assess the use of one product, such as green skincare products (Hsu et al., 2017). It has also been argued that consumers do not seem to show any consistent preference for environmentally-friendly products in their purchase behaviour (Kilbourne &amp; Pickett, 2008). As a result, other research has focused on sustainable consumption (Jansson, 2011;Jansson, Nordlund, &amp; Westin, 2017;Kumar et al., 2017;Leary, Vann, Mittelstaedt, Murphy, &amp; Sherry, 2014;Noppers, Keizer, Bolderdijk, &amp; Steg, 2014;Ozaki, 2011), andPEBs (de Leeuw et al., 2015;Ertz, Karakas, &amp; Sarigöllü, 2016;Huang, 2016;Polonsky, Kilbourne, &amp; Vocino, 2014;Whitmarsh &amp; O'Neill, 2010), both of which constitute the other two identified clusters of research. Sustainable consumption is defined as "behaviour intended to meet the needs of the current generation and benefit the environment without jeopardising the ability of future generations to satisfy their needs" (Leary et al., 2014(Leary et al., , p.1954)). Several studies on sustainable consumption have focused on the adoption of eco-innovative products (Jansson, 2011;Noppers et al., 2014;Ozaki, 2011) and others on the purchase of sustainable products (Kumar et al., 2017;Leary et al., 2014).Three clear clusters of research relating to the environment and consumer behaviour were pinpointed during a review of the literature.

        <p>There has been much research on sustainable consumption designed to understand the elements in an individual's psychology that reflect their sensitivity toward environmental issues and make them keen to save energy, avoid waste, keep the environment clean, and purchase ecological products.There has been much research on sustainable consumption designed to understand the elements in an individual's psychology that reflect their sensitivity toward environmental issues and make them keen to save energy, avoid waste, keep the environment clean, and purchase ecological products.</p>

        <p>The third cluster of research relates to consumers' PEBs. Steg et al. (2014, p.29) define PEBs as "any action that enhances the quality of the environment, either resulting or not resulting from pro-environmental intent". Several studies have shown interest in a broader set of PEBs which include energy conservation, legislation, public policy issues, and social responsibility (de Leeuw et al., 2015;Ertz et al., 2016;Huang, 2016;Polonsky et al., 2014;Whitmarsh &amp; O'Neill, 2010).The third cluster of research relates to consumers' PEBs.

        <p>PEBs have been suggested to have a positive impact on the availability of materials or energy, and could positively alter the structure and dynamics of ecosystems or the biosphere (de Groot &amp; Steg, 2010;Lee, Kim, Kim, &amp; Choi, 2014;Steg &amp; Vlek, 2009). Therefore, several studies have focused on the importance of, and need to better understand, PEBs and investigating factors and motivations underlying these behaviours (Gleim et al., 2013;Polonsky et al., 2014;Strizhakova &amp; Coulter, 2013).PEBs have been suggested to have a positive impact on the availability of materials or energy, and could positively alter the structure and dynamics of ecosystems or the biosphere (de Groot &amp; Steg, 2010;Lee, Kim, Kim, &amp; Choi, 2014;Steg &amp; Vlek, 2009).

        <p>Far exceeding all other areas of the globe, European countries have been the subject of numerous PEBs studies (Bamberg, 2003;Bockarjova &amp; Steg, 2014;de Leeuw et al., 2015;Gatersleben, Murtagh, &amp; Abrahamse, 2014;Harland, Staats, &amp; Wilke, 1999, 2007;Jansson, 2011;Moser, 2015;Noppers et al., 2014;Onwezen, Antonides, &amp; Bartels, 2013;Ozaki &amp; Sevastyanova, 2011;Pickett-Baker &amp; Ozaki, 2008;Vermeir &amp; Verbeke, 2006;Whitmarsh &amp; O'Neill, 2010), followed by the US (Gleim et al., 2013;Kalamas, Cleveland, &amp; Laroche, 2014;Kilbourne &amp; Pickett, 2008;Kim &amp; Choi, 2005) (see Appendix A). A smaller number of PEBs studies have been conducted in China (Chan, 2001;Polonsky et al., 2014;Thøgersen et al., 2015) and Korea (Cho, Thyroff, Rapert, Park, &amp; Lee, 2013;Lee et al., 2014). Despite several studies reporting on PEBs, research has largely been limited to the location of the researchers, hence further research is needed to deepen understanding of the concepts relevant to consumers' PEBs in other geographical contexts and cultural perspectives (Hurst et al., 2013;Strizhakova &amp; Coulter, 2013). As there is very little information related to consumer adoption of PEBs in Saudi Arabia (Abdul-Muhmin, 2007), this research focuses on this context.Far exceeding all other areas of the globe, European countries have been the subject of numerous PEBs studies (Bamberg, 2003;Bockarjova &amp; Steg, 2014;de Leeuw et al., 2015;Gatersleben, Murtagh, &amp; Abrahamse, 2014;Harland, Staats, &amp; Wilke, 1999, 2007;Jansson, 2011;Moser, 2015;Noppers et al., 2014;Onwezen, Antonides, &amp; Bartels, 2013;Ozaki &amp; Sevastyanova, 2011;Pickett-Baker &amp; Ozaki, 2008;Vermeir &amp; Verbeke, 2006;Whitmarsh &amp; O'Neill, 2010), followed by the US (Gleim et al., 2013;Kalamas, Cleveland, &amp; Laroche, 2014;Kilbourne &amp; Pickett, 2008;Kim &amp; Choi, 2005) (see Appendix A).

        <p>In response to the call for more theory-based research when exploring dimensions of PEBs (de Leeuw et al., 2015), relevant theories were reviewed in order to develop a theoretically grounded conceptual model for this study. A review of the extant literature revealed that the most commonly utilised theory by studies in this domain is the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) (Ajzen, 1991) (Appendix A). TPB hypothesises that attitudes, perceived behavioural control, and subjective norms affect behavioural intention and, consequently, behaviour (Ajzen, 2001).

        <p>that TPB provides a framework representing relevant factors affecting individuals' behaviours towards a particular issue and allows exploration of the impact of other contextual variables (Ajzen, 1991). This flexibility has enabled researchers to examine the role of other factors on consumers' PEBs, hence why TPB has become a well-utilised model in the PEBs field (e.g. Bamberg, 2003;Bamberg, Ajzen, &amp; Schmidt, 2003;Carfora et al., 2017;Clark et al., 2019;de Leeuw et al., 2015;Hsu et al., 2017;Kumar et al., 2017;Moser, 2015;Nguyen et al., 2016;Whitmarsh &amp; O'Neill, 2010;Yazdanpanah &amp; Forouzani, 2015). In addition, several studies using TPB to understand consumers' PEBs have found it accounted for variances above 60% (de Leeuw et al., 2015;Moser, 2015;Whitmarsh &amp; O'Neill, 2010;Yazdanpanah &amp; Forouzani, 2015). Therefore, it was decided to employ TPB as the theoretical basis for this research. However, as Fransson &amp; Garling (1999) conceptualised environmental concern as an attitude, this study substitutes 'attitude' with 'environmental concern'. Similarly, 'perceived behavioural control' (PBC) is substituted by 'perceived consumer effectiveness' (PCE), representing the ease or difficulty of positively affecting the environment. Previous research has confirmed the importance of incorporating intention into PEBs models (Bamberg, 2003;Bamberg &amp; Möser, 2007;Chan, 2001;de Leeuw et al., 2015;Fransson &amp; Garling, 1999;Gatersleben et al., 2014;Gleim et al., 2013;Harland et al., 1999;Klöckner, 2013;Kumar et al., 2017;Lee et al., 2014;Minton &amp; Rose, 1997;Nguyen et al., 2016;Onwezen et al., 2013;Polonsky et al., 2014;Vermeir &amp; Verbeke, 2006;Whitmarsh &amp; O'Neill, 2010), so the construct of behavioural intention was at the centre of this study's model.that TPB provides a framework representing relevant factors affecting individuals' behaviours towards a particular issue and allows exploration of the impact of other contextual variables (Ajzen, 1991).

        <p>The model was extended with 'materialism' and 'innovativeness'. To date, few studies have investigated the influence of values with a negative effect, such as materialism, on PEBs. However, it has been noted that consumers with highly materialistic values, such as those in fast-growth economies, might have little concern for the environment and environmental issues (Polonsky et al., 2014). On the other hand, it has been suggested that incorporating innovativeness into PEBs models can help with understanding consumers' early adoption behaviours (Jansson, 2011), which is relevant given the newness of the concept of PEBs in Saudi Arabia (Alam, Almotairi, &amp; Gaadar, 2012).The model was extended with 'materialism' and 'innovativeness'.

        <p>Environmental concern is "a general attitude toward specific pro-environmental behaviour" (Fransson &amp; Garling, 1999, p.3798), and considered "an affective attribute that can represent a person's worries, compassion, likes and dislikes about the environment" (Lee, 2009, p.88). The effect of environmental concern on behavioural intention has accumulated significant support in the PEBs context (Bamberg, 2003;Felix, Hinsch, Rauschnabel, &amp; Schlegelmilch, 2018) Lee, Kim, Kim, &amp; Choi, 2014;Polonsky et al., 2014), with the majority of studies having found it to be the most significant predictor of behavioural intention (Bamberg, 2003;de Groot &amp; L. Steg, 2008;Felix et al., 2018;Kilbourne &amp; Pickett, 2008;Kollmuss &amp; Agyeman, 2002;Lee et al., 2014;Polonsky et al., 2014;Vermeir &amp; Verbeke, 2006). The majority of prominent studies have concluded that environmental concern is a main factor in PEBs models, as it could provide valuable information about consumers' intentions to adopt PEBs (Bamberg, 2003;de Groot &amp; Steg, 2008;Lee et al., 2014;Polonsky et al., 2014;Schultz &amp; Zelezny, 1999; Vermeir &amp; Verbeke, 2006), and assist understanding why individuals intend to engage in PEBs (Felix et al., 2018;Kilbourne &amp; Pickett, 2008;Polonsky et al., 2014;Straughan &amp; Roberts, 1999). Therefore, environmental concern is a critical component in PEBs models, and future research should consider it in their models (Polonsky et al., 2014). Taking the above into consideration, the following is hypothesised: H1. Environmental concern has a positive effect on behavioural intention.Environmental concern is "a general attitude toward specific pro-environmental behaviour" (Fransson &amp; Garling, 1999, p.3798), and considered "an affective attribute that can represent a person's worries, compassion, likes and dislikes about the environment" (Lee, 2009, p.88).

        <p>Materialism has been defined as "a set of values, goals or expectancies relating to the acquisition of wealth and material goods" (Hurst et al., 2013, p.257). It is argued that such values might affect a wide range of attitudes, beliefs, norms, intentions, and behaviours (Schultz &amp; Zelezny, 1999;Steg et al., 2014;Stern, 2000). Materialistic values are growing in developing countries as consumers imitate patterns of Western consumption and lifestyles (Kilbourne &amp; Pickett, 2008). It has been found that consumers with highly materialistic values purchase products in search of a sense of identity, happiness, self-image, and social recognition or status (Nepomuceno &amp; Laroche, 2015;Richins, 2004;Tsang, Carpenter, Roberts, Frisch, &amp; Carlisle, 2014). Consumers who gain satisfaction and happiness through acquisition and consumption are more self-centred and less likely to be fulfilled by engaging in environmental activities in comparison to consumers who do not value purchasing goods (Kilbourne &amp; Pickett, 2008). To date, few studies have investigated the influence of values with a negative effect, such as materialism, on PEBs. Previous research investigated the relationship between materialism and PEBs but ignored the importance of behavioural intentions. Most of these relationships between materialism and PEBs were mediated by variables such as consumers' attitudes (Hurst et al., 2013;Hynes &amp; Wilson, 2016), environmental beliefs (Kilbourne &amp; Pickett, 2008), environmental concern (Polonsky et al., 2014), and environmentally-friendly tendencies (Strizhakova &amp; Coulter, 2013). Therefore, it is important to investigate the direct effect of materialism on behavioural intentions to adopt PEBs. It is also important to investigate this relationship because materialism is frequently suggested as an influential factor affecting consumers to adopt higher consumption patterns (Hurst et al., 2013;Kilbourne &amp; Pickett, 2008;Polonsky et al., 2014), which potentially conflicts with the notion of environmental consumption (Kilbourne &amp; Pickett, 2008).

        <p>Despite this, the role of innovativeness on the adoption of PEBs has received little examination in the literature. Innovativeness has been described as an "internal drive or motivating strength" (Roehrich, 2004, p.672). This research adopts Roehrich's (2004) conceptualisation, which expresses two central needs for adopting new products: the need for uniqueness and the need for stimulation. It is suggested that marketing of eco-innovations could focus on general innovators, early adopters and opinion leaders in the market rather than only on traditional green consumers (Jansson, 2011;Thøgersen et al., 2010). Consumers who search for and adopt new products have been noted in several studies as socially active opinion leaders who usually adopt new products and spread the word about them (Jansson et al., 2017), behaviours characteristic of both direct-and indirect-PEBs.Despite this, the role of innovativeness on the adoption of PEBs has received little examination in the literature.

        <p>Social influence refers to "the perceived social pressure to perform or not perform a given behaviour" (Ajzen, 1991, p.188). Social pressures may emanate from those who are important to an individual, including close friends, relatives, colleagues and business partners (Paul, Modi, &amp; Patel, 2016). Fear of social exclusion is viewed as a primary motive for why people tend to fulfil social norms (Bamberg &amp; Möser, 2007). Several studies in the PEBs field have suggested a significant impact of social influence on consumer behavioural intentions to adopt PEBs (Bamberg, 2003;de Leeuw et al., 2015;Gatersleben et al., 2014;Gleim et al., 2013;Hsu et al., 2017;Hynes &amp; Wilson, 2016;Klöckner, 2013;Minton &amp; Rose, 1997;Nguyen et al., 2016;Vermeir &amp; Verbeke, 2006;Whitmarsh &amp; O'Neill, 2010), calling for further examination of the influence of different contextual factors to understand consumers' PEBs (Gleim et al., 2013;Huang, 2016;Kumar et al., 2017;Strizhakova &amp; Coulter, 2013).Social influence refers to "the perceived social pressure to perform or not perform a given behaviour" (Ajzen, 1991, p.188).

        <p>In collectivist cultures, behaviours are often driven by social norms (Leonidou et al., 2010), and individuals in such cultures are likely to be motivated by social comparison and imitation of their peers. An individual's demand for organic products, for example, could be influenced by another's demand for the same products (Hynes &amp; Wilson, 2016). Therefore, social influence is considered an especially critical factor in changing purchasing patterns and encouraging PEBs in predominantly collectivist cultures (Hynes &amp; Wilson, 2016;Vermeir &amp; Verbeke, 2006). Saudi behaviours are heavily driven by social norms (Al-Kandari &amp; Gaither, 2011), although some studies have shown surprising results in two other collectivist cultures -India and Iran -revealing a non-significant relationship between social norms and consumers' behavioural intention (Kumar et al., 2017;Yazdanpanah &amp; Forouzani, 2015). However, the majority of studies considering social influence as a factor in consumers' behavioural intentions to adopt PEBs have found its effect to be significant (Bamberg, 2003;de Leeuw et al., 2015;Hynes &amp; Wilson, 2016;Onwezen et al., 2013;Vermeir &amp; Verbeke, 2006;Whitmarsh &amp; O'Neill, 2010).

        <p>PCE is defined "as a domain-specific belief that the efforts of an individual can make a difference in the solution to a problem" (Ellen, Wiener, &amp; Cobbwalgren, 1991, p.103). It has also been defined as an individual-specific belief that "examine[s] the extent to which any one consumer can have an impact on the environment" (Gilg, Barr, &amp; Ford, 2005, p.484). To motivate behavioural change, consumers need to be convinced that their behaviours have an influence on the environment and an impact on solving environmental issues. It is believed that PCE can significantly contribute to predicting individuals' intentions to adopt environmental behaviours (Ellen et al., 1991;Gleim et al., 2013), as consumers with a strong belief that their environmentally-conscious behaviours can have a positive effect on the environment will be more likely to engage in PEBs (Gleim et al., 2013).PCE is defined "as a domain-specific belief that the efforts of an individual can make a difference in the solution to a problem" (Ellen, Wiener, &amp; Cobbwalgren, 1991, p.103).

        <p>It has been argued that if individuals believe that environmental issues must be solved, this belief must influence their behavioural intentions to adopt the actual behaviour. Studies have found that in the consumer context, PCE had a significant effect on behavioural intention (Bockarjova &amp; Steg, 2014;Cho et al., 2013;Gleim et al., 2013;Kim, 2011;Lee et al., 2014;Vermeir &amp; Verbeke, 2006).It has been argued that if individuals believe that environmental issues must be solved, this belief must influence their behavioural intentions to adopt the actual behaviour.

        <p>Individuals' perception of the effectiveness of their efforts to contribute to solving a given problem can help explain their decisions and behaviours (Lee et al., 2014).

Therefore, the following can be hypothesised:</p>
        <p>Behavioural intention refers to the perceived likelihood of performing the behaviour, rather than doing the behaviour (Ajzen, 1991). For decades, behavioural intention has been used to predict behaviours in many fields of research, including marketing and psychology (Venkatesh, Maruping, &amp; Brown, 2006). Importantly, behavioural intention is one of the most-used factors in consumers' PEBs studies (Bamberg, 2003;Bamberg &amp; Möser, 2007;de Leeuw et al., 2015;Gatersleben et al., 2014;Gleim et al., 2013;Klöckner, 2013;Kumar et al., 2017;Polonsky et al., 2014;Whitmarsh &amp; O'Neill, 2010). Several studies have confirmed the importance of incorporating behavioural intention in PEBs models, as it helps in understanding consumers' PEBs (Bamberg &amp; Möser, 2007;de Leeuw et al., 2015;Gleim et al., 2013;Onwezen et al., 2013;Polonsky et al., 2014). Previous studies have noted that self-reported environmental behaviours are problematic, but when behavioural intentions increase, self-reported behaviours also increase (Polonsky et al., 2014).Behavioural intention refers to the perceived likelihood of performing the behaviour, rather than doing the behaviour (Ajzen, 1991).

        <p>PEBs can be divided into two dimensions: direct and indirect. Direct-PEBs relate to behaviours that directly affect the environment, including purchasing organic products, reducing consumption, and recycling (de Leeuw et al., 2015;Nguyen, Lobo, &amp; Greenland, 2016;Whitmarsh &amp; O'Neill, 2010). Indirect-PEBs focus on behaviours which have an indirect impact on the environment, such as supporting environmental organisations or participating in environmental groups and protests (Ertz et al., 2016;Polonsky et al., 2014). Not all PEBs studies include both constructs but Polonsky et al. (2014) found that indirect-PEBs have a significant positive effect on consumers' adoption of direct-PEBs. Direct-PEBs have immediate effects on the environment and indirect-PEBs lead to later effects (Stern, 2000) but both play an important role in benefitting the environment, society, and solving the environmental issues (Huang, 2016;Polonsky et al., 2014). There is still a gap in understanding consumers' intentions to adopt different dimensions of PEBs and more theory-based research is needed (de Leeuw et al., 2015).PEBs can be divided into two dimensions: direct and indirect.

        <p>It is argued that there are different types of PEBs, and each type might be subject to different influences (Ertz et al., 2016;Kilbourne &amp; Pickett, 2008;Polonsky et al., 2014;Stern, 2000). This study adopted two-dimensions of PEBs in line with several studies in the PEBs context (e.g. Huang, 2016;Kilbourne &amp; Pickett, 2008;Polonsky et al., 2014).

Several studies have used these recommendations (e.g. Ertz et al., 2016;Huang, 2016;Kilbourne &amp; Pickett, 2008;Polonsky et al., 2014), and confirmed the distinction between direct-PEBs and indirect-PEBs.It is argued that there are different types of PEBs, and each type might be subject to different influences (Ertz et al., 2016;Kilbourne &amp; Pickett, 2008;Polonsky et al., 2014;Stern, 2000).

        <p>As direct-and indirect-PEBs are closely related, it can be suggested that the path from indirect to direct behaviours will be positive, as those who participate in environmental activities are more likely to adopt proactive PEBs.

        <p>It is suggested that young consumers represent a powerful engine in the development of environmentally conscious population (Nguyen, Lobo &amp; Nguyen, 2018). It is also suggested that younger generations are more concerned about environmental quality since solutions to certain environmental issues require changes to traditional values, habitual behaviours, and threats to the existing social order (Van Liere &amp; Dunlap, 1980). On the other hand, older generations might not accept changes in their habits or purchasing behaviours as it might affect their values or social order. Moreover, research demonstrates that younger generations are more willing to accept new ideas than older ones (Ottman, Stafford, &amp; Hartman, 2006). It is also noted that the involvement of younger generations in environmental problems can result from continued exposure to information on environmental issues via the media, which facilitates the development of an ecology-minded generation to commit to solving environmental issues as they move into adulthood (Van Liere &amp; Dunlap, 1980). It has been suggested that younger generations are more environmentally concerned (Fransson &amp; Garling, 1999;Nguyen et al., 2018). However, studies have found that older generations are more environmentally concerned than younger generations and that younger generations are more concerned about materialistic values rather than caring about others or saving the environment (Gilg et al., 2005;Liu, Vedlitz, &amp; Shi, 2014;Whitmarsh &amp; O'Neill, 2010). These diverse findings concerning the role of age suggest an additional need for exploratory research in explaining the role of age related to intentions to adopt PEBs. Research has found that it is essential that consumers' PEBs are studied from a variety of perspectives in order to acquire a holistic insight (Stern, 2000), and it is noted that little is known on factors influencing consumers PEBs in Saudi Arabia (Abdul-Muhmin, 2007). Given the limited research to date, on the influence of age as a moderator in PEBs research this study attempts to explore the differences in antecedents of adoption of direct and indirect-PEBs. It is proposed that: H9.

        <p>In the previous section a number of hypotheses were proposed taking into account existing findings; therefore, a positivist and deductive approach was the most appropriate for this study (Bryman &amp; Bell, 2007). Given that existing measurement scales for the constructs identified in section 3 were available, and in order to statistically test the stated hypotheses and evaluate the effect of each research construct on consumers' intentions to adopt direct-and indirect-PEBs, it was decided to implement a survey questionnaire, which has been the predominant data collection method across quantitative PEBs adoption research (e.g Cho et al., 2013;Fransson &amp; Garling, 1999;Hsu et al., 2017;Huang, 2016;Kilbourne &amp; Pickett, 2008;Kim &amp; Choi, 2005;Kumar et al., 2017;Polonsky et al., 2014;Van Liere &amp; Dunlap, 1980;Whitmarsh &amp; O'Neill, 2010;Yazdanpanah &amp; Forouzani, 2015). Although online surveys may exclude those in the target population without internet access, the benefits of geographical reach and reduction of social desirability bias from a self-completion approach (Bhattacherjee, 2012;Zikmund et al., 2013) led to adoption of an online approach.In the previous section a number of hypotheses were proposed taking into account existing findings; therefore, a positivist and deductive approach was the most appropriate for this study (Bryman &amp; Bell, 2007).

        <p>The questionnaire was developed in English and Arabic, professionally translated using standard back-translation protocol (e.g. Leonidou et al., 2010;Polonsky et al., 2014;Strizhakova &amp; Coulter, 2013). It included measurement items based on a review of previous research (Appendix B) and demographic questions. When deciding to use Likert scales, it is important to consider the number of points to be utilised, making sure that the same number of points are used on all measurement scales in order to successfully conduct structural equation modelling (SEM) (Hair, Anderson, Babin, &amp; Black, 2010). Researchers have noted that using a five-point, rather than a seven-point (or more), scale leads to a lower percentage of missing responses (Weijters et al., 2010) and it has also been found that both five-and seven-point Likert scales produce the same mean scores when rescaled, with levels of skewness unaffected (Dawes, 2008). Therefore, measurement items were measured using a five-point Likert scale. This is also in line with several existing studies (for example, Dwivedi et al., 2013;Kapoor et al., 2014;Kim et al., 2009;Liu et al., 2020;Shareef et al., 2016;2017;Sharma &amp; Sharma, 2019) that have successfully utilised five-point Likert scale.The questionnaire was developed in English and Arabic, professionally translated using standard back-translation protocol (e.g. Leonidou et al., 2010;Polonsky et al., 2014;Strizhakova &amp; Coulter, 2013).

        <p>The sample therefore relates to Saudi consumers, so the target population was determined to be those who usually live in Saudi Arabia or consider themselves to be Saudi citizens. Previous research has identified that focusing on diverse levels of education, income, age, and gender groups can offer more insight in terms of understanding who may be more willing to consider PEBs (Chan, 2001;Cho et al., 2013;Dermondy et al., 2015;Gilg et al., 2005;Gleim et al., 2013;Polonsky et al., 2014;Whitmarsh &amp; O'Neill, 2010); however, for ethical reasons, only those over the age of 18 were included in the target population.The sample therefore relates to Saudi consumers, so the target population was determined to be those who usually live in Saudi Arabia or consider themselves to be Saudi citizens.

        <p>Due to the lack of reliable sampling frame, convenience and snowball sampling techniques were utilised to facilitate timely completion of the research. The researchers had access to two higher education institutions in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, a link to the anonymous survey was distributed electronically at these two institutions. The anonymous survey link was also distributed using different online forums and social network sites. Following a similar process as other studies (e.g. Koenig-Lewis et al., 2014;Polonsky et al., 2014;Strizhakova &amp; Coulter, 2013), each participant was asked to send an invitation to the anonymous survey to members of their social groups, including family and friends, to reach a broader range of respondents. A two-month time frame was allocated to collect a minimum of 300 responses for this study.Due to the lack of reliable sampling frame, convenience and snowball sampling techniques were utilised to facilitate timely completion of the research.

        <p>SEM was preferred to use in this study as it enables testing of hypothesised relationships between multiple variables simultaneously, allowing for both latent and observed variables to be analysed at the same time (Gefen, Straub, &amp; Boudreau, 2000). SEM is also able to take into account measurement errors of the observed variables to be analysed as an integral part of the model (Gefen et al., 2000;Hair et al., 2010). Moreover, the majority of consumers' PEBs studies have used it to analyse their data (Bamberg et al., 2003;Cho et al., 2013;de Leeuw et al., 2015;Gleim et al., 2013;Huang, 2016;Kilbourne &amp; Pickett, 2008;Kim &amp; Choi, 2005;Leonidou et al., 2010;Polonsky et al., 2014;Strizhakova &amp; Coulter, 2013;Yazdanpanah &amp; Forouzani, 2015).

        <p>Statistics available from the online survey platform revealed that 856 surveys were started and 243 potential respondents were screened out due to not meeting the eligibility criteria. Therefore, a total of 613 eligible responses were counted in the sample for further analysis. In total 611 fully completed responses remained in the sample after cleaning and screening of the data. Almost 80% of the respondents were female (Table 1). The age group '56 or over' saw the fewest respondents; most were in the '26-35' age group. More than 50% of the respondents held a Bachelor's degree, with a further 18.7% educated to Master's degree level. Nearly half of the respondents declared that they had an income of SR 8000 or more but 105 respondents chose to select the 'prefer not to say' response to this question. To explore the items selected for this study, measured with a Likert scale anchored by 1 'strongly disagree' to 5 'strongly agree', it was observed that all combined constructs measuring environmental concern, perceived consumer effectiveness (PCE) and materialism had mean values greater than 3.0. Further, intentions and both direct-and indirect-PEBs were measured with a Likert scale anchored by 1 'never' to 5 'always', and the combined construct mean of behavioural intention was also higher than 3.0, whereas the mean values of the combined constructs measuring direct and indirect-PEBs, innovativeness, and social influence were smaller than 3.0. The mean values of the environmental concern items ranged from 3.78 (EC3) to 4.43 (EC2).

        <p>An assessment of path coefficients (Table 4) revealed that environmental concern, materialism, innovativeness, and PCE all significantly affected behavioural intention, thus confirming H1, H2, H3, and H5 respectively. Social influence did not significantly predict behavioural intention, hence H4 was rejected. Behavioural intention significantly predicted both direct-PEBs and indirect-PEBs, supporting H6 and H7. Finally, indirect-PEBs was found to be a significant predictor of direct-PEBs, confirming H8. The results showed that innovativeness was the strongest predictor of behavioural intention. The significant constructs explained 38% of variance in behavioural intention, 65% of variance in direct-PEBs, and 30% of variance in indirect-PEBs.

Measurement invariance was tested to ensure any between-group differences could be unambiguously interpreted (Cheung &amp; Rensvold, 2002) and was established following the release of constraints on items PCE2, PEBs7 and INV2.

The results of hypotheses testing have revealed some support for TPB in the context of PEBs in terms of the role of attitudes (environmental concern) and PBC (perceived consumer effectiveness) in affecting intention, as well as supporting the effect of intention on behaviour. However, no support was found for the effect of social influence on intention, contrary to other studies in the area that have utilised TPB (e.g. Bamberg, 2003;Carfora et al., 2017;de Leeuw et al., 2015;Hsu et al., 2017;Nguyen et al., 2016;Whitmarsh &amp; O'Neill, 2010).This study employed and extended TPB to examine the factors affecting consumers' intentions to adopt direct-and indirect-PEBs in the context of Saudi Arabia.

        <p>The results of this research have answered several academic calls for more up-to-date research on the impact of contextual factors on consumer PEBs (Huang, 2016;Steg et al., 2014;Steg &amp; Vlek, 2009), as well as exploring the attributes and motivations encouraging consumers to adopt PEBs (Ertz et al., 2016;Hurst et al., 2013;Polonsky et al., 2014;Strizhakova &amp; Coulter, 2013). The conceptual model of this study aimed to identify factors affecting consumers' intentions to adopt direct-and indirect-PEBs in the context of Saudi Arabia. The results of this research have confirmed the relevance of both materialism and innovativeness as extensions to the TPB, which offers a further theoretical contribution. A key theoretical contribution of this study lies in finding evidence that innovativeness has a significant direct effect on behavioural intention to adopt directand indirect-PEBs in Saudi Arabia. In this study, innovativeness as an influencing factor had the strongest effect of all the factors included, yet previous research did not take it into account. AsThe results of this research have answered several academic calls for more up-to-date research on the impact of contextual factors on consumer PEBs (Huang, 2016;Steg et al., 2014;Steg &amp; Vlek, 2009), as well as exploring the attributes and motivations encouraging consumers to adopt PEBs (Ertz et al., 2016;Hurst et al., 2013;Polonsky et al., 2014;Strizhakova &amp; Coulter, 2013). The conceptual model of this study aimed to identify factors affecting consumers' intentions to adopt direct-and indirect-PEBs in the context of Saudi Arabia.

        <p>PEBs is considered a new concept to Saudi consumers (Alam et al., 2012), it could be suggested that innovativeness can help in understanding early adoption of PEBs. It can also be suggested that the construct of innovativeness should be considered if the concept of PEBs is new for consumers in a particular context, which provides fruitful avenues for future research.PEBs is considered a new concept to Saudi consumers (Alam et al., 2012), it could be suggested that innovativeness can help in understanding early adoption of PEBs.

        <p>In addition to innovativeness, the significant effect of materialism provides evidence that using materialism as an extension to the TPB is also important in the context of this study. Previous studies in the PEBs area have investigated the influence of materialism on consumers' intentions to adopt PEBs, in this study materialism was looked at as a value, given that several studies have confirmed the influence of values on consumers' intentions to adopt PEBs (Kollmuss &amp; Agyeman, 2002;Nguyen et al., 2016). The results of this research confirmed the negative effect of materialistic values on consumers' intentions to adopt PEBs, an important finding considering the increasing levels of materialism in developing countries (Ger &amp; Belk, 1996;Polonsky et al., 2014).In addition to innovativeness, the significant effect of materialism provides evidence that using materialism as an extension to the TPB is also important in the context of this study.

        <p>The results of this research provide evidence that targeting values, particularly materialistic values, is important to understand consumers' intentions to adopt PEBs in developing countries with fast economic growth. Materialism is considered a significant factor contributing to higher consumption, which potentially conflicts with the notion of sustainable consumption and PEBs (Hurst et al., 2013;Kilbourne &amp; Pickett, 2008). The results of this research confirmed this conflict between environmental concern and materialism, which is worth exploring in other developing economies in further research. Additionally, in the context of this research, environmental concern was more important than other factors, as increasing levels of concern among consumers would be impactful in terms of changing their environmental behaviours (Bamberg, 2003;Kilbourne &amp; Pickett, 2008;Polonsky et al., 2014). It was also confirmed that consumers in Saudi Arabia have high levels of concern towards the environment and solving environmental issues, as this construct was the second strongest factor after innovativeness in the model of this study, which might result in more environmental behaviours in the future. This suggests that including environmental concern in future models can provide fruitful results.The results of this research provide evidence that targeting values, particularly materialistic values, is important to understand consumers' intentions to adopt PEBs in developing countries with fast economic growth.

        <p>A key theoretical contribution of this study lies in finding evidence that PCE affects consumers in Saudi Arabia differently from consumers in other geographical contexts. Several studies in the PEBs context conducted in Western countries found PCE to be an important component in their models, having a strong effect on consumers' intentions to adopt PEBs (Antonetti &amp; Maklan, 2014;Cho et al., 2013;Gleim et al., 2013;Lee et al., 2014). However, the influence of PCE was not as strong in this study as in these previous studies. PCE represents individuals' specific beliefs around the extent to which their efforts can make a difference in the solution to a problem (Ellen et al., 1991), thus in this context it was proposed that consumers would be more likely to adopt PEBs when they feel that their efforts will make a difference in solving environmental issues (Antonetti &amp; Maklan, 2014;Kim &amp; Choi, 2005;Vermeir &amp; Verbeke, 2006). Due to the collectivist culture of Saudi Arabia, consumers may feel their efforts as individuals cannot make a difference to such large-scale problems, so the significant effect of PCE was not strong in this study. As this result is different from the findings of previous studies, this can be a call for investigating influencing factors in the context of this study to understand what could influence consumers to adopt PEBs in Saudi Arabia.A key theoretical contribution of this study lies in finding evidence that PCE affects consumers in Saudi Arabia differently from consumers in other geographical contexts.

        <p>Several studies in the PEBs context have been conducted in Western countries that found the effect of social influence to be significant (Bamberg, 2003;Carfora et al., 2017;de Leeuw et al., 2015;Gleim et al., 2013;Hynes &amp; Wilson, 2016;Whitmarsh &amp; O'Neill, 2010). However, the results of this research revealed that social influence does not have a significant effect on individuals' behavioural intentions in the context of Saudi Arabia. Due to Saudi Arabia's collectivist culture and previous research suggesting that consumers in such cultures are more likely to be influenced by social influence, this construct was expected to have a strong positive effect (Leonidou et al., 2010). Social influence being non-significant in the context of this study might be related to the recent changes occurring in Saudi Arabia due to rapid development and economic growth, which might affect how Saudi consumers think and how they are influenced. Exploring how the culture is changing alongside fast economic growth could be an interesting avenue for future research.Several studies in the PEBs context have been conducted in Western countries that found the effect of social influence to be significant (Bamberg, 2003;Carfora et al., 2017;de Leeuw et al., 2015;Gleim et al., 2013;Hynes &amp; Wilson, 2016;Whitmarsh &amp; O'Neill, 2010).

        <p>Additionally, this finding may be a result of the low level of information about PEBs among a large segment of consumers in Saudi Arabia, as the concept of PEBs is new there (Alam et al., 2012).Additionally, this finding may be a result of the low level of information about PEBs among a large segment of consumers in Saudi Arabia, as the concept of PEBs is new there (Alam et al., 2012).</p>

        <p>A large proportion of research in the PEBs context has not taken into account the importance of the effect of both direct-and indirect-PEBs on consumers' behavioural intentions. The majority of studies have focused on PEBs in general, particularly one-dimension PEBs. Research has suggested that it is more appropriate to differentiate dimensions of PEBs (Ertz et al., 2016;Huang, 2016;Kilbourne &amp; Pickett, 2008;Polonsky et al., 2014) as both direct-and indirect-PEBs can have a significant influence on protecting natural resources (Huang &amp; Rust, 2011;Polonsky et al., 2014).A large proportion of research in the PEBs context has not taken into account the importance of the effect of both direct-and indirect-PEBs on consumers' behavioural intentions.

        <p>Finally, the literature review revealed that few studies have been conducted in developing countries, particularly the Middle East, compared to developed countries. Research within different geographical contexts has largely been limited to the location of the researchers; only one existing PEBs adoption study has been undertaken in Saudi Arabia. As this country is an important market due to its wealth and rapid economic growth, it is vital to explore geographical differences in PEBs and marketing research. PEBs have been studied by far the most extensively in developed Western countries (e.g. Hurst et al., 2013;Kilbourne &amp; Pickett, 2008;Kollmuss &amp; Agyeman, 2002;Strizhakova &amp; Coulter, 2013). Research is needed in countries with different economic, cultural, political, and legal settings (Leonidou et al., 2010), so the examination of factors affecting adoption of PEBs in Saudi Arabia is an important theoretical offering. Therefore, this research offers new insight into the complexity of consumer PEBs.Finally, the literature review revealed that few studies have been conducted in developing countries, particularly the Middle East, compared to developed countries.

        <p>The design and marketing of environmentally-friendly products and services should improve to help increase consumers' intentions to adopt PEBs in Saudi Arabia and support the acceptance of PEBs in the country. As successful business models cannot be directly imported to different cultural contexts, the results of this study provide stakeholders and managers with an understanding of the needs of Saudi consumers and how consumers in Saudi Arabia might be influenced to adopt PEBs so they can formulate more competitive strategies.The design and marketing of environmentally-friendly products and services should improve to help increase consumers' intentions to adopt PEBs in Saudi Arabia and support the acceptance of PEBs in the country.

        <p>The non-significant impact of social influence on purchase intention could be a new insight into a collectivist culture like Saudi Arabia. As the concept of PEBs is new in the context of Saudi Arabia (Alam et al., 2012), the lack of significance in the result of social influence might be due to low level of information about PEBs among consumers in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, marketers might focus on developing their communication activities to enhance knowledge about adopting PEBs and the consequences of not adopting these behaviours. Retailers may have to reconsider the ways they traditionally communicate and move toward new methods of managing marketing activities to best target the collectivist nature of Saudi consumers. For example, it has been suggested that social media has managed to transform the way internet users communicate and interact with each other, and consumers use social media channels to discover and learn about new products and brands. This process has been found to be enjoyable for consumers so marketers could consider the positive effect of innovativeness, or searching for new environmentally-friendly products over social media channels, to utilise the feeling of pleasure associated with discovering new things. As many consumers in Saudi Arabia utilise social media to evaluate products, their opinion may depend highly on how others evaluate them. Therefore, it may be beneficial to examine how different types of social media can be leveraged for marketing of environmentally-friendly products in future research.The non-significant impact of social influence on purchase intention could be a new insight into a collectivist culture like Saudi Arabia.

        <p>The results of this study found that the strongest significant effect on behavioural intention to adopt PEBs was innovativeness. As novelty-seeking is an internal drive that motivates individuals to discover new products before others do (Roehrich, 2004), PEBs are perceived as new and uncommon, a consumer's tendency to be innovative would affect their intentions to engage in PEBs. Therefore, in order to motivate consumers to adopt behavioural change in Saudi Arabia, retailers and marketers need to ensure that their policies and marketing plans take this factor into account. It has been argued that novelty-seeking consumers are more likely to be interested in discovering new products and related studies suggest that consumers make environmentallyfriendly choices more willingly towards new, innovative products (Jansson, 2011;Osburg et al., 2016). Since the concept of PEBs is new in the context of Saudi Arabia (Alam et al., 2012), marketers and planners need to focus on this and try to communicate how PEBs can be useful for both individuals and society, which may encourage intentions to adopt both direct-and indirect-PEBs. Marketers could focus on opinion leaders in the market rather than only on general consumers, and examination of this could be a fruitful avenue for future research.The results of this study found that the strongest significant effect on behavioural intention to adopt PEBs was innovativeness.

        <p>Given the significant effect of PCE on PEBs in Saudi Arabia, developers could design campaigns to show individuals that their behaviours have an influence on the environment, and an impact on solving environmental issues. They could provide information in campaigns about how the conservation efforts of one person can make a difference even if they think that other people refuse to contribute. Moreover, policymakers seeking to encourage voluntary PEBs should try to enhance consumer perceptions that their own actions will improve the environment (Ellen, Wiener, &amp; Cobb-Walgren, 1991). Marketers, through their communication activities, could provide information for voluntary participants that if they take actions by participating in environmental groups to mitigate global warming problems, others could be persuaded to change their behaviours to mitigate global warming.Given the significant effect of PCE on PEBs in Saudi Arabia, developers could design campaigns to show individuals that their behaviours have an influence on the environment, and an impact on solving environmental issues.

        <p>Policymakers must address the consequences of resource over-consumption at both systemic and individual levels, or severe, long-term environmental problems will occur (Kilbourne &amp; Pickett, 2008), and to improve PEBs among consumers they need to enhance consumer concern (Polonsky et al., 2014). For those who are already environmentally concerned, an emphasis on the success they can achieve by considering PEBs might be effective for promoting ecological purchase and consumption (Bamberg, 2003). Marketers need to focus on consumers' satisfaction rather than the acquisition of physical goods, so consumers can be persuaded to acquire happiness and success without material possessions. Consequently, they could target materialistic consumers with customised socially desirable environmentally-friendly products, and with reclaimed products positioned as exclusive bespoke pieces. Policymakers can also satisfy materialistic values while reusing materials and presenting the image of being green as a new trend. Targeting consumers in this way could provide several benefits for companies in Saudi Arabia. Thus, this study provides important implications for retailers exploring opportunities in Saudi Arabia.Policymakers must address the consequences of resource over-consumption at both systemic and individual levels, or severe, long-term environmental problems will occur (Kilbourne &amp; Pickett, 2008), and to improve PEBs among consumers they need to enhance consumer concern (Polonsky et al., 2014).

        <p>This research is not without limitations but those identified in this section may provide important inspiration for future research. Although it was checked statistically, there may still be an issue with the self-reported behavioural measures. This has been a concern and considered as a limitation in previous studies (de Leeuw et al., 2015;Kumar et al., 2017;Polonsky et al., 2014). This was considered as an issue, as participants may have overestimated the extent of their socially desirable behaviours (de Leeuw et al., 2015), and researchers cannot guarantee the true behaviours of the respondents, due to the sensitive nature of the topic, because respondents may be tempted to modify their responses so as to fit a more 'socially acceptable' mode (Gleim et al., 2013). Therefore, future research should be based on actual purchasing data rather than self-reported data in order to avoid biases that maybe introduced by consumers via their self-reported behaviours (Gleim et al., 2013;Moser, 2015). As it would be difficult to obtain data relating to actual behaviour for the wide variety of behaviours investigated in this study, an attempt was made to minimize such biases by assuring the participants that their responses were anonymous.This research is not without limitations but those identified in this section may provide important inspiration for future research.

        <p>The non-significant effect of social influence in the collectivist context of this study can be considered a call for research examining alternative contextual factors that might influence consumers' intentions to adopt PEBs during times of fast cultural and economic change. An interesting example would be an investigation of the role of media use or media applications, as has been highlighted in recent studies (Huang, 2016;Hynes &amp; Wilson, 2016), these studies have found its effect to be significant. Another important contextual construct could be the influence of environmental advertising on consumers' intentions to adopt PEBs, which also received scant attention in previous studies (Ertz et al., 2016).The non-significant effect of social influence in the collectivist context of this study can be considered a call for research examining alternative contextual factors that might influence consumers' intentions to adopt PEBs during times of fast cultural and economic change.

        <p>This study found innovativeness to have the greatest influence on consumers' behavioural intentions to adopt PEBs, so focusing on the influence of innovativeness is vital to understand consumers' intentions to adopt PEBs. Future research could focus on opinion leaders in the market rather than focusing only on general consumers. It is recommended that campaigners should focus on the early adopters segment in their initial campaigns, as these consumers might spread the information to others. Only limited information related to innovativeness is available in the literature in the PEBs context, so future studies could utilize a qualitative approach for a more comprehensive understanding of the effect of this construct on PEBs.This study found innovativeness to have the greatest influence on consumers' behavioural intentions to adopt PEBs, so focusing on the influence of innovativeness is vital to understand consumers' intentions to adopt PEBs.

        <p>Due to the time and costs involved in longitudinal research, a cross-sectional approach was adopted in this study. Using this approach helped to better understand PEBs, as this context is relatively new in Saudi Arabia, so a cross sectional approach provided rich information about consumers from a large sample of the population. However, anticipating actual consumer PEBs accurately is difficult, as consumers overestimate their self-reported behaviours (Moser, 2015). It is also difficult to measure differences between initial adoption and continued PEBs. Therefore, it is recommended that future research takes a longitudinal approach, which would enable researchers to test for any changes in PEBs over time.Due to the time and costs involved in longitudinal research, a cross-sectional approach was adopted in this study.
