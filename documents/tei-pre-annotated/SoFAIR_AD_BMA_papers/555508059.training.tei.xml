        <p>Theoretical framework: In The Full Range Leadership Model, Avolio and Bass (1991) offer transformational leadership as one of the most effective leadership styles in mobilizing employees and advancing modern organizations. Transformational leadership encourages employees' self-confidence, optimism and commitment to better continue learning in order to achieve superior performance. However, based on the inconsistent findings, mediator and moderator variables are required to confirm a clearer relationship between transformational leadership and employee performance. Therefore, the novelty of this study is to extend organizational learning culture as a mediating and moderating variable to link these relationships.Theoretical framework: In The Full Range Leadership Model, Avolio and Bass (1991) offer transformational leadership as one of the most effective leadership styles in mobilizing employees and advancing modern organizations.

        <p>J. Avolio and Bass (1991), which presents transformational leadership as one of the most effective leadership styles in modern organizational leadership. Transformational leadership is very popular and has developed into a topic of research interest concerning organizational performance and effectiveness. A number of meta-analytical studies, such as Judge and Piccolo (2004), G. Wang, Oh, Courtright, and Colbert (2011), Crede, Jong, and Harms (2019), addressed a strong relationship among transformational leadership and employee performance.J.

        <p>Although transformational leadership has been studied and researched extensively in relation to and performance of employees across all levels of analysis and organizational types (G. Wang et al., 2011), the results are unclear, and there is no consensus. On the one hand, strong evidence has shown that transformational leaders are able to encourage employees to perform more productively (Amrullah, Haryono, &amp; Wahyuningsih, 2022;Astuty &amp; Udin, 2020;Buil, Martínez, &amp; Matute, 2019;Perdhana, Sawitri, &amp; Chaerunissa, 2022;Yücel, 2021). On the other hand, transformational leadership has no direct effect on employees' adaptive performance (Curado &amp; Santos, 2022). This is also confirmed by the recent findings by Lai, Tang, Lu, Lee, and Lin (2020) that the relationship between transformational leadership and employee performance is insignificant. Eliyana, Ma'arif, and Muzakki (2019), in their research on employees working in the Indonesian harbor, found that transformational leadership had no significant effect on employee performance. Therefore, based on these inconsistent findings, mediator and moderator variables are needed to confirm a clearer relationship between transformational leadership and employee performance. Abbasi and Zamani-Miandashti (2013) found that organizational learning culture mediates the relationship between transformational leadership and employee performance. The culture and learning process applied in the organization not only increases the effectiveness of employee performance but also turns it into a continuous learning organization.

        <p>Employee performance is seen as very useful in encouraging organizational sustainability. Employee performance is the productivity level and work success of an employee related to his/her duty within organization (Babin &amp; Boles, 1998). Giri, Nimran, Hamid, Musadieq, and Al Musadieq (2016) describe employee performance as an employee's work accomplishment as aligned with the normal standards determined by the organization.Employee performance is seen as very useful in encouraging organizational sustainability.

        <p>Employee performance is positively related to organizational effectiveness, which is often measured differently, such as attendance, punctuality, quality of work, and ability to work together (Udin, Dananjoyo, Shaikh, &amp; Vio Linarta, 2022), as well as profitability, productivity, and service satisfaction (N. P.

        <p>Of the various variables that have been examined in the literature, previous studies have found that transformational leadership displays an extensive role in influencing employee performance. Transformational leadership influences, guides, and directs the attitudes, emotions, values, and behavior of employees (Bruce J. Avolio, Gardner, Walumbwa, Luthans, &amp; May, 2004) and motivates them to perform better than expected (Pieterse, van Knippenberg, Schippers, &amp; Stam, 2010). Furthermore, according to Nam and Park (2019), employee performance is also influenced by organizational learning culture. Organizational learning culture is a very meaningful contextual aspect in increasing the positive achievements of employees both at the individual and organizational levels (Egan, Yang, &amp; Bartlett, 2004).Of the various variables that have been examined in the literature, previous studies have found that transformational leadership displays an extensive role in influencing employee performance.

        <p>Organizational learning culture places great emphasis on continuous learning, making it easier for employees to create a comfortable work environment to achieve the desired results. Organizational learning is an activity of processing knowledge and information on an ongoing basis from the internal and external environment carried out by organization members at all levels (Hung, Yang, Lien, McLean, &amp; Kuo, 2010;Tsang, 1997), with the main objective being to store information and knowledge in organizational memory (Huber, 1991).Organizational learning culture places great emphasis on continuous learning, making it easier for employees to create a comfortable work environment to achieve the desired results.

        <p>Organizations that make learning a daily culture are able to achieve business success well because learning becomes an active habit and is always integrated into all organizational functions (Marquardt, 2002).Organizations that make learning a daily culture are able to achieve business success well because learning becomes an active habit and is always integrated into all organizational functions (Marquardt, 2002).</p>
        <p>Organizational learning culture models attitudes, values, and behaviors to support learning (Kandemir &amp; Hult, 2005), at the levels of individual, team, and organizational (Wahda, Mursalim, Fauziah, &amp; Asty, 2020). Organizational learning culture utilizes existing knowledge and information inside and outside the organization to change, develop, and create employee work innovation (A. Usman, Danish, Waheed, &amp; Tayyeb, 2011). Wahda et al. (2020) found that organizational learning culture increases employees' ability to go the extra mile in the organization. Organizational learning culture encourages employees to perform more productively to maintain and improve their higher and overall organizational performance (A. Usman et al., 2011).Organizational learning culture models attitudes, values, and behaviors to support learning (Kandemir &amp; Hult, 2005), at the levels of individual, team, and organizational (Wahda, Mursalim, Fauziah, &amp; Asty, 2020).

        <p>Transformational leadership is defined as a leadership style in which the leader motivates employees to move towards the collective and organizational good regardless of their personal interests (Avolio &amp; Yammarino, 2002). Transformational leaders increase employee trust, confidence, and job value resulting in higher levels of intrinsic motivation to perform at their best (Bernard M Bass, 1985;Seibert, Wang, &amp; Courtright, 2011).Transformational leadership is defined as a leadership style in which the leader motivates employees to move towards the collective and organizational good regardless of their personal interests (Avolio &amp; Yammarino, 2002).

        <p>Transformational leadership always displays four main behaviors: (a) inspirational motivation, i.e., the leader inspires and articulates a clear vision to be achieved, (b) idealized influence, i.e., the leader appears as a role model with a high commitment to a shared vision, (c) intellectual stimulation, i.e., the leader stimulates the minds of their employees to voice creative ideas, (d) individualized consideration, i.e., the leader cares and pays attention to the various needs of employees so that they believe and are satisfied with the leader's treatment (Bernard M Bass, 1985). Furthermore, B. J. Avolio, Bass, Walumbwa, and Zhu (2004) Transformational leadership increases employees' trust, confidence and awareness in the achievement of shared goals and visions so that they strive to be involved in acquiring and developing new knowledge through continuous learning. Transformational leadership also enables employees to be openly committed to learning and makes learning within the organization a key force for superior performance. Furthermore, organizational learning improves the quality and quantity of performance and encourages the achievement of the organization's competitive advantage in the long term (Abbasi &amp; Zamani-Miandashti, 2013).Transformational leadership always displays four main behaviors: (a) inspirational motivation, i.e., the leader inspires and articulates a clear vision to be achieved, (b) idealized influence, i.e., the leader appears as a role model with a high commitment to a shared vision, (c) intellectual stimulation, i.e., the leader stimulates the minds of their employees to voice creative ideas, (d) individualized consideration, i.e., the leader cares and pays attention to the various needs of employees so that they believe and are satisfied with the leader's treatment (Bernard M Bass, 1985).

        <p>The interaction between organizational learning culture and transformational leadership can affect creative performance in organizations (Phipps, Prieto, &amp; Verma, 2012). Thus, Organizational learning culture. Organizational learning culture is measured using 7 question items developed by previous studies (Lin &amp; Huang, 2021;Naqshbandi &amp; Tabche, 2018;Yang, Watkins, &amp; Marsick, 2004), such as "when employees learn, they are highly appreciated in the organization".The interaction between organizational learning culture and transformational leadership can affect creative performance in organizations (Phipps, Prieto, &amp; Verma, 2012).

        <p>Employee performance. Employee performance is measured using 6 question items developed by previous studies (Astuty &amp; Udin, 2020;Buil et al., 2019;Udin et al., 2022), such as "employees exhibit the adequate quality of work on target".Employee performance.

        <p>All respondents' responses in this research were assessed using a five-point Likert scale with answers ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. Table 1 summarizes the convergent validity test results that each item's factor loading value ranges from 0.531 to 0.823, which exceeds the threshold value of 0.50 (J. F. Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, &amp; Tatham, 2009). This exhibits and demonstrates that all items are significant, provoking the measurement model's convergent validity. All variables' Cronbach's α values ranged from 0.575 to 0.851, above the acceptable level of 0.60 (J. F.

        <p>The values of CR (composite reliability) (for transformational leadership, organizational learning culture, and employee performance) were 0.888, 0.825 and 0.853, respectively, which were higher than 0.70 as recommended by Sarstedt, Hair, and Ringle (2022). Moreover, all AVE (average variance extracted) values (for transformational leadership, organizational learning culture, and employee performance) values were 0.534, 0.406, and 0.495, respectively, which outstripped the acceptable level of 0.40 (J. F. Hair et al., 2009;Lam, 2012). Fornell-Larcker is used in this study to determine the discriminant validity of the measurement model. Table 2 shows that the diagonals are greater than the correlations between constructs, implying good discriminant validity (Chin, 1998). The results in Table 3 and Figure 1 revealed that transformational leadership is significantly related to employee performance (β = 0.468, t-value = 3.950, p = 0.003) and organizational learning culture (β = 0.809, t-value = 38.104, p = 0.000). Thus, H1 and H2 are supported. In addition, H3 is also supported since organizational learning culture significantly affects employee performance (β = 0.257, t-value = 2.309, p = 0.044). Further, the statistical result shows the significant mediating effect of organizational learning culture between transformational leadership and employee performance (β = 0.208, t-value = 2.236, p = 0.049), supporting H4. Consistently, the statistical finding reveals that the moderation effect of organizational learning culture on the relationship between transformation leadership and employee performance is significant (β = 0.169, t-value = 2.470, p = 0.033). Thus, H5 is also supported.The values of CR (composite reliability) (for transformational leadership, organizational learning culture, and employee performance) were 0.888, 0.825 and 0.853, respectively, which were higher than 0.70 as recommended by Sarstedt, Hair, and Ringle (2022).

        <p>This study found that transformational leadership is significantly related to employee performance and organizational learning culture. Transformational leadership encourages employees' self-confidence, optimism and commitment to continue learning well in order to achieve superior performance. Transformational leadership inspires employees to develop their knowledge and engage in totality in continuous learning to sow the common good and the organization as a whole, which in turn, encourages creativity and innovation of employees to produce the best performance. By using inspirational motivation and intellectual stimulation, transformational leaders inspire employees to complete challenging tasks and solve problems well to realize the collective vision of the organization (Bernard M Bass &amp; Riggio, 2006;Nuel, Ifechi, &amp; Emmanuella, 2021). Transformational leaders pay attention to and facilitate the needs of employees to develop themselves so that they actualize themselves well to achieve work goals (Atiyeh, 2022;Tongkachok, Garg, Balakrishnan, &amp; Vijayalakshmi, 2022).This study found that transformational leadership is significantly related to employee performance and organizational learning culture.

        <p>This study also found that organizational learning culture not only directly affects employee performance but is able to mediate and moderate the relationship among transformational leadership and employee performance. Organizational learning culture influences the way employees carry out daily learning and acquire knowledge, which in turn, increases their high motivation to pursue performance goals. Organizational learning culture is very important, which acknowledges employees to discover innovative ways of solving problems, and updating new skills and knowledge in the workplace (Choi, 2020) to achieve outstanding performance. The articulation of a clear long-term vision and goals of a transformational leader is able to transform the work and learning environment within the organization, which in turn, influences successful performance. Transformational leadership has long been believed to be one of the main determining factors in enhancing organizational learning, which can change employees' attitudes and behavior in their workplaces to achieve and maintain a competitive organizational advantage (Park &amp; Kim, 2018).This study also found that organizational learning culture not only directly affects employee performance but is able to mediate and moderate the relationship among transformational leadership and employee performance.

        <p>The findings of this study conclude that transformational leadership is significantly associated with employee performance and organizational learning culture. Furthermore, organizational learning culture is significantly associated with employee performance. In addition, organizational learning culture exhibits a mediating and moderating role between transformational leadership and employee performance. The results of this study have implications for the practice of developing human resources to improve employee performance in organizations, both public and private organizations. Leaders and HR managers can facilitate and cultivate continuous learning at all levels of the organization, namely at the level of employees, teams and the organization as a whole, to generate new and useful ideas for successful employee performance. They should also move further, namely by maintaining and implementing a transformational leadership style, where the leader describes an attractive future vision and builds good communication with employees regularly, which is believed to be able to influence the employee's desire to learn and develop themselves in order to achieve the expected goals collectively.The findings of this study conclude that transformational leadership is significantly associated with employee performance and organizational learning culture.

        <p>Therefore, the generalizability of the findings of this study is very limited to the number of samples. In addition, data collection using questionnaires only came from one source, namely employee responses to the variables in this study, which indicated a single source bias (P. M. Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, &amp; Podsakoff, 2003). Thus, future research is recommended to further expand the research sample, even if adopting the model in this study, it is necessary to pay attention to two-way responses, namely from leaders and employees, to obtain more valid and convincing data.Therefore, the generalizability of the findings of this study is very limited to the number of samples.
