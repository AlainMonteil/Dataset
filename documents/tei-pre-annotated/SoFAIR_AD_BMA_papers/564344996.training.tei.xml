        <p>Although digital technologies grant documented operational and economic benefits, they can activate unwanted consequences for the environment and society. This research investigates these issues by exploring how firms can create a portfolio of technologies to perform corporate social responsibility (CSR) goals and then achieving responsible digitalization. The latter is defined as the firms' capacity of adopting digital technologies without underperforming in terms of CSR. Accordingly, we investigate the relationships between digital technologies and CSR to discover the firms' capacity to achieve responsible digitalization targets. Furthermore, we explore how the use of some green practices allows firms to increase the chances of achieving responsible digitalization goals.Although digital technologies grant documented operational and economic benefits, they can activate unwanted consequences for the environment and society.

        <p>The adoption of digital technologies has been both fashionable and attractive in recent years due to the potential benefits of their use and the role they play in the digital world (Frank et al., 2019;Ivanov et al., 2016). All transformations and technological revolutions, especially those occurring after the 1950s, have brought great prosperity, progress, and value. However, firms require further analysis to better understand such rapid and increasing trends, specifically whether the transformation occurring through digital technologies provides real advantages and concrete market opportunities along with social and environmental benefits. In any case, firms must perform a comprehensive analysis of the strategic behavioral changes required to properly select and use digital technologies, an accurate estimation of their economic outcomes, and a careful assessment of the implications for the entire eco-system (Ivanov et al., 2016;Saberi et al., 2019). In the past, several unintended consequences have followed the industrial transformation and revolutions, including climate change and global warming, pollution, and the increasing presence of plastic in oceans, to mention a few. Therefore, the current digital transformation could have similar effects if left unchecked.The adoption of digital technologies has been both fashionable and attractive in recent years due to the potential benefits of their use and the role they play in the digital world (Frank et al., 2019;Ivanov et al., 2016).

        <p>The implementation of digital technologies requires a comprehensive analysis of their adoption, including the complex regulatory, tax, auditability, risk, and compliance implications linked to global business (Cole et al., 2020) and extended to the environmental and social spheres (Liu &amp; De Giovanni, 2019). Restrictive legislation, reputational pressure, corruption, misleading information and products, human rights and gender violations, unknown working conditions, and security are only some of the factors firms should consider when selecting their portfolio of digital technologies. In this sense, De Giovanni (2021) coined the concept of responsible digitalization, which is exemplified by the firms' capability to achieve their Corporate Social Responsible (CSR) goals by adopting digital technologies. Accordingly, firms should not restrict their focus on digital technologies as merely boosters of enhancing economic performance, but they should carefully evaluate the digital technologies' implications in terms of environmental effects and social targets.The implementation of digital technologies requires a comprehensive analysis of their adoption, including the complex regulatory, tax, auditability, risk, and compliance implications linked to global business (Cole et al., 2020) and extended to the environmental and social spheres (Liu &amp; De Giovanni, 2019).

        <p>As empirically shown in De Giovanni (2021), digital technologies can harm both the social and the environmental spheres. For example, a farmer who invests in robotics can achieve positive benefits for the environment by reducing production waste and the energy used.As empirically shown in De Giovanni (2021), digital technologies can harm both the social and the environmental spheres. For example, a farmer who invests in robotics can achieve positive benefits for the environment by reducing production waste and the energy used.</p>
        <p>However, recent estimates show that a crop-harvesting robot can replace up to 30 human workers. Therefore, robotics can generate important social "rebound effects" that any digital transformation process cannot disregard. Similarly, Industry 4.0 technologies can ensure a lower scrap rate, high saturation of manufacturing equipment, low waste, and superior energy efficiency (Müller et al., 2018). However, production systems using robotics and big data can become highly capital-intensive, which can result in overall higher energy consumption (Indri et al., 2018). In fact, the use of big data requires data centers to consume around 200 terawatt hours annually, which is greater than the total energy consumption of some countries (e.g., Argentina, Ukraine, Thailand), half of the electricity used for transport worldwide, and around 1% of the global electricity demand (Lovell, 2018).However, recent estimates show that a crop-harvesting robot can replace up to 30 human workers.

        <p>According to the described frameworks, digital technologies can have an uncertain and questionable effect on CSR, which requires an accurate and rigorous analysis of both benefits and drawbacks. The adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems allows firms to proactively mitigate global supply chains risks and disruptions. For example, AI systems extrapolate information from the eco-system, identify possible sources of delay, and proposes alternative solutions to nullify such inconveniences (De Giovanni, 2021). For example, the identification of a potential strike of a port labor force induces the AI system to suggest moving goods by plane rather than by boat. Although this option ensures on-time deliveries and consumer satisfaction, it also induces important environmental damages, since transportation by plane implies higher emissions than transportation by boat. Therefore, firms achieve responsible digitalization when the adoption of digital technologies guarantees the Triple Bottom Line (i.e., economic, social, and environmental outcomes) and consequently CSR goals.According to the described frameworks, digital technologies can have an uncertain and questionable effect on CSR, which requires an accurate and rigorous analysis of both benefits and drawbacks.

        <p>We insert our contribution within this framework and investigate whether the adoption of a portfolio of digital technologies allows firms to pursue CSR targets. Therefore, we contribute to the recent debate of how firms can effectively reach CSR goals (Ben-Amar et al., 2021). With our design, the portfolio of digital technologies is composed of AI systems, Internet of Things (IoT), Intelligent Transport Systems, and Big Data. Furthermore, we consider CSR as a secondorder factor measured by economic performance, environmental initiatives, and social effects. By investigating the relationship between digital technologies and CSR, we contribute to the literature by investigating whether firms can achieve responsible digitalization. Furthermore, we explore the benefits that firms can obtain when implementing environment-based strategies exemplified by green process innovation, energy-efficient solutions, green packaging and recycling materials, circular economy, and safety risk practices. We thus investigate whether these practices can enhance responsible digitalization. In this sense, our findings not only contribute to the academic literature by creating additional knowledge regarding the concept of responsible digitalization, but they also offer new insights for managers and practitioners.We insert our contribution within this framework and investigate whether the adoption of a portfolio of digital technologies allows firms to pursue CSR targets.

        <p>To pursue the objective of our study, we used a sample of 157 firms and carry out an empirical analysis composed of four steps: 1. Identification of the CSR pillars, 2. Definition of CSR and digital technologies, 3. Responsible digitalization by exploring the nature of digital technologies' impact on CSR, and 4. Adoption of environment-based practices to enhance responsible digitalization. We develop an exploratory factor analysis to carry out the first two points. In step 3, we then run a set of linear and non-linear regression analyses to establish the best relationship between digital technologies and CSR. Finally, in step 4, we use the model outcomes obtained in step 3 and run some moderation analyses to investigate the responsible digitalization improvements resulting from the adoption of environmental-based practices.To pursue the objective of our study, we used a sample of 157 firms and carry out an empirical analysis composed of four steps: 1.

        <p>There exists a linear relationship between digital technologies and CSR in which economic performance has greater importance than environmental attitudes and social interactions. While the non-linear models show an insignificant relationship, the linear relationships between digital technologies and CSR can be improved when firms implement green process innovations, adopt energy-efficient solutions, and use both green packaging and recycling materials. These practices allow firms to boost the responsible digitalization levels.There exists a linear relationship between digital technologies and CSR in which economic performance has greater importance than environmental attitudes and social interactions.

        <p>Finally, neither circular economy nor safety risk procedures induce higher responsible digitalization, resulting in effective practices to achieve other targets.

        <p>Considering the numerous theories developed to explain the concept of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) (Garriga &amp; Melé, 2004), it is not easy to find a unique definition. However, all definitions converge on five fundamental dimensions: the stakeholder, social, economic, voluntariness, and environmental dimensions (Dahlsrud, 2008).Considering the numerous theories developed to explain the concept of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) (Garriga &amp; Melé, 2004), it is not easy to find a unique definition.

        <p>Among firms and organizations, the CSR concept has been internalized according to three of those five dimensions, the economic, environmental, and social dimensions (Epstein, 2017). These three pillars become the key ingredients of the Triple Bottom Line (TBL), which is a term coined by John Elkington in the early 1980s and referred to the firms' capacity to achieve successful economic, environmental, and social performance, and represents a proxy to measure CSR. Therefore, the TBL is an antecedence of CSR; the latter has broader targets that also include legal, ethical, and philanthropic responsibility (De Giovanni &amp; Vinzi, 2014). According to Norman and MacDonal (2004), firms committing themselves to the TBL principles make a real, verifiable, and trustable commitment toward CSR.Among firms and organizations, the CSR concept has been internalized according to three of those five dimensions, the economic, environmental, and social dimensions (Epstein, 2017).

        <p>The implementation of digital technologies can represent the potential to take a further step toward CSR. To explain the links between CSR and digital transformation, De Giovanni (2021) coined the concept of responsible digitalization to describe firms' capacity to identify and implement the digital technologies to perform the TBL and achieve CSR goals. By developing a simulated SC framework, he evaluates the benefits that an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system provides in terms of improving profits (economic dimension), emissions (environmental dimension), and consumers' access to goods (social dimension). Interestingly, De Giovanni (2021) finds that AI seldom leads to responsible digitalization, since the environmental and the social pillars are challenging targets that digital technologies do not necessarily contemplate.The implementation of digital technologies can represent the potential to take a further step toward CSR.

        <p>To our knowledge, De Giovanni (2021) is the only research inspired by the concept of responsible digitalization. Rather, the literature has sponsored the adoption of digital technologies to promote a limited batch of performance dimensions, showing the existence of certain trade-offs and requiring the creation of new digital capabilities.To our knowledge, De Giovanni (2021) is the only research inspired by the concept of responsible digitalization.

        <p>To demonstrate this issue, Dalenogare et al. (2018) investigate the relationships between digital technologies and performance, discovering that none of the digital technologies can improve all performance dimensions simultaneously; hence, firms should first select their targets and then decide on the digital technologies to implement. For example, Big Data can have contrasting effects on performance: operational performance can be considerably improved, while social performance exemplified by product customization, quality, and time-to-market can deteriorate (De Giovanni, 2021). The responsible digitalization helps firms in driving the corporate digital responsibility process, which is defined by Lobschat et al. (2021) as the acquisition of a set of norms and values that guides the firms' decisions and behaviors and contributes to new managerial styles and culture.To demonstrate this issue, Dalenogare et al.

        <p>Responsible digitalization is then an antecedent of corporate digital responsibility since a digital technology that is not in line with CSR goals cannot become a set of norms and values constituting the corporate digital responsibility. Liu and De Giovanni (2019) study the economic, environmental, and social benefits linked to investments in I4.0 technologies, focusing on Robotics and IoT. They discover an eco-innovation paradox that arises when investing in digitalization. Digital technologies, in fact, increase firms' capacity to abate the emissions linked to the production process. At the same time, a high number of consumers can access the product, thereby requiring additional production cycles. This access leads to an increase in total emissions, thus generating a stagnation of the environmental performance. This result is in line with the debate in the SC literature over I4.0 and environmental performance. For example, digital technologies can ensure a lower scrap rate, high saturation of manufacturing equipment, low waste, and superior energy efficiency (Müller et al., 2018;Stock &amp; Seliger, 2016). However, production systems using robotics and Big Data can become highly capital-intensive, which could result in overall higher energy consumption (Grau et al., 2017;Indri et al., 2018). Furthermore, the use of Big Data requires data centers to consume around 200 terawatt-hours annually, which is more than the energy consumption of some countries (e.g., Argentina, Ukraine, Thailand), half of the electricity used for transport worldwide, and around 1% of the global electricity demand (Lovell, 2018). Currently, data centers contribute approximately 0.3% to the overall carbon emissions, while the ICT sector accounts for more than 2% of global emissions (Jones, 2018). Finally, the adoption of I4.0 technologies aims to increase productivity over the SC (Saucedo-Martínez et al., 2018;Zhong et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the presence of outdated production and logistics systems can result in increasing emissions and pollution, with a strong detrimental effect on the environment (Nagy, 2019). Accordingly, digital transformation through I4.0 technologies can require a systematic change in SCs, including green investments in terms of products, processes, and SC networks (de Sousa Jabbour et al., 2018a, 2018b).Responsible digitalization is then an antecedent of corporate digital responsibility since a digital technology that is not in line with CSR goals cannot become a set of norms and values constituting the corporate digital responsibility.

        <p>The debate regarding the impact of I4.0 technologies is much stronger and more groundbreaking when considering the social sphere in which it takes place. The current implementation of I4.0 is most likely seen as a threat (Horváth &amp; Szab o, 2019), leading to changes in working conditions and wages, a lack of skilled workforces, the risk of losing jobs, workforce mobility, and the need for training programs (Basl, 2017;Bauer et al., 2015;Müller &amp; Voigt, 2018). Therefore, it is necessary to reshape the current organizational strategies and paths for implementing digitalization projects aimed at CSR. According to the described framework, I4.0 technologies can have an uncertain and questionable effect on CSR, which requires an accurate and rigorous analysis of both the benefits and the drawbacks of such a system. In fact, the current state-of-the-art suggests that firms and SCs invest in According to the Norman and MacDonal (2004), sustainability plays a key role in achieving CSR. While digitalization is the latest revolutionary trend, sustainable practices have served as the drivers to reach CSR for many decades along with traditional drivers like stakeholder orientation, governance, and CSR incentives (Ben-Amar et al., 2021). Therefore, firms undergoing digital transformation must integrate the related technologies within green strategies and environmental practices. Surely, firms seeking to achieve CSR goals must undertake a set of green practices, which are then a definitive prerequisite (Babiak &amp; Trendafilova, 2011). In fact, digitalization can be responsible when digital platforms, systems, and technologies are used to pursue CSR targets, which are induced by low energy consumption through digital applications for proactive maintenance and production planning, low emissions through an efficient impact of processes, suppliers, and operations, high societal objectives through security, privacy, and identity protection, and appealing economic yields achieved by using secure systems, transactions, and platforms.The debate regarding the impact of I4.0 technologies is much stronger and more groundbreaking when considering the social sphere in which it takes place.

        <p>All of these goals are potentially feasible when adopting effective green practices (De Giovanni &amp; Cariola, 2020).All of these goals are potentially feasible when adopting effective green practices (De Giovanni &amp; Cariola, 2020).</p>
        <p>The literature has provided a warning regarding the impact of green practices to achieve CSR goals through digitalization. However, research in this field is still rare. For example, robotics application technologies help manufacturing systems handle repetitive jobs and enables continuous systems to achieve economies of scale and efficiency (Bochmann et al., 2017). All robotics equipment includes sensors, intelligence to make autonomous decisions, and collaborative operations with humans (cobots) for improved productivity, quality, and lead times (Pfeiffer, 2016). However, robotics needs investment in process innovation and adjustments of production processes, which should be inspired by green principles and targets; furthermore, robotics can create social issues, leading to a non-responsible situation.The literature has provided a warning regarding the impact of green practices to achieve CSR goals through digitalization.

        <p>Similarly, Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) and Intelligent Transport Systems accomplish efficiency and effective transportation tasks through their versatility (Lu et al., 2017). By integrating AGV with (RFID) applications, firms benefit from smart AGV systems that autonomously optimize the decision-making process (e.g., the material routes), improve the traditional guidance methods (e.g., optical line), communicate with other parties in real time, determine performance, interact easily with users, and enable reconfigurable manufacturing systems (Mehami et al., 2018). However, AGV increases several operational risks linked to physical constraints: perfectly even floors to remove all possible vibrations harming the connections, electrical conductivity systems to ensure proper charges, and clean spaces to avoid light and dust that obscure the AGV's sensors. Accordingly, firms might require ad hoc investments in safety systems to avoid these risks.Similarly, Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) and Intelligent Transport Systems accomplish efficiency and effective transportation tasks through their versatility (Lu et al., 2017).

        <p>To test our research hypotheses, we designed a survey to collect information about the respondents (e.g., industry and company type), the investments in Industry 4.0 technology, the implemented green practices, and the CSR goals. The questionnaire has been pre-tested through a pool of experts (professors, Ph.D. students, professionals, managers) from whom we asked for feedback about wording, readability, and completeness. Consequently, the survey was modified and improved accordingly.To test our research hypotheses, we designed a survey to collect information about the respondents (e.g., industry and company type), the investments in Industry 4.0 technology, the implemented green practices, and the CSR goals.

        <p>The data collection process began by subjecting the survey to an initial sample of 1200 firms' managers. We chose to interview professionals who are active in this domain. They were contacted via email. Within 2 weeks, we received the majority of the responses. In the meantime, we extended our investigation by contacting them by phone. Overall, we obtained a total of 157 usable observations, excluding those removed as invalid. This represents about 12% of the entire population of companies that we targeted (1200). More than half of the organizations had an average sale turnover of more than 100 million (52%) and a workforce of more than 200 employees (53%).The data collection process began by subjecting the survey to an initial sample of 1200 firms' managers.

        <p>The first approach consisted of comparing early and late respondents (i.e., first and second to third surveys).

        <p>CSR is measured as a second-order factor. As mentioned earlier, the CSR construct is composed of different ingredients and several dimensions. Therefore, we cannot identify a bath of indicators that measures CSR. Rather, one needs to first measure the various components of CSR, which are represented by the TBL. Specifically, we measure the components economic performance, environmental attitudes, and social interactions as isolated phenomenon and then check their joint contribution in measuring CSR. We have displayed our research framework graphically in Figure 1. To pursue our research targets, we have used a Principal Component Analysis, which aims at summarizing various measures into single components. Hence, we used it for the TBL measures and then also for the CSR and the digital technologies.

        <p>The first objective of this procedure is to define the single constructs linked to the TBL. Therefore, we seek to identify the components linked to economic performance, environmental attitudes, and social interactions. To accomplish our target, we run an Exploratory Factor Analysis using a Principle Component Analysis. In our specific case, we run a Block Exploratory Factor Analysis to measure the TBL pillars as isolated phenomenon and independent of all the rest. Note that this is done because we seek to measure CSR as a second order factor; hence, each TBL component will be first studied through a single Block Exploratory Factor Analysis.The first objective of this procedure is to define the single constructs linked to the TBL.

        <p>We start the search for the first block by developing the component Economic Performance (EcP), which is defined as the firm's ability to generate economic value. Each of the items included in the constructs have been measured by asking the question: "In the last two years, our company has performed in terms of…". Then, we have used the following items: ROI (EcP1), which indicates the firm's ability to profitably allocate its investments; profits (EcP2), which is the ability to create profits; market share (EcP3), which indicates how the firm performs with respect to its competitors; and cost savings (EcP4) as an indicator of the firm's capability to enable efficient practices. Our statistical results indicate that Economic Performance has one dimension only, with an associated eigenvalue of 2.454 and explaining 61.339% of the variance. The second eigenvalue scores 0.9, highlighting the existence of a unique dimension. Therefore, these four measures will form the first block of our research. We exclude the item "Cost of Energy" from the construct, since it has a low loading. This is probably linked to the fact that firms do not have control over the energy cost, which is decided by regulators. Rather, they control the energy consumption.We start the search for the first block by developing the component Economic Performance (EcP), which is defined as the firm's ability to generate economic value.

        <p>The second block that we explore links to the construct Environmental Attitudes (EA), which summarizes the firm's ability to pursue environmental outcomes.

Third, environmental impact (EA3) indicates, in general terms, the impact of the firms' business activities on the environment. The results of the block analysis show the existence of one factor, whose associated eigenvalue is equal to 1.938 and explains 64.604% of the variance. The second eigenvalue scores 0.9; therefore, uniqueness is ensured for environmental attitudes, which represents the second block for our analysis.

        <p>Finally, we investigate the concept Social Interactions (SI), which considers firms' capacity to perform the social-oriented policies implemented by the firm. To properly measure this construct we used the question "In the last two years, our company has targeted to improve the following consumer-based dimensions…" and obtained data on the following items: (1) Loyalty (SI1), which indicates the company's ability to retain its customer base and highlights the increasing consumers' attention on social and ethical policies; (2) Brand interaction (SI2), which measures the company's ability to be close to its consumer and develop interactions during all life-cycle stages; andFinally, we investigate the concept Social Interactions (SI), which considers firms' capacity to perform the social-oriented policies implemented by the firm.

        <p>Upon obtaining the three factors of economic performance, environmental attitudes, and social interactions, we run a second-order factor analysis to identify the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) component. We compute the scores associated with each of the three performance-related constructs and run an Explorative Factor Analysis. The latter includes both the CSR and digital technologies. For these two constructs, there is no further second order factor to be analyzed; therefore, we proceed by a traditional Explorative Factor Analysis through a Principal Component Analysis to check for unidimensionality, as displayed in Table 3.Upon obtaining the three factors of economic performance, environmental attitudes, and social interactions, we run a second-order factor analysis to identify the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) component.

        <p>Instead, the second eigenvalue scores 0.4, highlighting the existence of unidimensionality. Accordingly, our results show that the CSR is mainly driven by economic outcomes, since economic performance has a loading of 0.812. In contrast, environmental attitudes (EP) and social interactions (SP) have 0.810 and 0.696 values, respectively, meaning that firms put on the top of their targets economic performance, then environmental sphere, and lastly social pillars. Clearly, great economic outcomes serve as a driver to achieve other targets in a sustainable way, as being green and socially responsible is costly.Instead, the second eigenvalue scores 0.4, highlighting the existence of unidimensionality.

        <p>Regarding the construct Digital Technologies, the Factor Analysis suggests removing 3D printing and Robotics from the component. This is probably linked to the use of these digital technologies in manufacturing activities, while the sample includes firms belonging to other types of activities as well. Hence, our analysis gives one factor, with an Eigenvalue of 2.485 which explains 49.498% of the variance.Regarding the construct Digital Technologies, the Factor Analysis suggests removing 3D printing and Robotics from the component.

        <p>Step 2, we use the related scores obtained by 
            <rs type="software">XL-Stat</rs>
            <rs type="version">2021.2.1</rs> to investigate their relationships. Therefore, we run a set of regression analyses to investigate H 1 , that is, the impact of digital technology adoption on CSR, where CSR is the dependent variable and digital technologies is the independent variables. In this phase, we cannot really assume any specific type of relationship between digital technologies and CSR, since it can be either linear or non-linear. Hence, instead of assuming a certain relationship, we run a batch of regression analyses composed of a linear regression analysis as well as a set of non-linear regression analysis to search for the best model to explain CSR through digital technologies. All results that we obtain are displayed in Table 4.

        <p>After identifying the best fit between digital technologies and CSR, we run some further regression analyses using the six moderating variables representing the adoption of specific green practices: investment in green process innovation, use of green packaging, use of recycled materials, adoption of safety risk procedures, implementation of circular economy systems, and adoption of energy efficient solutions. For these items, we asked to the interviewees the following question: "In the last two years, our company has adopted the following green practices:", and the items were measured through a "Yes" or "No" answer.After identifying the best fit between digital technologies and CSR, we run some further regression analyses using the six moderating variables representing the adoption of specific green practices: investment in green process innovation, use of green packaging, use of recycled materials, adoption of safety risk procedures, implementation of circular economy systems, and adoption of energy efficient solutions.

Accordingly, firms can exploit the synergies existing between digital technologies and green process innovation to achieve higher levels of CSR. Investing in digital technologies can supply key driving information to pursue CSR. For example, an AI system can identify the source of pollution within a production process and suggest the actions to undertake. Furthermore, IoT sensors can detect increasing temperature levels requiring increasing energy consumption. These cases call for investment in process innovations to mitigate the environmental inefficiency, thus enabling firms to achieve responsible digitalization by corroborating the strengths of digital technologies with green process innovation to leverage their CSR levels.Hypothesis H 2a , whose moderating variable is the presence of green process innovations, is supported, since the regression coefficient β = 0.575 (p-value &lt; 0.01) turns out to be higher than the original proposed model with z-value = 3.994.

        <p>Along with green process innovation, firms can rely on the adoption of energy-efficient solutions to improve the impact of digital hours annually, which represents more than the energy consumption of some countries (e.g., Argentina, Ukraine, Thailand), half of the electricity used for transport worldwide, and around 1% of the global electricity demand (Lovell, 2018). The adoption of energy-efficient solutions from this perspective thus illustrates an urgent need.

        <p>The first hypothesis, H 2e , refers to the return management procedures that shows a coefficient of β = 0.468 (p-value &lt; 0.01) that, although significant, shows an insignificant improvement with respect to the original coefficient (the z-test gives a z-value = 0.126). Consequently, the effects of AI systems, Intelligent Transportation, IoT, and Big Data on CSR cannot be powered by a circular economy system. This is probably due to the definition of CSR that we have given in this research, which lacks a direct link to circular economy features like recycling, reverse logistics, collectors' incentives, and return rates.The first hypothesis, H 2e , refers to the return management procedures that shows a coefficient of β = 0.468 (p-value &lt; 0.01) that, although significant, shows an insignificant improvement with respect to the original coefficient (the z-test gives a z-value = 0.126).

        <p>In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework to enrich the literature of a new concept, namely, responsible digitalization. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that deals with this concept from both a theoretical point of view and an empirical point of view. In fact, responsible digitalization has been coined by De Giovanni (2021) and analyzed using a game theory approach; here, the concept finds application in a specific research setting linked to the game structure using Artificial Intelligence, emissions, and profits as main ingredients.In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework to enrich the literature of a new concept, namely, responsible digitalization.

        <p>Instead, this paper brings the concept of responsible digitalization to another level, in which the batch of digital technologies investigated is much wider, the set environmental practices is very broad, and the focus is on CSR. Therefore, this research aims at creating knowledge around the concept of responsible digitalization by taking both a theoretical approach and an empirical approach.Instead, this paper brings the concept of responsible digitalization to another level, in which the batch of digital technologies investigated is much wider, the set environmental practices is very broad, and the focus is on CSR.

        <p>From a theoretical approach point of view, the study contributes to the analysis of CSR as a second-order factor in which the TBL pillars given by economic, environmental, and social components are first studied separately and independently and then put all together to investigate the CSR. The development of a second-order factor is necessary in the domain of CSR since it is well documented that the TBL can often be in a trade-off. For example, the development of green chemicals to get rid of industrial waste turns out to be considerably effective from an environmental perspective while bringing important challenges from an economic point of view due to the technology immaturity and its expensive implementation. Hence, rather than struggling to find (ineffective or partial) measures to directly observe CSR, we develop a theoretical framework to study CSR as a secondorder factor that carries out a comprehensive meaning as being composed of the TBL. Hence, firms, supply chains, governments, and policy makers can use the approach suggested in this research to comprehensively study CSR.From a theoretical approach point of view, the study contributes to the analysis of CSR as a second-order factor in which the TBL pillars given by economic, environmental, and social components are first studied separately and independently and then put all together to investigate the CSR.

        <p>Afterwards, we enrich the theoretical framework by searching for digital technologies aiming at the CSR and leading to responsible digitalization. This search is justified by the challenging trade-offs emerging from the digital transformation. For example, the use of Big Data requires a heavy consumption of energy; therefore, along with the well-document benefits, there are unwanted consequences leading to worse environmental performance. Similarly, the adoption of Intelligent Transportation Systems induces several opportunities in terms of risk reduction, efficiency, and effectiveness; however, it decreases the job opportunities for logistics operators, consequently harming the social sphere. Therefore, firms, supply chains, governments, and policy makers should take into consideration the possible impacts that digital technologies can have on CSR before diving into their implementation. This would lead them to target responsible digitalization.Afterwards, we enrich the theoretical framework by searching for digital technologies aiming at the CSR and leading to responsible digitalization.

        <p>Finally, we suggest a theoretical framework that considers, along with investments in digitalization, also investments in green practices. If, as earlier mentioned, the digital technologies can have some side effects on CSR, the adoption of green practices can mitigate such effect and lead to responsible digitalization. In such a case, being conscious of the implications of digital technologies, the adoption of green practices can support the transition to a more responsible digitalization process.Finally, we suggest a theoretical framework that considers, along with investments in digitalization, also investments in green practices.

        <p>Therefore, firms, supply chains, governments, and policy makers should be aware of the challenges that digital transformation can entail and make use of green practices to mitigate possible unwanted effects.Therefore, firms, supply chains, governments, and policy makers should be aware of the challenges that digital transformation can entail and make use of green practices to mitigate possible unwanted effects.</p>
        <p>In addition to providing a theoretical framework, we also seek to test it using an empirical approach. Therefore, we pursue an empirical analysis composed of four steps: First, we measure the TBL pillars to search for their isolated effects; second, we use the TBL to measure the CSR, which becomes a second-order factor; third, we explore the link between digital technologies and CSR to identify the type of existing relationships leading to responsible digitalization; finally, we check whether the adoption of some green practices can boost the opportunities for firms to set responsible digitalization goals.In addition to providing a theoretical framework, we also seek to test it using an empirical approach.

        <p>Our findings suggest that CSR is a multidimensional component made of economic performance, environmental attitudes, and social intentions. Then, a portfolio of digital technologies composed of Artificial Intelligence, Big Data Analytics, Intelligent Transport Systems, and IoT allows firms to achieve responsible digitalization. Among the constellation of models we have investigated, we identify a linear relationship existing among the digital technologies and CSR, which leads to responsible digitalization. Finally, we observe that green packaging, recycling material, energy efficient solutions, and green process innovation are effective green practices to improve the transition toward responsible digitalization.Our findings suggest that CSR is a multidimensional component made of economic performance, environmental attitudes, and social intentions.

        <p>Our work has several limitations that can be seen as opportunities to explore future research in the same domain. First of all, we developed a theoretical framework and then we tested it using a sample composed of 157 firms. Indeed, other samples can be used in the future to check the validity of these findings, which can be either based on a single sector or on a single country. Furthermore, we have focused our interests on a few digital technologies, while the panorama of technologies available is rich with opportunity.Our work has several limitations that can be seen as opportunities to explore future research in the same domain.

        <p>Hence, future research can develop alternative portfolios of digital technologies and check the attitude toward performing responsible digitalization. Similarly, we have taken a certain number of items to measure CSR, reaching 60% of the explained variance. This implies that other items should be considered to explain higher variance.Hence, future research can develop alternative portfolios of digital technologies and check the attitude toward performing responsible digitalization.

        <p>Future research can investigate these directions to improve the body of knowledge in this domain. We focused on environmentalbased moderators. However, other types of moderators can be used in the future, like coordination, innovation, supply chain collaboration, quality management, and incentives for sustainable initiatives.Future research can investigate these directions to improve the body of knowledge in this domain.

        <p>It would be interesting to analyze the concept of responsible digitalization in a dynamic manner; the application of dynamic models and approaches will determine how responsible digitalization evolves over time and how one can improve its path. This is a current investigation that the authors are pursuing.It would be interesting to analyze the concept of responsible digitalization in a dynamic manner; the application of dynamic models and approaches will determine how responsible digitalization evolves over time and how one can improve its path.
