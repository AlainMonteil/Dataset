        <p>Although critical questions have been posed regarding the concept of green marketing, and the lack of genuine contribution of this field to sustainability transitions (cf. Peattie &amp; Crane, 2005), many recent studies have reported empirical evidence for the positive impact of environmental practices on business performance and corporate image (e.g. Hang, Geyer-Klingeberg, &amp; Rathgeber, 2019;Mukonza &amp; Swarts, 2020; Zubeltzu-Jaka, Erauskin-Tolosa, &amp; Heras-Saizarbitoria, 2018). A meta-analysis of Tsai, Huang and Chen (2020) revealed that environmental practices are positively associated with firm performance, whereas the degree of association depends on contextual factors. In a related study, Hartmann and Vachon (2018) investigated the role of the industry context on the relationship between environmental management and performance. However, differences between consumer and business markets remain underexplored.Although critical questions have been posed regarding the concept of green marketing, and the lack of genuine contribution of this field to sustainability transitions (cf.

        <p>Suki (2016) investigated the influence of green brand knowledge, attitude towards green brand and green brand positioning on green product purchase intentions, in a B2C context. Also within a B2C setting, Suki (2017) investigated product quality, corporate image, store image and price as antecedents for customer satisfaction and loyalty. More in general, studies tend to focus on green buying behaviour in B2C markets, especially fast moving consumer goods (Konuk, Rahman, &amp; Salo, 2015;Suki, 2017) and green services (Martinez, 2015). There seems to be a lack of focus on research investigating whether B2C findings also apply to the B2B context (Lim, 2016). One of the notable exceptions of green marketing studies in B2B context appears to be the study of Fraj, Martínez and Matute (2013), reporting on the role of environmental values and organizational culture in developing green marketing strategies.Suki (2016) investigated the influence of green brand knowledge, attitude towards green brand and green brand positioning on green product purchase intentions, in a B2C context.

        <p>Most studies on green procurement are grounded in the institutional theory (why firms engage in green buying) and the resourcebased view (how firms gain competitive advantage through green buying) (cf. Blome, Hollos, &amp; Paulraj, 2014). Literature has classified antecedents of green procurement into internal and external drivers (Ghosh, 2019). The adoption of green practices is often attributed to the need to gain societal legitimacy by complying with different external stakeholder pressures (e.g. Sarkis, Gonzalez-Torre, &amp; Adenso-Diaz, 2010). The aim of our study is not to further investigate different pressures from different stakeholder groups, but to focus on the impact of green marketing strategies on the satisfaction and loyalty of business customers. Companies may adapt their strategy by employing green marketing elements aimed at the environmental needs and wants of customers (Cheema, Durrani, Khokhar, &amp; Pasha, 2015). Little is known about the effectiveness of green marketing strategies in a B2B context, since most studies are positioned in a B2C context (e.g. Cheema, Durrani, Khokhar, &amp; Pasha, 2015;Rakhsha &amp; Majidazar, 2011;Ranaei Kordshouli, Ebrahimi, &amp; Allahyari Bouzanjani, 2015;Suki, 2016). The focus on consumer goods seems odd considering that most of the environmental resources are used in the production and manufacturing of goods for B2B markets (Kapitan, Kennedy, &amp; Berth, 2019).Most studies on green procurement are grounded in the institutional theory (why firms engage in green buying) and the resourcebased view (how firms gain competitive advantage through green buying) (cf.

        <p>The research question of this study is: What is the impact of green marketing on customer satisfaction and customer loyalty of professional buyers in a B2B setting? Based on a literature review, we developed a conceptual model with hypotheses that are tested with survey data collected from Dutch professional purchasers in the cleaning industry. The data analyses are done with partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM).The research question of this study is: What is the impact of green marketing on customer satisfaction and customer loyalty of professional buyers in a B2B setting?

        <p>Green products, also known as ecological and environmentally friendly products (Suki, 2017), aim at saving environmental resources, for example, by integrating recycled content or recycling in the production process (Chen &amp; Chai, 2010). Today's global environmental problems (e.g. environmental degradation, global warming, resource depletion, air and water pollution and habitat destruction) trigger both consumers and professional purchasers to consider green alternatives in their purchasing behaviour (Hsieh, 2012;Martinez, 2015).Green products, also known as ecological and environmentally friendly products (Suki, 2017), aim at saving environmental resources, for example, by integrating recycled content or recycling in the production process (Chen &amp; Chai, 2010).

        <p>Society has steadily increased its awareness of environmental issues, largely because of the high levels of environmental pollution caused by mass industrial manufacturing (Chen, 2011). Environmental concerns have become mainstream issues, urging companies to integrate sustainability into their (strategic) business activities (Molina-Azorín, Claver-Cortés, López-Gamero, &amp; Tarí, 2009). At the same time, various stakeholders as government, media, citizen groups and other stakeholders pressure firms to act to these environmental issues while implementing their activities (Kang &amp; Hur, 2012). People have become increasingly aware of the catastrophic ecological greenhouse gasses, resulting in global warming attributed partly to industrial activities (Chen, 2011). Therefore, more and more firms are prone to accept environmental protection as their social responsibility (Dwyer, 2009;Lee, 2009;Peattie, 1995). As a result, businesses started to adopt green marketing and procurement strategies (D'Souza, Taghian, Lamb, &amp; Peretiatkos, 2006). Satisfying green customers with green products is at the heart of green marketing (Liu, Kasturiratne, &amp; Moizer, 2012). Green product innovation has been recognized as an important issue for companies in both B2C and B2B markets.Society has steadily increased its awareness of environmental issues, largely because of the high levels of environmental pollution caused by mass industrial manufacturing (Chen, 2011).

        <p>Many studies have emphasized the critical role of supplier collaboration and supplier integration in green product innovation (e.g. Carballo-Penela, Mateo-Mantecón, Alvarez, &amp; Castromán-Diz, 2018;Du, Zhang, &amp; Feng, 2018;Melander, 2018). Within supply chain context, the integration of stakeholder pressure to become green or sustainable leads to further integrating practices of green supply chain management or sustainable supply chain management.Many studies have emphasized the critical role of supplier collaboration and supplier integration in green product innovation (e.g. Carballo-Penela, Mateo-Mantecón, Alvarez, &amp; Castromán-Diz, 2018;Du, Zhang, &amp; Feng, 2018;Melander, 2018).

        <p>Definitions and conceptualizations of green and sustainable supply chain management differ (e.g. Lambrechts, 2021); however, research has shown that environmental misconduct of supply chain partners negatively impacts the focal company's reputation (Veit, Lambrechts, Quintens, &amp; Semeijn, 2018). It has also been shown that green supply chain management has a positive impact on the environmental performance of companies (cf. Silva, Gomes, &amp; Sarkis, 2019). Similar to the research regarding green marketing, the concept of green supply chain management remains understudied in B2B context (Hoejmose, Brammer, &amp; Millington, 2012). Furthermore, aligning (green) marketing and (green) supply chain management, for example, through conceptualization of demand chain management is an important issue in enhancing green strategies (Brindley &amp; Oxborrow, 2014), hence the importance to focus on buyer-supplier relations.Definitions and conceptualizations of green and sustainable supply chain management differ (e.g. Lambrechts, 2021); however, research has shown that environmental misconduct of supply chain partners negatively impacts the focal company's reputation (Veit, Lambrechts, Quintens, &amp; Semeijn, 2018).

        <p>Green products are often perceived as low-value products that do not really deliver on their environmental promises (Chen &amp; Chang, 2012). Professional buyers are unlikely to compromise on traditional product attributes such as, price, quality, value and performance. Green products should match up to the attributes from non-green products to be attractive to customers. Early research in this field, all incorporated a B2C context, recommend a wider range of sampling (other countries, other cultural values, other industries) and adding new variables/antecedents as possible drivers of green customer satisfaction (Chang &amp; Fong, 2010;Martinez, 2015;Suki, 2017). The available research on the drivers of green B2B marketing focusses on a limited number of antecedents, that is, disasters, public opinion, legislation and scientific evidence, while only limited research exits on the impact of overall marketing strategy elements (cf. Sharma, 2020). This study focusses on the satisfaction and loyalty of professional buyers with green product offerings. More specifically, we will investigate the linkages between antecedents, green customer satisfaction and green customer loyalty in a B2B context.Green products are often perceived as low-value products that do not really deliver on their environmental promises (Chen &amp; Chang, 2012).

        <p>Many studies have investigated antecedents and outcomes of customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. Satisfaction and loyalty are generally considered as critically important concepts for practical and theoretical purposes (e.g. Jamal, 2004). Prior research paid much attention to satisfaction and loyalty of consumers in general. Far less studies have investigated satisfaction and loyalty of professional purchasers in relation to green and environmental concerns (e.g. Ranaei Kordshouli, Ebrahimi, &amp; Allahyari Bouzanjani, 2015).Many studies have investigated antecedents and outcomes of customer satisfaction and customer loyalty.

        <p>Chang and Fong (2010) introduced the concepts of 'green customer satisfaction' and 'green customer loyalty' that proved to be useful for studying green buying behaviour (e.g. Asgharian, Salehi, Saleki, Hojabri, &amp; Nikkheslat, 2012;Cheema, Durrani, Khokhar, &amp; Pasha, 2015;Ranaei Kordshouli, Ebrahimi, &amp; Allahyari Bouzanjani, 2015;Saeednia &amp; Valahzaghard, 2012).Chang and Fong (2010) introduced the concepts of 'green customer satisfaction' and 'green customer loyalty' that proved to be useful for studying green buying behaviour (e.g. Asgharian, Salehi, Saleki, Hojabri, &amp; Nikkheslat, 2012;Cheema, Durrani, Khokhar, &amp; Pasha, 2015;Ranaei Kordshouli, Ebrahimi, &amp; Allahyari Bouzanjani, 2015;Saeednia &amp; Valahzaghard, 2012).</p>
        <p>Customer loyalty is most commonly referred to as a strong commitment to rebuy a product in the future (Oliver, 1999). The intention to repurchase positions loyalty from a behavioural perspective, whereas attitudinal loyalty emphasizes the emotional bond with and a strong preference for a certain brand or product (e.g. Uncles, Dowling, &amp; Hammond, 2003). The attitudinal conceptualization is often preferred in research, since it 'goes beyond overt behaviour and expresses loyalty in terms of (…) affection' (Mechinda, Serirat, &amp; Gulid, 2009, p. 131). This study will capture aspects of both behavioural and attitudinal loyalty (cf. Chang &amp; Fong, 2010). Green customer loyalty refers to the customer's desire to maintain a relationship with an institute which has environmental or green concerns and the customer's commitment to rebuy a preferred product on a regular basis in the future (cf. Asgharian, Salehi, Saleki, Hojabri, &amp; Nikkheslat, 2012;Chang &amp; Fong, 2010). Similarly, we can define green customer satisfaction as an overall pleasurable fulfilment of some customer's needs, goals and desires about environmental or green concerns (cf. Chang &amp; Fong, 2010). Exceeding or matching prior expectations is of critical importance for (green) customer satisfaction (e.g. Suki, 2017).Customer loyalty is most commonly referred to as a strong commitment to rebuy a product in the future (Oliver, 1999).

        <p>Many studies have investigated and confirmed a positive relationship between customer satisfaction and customer loyalty in industrial markets (e.g. Biedenbach, Bengtsson, &amp; Marell, 2015;Butcher, Sparks, &amp; O'Callaghan, 2002;Da Silva &amp; Alwi, 2006;Elsäßer &amp; Wirtz, 2017;Fornell, Mithas, Morgenson, &amp; Krishnan, 2006;Gountas &amp; Gountas, 2007;Zboja &amp; Voorhees, 2006). Obviously, satisfied customers are more likely to rebuy a product or service compared to non-satisfied or less satisfied customers (e.g. Oliver, 1999). However, few studies have examined the positive effect of green customer satisfaction on green customer loyalty (Chang &amp; Fong, 2010;Martinez, 2015).

        <p>Green product quality is reflected by its environmental characteristics and benefits (Ali, Khan, Ahmed, &amp; Shahzad, 2011). Examples of green attributes are eco-labelling, non-polluting materials, recyclability, high energy conservation and a general assurance of limited environmental impacts (Tseng &amp; Hung, 2013). According to Chang and Fong (2010), green product quality can be defined as 'the dimensions of product features, product design and product package that are involved in energy-saving, pollution prevention, waste recycling and being environmentally friendly' (p. 2839). Customer decisions are influenced by the knowledge of the quality of green products (cf. Mayer, 2013;Norazah, 2013;Suki, 2016). Studies have reported a direct impact on performance and a close link with green customer satisfaction and customer loyalty (e.g. Chang &amp; Fong, 2010;Chen &amp; Chang, 2013;Suki, 2017).

        <p>The green imperative has resulted in much awareness for environmental concerns. These concerns in their turn have contributed to an increased demand for green and eco-friendly products (e.g. Suki, 2016). Green products can be more costly (Agyeman, 2014), for instance, due to 'supplementary costs oriented on environment protection' (C atoiu, Vrânceanu, &amp; Filip, 2010, p. 119).

Obviously, not all customers are willing or able to pay more money for green or environmentally friendly products (Agyeman, 2014;Cheema, Durrani, Khokhar, &amp; Pasha, 2015). Customers require price fairness, in the sense that the perceived (environmental) value matches a relatively high price (cf. C atoiu, Vrânceanu, &amp; Filip, 2010). Customers are less sensitive to price when a (green) product is believed to contribute to sustainable development.

Customers are less sensitive to price when a (green) product is believed to contribute to sustainable development. Organizational buyers are reluctant to pay high prices whenever they view green or recycled products, such as paper, to be of lower quality (Sharma &amp; Iyer, 2012).</p>
        <p>In this study, we follow Konuk (2018) who defines product price as 'the customer's assessment and associated emotions of whether the difference between a seller's price and the price of a comparative other party is reasonable, acceptable, or justifiable' (p.142). Green product prices can play an ambiguous role in the purchasing process.In this study, we follow Konuk (2018) who defines product price as 'the customer's assessment and associated emotions of whether the difference between a seller's price and the price of a comparative other party is reasonable, acceptable, or justifiable' (p.142).

        <p>A high price can be viewed as 'a high sacrifice' but at the same time as 'a cue for high quality' (Grewal, Monroe, &amp; Krishnan, 1998). Given the customer intentions to obtain reliable information, including product price, about environmental concerns (Ganapathy, Natarajan, Gunasekaran, &amp; Subramanian, 2014;Thongplew, Spaargaren, &amp; Koppen, 2014), customers are willing to spend more money for environmentally friendly products and services as they understand their environmental knowledge influence their ecological behaviour (Juwaheer, Pudaruth, &amp; Noyaux, 2012;Norazah, 2013). Goebel, Reuter, Pibernik, Sichtmann and Bals (2018) found that purchasing managers are willing to pay higher prices to companies that meet basis responsibilities to people and planet by complying with the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) principles. We posit that professional purchasers are well aware of the logic and need for companies to ask higher prices for green products. We therefore hypothesize a positive association between green product prices and customer satisfaction and customer loyalty.A high price can be viewed as 'a high sacrifice' but at the same time as 'a cue for high quality' (Grewal, Monroe, &amp; Krishnan, 1998).

        <p>The corporate image of a company refers to a general impression, as perceived by its stakeholders (Dowling, 2004). The corporate image reflects the features of a company in the perception of stakeholders (Van Riel &amp; Fombrun, 2007). Obviously, the green corporate image relates to environmental features of a company (Amores-Salvadó, Martín-de Castro, &amp; Navas-López, 2014). A positive, strong green corporate image lays the foundation for the environmental legitimacy of companies (Chen, Lai, &amp; Wen, 2006;Hunter &amp; Bansal, 2006). Many studies reported that corporate image is positively linked to customer satisfaction and customer loyalty (e.g. Professional purchasers represent organizations, although they are also individuals, seeking not only organizational performance but also their own personal and professional success (Webster &amp; Keller, 2004). Industrial buyers may therefore be sensitive to brands and corporate image (Viardot, 2017). Professional buyers are on alert for greenwashing, that is, when a supplier spends more time, energy and money in claiming to be green instead of taking actual sustainability initiatives (Kapitan, Kennedy, &amp; Berth, 2019). Greenwashing is an example of misleading communication, aimed at forming overly positive attitudes of various stakeholders (Torelli, Balluchi, &amp; Lazzini, 2020) about an organization's environmental performance, practice or products (Lyon &amp; Montgomery, 2015).The corporate image of a company refers to a general impression, as perceived by its stakeholders (Dowling, 2004).

        <p>Companies may be tempted to engage in greenwashing to obtain legitimacy and to improve perceived corporate environmental responsibility (e.g. Torelli, Balluchi, &amp; Lazzini, 2020). Purchasers often have to rely on their own subjective perceptions concerning suppliers' actual sustainability (e.g. Chamorro, Rubio, &amp; Miranda, 2009;Simula, Lehtimäki, &amp; Salo, 2009). In general, the perceptions of professional purchasers about environmental and social sustainability have a major impact on organization buying decisions (cf. Kapitan, Kennedy, &amp; Berth, 2019).

        <p>Green customer loyalty refers to three dimensions of behavioural intentions, namely, purchase intentions, word-of-mouth intentions and willingness to pay (premium). These three dimensions of behavioural intentions were used to reflect green customer loyalty, which was measured through three validated items from Suki (2017), Chang and Fong (2010) and Reid and Reid (1993).Green customer loyalty refers to three dimensions of behavioural intentions, namely, purchase intentions, word-of-mouth intentions and willingness to pay (premium).

        <p>The literature review revealed that green product quality is about a product dimension of features, design and package that are involved in energy saving, pollution prevention, waste recycling and being environmentally friendly.

        <p>Since our main aim is to identify the most important antecedents of our target constructs green customer satisfaction and green customer loyalty, PLS-SEM is a more appropriate approach analysing our data than CB-SEM, the latter which is primarily used to confirm or reject theories (Sarstedt, Ringle, Smith, Reams, &amp; Hair, 2014). Non-normality of our data and the use of a small sample size further favour the use of PLS-SEM since PLS-SEM makes practically no assumptions about the underlying data and generally achieves higher levels of statistical power in spite of a limited sample size (Hair, Hult, Ringle, &amp; Sarstedt, 2017).Since our main aim is to identify the most important antecedents of our target constructs green customer satisfaction and green customer loyalty, PLS-SEM is a more appropriate approach analysing our data than CB-SEM, the latter which is primarily used to confirm or reject theories (Sarstedt, Ringle, Smith, Reams, &amp; Hair, 2014).

        <p>In the first stage of our evaluation, we assess the measures which in Next, we examine the discriminant validity of our constructs. A conservative indication for discriminant validity is provided by the Fornell and Larcker (1981) criterion. As can be concluded from Table 2, the Fornell and Larcker (1981) criterion has been met, suggesting satisfactory discriminant validity. Another approach to assess discriminant validity is to examine the HTMT values (Henseler, Ringle, &amp; Sarstedt, 2015), which are also provided in Table 2. From Table 2, it can be seen that all HTMT values are well below the suggested threshold value of 0.85, providing further evidence of discriminant validity.In the first stage of our evaluation, we assess the measures which in Next, we examine the discriminant validity of our constructs.

        <p>For assessing our structural model for potential collinearity issues, we evaluate the inner variance inflation factor (VIF). Inner VIF values in our study range from a minimum of 1.000 to a maximum of 1.582. Since these inner VIF values are well below the suggested threshold value of 5 (Hair, Hult, Ringle, &amp; Sarstedt, 2017), there is no indication for potential collinearity between the measurement models. Therefore, we continue assessing the model's quality by reviewing the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) and the structural path coefficients (betas). The R 2 values for green customer satisfaction and green customer loyalty are 0.541 and 0.605, respectively (see Figure 2) and may be considered moderate (Hair, Hult, Ringle, &amp; Sarstedt, 2017;Sarstedt, Ringle, Smith, Reams, &amp; Hair, 2014). Table 3 includes the strength and significance of the structural path coefficients. Table 3 shows that all structural relationships are found significant.For assessing our structural model for potential collinearity issues, we evaluate the inner variance inflation factor (VIF).

        <p>Besides the direct effects as summarized in Table 3 and presented in Figure 2, we also consider the total effects of the four exogenous constructs on the endogenous target construct green customer loyalty (see Table 4). The total effect represents the total influence of an exogenous construct on the target construct, thus including the influence through mediating construct green customer satisfaction. The results indicate that green customer satisfaction is a crucial mediator in the effects of the four antecedents on green customer loyalty.Besides the direct effects as summarized in Table 3 and presented in Figure 2, we also consider the total effects of the four exogenous constructs on the endogenous target construct green customer loyalty (see Table 4).

However, almost no studies to date investigated the effects of possible drivers for satisfaction and loyalty in a green and B2B context. The of this study was to examine the influences of green marketing strategy elements (i.e. green corporate image, green product price, green product quality and salesperson's green expertise) on satisfaction in the B2B context. The results provided support for our hypotheses. The four antecedents (quality, price, corporate image and salesperson's expertise) all demonstrated positive significant relationships with green customer satisfaction. As expected, we found a strong positive relationship between green customer satisfaction and green customer loyalty in B2B context.Salesperson's green expertise 0.436 0.17 than ever for companies (Chen, 2011;Dwyer, 2009;Lee, 2009;Lim, 2016;Peattie, 1995).

        <p>The findings have practical relevance for companies and organizations. In addition, policymakers and regulatory agencies could benefit from the results of our study. In addition to the development and implementation of regulations, these agencies could acknowledge the impact of green marketing on (industrial) customers. Enhanced awareness about the environment is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for enhanced green buying behaviour in business markets.The findings have practical relevance for companies and organizations.

        <p>The implementation of environmental management practices is often regarded among practitioners as the fulfilment of a need to comply with rules and regulations. Our study posits the idea that professional buyers can be seduced and convinced to buy green by the marketing efforts of supplying companies. Moreover, our study confirms that both professional sellers and professional buyers have an important role in the pursuit of environmental practices by companies in B2B settings. Our study underlines the need for and the effectiveness of green marketing for environmental purposes.The implementation of environmental management practices is often regarded among practitioners as the fulfilment of a need to comply with rules and regulations.

        <p>Companies should acknowledge that they are influenced by the marketing efforts of their suppliers. Professional buyers may be inclined to think that they are in the position to 'manage suppliers' and to 'develop suppliers'. The reality is most commonly less clearcut. Whether consciously or unconsciously, buyers will always be the marketing target of supplying companies. Our results confirm that a green marketing strategy may actually contribute to the (green) satisfaction of the professional purchaser. The personal attention from a competent and knowledgeable salesperson appears to be quite effective and influential when it comes to satisfaction and loyalty.Companies should acknowledge that they are influenced by the marketing efforts of their suppliers.

        <p>A green image and a green product quality contribute significantly to the satisfaction of their customers. Even a positive relationship was found between prices and satisfaction, indicating that buyers are willing to pay higher prices for green(er) products of high quality. Most importantly, even in a digital age where online tools are predominantly present, suppliers should not underestimate the importance of their salesforce. The human factor in B2B relationships, as represented by the knowledge and experience salespersons, appears to be decisive in satisfying the green needs and requirements of their customers.A green image and a green product quality contribute significantly to the satisfaction of their customers.

        <p>Companies should realize that customer satisfaction is the key for any (improvement of) customer loyalty. Third, we investigated the impact of green marketing on (green) customer satisfaction of professional buyers in a B2B setting. Future research could focus on the role of managerial and personal attitudes towards the environment and their impact on environmental buying behaviours (cf. Knight, Megicks, Agarwal, &amp; Leenders, 2019). Most commonly, organizational buying behaviour has been considered 'a rational activity, even though humans are involved in the decisionmaking' (Kemp, Borders, Anaza, &amp; Johnston, 2018, p. 19). As a result, personal attitudes and emotions are largely overlooked and understudied in research on organizational buying behaviour. Here are promising avenues for further research in the area of green marketing and green customer satisfaction in B2B markets.Companies should realize that customer satisfaction is the key for any (improvement of) customer loyalty.

        <p>Fourth, in most studies, quality usually consists out of a service quality aspect and a product quality aspect. In this study, we primarily focussed on product quality which gives other researchers the possibility to take the service quality aspect into account for future research. A related suggestion is to include the variable 'trust'. In other green (B2C) studies, trust proved to be an important influencer loyalty (Konuk, 2018;Konuk, Rahman, &amp; Salo, 2015;Martinez, 2015). We focussed on the impact of the green marketing strategy elements on customer satisfaction. Other performance variables could be included, such the green core competence and the competitive advantage of companies (cf. Chen, 2008). Future research could also incorporate and investigate the influence of social sustainability (cf. Lim, 2016), for example, social aspects such as labour conditions, charity and sponsorships. To conclude, there are still many other factors which can influence the satisfaction of professional buyers; therefore, we recommend adding new variables as possible drivers of green customer satisfaction.Fourth, in most studies, quality usually consists out of a service quality aspect and a product quality aspect.
