        <p>"Strategy" is the main concept of the contemporary era [1] that has come to replace previous management activities such as "administration" or "planification." According to [2,3], the meaning of the word strategy originated in the military field and comes from the word "strategos" meaning general in Greek. rough time, its meaning has been evolving, being applied to other human activities and, in particular, to business strategies. One of the main problems for their business strategists is the understanding of the competitive environment and the interpretation of the effects of the competition in a business [4]; in consequence for the research studies the time to strengthen again the study of the categories and the competition in the investigation of the strategic management (SM) has come. e concept of strategy over time has been addressed by several authors. One of them is Chandler [5], who proposes that the strategy is the definition of the long-term goals and objectives of a company, the adoptions of actions, and the allocation of necessary resources for the achievement of the objectives. For Andrews [6], the strategy is the model of the objectives, policies, purposes, goals, and plans to achieve them addressed in such a way that they define in which business the company is or will be. According to Porter [7], the strategy is to select the set of activities in which a company stands out to establish a sustainable difference in the market; the differentiation arises of the activities chosen and how they are the carried out."Strategy" is the main concept of the contemporary era [1] that has come to replace previous management activities such as "administration" or "planification."

        <p>Initially as a complement to the study of the strategies from the mechanistic perspective, researchers as [5][6][7]9] consider that strategies are static, reductionist, and synchronic with only one occurrence in time. Contemporaneously, a new wave of research studies was born that approach to the study of the theory of behavior and organization [10][11][12][13][14][15][16], and these authors point out that the strategy is a coalignment or an adaptive coordination of various states and trajectories.Initially as a complement to the study of the strategies from the mechanistic perspective, researchers as [5][6][7]9] consider that strategies are static, reductionist, and synchronic with only one occurrence in time.

        <p>According to Chiavenato [17], there are four fundamental elements in the strategy which together make a whole. e mission is the answer to the question what is the organization for. e business to which the organization is dedicated is defined, the needs that are covered with its products and services, the market in which the company is developed, as well as the public image of the company or organization. e vision is the answer to the question what do we want the organization to be in the next years. e future situation that the company wants to have is defined and described. e purpose of the vision is to guide, control, and encourage the organization as a whole in order to achieve the desirable state of the organization. e values define the set of principles, beliefs, and rules that regulate the management of the organization. Global objectives indicate the results that are wanted to be achieved in a specific period of time. ese elements constitute the institutional philosophy and the support of the organizational culture [18]. e basic objective of the definition of corporate values is to have a reference framework that inspires and regulates the life of the organization.According to Chiavenato [17], there are four fundamental elements in the strategy which together make a whole. e mission is the answer to the question what is the organization for. e business to which the organization is dedicated is defined, the needs that are covered with its products and services, the market in which the company is developed, as well as the public image of the company or organization. e vision is the answer to the question what do we want the organization to be in the next years. e future situation that the company wants to have is defined and described. e purpose of the vision is to guide, control, and encourage the organization as a whole in order to achieve the desirable state of the organization. e values define the set of principles, beliefs, and rules that regulate the management of the organization.

        <p>It is responsible for conceiving the global direction of the organization. e classic approach of the strategic formulation is based on the rational methods of planning, resource allocation, and profitability. For Chandler [5], the structure follows the strategy. If the strategic plan is defined, the appropriate structure arises easily. According to Ansoff [26], this approach places great confidence in the hierarchy or scorecard and trusts in the intelligence and ability of the leaders to adopt strategies that maximize long-term benefits; the control and knowledge are competence of the executive director. is approach requires a transformational leadership, considered as the most effective way of leadership in all the array of models; this comprises four types of behaviors: intellectual stimulation, motivation, commitment, and effort, that culminate in better performance [27]. Porter [28] indicates that the process of a competitive strategy is the development of the wide formula of how a company is going to compete, which must be their objectives (mission or objective) and which policies will be needed to carry out those goals. According to Sloan [29], for the classic approach, the progress and stability of the business depends largely on the development or creation of strategies.It is responsible for conceiving the global direction of the organization. e classic approach of the strategic formulation is based on the rational methods of planning, resource allocation, and profitability.

        <p>e importance of each specialization of the strategy is recognized, stating that it should be independent of the execution policies. e evolutionary approach raises the inability to generate strategies from inside; according to [30,31], this approach proposes that the organizations are drifting of the changes of the external environment and depends on the magnitude of it, that is the market which defines the strategy, being this in charge of guaranteeing the minimal or maximum benefits. According to Freeman and Hannan [32], the organizational selection processes favor them and the organizations that can change the strategy and the structure as their environment change.e importance of each specialization of the strategy is recognized, stating that it should be independent of the execution policies. e evolutionary approach raises the inability to generate strategies from inside; according to [30,31], this approach proposes that the organizations are drifting of the changes of the external environment and depends on the magnitude of it, that is the market which defines the strategy, being this in charge of guaranteeing the minimal or maximum benefits.

        <p>Following this approach, Peters and Waterman [33] state that the keys of excellence have to do with focusing on people, clients, and action. e eight principles for the excellence, proposed by these authors, allow any manager to make a diagnosis and evaluate its performance. ese state that the application of these principles give the necessary clues for managers to convert their companies in organizations of excellence both in operation as in results. In the same way, supported on the evolutionary approach, Williamson [34] states that the strategy in the classic sense of rational planning oriented to the future is often irrelevant; this assertion is supported by Gotcheva et al. [35] who states that the organizations that better adapt to the environment are the ones that survive, even though in reality it seems to be that environment has adapted to them.Following this approach, Peters and Waterman [33] state that the keys of excellence have to do with focusing on people, clients, and action. e eight principles for the excellence, proposed by these authors, allow any manager to make a diagnosis and evaluate its performance. ese state that the application of these principles give the necessary clues for managers to convert their companies in organizations of excellence both in operation as in results.

        <p>e systemic approach gives the capacity to the organizations of planning and acting effectively in their environments, it is relativistic. According to Granovetter [36] following the approach about the social incorporation of the economic activity, the systemic vision proposes the objectives of the strategy to be designed depending on the context of the social system in which it is developed, understanding that the strategies must be sensitive to the sociologic environment of the organizations which guides the strategy are particularities of a concrete sociological environment. According to Granovetter [37], a central principle of the systemic theory is to observe the decision makers as complex individuals, whose decisions are not based exclusively on economical conceptions, and understand the interrelation of the multiple variables of the society and its effect with the environment. Following the systemic approach, Whitley [38] states that a central principle of the economic sociology is that culture and the regulatory institutions help to constitute the nature of the economic actors and guide their actions, thus affecting the economic results.e systemic approach gives the capacity to the organizations of planning and acting effectively in their environments, it is relativistic.

        <p>According to Clegg et al. [39], the processualist approach shows the same skepticism as evolutionists regarding strategic rationality; they rely less on the capacity of the market to guarantee obtaining maximum benefits.

        <p>It is the complement of the general strategy. Its application corresponds to the leader or director. e roles of senior management and the management of organizational projects are an essential part in the effective implementation of the company's strategy [47]. At directive level, this strategy is used as a mean to perform various functions, serving as support in decision making and carry out coordination processes and communication of goals or the strategic purpose. According to Galbreath [48], any business strategy must incorporate in an effective way the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR). According to Bento et al. [49], CSR is necessary if developing competitive advantages is wanted in the current environment. Lee et al., Lindgreen and Swaen and Maon et al., [50][51][52] define CSR as a way of directing organizations based on the management of the impacts that its activity generates on its clients, employees, shareholders, local communities, environment, and society in general. SM implies the formulation and implementation of the main objectives and initiatives adopted by the senior managers of a company, in relation to owners, based on the consideration of the resources, and an evaluation of the external and internal environment in which the organization competes [53]. us, it should have at least five attributes to be a business strategy [54]: (1) be measurable, (2) clarity in the objectives, (3) resource consumption, (4) assignment of responsible, and (5) that it can be checked. Companies now focus more on exploitation of external resources such as customers, rather than internal efficiency, to gain new competitive advantages. People's ideas are fed by brands, and this exercise provides the opportunity to cocreate products in collaboration with customers [55,56].It is the complement of the general strategy.

        <p>According to Peppard and Ward [57], any organizational strategy must define where the company wants to be in the future and evaluate objectively where it is now to decide how to get there; taking into account the options, alternatives, available resources, and the needed changes. A company achieves a superior profitability in its industry when achieving higher prices or lower costs than its competitors; this is achieved through the operative effectiveness or the strategic positioning [58]. For Rumelt [59], a good strategy is a coherent set of analysis, concepts, policies, arguments, and actions that give responses to a high-risk challenge. e strategies based on the costs have been considered among the generic forms of strategic positioning [60,61].According to Peppard and Ward [57], any organizational strategy must define where the company wants to be in the future and evaluate objectively where it is now to decide how to get there; taking into account the options, alternatives, available resources, and the needed changes.

        <p>According to Reitzig and Maciejovsky [62], the creation of a strategy is not only a task for the executives; on the contrary, the definition of the business approaches and new measures to initiate, involve all the hierarchy levels of the organization (head of business unit, heads of products, heads of functional areas within a business or division, administrators, and supervisors). e academics and professionals are more and more interested in the concept of sustainability (integrated measure of the economic, social, and environmental performance) [63]. For Iazzolino and Laise [64], the strategies must be socially sustainable, creating value not only for the shareholder but also for the other interested, for the employees. According to Radomska [65], the sustainability issues in the strategies are becoming a natural element of the business policies, and their actions are important for the business of the company and for the financial result, as to cost reduction, cleaner production, gas reduction, and so on [66]. For supply change management, the sustainability is an important issue, creating a new age of business thinking and a source of competitive advantage [67,68].According to Reitzig and Maciejovsky [62], the creation of a strategy is not only a task for the executives; on the contrary, the definition of the business approaches and new measures to initiate, involve all the hierarchy levels of the organization (head of business unit, heads of products, heads of functional areas within a business or division, administrators, and supervisors). e academics and professionals are more and more interested in the concept of sustainability (integrated measure of the economic, social, and environmental performance) [63].

        <p>In general, to create strategies, authors such as Král and Králová [69] suggest that all starts from the analysis of the environment surrounding the company, pretending with it the proposition of action plans, aimed at improving competitiveness. According to Nikulin and Becker [70], in order to analyze the situation in which a company is found, the most commonly used is the SWOT analysis, which allows to determine strengths and opportunities of the company as well as the weaknesses and threats that the market offers in the scope of its business.

        <p>For Hussein et al. [72], another concept to be kept in mind when generating strategies, considered a key factor in the organization performance, is the organizational learning capacity. According to Mallén et al. [73], the application of this concept allows to analyze the relation between the degree of organization structure, performance of the organization, and the learning capacity of the organization. For Norashikin and Ishak [74], an organization with organizational learning culture improves significantly the competitive advantages, allowing to survive in a competitive world [75]; in the same way it provides improvements in the performance of the companies supported by the concept of transactional organizational learning, and this mechanism allows the organizations to keep the knowledge and transmit it to specialists for the generation or rethink of new rules [76]. J. Power and D. Waddell and D. Coghlan [77,78] analyzed the relation between self-managed work and the organizational learning capacity as indicators of performance in the improvement of the innovative capacities of the companies.For Hussein et al.

[73], the application of this concept allows to analyze the relation between the degree of organization structure, performance of the organization, and the learning capacity of the organization. For Norashikin and Ishak [74], an organization with organizational learning culture improves significantly the competitive advantages, allowing to survive in a competitive world [75]; in the same way it provides improvements in the performance of the companies supported by the concept of transactional organizational learning, and this mechanism allows the organizations to keep the knowledge and transmit it to specialists for the generation or rethink of new rules [76]. J. Power and D. Waddell and D. Coghlan [77,78] analyzed the relation between self-managed work and the organizational learning capacity as indicators of performance in the improvement of the innovative capacities of the companies.</p>

        <p>Good organizational structures act as moderators for improving the influence that leaders have about the behavior, performance, and work of their subordinates, in search of the satisfaction of the client [81]. Different authors have defined the concept of organizational structure. For Mintzberg [82], all are the patterns of design to organize a company, taking into account all the forms in which work is divided and the subsequent coordination of the same, searching to meet the proposed goals and to achieve the objectives set. For Strategor and Anastassopoulos [83], an organizational structure is the set of responsibilities and relations that formally determine the functions that each unit must accomplish and the way of communication between each work team. Chin [84] made an evaluation of how the leadership of men and women influence in the organizational structures, this author states that skills of men and women gain similar legitimacy, but when an organization fails, the perception of competence of women leaders, the status, and the interpersonal skills fall more than those of men. Note: strategic logic: statistical models for analysis of strategic results. Empirical evidence: strategic regulations to indicate better strategic solutions. Adjustment or adequacy organizational: alternatives (organizational design, human resources policy, management style, and organizational culture) for adjustment and strategic adaptation.Good organizational structures act as moderators for improving the influence that leaders have about the behavior, performance, and work of their subordinates, in search of the satisfaction of the client [81].

        <p>When an organization is in different business, the planning can be facilitated by creating a strategic business unit (SBU). SBU represents a unique business or a group of business related, for which is possible to formulate a common strategy. Each SBU will have its own distinctive mission and different competitors; this allows it to have an independent strategy from the other business of the organization. [106], this strategy is close to the definition of processes and actions, that is, it responds to how things must be done or how must be used and applied to the resources. e functional strategy depends and must be well defined and aligned with the corporative and the business strategies. According to Sharma and Fisher [107], the main types of functional strategies are: production strategies [108], I + D strategies [109], marketing strategies [110], human resources strategies [111,112], technological strategies [113], organizational strategies [114], and financial strategies [115]. It is considered that the production strategy has been the most effective in the past and will continue to receive the maximum priority in the next years. In general, continuing with the order of importance are the technological strategy and the human resources strategy. e I + D strategy is the second highest in importance in the last few years. Not all the companies can apply it; it requires a lot of balance, capital, coordination, and processing of information; conflict of authority; possibility of disunity between the command; stress among their members; high bureaucratic and operation costs; requires an effective manager in human relations; and scarce definition of priorities and use of resources.When an organization is in different business, the planning can be facilitated by creating a strategic business unit (SBU).

        <p>According to Hansen and Schaltegger [176], in the year 1992, BSC was presented in the Harvard Business Review, and the creators of this concept are Robert Kaplan and David Norton [177]. Initially, BSC focused on indicators of individual and group performance to measure and manage the implementation of the strategic objectives [178]. Different authors have given definitions of BSC; for Srivastava et al. [179], it is a method to measure the activities of a company in terms of its vision and strategy, providing the administrators a global view of the business performance. For Kaplan and Norton [180], BSC is a system of manager management that directs attention points in the organization. Its purpose is to translate the strategy in measures that only communicate their vision to the organization.According to Hansen and Schaltegger [176], in the year 1992, BSC was presented in the Harvard Business Review, and the creators of this concept are Robert Kaplan and David Norton [177].

        <p>A subject that acquires a lot of criticism in the system of measurement of the performance is its static nature. As a consequence, an increasing current of authors consider that the surroundings of static measurement are not suitable for this time. According to the state by [194][195][196], the classic BSC, stated by Kaplan and Norton, have deficiencies in organizations where its business has dynamic systems, where the interested parties define the performance in different ways (chains of commercial supply, humanitarian logistics). Norreklit [208] states that BSC has a linear vision of the cause-effect relations among the indicators in the strategic map; moreover, for Brignall [197], the relations cause-effect in BSC are an excessive simplification of the reality since this set of relations is recursive and dynamic. For Linard and Dvorsky [198], BSC presents a lack of clear formalization of the delay in time between the main indicators and the straggled; for Barnabè [202], BSC presents limited support as rigorous mechanism of validation and analysis of scenarios of the relations between the performance indicators, that is, the relations between the KPI in the strategic map do not express the dynamic relations.A subject that acquires a lot of criticism in the system of measurement of the performance is its static nature.

Norreklit [208] states that BSC has a linear vision of the cause-effect relations among the indicators in the strategic map; moreover, for Brignall [197], the relations cause-effect in BSC are an excessive simplification of the reality since this set of relations is recursive and dynamic. For Linard and Dvorsky [198], BSC presents a lack of clear formalization of the delay in time between the main indicators and the straggled; for Barnabè [202], BSC presents limited support as rigorous mechanism of validation and analysis of scenarios of the relations between the performance indicators, that is, the relations between the KPI in the strategic map do not express the dynamic relations.</p>

Kaplan and Norton [193] pose that BSC is not only a measurement system of strategic control, able to manage the problem of the implementation of the strategy. However, Simons [215] argues that BSC is a hierarchic falling model that is not rooted in the organization or the environment, so it is questionable as a tool of strategic control and points out that there exists a barrier between the strategy expressed in the plan proposed by the manager and the strategy expressed in the really started actions. Van Veen-Dirks and Wijn [210] affirm that BSC gives an inadequate feedback about the strategy content and does not give enough information about the external surroundings.Skills gap (staff) [171,180,185,188,189,191,[205][206][207][208][209][210][211] Development of skills Retention of key personnel Application of technologies and added value Cycle of decision making Availability and use of strategic information Progress in system of strategic information Personnel satisfaction Organizational climate [203,204] propose dynamic BSC models that are supported in the dynamic of systems, as an improvement of the classic BSC model. e dynamic of system is a computer-assisted method that helps to understand the behavior of complex systems, and these techniques use tools such as diagrams of causal cycles, time delays, and stocks [214].
