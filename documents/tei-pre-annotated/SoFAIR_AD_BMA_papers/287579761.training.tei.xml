        <p>The joint optimisation of investments in capacity and repair capability of production and logistics systems at risk of being damaged is an important aspect of supply chain resilience that is not sufficiently addressed by state-of-the-art modelling approaches. Furthermore, logistical issues of procuring repair resources impact speed of recovery but are not considered in most existing models. This paper presents a novel multi-stage stochastic programming model that optimizes pre-disruption investment decisions, as well as post-disruption dynamic adjustment of supply chain operations and allocation of repair resources. A case study demonstrates how the method can quantify the effects of pooling repair resources.The joint optimisation of investments in capacity and repair capability of production and logistics systems at risk of being damaged is an important aspect of supply chain resilience that is not sufficiently addressed by state-of-the-art modelling approaches.

        <p>Global sourcing, just-in-time logistics and lean production methods keep costs low in stable business environments but can increase risks and uncertainties when disruptions occur (Fiksel et al., 2015). Traditional supply chain risk management (SCRM) methods focus on identifying, avoiding and controlling risks (Heckmann et al., 2015;Ho et al., 2015). However, rising complexity, interconnectedness and uncertainty make the application of such methods increasingly difficult (Simichi-Levi et al., 2013). Furthermore, global efforts to reduce the environmental impact of supply chains have been found to also make them more sensitive to disruptions (Fahimnia et al., 2018).Global sourcing, just-in-time logistics and lean production methods keep costs low in stable business environments but can increase risks and uncertainties when disruptions occur (Fiksel et al., 2015).

        <p>In response, supply chain resilience planning seeks to minimize the overall disruption impacts by achieving a balance of robustness, redundancy and recovery capabilities (Ponomarov and Holcomb, 2009;Tukamuhabwa et al., 2015;Kamalahmadi and Mellat Parast, 2016). The increasing importance of strengthening the resilience of supply chains is also recognised by international organisations, such as the World Economic Forum (2013) and the International Transport Forum (2018). When operationalising resilience concepts, it is important to critically discuss "resilience of what, to what, for whom and over what time frame" (Helfgott, 2018).In response, supply chain resilience planning seeks to minimize the overall disruption impacts by achieving a balance of robustness, redundancy and recovery capabilities (Ponomarov and Holcomb, 2009;Tukamuhabwa et al., 2015;Kamalahmadi and Mellat Parast, 2016).

        <p>Recent examples of major supply chain disruptions are presented in Table 1, which also illustrates how their impacts can be exacerbated by interdependencies between different systems. Such interdependencies can give rise to cascading failure, as observed, for example, in the chain of events that was triggered by a lightning strike in New Mexico, USA, in the year 2000.Recent examples of major supply chain disruptions are presented in Table 1, which also illustrates how their impacts can be exacerbated by interdependencies between different systems.

        <p>Without power supply, the ventilation system was disrupted and smoke contaminated the facility's clean rooms. The factory was a supplier to Ericsson (the mobile phone producer), for which the disrupted supply of radio frequency chips resulted in USD 200m costs of business interruption (Norrman and Jansson, 2004).Without power supply, the ventilation system was disrupted and smoke contaminated the facility's clean rooms.

        <p>The 2011 Thailand flooding event illustrates that the geographic concentration of important supply chain capacities is a risk factor because spatial proximity means shared hazard exposure and correlated asset failure probabilities. The flooding affected more than 800 factories, among them some of the world's largest producers of hard disk drives. Their production output decreased by 30 %, resulting in price increases of 80 to 190 % affecting the entire global IT value chain (Haraguchi and Lall, 2015).The 2011 Thailand flooding event illustrates that the geographic concentration of important supply chain capacities is a risk factor because spatial proximity means shared hazard exposure and correlated asset failure probabilities.

        <p>Functional dependencies occur if one process requires an output from another, with the consequence of inadequate operation if the supply of the required product or service is disrupted. For example, the 2011 Japan earthquake caused a two-week shutdown of all Toyota factories, even though most escaped damage. However, just-in-time production planning meant that they were immediately affected by disruptions in the supply of parts from other factories (Matsuo, 2015).Functional dependencies occur if one process requires an output from another, with the consequence of inadequate operation if the supply of the required product or service is disrupted.

        <p>Functional dependencies can also delay recovery processes. This was observed, for example, after hurricane Sandy when the liquid fuel supply chain in New York City was disrupted due to flood damage to terminals, refineries and pipelines. Recovery required electric power supply to operate pumps and other equipment, and was, therefore, dependent on the restoration of the electric power network or provision of back-up power supply (The City of New York, 2013).Functional dependencies can also delay recovery processes.

        <p>Empirical research by Ambulkar et al. (2015) and de Sá et al.

        <p>Different modelling approaches have been developed in this field, using methods such as network theory (Geunes and Pardalos, 2003), system dynamics (Wilson, 2007), input-output modelling (Pant et al., 2011), agentbased simulation (Hou et al., 2018), queuing models (Gillen and Hasheminia, 2016), quality function deployment (Lam and Bai, 2016), cellular automata (Chen et al., 2015), game theory (Nagurney et al., 2016) and control theory (Ivanov and Sokolov, 2019). Such methods have been used to analyse pre-disruption mitigation decisions (e.g. supply chain network design, capacity investments) and post-disruption operational decisions (e.g. re-routing, adjustment of production). However, relatively few publications consider optimal recovery strategies, which entail planning the repair of damaged assets and the logistics of providing repair resources.Different modelling approaches have been developed in this field, using methods such as network theory (Geunes and Pardalos, 2003), system dynamics (Wilson, 2007), input-output modelling (Pant et al., 2011), agentbased simulation (Hou et al., 2018), queuing models (Gillen and Hasheminia, 2016), quality function deployment (Lam and Bai, 2016), cellular automata (Chen et al., 2015), game theory (Nagurney et al., 2016) and control theory (Ivanov and Sokolov, 2019).

        <p>A comprehensive review of quantitative supply chain resilience models is provided by Hosseini et al. (2019).

        <p>The literature on supply chain planning addresses uncertainties of demand, capacity and costs (e.g. Santoso et al., 2005;Azaron et al., 2008;Mohammadi Bidhandi and Mohd Yusuff, 2011). These uncertainties are usually represented by a set of discrete scenarios. Two-stage models assume that the value of all uncertain parameters is revealed at the same time.The literature on supply chain planning addresses uncertainties of demand, capacity and costs (e.g. Santoso et al., 2005;Azaron et al., 2008;Mohammadi Bidhandi and Mohd Yusuff, 2011).

        <p>Multi-stage models, on the other hand, consider multiple points in time at which the value of uncertain parameters becomes known and recourse decisions can be taken.Multi-stage models, on the other hand, consider multiple points in time at which the value of uncertain parameters becomes known and recourse decisions can be taken.</p>
        <p>Interdependency entails that the probability distribution of parameters for one part of the supply chain may be dependent on the value of uncertain parameters for other parts. This can lead to instances of cascading failure or ripple effects (Dolgui et al., 2018). Masih-Tehrani et al. (2011) andLi et al. (2013) analyse such interdependencies arising from the correlation of capacity losses in different facilities. Rezapour et al. (2015) model the propagation of supply-and demand-side uncertainties, providing a method for calculating optimal service levels. A dynamic model with correlated disruptions is presented in Hasani and Khosrojerdi (2016).Interdependency entails that the probability distribution of parameters for one part of the supply chain may be dependent on the value of uncertain parameters for other parts.

        <p>However, the above-mentioned models do not address the issue of supply chain recovery. In Goldbeck et al. (2017), interconnected Markov chains were used to model failure as well as repair of supply chain assets, but this model treats recovery as a random process and does not consider the optimal scheduling of repair works and allocation of repair resources.However, the above-mentioned models do not address the issue of supply chain recovery.

        <p>Chen et al. ( 2017) and Zhalechian et al. (2018) also consider the problem of where to prioritize repair, given constraints such as an overall repair budget. This is important because the balance of asset protection and contingency planning is a key resilience aspect. However, these papers do not model the efficient management of repair resources, for example, staff, equipment, spare parts, which is a problem of great practical relevance for a quick recovery.Chen et al.

Such models are computationally difficult to solve and therefore of limited scalability, especially when they contain integer decision variables and non-linear equations. Furthermore, they do not consider repair. Nurre et al.

Glockner and Nemhauser (2000) show that dynamic flows under uncertain network capacity can also be modelled using linear multi-stage stochastic programming models, which are easier to solve. We follow this approach in order to develop a model that can be used to analyse simulation periods with more than 100 time steps and 100 scenarios. This could not be achieved with integer programming approaches due to computational limitations.Dynamic models with more than two time steps are presented, for example, by Hasani and Khosrojerdi (2016), Parajuli et al.

        <p>The repair nodes are connected to the associated node or link in the supply chain network via functional dependencies. In the absence of further information on the types of assets and repair resources, it is sensible to assume that the amount of repair resources required is related to the capital value of the asset. Therefore, we set the input dependency coefficients α f i,j,k , multiplied with a markup of 10 % to take into account that the cost for emergency capacity restoration is likely to be higher compared to planned procurement.The repair nodes are connected to the associated node or link in the supply chain network via functional dependencies.

        <p>For the case of individual repair resources, Figure 5 shows the supply chain performance, measured as the total value of products supplied divided by the total value of products demanded, as described in Section 3.6. Using Equation ( 2), the RLT metric was found to be 2.36, which corresponds to the shaded area between the expected and full performance curves in Figure 5. In other words, the model estimates that the expected impact of the assumed hazard is equivalent to a complete disruption of the supply chain for 2.36 days. and shared repair resources. The worst-case RLT value with shared repair resources is 12.94, which is higher than in the case of individual repair resources (11.30). However, the expected RLT decreases from 2.36 to 1.66 and the 95 % percentile decreases from 7.66 to 5.94. Thus, the results suggest that sharing recovery resources leads to a better performance of the supply chain in almost all disruption scenarios, but comes at the cost of slightly worse performance in the most severe disruption scenario.For the case of individual repair resources, Figure 5 shows the supply chain performance, measured as the total value of products supplied divided by the total value of products demanded, as described in Section 3.6.

        <p>Figure 7 shows the optimal capacities calculated for all three cases. Optimal capacities for production nodes and transport links to the demand nodes are almost the same in all three cases. However, there are substantial differences in optimal storage capacities. expected, the optimal supply chain configuration in the no-hazard case is a just-in-time operation, which eliminates the need for storage. In the two other cases, storage is needed at the import and supplier nodes.Figure 7 shows the optimal capacities calculated for all three cases.

        <p>Optimal storage capacity is unevenly distributed among the five suppli-ers, with a particularly high value for node Out S3 (284 and 64 commodity units with individual and shared repair resources respectively). This can be explained by differences in the average volume of parts needed from these suppliers and by the difference in their value. To satisfy the entire demand, 299 parts from S2 and S3 are needed, compared to only 126 from S1. Furthermore, parts supplied by S3 have a lower value than all other parts, which translates into lower costs for storage capacity and inventory holding. Considering that the damage risk is the same for the facilities of all suppliers, it is plausible to invest in storage for those parts that are needed in greater quantities and can be stored at relatively low costs.Optimal storage capacity is unevenly distributed among the five suppli-ers, with a particularly high value for node Out S3 (284 and 64 commodity units with individual and shared repair resources respectively).

        <p>The total storage capacity throughout the supply chain is 54 % lower in the case of shared repair resources compared to the case of individual repair resources.

        <p>Moreover, the total capacity for providing repair resources throughout the supply chain decreases by 63 %. Thus, it has been shown, so far, that the supply chain analysed in this case study is more resilient with overall lower repair capacity if this capacity is shared through a common hub for exchanging repair resources. Finally, we analyse the costs predicted by the simulation model. Figure 9 shows cost differences compared to the no-disruption baseline scenario. The expected total costs are USD 18.3 million higher in the case of individual repair resources, and USD 15.1 million higher in the case of shared repair resources, compared to the no-disruption case.Moreover, the total capacity for providing repair resources throughout the supply chain decreases by 63 %.

        <p>The main driver for the cost increase is in both cases operational expenditure for asset repair. The main sources of the USD 3.2 million cost savings in the case of shared repair resources are lower investments in repair capacity as well as lower revenue losses and penalties.The main driver for the cost increase is in both cases operational expenditure for asset repair.

        <p>In summary, we find that sharing repair resources has two effects in our example supply chain: First, the supply chain's ability to mitigate impacts of asset failures improves, which leads to higher reliability of supply for end customers. Secondly, repair resources are used more efficiently, which means that the overall investment in capacity for providing repair resources can be reduced.In summary, we find that sharing repair resources has two effects in our example supply chain: First, the supply chain's ability to mitigate impacts of asset failures improves, which leads to higher reliability of supply for end customers.

        <p>We have presented a case study that demonstrates the application of the proposed method to a real-world supply chain from a benchmarking dataset that provides topology, demand, cost and process duration parameters. The cost breakdown into capital and operational expenditure, as well as penalty costs for unmet demand, are parameter assumptions that could easily be replaced by an analyst with access to business sensitive data.We have presented a case study that demonstrates the application of the proposed method to a real-world supply chain from a benchmarking dataset that provides topology, demand, cost and process duration parameters.

        <p>Parameter assumptions regarding the risk of initial damage and failure propagation could not be verified with the information provided by the generic benchmarking dataset. Considering that the method is geared towards analysing extreme event scenarios with little or no historical precedence, it is expected that the required parameters will be set based on subject matter expertise rather than statistical analysis of previous incidents. Extensive sensitivity analysis should be carried out before making decisions based on the simulation results.Parameter assumptions regarding the risk of initial damage and failure propagation could not be verified with the information provided by the generic benchmarking dataset.

        <p>In comparison with state-of-the-art supply chain models, we find that the method proposed in this paper provides additional insights that are useful for improving supply chain resilience. For instance, Chen et al. (2017) and Zhalechian et al. (2018) also provide a method for calculating optimal priorities for recovery tasks but these models include repair budgets as exogenous parameters. In contrast, the method proposed in this paper calculates the optimal repair capability based on savings from avoided disruptions of supply to end customers.In comparison with state-of-the-art supply chain models, we find that the method proposed in this paper provides additional insights that are useful for improving supply chain resilience.

        <p>Another difference to the previous research by Chen et al. (2017) and Zhalechian et al.

Similar dynamic models for analysing supply chain planning have been pub-lished previously (e.g. Hasani and Khosrojerdi, 2016;Parajuli et al., 2017;Ghavamifar et al., 2018), but did not address the problem of optimising repair strategies. In the case study presented above, sequential decisions over 260 time steps were analysed. The dynamics of system performance degradation and recovery are very different across the 100 scenarios analysed, highlighting the importance of a higher temporal resolution.Another difference to the previous research by Chen et al.

        <p>The scenario generation method used in this paper considers the risk of failure propagation, similar to previous research on correlated failure probabilities in supply chains (e.g. Masih-Tehrani et al., 2011;Li et al., 2013;Rezapour et al., 2015;Hasani and Khosrojerdi, 2016).

        <p>It is worth noting that the multi-stage stochastic programming model used in this paper is based on the assumption that decisions are taken based on knowledge of the full scenario tree, i.e. that all possible asset failure scenarios and their probabilities are known to the decision makers. Therefore, the realism of the model depends on two factors: First, supply chain managers are assumed to have the same information that is used to gen-erate the scenario tree. This would usually be the case when applying the model because the scenario tree generation method relies on subject matter expertise to estimate failure and failure propagation probabilities.It is worth noting that the multi-stage stochastic programming model used in this paper is based on the assumption that decisions are taken based on knowledge of the full scenario tree, i.e. that all possible asset failure scenarios and their probabilities are known to the decision makers.

        <p>Second, the scenario tree should fully capture the uncertainty of asset failure. This can be difficult to achieve if the number of assets at risk is large. In this regard, it is an important advantage that the proposed model avoids integer variables can, therefore, be solved for larger scenario trees compared to computationally more costly mixed-integer models.Second, the scenario tree should fully capture the uncertainty of asset failure.

        <p>A limitation of the model presented in this paper is that distributed decision making of different stakeholders is not considered. For this reason, the proposed methodology is most suitable for the analysis of supply chains that are sufficiently integrated, such that all stakeholders have a mutual interest and ability to share information and collaborate in order to achieve system-optimal supply chain recovery.A limitation of the model presented in this paper is that distributed decision making of different stakeholders is not considered.

        <p>Finally, we note that the proposed model is capable of considering nonlinear cost functions, such as additional penalties if the supply falls below a certain service level threshold. Moreover, the model captures economies of scale, as it distinguishes between capital and operational expenditure, and seeks to optimize capacity utilisation. However, modelling economies of scale resulting from increasing marginal returns from resource inputs for production or repair processes would lead to a non-convex optimization problem, which is substantially more difficult to solve.Finally, we note that the proposed model is capable of considering nonlinear cost functions, such as additional penalties if the supply falls below a certain service level threshold.

        <p>In future research, the methodological framework presented in this paper can be extended to consider different failure modes, use arbitrarily sized simulation time steps, and distinguish between consumable and non-consumable repair resources. Another promising direction would be to continue the investigation of interdependencies between supply chains and infrastructure systems. In particular, the dependency of supply chain and repair resource logistics on transport and energy systems, as well as the dependence of critical infrastructure on supply chains providing repair resources, are yet to be analysed in detail using dynamic and stochastic modelling methods. Such studies are likely to uncover non-linear relationships and may have to solve computationally challenging optimization problems or resort to heuristic or approximation methods.In future research, the methodological framework presented in this paper can be extended to consider different failure modes, use arbitrarily sized simulation time steps, and distinguish between consumable and non-consumable repair resources.
