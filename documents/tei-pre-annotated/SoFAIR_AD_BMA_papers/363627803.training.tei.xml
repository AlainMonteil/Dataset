        <p>Medical tourism (MT) is an increasingly valuable component of many national service economies (Connell, 2013). Across both developed and developing contexts, medical care has been successfully packaged and marketed towards cross-border consumers (Connell, 2006;Han, 2013). The scope of such MT activity is broad and inclusive; services offered range from bariatric care and fertility treatment to a range of cosmetic and non-essential procedures. The driving factors behind medical tourists seeking overseas treatment are varied, and encompass quality (Lu, Wu, &amp; Chen, 2016), value (Wang, 2012), speed of access to care and even tourism involvement relating to the destination of the medical facility (Crooks et al., 2011). The overall MT sector is significant and growing, with predictions that by 2027 it will reach USD 207.9 billion (Market Analysis Report, 2020).Medical tourism (MT) is an increasingly valuable component of many national service economies (Connell, 2013).

        <p>While the research field examining health and medical tourism has expanded considerably (Connell, 2013), theoretical understanding of economic and marketing issues are recognised as topics requiring further scholarly attention (Chuang, Liu, Lu, &amp; Lee, 2014). One marketing aspect of MT that remains notably underexplored relates to the recruitment of patients. To date, only a limited body of research has examined the configurations of marketing channels and business development practices utilised by medical providers to participate in competitively intensifying global marketplaces (Abubakar &amp; Ilkan, 2016;Yeoh, Othman, &amp; Ahmad, 2013).While the research field examining health and medical tourism has expanded considerably (Connell, 2013), theoretical understanding of economic and marketing issues are recognised as topics requiring further scholarly attention (Chuang, Liu, Lu, &amp; Lee, 2014).

        <p>Prior research has found that an individual patient's intention to choose a particular medical service provider is related to the service and destination offer (Connell, 2006;Heung, Kucukusta, &amp; Song, 2011;Moghimehfar &amp; Nasr-Esfahani, 2011;Smith &amp; Forgione, 2007).Prior research has found that an individual patient's intention to choose a particular medical service provider is related to the service and destination offer (Connell, 2006;Heung, Kucukusta, &amp; Song, 2011;Moghimehfar &amp; Nasr-Esfahani, 2011;Smith &amp; Forgione, 2007).</p>
        <p>Other research has focused on the importance of 'perceived value' on an individual's postoperative evaluations of their experience. This is shown to predict individuals favourable/unfavourable intentions to refer that experience to others and provides an insight into the benefits MT consumers derive from the service (Han &amp; Hwang, 2013;Han &amp; Hyun, 2015;Lee, 2010). While this research offers valuable insight into MT, it has not yet offered an integrated analysis of MT decision-making and patient recruitment, nor has it advanced a MT provider perspective on how value is created by those interacting with patients at MT hospitals.Other research has focused on the importance of 'perceived value' on an individual's postoperative evaluations of their experience.

        <p>This paper extends existing research by developing two complementary studies that seek to theorise the drivers of WoM in a MT context. In study one, we examine value creation through service delivery in MT facilities. Owing to the underexplored nature of value creation (O'Cass &amp; Sok, 2015;Taheri, Coelho, Sousa, &amp; Evanschitzky, 2017) in this context, we utilise an inductive approach to explore ways in which MT staff (both clinical and non-clinical) navigate organisational tensions to provide a positive experience for patients (which will influence likelihood of a WoM referral). Study two examines how patients perceive value following their treatment and tourism experience. We link the outcomes of this evaluation to the likelihood of them providing a WoM recommendation for the MT facility. Then, in our discussion, we integrate the findings of study one and two to emphasise the role of service delivery on WoM. Our research questions are thus: To address these questions, we conduct a two-stage mixed-methods study based at a leading private hospital in north-west Iran. We draw on in-depth qualitative interview data from 61 medical and support staff (study 1) and survey data from 785 medical tourism patients (study 2). We find support for country environment, tourism destination, medical tourism costs/facilities and services as important in the perceived value of MT choices, and ultimately, the likelihood of referring this service to others. We explore for the first time both the MT patient and those involved in service delivery at the MT destination. The analysis highlights novel findings relating to role tensions within MT facilities and threats to medical professional identities, that can manifest in the overall service experience of patients. Finally, we raise some practical implications for MT providers by considering the significance of balancing destination involvement with medical care provision and the likelihood of WoM referrals as competition intensifies within the sector.This paper extends existing research by developing two complementary studies that seek to theorise the drivers of WoM in a MT context.

        <p>There are a number of definitions of the term 'medical tourism' in the literature, but nearly all centre around the notion of travel, usually abroad, with the dual intentions of seeking medical care and holiday-making (Table 1). Most research has focused on the motivations of those undertaking medical tourism, the 'medical tourists' (see Connell, 2006;Heung et al., 2010;Ghosh &amp; Mandal, 2019;Mathijsen, 2019;Yu &amp; Ko, 2012 amongst others). Key drivers for this type of activity can be broadly grouped into factors related to cost, accessibility, and broader factors related to the tourism pull of the country of destination. Research has also examined the motivations of medical healthcare providers and the wider tourism industry in promoting medical tourism (Goodrich &amp; Goodrich, 1987). Mathijsen (2019, p. 374), for example, categorises a range of factors for medical tourists travelling aboard for a treatment, including:There are a number of definitions of the term 'medical tourism' in the literature, but nearly all centre around the notion of travel, usually abroad, with the dual intentions of seeking medical care and holiday-making (Table 1).

        <p>"…the relative price of domestic treatment (broadly defined as 'cost saving'); the relative waiting time of the domestic treatment ('long waiting lists'); quality of healthcare; diversity of facilities and choice; inadequate or non-existent insurance; ability to maintain anonymity and maintain privacy; cultural affinity in terms of language, norms, religion, food; access to the latest technologies and treatments; unavailable ('circumvention tourism') or unaffordable procedures in their own countries; distrust and unfamiliarity with healthcare systems of receiving country; [and the] added benefit of a holiday." Yu and Ko (2012, p. 82) suggest "medical tourism is conceptually full of nuances, contradictions and contrasts," leading to a lack of construct clarity (Crompton, 1992;Fetscherin &amp; Stephano, 2016;Ghosh &amp; Mandal, 2019;Mathijsen, 2019). Some scholars emphasise the medical aspect of MT, suggesting that we should refer to medical examinations that take place abroad rather than medical 'tourism' (Connell, 2013;Ghosh &amp; Mandal, 2019;Johnston, Crooks, &amp; Snyder, 2012;Mathijsen, 2019;Nahai, 2009;Uchida, 2015). In doing so, they argue that "those who travel internationally are patients, not tourists for shopping and a pleasurable holiday" (Uchida, 2015, p. 19). Others, argue that tourism factors are in fact a key component of the MT destination choice, though note the balance of decision making will vary from individual to individual, and will be influenced by the type of medical procedure they are choosing to undergo (Cohen, 2008;Fetscherin &amp; Stephano, 2016;Lovelock &amp; Lovelock, 2018;Wongkit &amp; McKercher, 2013)."…the relative price of domestic treatment (broadly defined as 'cost saving'); the relative waiting time of the domestic treatment ('long waiting lists'); quality of healthcare; diversity of facilities and choice; inadequate or non-existent insurance; ability to maintain anonymity and maintain privacy; cultural affinity in terms of language, norms, religion, food; access to the latest technologies and treatments; unavailable ('circumvention tourism') or unaffordable procedures in their own countries; distrust and unfamiliarity with healthcare systems of receiving country; [and the] added benefit of a holiday."

        <p>While MT research has confirmed that WoM influences customer acquisition and retention (Han &amp; Hyun, 2015;Yeoh et al., 2013), there is no detailed understanding of what drives a referral in the MT context. Empirical evidence suggests that MT consumers are largely influenced by a WoM recommendation from friends and family (e.g., Musa, Thirumoorthi &amp; Doshi, 2012), with the internet being only a secondary influencer (e.g., Chuang et al., 2014;Connell, 2013). Connell (2013) argues that, as MT develops, WoM is becoming more important, with online channels serving largely functional roles in the checking of facts and booking treatment packages.While MT research has confirmed that WoM influences customer acquisition and retention (Han &amp; Hyun, 2015;Yeoh et al., 2013), there is no detailed understanding of what drives a referral in the MT context.

        <p>WoM is a well-established concept in marketing literature, with significant theoretical development that draws upon cognitive, emotional and interactionist perspectives (Berger, 2014;Gannon, Taheri, &amp; Olya, 2019;De Matos &amp; Rossi, 2008). The most widely accepted definition of WoM is as "informal communications directed at other consumers about the ownership, usage, or characteristics of particular goods and services and/or their sellers" (Westbrook, 1987, p. 261). WoM is influential in-service sectors such as medical tourism, owing to the intangible and experiential nature of product offerings (Zeithaml, Berry, &amp; Parasuraman, 1993). Empirical evidence has shown that WoM referrals provide a means of reducing the risk inherent to such transactions (Musa et al., 2012).WoM is a well-established concept in marketing literature, with significant theoretical development that draws upon cognitive, emotional and interactionist perspectives (Berger, 2014;Gannon, Taheri, &amp; Olya, 2019;De Matos &amp; Rossi, 2008).

        <p>We developed the conceptual framework shown in Fig. 1 based on a review of the WoM literature, relating this specifically to the MT context. Drawing on MT literature we argue that the intention of patients to refer a MT provider to others through WoM referrals, is related to their perceptions of value following a treatment, based on both service experience and expectations of that experience prior to treatment. In a MT context, we propose that this perception of value is derived from both factors related to the service quality provision and overall tourism experience. We also propose that these factors in themselves may have a direct effect on the likelihood of WoM referrals. The theoretical rationale for the relationships proposed in the conceptual model is discussed in following sections.We developed the conceptual framework shown in Fig. 1 based on a review of the WoM literature, relating this specifically to the MT context.

        <p>Supporting service quality Marketing literature highlights the important role of perceived value in a patient's intention to refer a service to others through WoM (Sanchez-Fernandez &amp; Iniesta-Bonillo, 2007;Sweeney &amp; Soutar, 2001;Zeithaml, 1988). Perceived value can be defined as the "consumer's overall assessment of the utility of a product (or service) based on perceptions of what is received and what is given" (Zeithaml, 1988, p. 14). It is based on a trade-off between the quality, or benefits, customers receive from a service, and a customers' sacrifices to obtain such quality/benefits (Monroe, 1990;Oh, 2000;Yang &amp; Peterson, 2004;Zeithaml, 1988).Supporting service quality Marketing literature highlights the important role of perceived value in a patient's intention to refer a service to others through WoM (Sanchez-Fernandez &amp; Iniesta-Bonillo, 2007;Sweeney &amp; Soutar, 2001;Zeithaml, 1988).

It is based on a trade-off between the quality, or benefits, customers receive from a service, and a customers' sacrifices to obtain such quality/benefits (Monroe, 1990;Oh, 2000;Yang &amp; Peterson, 2004;Zeithaml, 1988).</p>
        <p>Within the tourism literature it has been identified as a key component in the choice of one destination over another (Han &amp; Hyuan, 2012;Lee, 2010). However, there has been limited empirical research on the importance of perceived value on behavioural intention within the medical tourism literature. In one of the few studies examining the impact of perceived value on medical tourism choice, Han and Hwang (2013) found that perceived value was significantly related to the perceived benefits of a medical hotel and that perceived value positively affected behavioural intentions. In particular, they found that increases in financial savings, convenience and medical service lead to an increase in tourist's perceptions of high perceived value in the medical tourism hotel. This meant that medical tourists would be willing to visit, and critically, would recommend it to others.Within the tourism literature it has been identified as a key component in the choice of one destination over another (Han &amp; Hyuan, 2012;Lee, 2010).

        <p>Drawing on wider service literature (Gannon et al., 2019;Zeithaml, 1988;Zeithaml et al., 1993), we propose that perceptions of medical service quality will have a direct effect on WoM, and it will have an indirect effect through perceptions of value. Here, service quality can be defined as "the outcome of a process in which consumers' expectations for the service are compared with their perceptions of the service actually delivered" (Mangold &amp; Babakus, 1991, p. 60). Thus, perceptions of quality are implicitly related to expectations (Zeithaml et al., 1993). There has been less focus on medical service providers than consumers within the medical tourism field, but most who have explored this area have adapted the well-known SERVQUAL scale to evaluate service standards in medical tourism (Debata et al., 2015;Guiry &amp; Vequist, 2011;Manaf et al., 2015;Wang, 2012). This scale identifies five key quality dimensions related to the physical facilities of the service provider: the reliability and dependability of the service; the responsiveness of the service provision and willingness to help customers; assurance of employees in terms of knowledge and courtesy; empathy in terms of care provision; and finally, individualised attention (Zeithaml, Bitner, &amp; Gremler, 2009;Parasuraman, Zeithaml &amp; Berry, 1988;1991).Drawing on wider service literature (Gannon et al., 2019;Zeithaml, 1988;Zeithaml et al., 1993), we propose that perceptions of medical service quality will have a direct effect on WoM, and it will have an indirect effect through perceptions of value.

        <p>We propose that the tourism experience will have a direct effect on WoM referrals and an indirect effect again through perceived value. As discussed above, tourism factors are a key part of the cognitive decision-making process for medical tourists (Cohen, 2008;Fetscherin &amp; Stephano, 2016;Lovelock &amp; Lovelock, 2018;Wongkit &amp; McKercher, 2013). The overall image of a country has been shown to be a key factor in choice as a tourist destination, and this factor applies to the MT context as well (Beerli &amp; Martin, 2004;Gallarza, Saura, &amp; Garcı á, 2002). The importance of tourism-specific factors has been highlighted by other research in this area, with scholars noting cultural and natural attractions, weather and attractiveness, popularity, and exoticness as a tourist destination as important dimensions (Fetscherin &amp; Stephano, 2016;Lovelock &amp; Lovelock, 2018). Tourism "involvement is … described as the state of motivation and desire towards an activity or an associated item" (Lu et al., 2015, p. 88). Involvement has been measured as both a unidimensional and multidimensional concept and opinions on the preferred number of dimensions remain mixed. However, studies concur that personal interest is an important factor, and all current conceptualisation includes this dimension (Gursoy &amp; Gavcar, 2003;Lee &amp; Beeler, 2009;Lu et al., 2015). Numerous studies have highlighted the importance of tourism involvement in tourist's evaluations of their activities and their future behavioural intentions (Funk, Ridinger, &amp; Moorman, 2004;Gursoy &amp; Gavcar, 2003;Lu et al., 2015;Hwang, Lee, &amp; Chen, 2005;Lee &amp; Beeler, 2009). Several studies have found involvement to be a significant predictor of satisfaction and future intention (Kim, Kim, &amp; Kim, 2009;Lee &amp; Beeler, 2009).We propose that the tourism experience will have a direct effect on WoM referrals and an indirect effect again through perceived value.

        <p>The literature on destination distinctiveness draws on place branding, destination marketing and tourism destination image (Beerli &amp; Martin, 2004;Gallarza et al., 2002;Pike &amp; Page, 2014;Viladrich &amp; Baron-Faust, 2014). Tourism destination image is a set of beliefs, ideas and impressions generated by tourists (Crompton, 1979), and can be defined as "all that the destination evokes in the individual; any idea, belief, feeling or attitude that tourists associate with the place" (Alcañiz, García, &amp; Blas, 2009, p. 716). It has been shown to influence the cognitive evaluation and subsequent decision-making in relation to destination choice (Lu et al., 2015). It has both cognitive and affective components comprising the tangible properties of a destination and prospective tourists' feelings and evaluations towards that destination (Pike &amp; Ryan, 2004;Wang &amp; Hsu, 2010).The literature on destination distinctiveness draws on place branding, destination marketing and tourism destination image (Beerli &amp; Martin, 2004;Gallarza et al., 2002;Pike &amp; Page, 2014;Viladrich &amp; Baron-Faust, 2014).

        <p>The branding of a destination as distinctive, is a way of communicating a uniqueness that sets it apart from its competitors (Pike &amp; Page, 2014;Qu, Kim, &amp; Im, 2011). The perception of this distinctiveness by tourists gives a location a competitive advantage that is notionally difficult for others to replicate. In turn this will increase its attractiveness vis-a-vis other locations and has been shown to lead to positive intentions to both purchase (Currás-Pérez, Bigné- Alcañiz, &amp; Alvarado-Herrera, 2009) and to refer to others (Qu et al., 2011).The branding of a destination as distinctive, is a way of communicating a uniqueness that sets it apart from its competitors (Pike &amp; Page, 2014;Qu, Kim, &amp; Im, 2011).

        <p>Finally, we suggest that the expectations around the attractiveness of a country as a MT destination will influence tourism experience and service quality during the actual service encounter. This in turn will affect perceived value and WoM. These expectations will also have a direct effect on perceptions of MT perceived value. These expectations consist of factors related to both the medical and tourism experience, and the overall environment and image of the MT destination country. Prior research has argued that an individual patient's intention to choose a particular medical service provider is related to three key factors: the overall environment of the particular country of choice; that country's healthcare and wider tourism industries; and, the specific quality of the medical facility and associated services (Connell, 2006;Heung, Kucukusta, &amp; Song, 2011;Moghimehfar &amp; Nasr-Esfahani, 2011;Smith &amp; Forgione, 2007). Most recently, these factors have been successfully conceptualised as the Medical Tourism Index (MTI) (Fetscherin &amp; Stephano, 2016). The overall image of a country has been shown to be a key factor in choice as a tourist destination and this factor also relates to choose for MT (Beerli &amp; Martin, 2004;Gallarza, Saura, &amp; Garcı á, 2002). In addition to image, other key country-related factors include the political and economic environment (Connell, 2006;Smith, Álvarez, &amp; Chanda, 2011;Yu &amp; Ko, 2012) and; cultural similarity and cultural distance (Lee &amp; Davis, 2005;Yu &amp; Ko, 2012). The importance of tourism specific factors has been highlighted by other research, such as: cultural and natural attractions; weather and attractiveness; popularity and; exoticness as a tourist destination (Fetscherin &amp; Stephano, 2016;Lovelock &amp; Lovelock, 2018).Finally, we suggest that the expectations around the attractiveness of a country as a MT destination will influence tourism experience and service quality during the actual service encounter.

        <p>The rapid development of MT and the concomitant access to advanced medical technology has meant that the medical infrastructure and systems used by private hospitals has developed rapidly and healthcare costs reduced. The relatively lower costs of accessing medical treatment abroad has been found to be a key driver of medical tourism (Connell, 2006;Smith &amp; Forgione, 2007;Yu &amp; Ko, 2012). The quality of medical facilities and services have also been shown to be key factors in the decision to choose particular medical service providers (Abd Manaf et al., 2017;Fetscherin &amp; Stephano, 2016;Heung et al., 2011;Moghavvemi et al., 2017;Smith &amp; Forgione, 2007). Some elements are related to the quality of the actual facility in terms of reputation, accreditation and medical equipment (Connell, 2006;Heung, Kucukusta, &amp; Song, 2011;Moghavvemi et al., 2017;Smith &amp; Forgione, 2007;Yu &amp; Ko, 2012). Others relate to the quality of care given by medical staff and their medical reputation (Berkowitz &amp; Flexner, 1980;Heung et al., 2011;Manaf et al., 2017;Mattoo &amp; Rathindran, 2006).The rapid development of MT and the concomitant access to advanced medical technology has meant that the medical infrastructure and systems used by private hospitals has developed rapidly and healthcare costs reduced.

        <p>To answer our research questions, we adopted a two-stage explanatory design approach combining quantitative and qualitative data (Alexander, MacLaren, O'Gorman, &amp; Taheri, 2012;Creswell &amp; Creswell, 2018;Teddlie &amp; Tashakkori, 2009). The combination of quantitative and qualitative methods offers more insightful and more complex answers to research questions compared to either of them alone; it further provides a platform for integrating quantitative accuracy with narrative complexity (Creswell &amp; Creswell, 2018;Teddlie &amp; Tashakkori, 2009). For our first study, a series of semi-structured interviews were conducted with medical and support staff at a leading private hospital in north-west Iran. The objective of this study was to examine the complex nature of value creation (O'Cass &amp; Sok, 2015;Taheri et al., 2017) through ongoing service delivery by clinical and non-clinical employees. This was followed by a second study, which was operationalised through a survey of in-patients at the same hospital, exploring their reasons for choosing this service provider and their experiences whilst there.To answer our research questions, we adopted a two-stage explanatory design approach combining quantitative and qualitative data (Alexander, MacLaren, O'Gorman, &amp; Taheri, 2012;Creswell &amp; Creswell, 2018;Teddlie &amp; Tashakkori, 2009).

        <p>The Iranian health system has been subject to various reforms over the past three purposive and snowball sampling (Ritchie, Lewis, &amp; Elam, 2003;Wells, Gregory-Smith, Taheri, Manika, &amp; McCowlen, 2016a). Purposive sampling facilitated the identification of appropriate participants for the study, while snowball sampling allowed selected individuals to identify others that they knew to be information-rich as the research progressed (Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985). Our intention was to gather a representative range of respondents that broadly reflected the various jobs families within the hospital (e.g., clinical, management, administrative, tourism-related, marketing and service/maintenance/cleaning). Our final sample achieved a good balance, albeit it was skewed slightly towards clinical respondents, largely owing to their more detailed knowledge of MT, and their willingness to discuss matters candidly and on-the-record.The Iranian health system has been subject to various reforms over the past three purposive and snowball sampling (Ritchie, Lewis, &amp; Elam, 2003;Wells, Gregory-Smith, Taheri, Manika, &amp; McCowlen, 2016a).

        <p>All interviews were undertaken by a native speaker (of both Farsi and English languages), a member of the research team. The interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim, and confidentiality of participants was assured. In order to maintain the anonymity of participants and the organisation, identifying details have been modified and pseudonyms are used throughout this research. The interviews were semi-structured and alternated between short intercept-style interviews to longer in-depth interviews. The first five individual interviews took the form of open-ended 'chats', as we aimed to construct a bigger picture of the hospital employees' view on their daily work and interactions with one another (Hudson &amp; Ozanne, 1988;Jafari, Taheri, &amp; vom Lehn, 2013). We then added further questions to subsequent participant interviews based on our literature review findings, specifically around those themes relating to service quality, service delivery, destination distinction and tourism involvement. We encouraged further insights by asking open questions around the more general experiences of working in a MT facility. From these open questions we discovered tensions between commercial (i.e. revenue-generating) and care-giving provision, and accordingly we incorporated this theme in to ensuing interviews with respondents. Our participants were encouraged to illuminate their views with specific workplace examples, stories and personal narratives (Jafari et al., 2013). We followed the approach developed by Gioia, Corley and Hamilton (2013) transcriptions amounting to over 1,000 double-spaced pages. Furthermore, field notes and 417 memos were taken during and after the interviews and were triangulated with the audio to 418 strengthen the validity and credibility of the research (Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994). After this initial step, we manually coded our data and identified empirical themes. We categorised a series of 'first order' codes that reflected broad activities relating to the creation and delivery of patient value, where key words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs from the transcripts, memos, field notes and secondary data were underpinned by our emerging analysis (Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994).All interviews were undertaken by a native speaker (of both Farsi and English languages), a member of the research team.

        <p>A survey was then conducted with international medical travellers who had visited Iran for medical attention within 6 months in 2016. The questionnaires were distributed to international patients receiving medical care in the private hospital in the last day of their visit within the hospital (on site in order to safeguard high response and usability rates). We designed the questionnaire and provided exact instructions on how data collection should be undertaken. Patients were approached directly to improve the validity of our study. Using nonprobability judgmental sampling, we only conducted our questionnaire from those travellers who had previous international medical-tourism experience. As Wells et al.

The questionnaires were distributed to international patients receiving medical care in the private hospital in the last day of their visit within the hospital (on site in order to safeguard high response and usability rates). We designed the questionnaire and provided exact instructions on how data collection should be undertaken. Patients were approached directly to improve the validity of our study.

We prepared several different versions of the questionnaire (English, Azeri, Russian and Arabic), since the majority of the international patients could communicate in one of these languages. We used a back-translation method in order to gain a higher level of consistency and accuracy (Wells et al., 2016b)."this sampling technique has been noted as an effective way of collecting data where the aim is theoretical advancement rather than generalisation and is used frequently in tourism and hospitality studies".

Garson (2016) also suggests missing values significantly impact structural models when more than 5% of values are missing. Thus, missing values do not have a significant impact in this study. Full details of items, mean values, and standard deviations (SD) under respective constructs are provided in Table 2. The values of Skewness and Kurtosis for some scale items did not fall within the acceptable range (±3), indicating non-normal data distribution (Wells et al., 2016b).Out incomplete data.

        <p>Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used as the method of analysis this study for various reasons. (1) PLS-SEM is desired technique for estimating path coefficients in SEM as it does not require normal distribution (Wells et al., 2016a;do Valle &amp; Assaker, 2015). We tested for multivariate normality examination by calculating zscores for kurtosis and skewness for all items. The findings indicated that some items have the skewness and kurtoses above mandatory cut-off point of -3 and +3 (Hair et al., 2010;Mardia, 1970) (Table 2).Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used as the method of analysis this study for various reasons.

We also used the unmeasured method factor approach suggested by Min, Park and Kim (2016) and Liang et al. (2007) to further examine the CMV. The findings indicate that the average substantively explained variance of the indicators is 0.62, while the average method-based variance is 0.089, yielding a ratio of 69:1.

        <p>Staff highlighted the importance of culture in shaping how patient value was created within the MT facility. In particular, they noted the cultural specificities of working in Iran, which meant that systems developed elsewhere did not necessarily transpose into this particular context, risk-free (Connell, 2013;Momeni et al., 2018;Fetscherin &amp; Stephano, 2016). This was salient, as the internal culture was being driven by need to emulate perceived 'gold standard' practices imported from various Western healthcare systems.Staff highlighted the importance of culture in shaping how patient value was created within the MT facility.

        <p>An aspect of medical tourism that has been overlooked in extant literature is the roletension that employees, particularly on the clinical side, can experience. We found this impacts on value creation as clinical staff can experience additional pressures to meet patient expectations which are often founded on receiving a holistic 'experience'. This causes some tension, as the clinical employees' professional identities are at risk of being eroded as the medical component of MT is subsumed into the larger 'package', causing some medical staff to react assertively by reinforcing their medical credibility and undermining -or even sabotaging -the hedonic aspects of value creation by diminishing it when interacting with patients. This was evident from some medics we spoke with, who stated quite firmly: "I appreciate we want to have more foreign patients in our hospital. But I think doctor should do the doctor job and tour person do his job. I believe the medical service is more important than entertaining them here" (Participant 35).An aspect of medical tourism that has been overlooked in extant literature is the roletension that employees, particularly on the clinical side, can experience.

        <p>This is a phenomenon that is recognisable across other industrial contexts, including social entrepreneurship, in which entrepreneurs experience a tension between mission-derived activities and profit-based activities (Pache &amp; Santos, 2013), and creative industries where artists and managers navigate difficult relations (Bierne, 2012). In the MT context however, we note that there was a division of labour in our case study hospital which compartmentalised the leisure/hedonic aspects of packages and clinical care, leading to potentially inconsistent approaches to value creation/customer experience (O'Cass &amp; Sok, 2015;Taheri et al., 2017).This is a phenomenon that is recognisable across other industrial contexts, including social entrepreneurship, in which entrepreneurs experience a tension between mission-derived activities and profit-based activities (Pache &amp; Santos, 2013), and creative industries where artists and managers navigate difficult relations (Bierne, 2012).

In order to maintain accreditation incentives were developed to encourage compliance. We found that, in the main, staff also showed understanding of the rules and also the importance of transparency of systems and collaboration across departments. Many staff expressed a personal pride in achieving international recognition, and there was a realisation that this was an important means of attracting international patients, which in turn, secures the future and prosperity of the hospital.The importance of quality of provision on tourist's choice of this particular facility and appraisal of the service offered (Fetscherin &amp; Stephano, 2016) was recognised by management and there were clear structures and systems in place to ensure that the level of care was consistently high.

        <p>Thus, the competitiveness of the neighbouring markets had a positive impact on value creation (O'Cass &amp; Sok, 2015;Taheri et al., 2017), as it led to the MT facility investing more in-service delivery as a means of differentiating the value proposition. Furthermore, it caused them to reflect critically on various aspects of practice, and they displayed an openness to removing ineffective processes and replacing them with newer ways of doing things. However, it was noted that competition in the local market had the potential to drive down prices, which again led to a focus on differentiated, higher-value treatments.Thus, the competitiveness of the neighbouring markets had a positive impact on value creation (O'Cass &amp; Sok, 2015;Taheri et al., 2017), as it led to the MT facility investing more in-service delivery as a means of differentiating the value proposition.

        <p>Following Fornell and Larcker (1981) suggestion, the square root of the AVE (diagonal values) of all constructs were larger than all other cross correlations in Table 6.

        <p>If the HTMT value is lower than 0.85, discriminant validity should be documented between constructs. In our study, HTMT values of the first-order constructs surpassed HTMT 0.85 (Table 7) (Henseler et al., 2015). Thus, the reflective constructs have adequate convergent and discriminant validity. (Hair et al., 2017). Four first-order reflective dimensions of MTI had CR, α, AVE values above the required threshold values. Thus, each dimension demonstrated convergent validity. We checked multicollinearity among the indicators (Fetscherin &amp; Stephano, 2016) by calculating the variance inflation factor (VIF) and the tolerance test of multicollinearity. Multi-collinearity was assessed using variance inflation factors (VIF) for the 4 sub-scales comprising the second-order MTI construct and the significance of outer weights (Table 8). The results are acceptable as VIFs for all four comprising the second-order construct are &lt;3 (Hair et al., 2017). The tolerance statistics all well above 0.33 (ranging from 0.427 to 0.751), thus we can safely conclude that there is no collinearity within our data. Furthermore, we tested the external validity by calculating whether each dimension significantly correlated with a 'global item' that recaps the spirit of the MTI (i.e., meta-analytic approach) (Taheri, Jafari, &amp; O'Gorman, 2014;Wanous &amp; Reichers, 1999).If the HTMT value is lower than 0.85, discriminant validity should be documented between constructs.

        <p>In answering these questions, our study makes a number of contributions to MT research. First, our model integrates constructs relating to destination distinction, healthcare provision and the perceived value of the treatment package. From our quantitative study, we found MTI positively influences tourism involvement, destination distinction, medical staff quality, supporting service quality and perceived value, aligning with previous studies by (e.g., Abd Manaf et al., 2015;Gursoy &amp; Gavcar, 2003;Han &amp; Hyuan, 2012;Lee, 2010;Qu et al, 201;Kim &amp; Han, 2008;Prayag &amp; Ryan 2012;Viladrich &amp; Baron-Faust, 2014). Tourism involvement, destination distinction, medical staff quality and supporting service quality positively influence perceived value which further supports previous studies (e.g., Abd Manaf et al., 2015;Kim &amp; Han, 2008;Lee, 2010;Lovelock &amp; Lovelock, 2018;Prayag &amp; Ryan, 2012;Qu et al., 2011). Finally, tourism involvement, destination distinction, medical staff quality, supporting service quality and perceive value positively impact on WoM, supporting previous studies (e.g., Abd Manaf et al., 2015;Fetscherin &amp; Stephano, 2016;Gursoy &amp; Gavcar, 2003;Lu et al., 2015;Prayag &amp; Ryan, 2012;Pike &amp; Ryan, 2004). The results also provide several indirect effects between constructs (Table 9) which we propose require further investigation.In answering these questions, our study makes a number of contributions to MT research.

        <p>Thus, we found that aspects of service experience (around medical treatment) and destination, positively influence perceived value and ultimately result in the intention to recommend and refer the MT provider. We believe the results are robust since we controlled for control variables in our study.Thus, we found that aspects of service experience (around medical treatment) and destination, positively influence perceived value and ultimately result in the intention to recommend and refer the MT provider.

        <p>Medical tourism is a significant economic trend. The market for medical tourism is expanding, and many developing countries are capitalising on both their distinct medical competences and cultural assets to attract foreign visitors to their hospitals. A recent comprehensive analysis of 392 MT articles concluded that scholars should shift attention towards "economic and marketing issues" to advance the research field (Chuang et al., 2014, p. 57). Accordingly, we use the case of a MT hospital in Iran to explore the antecedents of WoM and the perceived value of treatment packages. WoM is critical for MT providers as it has been identified by scholars as the most significant marketing channel for prospective patients (Lee, 2010;Yeoh et al., 2013). We diverge from previous MT studies however, by examining the drivers rather than consequences of WoM (e.g., Abubakar, 2016) and in doing so advance a detailed theoretical model of the cognitive factors influencing WoM referrals.Medical tourism is a significant economic trend.

        <p>Our service-delivery focus offers an important new perspective on the organisational-level dynamics that are shaping WoM in a MT context. The role of professional identity and the increasing commercialisation of medical care has been overlooked as a research topic, with only a small body of literature examining this key facet of MT (Skountridaki, 2017).Our service-delivery focus offers an important new perspective on the organisational-level dynamics that are shaping WoM in a MT context.

        <p>Recognising that patient evaluations of their experience at a MT facility can be formed by interactions with any member of staff (from porter through to surgeon), we draw on empirical materials from all job families in the hospital to understand some of the positive and negative factors influencing value creation (O'Cass &amp; Sok, 2015;Taheri et al., 2017). Interestingly, while senior medics worry about their professional identity (i.e., not being viewed as 'entertainers'), administrative and support staff were increasingly consumed by pressures relating to accreditation and ranking. These findings offer an interesting counterpoint to recent research from a patient perspective (Lovelock &amp; Lovelock, 2018) which stresses that medical tourists have often high expectations of a leisure component, which we suggest could be undermined by clinical staff who are not sufficiently 'on board.'Recognising that patient evaluations of their experience at a MT facility can be formed by interactions with any member of staff (from porter through to surgeon), we draw on empirical materials from all job families in the hospital to understand some of the positive and negative factors influencing value creation (O'Cass &amp; Sok, 2015;Taheri et al., 2017).

        <p>Research has highlighted the importance of WoM for MT service providers, yet the key antecedents in a medical tourism context are, thus far, less understood. MT providers must deliver service provision to patients who have dual expectations related to their medical treatment and also their wider tourism experience (Yu &amp; Ko, 2012). In this research, we find that tourism and service experience are both positively related to WoM referrals and that perceptions of value are determined by both. We conclude by highlighting the criticality of perceptions of service quality on WoM directly and also mediated through perceived value.Research has highlighted the importance of WoM for MT service providers, yet the key antecedents in a medical tourism context are, thus far, less understood.

        <p>Our findings highlight the salience of supporting service quality to the overall service experience of MT patients. Thus, medical service providers need to pay attention to the 'softer' elements of service delivery such as ease of payments, free internet provision and hospital amenities as well as the actual medical care.Our findings highlight the salience of supporting service quality to the overall service experience of MT patients.

        <p>We also offer a novel perspective on MT by soliciting data from both consumers of MT services and those who participate in the delivery of MT services (ranging from doctors to hospital managers). Extant MT research has typically focussed on patient data alone (e.g., Yeoh et al., 2013) and this has restricted understanding of the service dimension of MT. We therefore offer a valuable insight into aspects of service delivery through our qualitative data by unpacking how everyday service delivery tensions encountered by medics and support staff may influence evaluations from MT patients. Our MT provider data for example, shows some of the tensions faced within medical facilities by those who have to provide medical care, while also providing a tourism 'experience.' Rather than finding outright hostility, or resentment towards the dual role, we found staff across different positions keen to try adapting to the competitive situation, though this is not without challenges, as our data indicates.We also offer a novel perspective on MT by soliciting data from both consumers of MT services and those who participate in the delivery of MT services (ranging from doctors to hospital managers).

        <p>We suggest future studies develop this perspective further to understand how those with different roles might experience the demands of MT care differently, and how this leads to variances in how they interact with patients and influence WoM.We suggest future studies develop this perspective further to understand how those with different roles might experience the demands of MT care differently, and how this leads to variances in how they interact with patients and influence WoM.</p>
        <p>Our findings provide some important implications for practitioners too. Specifically, we confirm the importance of destination and medical care on perceived value (and ultimately, likelihood of the patient to refer). As past literature underlines the importance of WoM for generating medical tourism business (Abubakar, 2016), we emphasise the need for hospital managers to consider both aspects of service delivery proportionately. This may entail MT providers working to extend their influence over external destination factors that may presently be beyond their control. For example, we note successful instances of retail and tourism businesses working together to fund business or tourism improvement districts that shape broader aspects of destination experience (e.g., language support for workers at key sites of interest, public realm upgrading, cleanliness and transport improvement). Second, we find that MT providers use other local hospitals as competitive benchmarks, and a result there is a trend towards replicating each other's strategies (which mostly involves adding more services and expanding). We suggest an alternative strategy for MT providers in crowded local markets is to identify differentiating high-value specialisms that will draw patients from non-traditional markets. Existing strategies risk dilution of capabilities and a race to the bottom in terms of price, which undermines the sustainability of the MT sector in Iran. Third, the quantitative results confirmed the direct and/or indirect effects of MTI, tourism involvement, destination distinction, medical staff quality, supporting service quality, perceived value on medical tourists' WoM. Understanding tourism experience and medical service quality may prove critical to producing a sustainable medical tourism economy in the developing Iranian context.Our findings provide some important implications for practitioners too.

        <p>To provide a high-quality medical tourism, local authorities, hospital staff and tourism planners should invest both time and money in increasing level of tourism experience (i.e., tourism involvement and destination distinction) and medical service quality (i.e., medical staff quality and supporting service quality).To provide a high-quality medical tourism, local authorities, hospital staff and tourism planners should invest both time and money in increasing level of tourism experience (i.e., tourism involvement and destination distinction) and medical service quality (i.e., medical staff quality and supporting service quality).</p>
        <p>Moreover, by carefully crafting marketing communications, service trails and creating awareness through targeted campaigns in different places with the aim of motivating WoM communication (e.g., billboards in international airports, instant photo sharing about different medical and tourism experiences in social media platforms), the tourism experience and medical service quality elements can be promoted to different target audiences and segments.Moreover, by carefully crafting marketing communications, service trails and creating awareness through targeted campaigns in different places with the aim of motivating WoM communication (e.g., billboards in international airports, instant photo sharing about different medical and tourism experiences in social media platforms), the tourism experience and medical service quality elements can be promoted to different target audiences and segments.</p>

        <p>Similarly, our data does not consider the nature of treatment as a potentially significant variable in how WoM is configured. Studies have begun to unpick the differences is purely cosmetic treatments and those that are more essential to long-term health (Chuang et al., 2014) and we recommend this warrants further examination.Similarly, our data does not consider the nature of treatment as a potentially significant variable in how WoM is configured.

        <p>Additionally, we recognise that few scholars (e.g., Lovelock &amp; Lovelock, 2018) have considered how those accompanying patients on trips may shape WoM (89.4% of our survey participants had a friend or family member accompanying them). The interpersonal dynamics between the patient and these additional travellers may yield further insights into WoM. For example, as one may imagine emotions such as guilt at travelling to a destination with high medical staff quality but lower tourism involvement (and hence a worse experience for travel companions) skewing WoM. Thus, we advocate a move from studying the patient as the focal unit of analysis in MT (Fetscherin &amp; Stephano, 2016) and encourage a move towards a holistic 'customer decision-making unit' that involves patients and travel companions. This, we conclude, would more accurately reflect the cognitive work associated with WoM and the reality of MT service consumption. recent research that has examined how pre-consumption experiences influence perceived value of products and services (Jiang, Luk, &amp; Cardinali, 2018).Additionally, we recognise that few scholars (e.g., Lovelock &amp; Lovelock, 2018) have considered how those accompanying patients on trips may shape WoM (89.4% of our survey participants had a friend or family member accompanying them).
