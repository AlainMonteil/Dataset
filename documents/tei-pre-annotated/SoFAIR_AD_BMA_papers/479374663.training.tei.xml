        <p>The importance of skilled labor and the inalienability of human capital expose firms to the risk of losing talent at critical times. Using Swedish microdata, we document that firms lose workers with the highest cognitive and noncognitive skills as they approach bankruptcy. In a quasi-experiment, we confirm that financial distress drives these results: following a negative export shock caused by exogenous currency movements, talent abandons the firm, but only if the exporter is highly leveraged. Consistent with talent dependence being associated with higher labor costs of financial distress, firms that rely more on talent have more conservative capital structures.The importance of skilled labor and the inalienability of human capital expose firms to the risk of losing talent at critical times.

        <p>Several challenges must be overcome in attempting to answer such a question. First and foremost, an in-depth analysis of the labor force in financially distressed firms requires detailed, microlevel data on individual characteristics, job nature, and reasons for departure (voluntary or involuntary), among other factors. Data of such granularity are not typically available. The empirical hurdles are further compounded by the measurement question of how to define and measure talent. Since human capital is multidimensional, this is not straightforward. Finally, one needs a suitable approach to gauge whether the distress experienced by a firm is financial or economic. This latter distinction is critical because it is the cost of financial distress that matters for financial policy.Several challenges must be overcome in attempting to answer such a question.

        <p>In this paper, we employ microlevel data from Sweden to overcome these challenges. Our employee-employer matched data set contains detailed information on firm characteristics, as well as individual employee characteristics such as cognitive and noncognitive skills, age, gender, education, employment history, and compensation. These data allow us to paint a comprehensive picture of the evolution of the labor force in firms approaching financial distress. 2 The data set also allows us to create meaningful proxies for talent. We define and measure talent as a set of cognitive and noncognitive abilities that are generally applicable across tasks and jobs. Although human capital is multifaceted, cognitive and noncognitive skills are closest to the innate concept of talent that we are attempting to capture. 3 Prior studies show that cognitive and noncognitive skills are important determinants of education and labor market outcomes (e.g., Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzua (2006), Lindqvist and Vestman (2011)). Such skills are also closely associated with firm productivity and value creation (e.g., Abowd et al. (2005)). Employees with high cognitive and noncognitive skills may be particularly indispensable during critical times, such as financial distress, when firms face unique challenges.

        <p>3 Other forms of and proxies for human capital may also be important. However, we believe that cognitive and noncognitive skills are the most accurate proxy available to study the type of labor cost of financial distress that is of interest in this paper, which focuses on the risk of losing workers whose abilities are widely applicable and sought after in the economy. Moreover, measurement issues hinder the interpretation of proxies for other dimensions of human capital. For example, long tenure in the firm may indicate the existence of valuable firm-specific human capital. However, workers with long tenure may also be "legacy" workers who are apathetic, unmotivated, and resistant to change. Another example is education. As pointed out by Philippon and Reshef (2012), there is significant variation in human capital within similar educational groups, and the skills associated with any particular level of education may change over time.3 Other forms of and proxies for human capital may also be important.

        <p>We begin by investigating whether high-talent employees are prone to leaving firms that are approaching financial distress. Our main finding is that firms that become financially distressed do indeed experience a significant loss of talent. Workers with the highest cognitive and noncognitive skills are 65% more likely to abandon the firm as it approaches distress, relative to the average worker. Further, we find that the intake of talent in distressed firms does not increase commensurably. Given the importance of talent for firm productivity and value, the fact that high-talent workers abandon firms that are approaching bankruptcy can be seen as a labor cost of financial distress.We begin by investigating whether high-talent employees are prone to leaving firms that are approaching financial distress.

        <p>In our study, it is critical to separate demand-and supply-side factors that lead to a change in the labor composition of distressed firms. For instance, a lower reliance on talent may be the optimal strategy of a profit-maximizing firm that is experiencing financial distress. Information on which departures are voluntary and which are forced (i.e., firing) is rarely coded in any data set. Although we do not have access to such information, we use two approaches to identify voluntary departures. Under the first approach, we examine whether an employee who leaves a firm is subsequently unemployed. Our conjecture is that forced departures would tend to be associated with unemployment, while voluntary departures would be less likely to result in unemployment. We find no evidence of firms firing high-talent workers at an increased rate during financial distress.In our study, it is critical to separate demand-and supply-side factors that lead to a change in the labor composition of distressed firms.

        <p>Our second strategy exploits a unique institutional feature of labor laws in Sweden to separate voluntary from involuntary turnover. Firms with 11 or more employees are required by law to follow a last-in-first-out (LIFO) rule when laying workers off. 4 Because we know employees' joining date, we can determine whether job separations follow the LIFO rule. Deviations from this rule provide us a proxy for voluntary departures. We find that high-talent employees are more likely to leave voluntarily-in effect, "jumping the queue" and leaving earlier than their LIFO order should dictate. Taken together, our results point to firms' top talent voluntarily "abandoning the sinking ship" in times of financial distress.Our second strategy exploits a unique institutional feature of labor laws in Sweden to separate voluntary from involuntary turnover.

        <p>After establishing that we are indeed documenting voluntary rather than involuntary departures by highly skilled employees, we conduct a test aimed at empirically separating financial distress from economic distress. That is, we address the question: Does top talent leave because the firm ceases to be economically viable or because the firm is financially distressed? To answer this question, we consider a sample of Swedish firms exporting to different countries. The idea underlying the test is that a large, exogenous decrease in the value of exports due to unfavorable exchange rate movements is likely to be detrimental to all exporting firms, but the likelihood of financial distress will increase more for highly levered exporters. This allows us to distinguish between financial and economic distress. To implement the test, we follow Caggese, Cunat, and Metzger (2019) and determine an exporter's exposure to a set of currencies based on the exporting firm's trade partners at the start of the sample period. We then define a shock as a large depreciation of the trading partners' currencies relative to the domestic currency (Swedish Krona). 5 We first document that the likelihood of a firm going bankrupt in the years immediately following an unfavorable exchange rate shock significantly increases, but only if the firm is highly leveraged ex ante. After confirming that the setting is indeed helpful in disentangling the effects of financial and economic distress, we study the impact of this shock on the likelihood of talent leaving. We find that following a large negative export shock, top talent in highly leveraged firms (compared to such talent in low-leverage firms experiencing the shock) are significantly more likely to leave. This constitutes compelling evidence that our main results are indeed driven by financial distress. In addition, by observing the shock that led to the financial distress, this test helps rule out the concern that labor market forces (such as key employees leaving the firm) drive the bankruptcy filing in the first place.After establishing that we are indeed documenting voluntary rather than involuntary departures by highly skilled employees, we conduct a test aimed at empirically separating financial distress from economic distress.

        <p>Finally, we provide some evidence supporting the view that the risk of losing employee talent may affect firm leverage ex ante, a prediction consistent with the trade-off theory of capital structure. The risk of losing talent could affect firms with a high average level of talent, but it might also pose a threat to firms whose talent is concentrated in a small group of employees. The reason is that firms in which the entire workforce has a high level of talent may be better able to survive the departure of key employees than a firm in which talent is concentrated and hence such departures would severely deplete the overall talent pool. We find that the dependence of firms on a highly skilled and highly mobile labor force is associated with lower leverage in the crosssection of Swedish firms. We show that it is not only the average talent level in the organization that matters-the degree to which cognitive and noncognitive skills are concentrated in a few key individuals within the firm is also negatively associated with financial leverage. This suggests that a firm's dependence on a small number of high-talent individuals constitutes a source of fragility. Taken as a whole, the results support the view that employees with the highest talent are more likely to desert a firm that is in financial distress, thereby providing evidence of an indirect cost of financial distress associated with the loss of talent.Finally, we provide some evidence supporting the view that the risk of losing employee talent may affect firm leverage ex ante, a prediction consistent with the trade-off theory of capital structure.

        <p>Our paper connects several strands of literature in finance. First, our paper contributes to a growing literature that studies the interactions between finance and labor. 6 Within that literature, our work is most closely related to research that studies the interaction between labor and capital structure (see Matsa (2018) for a recent review of this literature). Specifically, our work adds to Graham et al. (2016), who find a significant loss in the wages of workers employed by firms at the time of bankruptcy, and Caggese, Cunat, and Metzger (2019), who argue that financial constraints distort firms' firing decisions.Our paper connects several strands of literature in finance.

        <p>Our paper also complements recent work by Brown and Matsa (2016), who use data from an online job search portal to examine how the onset of financial distress affects a firm's ability to hire workers. They find that not only do distressed firms receive fewer applications, but the average quality of applicants is also lower, thus providing evidence on the labor costs of financial distress. We build on this key insight in several ways. First, we explicitly document the characteristics of workers who leave and join financially distressed firms. The granularity of our data allows us to measure talent, our main characteristic of interest, very precisely. Because we can also measure other individual traits (job tenure, age, gender, etc.), we can provide ancillary evidence on the characteristics of employees who leave and join financially distressed firms. 7 Second, we focus on the ability of firms to both attract and retain workers. Failing to attract talent to the organization (as documented by Brown and Matsa (2016)) would not be a significant problem if firms were not losing high-talent employees in times of financial distress. However, we find that firms fail to retain their top talent. Furthermore, by focusing on realized departures, hiring outcomes, and leverage decisions, we are able to paint a comprehensive picture of how labor composition changes around bankruptcy and how this relates to financial policies.Our paper also complements recent work by Brown and Matsa (2016), who use data from an online job search portal to examine how the onset of financial distress affects a firm's ability to hire workers.

        <p>Finally, our paper contributes to the literature on firms' capital structures and their determinants (for a recent review of this literature, see Graham and Leary (2011)). Specifically, we add to the literature that documents and measures the costs of financial distress (e.g., Weiss (1990), Andrade and Kaplan (1998), Maksimovic and Phillips (1998), Hortaçsu et al. (2013)). We provide evidence that a firm's reliance on talent can make it fragile, especially when that talent is embodied by a small elite within the firm, and we propose such fragility as a potential determinant of capital structure.Finally, our paper contributes to the literature on firms' capital structures and their determinants (for a recent review of this literature, see Graham and Leary (2011)).

        <p>A distinguishing strength of the Swedish data is the possibility of linking the information from LISA to measures of cognitive and noncognitive skills using military records. The military data cover the period 1968 to 2011 and are obtained from the National Archives ("Riksarkivet") and the Swedish Defence Recruitment Agency ("Rekryteringsmyndigheten"). 8 Between 1968 and 2009, all Swedish males aged 18 or over were required to participate in enlistment tests for one to two days. 9 The enlistment tests consisted of four parts, assessing cognitive ability, noncognitive ability, physical ability, and health status. Whether someone had to perform military service was determined by their health status, while the capacity in which they served was determined by the joint outcome of all of the tests. The cognitive ability test comprised four parts: synonyms, inductions, spatial reasoning, and technical comprehension; the combined score from the four parts was converted to a cognitive ability score from one to nine on the Stanine scale.10 Noncognitive ability was assessed through a structured interview with a psychologist, who graded test-takers on psychological abilities (the score was also mapped onto the Stanine scale). Individuals who have the following character traits obtain high noncognitive test scores: willingness to assume responsibility, independence, outgoing character, persistence, emotional stability, initiative, and ability to work in groups (for further details, see Lindqvist and Vestman (2011)). In addition, the psychologist assessed leadership ability in all test-takers who received at least an average score on the cognitive ability test. Lindqvist and Vestman (2011) and Adams, Keloharju, and Knüpfer (2018) show that these measures relate to labor market outcomes in a meaningful way.A distinguishing strength of the Swedish data is the possibility of linking the information from LISA to measures of cognitive and noncognitive skills using military records.

        <p>We employ several data samples in our analysis. With our first sample, we explore changes in the composition of the labor force as firms approach bankruptcy. We start with all Swedish limited liability firms and categorize them into two groups. The first group, which we call the bankruptcy group, contains firms that experience a bankruptcy during our sample period, have nonmissing accounting data, and have at least five military test-takers five years prior to bankruptcy. 11 We also require firms to have at least one military test-taker during each of the five years preceding the bankruptcy event. 12 We define a bankruptcy event as either filing for bankruptcy under the Swedish Bankruptcy Code or filing for reorganization under the Swedish Company Reconstruction Code (see Section I.A of the Internet Appendix for a detailed discussion of the Swedish bankruptcy law).We employ several data samples in our analysis.

        <p>We next use a matching algorithm to construct a second group of firms, the nonbankruptcy group, which serves as a counterfactual for the firms approaching bankruptcy in the absence of such financial distress. Five years prior to bankruptcy, each of the firms in the bankruptcy group is matched to a firm that is observationally similar to but does not file for bankruptcy during our sample period. Specifically, we match nonbankruptcy firms to bankruptcy firms using a nearest-neighbor algorithm for a set of firm characteristics within calendar year and industry (Imbens et al. (2004)). 13 We use the following firm characteristics for the matching: Ln(Assets), the natural logarithm of total assets; Leverage, total debt divided by total assets; Profitability, EBITDA divided by total assets; number of employees; average worker wage; and Average skills, the firm-year average of all workers' (additively combined) noncognitive and cognitive skill scores. Because the firm-level accounting data start in 1998 and our matching procedure is performed five years prior to the start of bankruptcy, our final sample includes bankruptcy events from 2003 to 2011.We next use a matching algorithm to construct a second group of firms, the nonbankruptcy group, which serves as a counterfactual for the firms approaching bankruptcy in the absence of such financial distress.

Because the firm-level accounting data start in 1998 and our matching procedure is performed five years prior to the start of bankruptcy, our final sample includes bankruptcy events from 2003 to 2011.</p>
        <p>The average firm in the Swedish economy is small. In our sample, the average number of employees five years prior to bankruptcy is 33, and the 11 Table IA.XXIV in the Internet Appendix shows the distribution of test-takers by firm in Sweden during our sample period (also encompassing firms that are not included in our main bankruptcy sample).The average firm in the Swedish economy is small.

        <p>12 One caveat is that our methodology could lead to selection bias, as we condition on survival in the period of t -5 to t -1 relative to the bankruptcy. Because we impose the same restriction on the group of nonbankruptcy firms that we match with, this methodology is unlikely to affect the interpretation of our tests. 13 We define the following industries using SNI codes (the Swedish Standard Industrial classification): agriculture, manufacturing, transportation and utilities, construction and mining, commerce, professional services, other services, and finance. In the Internet Appendix, we present results using a narrower industry definition for the matching (Tables IA.XII and IA.XIII in the Internet Appendix). While matching at a finer industry level allows for greater comparability between bankruptcy and nonbankruptcy firms in terms of industrial classification, it leads to worse matching on other observable dimensions. Given this trade-off, we report the results using this alternative matching strategy in the Internet Appendix. median is 18.14 Panel A of Table I&gt; compares characteristics of bankruptcy and nonbankruptcy firms in the matching year (t -5). Unsurprisingly, bankruptcy and nonbankruptcy firms do not differ significantly along the characteristics on which we match. However, the matching also leads to similarities between bankruptcy and nonbankruptcy firms along dimensions that we observe but on which we do not match, such as workers' average number of years of education, the number of workers who took military enlistment tests, the average combined cognitive and noncognitive skills of the top 5% of workers, and export volume. 15 Panel B of Table I shows the distribution of corporate bankruptcies across industries in our sample. The total number of bankruptcies is 2,448; the number and frequency of bankruptcies is highest in the manufacturing industry, while it is lowest in the agriculture and financial sectors. 16 Panel C of Table I shows the distribution of bankruptcies over time in our sample. All sample years are well-represented in terms of bankruptcy events, with 2006 and 2007 being the years with the lowest numbers of bankruptcies and 2003 and 2009 the years with the highest numbers.12 One caveat is that our methodology could lead to selection bias, as we condition on survival in the period of t -5 to t -1 relative to the bankruptcy.

        <p>We match firms with their employees using the employee-employer links from LISA. For regressions studying labor transitions into and out of financially distressed firms, the sample consists of male workers with military test scores that are employed by the firm in at least one of the five years preceding bankruptcy. Workers are only part of the sample in the years they are employed by firms in the bankruptcy and nonbankruptcy groups. The sample spans the years 1998 to 2010 (using bankruptcies from 2003 to 2011).17We match firms with their employees using the employee-employer links from LISA.

        <p>Our second sample consists of exporting, nonfinancial limited liability firms. For the years 2000 to 2011, we have information on export revenue broken down by year and destination currency. We focus on exporting firms (firms with nonzero exports) with nonmissing information on assets, at least five employees, and at least five consecutive years of data. Firms enter this exporter sample the first year in which they have at least five military test-takers among their staff. Moreover, we exclude the first two observations of each firm from the final regression sample. The reason is that in our regression models, we want to hold fixed a firm's leverage and export exposure using information preceding the regression estimation ("pretreatment"). We therefore construct these variables using the first two years of data for each firm and then discard these two observations from the regression sample (which therefore starts in 2002).Our second sample consists of exporting, nonfinancial limited liability firms.

        <p>The two main variables that we use to study employee mobility are Leave and Join. The first, Leave, is a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 in the year a worker leaves the employer, and 0 otherwise. A worker's "employer" in a given calendar year is the firm that provides an individual with the most labor income in that year. To better capture voluntary turnover, the variable is 0 when a worker leaves an employer but collects unemployment benefits (even if only temporarily). The second main variable, Join, is a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 in the year an employee joins a new firm. We identify "joiners" by verifying whether the main source of labor income changed vis-àvis the previous year. 18 The (time-invariant) dummy variable Bankrupt takes the value of 1 for firms that at some point during our sample period file for bankruptcy. The variable Close identifies the period of interest, from three years to one year prior to the 18 One limitation of the annual frequency of the data is that the timing of job switches may sometimes be imprecisely measured. For example, suppose that an employee switches employer and has the same wages at both jobs. In LISA, the end of December is the cutoff date for considering annual income and for recording the employer that provided the largest source of income during the preceding 12 months. Because "leavers" are defined as having a different largest source of income in the next year, an employee who switches in July of year t will be classified as departing in year t, while an employee who switches in June of year t, will be classified as departing in year t -1. The same applies to the variable Join. The fact that this data limitation applies equally to bankruptcy firms and nonbankruptcy firms should mitigate concerns that it is driving our results. bankruptcy event. Figure 1, which shows the share of workers leaving and joining firms as they approach bankruptcy, suggests that our choice is meaningful. On average, the labor force appears stable until about four years prior to the onset of bankruptcy and then begins to contract. For bankruptcy firms, Close takes the value of 1 in years t -3, t -2, and t -1 relative to the bankruptcy filing and a value of 0 in years t -4 and t -5. It also takes the value of 1 for nonbankruptcy firms in years t -3 to t -1 relative to the matching date (which occurs at t -5); in other instances, Close takes the value of 0. Our tests can thus be interpreted as difference-in-differences estimates, where we compare the probability of workers leaving (or joining) distressed firms close to bankruptcy (t -3 to t -1) relative to "normal" times (t -5 and t -4) and relative to matched nonbankruptcy firms.The two main variables that we use to study employee mobility are Leave and Join.

        <p>Our measure of talent is based on the sum of the cognitive and noncognitive test scores of males obtained from their military records. Cognitive skills refer to an individual's ability to perform various mental activities closely associated with learning and problem solving. Noncognitive skills refer to personality, social, and emotional traits, such as empathy, sociability, conscientiousness, and perseverance. We define Top talent as a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if an individual has a combined cognitive and noncognitive test score in the top 5% of the distribution at the firm-year level, and 0 otherwise. 19 We thus define talent with reference to the distribution of skills within the firm. We do so because average skill levels vary across firms and industries (see Table II, Panel A, for a summary of how cognitive and noncognitive skill scores vary across industries), and we are interested in understanding whether within each organization, high-talent workers comprise those most likely to "jump ship" as the firm becomes financially distressed. 20 In cases in which the top 5 th percentile cannot be unambiguously determined (because a firm has fewer than 20 workers who took the military tests or because the top scores are shared by more than 5% of the workers), Top talent takes the value of 1 for all workers who share the top score. 21 In all tests relying on military test scores, to adjust for the possibility of changes in test standards over time, we include fixed effects for the enrollment period as reported by the testing authority : 1969 to 1982, 1983 to 1997, 1998 to 2001, 2002 to 2008, and 2009 to 2010. For robustness, we construct additional measures of talent based on (respectively) cognitive skills, noncognitive skills, leadership skills, and wages (the latter proxy is available for both men and women). We discuss these alternative proxies in Section IV. Panel A of Table II shows the distribution of skills across industries in Sweden. Specifically, it shows industry averages of the sum of workers' cognitive and noncognitive skill scores. The industries for which these skills are highest are professional services (which includes, among others, workers in IT, R&amp;D, law, and consulting) and other services (which includes workers in education and health care). Panel B of Table II reports the skill distribution across different hierarchy levels. The table shows that higher hierarchy levels tend to have more highly skilled workers. Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, the third hierarchy level ("senior staff" members) tends to have marginally more highly skilled workers on average than the top level ("CEOs and directors"). This is due to the relatively large number of small firms in the Swedish economy that tend to have flat hierarchical structures and less skilled CEOs, as measured by cognitive and noncognitive skill scores (see also Adams, Keloharju, and Knüpfer (2018)). 22 Ln(Years of education) is the natural logarithm of an individual's years of schooling.23 Ln(Wage) is the natural logarithm of gross wage, paid by the main employer (i.e., the employer that provided the largest source of income during the year). We define two variables measuring work experience: Short tenure is a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if the number of years worked at the current firm is fewer than the sample median, 24 and Experience in industry is the number of years worked in the current industry. Both variables are censored due to the start of available employment histories in 1990. Other municipality is an indicator that is equal to 1 if a worker moves to a new municipality (that is, changes place of residence to a different municipality, whether or not he or she changes employment).Our measure of talent is based on the sum of the cognitive and noncognitive test scores of males obtained from their military records.

        <p>Individual-level information on occupational tasks is available from 2001 onward. This information is reported using the Swedish Standard Classification of Occupations 1996 (SSYK), which is the Swedish version of the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO). We follow Tåg (2013) and construct a measure of hierarchy by mapping occupational codes into four different hierarchy levels: CEOs and directors, senior staff, supervisors, and clerks and "blue-collar" workers.Individual-level information on occupational tasks is available from 2001 onward.

First, Unemployed is an indicator variable that takes the value of 1 if a worker leaves a firm and transitions into unemployment. A transition into unemployment is recorded if a worker receives any unemployment insurance payments in the year of the separation or the next. 25 Second, Jumped the queue is a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 in a given year if (i) a worker is no longer with the same employer in the following year, and (ii) this separation event deviates from the order mandated by the LIFO rule, which is based on the tenure of workers at the firm in that year. The variable is set to 0 if (i) the worker is no longer at the same employer in the following year but the separation is consistent with the LIFO rule, or (ii) the worker collects unemployment insurance benefits in the year of the separation or the next. This variable is only defined for workers who leave a bankrupt firm in years t -3 to t -1 relative to the bankruptcy filing year.Finally, in our worker-level analysis, we also employ two alternative dependent variables in certain specifications.

Finally, our main variable of interest is the Exchange rate shock dummy variable, which takes the value of 1 when a firm suffers a negative shock to the value of its exports, that is, when the firm (given its export exposure) experiences negative exchange rate movements. Specifically, the dummy takes the value of 1 when (i) the annual exchange rate movement index (the scalar product between the Export exposure vector and the currency vector) is negative, indicating an appreciation of the Swedish Krona vis-à-vis the exporter's relevant trading partner currencies, and (ii) the exchange rate 27 For a new firm, the first year may not be representative of its steady-state export intensity, and thus, we also consider the second year.Next, we construct an annual exchange rate movement index by calculating the scalar product between the Export exposure vector and a vector of relative exchange rate changes between the current and previous year for the five currencies considered (the exchange rates in the currency vector are quoted as SEK per foreign currency).

        <p>28 Exports denominated in these five currencies account for more than two-thirds of total Swedish exports during our sample period. We focus on these top five export currencies to simplify the analysis. The distribution of exports during our sample period is as follows: 38% of exports (by value) are to Eurozone countries, 9% to Norway, 9% to the United States, 8% to the United Kingdom, and 6% to Denmark. Other countries comprise 30% of exports; the biggest three are China (2.5%), Poland (2%), and Russia (1.5%). movement index is in the bottom 5% of the distribution of the index across all years of the sample. 29 To differentiate between high-leverage and low-leverage firms, we construct the (time-invariant) dummy variable High leverage. As in the case of export shares, we average the first two observations of Leverage for each firm in the sample; High leverage takes the value of 1 if a firm's average leverage ratio is above the sample median. We note that both Export exposure and High leverage are defined using historical information (relative to the information used in the regressions) and hence are less subject (albeit not immune) to endogeneity concerns, such as firms adjusting leverage or the choice of their trade partners as a consequence of a negative currency shock. Finally, the variable Bankrupt in &lt;3 years takes the value of 1 if a given firm files for bankruptcy in the current year, next year, or year thereafter, and 0 otherwise.

        <p>We define Leverage as the sum of short-and long-term bank debt (plus corporate bonds, if any) divided by total assets, Tangibility as property, plant, and equipment divided by total assets, Ln(Assets) as the natural logarithm of total assets, and Profitability as EBITDA divided by total assets. These four measures are winsorized at the 1 st and 99 th percentiles. We next define Short tenure share and Average experience in industry as, respectively, the mean of Short tenure and mean Experience in industry at the firm-year level, while Firm age is the number of years since incorporation. We also examine differences in leverage between financially constrained and unconstrained firms. The typical financial constraint measures considered in the empirical corporate finance literature are constructed using U.S. data and cannot be directly applied in a Swedish setting. However, we conceptually follow Hadlock and Pierce (2010) to group firms into constrained and unconstrained sets. 30 The variable Constrained is a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 for firms that are "small and young" and 0 for firms that are "large and old." Specifically, we sort observations into two quantiles of firm age and two quantiles of assets (deflated to 1998 SEK). We then classify a firm as financially constrained in a given year (that is, Constrained takes the value of 1) if both its age and assets are less than or equal to the sample median, and as unconstrained if both its age and assets are above the sample median.We define Leverage as the sum of short-and long-term bank debt (plus corporate bonds, if any) divided by total assets, Tangibility as property, plant, and equipment divided by total assets, Ln(Assets) as the natural logarithm of total assets, and Profitability as EBITDA divided by total assets. These four measures are winsorized at the 1 st and 99 th percentiles. We next define Short tenure share and Average experience in industry as, respectively, the mean of Short tenure and mean Experience in industry at the firm-year level, while Firm age is the number of years since incorporation. We also examine differences in leverage between financially constrained and unconstrained firms. The typical financial constraint measures considered in the empirical corporate finance literature are constructed using U.S. data and cannot be directly applied in a Swedish setting.

        <p>In these firm-level regressions, we employ two measures of firm talent: Average skills, the mean of the combined cognitive and noncognitive skill scores of the employees working in a firm in a given year, and Talent concentration, the fraction of the total combined cognitive and noncognitive skills at a firm in a given year that are held by the top 5% of workers within that firm-year. 31 The latter measure, which is the firm-level analog of the dummy variable Top talent in our worker mobility analysis, captures the firm's dependence on the human capital of its most skilled employees.In these firm-level regressions, we employ two measures of firm talent: Average skills, the mean of the combined cognitive and noncognitive skill scores of the employees working in a firm in a given year, and Talent concentration, the fraction of the total combined cognitive and noncognitive skills at a firm in a given year that are held by the top 5% of workers within that firm-year. 31 The latter measure, which is the firm-level analog of the dummy variable Top talent in our worker mobility analysis, captures the firm's dependence on the human capital of its most skilled employees.</p>

        <p>We begin by studying the evolution of the labor force composition in firms approaching bankruptcy. Specifically, we examine the selection and characteristics of workers who leave and of those who join firms prior to bankruptcy. Workers with different characteristics may have different preferences and incentives to leave (or join) firms approaching bankruptcy. Moreover, the mobility of workers may be determined by the extent to which their human capital can be generally applied in the economy.We begin by studying the evolution of the labor force composition in firms approaching bankruptcy.

        <p>Among all workers who may desert a firm as it becomes financially distressed, the loss of key talent (defined using innate cognitive and noncognitive abilities that are generally applicable in different tasks and jobs) is likely to be especially critical for the firm's ability to survive and create value. 32 Consistent with this notion, we observe a positive and increasing talent wage premium in Sweden (Figure 2). This increase is particularly pronounced at the top of the talent distribution: workers above the 95 th percentile of the distribution of cognitive and noncognitive skills in the economy experienced considerably larger growth in their wage premium than those above the median.Among all workers who may desert a firm as it becomes financially distressed, the loss of key talent (defined using innate cognitive and noncognitive abilities that are generally applicable in different tasks and jobs) is likely to be especially critical for the firm's ability to survive and create value. 32 Consistent with this notion, we observe a positive and increasing talent wage premium in Sweden (Figure 2).

        <p>There are several reasons why high-talent workers may decide to leave a firm early, in anticipation of bankruptcy. One possibility is that these workers are better able to predict the likelihood of their firm's bankruptcy and thus time their exit decision better. Furthermore, because such workers are likely to have more influence on firm performance, the cost they may face in being associated with a failed enterprise could be larger than for the average worker. However, high-talent workers may be better able to hedge bankruptcy risk. 31 Specifically, this variable is defined as follows. For each firm and year, we rank workers based on their combined cognitive and noncognitive ability scores to identify the workers in the top 5 th percentile ("top 5% workers"; see the procedure described for the variable Top talent). We then sum the cognitive and noncognitive ability scores for the top 5% workers and divide this number by the total sum of the cognitive and noncognitive ability scores of all workers in the firm-year. This ratio is then adjusted by the factor (0.05/share of workers in the top 5% of the talent distribution), which ensures that this variable does not mechanically capture a firm size effect. The resulting number is the variable Talent concentration.There are several reasons why high-talent workers may decide to leave a firm early, in anticipation of bankruptcy.

        <p>32 Abowd et al. (2005) find that the most skilled workers in a firm have a disproportionately positive impact on the firm's productivity and market value.

        <p>Figures 1 and3 examine these effects graphically. Figure 1 shows that, relative to nonbankruptcy firms, the fraction of workers leaving increases as a firm approaches bankruptcy. In contrast, the fraction of workers joining the firm evolves similarly for firms in the bankruptcy and nonbankruptcy groups. Figure 3 shows the share of high-talent workers (as a fraction of total male workers with cognitive and noncognitive skill scores employed in the firmyear) leaving and joining firms. The pattern documented in Figure 3 indicates an overall deterioration of the talent pool in bankruptcy firms over time.

        <p>We formally test whether proximity to bankruptcy is correlated with an increase in the probability that top talent workers leave the firm by estimating a linear probability model. We compare the probability that a worker at the top of the within-firm talent distribution abandons the firm as it approaches distress, relative to high-talent workers in nonbankruptcy firms. The regression specification that we estimate also includes a set of individual worker characteristics that could affect the probability of leaving prior to bankruptcy events. In particular, we control for worker age, tenure in the firm, experience in the industry, years of education, and wages (lagged by one year). Moreover, we estimate the extent to which workers who depart close to bankruptcy differ from those who leave at other times. To account for time-invariant differences in turnover across firms that may occur for reasons other than bankruptcy, the regressions also include firm fixed effects. Industry-year fixed effects account for the evolution of the optimal composition of workers at the industry level. Thus, our results are not driven by the possibility that, for example, industries with more bankruptcies are also those from which more talented employees are leaving. Finally, we cluster standard errors at the firm level.We formally test whether proximity to bankruptcy is correlated with an increase in the probability that top talent workers leave the firm by estimating a linear probability model.

In columns ( 2) and (3), we analyze the composition of workers who leave bankruptcy firms close to distress. An important pattern that emerges is an increase in the propensity of top talent to leave as a firm approaches bankruptcy. In column (2), we show that workers with high talent have a 4.2 percentage point higher probability of leaving the firm as it approaches bankruptcy than less skilled workers.

        <p>In periods of distress, firms facing financial constraints might have to dismiss their most skilled employees, as they may also be the most expensive.

        <p>At the outset, it should be noted that our findings reported in Table IV are unlikely to be driven by firms firing their most expensive workers in times of distress because we control for wages in our tests. We also interact Ln(Wage) with Close × Bankrupt to allow for the possibility that firms may be particularly cost-sensitive prior to bankruptcy. In other words, to be consistent with our results, if firms were choosing between two similarly paid workers to lay off, they would choose to let go of the more skilled worker. Instead, the most natural explanation for our findings is that we are capturing the decision of high-talent workers to leave firms voluntarily. Second, in the tests reported above, the variable Leave excludes transitions to unemployment, to capture voluntary turnover as accurately as possible.At the outset, it should be noted that our findings reported in Table IV are unlikely to be driven by firms firing their most expensive workers in times of distress because we control for wages in our tests.

        <p>To further distinguish between voluntary and involuntary turnover, we examine which workers transition into unemployment after exiting the distressed firm. The logic here is that workers who become unemployed are more likely to have been laid off than those who abandon the firm and do not experience a period of unemployment. Specifically, in columns (1) and (2) of Table V, we repeat the analysis from Table IV but use a new dependent variable: Unemployed, which takes a value of 1 only if a worker leaves and transitions into unemployment. In column (1), we show that workers from bankruptcy firms are more likely to transition to unemployment compared to workers from nonbankruptcy firms. However, as shown in column (2), this effect is not more pronounced for high-talent workers, as the coefficient on the interaction term Close × Bankrupt × Top talent is economically and statistically insignificant. 34 This suggests that firms are not simply laying off their most skilled employees when approaching bankruptcy. One caveat with this analysis is that laid-off workers with high ability may be more likely to find other employment before collecting unemployment insurance benefits than low-ability workers (Table IA.XXI in the Internet Appendix provides some evidence that high-talent workers face a more liquid labor market than other workers). Next, we conduct two tests that exploit specific firing restrictions of the Swedish labor law to provide additional evidence that our main results are primarily a manifestation of voluntary departures.To further distinguish between voluntary and involuntary turnover, we examine which workers transition into unemployment after exiting the distressed firm.

        <p>When dismissing workers, firms with 11 or more employees must follow a LIFO rule that constrains their ability to lay off workers arbitrarily. 35 In columns (3) and (4) of Table V, we repeat our analysis for the subsample of firms that are bound by LIFO rules (firms with 11+ workers). Because these firms are limited in their ability to select which workers to fire and which to retain, it is difficult to argue that they simply fire the most skilled workers as part of a reorganization around bankruptcy. The results are similar to those reported in Table IV. This evidence further strengthens our interpretation that the most skilled workers "jump ship," in contrast to the view that organizations approaching bankruptcy have reduced need for talent and, as such, fire highly skilled employees.When dismissing workers, firms with 11 or more employees must follow a LIFO rule that constrains their ability to lay off workers arbitrarily. 35 In columns (3) and (4) of Table V, we repeat our analysis for the subsample of firms that are bound by LIFO rules (firms with 11+ workers).

        <p>One potential concern is that LIFO is not enforced and, as a result, is not a de facto firing restriction. However, von Below and Thoursie (2010) provide evidence to the contrary: they find that both hiring and separation probabilities significantly increased for small firms after the LIFO restriction was relaxed in 2001 for such firms. We provide similar evidence in Section III of the Internet Appendix. Specifically, we report tests that show that the LIFO rule does indeed affect the firing decisions of firms (see Table IA In sum, the evidence in this subsection lends support to our interpretation that the effects documented in Table IV are most consistent with high-talent workers voluntarily abandoning firms that become financially distressed.One potential concern is that LIFO is not enforced and, as a result, is not a de facto firing restriction.

        <p>Results are reported in Table VI. We first note that the estimate of Close × Bankruptcy in column (1) is negative, which implies that firms attract fewer employees as they approach bankruptcy. According to column (1), bankruptcy firms have a 0.8 percentage point lower fraction of new employees in the three years preceding bankruptcy relative to normal times (this coefficient is not statistically significantly different from zero). Importantly, in regressions reported in columns ( 2) and (3), we find that being close to bankruptcy does not enhance the ability of firms to attract highly skilled individuals in an economically or statistically significant way. Despite the loss of talent documented in Table IV, bankruptcy firms are unable to replace the human capital lost by attracting highly skilled employees in sufficiently larger numbers. We also find that the characteristics of workers who join financially distressed firms differ from the types of employees joining firms at other times. According to column (3) of Table VI, workers commanding higher wages and those coming from other municipalities are less likely to join the firm, although these effects are not precisely estimated.Results are reported in Table VI.

        <p>The fact that we do not find a decrease in the hiring rate of high-talent employees relative to less skilled workers in firms approaching bankruptcy suggests that financially distressed firms do not choose to operate with lower levels of talent. If that were the case, firms would not only dismiss their most skilled employees, but would also likely stop hiring high-talent employees. In fact, if firms were aiming to voluntarily reduce the number of high-talent workers they employ, the natural first step would be to stop hiring talent even before beginning to lay off their most skilled workers. However, Brown and Matsa (2016) show that financially distressed firms continue posting job vacancies. In addition, we find that firms keep hiring high-talent employees at the same rate as less-skilled employees. In sum, our results suggest that even prior to bankruptcy, the pool of human capital available in the firm may deteriorate considerably.The fact that we do not find a decrease in the hiring rate of high-talent employees relative to less skilled workers in firms approaching bankruptcy suggests that financially distressed firms do not choose to operate with lower levels of talent.

In contrast, if bankruptcy and nonbankruptcy firms are comparable absent bankruptcy, we would expect to find no difference in the ability of bankruptcy firms to attract and retain talent relative to the nonbankruptcy group when focusing on a period further away from bankruptcy.The idea underlying the test is as follows: if bankruptcy and nonbankruptcy firms are different even in the absence of bankruptcy, we would expect to also find differences in the ability of bankruptcy and nonbankruptcy firms to attract and retain talent several years before bankruptcy.

        <p>Table VII reports results of this placebo test. Note that while we retain all of the variables in our regressions, we only report the coefficients associated with the interactions between Placebo close × Bankruptcy and the individual worker characteristics, to simplify the reading of the table (coefficients on the noninteracted worker characteristics are comparable to those reported in Tables IV and VI). We find that the coefficients on the interactions of the placebo treatment dummy Placebo close × Bankruptcy and the different worker characteristics are economically small and statistically insignificant. The only exception is with respect to employee age, where the triple interaction Placebo close × Bankruptcy × Age is statistically significant at the 5% level in column (5) and at the 10% level in column ( 6). Importantly, we find no evidence that in years more distant from the bankruptcy event, bankruptcy and nonbankruptcy firms behave differently with regard to retention (columns (1) to ( 3)) or attraction (columns (4) to ( 6)) of talent. This lends support to our identifying assumption that the nonbankruptcy group provides a good counterfactual for the evolution of talent in bankruptcy firms in the absence of bankruptcy. Of course, this test does not rule out differences in unobservables, which are inherently untestable.Table VII reports results of this placebo test.

The variable Placebo close takes a value of 1 in the years t -6 to t -4 relative to the bankruptcy event (t0) and the matching year (t -5).

The richness of our data allows us to construct firm-level exposures to different currencies, as we observe the value of exports by country of destination for each firm. We can therefore exploit, for identification purposes, the fact that a depreciation of the dollar, for example, would negatively impact the demand of firms that export to the United States while not directly affecting firms that only export to Norway. First, as a validation of our identification strategy, we estimate the impact of an exchange rate shock on the probability of filing for bankruptcy. Because different firms export to different markets, the exogenous variation that we exploit varies both over time and across firms, even within the same industry. This allows us to control for firm and industry-year fixed effects, as well as for a set of time-varying firm controls.In this table, we repeat the analyses of Tables IV and VI but for a "placebo" event period: we keep the composition of bankruptcy and nonbankruptcy groups but define the sample period as t -8 to t -4 relative to bankruptcy.

        <p>We present the results of this test in Table VIII. We find that exporting firms with high leverage (but not those with low leverage) are significantly more likely to file for bankruptcy in the years following an unfavorable exchange rate shock. Specifically, in column (1), we show that an exchange rate shock is associated with a 0.7 percentage point increase in the probability that a highly levered firm will file for bankruptcy in the year of the shock or the subsequent two years. Relative to the unconditional mean of the variable Bankrupt in &lt;3 years of 0.014 (see Table III), this constitutes an increase of 50% in the likelihood of going bankrupt. In column (2), we include a set of firm controls and find a quantitatively similar result. The results reported in Table VIII help us distinguish economic from financial distress: they show that a negative exchange rate shock, while plausibly harmful to the bottom line of all affected exporters, leads to financial distress only in firms that were highly leveraged ex ante.We present the results of this test in Table VIII.

        <p>After confirming that the setting is helpful in disentangling the effects of financial and economic distress, we study the impact of this shock on the likelihood of high-talent workers leaving. In these worker-level tests, the dependent variable is Leave, which, as before, takes the value of 1 in the year that a worker leaves the firm, and 0 otherwise. The coefficient of interest in these tests is the interaction between High leverage, Exchange rate shock, and Top talent (defined as in our previous tests). Since we are interested in estimating the increase in the likelihood of a high-talent worker leaving relative to that of other workers in the firm, these regressions include firm-year fixed effects that account for any time-varying firm-level unobservable. We report results in Table IX. In column (1), we find that the probability of a high-talent worker leaving a firm following an unfavorable exchange rate shock increases in the case of highly levered firms, as the interaction of Exchange rate shock, High leverage, and Top talent is positive and statistically significant. Relative to the average effect of being a Top talent worker on the probability of leaving a firm in a non-shock year (0.036), a high-talent worker is about 39% more likely to leave a highly leveraged exporter following a negative exchange rate shock. In column (2), we add hierarchy fixed effects to the specification of column (1) and observe similar results.After confirming that the setting is helpful in disentangling the effects of financial and economic distress, we study the impact of this shock on the likelihood of high-talent workers leaving.

        <p>One potential concern with the tests that exploit exchange rate movements in different currencies in addition to differences in ex ante capital structures is that firms with different levels of leverage and different export activity may differ along other dimensions. In Table A.II, we report separate summary statistics for firms in the export sample with high (above-median) and low leverage (Panel A), firms with high (above-median) and low export volume (Panel B), and export-intensive firms (those with above-median exports) with high and low leverage (Panel C). Unsurprisingly, and consistent with large literatures in corporate finance and international trade, we observe that capital structure and export activity are not randomly assigned: there are statistically significant differences-although most of them are economically smallbetween high-and low-leverage firms and between firms that export more and those that export less. Economically, the most significant differences are in terms of average numbers of employees. Low-leverage firms have more than twice the number of employees as high-leverage firms (Panels A and C of Table A.II), and high-export firms have almost twice the number of employees as low-export firms (Panel B of Table A.II).

        <p>Leave the size of the labor force, there are economically small differences in terms of the composition of the labor force among these groups of firms. The inclusion of firm-year fixed effects in our regression specifications (reported in Table IX) allows us to control for any time-varying unobservable factor that homogeneously affects all workers in any given firm and thus alleviates concerns that our results are driven by such firm-level omitted variables. However, if there are firm characteristics that differentially affect high-talent workers, our estimates may be biased. Given the exogenous nature of the exchange rate shock we employ, our analysis would recover the causal effect of financial distress on talent retention if worker turnover (as captured by the variable Leave) evolved similarly for shocked and nonshocked firms in the absence of the shock.Leave the size of the labor force, there are economically small differences in terms of the composition of the labor force among these groups of firms.

        <p>Although it is not easy to envisage the kind of economic mechanism that would give rise to the empirical patterns we document, we test whether firms not yet affected by the shock experience any premature response, which would raise concerns about the nature of the shock or the differences between firms that are experiencing a shock and those that are not. Specifically, in columns (3) and ( 4) of Table IX we test whether, prior to the exchange rate shock, firms that will be affected by an exchange rate shock in the following year experience more talent departures than firms that do not experience an exchange rate shock. For this purpose, we use the variable F1(Exchange rate shock), the oneyear lead term of the variable Exchange rate shock. We find that in the absence of the shock, these two groups of firms do not behave differently. Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that unobservable differences across firms may differentially affect high-talent workers, the evidence suggests that differences in unobservables are unlikely to be driving the results. Therefore, with all necessary caveats, we conclude that talent departures are likely driven by financial, rather than economic, distress.Although it is not easy to envisage the kind of economic mechanism that would give rise to the empirical patterns we document, we test whether firms not yet affected by the shock experience any premature response, which would raise concerns about the nature of the shock or the differences between firms that are experiencing a shock and those that are not.

        <p>The analysis in the previous section provides evidence that as firms approach financial distress, talent leaves. This may endanger the future of the company even further. Labor may thus bring an added degree of fragility to the organization, especially in cases in which most of the firm's human capital is concentrated in these key employees. In this section, we investigate whether the risk of talent loss may help explain firms' leverage choices. 38 We test whether the extent to which a firm relies on talent shapes its financial decisions by analyzing the capital structure choices of firms in the cross-section. Firms whose most skilled employees are more likely to leave in times of financial distress face large (indirect) bankruptcy costs and thus are expected to have lower leverage. In that sense, the employee composition of a firm, and in particular a firm's reliance on its highly skilled labor, would be an additional factor shaping firms' financial policy. We formally test whether the average level of talent and its concentration within the firm correlate with capital structure by estimating the regression:The analysis in the previous section provides evidence that as firms approach financial distress, talent leaves. This may endanger the future of the company even further. Labor may thus bring an added degree of fragility to the organization, especially in cases in which most of the firm's human capital is concentrated in these key employees. In this section, we investigate whether the risk of talent loss may help explain firms' leverage choices. 38 We test whether the extent to which a firm relies on talent shapes its financial decisions by analyzing the capital structure choices of firms in the cross-section.

        <p>The matrix X includes standard controls used in capital structure regressions: Tangibility, Profitability, Ln(Assets), and Firm age. Our firm-level talent measures are Average skills, the average of the combined cognitive and noncognitive skill scores of the employees working in a firm in a given year, and Talent concentration, the share of the firm's total endowment of cognitive and noncognitive skills that is held by the workers in the top 5% of the talent distribution within the firm. The matrix includes year fixed effects or, in some specifications, industry-year fixed effects to control for macroeconomic determinants of leverage. Thus, the coefficients in these regressions can be interpreted as cross-sectional comparisons.The matrix X includes standard controls used in capital structure regressions: Tangibility, Profitability, Ln(Assets), and Firm age.

        <p>Table XI, Panel A, reports the results. In column (1), we regress Leverage on our firm talent measures and year fixed effects, while in column (2) we include additional controls. The results confirm that the average level of talent in a firm's labor force is an important determinant of capital structure decisions. In both columns, leverage is negatively correlated with the Average skills of a firm. A one-standard-deviation increase in a firm's Average skills is associated with a 1.1 percentage point lower leverage ratio (column (2)). Relative to the average level of leverage in the sample (13.3%), this is 8.5% lower leverage than in the average firm. For comparison, a one-standard-deviation increase in Tangibility, Profitability, Ln(Assets), and Firm age is associated with 9.6, -2.5, -0.4, and -0.9 percentage point changes, respectively, in leverage. The estimate associated with Average skills is thus larger than the effect of a one-Table XI, Panel A, reports the results.

        <p>This table reports coefficients from regression models examining the relationship between the talent-intensity of firms and financial leverage. Panel A considers all firms, while Panel B focuses on the role of financial constraints. Average skills is the average of the combined cognitive and noncognitive skill scores of the employees working in a given firm-year. Talent concentration is the fraction of a given firm's total combined skill scores that is accounted for by workers who are at or above the 95 th percentile of the combined skill distribution in the firm-year. In Panel B, Constrained is a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 for firms that are "small and young," and 0 for firms that are "large and old.This table reports coefficients from regression models examining the relationship between the talent-intensity of firms and financial leverage.

        <p>In addition, we find that talent concentration at the top of the organization is also negatively correlated with leverage. A one-standard-deviation increase in Talent concentration is associated with a 0.4 percentage point decrease in leverage (column (2)). Relative to the sample mean of 13.3%, this corresponds to a 3% lower leverage ratio. The magnitude of this effect is economically similar to that of a one-standard-deviation increase in Ln(Assets). While Mueller, Ouimet, and Simintzi (2017) highlight the benefits associated with the existence of within-firm inequality, our results underscore the risks that may be associated with firms' dependence on a few (highly mobile) individuals. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to document that the degree of concentration of human capital within the firm may have implications for financial policy.In addition, we find that talent concentration at the top of the organization is also negatively correlated with leverage.

        <p>In column (3), we add industry-year fixed effects to the specification to identify cross-sectional differences in leverage within firms in the same industry and year. In columns ( 4) and ( 5), we add two additional measures of worker human capital to the specification: Short tenure share and Average experience in industry. These variables serve as proxies for the endowment of the firm's labor force with firm-and industry-specific human capital. The coefficient on Short tenure share is positive and significant in column ( 5). This could be because workers are unwilling to invest in firm-specific human capital for risky firms. Alternatively, it could suggest that firms with long-tenured workers (who may not be easily fired) have high operating leverage, which decreases their debt capacity (along the lines of Simintzi, Vig, and Volpin (2015)). The coefficient associated with Average experience in industry is economically small and statistically insignificant in both columns. The coefficients associated with Average skills and Talent concentration remain statistically and economically significant in these specifications.In column (3), we add industry-year fixed effects to the specification to identify cross-sectional differences in leverage within firms in the same industry and year.

        <p>The results reported in Panel A are consistent with two interpretations. First, according to a trade-off model of capital structure, the increased present value of the labor costs of financial distress due to increased talent departures at the onset of bankruptcy could lead firms to optimally use less leverage ex ante. Second, financiers may not supply debt to firms that rely heavily on talent. Both channels are in line with our hypothesis that a firm's reliance on talent introduces a degree of fragility that affects the firm's observed equilibrium capital structure. In a first attempt to evaluate the relative strength of the two potential channels, in Panel B of Table XI, we examine the correlation between talent intensity and financial leverage among two groups of firms: financially constrained firms and firms that are not constrained. 39 If the correlation between our talent measures and leverage is more negative in the group of financially unconstrained firms, it is plausible that the first mechanism (firms use less leverage if the risk of talent loss increases) dominates. In contrast, if one observes that the correlation between a firm's reliance on talent and leverage is more negative among financially constrained firms, this would lend more support to the debt capacity channel. In the specifications reported in Panel B, we interact Constrained with the two talent measures. Overall, we find support for the trade-off theory channel: the negative correlation between our talent measures and leverage is quantitatively larger in the group of financially unconstrained firms.The results reported in Panel A are consistent with two interpretations.

        <p>To alleviate concerns that our results are driven by spurious correlation, we include in the tests reported in Table XI year fixed effects and industry-year fixed effects, as well as several controls for other important determinants of leverage. We also present a variety of alternative specifications of these tests using different talent measures, additional controls, and variations of the regression sample (see Section III of the Internet Appendix). Notwithstanding, given the nature of these cross-sectional correlations, endogeneity concerns remain. For example, firms with lower leverage could attract workers who have higher talent instead of the firm's dependence on talent driving the choice of capital structure.To alleviate concerns that our results are driven by spurious correlation, we include in the tests reported in Table XI year fixed effects and industry-year fixed effects, as well as several controls for other important determinants of leverage.

        <p>In our tests, we use the sum of cognitive and noncognitive skill scores to construct measures of talent. Our results are robust to several alternative ways of measuring talent, particularly more narrow measures reflecting cognitive skills only, noncognitive skills only, or leadership ability. Furthermore, even though the measures of skill based on military test scores are accurate and economically meaningful (as documented in, e.g., Lindqvist and Vestman (2011)), they are only available for males. To extend our analysis to include females, we repeat our tests using a talent measure based on wages (which proxies for the market price of talent). We report a replication of our previously discussed findings on labor turnover and leverage based on these alternative measures of talent in Tables IA.VII, IA.VIII, and IA.XVI of the Internet Appendix.In our tests, we use the sum of cognitive and noncognitive skill scores to construct measures of talent.

        <p>When studying the evolution of the labor force composition, we defined hightalent employees as those whose combined cognitive and noncognitive skill scores belong to the top 5% of the distribution within the firm. In Table IA.IX of the Internet Appendix, we use 25% and 50% as the cutoff for the within-firm talent definition and continue to find that the most skilled employees are more likely to leave the firm as it approaches bankruptcy. The fact that the point estimates decrease as we make the talent definition more encompassing suggests that the probability that a worker "jumps ship" increases monotonically with cognitive and noncognitive skills. Although workers in the top 5% of the distribution of skills are about 65% more likely to leave firms approaching distress than their less-skilled colleagues, the magnitude is 42% for workers with above-median cognitive and noncognitive skills. In Table IA.X of the Internet Appendix, we define high-talent workers as those at the top of the skill distri-bution in the industry, or with reference to the economy-wide distribution of cognitive and noncognitive skill scores.When studying the evolution of the labor force composition, we defined hightalent employees as those whose combined cognitive and noncognitive skill scores belong to the top 5% of the distribution within the firm.

        <p>As our results are based on firms and workers in Sweden, external validity may be a concern. For example, Sweden's strong social safety nets, LIFO protections, and specific bankruptcy regulations could limit the applicability of our results to other settings. Strictly speaking, a study is only valid with respect to the setting it is analyzing. Just as the findings of a study in the United States (with its relatively weak social safety nets) might not be applicable elsewhere, the findings of our study could be limited to Europe (or Sweden, more specifically). However, we do not believe that this is the case. Like many other countries, Sweden is a market economy with a strong entrepreneurial culture.As our results are based on firms and workers in Sweden, external validity may be a concern.

        <p>Nevertheless, we try to address this concern not only qualitatively, but also by conducting an additional analysis using data from a different setting. In Section II of the Internet Appendix, we conduct a series of tests on the relationship between leverage and proxies for the mobility of highly skilled workers in the United States. In these tests, we exploit staggered changes in the enforceability of noncompete clauses in labor contracts across U.S. states as a natural experiment. We find that as the risk of talent loss is reduced due to increased enforceability of noncompete agreements by state courts, firms increase their financial leverage (see Klasa et al. (2018) for additional analysis of labor mobility and leverage). As in the Swedish setting, we find that these results are driven by financially unconstrained firms. This result is conceptually consistent with our more granular evidence based on Swedish data and suggests that our findings are not specific to the Swedish setting.Nevertheless, we try to address this concern not only qualitatively, but also by conducting an additional analysis using data from a different setting.

        <p>Modern corporations rely heavily on talent. In the new enterprise, human capital surpasses physical capital in its importance for value creation and as a source of competitive advantage (Rajan and Zingales (2000), Abowd et al. (2005)). However, the reliance on human capital and the high mobility of skilled labor-stemming from ample outside options in the labor marketalso expose firms to an added degree of fragility. In critical times, talent may leave the firm and seek employment elsewhere. This loss of talent in times of financial distress constitutes an additional source of risk that unlevered firms do not have to bear. Hence, firms that rely to a larger extent on talent face higher costs of financial distress and may therefore choose to operate with lower leverage.Modern corporations rely heavily on talent.

        <p>In this paper, we analyze the evolution of the labor force composition as firms approach bankruptcy. We document a decrease in the ability of firms to retain talent as they approach financial distress. To ensure that our findings are indeed driven by financial distress, we study a quasi-experiment that employs exogenous currency shocks in a sample of export-intensive firms with different capital structures. We find that following a large negative export shock, high-talent workers become more prone to leaving the firm, but only if the exporter experiencing the negative shock is highly leveraged. We interpret this as further evidence that our results are driven by financial and not economic distress.In this paper, we analyze the evolution of the labor force composition as firms approach bankruptcy.

        <p>We next study how this risk of losing highly skilled employees affects ex ante financial policies. To capture the subtle effects of talent on leverage, we study two dimensions of talent at the firm level: average skill and talent concentration. Our evidence suggests that both dimensions are relevant: both the average skill level in the organization and the degree to which skills are concentrated in a few key individuals within the firm are negatively associated with financial leverage.We next study how this risk of losing highly skilled employees affects ex ante financial policies.

First, we define a vector of the exposure of a firm to different currencies, Export exposure, for each firm f (the export exposure is fixed for each firm; it is calculated as the average of the first two years that a firm is in the sample). The elements of this vector contain the firm's exports denominated in EUR, USD, GBP, NOK, and DKK divided by the firm's sales (all in Swedish Krona) in the respective year:Export exposure f = ( Exports in EUR Total sales . . .

        <p>This variable captures the total number of years (starting in 1990 at the earliest) that an employee has worked in the current industry. To define the main industry of the employer, we proceed as follows. The industries are defined using SNI codes (the Swedish Standard Industrial classification). There have been four different classification standards for SNI: 1969, 1992, 2002, and 2007, which Serrano (which covers the period 1998 to 2011) combines into one SNI variable. Using this SNI variable, we define the following "coarse" industry categories: agriculture, manufacturing, transportation and utilities, construction and mining, commerce, professional services, other services, and finance. For the years 1990 to 1997 (no Serrano coverage), we proceed as follows. If a firm is in Serrano during the period 1998 to 2011, we use the coarse industry category of that firm from the 1998 to 2011 period. If a firm is not in Serrano between 1998 and 2011, we first obtain the SNI code from LISA and assign to it the most common coarse industry of the firms that are in Serrano between 1998 and 2011 and have the corresponding SNI code. For example, suppose that firm A is not in Serrano. In 1996, it has an SNI92 code of 36110, according to LISA. For SNI92 36110 in 1996, we consider the coarse industry of firms that are in Serrano between 1998 and 2011. Most of the firms with SNI92 36110 in 1996 that are later also in Serrano have "manufacturing" as their coarse industry, so we assign manufacturing as the coarse industry for firm A in 1996.This variable captures the total number of years (starting in 1990 at the earliest) that an employee has worked in the current industry.

        <p>One potential caveat in defining unemployment status using information from unemployment insurance payments is that if unemployment insurance take-up is low, we may falsely categorize workers as not having experienced an unemployment period even when they did. While this may be problematic in some countries (for example,Anderson and Meyer (1997) report that unemployment insurance take-up is below 50% in the United States), it is unlikely to bias our results in the Swedish setting. In Sweden, voluntary contributions to top-up governmental unemployment insurance are made by more than 85% of workers(Kolsrud et al. (2018)). Such contributions would not make financial sense if unemployment insurance take-up were low. Nevertheless, we cannot fully rule out the concern that unemployment insurance take-up may be lower for workers with high talent. We refer the reader toKolsrud et al. (2018) andLandais et al.
