        <p>This study analyses the impact of female directors and managers on sustainability performance in the banking industry. Drawing on prior studies, we attempt to frame gender diversity, its determinants, and its consequences with respect to financial, social, and environmental performance. Our sample includes 880 bank-year observations from 48 countries over the period 2011-2019. We conduct OLS and probit regressions on the panel data sample. The results show that increasing the proportion of female directors also improves the financial and environmental performance; female managers are keener on the social dimension and in engaging with stakeholders, than female directors. This study extends the current literature in the context of the banking industry, suggesting that banks should focus their efforts on establishing the right combination of female directors and managers. Furthermore, practical implications that encourage gender diversity among policy makers and regulators arise from this research.This study analyses the impact of female directors and managers on sustainability performance in the banking industry.

        <p>Gender equality is Goal 5 of the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development (United Nations, 2015). Although notable steps have been taken on the road to women's rights, full gender equality today is still an objective to be achieved, even more so during the pandemic scenario determined by COVID-19 (United Nations, 2020).Gender equality is Goal 5 of the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development (United Nations, 2015).

        <p>The crucial role of women in leadership has been shown even in times of crisis (Grandy et al., 2020). Indeed, during the Covid-19 pandemic, also in the financial industry, working conditions became tougher for women employees and women leaders. Women carry much more family responsibility than their male colleagues. This has been reflected in a late return to physical workplaces with respect to men (Calabrese et al., 2021). A recent study that investigated the role of women during the COVID-19 crisis, revealed that women are seen as more effective leaders with respect to their men colleagues. This, because women leaders can better interact as well as engage with their employees (Zenger &amp; Folkman, 2020).The crucial role of women in leadership has been shown even in times of crisis (Grandy et al., 2020).

        <p>In recent years, financial management scholars have focused on gender studies in the workplace, finding that women's skills, which are often overlooked and undercompensated, play a key role in firms' financial performance (Cabeza-García et al., 2017;Oware &amp; Mallikarjunappa, 2021;Reguera-Alvarado et al., 2017). In more detail, some authors have highlighted that gender diversity provides the top management with a better understanding of the complexities of the organizational environment and thus improves decision making (De Luis-Carnicer et al., 2008;Dwyer et al., 2003;Luanglath et al., 2019). As well as financial performance, gender diversity in the top management positively influences the social performance of firms (Campbell &amp; Mínguez-Vera, 2008;Hafsi &amp; Turgut, 2013;Veltri et al., 2021;Yasser et al., 2017). Prior studies have demonstrated that women in top management positions show a greater concern for social relationships, risk awareness, and stakeholder engagement (Amorelli &amp; García-Sánchez, 2020). Moreover, in the early 21st century, women have made major contributions to enhancing the environmental performance of firms and to broadening the research and policy debate on global environmental issues (Charumathi &amp; Rahman, 2019;Hossain et al., 2017).In recent years, financial management scholars have focused on gender studies in the workplace, finding that women's skills, which are often overlooked and undercompensated, play a key role in firms' financial performance (Cabeza-García et al., 2017;Oware &amp; Mallikarjunappa, 2021;Reguera-Alvarado et al., 2017).

        <p>Corporate governance studies focusing on banks have provided evidence on the relationship between the structure and the characteristics of the boards of directors and the performance of banks. Indeed, previous studies have shown how larger board size improve the effectiveness of monitoring and control activities, with the possibility of better assessing risk management choices (Adams &amp; Mehran, 2012;De Andrés &amp; Vallelado, 2008). More recently, other authors have investigated the presence of a relationship between banks' performance and the multiple factors that characterize corporate governance (Gallucci et al., 2020;Grove et al., 2011;Selvam et al., 2006).Corporate governance studies focusing on banks have provided evidence on the relationship between the structure and the characteristics of the boards of directors and the performance of banks.

        <p>Corporate governance scholars have pointed out the need to expand the presence of women in the top and middle management of companies. Hence, empirical evidences have shown that the diversification of corporate bodies generates advantages for the effectiveness of group decision-making mechanisms (Frias-Aceituno et al., 2013;Naciti et al., 2021;Valls Martinez et al., 2019). Indeed, gender diversity can contribute to avoiding dangerous cognitive biases as it favors decision-making mechanisms based on a plurality of views, freely expressed, in a participatory board debate (Frias-Aceituno et al., 2013;Galbreath, 2018).Corporate governance scholars have pointed out the need to expand the presence of women in the top and middle management of companies.

        <p>Accordingly, the topic of gender diversity is part of the debate on the complexity of corporate governance principles for banks (European Banking Authority-European Banking Authority (EBA), 2020a). Previous studies argued that gender diversity on board positively affects bank performance and greater bank stability (Cardillo et al., 2020;García-Meca et al., 2015;Owen &amp; Temesvary, 2018;Sahay et al., 2017). Conversely, Talavera et al. (2018) highlighted that a more heterogeneous board might consider different decisions because of the difference in directors' viewpoints, slowing down the decision process in the boardroom and leading to worse bank performance. The evolution of the banking environment requires governance to implement business models that are consistent with economic and management principles, but also compatible with social and environmental sustainability risks (European Banking Authority (EBA), 2019; EBA, 2020a; European Banking Authority (EBA), 2020b). In this view, the presence of women in the board provides a positive contribution to the effectiveness of governance, in which women supply the development of diversified approaches and usually tend to mitigate risks. Indeed, banks that have a presence of women in the board show on average lower risk profiles because linked to a prudent vision and more oriented towards the stability of the intermediary (De Cabo et al., 2012;García-Sánchez et al., 2015). Furthermore, the presence of women improves the bank's reputation ensuring homogeneous and non-discriminatory approaches to governance (Baselga-Pascual et al., 2018).Accordingly, the topic of gender diversity is part of the debate on the complexity of corporate governance principles for banks (European Banking Authority-European Banking Authority (EBA), 2020a).

        <p>Although the topic has gained increasing attention from banking authorities in recent years, there is a gap in the literature as scholars have devoted narrowed attention to the topic of gender diversity in the banking industry. In particular, to our knowledge, there are no studies that focused on the role of women on the board and that of women managers with regard to the three dimensions of performance. In the light of previous considerations, this work investigates how the presence of female directors and managers influences financial, social, and environmental performance. The methodology applied for the analysis is based on a multivariate panel data regression model.Although the topic has gained increasing attention from banking authorities in recent years, there is a gap in the literature as scholars have devoted narrowed attention to the topic of gender diversity in the banking industry.

        <p>In the research literature, the issue of gender diversity within boards of directors (BoDs) has been discussed in depth, and studies have adopted multiple theories to frame the topic. Among these, scholars have proposed the agency theory and the resource dependence theory (Davis &amp; Cobb, 2010;Shapiro, 2005;Ullah et al., 2020;Yoder, 1994).In the research literature, the issue of gender diversity within boards of directors (BoDs) has been discussed in depth, and studies have adopted multiple theories to frame the topic.

        <p>Following the assumption that managers have an opportunistic attitude and may have objectives that diverge from those of shareholders (agency theory; Jensen &amp; Meckling, 1976), the BoD plays the role of representation and safeguards the interests of the property to avoid the so-called agency costs. Against this background, several studies (Adams &amp; Ferreira, 2009;Moreno-G omez et al., 2018) have focused on the effects that a greater percentage of female directors has on business decisions, showing that female managers' monitoring provides greater protection of the interests of shareholders. This is due to the fact that different backgrounds bring various points of view to the decision-making process (Valls Martinez et al., 2019). Moreover, a recent study has shown that a heterogeneous board performs control and monitoring activities better given that different backgrounds, ages, genders, nationalities, and cultures offer multiple points of view (Pucheta-Martínez &amp; Gallego-Alvarez, 2020).Following the assumption that managers have an opportunistic attitude and may have objectives that diverge from those of shareholders (agency theory; Jensen &amp; Meckling, 1976), the BoD plays the role of representation and safeguards the interests of the property to avoid the so-called agency costs.

        <p>According to the resource dependence theory (RDT; Pfeffer &amp; Salancik, 1978), organizations seek to reduce external uncertainty to ensure the availability of resources for their survival and development (Hillman et al., 2009). The presence of diversity among the members of the BoD allows for a greater number of interconnections with the market and with competitors, which translates into a source of new capital as well as a higher quality of resources and information (Cordeiro et al., 2020). In this sense, previous studies have agreed that women have better networking characteristics than men and help the company to secure these resources (Bear et al., 2010;Nadeem et al., 2019). Another significant function of the BoD, reinterpreted by the resource theory, concerns the legitimacy of the company in the eyes of the community. Accordingly, the representation of minorities on the board leads to greater approval by citizens, especially regarding gender diversity, given that the lack of women's representation on boards means a potential loss of human capital.According to the resource dependence theory (RDT; Pfeffer &amp; Salancik, 1978), organizations seek to reduce external uncertainty to ensure the availability of resources for their survival and development (Hillman et al., 2009).

        <p>As regards the top management team (TMT) diversity, Dezsö and Ross (2012), analyzing a sample of 1500 companies over a period of 15 years, show that the presence of women in top management increases the performance of management (both Top and Middle) and thus the performance of enterprise. Women do, in fact, contribute to management teams by bringing a diversity of life experiences and providing extra insights into some strategic issues, particularly those involving female clients, collaborators, or business partners.As regards the top management team (TMT) diversity, Dezsö and Ross (2012), analyzing a sample of 1500 companies over a period of 15 years, show that the presence of women in top management increases the performance of management (both Top and Middle) and thus the performance of enterprise.

        <p>In general, more diverse groups can benefit from different points of view, consider a broader range of possible solutions, and debate others' points of view more vigorously, resulting in higher-quality decisions, especially when the task requires analyzing and processing a large amount of data, as it does with TMT decisions. Furthermore, the good influence of female presence in TMT, is not confined to the performance of the management team, but also involves other levels of the organization. Indeed, there are times in a person's career when mentoring and other supportive relationships are critical, and because these social relationships are strongly influenced by similarities in certain social factors (i.e., gender), the lack of women in top management positions can be a barrier to women's career advancement.In general, more diverse groups can benefit from different points of view, consider a broader range of possible solutions, and debate others' points of view more vigorously, resulting in higher-quality decisions, especially when the task requires analyzing and processing a large amount of data, as it does with TMT decisions.

        <p>Many scholars have found a positive relationship, others a negative one, and still others no relationship. Carter et al. (2003), considering a sample of 638 American companies, found a positive relationship between the presence of women and the market value of the companies measured using Tobin's Q. Similarly, the empirical studies conducted by Christiansen et al. (2016), Darko et al. (2016), Erhardt et al. (2003), and Smith et al. (2006) observed that companies with women on their board showed positive results in their financial and economic performance, such as the ROA and ROE.Many scholars have found a positive relationship, others a negative one, and still others no relationship.

        <p>Other studies observed how the increase in the percentage of female directors has arisen by specific regulations that have required companies to have a minimum number of women on the board (Joecks et al., 2013;Khan, Khan, &amp; Saeed, 201). On the other hand, further studies on female staff have focused on specific professional or training skills and the way in which these provide added value to cover roles within the boards (Christiansen et al., 2016;Ongore et al., 2015).

        <p>They also looked at the effects of women's esteem and employeeelected board members in the article, and they employed innovative boardroom talks as a mediating variable. The study's major takeaway is that it's more vital to question how, rather than if, women and employee-elected board members contribute, and that we need to crack open the black box of actual board conduct to see how they do so.They also looked at the effects of women's esteem and employeeelected board members in the article, and they employed innovative boardroom talks as a mediating variable.

Their findings demonstrate that women's access to corporate boards appears to be scattered in research silos from a variety of fields, with no cohesive vision that provides tools to overcome the constraints that prevent women from serving on corporate boards.Moreover, Gabaldon et al.

        <p>Conversely, other studies, such as those by Adams and Ferreira (2009) and Shrader et al.

        <p>In The study made a comparison between public sector banks and private sector banks, and the results indicate that the former can implement the best corporate governance practices. In this case, many governance factors were considered, and the results show that some governance profiles, such as the presence of committees or women on the board of directors, are significant with respect to the performance of banks. Gallucci et al. (2020) demonstrated the existence of a link between women on the board and banks' risk taking, arguing that the moderating role of masculinity at the country level negatively influences board diversity and intensifies women's risk aversion. From various reports (Owen &amp; Temesvary, 2018;Strøm et al., 2014), it is possible to understand that women could reach top positions in a shorter time frame, improving the workplace environment and consequently the company performance (García-Meca et al., 2015).In The study made a comparison between public sector banks and private sector banks, and the results indicate that the former can implement the best corporate governance practices.

        <p>Defining CSP, Wood (1991) underlines the importance of the principles of social responsibility and interrelation between the individuals that operate in the company as drivers for the achievement of performance and social impacts deriving from the business programs and policies (Esposito et al., 2021). In this perspective, Boulouta's (2013) empirical analysis, based on a sample of 126 American companies over a 5-year period, suggested that board gender diversity significantly influences CSP. The author stated that, within boards of directors, women tend to care for social issues more than men, and this exerts positive effects on corporate performance. Furthermore, she argued that one of the distinctive traits of the female stereotype is looking after social, economic, or environmental aspects, meaning that the company's commitment to these issues is recognized through positive impacts on social performance.Defining CSP, Wood (1991) underlines the importance of the principles of social responsibility and interrelation between the individuals that operate in the company as drivers for the achievement of performance and social impacts deriving from the business programs and policies (Esposito et al., 2021).

        <p>The choice of the dependent variables came from the willingness to investigate the financial, social, and environmental dimensions of corporate performance in banks. Improving financial performance is not the only objective of banks; indeed, to attract more investors, financial institutions must enhance the other performance dimensions that can affect investors' decisions and stakeholders' needs, developing a competitive advantage to be socially beneficial (Galletta, Mazzù, &amp; Naciti, 2021;García-Sánchez et al., 2020).The choice of the dependent variables came from the willingness to investigate the financial, social, and environmental dimensions of corporate performance in banks.

        <p>With the aim of testing our first set of hypotheses, we use the ROA as a financial performance indicator, measuring banks' ability to generate returns on their assets. To test our second set of hypotheses, we use stakeholder engagement as a proxy for the dependent variable indicating social performance (SOCIAL_PERF). It is computed as a dummy variable that equals one if a bank conveys qualitative information on how it engages with its stakeholders and zero otherwise (B atae et al., 2021). The information provided on stakeholder engagement relates to how the company is involving the stakeholders in its decision-making process and what procedures are in place for engagement (Refinitiv Eikon, 2020). Indeed, banks share the values and the guiding principles on which their conduct and decisions are based and are willing to undertake initiatives that testify to their strong commitment to supporting their values in the light of engaging with stakeholders. Stakeholder engagement can be understood as a sequence of activities that an organization implements to involve stakeholders in its decision-making processes in a positive way.With the aim of testing our first set of hypotheses, we use the ROA as a financial performance indicator, measuring banks' ability to generate returns on their assets.

        <p>Along with other polluting industries, financial institutions are involved in environmental responsibility (Gallego-Alvarez &amp; Pucheta-Martínez, 2019;Galletta, Mazzù, &amp; Naciti, 2021). Therefore, with the purpose of testing our third set of hypotheses, we employ policy emission reduction as a proxy for the dependent variable, which indicates environmental performance (ENV_PERF). It is determined by considering a dummy variable equals one if a bank has a policy to reduce its emissions and zero otherwise. In addition, emission policies refer to the processes, mechanisms, or programs that a bank has put in place to reduce its emissions in its operations. Moreover, information regarding emission policies pertains to the possibility of a bank adopting a system or a set of formal, documented processes for controlling emissions and driving continuous improvement.Along with other polluting industries, financial institutions are involved in environmental responsibility (Gallego-Alvarez &amp; Pucheta-Martínez, 2019;Galletta, Mazzù, &amp; Naciti, 2021).

        <p>To test the hypotheses, we run separate OLS regressions for both types of female leaders in the workplace (Table 4). Model 1 displays the regression results with both the independent variables, and the main results show that women on the board contribute to increased financial performance, supporting Hypothesis 1. Moreover, to mitigate the concern about persistence and the correlation of past and future values of error terms, we use dynamic panel estimation with lagged independent variables (L.W_BOD, L. W_MANAG). Model 2 presents the outcomes, including the lagged regressor of female directors (L.W_BOD), which shows a positive and statistically significant coefficient together with W_BOD at time t. Thus, considering its lagged regressor, we find that the presence of women on the board of directors has a persistent effect. Model 3 (Table 4) includes the lagged regressor of W_MANAG, which presents a negative and significant sign. However, no evidence supports Hypothesis 1b concerning female managers' effects on financial performance.

        <p>To support the findings reported in the previous section further, we conduct several robustness checks. First, we replace the dependent variable ROA with its natural logarithm, which has already been employed as the dependent variable in previous literature on the banking sector (Buallay et al., 2020). The use of the logarithm is also intended to normalize its density function, proving that the dependent variable shows high persistence. Second, the results reported in the previous sections might be biased by several methodological limitations. In particular, endogeneity is the major concern about selection bias and reverse causality between the variables chosen. As before, to address this issue, we add the independent variables lagged with respect to the natural logarithm of the ROA to check the effect of the previous year of the gender diversity policy in our sample of banks (Table 6, Models 3-5).

        <p>As a further robustness test, we include the squared term of the independent variable representing female directors on the board as an explanatory variable to allow for a curvilinear relationship. Table 6 (Models 1 and 2) presents the regression model outcomes with the quadratic terms of the independent variable, W_BOD. Adding the quadratic term of female directors confirms that the relationship between the independent variable and the financial performance is nonlinear. Indeed, the quadratic term of women on the BoD (W_BOD) shows a U-shaped relationship (Table 6, Model 2), supporting a positive effect on the ROA.

Indeed, disseminating the information that stakeholders expect to receive is a way to ensure greater transparency and obtain social legitimacy (Knox-</p>

        <p>Finally, the robustness tests performed, employing other dependent variables (log ROA and CSR reporting), confirm the previous outcomes that banks benefit from female directors and managers in terms of financial, social, and environmental performance, respectively. Moreover, we added lagged regressors to control for the endogeneity issue and checked for a curvilinear relationship of female directors by adding a quadratic term to the regression analysis. Since our analyses show that there are potential benefits from having more women in leadership positions, the results have implications for policy makers, encouraging gender diversity, as well as for regulators (Cosma et al., 2021).Finally, the robustness tests performed, employing other dependent variables (log ROA and CSR reporting), confirm the previous outcomes that banks benefit from female directors and managers in terms of financial, social, and environmental performance, respectively.

        <p>What emerges from our study is that, on the one hand, banks with female directors are proving to the market their oversight ability to adapt to the rapidly developing regulatory environment by mitigating climate risks. Conversely, at the management level, there is still a need to implement more formal climate change policies and governance programs, which require greater attention from female managers.What emerges from our study is that, on the one hand, banks with female directors are proving to the market their oversight ability to adapt to the rapidly developing regulatory environment by mitigating climate risks.

        <p>In our study, we explored the relationship between gender diversity and bank performance, considering the financial, social, and environmental dimensions. Specifically, we examined the effects of the female proportion of the top and middle management in a sample of worldwide banks after the financial crisis, from 2011 to 2019. While the topic has been the subject of much debate, there is a gap in the literature regarding gender diversity in the banking industry; thus, we Second, in line with the agency theory, the results show that a larger proportion of female directors affects financial performance.In our study, we explored the relationship between gender diversity and bank performance, considering the financial, social, and environmental dimensions.

        <p>Indeed, the agency theoretical view suggests that the role of the BoD, with its active monitoring and controlling, is an important driver to moderate agency problems. These have been found to be widespread practices when the board gender diversity increases.Indeed, the agency theoretical view suggests that the role of the BoD, with its active monitoring and controlling, is an important driver to moderate agency problems.

        <p>Third, the evidence that TMT gender diversity has good benefits on social performance suggests that financial institutions should work on improving gender diversity in their TMTs, even if, based on our study, they do not have a significant effect on financial performance.Third, the evidence that TMT gender diversity has good benefits on social performance suggests that financial institutions should work on improving gender diversity in their TMTs, even if, based on our study, they do not have a significant effect on financial performance.</p>
        <p>Indeed, based on the social justice for gender diversity and its impact on corporate social performance, they should continue to strive for a stronger representation of women in top management (Byron &amp; Post, 2016). European Central Bank-European Central Bank, 2020). With reference to women in top management, banks will benefit through the direct effect of the proportion of female managers on social performance. This is an important finding as it suggests that women make a contribution in terms of the diversity of life experiences in management teams with respect to stakeholder demands. Indeed, the relationships between ethics and business are an essential issue: the stakeholder approach requires more since it claims to be founded on the idea of an intrinsic, close, and synergistic connection between ethics and business (Addabbo et al., 2020;Moore, 2001).Indeed, based on the social justice for gender diversity and its impact on corporate social performance, they should continue to strive for a stronger representation of women in top management (Byron &amp; Post, 2016).

        <p>Nevertheless, this study suffers from some limitations which can be seen as future research. First, the sample includes banks from different countries, which differ in their regulation and the government policies aimed at addressing gender equality issues. In this respect, future research could be oriented towards analyzing the impact of gender diversity in organizations belonging to countries that are implementing the goals of the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development. Secondly, in this study, variables such as age, culture, nationality, education and which could indirectly influence the direct relationship between the percentage of women and the performance of banks were not included. In this sense, future research could investigate the moderating effect of the variables mentioned.Nevertheless, this study suffers from some limitations which can be seen as future research.
