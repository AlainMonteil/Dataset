        <p>The growing importance of humanitarian operations has created an imperative to overcome the complications currently recorded in the field. Challenges such as delays, congestion, poor communication and lack of accountability may represent opportunities to test the reported advantages of emergent disruptive technologies.The growing importance of humanitarian operations has created an imperative to overcome the complications currently recorded in the field. Challenges such as delays, congestion, poor communication and lack of accountability may represent opportunities to test the reported advantages of emergent disruptive technologies.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the literature on humanitarian supply chains looks at isolated applications of technology and lacks a framework for understanding challenges and solutions, a gap that this article aims to fill. Using a case study based on the flood of Tabasco of 2007 in Mexico, this research identifies solutions based on the use of emergent disruptive technologies. Furthermore, this article argues that the integration of different technologies is essential to deliver real benefits to the humanitarian supply chain. As a result, it proposes a framework to improve the flow of information, products and financial resources in humanitarian supply chains integrating three emergent disruptive technologies; Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain and 3D Printing. The analysis presented shows the potential of the framework to reduce congestion in the supply chain, enhance simultaneous collaboration of different stakeholders, decrease lead times, increase transparency, traceability and accountability of material and financial resources, and allow victims to get involved in the fulfilment of their own needs.Meanwhile, the literature on humanitarian supply chains looks at isolated applications of technology and lacks a framework for understanding challenges and solutions, a gap that this article aims to fill.

        <p>Humanitarian logistics looks at the mobilisation and management of resources (human and material) to provide support for disaster victims in uncertain conditions (Van Wassenhove 2006;Manopiniwes and Irohara 2017;Sahin, Narayanan, and Robinson 2013). The dispatch of commodities such as food, water, medicines, cleaning kits, and tents is essential to ensure the survival of the victims. However, damaged infrastructure, multiple participants, uncertain conditions, and the dynamic variation of needs hinder the provision of them. For instance, Lee and Marc (2003) argue that current disaster management systems are affected by; duplication of efforts for data input, multiple formats, lack of control of budgets, absence of accountability, lack of integrity in procurement procedures, absence of a central database, and manual reporting and tracking. These challenges engender limited coordination among multiple stakeholders, supply shortages, lack of records, and poor information management (Schultz and Søreide 2008;Whybark et al. 2010). The flood of Tabasco in 2007 represents a good example of these problems, which were amplified by the unprecedented scale of the disaster. With the advent of Industry 4.0, there is an opportunity to investigate technological applications to improve disaster management. This paper argues that an integrated combination of emergent disruptive technologies (EDTs) can augment, trace and implement decisions capable of helping to overcome these conditions.

        <p>The purpose of HSCs is to obtain the required resources, transport them to the affected region, and deliver them to the victims. Humanitarian distribution channels present the flow of in-kind relief reaching the affected areas, flow of information and data for order transmission and control, and unilateral flow of money from donors to organisations (Charles et al. 2016). These three flows are essential for any supply chain and are defined as logistics, information and financial flows (Wang, Jia, et al. 2019). Error! Reference source not found. depicts these flows in a typical HSC, beginning with financial and logistics flows from individual donors until the resources are transported to reach the beneficiaries. At the same time, information is generated at demand areas and transmitted to the stakeholders, which include donors. Traditionally, the information has been filtered by decision-makers and disseminated through mass communication channels. That dynamic is changing with the advent of social media, which is eliminating intermediaries in information management and allowing information through varied information channels.The purpose of HSCs is to obtain the required resources, transport them to the affected region, and deliver them to the victims.

        <p>Lead time delays, shortage of commodities and excess of low-priority products are common during disasters because of damaged transportation infrastructure and demand uncertainty (Sahin, Narayanan, and Robinson 2013). Delays are caused by poor planning, limited availability of vehicles and conditions of the disaster, whereas shortages of relief occur mostly because of limited availability of information, poor needs assessment and deficient supplier management. In other cases, however, the large number of participants can lead to the convergence of significant amounts of relief causing congestion (Holguín-Veras et al. 2014). Facilities and human resources in countries stricken by disaster can be overwhelmed by large amounts of relief.Lead time delays, shortage of commodities and excess of low-priority products are common during disasters because of damaged transportation infrastructure and demand uncertainty (Sahin, Narayanan, and Robinson 2013).

        <p>Congestion is worsened by the delivery of low-priority items among urgent relief. This creates the need to sort and manage undesired relief (Kovács and Spens 2007), which causes bottlenecks in the supply chain.Congestion is worsened by the delivery of low-priority items among urgent relief.

        <p>There are articles addressing these challenges by introducing formulations accounting for uncertainty in transportation, minimising time, introducing prepositioning policies for immediate deployment, and allocating human and material resources (Song, Chen, and Lei 2018;Sharifyazdi et al. 2018;Rodríguez-Espíndola, Albores, and Brewster 2018b). However, most of these articles do not look at the whole HSC nor the effect of donor independence (Whybark et al. 2010). From the HSC standpoint, Oloruntoba and Gray (2006) argue for the use of effective demand-led inventory management using postponement to allow quick responsiveness while maintaining lower costs. Saputra et al. (2015) explore the trade-off between transport modes and end-of-shelf-life policies for medicine prepositioning in cases of disaster.There are articles addressing these challenges by introducing formulations accounting for uncertainty in transportation, minimising time, introducing prepositioning policies for immediate deployment, and allocating human and material resources (Song, Chen, and Lei 2018;Sharifyazdi et al. 2018;Rodríguez-Espíndola, Albores, and Brewster 2018b).

        <p>Disaster situations create an environment lacking communication infrastructure, standardisation, and reliable information. Hence, coordination has been identified as a major challenge. The absence of coordination can cause oversupply of resources or competition for the same resources, as exemplified by the "truck crisis" that took place on Haiti in 2010, in which the scarcity of trucks prevented the delivery of ready-to-go relief. This happened because of poor coordination among stakeholders resulting from lack of information sharing and meagre communication (Dwivedi et al. 2018).Disaster situations create an environment lacking communication infrastructure, standardisation, and reliable information.

        <p>To support disaster operations under conditions of limited information, authors have provided formulations to manage that environment using fuzzy approaches, stochastic programming, robust optimisation, network-based approaches, and hybrid approaches with optimisation (Baryannis et al. 2019) Nevertheless, the impact of unreliable information has led researchers to look for more reactive solutions for HSCs.To support disaster operations under conditions of limited information, authors have provided formulations to manage that environment using fuzzy approaches, stochastic programming, robust optimisation, network-based approaches, and hybrid approaches with optimisation (Baryannis et al. 2019) Nevertheless, the impact of unreliable information has led researchers to look for more reactive solutions for HSCs.</p>
        <p>A popular argument has been the need for agility, which allows to react to changing conditions swiftly (Oloruntoba and Gray 2006;Rasouli 2018).

        <p>Disasters cause a significant flow of money towards the affected area. At times of crisis, the management of financial funds has a steep impact on the victims. Previous experience, however, has shown several shortcomings. The visibility of financial funds is often poor in these settings (Schultz and Søreide 2008). Despite the importance of procuring and tracking items during disaster response (Lee and Marc 2003), studies have identified corruption in procurement, diversion of resources, and lack of accountability stemming from the management of financial flows (Schultz and Søreide 2008). This is a problem for the aid-receivers in three ways: the resources that are not used for the intended purpose, the diminished trust from the donors, and potential bias leading to inconsistent coverage (Lentz et al. 2013).Disasters cause a significant flow of money towards the affected area.

        <p>An alternative to decentralise procurement practices has been to make the resources directly reach customers in the form of cash vouchers. Cash vouchers are coupons that can be used as money and exchanged for goods and services and are becoming an attractive alternative because these can reduce lead times and support local procurement (Lentz et al. 2013). Nevertheless, control of these cash vouchers suffers from the same challenges in terms of traceability and potential bias.An alternative to decentralise procurement practices has been to make the resources directly reach customers in the form of cash vouchers.

        <p>Recent experiences show challenges in the flow of relief, information and financial resources during disaster situations (Santos-Reyes, Alvarado-Corona, and Olmos-Peña 2010). The HSC requires reduced lead-times for relief delivery, improved coordination and communication, reliable accountability and transparency, real-time information, and agile practices. There are interesting proposals to achieve these, but most of them are isolated strategies to improve certain shortcomings in HSCs. There is a need to look at the whole supply chain and the three flows presented to identify the most beneficial approaches to enhance HSCs (Wang, Jia, et al. 2019). This paper argues that the integration of different EDTs can be a valuable alternative to augment, trace and implement decisions.Recent experiences show challenges in the flow of relief, information and financial resources during disaster situations (Santos-Reyes, Alvarado-Corona, and Olmos-Peña 2010).

        <p>A global review of disaster initiatives of the UN highlighted that the use of information, technology and applied research can be essential to tackle disaster risk reduction (Schryen and Wex 2014). Hence, different efforts have been undertaken to use information and technology in disasters. For instance, there are analysis using cooperative games to gather insights about the drivers for successful coordination (Ergun et al. 2014), ERP systems and tracking systems for humanitarian purposes (Comes 2016), RFID technology for tracking in relief distribution (Wu and Lirn 2011) and barcoded ID cards for delivery of items (Ergun et al. 2014) More recently, technologies linked to Industry 4.0 have been seen as a potential solution to the challenges faced by HSCs. Cichosz (2018) lists 8 technologies that will be increasingly used in the forthcoming years, including; Self-Driving Vehicles (SDV), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Artificial Intelligence (AI), 3D Printing (3DP), Blockchain (BC), Next-Generation Wireless (NGW), Bionic Enhancement (BE), and Virtual Reality (VR).A global review of disaster initiatives of the UN highlighted that the use of information, technology and applied research can be essential to tackle disaster risk reduction (Schryen and Wex 2014).

        <p>Damages in infrastructure and chaotic conditions in the roads have led to a lack of articles focused on SDV. Nevertheless, the need to reach the affected areas during disaster management despite these challenges has pointed at alternative vehicles, such as UAVs. There are articles looking at providing disaster assessment (Oruc and Kara 2018), developing emergency communication systems (Tuna, Nefzi, and Conte 2014), supporting search and rescue operations (Beck et al. 2018), and enhancing distribution (Chowdhury et al. 2017). Alternatively, an option to avoid having to transport commodities at all is through on-site production. Labonnote et al. (2016) suggest the use of 3DP for the construction of temporal shelters because of its capability to produce products of almost any shape (Gardan 2016). Tatham, Loy, and Peretti (2015) look at the advantages of 3DP for humanitarian logistics focusing on the ability of fused deposition modelling (FDM) to produce parts for repairing water, sanitation and hygiene equipment. More recently, Savonen et al. (2018) propose the design of a portable 3D printer for humanitarian operations using a variant of FDM.Damages in infrastructure and chaotic conditions in the roads have led to a lack of articles focused on SDV.

        <p>NGW has been proposed for the development of new public safety communication networks (Sohul et al. 2016) and the combination of wireless with IoT to manage multiple sensors for data delivery (Al-Turjman 2019). On the other hand, BC is an enabling technology recently analysed in the context of logistics (Winkelhaus and Grosse 2019). The U.S. government explore its use to create a decentralised system through improved information sharing to exploit its traceability, transparency and immutability (Akilo 2018), and there has been an appearance of blockchain-based charity sites such as Binance and BitShares for disaster donations (Wolfson 2018). BE has not been analysed from the perspective of HSCs, but VR has been suggested for preparedness to train disaster professionals (Farra, Miller, and Hodgson 2015), to visualise disaster scenes (Ya et al. 2018), to create disaster awareness (Suarez 2017), and to prepare disaster evacuations (Danial et al. 2019).NGW has been proposed for the development of new public safety communication networks (Sohul et al. 2016) and the combination of wireless with IoT to manage multiple sensors for data delivery (Al-Turjman 2019).

        <p>AI has been a prominent technology to augment decision-making. For instance, articles in the literature have focused on identifying disaster risk (Chen et al. 2013), predicting flood routing (Bagatur and Onen 2018), improving situational awareness using big data (Khare, Burel, and Alani 2019), and using big data to detect socioeconomic recovery (Shibuya and Tanaka 2019) and resilience (Papadopoulos et al. 2017). Specifically looking at logistics activities, there have been contributions to enhance evacuation by analysing human behaviour (Kurdi et al. 2018), to create expert systems to simulate instances to develop operational strategies (Dong et al. 2013), and to implement agent-base techniques to manage disruptions in the supply chain (Blos, da Silva, and Wee 2018). AI also has potential to be complemented with other technologies. For instance, Tang and Wen (2009) joined AI with GIS to inform decision-making for infrastructure management during earthquakes.AI has been a prominent technology to augment decision-making.

        <p>Technology has been a major enabler for commercial operations management over time (Gershwin 2018). Winkelhaus and Grosse (2019) classified the technological building blocks into three categories; information generation, information handling and information usage. The first concept refers to gathering information to enhance visibility of the system, whereas information handling refers to managing the data and analysing it, and information usage means planning tasks, executing tasks and providing services (Winkelhaus and Grosse 2019). Different articles have studied information generation in disaster management (Alexander 2013;Lin et al. 2016;Wu and Lirn 2011).

        <p>Among the EDTs, the lack of studies looking at BE and SDV in humanitarian logistics constraints their use. VR has been associated with training and disaster awareness, but it is more related to pre-emptive activities than the HSC at the response stage. NGW has significant value to set-up communications, but its application in relief distribution has been envisioned more as infrastructure. UAVs are an interesting alternative for relief distribution, but limitations in payload, scalability, coordination, safety and energy efficiency can limit their application (Floreano and Wood 2015;Chowdhury et al. 2017). AI, BC and 3DP are among the most representative technologies shaping future developments in operations management (Xu, Xu, and Li 2018) and they represent suitable technologies for data handling and usage (Winkelhaus and Grosse 2019). In fact, AI as well as 3DP have been successfully combined with BC before (Dinh and Thai 2018;Mandolla et al. 2019). Therefore, this article is focusing on the role of AI, BC and 3DP in the HSC. This article argues that the combination of these three EDTs can improve the logistics flow in the physical world at the same time as it improves processes in the virtual world for HSCs.Among the EDTs, the lack of studies looking at BE and SDV in humanitarian logistics constraints their use.

In fact, AI as well as 3DP have been successfully combined with BC before (Dinh and Thai 2018;Mandolla et al. 2019). Therefore, this article is focusing on the role of AI, BC and 3DP in the HSC. This article argues that the combination of these three EDTs can improve the logistics flow in the physical world at the same time as it improves processes in the virtual world for HSCs.</p>
        <p>AI involves determining a specific information management problem, introducing a computational formulation for it, and creating an algorithm to implement it (Marr 1977). Artificial intelligence is increasingly being utilized to make data-driven business decisions in various business and social contexts because it facilitates knowledge discovery to formulate recommendations and deep insights by employing intelligent algorithms to process (O'Leary 2013). Unlike traditional statistical and operational research techniques, it has the ability to learn from existing data and adapt with the new incoming stream of data (Kaplan and Haenlein 2019).AI involves determining a specific information management problem, introducing a computational formulation for it, and creating an algorithm to implement it (Marr 1977).

        <p>Employing AI-based techniques will result in: (1) reducing the information and cognitive overload posed by the huge volumes of data generated from multiple streams at any given point, i.e. automatically aggregate, process and summarise the data, thus turning it into useful information for the decision-makers; (2) reducing aggregating latency, i.e. ability to automatically aggregate historical data with new incoming data streams that will facilitate both learning from historical information and adapting outputs (recommendations) considering the newly captured information (Deparday 2019); (3) reducing analysis latency, i.e. transforming the data into usable information that will aid to quickly explore the data visually and identify interesting trends and patterns within this digital asset; (4) reducing decision latency, i.e. augmenting human decision-making supported through automated recommendations generated by employing AI techniques considering all data streams in a timely manner, which is extremely significant in the case of crisis, disaster and safety critical systems (Radianti et al. 2019).Employing AI-based techniques will result in: (1) reducing the information and cognitive overload posed by the huge volumes of data generated from multiple streams at any given point, i.e. automatically aggregate, process and summarise the data, thus turning it into useful information for the decision-makers; (2) reducing aggregating latency, i.e. ability to automatically aggregate historical data with new incoming data streams that will facilitate both learning from historical information and adapting outputs (recommendations) considering the newly captured information (Deparday 2019); (3) reducing analysis latency, i.e. transforming the data into usable information that will aid to quickly explore the data visually and identify interesting trends and patterns within this digital asset; (4) reducing decision latency, i.e. augmenting human decision-making supported through automated recommendations generated by employing AI techniques considering all data streams in a timely manner, which is extremely significant in the case of crisis, disaster and safety critical systems (Radianti et al. 2019).</p>
        <p>There are a range of potential applications of AI in the supply chain. The advantages of this technology allow the design of decision-support systems for performing supplier selection, introducing agility in the HSCs, mining patterns in big data for risk identification, managing information from multiple sources, among others (Baryannis et al. 2019). Moreover, the capabilities of AI make it ideal to combine with other techniques and technologies to develop hybrid systems to augment decisions (Baryannis et al. 2019;Dinh and Thai 2018).There are a range of potential applications of AI in the supply chain.

        <p>BC is an electronic ledger, which relevant users can view but cannot manipulate. It can record transactions in a secure, transparent, decentralized, efficient, and low-cost way (Schatsky and Muraskin 2015). BC can simplify the transmission of information to eliminate commonly conflicting layers. Information thus is more reliable, accurate, timely, highly visible and incorruptible. Having "better" information can enhance collaboration and coordination, because it can enable the implementation of decentralised systems. The key properties of this technology that makes it a valuable proposition to handle transactions are discussed below.BC is an electronic ledger, which relevant users can view but cannot manipulate.

BC technology will help to increase the trust among all the stakeholders involved in the financial flow and it will decrease the processing lead times, which is essential for HSCs. Additionally, analytics employed over the information stored in the blocks has the potential to better understand cash flows, which in turn will make the economic resource allocation efficient (Huckle et al. 2016).(6) Self-reviewing: The blockchain will automatically update after each transaction and record the information, which will ensure that every node (participating entity in the network) will store an up-to-date copy of the ledger.

        <p>One of the potential applications of BC is in smart contracts. BC Smart contracts are self-executing software programs encoding contractual agreements usually in the form of mathematical rules in the BC network (Saberi et al. 2018). The self-execution will depend upon the operations (actions) of the participating entities, which are the input variables to smart contract algorithm. This eliminates the reliance on the intermediaries to seek approval and thus will aid in decreasing the contract processing time. The self-executing programs in the smart contracts will help to trace and track the distribution either by collecting relevant data from sensors (IoT enabled devices) or input from organisations (Huckle et al. 2016).One of the potential applications of BC is in smart contracts.

        <p>3DP technologies vary, but share two common characteristics: 1) They build parts in layers of material, for example metal powders that are melted by laser or liquid polymers cured with ultraviolet light. This enables complex shapes to be created, removing traditional constraints on geometry, as well as removing cost penalties traditionally associated with low volume production (Candi and Beltagui 2018;Petrovic et al. 2011).3DP technologies vary, but share two common characteristics: 1) They build parts in layers of material, for example metal powders that are melted by laser or liquid polymers cured with ultraviolet light.

        <p>While unit costs and energy consumption may be higher than mass production, 3DP makes it feasible and economical to produce small batches, of parts, where and when required (Weller, Kleer, and Piller 2015;Baumers and Holweg 2019).

        <p>Supply chain research has examined a number of applications for 3DP in complex industrial contexts as well as for facilitating customer involvement. Khajavi, Partanen, and Holmström (2014) model configurations for spare parts supply chains, demonstrating the responsiveness and agility benefits from distributed 3DP compared to centralised production and transportation. Meanwhile, Beltagui, Kunz, and Gold (2019) modelled the benefits to a mobile phone company's market penetration that result from opening the design and production of accessories to customers. These studies show the advantages and potential of 3DP to be used in activities such as infrastructure repairs and production of accessories on-site, which can be highly valuable for HSCs.Supply chain research has examined a number of applications for 3DP in complex industrial contexts as well as for facilitating customer involvement.

        <p>The articles reviewed in this section show that applications of EDTs in humanitarian logistics are usually isolated and still at their infancy. Despite the advances on technology, managers are still struggling to manage the financial, logistics and information flows presented in HSCs. This is partly because many advances and technologies have not been properly transferred to users in the humanitarian field, but also because the benefits from the integration of different technologies addressing the combination of three flows are currently under-investigated. It is important to look at the three flows and their integration to develop supply chain capabilities (Wang, Jia, et al. 2019). AI, BC and 3DP have been associated with humanitarian operations before as isolated solutions, but never looking at the whole HSC. Furthermore, the integration of these three technologies has not be hinted in the literature before as a potential solution to the complications to the smooth flow of information, products and money in disaster situations. This article addresses that gap by providing an analysis of a real case study looking at the use of EDTs in the context of humanitarian logistics and proposing a conceptual framework to improve HSCs.The articles reviewed in this section show that applications of EDTs in humanitarian logistics are usually isolated and still at their infancy.

        <p>The purpose of this paper is to analyse the role of technology in the HSC to propose a framework to improve operations. EDTs such as 3DP, BC and AI have a lot of potential to be implemented in different fields (Xu, Xu, and Li 2018). Nevertheless, several of these applications and their implications are yet to be investigated. Given the potential of case research to generate, test or elaborate on theory (Ketokivi and Choi 2014), and its value to look at instances which have been scarcely investigated before (Voss, Tsikriktsis, and Frohlich 2002), this paper uses a case study to analyse the prospective role of EDTs in disasters.The purpose of this paper is to analyse the role of technology in the HSC to propose a framework to improve operations.

        <p>Three types of case studies can be carried out for research purposes: exploratory, descriptive and explanatory (Yin 1981). This article is presenting an exploratory study (Yin 2018) to show the challenges faced in disaster management and the capabilities of the technologies discussed to provide solutions. An exploratory case study is suitable for this because it allows to understand dynamics existent in a defined context (Eisenhardt 1989;Burnard and Bhamra 2011). In that sense, the case presented in this article is used to analyse current issues in disaster management in Mexico to identify the value of different technologies to improve the HSC. Through a review of extant literature about technologies used in disaster situations, the case study is used to analyse potential applications of 3DP, AI and BC to improve the financial, logistics and information flow in disaster situations. The findings from the case are contrasted to different challenges in disaster management found in the literature, which supports the design and validation of a framework on the use of these technologies in disaster settings.Three types of case studies can be carried out for research purposes: exploratory, descriptive and explanatory (Yin 1981).

        <p>The initial stage in disaster response includes an assessment of the situation and the number of victims.

        <p>The participation of multiple organisations affects the accuracy and reliability of the information handled (Kovács and Spens 2009;Tatham and Spens 2011;Whybark et al. 2010;Van Wassenhove 2006). For instance, the representation of the floods and affected areas differed from one agency to another. Figure 2 Another problem were the few updates in needs assessment undertaken. Timely needs assessment has been identified as a major challenge because of the quality and responsiveness in information management (Tatham and Spens 2011). For instance, after the initial Federal estimate of over 55 thousand victims, the rest of the requests in October stated 130 thousand victims, requests in November estimated 383 thousand victims and up to mid-December over 253 thousand victims were considered. Beyond the contradiction of this numbers with State estimates, information about sheltered people over time published by authorities showed a different behaviour with variations within months (García, Marín, and Méndez 2009). This is the effect of the complications to compile, manage and share information, which lead to slower processes and larger gaps between data updates. This situation affects logistics flows as decision-making is based on out-of-date information.The participation of multiple organisations affects the accuracy and reliability of the information handled (Kovács and Spens 2009;Tatham and Spens 2011;Whybark et al. 2010;Van Wassenhove 2006).

        <p>Pre-positioning relief is the strategy employed by Mexican authorities for food kits, but most of the products are procured after the conditions of the disaster are known. After needs assessment, authorities request items from a list of authorised suppliers including details about every supplier and the prices of the different items. Despite the reported Federal expenditure in different items such as 1,104,298 food kits, 219,920 blankets or 252,130 mattresses (CEPAL 2008), in the list of 128 suppliers there is virtually no information about the items procured from any one of them (DICONSA 2017a(DICONSA , 2017b)).Pre-positioning relief is the strategy employed by Mexican authorities for food kits, but most of the products are procured after the conditions of the disaster are known.

        <p>Hence, it is impossible to know how procurement decisions were made, what suppliers were elicited, and track the relief. It has been acknowledged that different emergent norms and processes appear in disaster situations (Drabek and McEntire 2003), but the chaotic nature of these settings, the lack of reliable records and the absence of standardised processes among organisations (Tatham and Spens 2011) can affect the quality and impact of the decisions made. Moreover, the lack of reliable information about the decisions made prevents the possibility to learn from experience and implement improvements for future events.Hence, it is impossible to know how procurement decisions were made, what suppliers were elicited, and track the relief.

        <p>Despite the different efforts and resources invested, a main issue was the shortage of critical items. Limitations of resources commonly affect disaster operations (Kovács and Spens 2009), but these can be amplified by unreliable information. For instance, at the beginning of the emergency all areas were affected by constraints in resources, as shown in the second request (October 30 th ) in which authorities could not cover even 60% of the needs (FONDEN 2007). That problem affected certain areas more than others. For instance, on the report from November 7 th , municipalities such as Cardenas, Centro, Jalapa, Macuspan, Nacajuca, Tacotalpa and Teapa received less that the estimations from Federal authorities. Shortages can be attributed to the limited capacity of the suppliers, which are not used to steep surges in demand. The absence of reliable information combined with the uncertainty of demand prevent effective procurement management Apte 2009; Kovács and Spens 2009;Whybark et al. 2010;Van Wassenhove 2006). Additionally, there is high staff turnover affecting managing and distribution activities (Tatham and Spens 2011;Van Wassenhove 2006) along with shifting priorities of relief over time (Apte 2009;Van Wassenhove 2006;Whybark et al. 2010) which modify resource requirements. On the other hand, there can be challenging conditions preventing to reach certain areas. Infrastructure damages are common after disasters strike an area, which affect the capability to reach some of the regions affected (Kovács and Spens 2009;Tatham and Spens 2011;Van Wassenhove 2006). That was the case in Mexico, in which several parts of Tabasco were difficult to access for vehicles. For instance, Figure 3 shows several isolated areas in Centro which could not be reached by roads. The circumstances forced authorities to use different vehicles including boats and helicopters (SEMAR 2007;DICONSA 2014). The combination of these factors explains the reports of shortages found on different documents and news outlets (Santos-Reyes, Alvarado-Corona, and Olmos-Peña 2010).Despite the different efforts and resources invested, a main issue was the shortage of critical items. Limitations of resources commonly affect disaster operations (Kovács and Spens 2009), but these can be amplified by unreliable information. For instance, at the beginning of the emergency all areas were affected by constraints in resources, as shown in the second request (October 30 th ) in which authorities could not cover even 60% of the needs (FONDEN 2007). That problem affected certain areas more than others. For instance, on the report from November 7 th , municipalities such as Cardenas, Centro, Jalapa, Macuspan, Nacajuca, Tacotalpa and Teapa received less that the estimations from Federal authorities. Shortages can be attributed to the limited capacity of the suppliers, which are not used to steep surges in demand. The absence of reliable information combined with the uncertainty of demand prevent effective procurement management Apte 2009; Kovács and Spens 2009;Whybark et al. 2010;Van Wassenhove 2006). Additionally, there is high staff turnover affecting managing and distribution activities (Tatham and Spens 2011;Van Wassenhove 2006) along with shifting priorities of relief over time (Apte 2009;Van Wassenhove 2006;Whybark et al. 2010) which modify resource requirements. On the other hand, there can be challenging conditions preventing to reach certain areas. Infrastructure damages are common after disasters strike an area, which affect the capability to reach some of the regions affected (Kovács and Spens 2009;Tatham and Spens 2011;Van Wassenhove 2006). That was the case in Mexico, in which several parts of Tabasco were difficult to access for vehicles.

        <p>In major disasters, affected communities are contacted by other regions, NGOs and governments to offer support. Fuelled by the relief shortages experienced, various States, Countries and International organisations offered human and material resources in the case of Tabasco. Additionally, several self-initiated participants appear with the intention to engage in disaster operations (Drabek and McEntire 2003;Wachtendorf and Kendra 2004;Whybark et al. 2010) As a result, the large number of participants and conflicting records makes it near impossible to estimate the number of human, material and financial resources involved in operations (CEPAL 2008), which is a common problem in disaster situations (Drabek and McEntire 2003). This represents a significant challenge for accountability in order to avoid corruption in relief activities, which has been experienced in different disasters (Schultz and Søreide 2008). Also, this situation complicates the management of the disaster fund (FONDEN), which provides support for preparation, response and recovery activities in the country. It affects budget planning, as unreliable records are used as one of the few sources of information to plan budgets for future events.In major disasters, affected communities are contacted by other regions, NGOs and governments to offer support.

        <p>Externally, there is a list of items shipped by governments and international organisations to the Mexican government, but it only accounts for the arrival to Mexican territory and the organisation in charge of managing it (SRE 2014). Tracking the benefited areas, however, is complicated because of the chaotic conditions experienced. It is difficult to provide a notion of the impact of the resources provided by FONDEN, but it becomes even more challenging to identify how private resources donated into the area were used. Donors are a relevant source of relief (Kovács and Spens 2007), but their independence can lead to having low-priority or no-priority items reaching the affected region (Holguín-Veras et al. 2014) because of the lack of information about the actual situation (Apte 2009;Kovács and Spens 2009;Tatham and Spens 2011;Whybark et al. 2010) and unpredictability of demand (Apte 2009;Kovács and Spens 2009;Whybark et al. 2010;Van Wassenhove 2006). Despite the importance of managing donations, records about the individual donors sending financial or material relief are scarce, and information tracing their use to the individual victims is non-existent. The effect is twofold: resources might not be used for the intended purpose, and there is a diminished trust from the donors (Wei and Marinova 2016).Externally, there is a list of items shipped by governments and international organisations to the Mexican government, but it only accounts for the arrival to Mexican territory and the organisation in charge of managing it (SRE 2014).

        <p>In the case of Tabasco, it is difficult to identify the mechanism for allocation of resources and the impact and benefit of each donation or fund. This can be problematic because in developing countries there is a politically volatile climate (Van Wassenhove 2006), which can lead to social unrest. The result were complaints about financial donations not reaching the intended areas (Morales and Barboza 2007) and political interference in resource allocation (Dudley 2007) because of the lack of certainty about the use of resources and the subsequent trust loss in authorities.In the case of Tabasco, it is difficult to identify the mechanism for allocation of resources and the impact and benefit of each donation or fund.

        <p>Technology plays a crucial role for information handling and usage in disaster It is interesting to note how these challenges show the intrinsic link between the logistics, financial and information flows. It is essential to look at those links to propose alternatives to strengthen supply chains (Wang, Jia, et al. 2019). This article argues that the combination of AI, 3DP and BC can provide suitable answers for these challenges.Technology plays a crucial role for information handling and usage in disaster It is interesting to note how these challenges show the intrinsic link between the logistics, financial and information flows.

        <p>Needs assessment is the foundation of response operations, because it triggers relief activities by providing details about the conditions in the area and the potential number of victims. The case provide evidence of inaccurate and infrequent needs assessment, which aligns with findings in previous disasters (Tatham and Spens 2011). Shifting priorities and uncertainty of demand are inherent aspects of disaster situations which have a significant effect on the volume and type of resources required (Whybark et al. 2010;Kovács and Spens 2009). The result can lead to an excess of low-priority products causing congestion and the need for extra resources (Kovács and Spens 2007), or shortages of high-priority items leading to complaints and poor levels of service for the victims. Considering the shortcomings in needs assessment and the independence from donors, AI represents an opportunity to improve decision-making. Initially, AI can be used in combination with historical information to predict initial patterns of demand to complement information from the field (Mohammadi, Fatemi Ghomi, and Zeinali 2014), and once more information is known it can prioritise the items in order to augment decisions from relief organisations and donors. Supervised machine learning (SML) can use real-time information obtained from the varied data sources (Ragini, Anand, and Bhaskar 2018) at the source (e.g. location information from tracking sensors, extent of impact in the disaster location from satellite imagery and social media, estimated number of victims from shelter reports, repair and medical aid requirements from needs assessment), to prioritise resource allocation by employing clustering and classification. The clustering aggregates related resources (e.g. medical, food, shelter aid) into a single unit, and the classification aids in prioritising the units (i.e. each cluster) for a given location. SML uses historical information and decisions made as a baseline denominated the target exemplary set to learn and propose priorities for deployment of resources. In that way, the decision mechanisms are transparent, input data is more reliable through the combination of different sources, and the decisions about relief allocation and distribution are augmented by truly considering the impact of the disaster on the different areas and looking at all the resources available in the system.Needs assessment is the foundation of response operations, because it triggers relief activities by providing details about the conditions in the area and the potential number of victims.

        <p>The output of the AI can be visualised in dashboards in the form of recommendations to the organisations and relevant decision makers (such as governmental organisations, budget holders and donors) using web and mobile-based platforms. The visualisation can provide a deeper and broader understanding of the recommendations by showing the rationale behind them, the data sources used, and a summary of the training set used by the learning algorithms. This allow decision makers to allocate and deploy resources in an effective and efficient manner. This transparency helps to increase the trust of the decision-makers on the recommendations and drives the adoption of such technologies to develop dynamic expert systems to augment human decision-making in HSCs. Hence, the potential of AI can be employed to manage resources more efficiently to enhance logistics flows and make more efficient use of financial flows.The output of the AI can be visualised in dashboards in the form of recommendations to the organisations and relevant decision makers (such as governmental organisations, budget holders and donors) using web and mobile-based platforms.

        <p>Decisions, especially in urgent settings, must be made based on an accurate and updated flow of information (Tatham and Spens 2011). The case revealed that information management is one of the major challenges faced in Mexico. This was expected as information and communication are challenges commonly found in disaster situations (Kovács and Spens 2009). The case showed duplication of efforts, inconsistent information among different organisations, absence of information sharing, the use of out-of-date information for decision-making, the existence of unreliable information, and lack of records. Improving needs assessment processes involves to communicate information timely and improve reliability (Tatham and Spens 2011). BC can dramatically reduce the number of decisions made with out-of-date information and to increase the overall credibility of the operations.Decisions, especially in urgent settings, must be made based on an accurate and updated flow of information (Tatham and Spens 2011).

        <p>BC also has enormous potential to improve information sharing among the participants and enhance their collaboration, which stemmed as a problem in the case of Tabasco and it has been noted as a complication in previous disasters (Rodríguez-Espíndola, Albores, and Brewster 2018a).

        <p>The case also showed a major need for visibility of the financial resources sent to the area to ensure the adequate use of them. Complaints about political bias and deviation of funds align with findings arguing that corruption and lack of trust are a major barrier in disaster operations in developing countries (Schultz and Søreide 2008).The case also showed a major need for visibility of the financial resources sent to the area to ensure the adequate use of them.

        <p>BC can allow donors and external organisations to trace their contributions and make sure they are used for disaster relief, as it introduces visibility, traceability and transparency for all types of transactions, which will lead to better accountability.

        <p>BC would allow to track the path of each relief product individually from the supplier to the beneficiary. There is a strong focus on what is supplied to the area, but it is also important to look at when and from whom. The outcome of using BC would be reliable information about the use of procurement budgets and accurate records and control of suppliers, thereby providing visibility and legitimacy to relief distribution. Additionally, it allows to identify the benefited areas to prevent the duplication of activities.BC would allow to track the path of each relief product individually from the supplier to the beneficiary.

        <p>Past experiences in the field have motivated the development of different measures to reduce response time (Kunz, Reiner, and Gold 2014). Nevertheless, leadtime reduction is still a major challenge. Expediting procurement can be vital to reduce lead times. The use of BC-enabled smart contracts can allow to speed up the procurement process by triggering the immediate request of items once the needs assessment is in place (Dolgui et al. 2019). These contracts can be used by governments and other organisations, thereby reducing the complexity of their interactions with suppliers and decreasing procurement lead times, also contributing to more transparent supply chains (Kamble, Gunasekaran, and Arha 2018).Past experiences in the field have motivated the development of different measures to reduce response time (Kunz, Reiner, and Gold 2014).

        <p>The case exhibits a situation in which shortage of supplies stemmed from different reasons. A major cause were requests below the actual requirements. In that instance, suppliers may struggle to react swiftly to the steep variation in requests from authorities from one period to the next, and the absence of alternative suppliers found in different countries can delay relief (Van Wassenhove 2006). Additionally, roads to different areas were found unusable, constraining transportation because of damages to infrastructure (Sahin, Narayanan, and Robinson 2013). Despite the focus on lead-time reduction (Kunz, Reiner, and Gold 2014), the inherent disruption of supply found on disaster situations makes on-site production a very impactful alternative. It allows products or components to be produced as and when needed, without waiting for deliveries. For example, in earthquake-hit Nepal, 3DP has been used to repair damaged water pipes (Jones 2015) and produce medical equipment in field hospitals (Parkin 2017).The case exhibits a situation in which shortage of supplies stemmed from different reasons.

        <p>The use of 3DP to produce some of the items in the affected areas can be beneficial to reduce lead times for distribution and to mitigate the congestion in the supply chain by reducing the number of items being requested, sorted and managed. This would be important to reduce the burden on suppliers, reduce the convergence of items towards the affected areas (Holguín-Veras et al. 2014), allow to direct activities in distribution centres towards specific urgent items, reduce the number of material and human resources used for relief distribution, and satisfying the needs of isolated areas more effectively. This way relevant items can be produced on-site to solve immediate problems, to reinstate services and to aid reconstruction efforts (Delgado Camacho et al. 2018).The use of 3DP to produce some of the items in the affected areas can be beneficial to reduce lead times for distribution and to mitigate the congestion in the supply chain by reducing the number of items being requested, sorted and managed.

        <p>Each one of the technologies presented have the potential to make significant strides towards successful operations. However, each one of them relies on a set of conditions that can be difficult to achieve in chaotic situations.

        <p>3DP is an invaluable technology for on-site production during and after the disasters to improve logistics flows, but it lacks efficient decision-making mechanisms to maximise the benefits from production. At the same time, it requires accurate information about the needs, which can be obscured during the disaster (Van Wassenhove 2006), as shown in the case of Mexico. Therefore, both AI and 3DP require significant improvement in information flows to achieve real impact on operations. The solution can be their integration with BC. BC can be a major player in enhancing communication, managing information from multiple sources, sharing data, enabling immediate response, and introducing accountability and traceability. Hence, it can improve information flows and become a key component on financial and logistics flows, which complements nicely the potential and requirements from AI and 3DP.3DP is an invaluable technology for on-site production during and after the disasters to improve logistics flows, but it lacks efficient decision-making mechanisms to maximise the benefits from production.

        <p>The analysis of the case combined with the independent revision of the technologies provides a picture about the current needs to improve the three flows: financial, information and logistics.

Reference source not found.4 provides a representation of the framework proposed in this paper. Combining these technologies, while not solving all challenges, can provide substantial improvements to augmenting, tracing and implementing decisions in HSCs. BC is the corner stone of the framework proposed because it allows control over the type of information provided by external sources and offers a bridge between the AI and 3DP layers (Dinh and Thai 2018;Mandolla et al. 2019), because improvement on the information flow is the basis for enhancing logistics and financial flows (Wang, Jia, et al. 2019).The analysis of the case combined with the independent revision of the technologies provides a picture about the current needs to improve the three flows: financial, information and logistics.

        <p>The integration of BC and AI into the framework presented can contribute to reduce problems in financial, information and logistics flows. This combination can introduce a two-way information flow, allowing governments, organisations and donors to understand what is needed, as well as predicting what might be next, based on appropriate analytics. From the operational perspective, the information transmitted through BC can be used by AI to contextualise and augment decisions. AI can provide reliable forecasts and a near real-time prioritisation of the items required, and it can be updated to allow collaboration among stakeholders through the use of BC. Furthermore, the combination of BC and AI would not only allow the use of smart contracts, but it would also enable the possibility of automated arbitration to reduce disruption (Dinh and Thai 2018). The overall effect would be reduction of unwanted relief items, increased possibility of the wanted items reaching the area and a reduction in transport bottlenecks.The integration of BC and AI into the framework presented can contribute to reduce problems in financial, information and logistics flows.

        <p>Regarding on-site production, despite the advantages of 3DP, concerns about reimbursement and liability (Srai et al. 2016) prevent its use in HSCs. BC offers a potential route to solving both of these issues because it mitigates trustless environments (Mandolla et al. 2019). Firstly, to avoid leakage of IP, BC can be used to trace who receives and shares designs and ensure an appropriate payment has been received for the right to print (Savelyev 2018). Secondly, to control liability, BC can be used to control the authenticity and originality of designs. Incorporating BC would allow the information and financial flows to be managed near real-time (Mandolla et al. 2019), allowing the affected area to produce needed parts and allowing the manufacturer to maintain control over their IP and liability. At the same time, 3DP can benefit from integration with other platforms through BC to support product design, planning and printing (Wang, Lin, et al. 2019).Regarding on-site production, despite the advantages of 3DP, concerns about reimbursement and liability (Srai et al. 2016) prevent its use in HSCs.

        <p>The combination of the three components can help change the paradigm from government-led to citizen-led disaster response supported by the willingness of people to help (Gunessee et al. 2018). Logistics and financial flows can be supported by the production of items on-site (Tatham, Loy, and Peretti 2015), thereby allowing victims to take part in their own recovery and support areas difficult to reach through traditional channels. Through prioritisation, which involves accounting for which items are most needed, and considering which items can be efficiently made rather than transported, AI can enable the appropriate use of 3DP in near-real time through the use of BC. This way AI can guide the decision about what is procured and what is produced, and BC can coordinate 3DP facilities to reduce the number of items that need to be transported.The combination of the three components can help change the paradigm from government-led to citizen-led disaster response supported by the willingness of people to help (Gunessee et al. 2018).

        <p>Additionally, controlling the digital files, sharing the information from the AI, triggering smart contracts, keeping traceability of the relief items, maintaining acceptable quality, and ensuring intellectual property is protected and paid for can be contributions from BC. Hence, the implementation of the framework proposed would reduce congestion in the supply chain by reducing the flow of unwanted items (AI), reducing duplication of efforts and procurement (BC) and allowing the production of items on-site (3DP). The impact would be reduction of delays, fewer resources needed to sort and manage products, and a more streamlined distribution, thereby reducing potential congestion by offering secure and traceable options for the flow of products, money and on-site production.
