        <p>Analyzing multiple data sources from a global information technology (IT) consulting multinational enterprise (MNE), this research unpacks the configuration of a digitalized HR ecosystem of artificial intelligence(AI)-assisted human resource management (HRM) applications and HR platforms. This study develops a novel theoretical framework mapping the nature and purpose of a digitalized AI-assisted HR ecosystem for delivering exceptional employee experience (EX), an antecedent to employee engagement (EE). Employing the theoretical lenses of EX, EE, AI-mediated social exchange, and engagement platforms, this study's overarching aim of this article is to establish how AI-assisted HRM fits into an organization's ecosystem and, second, how it impacts EX and EE. Our findings show that AI-assisted applications for HRM enhance EX and, thus, EE. We also see increases in employee productivity and HR function's effectiveness. Implications for research and practice are also discussed.Analyzing multiple data sources from a global information technology (IT) consulting multinational enterprise (MNE), this research unpacks the configuration of a digitalized HR ecosystem of artificial intelligence(AI)-assisted human resource management (HRM) applications and HR platforms.

        <p>With increased digitalization at the workplace, especially as we manage HR ecosystems, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and other disruptive technology platforms for enhancing the employee experience (EX) of HR practices and employee engagement (EE) at work is gaining importance (Bersin et al., 2017;IBM &amp; Globoforce, 2016). As workplace digitalization increases, employees interact with the various digitalized assets in an organization's ecosystem, yet, the ability of HRM to cope with the challenges of an AI-assisted HRM remains a concern (Budhwar et al., 2022;Charlwood &amp; Guenole, 2022;Swart et al., 2020). We know from prior research that introducing AI-assisted HRM applications in an organization's ecosystem creates anxieties among employees and can adversely (Presbitero &amp; Teng-Calleja, 2022;Suseno et al., 2022) or positively affect employee and business outcomes (Malik, Budhwar, et al., 2021;Malik, Budhwar, et al., 2022). Nevertheless, little research examines the impact of AI adoption in HRM on EX and EE (Braganza et al., 2021). Despite its increase, there is a limited theoretical basis for understanding how AI-assisted HRM infrastructure fits into an organization's broader ecosystem and how firms design and implement an HR ecosystem and a configuration of digitalized AI applications to cater to the firm's digital, human and physical aspects of the work environment for improving EX and EE levels. Examining the adoption of AI-assisted HRM in a firm's ecosystem is also critical, especially as firms have faced EX and EE issues since the pandemic began (Hancock &amp; Schaninger, 2020). Theoretically, this problem is further compounded as there is significant diversity in the conceptualizations of EX (Bersin et al., 2017;IBM &amp; Globoforce, 2016;Malik, Budhwar, et al., 2022;Malik, De Silva, et al., 2021;Maylett &amp; Wride, 2017;Morgan, 2017;Bunchapattanasakda, 2019) and the approaches employed (MacCormick et al., 2012;Mirvis, 2012). The above inconsistencies lead to problems of measurement and validity for advancing scholarly work. Though the theory of EE is well established, the term EX is often used interchangeably to misrepresent EE. Therefore, this article reviews the literature on EX, delineates the differences between the two concepts and suggests the relationship by offering an integrated definition of EX and its conceptualization. This is an important contribution to the literature on EX, especially in integrating AI-assisted HRM into an organization's ecosystem. It is critical to clarify how EX in the AI-assisted HRM applications in a firm's ecosystem critically influences EE (Shenoy &amp; Uchil, 2018). Our review and empirical data confirm that EX is an antecedent of EE, thus allowing further research on the topic. AI-assisted HRM applications can capture continuous and realtime employee data and perceptions from all aspects of an employee's physical, human, and digital work environment. This view is akin to the emerging literature on customer engagement platforms (Breidbach et al., 2014) and a recent conceptualization of customer experience (Becker &amp; Jaakkola, 2020). Therefore, understanding how firms develop a configuration of AI-assisted HRM applications and platforms and fit it as part of their broader ecosystem is timely and needed for delivering the right set of EX and EE outcomes. Further, the strategic choices and knowledge regarding the configuration and quality of AI-assisted HRM applications designed and implemented are needed in the domain of HRM to achieve high levels of EX and EE. This approach highlights how HR leaders can exercise strategic choices to create a digitalized HR ecosystem for higher levels of EX and EE.

        <p>To summarize, this study offers the following distinctive contributions. First, it contributes by showing how AI-assisted HRM fits into the literature on HR ecosystems. Second, the impact of a firm's digitalized HR ecosystem comprising a configuration of AI-assisted HRM platforms on EE and EX (Gheidar &amp; ShamiZanjani, 2020;Kim &amp; Gatling, 2018;Shivakumar, 2020). Third, it clarifies the ongoing debates in the literature on EX and EE in using an AI-assisted technology-mediated social exchange. Finally, we develop an integrated theoretical framework for understanding how a configuration of AI-assisted HR applications fits into a firm's HR ecosystem and impacts EX and EE. We do this by employing the theoretical lenses of AI-mediated social exchange theory, EE, and engagement platforms (Blau, 1964;Breidbach et al., 2014;Kahn, 1990;Ma &amp; Brown, 2020;Macey &amp; Schneider, 2008).To summarize, this study offers the following distinctive contributions.

        <p>Our choice of the above theoretical frameworks is relevant as, firstly, social exchange theory (Blau, 1964) is a foundational theory for EX and EE programs, as it is built on the foundations of trust and exchange of value between an employee and its workplace practices.Our choice of the above theoretical frameworks is relevant as, firstly, social exchange theory (Blau, 1964) is a foundational theory for EX and EE programs, as it is built on the foundations of trust and exchange of value between an employee and its workplace practices.</p>
        <p>Employees experience stimuli from various sources and will thus react and respond to each stimulus based on their perceptions. Second, the AI-mediated social exchange theory (Ma &amp; Brown, 2020) is also timely as employees interact and share knowledge through technologicallymediated AI applications that are part of a firm's digital HRM ecosystem. Third, the nature of the technologically mediated social exchange through these AI-based technology platforms invariably invokes a norm of reciprocity between the HR designers and employees (Ma &amp; Brown, 2020), which affects the quality of EX. Similarly, the literature on EE (Bakker &amp; Albrecht, 2018;Burnett &amp; Lisk, 2019;Kahn, 1990;Smith, 2019) and the use of platforms that can enhance EX (Bersin et al., 2017;Burrell &amp; Gherson, 2018;Shivakumar, 2020) is vital in understanding how and why firms exercise strategic choices in developing their digitalized HR ecosystem of AI-assisted HRM applications.Employees experience stimuli from various sources and will thus react and respond to each stimulus based on their perceptions.

        <p>Extant literature suggests that a positive EX leads to higher levels of EE (Itam &amp; Ghosh, 2020;Morgan, 2017;Plaskoff, 2017) and positive employee and business outcomes, such as work performance, discretionary effort and retention (IBM &amp; Globoforce, 2016). However, a significant trend affecting work design and HR policies is the technologically savvy multi-generational workforce that demands a new way of thinking about their EX (Bersin et al., 2017;Burrell &amp; Gherson, 2018;IBM &amp; Globoforce, 2016;Shivakumar, 2020) and EE at the workplace (Kahn, 1990;Macey &amp; Schneider, 2008). This approach departs from the current episodic and event-based system of EE (Budhwar &amp; Bhatnagar, 2007) and exclusive talent management focusing on an exclusive rewards and benefits menu for key talent (Cappelli, 2008;Farndale et al., 2020;Scullion &amp; Collings, 2011). Further, in large firms, new technologies can enable effective EE and management of diverse generational talents, using an AI-assisted HRM engagement platform for managing people in a firm's HR ecosystem (Malik, De Silva, et al., 2021). The review begins by explaining the differences between EE and EX and then presents a review, definition and reconceptualization of EX, positing it is a vital and missing link for high levels of EE.Extant literature suggests that a positive EX leads to higher levels of EE (Itam &amp; Ghosh, 2020;Morgan, 2017;Plaskoff, 2017) and positive employee and business outcomes, such as work performance, discretionary effort and retention (IBM &amp; Globoforce, 2016).

        <p>Employee Engagement. In his seminal ethnographic work, Kahn (1990: p. 694), inspiring much of the scientific work on engagement, stated engagement as "harnessing of organization members" selves to their work roles; by which they employ and express themselves physically, emotionally, and cognitively during role'. The seminal work by Kahn (1990) conceptualizes EE as the psychological conditions (of meaningfulness, safety, and availability) of an individual's engagement or disengagement at work. Employees express themselves cognitively, emotionally and physically in their tasks when engaged.Employee Engagement.

        <p>Therefore, this approach highlights the exercise of rational choice and individual agency on the part of employees (Cole et al., 2012). Others, such as Macey and Schneider (2008), used three different types of engagement-psychological state, behavioral engagement, and trait engagement as critical elements of EE, whereas, Schaufeli et al. (2002) defined engagement as "a positive, fulfilling, work-related state of mind that is characterized by vigour, dedication, and absorption" (p. 74). In practice, however, the dominant approach to EE is often measured as an episodic, one-off event or a series of time-bound activities, as evidenced through popular surveys like Gallup's Q12 survey (Gallup, 2021). Such approaches, though popular, are reactive and implement changes in EE levels post hoc. The temporal and contextual influences on engagement have only recently gathered attention in an emerging stream of research on EX (see, for example, Morgan, 2017;Plaskoff, 2017). Globoforce, 2017). Several conceptualizations of EX exist in the literature. Morgan (2017, p. 8), for example, defined EX as "the intersection of employee expectations, needs, and wants and the organizational design of those expectations, needs and wants", whereas Plaskoff (2017) defined EX as "the employee's holistic perceptions of the relationship with his/her employing organization derived from all the encounters at touchpoints along the employee's journey" (p. 137). Morgan (2017) We differentiate and build a deeper understanding of EX by drawing upon service management and customer experience literature. The literature review on customer experience notes three main approaches in explaining customer experience formation concerning accessing a service: individual, contextual or a mix of both (Becker &amp; Jaakkola, 2020;Lipkin, 2016). We focus on the first approach-the individual-wherein individuals may be active or passive participants with some control over the experience formation process. In this stream of literature, most studies focus on the stimulus-organismresponse (SOR) model (Mehrabian &amp; Russell, 1974) or a sensationperception framework (Fechner, 1860(Fechner, /1966)), which has its theoretical roots in the environmental and behavioral psychology. The basic thrust of this approach is that an individual receives stimuli from the external environment, which affects an individual's (organism's) cognitive and affective state and leads to a behavioral response.Therefore, this approach highlights the exercise of rational choice and individual agency on the part of employees (Cole et al., 2012).

        <p>Similarly, the sensation-perception framework (Fechner, 1860(Fechner, /1966) ) argues that external environmental sensations trigger an individual's internal perception process, leading to a response. Both theoretical streams characterize perception as a process of interpreting responses through an individual's internal cognitive and affective state and attaching a meaning to the stimuli/sensations from the external environment (Goldstein &amp; Cacciamani, 2021). Thus, perception is an intermediating mechanism between an individual's interactions and reactions to his/her external environment (Pareigis et al., 2012).Similarly, the sensation-perception framework (Fechner, 1860(Fechner, /1966) ) argues that external environmental sensations trigger an individual's internal perception process, leading to a response.

        <p>Building on the above concepts of customer experience management, Abhari et al. (2008) coined the term EX management, viewing employees as internal customers, and that firms must motivate their employees by delivering the right brand experiences and value-added offerings through five experiential needs of employees (cognitive, emotional, social, sensorial, and practical needs: p. 1). These experiential needs are well-documented in the literature on customer experience management (Becker &amp; Jaakkola, 2020). Employees receive a vast range of stimuli from the external environment, and emotions are a generic term through which we express our experiences (Gordon, 1987in Harikkala-Laihinen, 2020). Emotional reactions are used to express our day-to-day experiences of the work environment.Building on the above concepts of customer experience management, Abhari et al.

        <p>So, as employees receive stimuli from the environment, after cognitive and affective processing of the stimuli, they express their experience via an intermediating process of perceptions and frame a response.So, as employees receive stimuli from the environment, after cognitive and affective processing of the stimuli, they express their experience via an intermediating process of perceptions and frame a response.</p>
        <p>For example, an outcome of disengagement is triggered by poor experiences of sadness, despair or helplessness. The stimuli are received at multiple touchpoints in an employee's lifecycle, and these stimuli may not always be under complete managerial control; indeed, some stimuli may be coming from a dynamic interplay between work and nonwork domains. Depending on the quality of reactions and responses to these stimuli, this article argues that employee's reactions and responses to their physical, digital, and human aspects of work will affect their EX, which is why this article argues that EX is a critical antecedent (Plaskoff, 2017;Shenoy &amp; Uchil, 2018) of EE (Kahn, 1990).For example, an outcome of disengagement is triggered by poor experiences of sadness, despair or helplessness.

        <p>Therefore, this article defines EX as continuous, non-deliberate, spontaneous, and real-time employee reactions and responses to diverse stimuli from the AI-assisted HRM applications in a firm's workplace ecosystem. We conceptualize EX based on three sub-dimensions: the stimuli' extent, nature, and perceived relevance. The extent of stimuli is the degree, strength, or frequency of stimuli employees perceive as available. The nature of stimuli is the diversity or range of stimuli and their perceived availability across multiple touchpoints. Finally, the perceived relevance of a stimuli captures, for example, employee motivation to respond to stimuli. See Figure 1 for a graphical model of EX. Several studies within the HRM literature have attempted to capture EX for specific areas of HR services, such as performance appraisal (Farndale &amp; Kelliher, 2013) and flexible work arrangements (Chen &amp; Fulmer, 2018). Often, the experience of such practices has been examined by characterizing employee perceptions. In this study, employees who receive stimuli from AI-assisted HRM applications and HR platforms would reasonably expect to associate it with a promise of increased social exchange with such AI-driven applications and an ongoing long-term exchange with the employee-organization relationship.Therefore, this article defines EX as continuous, non-deliberate, spontaneous, and real-time employee reactions and responses to diverse stimuli from the AI-assisted HRM applications in a firm's workplace ecosystem.

        <p>EX versus EE. Several differences exist between EX, a holistic, dynamic, longer-term, and employee-centric (Morgan, 2017;Plaskoff, 2017), and EE, an episodic, shorter-term, and organizationcentric approach. The literature on EE and EX suggests two distinct approaches-one where EE and EX are treated as unrelated concepts, and the second, where EE is viewed as a result of methodically planning EX. The former views EE as a set of actions and argues that EX affects EE. For example, if employees have a great experience at work because of the culture, technology, or physical spaces, they are much more likely to be engaged. Further, given the multitude of stimuli that employees receive from diverse sources at multiple touchpoints in their employment lifecycle, it makes it difficult for employees and their managers to process and analyze all their reactions, responses, and experiences due to issues, such as bounded rationality, memory recall or other organizational and individual constraints. EE is, therefore, a continuous and dynamic phenomenon and could change over time, based on EX-be it for a single transaction or several transactions. At a minimum, EX must be consistent and honor the EE's core tenet of a psychological contract as fulfilling a psychological contract antedates EE.EX versus EE. Several differences exist between EX, a holistic, dynamic, longer-term, and employee-centric (Morgan, 2017;Plaskoff, 2017), and EE, an episodic, shorter-term, and organizationcentric approach. The literature on EE and EX suggests two distinct approaches-one where EE and EX are treated as unrelated concepts, and the second, where EE is viewed as a result of methodically planning EX. The former views EE as a set of actions and argues that EX affects EE. For example, if employees have a great experience at work because of the culture, technology, or physical spaces, they are much more likely to be engaged.

        <p>Successful IT services firms have developed technology capabilities for leveraging business intelligence systems to respond to the diverse needs of internal and stakeholders by balancing multiple levels of strategic, horizontal, employee, and market fits (Breidbach et al., 2014;Boon et al., 2011;Malik et al., 2018). Moreover, with greater technological maturity and disruptions at work, the design of workplace and HRM practices are changing at both local and global levels (Lepak &amp; Snell, 1999, 2002;Morris et al., 2016), as evidenced by the debates on Industry 4.0 (Schwab, 2017) and increasing adoption of AI-enabled HR applications (Jaiswal et al., 2022;Vrontis et al., 2022). Consequently, digitalization and HR-focused AI applications at the workplace have freed employees' time to focus on non-routine and intrinsically rewarding tasks, thus increasing their overall EX of HRM practices (Malik et al., 2020).Successful IT services firms have developed technology capabilities for leveraging business intelligence systems to respond to the diverse needs of internal and stakeholders by balancing multiple levels of strategic, horizontal, employee, and market fits (Breidbach et al., 2014;Boon et al., 2011;Malik et al., 2018).

        <p>However, some scholars have noted this as an attempt by HR to establish its legitimacy (Mahadevan &amp; Schmitz, 2020). In addition, increased digitalization offers greater scope for integration and convergence of diverse stakeholder needs. Therefore, firms need to revisit their work and employment practice architecture to deliver sustained performance (Lepak &amp; Snell, 1998;Snell &amp; Morris, 2019;Swart &amp; Kinnie, 2014) and EX through such platforms (IBM &amp; Globoforce, 2016;Shivakumar, 2020).However, some scholars have noted this as an attempt by HR to establish its legitimacy (Mahadevan &amp; Schmitz, 2020).

        <p>With the increasing digitalization of EX touchpoints, EX of HRM practices in the physical, digital, and cultural domains through an AImediated social exchange is relatively unexplored (Malik et al., 2020;Malik, De Silva, et al., 2021;Nguyen &amp; Malik, 2021). EE and EX approach in a digitalized workplace are rapidly changing (Breidbach et al., 2014;Kim &amp; Gatling, 2018). The literature on virtual and AI-based EE and EX platforms notes positive results from using such platforms. Accenture (2018), for example, found that companies with highly engaged workforces are 21% more profitable than those with low engagement. This necessitates consideration of AI service quality and assimilation of the HR-assisted AI applications (Nguyen &amp; Malik, 2021;Prikshat et al., 2021) to effectively monitor, track, and analyze employee reactions and responses from diverse sets of static and interactional stimuli employees receive from their environment, including interactions with such AI-assisted HRM applications. In addition, well-designed AI applications can offer personalized and hyperpersonalized EX through AI-mediated social exchanges (Ma &amp; Brown, 2020;Malik et al., 2020;Malik, De Silva, et al., 2021). This research suggests that the AI service quality and the perceived ease of using such AI-enabled applications positively impact EX and employees' usage intentions, thus, resulting in higher engagement levels. In addition, the use of AI-based applications for HRM practices has been linked to greater levels of personalization in learning and development (Whiteside, 2019), employee coaching (Barney, 2018), managing performance (Basu Mallick, 2019), administrative tasks (Haak, 2019) and other employee outcomes and HR effectiveness (Malik et al., 2020;Malik, De Silva, et al., 2021).With the increasing digitalization of EX touchpoints, EX of HRM practices in the physical, digital, and cultural domains through an AImediated social exchange is relatively unexplored (Malik et al., 2020;Malik, De Silva, et al., 2021;Nguyen &amp; Malik, 2021).

        <p>Building on the social exchange theory's key arguments (Blau, 1964), there are three fundamental aspects: relationship, reciprocity, and F I G U R E 1 Key dimensions of EX. *Stimuli are characterized by AI-assisted HRM Applications exchange. In a human-to-human social exchange, following a workplace relationship, the exchange between two parties typically relates to an economic or social value exchange between the parties involved (Blau, 1964). The norm of reciprocity underpins it. Further, with the increasing adoption of AI applications in digitalized workplaces, an AImediated social exchange typically occurs between employees or humans with other humans through machines (e.g., an AI application or a bot). The scholarship on the use of AI-based HRM applications and experience of AI-based HRM ecosystems is on the rise and highlights a positive impact on EX and HR outcomes (Makarius et al., 2020;Malik et al., 2020;Malik, De Silva, et al., 2021;Shivakumar, 2020). AI autonomous applications can act human-like and use their agency in a technologically mediated social exchange (Ma &amp; Brown, 2020). At the centre of this technology-mediated social exchange is the value derived by the individual or the firm through such an exchange, such that a positive exchange, resulting in productivity gains or a positive EX can lead to a range of employee outcomes, such as increased intention to use AI applications, high levels of engagement and lower intentions to quit (Kim &amp; Gatling, 2018;Malik et al., 2020;Malik, De Silva, et al., 2021). The employeeorganization relationship is an overarching term describing the relationship between the employee and the organization and includes micro-attachments such as the concepts of EE, psychological empowerment, and the psychological contract (Coyle-Shapiro &amp; Shore, 2007). The exchange breaks down if there is a drop in such experience by either beneficiary involved. Thus, the AI-mediated social exchange is different from the traditional social exchange. See Table 1 below for differences between the traditional forms of social exchange and an AI-mediated social exchange. Unlike the physical forms of social exchange, an AI-mediated social exchange involves human interactions that are mediated through AI applications. The quality and extent of data democratization afforded by such AI-assisted applications increase the opportunities for employees' real-time, continuous, and hyper-personalized stimuli. This opens up opportunities for employees' rich and relevant reactions and responses, thus affecting their EX.Building on the social exchange theory's key arguments (Blau, 1964), there are three fundamental aspects: relationship, reciprocity, and F I G U R E 1 Key dimensions of EX. *Stimuli are characterized by AI-assisted HRM Applications exchange.

        <p>We chose India for its extreme ethnic, political, cultural, business, and spiritual diversity (Budhwar et al., 2020;Mishra &amp; Varma, 2019). It has a rich cultural heritage of ancient administrative guidelines of the Arthasharata dating back to 3000 BC, wherein the fundamental principles of holistic management practised in the past are still relevant to new knowledge-intensive firms in the Pharmaceutical, Ayurveda, healthcare, and IT industries (Malik et al., 2018;Malik, Budhwar, et al., 2021), including those at the bottom-of-the-pyramid (Basu et al., 2021). India is also home to the most highly sought-after technology talent globally (Pereira &amp; Malik, 2015) and is indeed one of the most preferred geographical locations for MNEs seeking to establish their global innovation hubs in India (Malik, Sharma, et al., 2021;Pereira &amp; Malik, 2015). Even though there is an acknowledgment of India's deep pockets of technical and highly skilled innovative talent, there is still a dark side and cultural issues that need recognition and attention to give due credit to the innovativeness of Indian knowledge workers; else they end up being affected by neo-colonial power excesses (Malik, Mahadevan, et al., 2021). The differences in values between Generation Y expatriates and Generation X managers have been problematic for mGen Y employees (Pereira et al., 2017).

Next, this was followed by focusing on how these applications were designed and implemented for their HRM function. The next set of questions examined how it affected the business and end-users (e.g., managers and employees) experience of these AIassisted HRM applications. As part of this, the HR managers, designers of the AI-assisted solutions, and employees were asked further questions about their experiences of the HRM practices through these applications and with the broader AI-assisted workplace ecosystem comprising physical and digital artifacts. Some illustrative questions asked were: How clear are you about your goals and objectives? When was the last time you got recognized for your contributions? What promotes (and prevents) collaboration for you at the workplace? Are you able to speak without any fear of retribution? -these questions were aimed to elicit EX across various HRM processes. Finally, a deeper probe of the employees and managers focused on questions related to the end-users experience at an employee outcome level (e.g., satisfaction, loyalty, and commitment). These questions also examined the efficiency and effectiveness at a business and strategy level.First, the questions focused on the nature and extent of technological innovation designed and implemented by BigTech in AI technologies in various functional domains.

The manual coding generated the following first-order codes: people, teams, rewards, projects, work, diversity, needs, knowledge, innovation, technology, ideas, experience, voice, solutions, and problem-solving. This was followed by coding a targeted theoretical second-order coding of theme, such as values, HRM practices, physical, digital, and values ecosystem, and EX and EE, using a theoretically informed abductive logic approach (Dubois &amp; Gadde, 2002;Van Maanen et al., 2007) for our analysis.

For example, the theme focusing on disseminating BigTech's values of a holistic approach to managing employee health and wellness by focusing on the mind, body, heart, and soul needs was embedded in several AI-assisted applications that formed a part of its digitalized HR ecosystem and EE platform and underpinned each of the six sub-themes. Similarly, the mydigital and myphysical theme shows BigTech invested in AI-assisted applications that deliver a digitally accessible workplace, meeting employees' physical and digital needs by offering a continuous and seamless social and mobile experience (See Table 3 for details).This first meta-theme has six sub-functional themes (myTeam/Unit, myCareer, myWellness, myRecognition, myTalent, and myVoice) and captures the key domain of HRM practices employees experienced through the AI-assisted HRM system.

        <p>The analysis suggests that EX is not a discrete phenomenon confined only to office hours and traditional work boundaries. Instead, employees continuously receive stimuli from work and non-work domains as the boundaries become blurred. Therefore, EX is the responsibility of both HR and business leaders to get involved and cocreate an AI-based HR ecosystem for delivering exceptional EX. While traditional EE relies on "events" across "locations" and has its advantages, EE depends on the quality of EX that employees have had as they react and respond to diverse stimuli they continuously receive from the ecosystem's physical, digital and cultural domains. The HR team at BigTech Services explored ways to offer continuous, relevant, and meaningful EX. For example, as employees join a team, they look to build careers, be recognized, stay healthy while balancing work and personal life, and follow their passion and voice their opinions.The analysis suggests that EX is not a discrete phenomenon confined only to office hours and traditional work boundaries.

        <p>myRewards and recognition. Appropriate recognition and rewards at the workplace can help extract an employee's discretionary efforts. However, for any reward or recognition initiative to be effective, it needs to be timely and visibly impact the employee's social currency. In other words, the recognition needs to be real-time, and BigTech Services could launch its AI and automation efforts at scale to make a demographically consistent employee base. However, given the service diversity at BigTech Services, this would have probably delivered sub-optimal results. The efforts under the framework needed to be personalized. This was achieved by defining the typical "persona" of employees who will experience the initiatives and actions that align with the persona's traits. For example, a persona could be of a (1) young executive entering the organization from campus, (2) firsttime/new manager leading a team, (3) mid-level career professional wanting to explore opportunities within, or (4) professionals across the hierarchy wanting to express themselves through their passion beyond work, and so on. The list of personas can be lengthy, and it would be a humongous task for HR and business teams to define a single program that suits all personae's needs. In line with prior studies, the traditional one-size-fits-all approach to managing employees was considered, at best, sub-optimal (Kinnie et al., 2005). Instead, BigTech Services decided to engage with employees in a long-term symbiotic relationship. BigTech Services' digitalization approach integrates technology with how the world of work is organized. This framework straddles the cultural, digital, and physical continuum and sets the foundation for developing BigTech's AI-based HRM ecosystem for EX. We refer to this as PeopleXp, a framework that provides a platform(s) to engage with employees holistically and continuously, and consistently.

        <p>The findings point to high EX levels (Plaskoff, 2017;Malik et al., 2020;Malik, De Silva, et al., 2021;), which positively impact EE (Kahn, 1990;Shenoy &amp; Uchil, 2018) through the use of AI-assisted applications. As part of an engagement platform, these applications offer ongoing personalization and hyper-personalization of EX of HRM practices at different touchpoints in the employment lifecycle. In addressing the study's overarching aim, the role of AI-assisted HRM in a firm's ecosystem reflects the strategic choices leaders exercised to retain differentiated talent groups and ensure high levels of the psychological contract between the organization and these groups. The size of Big-Tech and workforce diversity was another motivation to manage large pools of people simultaneously. Thus, the design of the PeopleXp framework by HR managers and leaders involved a careful curation and selection of AI-assisted HR applications in BigTech's digitalized HR ecosystem. The sub-aim of this article was to analyze the impact of AI-assisted HRM on EX and EE levels. This study found that Big-Tech's strategic focus helped elevate talent's EX (Malik, De Silva, et al., 2021), thus, EE, leading to improved employee commitment, retention, and business level productivity outcomes (Malik et al., 2020). BigTech's HR managers' and business leaders' choice of investing in digitalized HR platforms created a positive EX for all three underpinning horizontals of human, digital, and physical domains (Bersin et al., 2017;IBM &amp; Globoforce, 2016;Morgan, 2017;Plaskoff, 2017). The high quality of EX and personalized care through these AI applications triggered a norm of reciprocity and trust (Malik et al., 2020;Malik, De Silva, et al., 2021), resulting in better engagement, loyalty, and commitment levels. This relationship was stronger as most of the employees at BigTech were co-creators, designers, and consumers of these AI applications.

        <p>We identify several implications of our theoretical framework for theory and practice. First, we note an expanded role of HR leaders and managers as co-designers of an AI-assisted digitalized HR ecosystem of multiple HRM, EX, and engagement platforms (Breidbach et al., 2014). For HR managers to implement a new AI-assisted HR ecosystem and platforms, they must have developed digital and data science skills (Malik et al., 2020) We believe these drivers will be different for smaller firms and those not in the business of producing advanced AI-assisted applications.We identify several implications of our theoretical framework for theory and practice.

        <p>From an HR ecosystem theorization perspective, a critical point is the purpose and nature of platforms in a firm's digitalized HR ecosystem. BigTech's HR ecosystem positioned itself well to deliver high EX levels (Kim &amp; Gatling, 2018;Malik et al., 2020;Malik, De Silva, et al., 2021). In developing such an ecosystem, HR managers must cocreate applications by working collaboratively and with the direct involvement of a diverse group of stakeholders, including employees-to realize high levels of EX. Managers have an active communication role in ensuring employees have access to self-select menus with adequate flexibility in choosing a range of personalized and hyper-personalized HR solutions (Malik, De Silva, et al., 2021).From an HR ecosystem theorization perspective, a critical point is the purpose and nature of platforms in a firm's digitalized HR ecosystem.

        <p>Managers can leverage employees' skills by encouraging collaboration and knowledge sharing through traditional and AI-mediated social exchanges (Malik, Nguyen, &amp; Budhwar, 2022;Nguyen &amp; Malik, 2021, 2022). Evaluating reciprocity norms, employees assess their benefits from exceptional EX platform(s), and many work for an organizational brand that offers innovative technology-mediated exchanges (Ma &amp; Brown, 2020). Finally, the new skills and HR competencies needed by employees and HR practitioners to continue to deliver value in digitalized HR ecosystems include digital savviness, data fluency, and technology coaching.

        <p>For organizations to succeed, their internal customers (employees) must have positive EX to reciprocate it by engaging and committing to their workplace for extended periods. Benefits would accrue to organizations as their employees are more satisfied and engaged with their workplace and have a lower intention to quit. The parameters to track would be attrition, revenue, profitability, and an employer of choice brand and employee and customer satisfaction at any predetermined/Adhoc point in time. The HR professional will need to make a gradual shift from having a process-specific (generalization) expertise through deep expertise (specialization) to personal mastery (personalization) and developing sound expertise in coaching (individualization). In addition to the skills noted below, these will be part of HR leaders' and managers' new and expanded role in supporting such an ecosystem.For organizations to succeed, their internal customers (employees) must have positive EX to reciprocate it by engaging and committing to their workplace for extended periods.

In addition, HR leaders and managers will require high emotional intelligence and creativity levels, a characteristic that is not the core of automation and digitalization yet. To align HR service delivery to the realities of the changing landscape, several new possibilities of automation for HR need exploring. The efficiencies that will be realized will reduce manual efforts and allow the HR team to focus on human skills-such as relationship building, critical problem solving, strategic thinking, and innovation.Other competencies that HR practitioners will demand are digital savviness-a high technology quotient, data fluency from actionable insights, using advanced decision support systems, and undertaking an expanded coaching role.

        <p>EX, efficiency, and effectiveness are the driving forces underpinning a digitalized HR ecosystem. This will lead to leveraging automation efficiencies and evaluating effectiveness to provide individualized EX, an antecedent to EE. We also need a supportive company culture comprising collaborations, transparency, psychological safety, alignment, and sharing feedback. These elements collectively raise exit barriers and help create an ecosystem for employees to thrive and innovate. Further, looking at integrated facets rather than disparate focus areas can improve EX, characterized by personalization and individualization. Although personalization addresses the needs of personae, individualization makes it unique to an individual's needs.EX, efficiency, and effectiveness are the driving forces underpinning a digitalized HR ecosystem.

Future research may consider the role of different actors in the ecosystem and their interdependencies on the quality of the developed AIenabled applications. Further research is needed on actors' knowledge-sharing intentions and motivations when using an AImediated social exchange. This is critical as some actors in the ecosystem may be more skeptical of the advantages of an algorithmic system of AI-enabled HRM EX and EE platforms. A related question is whether such systems can create value for all actors in the ecosystem, or will only a few stand to benefit? As the boundaries between work and non-work domains become blurred, further research on managing non-work-related issues and talent on a range of employee and business outcomes is warranted (Mohamed et al., 2006). Finally, from a strategic HRM perspective, future research might be needed to evaluate the impact of disappearing HR differentiation when there is a dominant network effect of AI-based HRM and engagement systems that firms normatively adopt.

All focus is on technology. [Technology Manager] …So you have the differentiated rewards you could differentiate learning opportunities you are differentiated. [HR Manager] myTalent And you are calling out the set of people who are against whatever numbers that you may have, who are shortlisted for being given this kind of opportunity, where you get 65,000 entries for an innovation contest…in that, you are going to select the top 16 ….in that 16 your, you get your top three. So that's the level of filtration. When you come down to that, you are really quite literally 1% of the population…so literally …. "lakhon mein ek" [a Hindi expression for one in a 100,000].

        <p>AI-based applications (wherein we view this as a continuum from physical through hybrid to AI-enabled digital platforms). The resulting configuration is akin to Breidbach et al. (2014) typology of virtual engagement platforms On the other hand, the high-touch EE and HR programs have a transformational focus and continuous exchange of resources with the users, employing highly interactive, advisory, problem-solving, coaching, and complex solutions at scale. The examples from BigTech include myPhygital, myCompetency and talent Bot, and IiPA serving the hybrid or digital and AI-assisted HR platforms. At the more advanced end of the AI applications were myCompetency and talent Bot and IiPA applications, note the continuous nature of EX and EE and highlight the need to differentiate this for different groups. The ability of a human HRM function to nuance this for organizations employing a large number of people is not practical. Hence, an AI-assisted HRM infrastructure that can enable personalization, hyper-personalization, and individualization of EX to scale is likely to lead to higher levels of EE.AI-based applications (wherein we view this as a continuum from physical through hybrid to AI-enabled digital platforms).
