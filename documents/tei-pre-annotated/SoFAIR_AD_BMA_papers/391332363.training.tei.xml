        <p>This essay surveys the literature on directed search and competitive search equilibrium, covering theory and a variety of applications. These models share features with traditional search theory, but also differ in important ways. They share features with general equilibrium theory, but with explicit frictions. Equilibria are often efficient, mainly because markets price goods plus the time required to get them. The approach is tractable and arguably realistic. Results are presented for finite and continuum economies. Private information and sorting with heterogeneity are analyzed. While emphasizing issues and applications, we also provide several hard-to-find technical results.

        <p>equilibrium. While the plan in what follows is to go into considerable detail on the literature, to give a hint up front, we mention influential papers by Peters (1984Peters ( , 1991)), Montgomery (1991), Shimer (1996), and Moen (1997). 1 To be precise, for our purposes, an economic model has two components: an environment, including descriptions of the set of agents with preferences and technologies; and a mechanism or solution concept mapping environments onto outcomes. Directed search is a feature of the environment. To explain this, first note that in search theory agents are modeled as trading with each other, and often bilaterally, different from Walrasian theory, where they simply trade with (slide along) their budget lines. 2 Directed search means agents see some, although perhaps not all, characteristics of other agents, and based on that choose where to look for counterparties. This contrasts with random search, where meetings are exogenous. The characteristics of agents in most of the models described below include their posted terms of trade-generally contracts, although sometimes these are simply prices. This contrasts with traditional search models that assume agents bargain after they meet, and also with those that assume price posting when the posted terms do not influence who meets whom.equilibrium.

        <p>While directed and random search are different approaches that can be applied in single-agent decision theory, competitive search equilibrium is solution concept mapping environments into outcomes. While 1 Highlighting a few papers like this was suggested by a referee, but it is not easy to know where to draw the line. Other early related work includes Sattinger (1990) and Hosios (1990); one might also say the papers reviewed in section 5 were early and foundational; etc.While directed and random search are different approaches that can be applied in single-agent decision theory, competitive search equilibrium is solution concept mapping environments into outcomes.

        <p>2 Some search models do have Walrasian pricing, for example, Lucas and Prescott (1974) and Rocheteau and Wright (2005) in labor and goods markets, respectively, motivated by saying agents meet in large groups and not bilaterally.2 Some search models do have Walrasian pricing, for example, Lucas and Prescott (1974) and Rocheteau and Wright (2005) in labor and goods markets, respectively, motivated by saying agents meet in large groups and not bilaterally.</p>
        <p>there is not complete consensus on usage, we take a stand: competitive search equilibrium means that agents on one side of the market post the terms of trade, while agents on the other side observe what is posted and direct their search accordingly. This can be applied in environments with finite or infinite numbers of agents; the situation where these numbers are sufficiently large that certain strategic considerations can be ignored is called perfectly competitive search equilibrium.there is not complete consensus on usage, we take a stand: competitive search equilibrium means that agents on one side of the market post the terms of trade, while agents on the other side observe what is posted and direct their search accordingly.

        <p>Consider any two-sided market with, for example, buyers and sellers, firms and workers, or borrowers and lenders, trying to get together in pairs. Traditional search assumes they meet exogenously, at random, although whether a meeting results in trade can be endogenous. Directed search is different because agents use the information to target their search toward particular types, and sometimes even particular individuals. This can be based on primitive characteristics of agents-for instance, buyers can search for sellers of particular goods-and on endogenous characteristics like the posted terms of trade. In competitive search, equilibrium resources are allocated through the terms of trade plus the probability of trade. This is distinct from Walrasian theory, where trading probabilities play no role, and from traditional random search models, where prices have a relatively minor allocative role. 3 Competitive search thus integrates elements of general equilibrium (GE) theory and traditional search theory, yet is still tractable and often delivers clean results.Consider any two-sided market with, for example, buyers and sellers, firms and workers, or borrowers and lenders, trying to get together in pairs.

        <p>In contrast to what happens in [random] search models, exchanges in actual market economies are organized by specialist traders, who mitigate search costs by providing facilities that are easy to locate. Thus when people wish to buy shoes they go to a shoe store; when hungry they go to a grocer; when desiring to sell their labor services they go to firms known to offer employment. Few people would think of planning their economic lives on the basis of random encounters.In contrast to what happens in [random] search models, exchanges in actual market economies are organized by specialist traders, who mitigate search costs by providing facilities that are easy to locate.

        <p>Whether or not they realize it, while attempting to critique traditional search theory, these commentators with their pithy remarks are all describing facets of directed or competitive search. Our view is that there is a role for random matching models, with bargaining or other means for determining the terms of trade, but it is also good to know the alternatives. The models presented below provide a class of alternative that is becoming increasingly popular and has proved useful in many applications. After discussing details of the various models and applications, we will say more about the advantages and disadvantages of the alternative approaches.Whether or not they realize it, while attempting to critique traditional search theory, these commentators with their pithy remarks are all describing facets of directed or competitive search.

        <p>We present models of finite markets and limiting results for large markets. In all of these models frictions take center stage, even when the set of agents is large. In particular, some sellers can have few customers, while others have more than they need, leading to rationing, unsold inventories, the coexistence of vacancies and unemployment, etc. The theory captures a powerful idea: if you post more favorable terms, customers may come to you with a higher probability, but not necessarily with probability 1 . If a restaurant only has a certain number of tables, or a firm only wants to hire a certain number of workers, it may not be smart to go where everyone else is going. These kinds of capacity constraints play a major role in the models surveyed below, and mean that agents must consider both the terms of trade and the probability of trade. Of course capacity also matters in GE theory, but only at the market level-one cannot ask about the capacity of an agent's trading partner, because the agents trade with the market and not with each other.We present models of finite markets and limiting results for large markets.

        <p>The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 starts with static models, one framed in terms of goods and one in terms of labor markets. Section 3 embeds these in dynamic GE to discuss the time to execute trades (e.g., how long an unemployed worker or unsold house remains on the market) as well as endogenous price dispersion and stickiness. Section 4 presents applications in monetary economics, where the framework provides a very natural approach. While sections 2-4 use large numbers of agents, section 5 analyzes finite markets and then takes limits as the market gets large. Section 6 studies heterogeneity and sorting. Sections 7 and 8 consider private information and mechanism design. Sections 9 and 10 mention other topics and conclude. In general, applications that do not pique a reader's interest can be skipped without loss of continuity. As a rule of thumb, footnotes contain optional material (e.g., additional citations or technical details) and can also be skipped without loss of continuity. Appendices, as usual, can be skipped, too, but they contain some new or hard-to-find technical material that is potentially useful. 4The paper is organized as follows.

        <p>Consider a market with large numbers of two types of agents, called buyers and sellers, with measures N b and N s , and let N = N b / N s denote the population buyer/seller ratio. One can think of buyers as households or consumers and sellers as retailers, but other interpretations are possible (e.g., producers buying inputs from suppliers). There are two tradable objects. There is an indivisible good q , and sellers can produce exactly one unit at cost c ≥ 0 , while buyers want to consume exactly one unit for utility u &gt; c; and there is a divisible good x that anyone can produce at cost C ( x ) = x and consume for utility U ( x ) = x . The idea is that there are gains from trade in q , while x serves as a payment instrument that buyers use to compensate sellers. This can be interpreted as direct barter, although more typically in the literature it is called transferable utility. 5 For now each seller simply posts a price p , the amount of x buyers must pay to get q . Each buyer directs his search after observing all posted prices (all we actually need is that 4 While there is no previous survey on directed search, some surveys on labor, money, housing, and industrial organization (IO) touch on it, for example, King (2003); Rogerson, Shimer, and Wright (2005); Shi (2008); Han and Strange (2015); Lagos, Rocheteau, and Wright (2017); and Armstrong (2017).

        <p>5 Sometimes x is called money or numeraire, but that is very bad language. It should be obvious that it is not really money (below we discuss genuine money).

        <p>each buyer observes at least two prices; see Acemoglu and Autor 2016, theorem 13.4). Suppose traders meet pairwise. Thus, if a set of buyers with measure n b direct their search toward a set of sellers with measure n s , the probability a seller meets a buyer is α s = α ( n ) , where n = n b / n s is the buyer/ seller ratio, also called the queue length or market tightness. Similarly, the probability a buyer meets a seller is α b = α ( n ) / n . It is standard to assume α s = α ( n ) is increasing and concave, which implies α b = α ( n ) / n is decreasing, given the natural restriction α ( 0 ) = 0 .

        <p>To understand this, imagine any twosided market with n 1 and n 2 agents on each side, where the number of bilateral meetings between types 1 and 2 is μ = μ ( n 1 , n 2 ) . Analogous to a production function mapping inputs into output, μ is assumed to be increasing and concave, and usually to display constant returns to scale (CRS). Then α 1 = μ ( n 1 , n 2 ) / n 1 = μ ( n, 1 ) / n , where n = n 1 / n 2 , and α 2 = μ ( n 1 , n 2 ) / n 2 = μ ( n, 1 ) . This generalizes models of one- sided markets (e.g., Diamond 1982), and is more interesting because the α terms depend on tightness, even with CRS. In addition, with a two-sided specification it is natural to endogenize tightness by allowing entry by one side. For now, a buyer seeks a seller with a particular p , but whether he finds one is random (in section 5 an agent finds a counterparty for sure, but may or may not trade, due to capacity constraints).To understand this, imagine any twosided market with n 1 and n 2 agents on each side, where the number of bilateral meetings between types 1 and 2 is μ = μ ( n 1 , n 2 ) .

        <p>A set of sellers posting the same p and buyers searching for them constitutes a submarket with tightness n = n b / n s . Thus, a submarket is characterized by ( p, n ) . Buyers' and sellers' payoffs are denoted V b and V s . Sellers maximize V s by posting ( p, n ) , although it is not crucial that they post nsellers can equivalently post only p and let buyers work out the equilibrium n for themselves. In any case, for a seller to be in business, ( p, n ) must deliver to buyers their market payoff V b , which is an equilibrium object, but taken as given by individuals. This is called the market utility approach. 6 Then sellers solve the following problem:A set of sellers posting the same p and buyers searching for them constitutes a submarket with tightness n = n b / n s .

        <p>Sellers' payoff in a submarket is their trading probability times the surplus S s = pc , and buyers' payoff is their trading probability times the surplus S b = up . While a more rigorous definition of competitive search equilibrium appears in section 6, the idea is basically optimization and market clearing: sellers maximize V s subject to buyers getting V b ; and the n emerging from (1) is consistent with the set of buyers and sellers in the market. Notice sellers can get the same V s from lower p if n is higher, and buyers can get the same V b from higher p if n is lower. These trade-offs are a quintessential element of the theory.Sellers' payoff in a submarket is their trading probability times the surplus S s = pc , and buyers' payoff is their trading probability times the surplus S b = up .

The models above have those results in the special case of a Cobb-Douglas meeting technology, where ε ′ = 0 , but in general, parameters that affect ε can move trading probabilities enough to move prices in ways that are counterintuitive without understanding the theory.

        <p>Clearly the theory accommodates deviations from the law of one price. With heterogeneous buyers, sellers in submarket 1 settle for p 1 , even though others are getting p 2 &gt; p 1 , because the latter take Heterogeneous Buyers (left) or Sellers (right) longer to sell. With heterogeneous sellers, buyers in submarket 2 pay p 2 even though others are paying p 1 &lt; p 2 , for similar reasons. This is related to, yet different from, other theories of price dispersion. In Burdett and Judd (1983), for instance, buyers see a random number of prices simultaneouslycalled noisy search-and when they see more than one they pick the lowest. In equilibrium ex ante identical sellers post different prices but earn equal profits, as those with lower p earn less per unit but make it up on the volume. That is like our sellers, but Burdett-Judd buyers do not make a directed choice between paying less or trading faster the way they do here.Clearly the theory accommodates deviations from the law of one price.

        <p>Returning to heterogeneous buyers and homogeneous sellers, consider the application to housing in Rekkas, Wright, and Zhu (2017). There are a fixed number of homogeneous houses in the market, but buyers are heterogeneous, with the value to becoming a homeowner distributed continuously across buyers with cumulative distribution function (CDF) G ( u ) and support [ u 1 , u 2 ] . Now equilibrium involves a continuum of submarkets indexed by ( p u , n u ) (this is treated more formally below). Hence there is a submarket for every point on sellers' common indifference curve between ( n 1 * , p 1 * ) and ( n 2 * , p 2 * ) , with higher u associated with higher p u and lower n u . Highervaluation buyers search where their trading probabilities and prices are higher, while sellers are indifferent because listing a house at a higher price means a longer average time on the market. Of course, it is no surprise that a big home in a nice neighborhood costs more than a small one in a bad neighborhood; the interest here is in residual price dispersion, the way labor economists are interested in residual wage dispersion.Returning to heterogeneous buyers and homogeneous sellers, consider the application to housing in Rekkas, Wright, and Zhu (2017).

        <p>What may be less obvious is that the model is consistent with sticky prices. If market conditions change, the distribution reacts, but if the change is not too big the old and new supports overlap, and sellers with p in the overlapping range have no incentive to reprice. If demand falls, for example, the distribution shifts left, but many sellers can keep the same p . This is relevant because people claim house prices are sticky in the data and find it puzzling: "conventional wisdom is that traditional, rational, forward-looking economic theories are unable to explain extreme price stickiness of this sort, unless there are large menu costs" (Merlo, Ortalo-Magné, and Rust 2015). More generally, directed search is natural for understanding many aspects of housing markets. 16 Moving from houses back to generic goods, let us now make them divisible: DM buyers get a quantity or quality q in exchange for payment p in the next CM. Buyers' utility and sellers' cost, u ( q ) and c ( q ) , satisfy the usual properties, plus u ( 0 ) = c ( 0 ) = 0 and u ( q ¯ ) = c ( q ¯ ) for some q ¯ &gt; 0 . The efficient q solves u ′ ( q * ) = c ′ ( q * ) . One can call p ˆ = p / q the unit price, unless q is unobserved quality, in which case one might still call p the price. We assume both p and q are posted, although there are alternatives-, perhaps due to limited commitment, there may be a posted unit price p ˆ , and then in a meeting q is chosen unilaterally by the buyer (Peters 1984) or the seller (Gomis-Porqueras, Julien, and Wang 2017). 16 In Albrecht, Gautier, and Vroman (2016), sellers first list prices, with more attractive prices meaning more buyers show up on average (although the actual number is random, as in section 5). Each buyer can accept the listed price or make a counteroffer. If no buyers accept, the seller can accept or reject the best counteroffer. If exactly one buyer accepts, he gets the house at the listed price. If two or more accept, the seller runs an auction. This is consistent with data showing that houses can sell at, above, or below listed prices. In other applications, Diaz and Jerez (2013) build a model consistent with cyclical data. Head, Sun, and Zhou (2016) have heterogenous sellers, and highly indebted homeowners tend to list high prices and take longer to sell. Hedlund (2016) has heterogenous buyers and sellers and accounts for cyclical dynamics.

Also, simple wage contracts do not induce efficiency, similar to the model in subsection 2.2 with multiple applications. With on-the-job search, firms care about both recruitment and retention, and a single wage is not sufficient to balance the two. This is especially clear when all matches produce the same y , which means on-the-job search is rent seeking that has a social cost but does not increase output. However, more complicated contracts that directly specify search activity, or specify transfers when workers quit, can restore efficiency (Menzio and Shi 2011).To recap, there are n w wages, w 1 &lt; w 2 &lt; ⋯ &lt; w n w .

        <p>Research on labor markets with directed search is a vibrant area. As regards business cycle fluctuations, in particular, Menzio and Moen (2010) show that the optimal wage contract with aggregate productivity shocks prescribes rigid wages for existing workers and downward rigidity for new hires. Menzio and Shi (2011) exploit block recursivity to develop a tractable model of unemployment, vacancies, and job-to-job transitions over the cycle. In their model, transitions are driven by heterogeneity in firm-worker matches. They show the labor market's response to aggregate shocks is large only if the quality of the match is observed after the match is created. Schaal (2017) also uses a directed search model to study business cycles, focusing on the impact of time-varying idiosyncratic shocks at the establishment level.

        <p>As another connection between directed search and money, consider dynamics. The model sketched here has nonstationary equilibria for some parameters, where the value of the asset varies over time, as a self-fulfilling prophecy. That is also true with Nash bargaining models, but the microfoundations can be criticized in nonstationary equilibria (Coles and Wright 1998). This critique does not apply to competitive search, and so one can say it provides a more rigorous model of dynamics based on liquidity considerations (more on this in subsection 9.1). Moreover, monetary models with competitive search are important in the literature, as early work was criticized by those who dislike random matching and bargaining. It is thus good to know that most insights also apply with directed search and posting.As another connection between directed search and money, consider dynamics.

        <p>Now let agents hold any m ∈ ℝ + and bring back the frictionless CM convening after each DM. A nice feature of the CM in this kind of application is that it harnesses the distribution of m , plus it allows one to incorporate many elements of mainstream macro in search models. Yet another is that we do not have to say whether agents are buyers or sellers depending on their current m as in subsection 4.1; instead we can have some called buyers that always want to consume but cannot produce in the DM, while others called sellers produce but do not consume. This would not work with only DM trade.Now let agents hold any m ∈ ℝ + and bring back the frictionless CM convening after each DM.

As we cannot have both θ = 1 and θ = ε ( n ) , in general, bargaining is not efficient; competitive search equilibrium is efficient even with two-sided holdup problems. 20The model is generalized by Lagos and Rocheteau (2005) by fixing n = N but introducing endogenous search effort by buyers to try to capture the "hot potato" effect of inflation (people spend money faster when i is higher). As they show, this cannot happen with Nash bargaining. The reason is that i is effectively a tax on DM activity, making buyers bring less money in real terms, which lowers the gains from trade and leads to less search effort; hence, they end up spending their money slower rather than faster. With competitive search, however, even though higher i lowers the total DM surplus, it can shift the terms of trade in favor of buyers for some parameters, leading to more search effort and a "hot potato" effect..

In a quantitative application, Rocheteau and Wright (2005) compare the effects of inflation with competitive search and Nash bargaining and find it makes a big difference. 21 In Faig and Huangfu (2007), market makers post terms for their submarkets to attract buyers and sellers, as discussed above.

        <p>Now the set of equilibria in pricing can be described as follows: one possibility is p 1 = p 2 = u , γ 11 = 1 , and γ 21 = 0 (for sure buyer 1 goes to seller 1 and buyer 2 goes to seller 2 ), which is an equilibrium since buyers can do no better at this p , and sellers can never do better than this. Symmetrically, p 1 = p 2 = u , γ 11 = 0, and γ 21 = 1 is an equilibrium. Burdett, Shi, and Wright (2001) show there are also many asymmetric equilibria supported by triggers. 22 Rather than dwelling on these, let 22 Here is the idea: Pick any p such that it is an equilibirum for buyer 1 to go to seller 1 and buyer 2 to go to seller 2 for sure. If any seller deviates, let buyers play this equilibrium at stage 2 : If p 1 ≥ ( u + p 2 ) / 2 both go to seller 2 ; if p 1 ≤ 2 p 2u both go to seller 1 ; and if ( u + p 2 ) / 2 &gt; p &gt; 2 p 2u they play the mixed equilibrium. Burdett, Shi, and Wright (2001) characterize the set  such that p ∈  allows no profitable deviation. Intuitively, there is no profitable deviation that makes both buyers go to the same seller at stage 2 , and it is not easy to find a profitable deviation that leads to a mixed equilibrium at stage 2 , because sellers do poorly in mixed equilibria. For any p such that profits are not too low, no one wants to deviate us focus on symmetric mixed-strategy equilibria, as in much of the literature. This can be motivated by arguing that pure strategies rely on a lot of coordination, which may be reasonable in a 2 × 2 market, but is less so in large markets (Bland andLoertscher 2012, Norman 2016).Now the set of equilibria in pricing can be described as follows: one possibility is p 1 = p 2 = u , γ 11 = 1 , and γ 21 = 0 (for sure buyer 1 goes to seller 1 and buyer 2 goes to seller 2 ), which is an equilibrium since buyers can do no better at this p , and sellers can never do better than this.

Intuitively, there is no profitable deviation that makes both buyers go to the same seller at stage 2 , and it is not easy to find a profitable deviation that leads to a mixed equilibrium at stage 2 , because sellers do poorly in mixed equilibria. For any p such that profits are not too low, no one wants to deviate us focus on symmetric mixed-strategy equilibria, as in much of the literature. This can be motivated by arguing that pure strategies rely on a lot of coordination, which may be reasonable in a 2 × 2 market, but is less so in large markets (Bland andLoertscher 2012, Norman 2016).</p>

        <p>In this equilibrium, half the time both buyers visit the same seller, so one buyer and seller do not trade: as in Lagos (2000), simultaneously some buyers do not get served and some sellers have no customers. In fact, μ = 3 / 2 is the expected number of trades, which is inefficient in the sense that μ = 2 is physically feasible. Yet in another sense it is fairly good. Suppose both buyers go to seller 1 with arbitrary probability γ . Then the chance they both go to the same seller is γ 2 + ( 1 -γ ) 2 , which is min- imized at γ = 1 / 2 . Also, while the total expected surplus is not maximized, buyers like this equilibrium because V b = V s = and trigger mixing at stage 2 .

        <p>Coles and Eeckhout (2003) integrate the approaches by letting sellers post p contingent on the number of buyers that show up, say p Q ( Q for queue length). This nests pure posting with p 1 = p 2 , and auctions with p 2 = p ¯ = u and p 1 = p ¯ . They show there is an equilibrium with p 1 = p 2 = ( u + c ) / 2 , as in the baseline model, but there are many others as well, all with p 1 = ( u + c ) / 2 , and any p 2 ∈ [ c, u ] . They are not payoff equivalent, and profit is highest with auctions. To see why, note first that a seller is indifferent to posting any pair ( p 1 , p 2 ) delivering V b to buyers, but not indifferent to his rival's posting. Suppose, for example, a seller lowers his p to increase the probability that customers come to him. That decreases the probability that they go to his rival, so if they go to his rival they are more likely to get p 1 and less likely to get p 2 . Ergo, stealing business is harder, and as a result profit is higher, when sellers post p 1 &lt; p 2 rather than p 1 = p 2 .Coles and Eeckhout (2003) integrate the approaches by letting sellers post p contingent on the number of buyers that show up, say p Q ( Q for queue length).

        <p>An exceptional case is the Coles-Eeckhout equilibrium where p 2 = c is at its minimum value. In this equilibrium a buyer gets the same expected payoff, ( u -c ) / 2 , whether or not the other one shows up, with the expectation taken before it is determined who gets the good if both show up.

        <p>Several remarks are in order. First, (45) endogenously gives p as a weighted average of c and u , which might not be apparent from Burdett, Shi, and Wright (2001) because they normalize u = 1 and c = 0 . In fact, the weight on u is the probability a seller gets at least 2 buyers, and the weight on c is the probability he gets just 1 . Second, as in the 2 × 2 game, in equilibrium buyers visit sellers at random, but the fact that search can be directed still disciplines prices. Third, notice that p is a smooth function of n b and n s , which we think is nice. To say why, let n s be large, and note that as n b goes from n s -1 to n s + 1 , frictionless equilibrium theory predicts p jumps from c to u . As shown in figure 5, with competitive search the discrete jump gets smoothed out by the frictions, which is one reason Peters (1984Peters ( , 1991) ) and others advocated the approach in the first place.Several remarks are in order.

Finally, while we appeal to Galenianos and Kircher (2012) to claim uniqueness with homogeneous sellers, Kim and Camera 24 From this it should be evident that it can matter who posts and who searches in finite markets, since throwing n b balls into n s urns is not the same as throwing n s balls into n b urns (Kultti 2000;Halko, Kultti, and Virrankoski 2008). Indeed, it matters even when n b , n s → ∞ , where (based on proposition 6 below) the number of matches Shi and Delacroix (2018) point out, in this case, μ s &gt; μ b if and only if n s &lt; n b , and hence we generate more meetings when the short side posts.

        <p>The above methods allow us to determine p without an exogenous bargaining solution, and to determine α s and α b without an exogenous meeting technology. While this is attractive, we keep an open mind. For the terms of trade, bargaining better captures situations without commitment and hence with holdup problems. For the trading probabilities, ( 55) is a special case of models where α s and α b come from a general meeting technology, which is relevant empirically to the extent that urn-ball functions can perform poorly when confronted with data (Petrongolo and Pissarides 2001).

        <p>Having said that, a clear advantage to finite numbers concerns off-equilibrium beliefs: all we need is subgame perfection. With a continuum, however, things get tricky. Given a candidate equilibrium p , if one seller from a continuum deviates, what is the best response of buyers? If the deviator is measure 0 there is no response. The market utility approach skirts this issue in a way that is not entirely satisfactory. As an alternative, Galenianos and Kircher (2009) posit a set of artificial sellers with measure δ that exogenously post every p in the relevant range. They then properly evaluate deviation payoffs for δ &gt; 0 , and focus on equilibria that obtain when δ → 0 . This works, but is slightly cumbersome.Having said that, a clear advantage to finite numbers concerns off-equilibrium beliefs: all we need is subgame perfection.

The last term leads to higher equilibrium prices: if a firm contemplates reducing its price, it understands that the additional customers it attracts reduce congestion at its competitors, which makes the competitors endogenously more attractive. This can lead to inefficiency if we add entry or heterogeneity. 25 Norman (2016) offers another approach, based on population uncertainty (Myerson 1998(Myerson , 2000)). Suppose n b and n s are independently drawn from Poisson distributions, where sellers do not see the realization, while buyers see n s and prices when they choose search strategies. This justifies the usual focus on symmetric equilibrium, where buyers use mixed strategies, since he shows any equilibrium is payoff equivalent to that (thus eliminating the other equilibria mentioned in footnote 22). The Poisson assumption makes the model tractable. Also, this model belongs to a general class in which prices are strategic complements, which implies there is a unique equilibrium if there is a unique symmetric equilibrium. In addition, as usual, since n b , n s → ∞ his outcome approaches our benchmark results.

First, he shows sellers' profits are strictly concave in the relevant range. Then he shows his reduced-form game is supermodular under more general conditions than previous authors. This is useful because supermodular games have a smallest and largest equilibrium, and the existence of pure strategy equilibrium is simple. Because profit is strictly concave, mixed strategies by sellers are ruled out. He also provides a simple test for uniqueness with symmetric sellers. sellers with different capacity: n 1 of them have one unit for sale; n 2 have two units; and n s = n 1 + 2 n 2 is the total quantity on the market.

        <p>Intuitively, the coordination friction is worse when there are more sellers with one unit and fewer with two , holding n s constant. In a labor application, this helps account for a changing Beveridge curve in the data, as the relationship between unemployment and total vacancies shifts with the mix of big and small firms. Lester (2010) extends this by letting firms choose how many positions to open, and studies the implications of various shocks, depending on whether job creation occurs via entry by new firms or expansion by existing firms (see also Tan 2012, Li and Tian 2013, Kultti and Mauring 2014, and Godenhielm and Kultti 2015).Intuitively, the coordination friction is worse when there are more sellers with one unit and fewer with two , holding n s constant.

He also has entry by sellers. In a large market, equilibrium can have two types of sellers: local shops that post low prices to attract the informed; and tourist shops that exploit the uninformed. However, if the fraction of informed buyers is high, no tourist shops open. He also analyzes finite markets, but only under a parameter restriction that guarantees no tourist shops open, so only one price is posted.

        <p>The setup is useful for studying changes in information. Lester (2011) shows that increasing the fraction of informed buyers can increase or decrease prices, depending on parameters. This is contrary to conventional wisdom and to several papers that say prices fall when consumers are better informed (Salop and Stiglitz 1977, Varian 1980, Burdett and Judd 1983, Stahl 1989). However, his result requires finite numbers, as the fraction of informed buyers does not affect prices with a continuum. Gomis-Porqueras, Julien, and Wang (2017) pursue this when the number of informed buyers is endogenized by costly advertising. They show more information can raise prices even in large markets. Bethune, Choi, and Wright (2020) also show more information can raise or lower prices in large markets in monetary economies. Intuitively, if buyers' bargaining power is low at tourist shops, they get more from a marginal dollar at local shops. With better information, the fraction of local shops rises, so buyers bring more money, and then sellers raise prices. 27 Let us now return to Coles and Eeckhout (2003), by allowing sellers to post p Q where Q is the number of buyers that show up.

        <p>27 This is relevant because Ellison and Ellison (2005), for example, say "evidence from the Internet … challenged the existing search models, because we did not see the tremendous decrease in prices and price dispersion that many had predicted." Similarly, according to Baye, Morgan, and Scholten (2006), "Reductions in information costs over the past century have neither reduced nor eliminated the levels of price dispersion observed." As the discussion in the text indicates, not all search models predict that prices fall with information, and it is even more obvious that price dispersion need not fall with information: when the fraction of informed buyers is 0 or 1 , we are in a pure random or directed search world, and there is no dispersion; when the fraction is between 0 and 1 there is price dispersion; so dispersion is non-monotone in information.27 This is relevant because Ellison and Ellison (2005), for example, say "evidence from the Internet … challenged the existing search models, because we did not see the tremendous decrease in prices and price dispersion that many had predicted."

        <p>In fact, posting a contingent p Q is still restrictive-why can't buyers make or receive transfers even if they do not get served? Again, one might make assumptions to preclude this, but suppose we allow it. As in Jacquet and Tan (2012), for any mechanism in a general class, the outcome can be implemented by having a buyer who gets the good pay p and having others that show up pay ϕ , which can be positive or negative. If ϕ = pu then buyers are fully insured: their payoff is the same whether or not they get served. Jacquet and Tan (2012) show that when buyers are risk averse there is a unique equilibrium and it features full insurance, ϕ = pu . One might say this provides strategic foundation for the market utility approach.In fact, posting a contingent p Q is still restrictive-why can't buyers make or receive transfers even if they do not get served?

        <p>Returning to risk neutrality, Geromichalos (2012) explores several additional extensions in n b × n s markets. First, he gives sellers the capacity to each serve up to κ customers, and post mechanisms announcing the number they will serve, which cannot exceed κ but could be less. He also allows p Q to be contingent on the queue of buyers that show up, and allows payments from those who get served and those who do not. As in the previous paragraph, it suffices to consider mechanisms where buyers that get served pay p while buyers that show up but do not get served pay ϕ . He then shows that in a particular sense, this does not matter in large markets-it is payoff equivalent to have sellers simply post one price, as in the baseline model.Returning to risk neutrality, Geromichalos (2012) explores several additional extensions in n b × n s markets.

        <p>Geromichalos ( 2014) is a sequel on the Bertrand paradox-the idea that duopoly models often have an equilibrium where price equals marginal cost (which one might expect to require many sellers). A potential resolution discussed in the literature involves capacity constraints: if a firm cannot meet market demand, a rival charging more can still get customers. He argues that this is a special case of the idea that buyers' payoffs can fall with realized demand at a given location, and considers three examples: capacity constraints, congestion effects, and prices that depend on Q (as in Coles and Eeckhout 2003). These all resolve the paradox by making buyer payoffs at a seller's location fall with the number of buyers, so they may not all go to a seller when his p is lower. While other papers typically specify demand exogenously, in directed search it is endogenous as a function of strategic behavior.Geromichalos ( 2014) is a sequel on the Bertrand paradox-the idea that duopoly models often have an equilibrium where price equals marginal cost (which one might expect to require many sellers).

It simply extends the idea of a ratio if we have finite measures of types at a given s and extends it to environments where one obtains a mass of agents only if one integrates over markets. Since it is never optimal to post an s that attracts no one, we assume supp ( n 1 (s) ) is a subset of supp ( n 2 (s) ) , where supp ( n 1 (s) ) is the support of n i , and this makes the Radon-Nikodym derivative well defined.In sum, in addition to his own type, an agent cares about these objects in a submarket: the probability of trade, the distribution of types on the other side, and payoffs within matches.

But they trade with higher types on side 2, and this cancels the effect. The general relationship between prices and probabilities can be complex. When either the type distributions or the payoff functions are not symmetric, the queue length changes according to differential equations derived from the FOC and feasibility, which capture both the relative scarcity of types and the relative importance in value generation.

Since both can be varied at the same time, it is easy to get higher prices associated with higher trading probabilities when types are heterogeneous.This setup has been studied in Shi (2001) for urn-ball matching and in Eeckhout and Kircher (2010 b ) for general matching. 32 A general treatment is provided in Chade, Eeckhout, and Smith (2017).

        <p>This discussion relies on higher types trading with each other.

Notice the second one requires maximization on and off equilibrium: if a buyer expects a seller of a given type to search for a given contract, even off equilibrium, it must be weakly optimal for that seller to do so. This delivers uniqueness. In contrast to subsection 7.1, we must specify feasibility here because entry of buyers alone is not sufficient to ensure the right market tightness per type.

        <p>As might be expected with adverse selection (e.g., based on Mirrlees 1971), individual rationality is binding for low-quality sellers, incentive compatibility is binding for high-quality sellers, and equilibrium features less trade in the submarket with high quality. Equilibrium is not generally efficient, although taxes can correct the inefficiencies (Davoodalhosseini 2019). Guerrieri and Shimer (2014) study dynamic markets with heterogenous assets. Intuitively, by selling in a "less liquid" market, sellers convey that their assets have higher value. They use the setup to analyze financial crises, fire sales, and flight to quality. Guerrieri and Shimer (2018) introduce another dimension of private information, albeit in a static setting. Namely, investors do not know the quality of assets nor the impatience of sellers. This generates multiple equilibria with interesting efficiency implications. Chang (2018) also analyzes a model with two dimensions of private information, but collapses them into one, avoiding multiple equilibria. She covers the case where assets that are more valuable to buyers do not necessarily have higher average quality, generating semi-pooling equilibria.As might be expected with adverse selection (e.g., based on Mirrlees 1971), individual rationality is binding for low-quality sellers, incentive compatibility is binding for high-quality sellers, and equilibrium features less trade in the submarket with high quality.

Intuitively, by selling in a "less liquid" market, sellers convey that their assets have higher value. They use the setup to analyze financial crises, fire sales, and flight to quality. Guerrieri and Shimer (2018) introduce another dimension of private information, albeit in a static setting. Namely, investors do not know the quality of assets nor the impatience of sellers. This generates multiple equilibria with interesting efficiency implications. Chang (2018) also analyzes a model with two dimensions of private information, but collapses them into one, avoiding multiple equilibria. She covers the case where assets that are more valuable to buyers do not necessarily have higher average quality, generating semi-pooling equilibria.</p>
        <p>These papers study screening, as the uninformed post contracts. Delacroix and Shi (2013) study signaling. Davoodalhosseini (2012) has private information, where some buyers are informed and others are not (as in random search models going back to Williamson and Wright 1994). Directed search is a promising approach to information frictions in labor, asset, and other markets, and more research on both with screening and signaling would be welcome. Especially for asset markets, this could connect well with the theories of liquidity in section 4.These papers study screening, as the uninformed post contracts.

        <p>We now merge individual-and match-specific private information, focusing mostly on one-sided heterogeneity. There is a distribution N 2 ( t 2 ) with support [ 0, t ¯ 2 ] on side 2, and a mass N 1 of homogeneous agents on side 1, again with side 1 called sellers and side 2 buyers. Since types only refer to buyers, we sometimes drop the subscript. We also stick to private valuations: the value from a match is S 2 ( t ) = t &gt; 0 for buyers and S 1 ( t ) = 0 for sellers. A buyer's type t is private information, and we focus on sellers using mechanisms that do not specify types, like auctions. In this environment the literature is mainly concerned with the case where payoffs can be replicated using direct revelation mechanisms: in a meeting, the buyer reports t and payoffs are delivered as a function of the report. 37Here is the issue: with bilateral meetings, it is standard that sellers do not need to post anything more than a price (e.g., Riley and Zeckhauser 1983); with multilateral meetings, under mild assumptions a seller should run an auction with reserve price p ¯ that generally depends on the type distribution. A priori one might think it is inefficient if sellers extract rents via reserve prices, since it is possible that all the buyers that show up have t &gt; 0 but t &lt; p ¯ . Are there gains from trade left on the table? Extracting rents via standard price posting, as in previous sections, does not resolve this because it does not generally deliver the good to the buyer with highest valuation. In fact, the results depend on how agents meet. With random matching p ¯ &gt; 0 would be the seller's revenue-maximizing choice, which reduces to the well-studied problem of a monopolist seller.We now merge individual-and match-specific private information, focusing mostly on one-sided heterogeneity.

        <p>In McAfee (1993), Peters (1997a), and Peters and Severinov (1997), each buyer directs his search toward mechanisms they most prefer, with multilateral meetings and coordination frictions as in section 5. Given n , with probability P 0 ( n ) = e -n a seller gets no buyers, with probability P 1 ( n ) = n e -n he gets one, and with l buyers P l ( n ) follows the Poisson formula (note the multilateral nature of meetings sets this apart from section 7). They show that restricting attention to standard auctions with reserve prices is without loss of generality for an individual seller, independent of the mechanisms posted by others. Hence we have sellers use auctions with reserve prices, and refer to the mechanism by p ¯ , with no further actions by sellers. Using the notation from section 6, for each buyer let a 2 be his bid. In a first price auction, his payoff conditional on trading is v 2 ( s, a 2 , t ) = t -a 2 , and the seller's payoff is v 1 ( s, a 2 , t ) = a 2 if a 2 ≥ p ¯ as specified in s , and the payoff from no trade is 0 . Now ϕ 2 ( t, a 2 ; p ¯ ) is the probability a buyer who directs his search to p ¯ has a type weakly below t and bids weakly less than a 2 .

There are two cases: (i) buyers draw value t before deciding where to search, or (ii) they draw t after meeting a seller. In equilibrium, in the limit as the market gets large, case (i) implies sellers post a reserve price equal to their outside option, p ¯ = 0 . This validates the finding in McAfee (1993), who considers a finite economy but ignores market power, as discussed in section 5.

        <p>The main driving force behind Peters and Severinov's argument for case (i) is illustrated as follows: Suppose all sellers offer the same p ¯ &gt; 0 . Then any seller trades with probability less than 1 due to frictions. Now a deviating seller posting p ¯ -ε attracts additional buyers, those with type above p ¯ -ε for whom the original p ¯ is too high. In a large market the deviant seller's trading probability jumps, since there are many such buyers, making the deviation profitable. Hence, the only possibility in a large market is p ¯ = 0 . Despite the fact that search is directed, in equilibrium all offers are identical and buyers pick sellers at random. This coincides with the planner's outcome, since the most trade occurs if buyers visit sellers at random, if the good goes to the highest type, without precluding anyone outright from the market. Interestingly, even though in case (i) there is ex ante information that can be used when selecting where to search, the efficient equilibrium outcome (random search and where the good goes to the highest bidder) does not use that information. Thus, even in the less informative case (ii) the same outcome occurs. Competitive search is efficient, independent of when types are drawn, which is especially nice because the efficient mechanism is so simple, with p ¯ not depending on the distribution of t .The main driving force behind Peters and Severinov's argument for case (i) is illustrated as follows: Suppose all sellers offer the same p ¯ &gt; 0 .

        <p>The randomness of search here contrasts with section 7, but this can be explained with two types: high types outbid low types and for them, random search maximizes the number of matches, due to the well-know concavity of the urn-ball matching function. Similarly, random search maximizes the total number of matches of all types. Therefore, total efficiency is achieved (see also subsection 8.2). When sellers are heterogeneous in costs and buyers know their type before searching, search is no longer random. Rather, higher-type buyers choose a higher cost cutoff seller and trade randomly with all types where costs are better. Higher buyer types have a higher cutoff, meaning negative sorting (Peters 1997 a ), similar to subsection 6.2, but now sorting is imperfect because a buyer not only trades with the cutoff seller but with all higher types. This corresponds to the planner's outcome where the chance of trading is increased by spreading these buyers across sellers.The randomness of search here contrasts with section 7, but this can be explained with two types: high types outbid low types and for them, random search maximizes the number of matches, due to the well-know concavity of the urn-ball matching function.

        <p>The result obtains whether buyers only observe the reserve price, or also seller type, since given p ¯ they do not care about the latter. It also obtains if they cannot see p ¯ , given a penalty for lying. Sellers accept the highest bid unless it is below cost, and buyers do not submit bids below cost. Effectively this is like a first-price auction with reserve price equal to cost (Julien, Kennes, and King 2005). Finally, even if there is no penalty for lying, and messages are cheap talk, there is an equilibrium where sellers truthfully reveal type (Kim and Kircher 2015). 39 This highlights the role of cheap talk without commitment, as in housing and labor markets where advertised prices and wages may send messages but are typically not binding (Albrecht, Gautier, and Vroman 2016).

        <p>with private information or with observable types are identical: Shi (2002) and Shimer (2005) study settings in which sellers post a price and priority rule for each type and find that mixing types in a submarket is a robust outcome with urn-ball matching. They also study two-sided heterogeneity. Mangin (2017) considers the relationship between workers' endogenous share of the surplus and the endogenous production technology in a competitive search model with wages determined by auctions. Expected match output depends on tightness through a selection channel and a generalized Hosios condition for efficiency applies. Workers' share of the surplus depends not only on tightness, and hence general economic conditions, but also depends directly on the distribution of match-specific productivities-the type distribution. In the limit as unemployment disappears, Mangin shows the firms' share converges to the tail index of this distribution, which captures the fatness of its tails. The key parameter governing the surplus division is thus inherited from this distribution. Thus, competitive search delivers a deeper foundation for the link between factor prices and technology, which is simply assumed with competitive factor markets. Mangin and Julien (2021) show that the generalized Hosios condition applies in several other settings where the surplus depends on tightness, explaining the efficiency results in Albrecht, Gautier, and Vroman (2014).with private information or with observable types are identical: Shi (2002) and Shimer (2005) study settings in which sellers post a price and priority rule for each type and find that mixing types in a submarket is a robust outcome with urn-ball matching.

        <p>With adverse selection, efficiency can fail if types are not observable. The inefficiencies can be reduced and market outcomes improved by restricting sellers to post prices (or equivalently, randomly choosing one buyer to trade with) relative to a market with full commitment power (Gottardi, Tallon, and Ghirardato 2017). Kennes and Schiff (2008) assume sellers have private information about the quality of their goods and multilateral meetings. An intermediary verifying quality sells information to buyers and sells accreditation to sellers. This can be welfare improving or reducing. Again, there is more to do in this area. Julien and Roger (2016) introduce moral hazard, assuming a stochastic relationship between output and unobserved effort in with risk aversion but not limited liability (unlike Moen and Rosén 2011). The unique equilibrium contract does not depend on the number of agents who show up and they get constrained efficiency on the intensive (effort) and extensive (entry) margins, given they allow transfers to agents who show up but are not selected, as in Jacquet and Tan (2012). Other work includes Lester, Visschers, and Wolthoff (2017), where sellers compete on posted asking prices and agents can trade immediately or wait for an auction, like on eBay, combining elements of optimal stopping models and competitive search.With adverse selection, efficiency can fail if types are not observable.

        <p>There is a literature on mechanism design and auctions where competition for buyers is a nontrivial element, but less work on how the meeting process matters. In the private valuation case, with multilateral meetings, we saw competition for buyers results in a standard auction with reserve price equal to cost. This is simple, but raises concerns: why don't sellers use two margins, one to attract buyers and one to guarantee that buyers who show up reveal their types? Why does competition stop at p ¯ = 0 price, rather than p ¯ &lt; 0 , which attracts even more buyers? Should there be an entry payment to attract buyers and a reserve price to select the best type?

        <p>The general issue is to know how mechanism design is affected by the way agents meet. While this has not attracted much attention yet, we can review some advances in settings with ex ante private values for buyers as introduced at the beginning of the previous subsection ( S 2 ( t ) = t and S 1 ( t ) = 0, where buyer type t is distrib- uted on [ 0, 1 ] ). But in contrast to this subsection, consider now a general meeting function P l ( n ) instead of urn ball, follow- ing Eeckhout and Kircher (2010a); Lester, Visschers, and Wolthoff (2015); and Cai, Gautier, andWolthoff (2017, 2019). This is natural, for example, if each buyer approaches one seller but the latter seller only has time to deal with a random subset of L buyers. If L = 1 , this is a bilateral meeting technology; if L = ∞ it is urn-ball; and other intermediate cases may be equally plausible.The general issue is to know how mechanism design is affected by the way agents meet.

        <p>To see how this affects the mechanism choice, as in Cai, Gautier, andWolthoff (2017, 2019), two observations are relevant: First, posting an optimal entry payment and a standard auction with a reserve price is at least as profitable as any direct revelation mechanism, so we can focus on a second price auction where buyers pay an entry fee and then bid. Second, equilibrium is constrained efficient, which means the reserve price equals cost, and the surplus added across sellers is maximized.

        <p>Suppose sellers can handle up to L buyers, where the resulting ζ is not globally concave for L &lt; ∞ , and the lack of concavity is more severe for small L . Eeckhout and Kircher (2010 a ) show more constrained sellers want to segregate buyer types into different submarkets, and since they can then infer type there is no need for complicated mechanisms (see also Auster and Gottardi 2019). However, to ensure simple price posting is optimal for any distribution of buyer types we need bilateral meetings-see Cai, Gautier, andWolthoff (2017, 2019), who also show it is optimal for a seller that attracts n to post auctions with a reserve price equal to cost and an entry fee τ . One can show τ = 0 if ζ 2 = 0 everywhere, a feature called invariance (Lester et al. 2019). When this applies, it is optimal to pool, as competition between types is handled by the mechanism rather than meetings. In sum, the meeting process has many implications for mechanism choice, and we encourage more work on this. 9.

However, to ensure simple price posting is optimal for any distribution of buyer types we need bilateral meetings-see Cai, Gautier, andWolthoff (2017, 2019), who also show it is optimal for a seller that attracts n to post auctions with a reserve price equal to cost and an entry fee τ . One can show τ = 0 if ζ 2 = 0 everywhere, a feature called invariance (Lester et al. 2019). When this applies, it is optimal to pool, as competition between types is handled by the mechanism rather than meetings. In sum, the meeting process has many implications for mechanism choice, and we encourage more work on this. 9. Other Topics</p>
        <p>The quest for strategic foundations for axiomatic bargaining is dubbed the Nash program (Binmore 1987). 40 Competitive search provides an explicit description of a market, with finite or infinite numbers, where traders end up sharing the gains from trade in a way that can be interpreted in terms of generalized Nash, with bargaining powers and threat points determined by economic conditions. In an n b × n s market, (45) gives p as a weighted average of c and u , where the weight on u is the probability a seller gets at least 2 buyers; in particular, in a 2 × 2 market p = ( u + c ) / 2 is consistent with the original Nash solution. This provides an alternative to showing how generalized Nash is the limit of a non-cooperative game, with bargaining power and threat points determined by details of the game (Binmore, Rubinstein, and Wolinsky 1986).The quest for strategic foundations for axiomatic bargaining is dubbed the Nash program (Binmore 1987). 40 Competitive search provides an explicit description of a market, with finite or infinite numbers, where traders end up sharing the gains from trade in a way that can be interpreted in terms of generalized Nash, with bargaining powers and threat points determined by economic conditions.

        <p>With axiomatic bargaining the parameter θ is structural. With competitive search the surplus shares are not generally constant, but depend on economic conditions. Ignoring that can be justified only in special casesfor instance, Cobb-Douglas matching. Also, the shares generally vary across submarkets, which is important, because in markets with two-sided investments typically there is no single θ that delivers efficiency (i.e., we 40 "[ As in] the microfoundations of macroeconomics, which aim to bring closer the two branches of economic theory, the Nash program is an attempt to bridge the gap between the two counterparts of game theory (cooperative and non-cooperative). This is accomplished by investigating non-cooperative procedures that yield cooperative solutions as equilibrium outcomes" (Serrano 2005). cannot satisfy multiple Hosios conditions with a one θ ). With heterogeneity, when the expected surplus depends on market tightness as in Mangin (2017) or Mangin and Julien (2021), agents' share depends not only on tightness, but also on the type distribution. Competitive search allows agents to trade prices against both probabilities of trade and the expected surplus, ensuring agents receive a share that is commensurate with their contribution to both matching and surplus creation. Thus generating efficiency. Hence, competitive search can deliver efficiency in these situations, so it not only provides microfoundations for sharing, it can dominate bargaining, but of course, this typically requires commitment.With axiomatic bargaining the parameter θ is structural.

        <p>Most of the literature on labor search, directed or otherwise, concentrates on jobs rather than firms: each job is considered an entity unto itself without specifying how they aggregate into firms. This is ill-suited for studying firm size or growth. Davis, Faberman, and Haltiwanger (2013) show that matching efficiency varies substantially, and linearly, with a firm's growth rate. To understand this, a promising avenue is to postulate that firms with L workers produce f ( L ) , and can post v vacancies at cost k ( v ) , generalizing formulations where they pay k to post v = 1 . At the level of an individual vacancy the model is unchanged, but aggregation differs, and if f is strictly concave or k strictly convex, firms grow to a finite endogenous size. Hawkins (2013) presents such a model with finite numbers, which is complicated; most subsequent work assumes that a firm posting v vacancies gets a deterministic number of hires.Most of the literature on labor search, directed or otherwise, concentrates on jobs rather than firms: each job is considered an entity unto itself without specifying how they aggregate into firms.

In any period, a firm can post one or more vacancies and may loose one or more workers, and may temporarily shut down if there is a minimum number necessary to operate profitably. The optimal size of a firm/team depends on the extent of frictions. Also, complementarity between workers in a team leads to wage dispersion, suggesting that recent emphasis on team production by human resource managers can contribute to inequality. This all suggests that endogenous firm size is an interesting area for future research.Also, they decentralize the planner's problem, in contrast to many models with multi-worker bargaining (Stole and Zwiebel 1996;Smith 1999;Brügemann, Gautier, and Menzio 2019).

        <p>There are several approaches to assessing directed search. Some use observational data (Faberman and Menzio 2018, Marinescu and Wolthoff 2020, Banfi and Villena-Roldán 2019), while others use data from field experiments (Dal Bo, Finan, and Rossi 2013;Belot, Kircher, and Muller 2016), to see if higher wages attract more or better job applicants. This seems to be the case if one takes care that jobs are sufficiently comparable. Laboratory experiments have been used to establish that participants indeed seem to randomize as predicted by the directed search micro-foundations (Cason and Noussair 2007;Anbarci and Feltovich 2013;Helland, Moen, and Preugschat 2017;Kloosterman 2016). 41 The jury is still out on which dimensions the directed search approach might fail, in general, or fail relative to random search. Engelhardt and Rupert (2017), in a calibration exercise, compares competitive search to random search and largely rejects the implications of a simple competitive search model, although they fail to reject directed search with heterogeneous workers. Calibrations that use directed search without a clear comparison to random search abound, and their success seems to indicate that this model is able to address a variety of relevant issues. 9.4 Miscellany Lester, Rocheteau, and Weill (2015) study over-the-counter financial markets in a version of Duffie, Garleanu, and Pedersen (2005) with directed search. Watanabe (2010Watanabe ( , 2020) ) considers directed search in a model of middlemen with large inventories, so they are less likely to stock out; in particular, if two firms were to merge, then if one gets two customers and the other zero , and if they can share them, it would a profitable venture. A related paper is Gautier, Ho, and Watanabe (2016), who use directed search to analyze two types of middleman, those who hold inventories they get from sellers to retrade to buyers 41 Other work explores how the current wage affects the future wages when searching on the job (Gødoy and Moen 2011) or how unemployment insurance affects search (Braun et al. 2016), which seems to indicate spillovers consistent with directed search. Other work focuses on how wages differ across employment spells (Li, Peters, and Xu 201 3 , 2015 ). and those who offer platforms for buyers and sellers to trade. Gonzalez and Shi (2010) study differences in worker arrival rates that are unknown but learned over time. This pioneers new ways to analyze dynamic markets.

        <p>Several papers study risk aversion and unemployment insurance, including Acemoglu and Shimer (1999 a ); Rudanko (2009Rudanko ( , 2011)); Golosov, Maziero, and Menzio (2013);and Geromichalos (2015). In Geromichalos (2015), workers that do not match receive b from the government, financed by a lump sum tax. This makes it cheap for firms to be aggressive in posting, as their competitors all contribute to the unemployment caused by attracting more workers than they hire. In equilibrium, wages are too high and entry is too low, but this can be corrected by experience rating, of if firms can post contracts as in Jacquet and Tan (2012). Golosov, Maziero, and Menzio (2013) study optimal unemployment insurance, and show it is optimal to insure workers against the risk of not getting hired, but not to redistribute across workers applying to different types of jobs. Herkenhoff (2019) and Herkenhoff, Phillips, and Cohen-Cole (2016) explore with risk aversion how extended credit access can provide insurance akin to unemployment insurance, and how this affects job search, job creation, and business cycle dynamics.

        <p>This completes our tour through the theory and applications of directed search (a decision-theoretic concept) and competitive search equilibrium (a solution concept). The framework contributes to our understanding of many phenomena, like traditional search theory, but in competitive search equilibrium the terms of trade are posted and agents target counterparties. Thus, prices have an allocative role, because those posting the terms compete for customers. This internalizes search externalities, and therefore often leads to efficiency. While this general message is well established, it is not always obvious what it means. With homogeneous workers, for example, it usually suffices for firms to post a single wage, but that is not the case when workers can apply to multiple firms, or when workers are risk averse.This completes our tour through the theory and applications of directed search (a decision-theoretic concept) and competitive search equilibrium (a solution concept).

        <p>Directed and random search each have advantages and disadvantages. First, competitive search equilibrium may appeal to those who have philosophical issues with random matching, and the idea that traders cannot influence who they meet by their terms of trade (recall the Introduction). Also, it tends to be tractable in analyzing with otherwise difficult problems. With heterogeneity, for instance, agents may sort into submarkets, so they know in equilibrium what type they meet and that simplifies things a lot. With entry, we often get block recursivity, which is quite useful for studying, for instance, on-the-job search and firm dynamics. Moreover, since competition and efficiency emerge naturally in benchmark models, this provides a good platform for introducing complications like moral hazard.Directed and random search each have advantages and disadvantages.

        <p>Directed search also has disadvantages. In some versions, it looks like those who direct their search can target very specific types but are not sure to actually meet them. Another strong assumption is commitment to the posted terms of trade. Without that, random search and bargaining sometimes yield interesting and arguably realistic inefficiencies absent from competitive search models. Also, the tractability of directed search due to segmentation into homogeneous submarkets is counterfactual in some contexts, although more sophisticated models can have heterogeneity in a given submarket. Further, random search is sometimes easier because one does not have to determine submarkets endogenously. One can also say that directed search assumes agents know rather a lot, while random search assumes they know very little, and reality is somewhere in between. As mentioned, there are attempts to study intermediate cases, and this seems promising.Directed search also has disadvantages.

        <p>Competitive search is a tractable and natural way to model competition among contracts and makes it relatively straightforward to study both finite markets and limiting large markets. Again, the theory captures the idea that if you post more favorable terms potential customers come to you with higher probability, but not generally with probability 1 . Agents on both sides of the market take into account prices and trading probabilities, a generalization of standard GE theory. In particular, with homogeneous buyers and sellers the price and probability of trade are the same everywhere, but the option to post different terms, and to search differently, disciplines equilibrium behavior. For these reasons and more, the framework is extremely useful, and its future seems bright. We hope this essay inspires readers to learn more about it and to continue contributing to its development.Competitive search is a tractable and natural way to model competition among contracts and makes it relatively straightforward to study both finite markets and limiting large markets.

This implies α ( n ) = n / ( 1 + n ) , σ ( n ) = 1 / 2 , ε ( n ) = 1 / ( 1 + n ) , and ε ′ ( n ) = -1 / ( 1 + n ) 2 &lt; 0 . The CES function is μ ( n 1 , n 2 ) = ( n 1 a + n 1 a ) 1/a , where a ∈ ( -∞, 1 ) . This implies α ( n ) = ( 1 + n a ) 1/a , σ ( n ) = 1 / ( 1 -a ) , and ε ( n ) = n a / ( 1 + n a ) . Clearly, σ ≷ 1 ⇔ a ≷ 0 ⇔ ε ′ ( n ) = a n γ-1 / ( 1 + n a ) 2 ≷ 0 , providing a simple example with ε ′ &gt; 0 .
