        <p>This paper focuses on the relation between business innovation modes and environmental innovation. Over time firms have recognized the importance of prioritizing innovation to gain competitive advantages in open markets. Yet, in more recent times with the more recent international agreements on environmental sustainability (rounds in Doha in 2004; Copenhagen in 2009; Paris in 2016; and Glasgow in 2021), innovation needs to be guided through new boundaries and requirements that individual businesses and the business system as a whole face. One of these boundaries is nature and its resources which require significant protection as part of the international priority agenda on climate change agreed by most countries with the 2016 Paris Agreement on the Environment and recently confirmed with COP26. As firms are found to adopt alternative archetypical strategies of innovation, some science-driven (STI innovation mode) and others practice-driven (DUI innovation mode), we investigate whether any of these strategic modes is beneficial in relation to the capacity of the firms to produce eco-innovations, and which one is more beneficial in relation to which type of eco-innovation (e.g. technological and non-technological innovation). This analysis is seen in relation to the size of the firms as SMEs typically rely on practice and interactive-based innovation activities (DUI mode). This may help design environment protection-orientated policies that focus on specific drivers, thus making policy action efficient and effective. The analysis is based on the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) database for European countries. Our findings support the view that both STI and DUI drivers support eco-innovation through technological nuances that work also in the specific case of SME environmental innovation.This paper focuses on the relation between business innovation modes and environmental innovation.

        <p>Environmental protection and sustainability have become a priority across the world economy from the Bruntland Report (WCED, 1987) and Rio de Janeiro earth summit in 1992 and the following international agreements in Kyoto, Doha, Copenhagen up to the recent Paris Agreement in 2016 and COP26 in Glasgow. Environmental protection and the control of climate change have become crucial goals of the United Nations (United Nations, 2021). Simultaneously, innovation has become a clear priority for economic development as it represents the key driver for competitiveness in the current globalized markets (Hollanders et al., 2009;Edler and Fagerberg, 2017). However, innovation and environmental sustainability do not necessarily go hand in hand. The "weak sustainability" approach would entail the possibility to compensate for part of the depleted natural resources for some other form of capital (i.e. human capital or physical capital) within the overall "constant capital rule" (Wall, 2013). This dilemma motivates our work on the relation between firm-level innovation and environmental sustainability. In this study we utilize the "business innovation modes" framework that is derived from the literature on innovation systems (Jensen et al., 2007;Amara et al., 2008;Asheim and Parrilli, 2012) to analyze critical behaviours and strategies of innovation across firms that belong to specific production and innovation systems. We explore whether the two archetypical business innovation modes (science and technology based or STI, and innovation based on learning-by-doing, by-using and by-interacting or DUI) are critical for environmental innovation and to what extent (see Jensen et al., 2007;Parrilli et al., 2020). In addition, we analyze whether the behaviour of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) differs from the general trend and to what extent. This evidence can help identify policy actions that might have an impact on eco-innovation across SME.Environmental protection and sustainability have become a priority across the world economy from the Bruntland Report (WCED, 1987) and Rio de Janeiro earth summit in 1992 and the following international agreements in Kyoto, Doha, Copenhagen up to the recent Paris Agreement in 2016 and COP26 in Glasgow.

        <p>The contribution of this work is fourfold as we study 1) whether the practice-based innovation mode (DUI), that is typically adopted by most SMEs (Amara et al., 2008;Chen et al., 2011;Apanasovich et al., 2016;Thomä, 2017), is effective in generating eco-innovations; 2) whether the more expensive science and technology-based mode (STI) is the most effective in general and across SMEs. We also check 3) whether these modes have a differentiated impact depending on the type of eco-innovation (e.g. product vs process or non-technological innovation) as it is established in the broader literature on broader innovation (Amara et al., 2008;Parrilli;Alcalde, 2016;Trott and Simms, 2017). Moreover, 4) we assess a large set of European countries, thus deliver an assessment that goes beyond context/country specificities of the majority of studies on business innovation modes (Jensen et al., 2007;Fitjar and Rodriguez-Pose, 2013;Apanasovich et al., 2016;Lee and Miozzo, 2019) and on environmental innovation (De Marchi, 2012;Del Rio et al., 2017;Demirel and Kesidou, 2019; among others).The contribution of this work is fourfold as we study 1) whether the practice-based innovation mode (DUI), that is typically adopted by most SMEs (Amara et al., 2008;Chen et al., 2011;Apanasovich et al., 2016;Thomä, 2017), is effective in generating eco-innovations; 2) whether the more expensive science and technology-based mode (STI) is the most effective in general and across SMEs.

        <p>The literature on innovation systems has recently spawned a strand of scholarly contributions on the archetypical business innovation modes that are implemented in different countries and regions and that represent different entrepreneurial approaches to innovation and their success obtained at different latitudes (Jensen et al., 2007;Amara et al., 2008;Chen et al., 2011;Fitjar and Rodriguez-Pose, 2013;Apanasovich et al., 2016;Thomä and Zimmermann, 2020). Some businesses, regions and countries are particularly good in investing resources in R&amp;D and scientific human capital, and in collaboration with universities and research centers (the STI mode), while others are effective in reaping the benefits of more experiential and collaborative types of innovation modes (DUI). The former are usually the most advanced countries and regions, while the second refers to catching-up economies that invest fewer resources in R&amp;D (Parrilli et al., 2020;Hervas-Oliver et al., 2021). However, there may be context-specific reasons for such variations that lead to similar success levels. It is the case of Norway and Denmark that focus particularly on the DUI mode, while Sweden and Finland traditionally invest more resources in R&amp;D and scientific human capital (Edquist, 2004;Asheim and Parrilli, 2012).The literature on innovation systems has recently spawned a strand of scholarly contributions on the archetypical business innovation modes that are implemented in different countries and regions and that represent different entrepreneurial approaches to innovation and their success obtained at different latitudes (Jensen et al., 2007;Amara et al., 2008;Chen et al., 2011;Fitjar and Rodriguez-Pose, 2013;Apanasovich et al., 2016;Thomä and Zimmermann, 2020).

        <p>This literature on business innovation modes has produced a large number of contributions that focus on a range of aspects that include the special approach taken in traditional industries, e.g. food industry (Trott and Simms, 2017), and in knowledge-intensive business services (Lee and Miozzo, 2019), the different approach taken by high technology vs traditional industries in emerging economies (Chen et al., 2011, for China), the importance of global vs local STI and DUI collaborations (Fitjar and Rodriguez-Pose, 2013;Parrilli and Alcalde, 2016), a peculiar approach taken by small and medium-sized enterprises (Thomä, 2017;Thomӓ and Zimmermann, 2020;Parrilli and Radicic, 2021) or the innovation mode typically taken by firms in a range of regions classified among leading, strong, moderate and modest innovators (Parrilli et al., 2020) (see Table 1 for a review).This literature on business innovation modes has produced a large number of contributions that focus on a range of aspects that include the special approach taken in traditional industries, e.g. food industry (Trott and Simms, 2017), and in knowledge-intensive business services (Lee and Miozzo, 2019), the different approach taken by high technology vs traditional industries in emerging economies (Chen et al., 2011, for China), the importance of global vs local STI and DUI collaborations (Fitjar and Rodriguez-Pose, 2013;Parrilli and Alcalde, 2016), a peculiar approach taken by small and medium-sized enterprises (Thomä, 2017;Thomӓ and Zimmermann, 2020;Parrilli and Radicic, 2021) or the innovation mode typically taken by firms in a range of regions classified among leading, strong, moderate and modest innovators (Parrilli et al., 2020) (see Table 1 for a review).</p>
        <p>Every contribution in this area has opened reflections and queries that lead to more studies on key factors for innovation across businesses, regions and countries. Among the not yet investigated research areas in this strand of literature is the effort of businesses in the field of environmental innovation. This has become a priority for all countries and production systems that plan to compete today and in the future, and that want to respond to the Bruntland principle of: "Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs' (WCED, 1987: 8, 43). This effort would help scholars to understand whether the archetypical innovation modes are effective in relation to eco-innovations, and particularly within small and medium-sized enterprises.Every contribution in this area has opened reflections and queries that lead to more studies on key factors for innovation across businesses, regions and countries.

        <p>The work on eco-innovation is rather recent. Some contributions highlighted the existence of different types of drivers of eco-innovation at the macro, meso and micro level (Díaz-García et al., 2015). Other contributions stress the importance of connecting various sources of knowledge that help supporting this environmentally friendly business effort (Horbach et al., 2013;Ghisetti et al., 2015). This is seen as particularly important in relation to R&amp;D collaborative activities in which universities, suppliers and knowledge-intensive business services are crucial agents (De Marchi, 2012). This latter contribution also identifies a certain substitution effect between such external collaborations in R&amp;D and any internal effort made by the business itself in relation to environmental innovations (De Marchi, 2012). In general, most environmental innovation activities are found to be positively correlated with the financial performance of the firms (Marín-Vinuesa et al., 2020).The work on eco-innovation is rather recent.

        <p>Among the critical drivers, customer demand is included as more sensitive customers will raise their expectations of the environmental quality of the goods and services provided by producers. Scholarly contributions confirmed the importance of customers demand not only for the implementation of product eco-innovation in general, but also for the novelty/radicalness of such eco-innovations (Kammerer, 2009;Demirel and Kesidou, 2019;Costantini et al., 2020). Sometimes, firms implement environmental innovations as a means to apply minimal requirements of corporate social responsibility (CSR) that respond to their customers' sensitivity; however, the effective level of investment in environmentally friendly practices depend more on cost savings, firms' organizational capabilities, and stricter regulations which are indicated Source: own elaboration.Among the critical drivers, customer demand is included as more sensitive customers will raise their expectations of the environmental quality of the goods and services provided by producers.

Government regulation and policy are also identified as critical factors of environmental innovation across businesses by a number of scholars (Kammerer, 2009;Rennings and Rammer, 2011;Huang et al., 2016), although these may have a differentiated impact depending on the type of eco-innovation (e.g. positive for sustainable transport mobility and negative for water management, see Rennings and Rammer, 2011) (see Table 2 for a review).as key levers for the impact of customer demand on environmental innovation (Kesidou andDemirel, 2012, 2019;Huang et al., 2016).

        <p>The literature on STI and DUI innovation modes has established clear connections between the archetypical innovation modes and different types of innovation output -e.g. technological (product and process) and non-technological (marketing and organizational innovation, OECD, 2005) (see Amara et al., 2008;Chen et al., 2011;Apanasovich et al., 2016;Parrilli and Alcalde, 2016;Thomӓ and Zimmermann, 2020). However, this literature did not discuss yet the connection between these innovation modes and their impact on eco-innovations. In this case, we have a blue ocean of research that can be launched as a mean to identify whether firms and SMEs in particular pay attention to this objective, and whether any of these archetypical innovation modes (i.e. their effective strategies) is more successful in producing specific ecoinnovation outputs (e.g. product, process and non-technological innovation).The literature on STI and DUI innovation modes has established clear connections between the archetypical innovation modes and different types of innovation output -e.g. technological (product and process) and non-technological (marketing and organizational innovation, OECD, 2005) (see Amara et al., 2008;Chen et al., 2011;Apanasovich et al., 2016;Parrilli and Alcalde, 2016;Thomӓ and Zimmermann, 2020).

        <p>The question is whether businesses of all sizes and countries focus on eco-innovations that are defined as improvements in goods, processes, organization and marketing through a reduced production of pollution or by reducing the use of materials, energy, water, etc. or through the utilization of recycled water, materials and waste within the firms or across end-users (CIS, 2014: section 13). In particular, we focus on whether the application of STI and DUI modes generates impact not only on broad innovations, but also on specific environmental innovations (question 13.2 in 2014 questionnaire). In this way, our analysis echoes the work of Garcés-Ayerbe et al. (2016) in that we try to shed light not only on eco-innovations as a product (e.g. green patents), but on the whole set of potential eco-innovations that include also environmentally friendly new practices, organizational and commercial methods (see also Ghisetti and Rennings, 2014;Greco et al., 2020). Within the STI and DUI innovation framework, we expect the businesses that focus on innovation to use both modes in a significant way. STI drivers (R&amp;D and collaboration with universities) are likely to be involved as there is a growing international requirement to consider relevant environmental aspects/benefits in most R&amp;D-led innovation projects which are financed under public (e.g. Horizon-Europe/European Union, or the UN Sustainable Development Goals) or private schemes leading to the use of venture capital, bank loans and even stocks (Cainelli et al., 2012;De Marchi, 2012;Horbach et al., 2013;Ghisetti et al., 2015). However, from the previous studies in the literature on business innovation modes we know that STI drivers tend to have little impact on process innovation and non-technological innovation (i.e. organizational and marketing) as they are eminently focused on product innovation (Apanasovich et al., 2016;Trott and Simms, 2017;Parrilli et al., 2020). Thus, we hypothesize that these STI drivers are unlikely to generate a significant impact on environmentally friendly process, organizational and marketing innovations, such as the reduced use of resources, pollution levels and the likes (e.g. through the use of filters in polluting industries, or through a non-paper/poster-based marketing campaign led online). Simultaneously, the above literature on innovation modes stresses that STI drivers have the strongest impact on "product innovation" (Apanasovich et al., 2016;Parrilli;Alcalde, 2016;Parrilli et al., 2020), thus in this case we expect STI to produce strong impact on product eco-innovations, such as the production of e-vehicles, or the creation of longer duration (batteries for) electronic equipment such as laptops, mobile phones and tablets. As a result, the work of science and technology-based agents (e.g. universities, private science labs) and internal R&amp;D generate goods and services that can deliver effective environmental benefits. These eco-innovations have an impact on end-users as they will not need to buy these goods frequently, but may stick to their purchases for a longer time span (e.g. batteries), as these will be more energy efficient (e.g. new houses and cars).The question is whether businesses of all sizes and countries focus on eco-innovations that are defined as improvements in goods, processes, organization and marketing through a reduced production of pollution or by reducing the use of materials, energy, water, etc. or through the utilization of recycled water, materials and waste within the firms or across end-users (CIS, 2014: section 13).

        <p>In relation to the DUI innovation mode, we argue that this mode can also be very effective. In this case, firms that focus on innovation are likely to implement teamwork and purchase new machinery and equipmenttypical DUI practices within the firm-, as well as effective supply chain collaborations that impact on the efficient use of resources -DUI practice outside the firm - (Lam, 2004). This practice is likely to generate eco-innovations thanks to the collective responsibility towards the process and organizational method that lead to the production of final goods/services. For instance, ISO14001 and other certifications tend to guarantee the control of quality from the origin of materials and resources (see Inoue et al., 2013). Moreover, these practices promote a reduction in the use of natural resources, such as lumber in the furniture industry, or fuel in the energy industry by means of developing more efficient machinery and better organizational practices (e.g. plant layout). They may also lead to increases in productivity of existing technologies in renewable energies such as through the implementation of more efficient gearboxes and generators in the wind energy industry. Simultaneously, these firms are bounded by international regulations in relation to the quality of goods and services they provide to end-users (Demirel and Kesidou, 2019;Costantini et al., 2020).

        <p>Echoing previous work on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and innovation (Parrilli and Elola, 2012;Thomä, 2017;Parrilli and Radicic, 2021;Alhusen and Bennat, 2021), we want to discuss the peculiar approach that SMEs take on production and innovation practices that generate some type of eco-innovations. While Del Rio et al. ( 2017) identified a lower capacity of SMEs (vis-à-vis large firms) to produce eco-innovations, Marin et al. (2015) identified a significant SME heterogeneity in terms of their access and capacity to eco-innovate (see Table 3 for a review). Some become "green champions" while others face significant barriers to eco-innovation, and others are "non-eco-innovators". Such classification is related to both geographical and industry specializations although not as strictly as expected. Only the "green innovators" are typically found in industries that are non-emission intensive and are strongly regulated. Klewitz and Hansen (2014) follow a similar line of argument, but more in terms of environmental strategies and sustainability-oriented innovations (SOIs). Daddi et al. (2012) observed the heterogeneity of SME environmental focus across different industrial districts in Italy and found different eco-innovation approaches and outcomes, while the general eco-innovation effort is usually completed by successful economic performance. Triguero et al. (2013) argue that research collaborations with universities produce SME eco-innovations in goods and services, while supply-chain collaborations promote process and organizational eco-innovations. They also found that regulations and subsidies do not favour environmental innovations. Cecere et al. (2020) found that despite the growing demand for eco-innovation and regulatory interventions, the lack of access to funding and subsidies prevents SMEs from accelerating their contribution to eco-innovation. Networking and agglomeration economies are found not to matter much for SMEs, while instead being relevant for larger firms (Cainelli et al., 2012).Echoing previous work on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and innovation (Parrilli and Elola, 2012;Thomä, 2017;Parrilli and Radicic, 2021;Alhusen and Bennat, 2021), we want to discuss the peculiar approach that SMEs take on production and innovation practices that generate some type of eco-innovations.

        <p>In this study, we expect SMEs to focus less on STI drivers to produce eco-innovations. This is related to the size of their operations and the difficulties to engage in costly and lengthy projects with very selective outputs (i.e. eco-innovations) that will come far in the future (Bennat and Sternberg, 2020). In addition, the lack of highly specialized human capital within SMEs reduces their absorptive capacity, which is also associated to the firm investment and return on STI activities (Zahra and George, 2002). This may vary across industries (Daddi et al., 2012;Klewitz and Hansen, 2014;Marin et al., 2015), though this correlation is not expected to be strong. Instead, we argue that SMEs are more likely to engage in internal and external DUI practices (e.g. implement ISO 14, 000 certified environmental-friendly practices) to attain significant eco-innovations (Triguero et al., 2013). It is the way SMEs typically learn and innovate; thus they are likely to implement it also when producing eco-innovations (e.g. ways to reducing the use of materials and the generation of waste). For this reason, we set two general propositions that can be ascertained through the successive descriptive statistics: P1: SMEs tend to adopt more significantly the DUI innovation mode than the STI innovation mode.In this study, we expect SMEs to focus less on STI drivers to produce eco-innovations.

        <p>However, more specifically and according to previous studies on innovation modes (Parrilli and Radicic, 2021) and on environmental innovation (Triguero et al., 2013), we expect SMEs to be able to reap benefits from STI drivers in relation to product-based eco-innovation but not so much in relation to process and non-technological innovation. Instead, we expect to find the DUI drivers to generate impact on eco-innovation through process, organizational and marketing innovation.

        <p>The empirical analysis is drawn upon firm-level data form the Community Innovation Survey (CIS), which have been used extensively in the innovation literature (Cassiman and Veugelers, 2002;Ballot et al., 2015) and eco-innovation studies (Madaleno et al., 2020;Biscione et al., 2021). CIS is based on harmonized questionnaire based on the Oslo Manual (OECD, 2005) with methodological recommendations specified by the Eurostat (CIS Quality Report, 2014). CIS has its advantages and disadvantages; yet it is characterized by high response rate, standardized methodology and data of high quality that enables comparisons across countries. We use the CIS 2014 dataset that covers the period 2012-2014 and includes 10 EU countries from South and Eastern Europe (Greece, Portugal, Croatia, Romania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Slovakia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania). These are the only EU countries that delivered good responses on the environmental part of the survey. Overall, the CIS2014 gives us an opportunity to investigate environmental innovation as, after CIS2008, it is the only CIS survey that incorporates questions on firms' environmental strategies and their connections to different types of innovations. CIS2014 have already been used in the innovation literature (Parrilli et al., 2020), but investigation of eco-innovation appears only recently, and it is still limited (Madaleno et al., 2020;Biscione et al., 2021). 1 A number of effective observations (used in empirical models) for each country are shown in Table 4.The empirical analysis is drawn upon firm-level data form the Community Innovation Survey (CIS), which have been used extensively in the innovation literature (Cassiman and Veugelers, 2002;Ballot et al., 2015) and eco-innovation studies (Madaleno et al., 2020;Biscione et al., 2021).

        <p>Regarding explanatory variables of interest, we follow the classification of STI and DUI innovation modes developed by Jensen et al. (2007). The advantage is that, unlike studies that measure STI and DUI based on different types of collaboration (Chen et al., 2011;Fitjar and Rodriguez-Pose, 2013;Parrilli and Alcalde, 2016;Haus-Reve et al., 2019), our investigation also considers firms' internal activities associated with STI or DUI innovation modes (Parrilli et al., 2020;Parrilli and Radicic, 2021). The STI variable is equal to 1 if firms either undertake (internal and/or external) R&amp;D activities or cooperate with higher education institutions and government research centers, and zero otherwise. Collaboration is deemed to be an important explanatory variable for environmental innovation in the literature (Wagner, 2008;Mazzanti and Zoboli, 2009).

This variable takes value of 1 if any of these activities or types of cooperation occurs, and zero otherwise.Regarding explanatory variables of interest, we follow the classification of STI and DUI innovation modes developed by Jensen et al.

        <p>Regarding control (matching) variables, one set of variables controls for determinants specific to environmental innovation. These are all binary variables that controls for incentives for introduction of environmental variables. CIS2014 incorporates questions on different incentives for the introduction of environmental innovation, ranging from the those imposed by government regulations and incentives (regulation and taxes-present and anticipated, grants or public procurement) to those incentivized by the market and corporate image (reputation and expected market demand). These determinants have been extensively studied in the literature (see the review in Horbach et al., 2012). Regulation, both present and anticipated, have been identified in the empirical literature as one of the most important drivers of the environmental innovation (Del Río, 2009;De Marchi, 2012;Chassagnon and Haned, 2015;Greco et al., 2020). Likewise, demand and corporate image is found to be important factor for introduction of environmental innovation (Kammerer, 2009;Chassagnon and Haned, 2015). These incentives are included in our models as the dummy variables which measure important factors in firms' decision to engage in environmental innovation (at either high or medium levels): Regulation, Taxes, Grants, Demand, and Reputation.

        <p>We control for firm characteristics, such as firm size (in the full sample, exporting and belonging to an enterprise group. Firm size is one of the traditional control variables in the empirical investigation of different aspects of innovation outputs in general (Cassiman and Veugelers, 2002;Parrilli et al., 2020) and environmental innovation in particular (Veugelers, 2012;Borghesi et al., 2015;Greco et al., 2020). In our study, firm size is measured by using a dummy variable for SMEs (Greco et al., 2020;Parrilli et al., 2020). In addition, we control for the exporting status of a firm, given that the literature shows that being an exporter results in a higher level of innovation output (Ghisetti et al., 2015;Greco et al., 2020), as exporting firms might face tougher competition in international markets. Empirical models also control for firms belonging to an enterprise group (Ghisetti, 2017;Marzucchi and Montresor, 2017).

        <p>A recent literature on STI and DUI innovation modes raised an issue of their endogeneity, arising from the nature of their components, i.e. endogeneity of internal and external R&amp;D activities (Duso et al., 2014), and a potential reverse causality between cooperation for innovation and innovation performance (Vivas and Barge-Gil, 2015;Pippel and Seefeld, 2016;Haus-Reve et al., 2019;Parrilli and Radicic, 2021).

        <p>In a cross-sectional setting like ours, treatment effects can be estimated either using the instrumental variable (IV) approach or matching estimators. The former requires valid instrument(s) for the treatment variable(s), which is often difficult to find, in particular in the stream of research on a firm-level innovation (Love et al., 2014;Parrilli and Radicic, 2021). Matching estimators have few advantages over other cross-section empirical strategies. Compared to the IV approach, matching does not require valid instruments and it does not make any assumptions about the functional form of the outcome equation (Czarnitzki et al., 2007). However, the main disadvantage of matching estimators is the assumption of unconfoundedness or selection on observables. This means that matching estimators assume that unobserved heterogeneity is unlikely to arise.

        <p>Given that firms might simultaneously engage in STI and DUI modes, we estimate treatment effects in the multiple treatment contexts through the matching approach with multiple treatments introduced by Lechner (2001). We have M+1 treatments, whereby treatment = 0 denotes firms that do not engage in either STI or DUI; treatment = 1 denotes engagement only in STI mode only; treatment = 2 refers to engagement only in DUI mode; and treatment = 3 refers to engagement in both innovation modes. The average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) effect is then calculated as:Given that firms might simultaneously engage in STI and DUI modes, we estimate treatment effects in the multiple treatment contexts through the matching approach with multiple treatments introduced by Lechner (2001).

        <p>The IPWRA estimator belongs to a group of matching estimators that have the double-robust property. Double robustness implies that either the treatment model or the outcome model (or both) has to be correctly specified for the estimator to produce consistent treatment effects (Hirano et al., 2003). The use of the IPWRA estimator requires three steps. First, for each firm in the sample, the treatment model estimates the propensity score, which is the probability of a treatment assignment.The IPWRA estimator belongs to a group of matching estimators that have the double-robust property.

        <p>Given that we evaluate multiple treatment effects, the propensity scores are estimated by a multinomial logit model, incorporating all four treatment levels: neither STI nor DUI; only DUI; only STI; and both. 3 The choice of the model is motivated by the nature of our treatment variable, which has more than two outcomes with no natural ordering. The propensity scores enable firms to be matched within each treatment level. Second, regressions are estimated by the logit model, because the outcome variables are binary indicators, in which the inverse of the estimated propensity scores are used as weights on covariates X and our treatment dummies. Third, from each of these regressions, the ATT effect is computed as the difference in the weighted averages of the predicted outcomes (for technical details, see Wooldridge, 2010). This three-step approach provides consistent estimates given the underlying assumption of the independence of the treatment from the predicted outcomes once covariates are modelled in steps 1 and 2. We report valid standard errors (of the Huber/White/sandwich type) which take into account that the estimates are computed in a three-step approach (Emsley et al., 2008).Given that we evaluate multiple treatment effects, the propensity scores are estimated by a multinomial logit model, incorporating all four treatment levels: neither STI nor DUI; only DUI; only STI; and both. 3 The choice of the model is motivated by the nature of our treatment variable, which has more than two outcomes with no natural ordering.

        <p>Table 5 shows descriptive statistics and variable description. On average, the full sample as well as the specific SMEs sample focus more on process eco-innovation with around 50% of the firms engaging in this kind of innovation. Product eco-innovation follows with around 40% of firms. Instead, organizational and marketing eco-innovation attain lower results (25% and 11% respectively). Importantly, these descriptive statistics indicate the emphasis that all firms, including the SMEs, put on technological eco-innovation (i.e. product and process) vis-à-vis non-technological eco-innovation. In relation to the specific case of SMEs, proposition P2 is partially confirmed as process innovations are certainly the most targeted innovation, but product innovation is also developed to a significant extent and certainly more than nontechnological innovation. This is explained with the traditional emphasis attributed to technological innovations over nontechnological innovations across all classes of firms (Jensen et al., 2007;Fitjar and Rodriguez-Pose, 2013, among others).Table 5 shows descriptive statistics and variable description. On average, the full sample as well as the specific SMEs sample focus more on process eco-innovation with around 50% of the firms engaging in this kind of innovation. Product eco-innovation follows with around 40% of firms. Instead, organizational and marketing eco-innovation attain lower results (25% and 11% respectively). Importantly, these descriptive statistics indicate the emphasis that all firms, including the SMEs, put on technological eco-innovation (i.e. product and process) vis-à-vis non-technological eco-innovation.

        <p>The other important descriptive statistics refers to the innovation modes adoption by all firms and by SMEs (see Table 6). We see a balanced approach with a significant number of firms that do not adopt any innovation mode, thus are not yet focusing their activities and objectives on the production of eco-innovations (20% for the whole set of firms, and 22% across SMEs). However, a larger group of firms and SMEs 2 To avoid the dummy variable trap, one of the country dummies needs to be omitted. The choice of the omitted dummy, called the reference or the base category, is arbitrary (Stock and Watson, 2019, p. 230). Thus, Slovakia has been randomly chosen as the reference category.The other important descriptive statistics refers to the innovation modes adoption by all firms and by SMEs (see Table 6).

The coefficients in multinomial logit models are not of interest in themselves, as the purpose of specifying the model is to facilitate the estimation of treatment effects by estimating a propensity score needed for the matching procedure (Cattaneo et al., 2013).3 Due to a large number of models that are estimated, results from multinomial logit models are not reported but are available upon request.

        <p>adopt either the STI mode, or the DUI mode or even the combined STI&amp;DUI mode (78%-80%). As we expected, a large cohort of firms and SMEs adopt the DUI mode, more traditional, experience-and interaction-based (31-32%) and a smaller cohort adopts the STI mode (9%). This preliminary outcome confirms our proposition P1. However, rather surprisingly a significant proportion of firms and SMEs already adopt the challenging combined STI&amp;DUI mode (40% across the whole sample, and 36% across SMEs). This indicates that a large group of firms, including SMEs, are becoming sensitive to the importance of a wider and more complete approach to business innovation, which in relation to general innovation is proved to be the mode with the highest overall attainments (Jensen et al., 2007;Isaksen;Karlsen, 2010;Parrilli;Alcalde, 2016;Parrilli et al., 2020). Pearson's correlation coefficients amongst the control (matching) variables are presented in Table 7 (for the full sample) and Table 8 (for SMEs). The correlations in both samples are overall low to moderate, suggesting that multicollinearity is unlikely to occur.adopt either the STI mode, or the DUI mode or even the combined STI&amp;DUI mode (78%-80%).

        <p>Table 9 presents empirical results for the full sample, while Table 10 shows results for SMEs. Overall, the impact of STI drivers is significant on product eco-innovation, while it is not significant when it is applied to process, marketing and organizational eco-innovations. As a result, H1a and H1b are both supported. This general outcome is valid also in the case of SMEs, thus also H3a is fully supported. As a consequence, we can affirm that this technological nuance of innovation (Apanasovich et al., 2016;Parrilli;Alcalde, 2016;Trott and Simms, 2017) work also in the case of eco-innovation.Table 9 presents empirical results for the full sample, while Table 10 shows results for SMEs.

        <p>Interestingly, our empirical analysis shows that the combined STI&amp;DUI mode works in all cases, technological and non-technological eco-innovations. This seems to indicate that a work that combines the competences and commitment of all staff within the firms as well as along the supply chain with the skills and capabilities of dedicated R&amp;D personnel and infrastructures are likely to build on one another, helps attaining a higher capacity to generate all types of eco-innovations. In a way, these findings strengthen the arguments made by Jensen et al. (2007), Parrilli andAlcalde-Heras (2016), andParrilli et al. (2020) about broader innovations as also in the case of eco-innovation, the combined STI and DUI mode builds additional strengths and outputs, favoring a stronger environmental innovation path.Interestingly, our empirical analysis shows that the combined STI&amp;DUI mode works in all cases, technological and non-technological eco-innovations.

        <p>Looking at the impact of the DUI mode, its effects on eco-innovation also varies depending on the type of innovation. This mode is highly significant in the full sample as well as for SMEs (p &lt; 0.01), though they are significantly related to eco-innovation when they produce process, marketing and organizational eco-innovations, while they become insignificant when they develop product eco-innovations. As a result, hypotheses H2a, H2b and H3b are confirmed, thus align with previous studies on supply chain-led environmental innovations (Kammerer, 2009;Kesidou andDemirel, 2012, 2019;Huang et al., 2016) and on broader technological innovation (Parrilli and Radicic, 2021). Moreover, in this case, a combined STI&amp;DUI mode is generating a positive sum game, thus generates higher eco-innovations than through the applications of the individual modes separately. This outcome also shows the importance of combining skills and capabilities across the whole personnel, including those focusing on a dedicated R&amp;D activity (Parrilli et al., 2020). 4Looking at the impact of the DUI mode, its effects on eco-innovation also varies depending on the type of innovation.

        <p>Overall, our analysis produces relevant findings in relation to the impact of specific STI and DUI drivers on the eco-innovation practices and performance of all firms and the SMEs in particular. In this study we have identified important eco-innovation patterns across the whole sample of firms and the SMEs. Small variations are visible across different firm sizes. One of the main findings is about the predominance of technological eco-innovation across firms, and particularly process eco-innovation that is practiced by around 50% of the SMEs. Simultaneously, product eco-innovation is practiced by around 40% of the SMEs. In relation to the modes of innovation there is still a significant percentage of firms that do not adopt any innovation mode (20% across the whole sample and 22% across SMEs). A tiny percentage adopts the STI innovation mode (9%) while the expected majority adopts the DUI mode (32% across SMEs). A very interesting outcome however is that a significant proportion of firms and SMEs are already implementing the STI&amp;DUI mode together (36% of SMEs). In the econometric analysis this combined mode is the most effective across all types of innovation output. These findings show the yet extreme heterogeneity of firm/SME behavior in relation to the new environmental objectives set by the Paris 2016 and COP26 Agreements on Climate Change 2016, and the United Nations Development Goals (Daddi et al., 2012;Marin et al., 2015;Del Rio et al., 2017).Overall, our analysis produces relevant findings in relation to the impact of specific STI and DUI drivers on the eco-innovation practices and performance of all firms and the SMEs in particular.

        <p>Our second main finding is about the technological nuances of both innovation modes for eco-innovation. STI drivers matter especially for product eco-innovations, while not at all for process, organizational and commercial innovation. This clarifies the focus of R&amp;D activities and university-industry collaborations towards product eco-innovations that help the firm to save on materials, recycle materials, and pollute less (De Marchi, 2012;Triguero et al., 2013;Ghisetti et al., 2015). This illustrates that STI drivers and activities tend to be designed and developed in-house by scientists that are likely to pay limited attention to the demands of buyers and consumers. This indicates significant margins for improvement and impact at the societal level to meet the objectives designed by those global agreements in pro of environmental sustainability. Instead, DUI drivers matter for process, organizational and commercial eco-innovation but not so much for product eco-innovation. This applies particularly to the case of SMEs and it is expected as SMEs innovate by means of practice and supply chain interactions that help them improve their production process in ecological terms (Triguero et al., 2013;Demirel and Kesidou, 2019;Costantini et al., 2020). Overall, the nuances of innovation (Parrilli and Alcalde, 2016;Parrilli et al., 2020) work also in relation to eco-innovation. Notwithstanding these technological nuances, the combined STI&amp;DUI mode is the most effective mode in all types of eco-innovation as shown also in relation to broader innovation (Jensen et al., 2007;Isaksen;Karlsen, 2010;Chen et al., 2011;Apanasovich et al., 2016). These results also apply to different firm classes as no large variations are found between the whole sample and SMEs. And yet we know that they are implemented by a segment of firms (36% across SMEs and 40% across the whole sample). This shows the important margins for improvement in the approach to eco-innovation across a large majority of firms and particularly across 4 For robustness check, we re-estimated the models using the Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW). The difference between this estimator and our preferred estimator (that is, IPWRA) is that the latter has a double robustness property (see Section 3.5) which is not the case with the IPW. The treatment effects from the IPW are shown in Table A1 for the full sample and in Table A2 for SMEs. Qualitatively, the results using the IPW are the very similar as our main results reported in Tables 9 and10. a We report two types of diagnostics regarding matching quality of our estimator. First, Figure A1 in Appendix shows that, in matched data, standardised differences between coefficients are close to zero and weighted variance ratios are close to one, which indicates an optimal matching quality (see also Stojcic, 2021). Second, the overlap plots, reported in Figures A2 andA3 for the full sample and SMEs respectively, reveal that the predicted probabilities are not concentrated near 0 or 1, which implies that the overlap assumption discussed in Section 3.5 is not violated (Cattaneo et al., 2013). We do not show industry and country dummies as the figures would be rather large, but are available upon request.Our second main finding is about the technological nuances of both innovation modes for eco-innovation.

        <p>Estimation results from the IPWRA estimator -SMEs (N = 5580). approach could be strengthened also by signaling the positive market response to firms that systematically invest in innovation activities to boost their competitiveness. This implies that policy initiatives at both national and local level can focus on the development of internal activities (e.g. towards the promotion of on-the-job training, teamwork and design) and external activities (e.g. ISO and other relevant certifications, CSR accreditations, as well as marketing and commercial training) that are likely to activate channels that sensitize SMEs towards the request of their end users. Simultaneously, it is important to recognize the yet limited commitment of SMEs towards eco-innovation in general as only 50% of these firms produce effective process eco-innovations while much lower percentages produce product (37%), organizational (24%) and commercial (11%) eco-innovations. Incentives and sensitization from both public policy bodies and business associations could be put in place to increase the proportion of SMEs that pay attention to this priority for the competitiveness and wellbeing of society.Estimation results from the IPWRA estimator -SMEs (N = 5580). approach could be strengthened also by signaling the positive market response to firms that systematically invest in innovation activities to boost their competitiveness.

        <p>In conclusion, this is a first analysis on the importance of the archetypical business innovation modes on eco-innovations. Given that the countries in our sample are lagging behind the EU average in terms of innovation performance, findings from this study can be primarily generalized to other European countries at a similar level of innovation performance (e.g. Balkan countries outside of the EU) as well as to countries outside Europe that want to significantly improve their relatively lower innovation performance. Considering the scarcity of empirical findings regarding laggard/catching-up countries, this study might serve as a benchmark.In conclusion, this is a first analysis on the importance of the archetypical business innovation modes on eco-innovations.

        <p>Moreover, further studies may help deepen this analysis at the micro level; for instance by studying the impact of individual drivers within each of innovation modes (Runst and Thoma, 2021), and at the macro/meso level, for instance through the analysis of the rate of implementation of eco-innovations across different types of countries and regions; e.g. innovation leaders, strong innovators, moderate and modest innovators (Díaz-García et al., 2015;Parrilli et al., 2020), or across industries that are expected to produce a radically different outcome in relation to eco-innovations (e.g. former highly polluting industries such as leather or pulp and paper vs knowledge-intensive business services amongst others). Moving from cross-section type of analysis to panel data would also help to gather the evolution of business innovation modes implemented by SMEs and other firms over time.Moreover, further studies may help deepen this analysis at the micro level; for instance by studying the impact of individual drivers within each of innovation modes (Runst and Thoma, 2021), and at the macro/meso level, for instance through the analysis of the rate of implementation of eco-innovations across different types of countries and regions; e.g. innovation leaders, strong innovators, moderate and modest innovators (Díaz-García et al., 2015;Parrilli et al., 2020), or across industries that are expected to produce a radically different outcome in relation to eco-innovations (e.g. former highly polluting industries such as leather or pulp and paper vs knowledge-intensive business services amongst others).

        <p>These outcomes are useful for policymakers as they are informed about the dual possibility to promote eco-innovations, not just through expensive and large firm-led R&amp;D activities and long-term collaborations with universities that demand human resource time, but also through supply chain interactions orientated for instance to apply certified practices (e.g. ISO14,000), strategic collaborations with buyers, and effective internal practices (e.g. teamwork, in-house training). This finding is particularly important for SMEs that for 22% of the cases do not implement any innovation mode/strategy and in 31% of the cases rely only on practice and interaction-based activities. This implies that many firms and SMEs do still leave innovation as a casual outcome of their production activities rather than as the fruit of a systematic approach. Policy makers could take this information as a basis to stir a more proactive and complete approach (the combined STI&amp;DUI)) across firms, in particular by signaling with more evidence the existence of innovation programs focused on SMEs (e.g. Horizon-Europe).
