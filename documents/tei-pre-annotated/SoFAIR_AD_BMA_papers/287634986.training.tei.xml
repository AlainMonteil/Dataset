        <p>The impacts of tourism boycotts on a destination's tourist economy can be vast, yet few studies have examined such events. This paper explores the effects of tourism boycotts by analysing seven events involving Chinese tourism boycotts during the past decade. The findings show that boycotts can significantly decrease visitor numbers. Also, non-political animosity boycotts and political animosity boycotts differ in their intensity and impact; the former are found to exert immediate short-term impacts, whereas the latter tend to have enduring effects. These results are based on local projection techniques using narratively identified boycott events and are robust to several specifications. This paper highlights tourism boycotts as a key risk factor in destination management.The impacts of tourism boycotts on a destination's tourist economy can be vast, yet few studies have examined such events.

This paper highlights tourism boycotts as a key risk factor in destination management.</p>
        <p>With increasing global mobility and a shifting global political landscape, international tourism has experienced turbulence recently. Research has shown that tourism is vulnerable to incidents such as terrorist attacks and crime (Bianchi, 2006), financial crises (Lim &amp; McAleer, 2005), natural disasters (Huang &amp; Min, 2002), disease outbreaks (Yang &amp; Chen, 2009), and flight accidents (Hall &amp; Page, 2016). Missing amongst these factors is tourism boycotts, where tourists withhold travel to a destination (Shaheer, Insch &amp; Carr, 2018).With increasing global mobility and a shifting global political landscape, international tourism has experienced turbulence recently.

Missing amongst these factors is tourism boycotts, where tourists withhold travel to a destination (Shaheer, Insch &amp; Carr, 2018).</p>
        <p>Compared with the aforementioned factors, tourism boycotts can have equally if not more damaging effects on a destination's tourism economy but have received surprisingly little attention in the literature (Shaheer et al., 2018).Compared with the aforementioned factors, tourism boycotts can have equally if not more damaging effects on a destination's tourism economy but have received surprisingly little attention in the literature (Shaheer et al., 2018).</p>
        <p>The number of tourism boycotts has risen throughout the past decade; 146 boycotts occurred from 1948 to 2015, more than 90% of which took place between 2003 and 2015 (Shaheer et al., 2018, p. 129). Factors contributing to this increase include technological innovations, which facilitate boycott organisation via social media; an increase in social movements related to justice and morality; growing awareness of ethical consumerism; and use of tourism as a vehicle for social change (Shaheer et al., 2018) or political negotiation (Castañeda &amp; Burtner, 2010). Given the negative effects of tourism boycotts on various stakeholders, including state and local governments, tourism establishments, tourism enterprises, employees, and residents (Sautter &amp; Leisen, 1999), these boycotts represent an urgent matter warranting further investigation as a risk factor in destination management.The number of tourism boycotts has risen throughout the past decade; 146 boycotts occurred from 1948 to 2015, more than 90% of which took place between 2003 and 2015 (Shaheer et al., 2018, p. 129).

        <p>Consumer behaviour studies have confirmed that animosity greatly increases consumers' intentions to boycott and often leads to boycott actions via product purchasing behaviour (Klein, Ettenson &amp; Morris, 1998). In tourism, using a sample of young Chinese consumers, Guo, Zhou and Hu's (2016) findings showed that animosity adversely affected young Chinese tourists' willingness to visit Japan; however, the authors only measured consumers' visit intentions rather than their real tourist behaviour and were thus unable to capture actual damage from boycott behaviour. Campo and Alvarez (2017) also discussed animosity relative to a decrease in tourists' visit intentions, but their study suffered from the same issue as that of Guo et al. (2016): Campo and Alvarez (2017) measured visit intention rather than boycott behaviour. Despite the intuitive connection between visit intention and actual visitation, the former has been found to be an unreliable predictor of the latter (McKercher &amp; Tse, 2012).Consumer behaviour studies have confirmed that animosity greatly increases consumers' intentions to boycott and often leads to boycott actions via product purchasing behaviour (Klein, Ettenson &amp; Morris, 1998).

        <p>Given the lack of knowledge about tourism boycotts and the extent to which they may compromise the tourism economy, this study focuses on the following research objectives: 1) investigating the effects of tourism boycotts on visitor numbers; and 2) exploring how boycott effects differ based on the type of animosity (i.e., political versus non-political animosity).Given the lack of knowledge about tourism boycotts and the extent to which they may compromise the tourism economy, this study focuses on the following research objectives: 1) investigating the effects of tourism boycotts on visitor numbers; and 2) exploring how boycott effects differ based on the type of animosity (i.e., political versus non-political animosity).</p>

        <p>Boycotts can be traced back to the 7 th century (Peters, 2009). In modern times, boycotts have exemplified the empowerment of powerless groups to change their circumstances, such as the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and Gandhi's boycotts of British salt and cloth before Indian independence. Garrett (1987) defined boycotts as "concerted, but nonmandatory, refusal by a group of actors (the agents) to conduct marketing transactions with one or more other actors (the target) for the purpose of communicating displeasure with certain target policies and attempting to coerce the target to modify those policies" (p. 47).Boycotts can be traced back to the 7 th century (Peters, 2009).

        <p>With wide adoption of the internet and social media, consumer boycotts can be organised and promoted more easily. One in five consumers have reportedly boycotted a brand following a scandal or negative press release (YouGov, 2017). Although it is difficult to determine a boycott's success (Friedman, 1985), the growing importance of boycotts for consumers, marketers, and public policymakers has spurred investigations into these acts' historical evolution, antecedents, consequences, key dimensions, and influences (Sen, Gürhan-Canli &amp; Morwitz, 2001). Nevertheless, relevant studies in tourism contexts remain scarce.With wide adoption of the internet and social media, consumer boycotts can be organised and promoted more easily.

        <p>The boycott phenomenon has been examined in diverse disciplines, including sociology and history (Friedman, 1985); psychology and economics (Heilmann, 2016;John &amp; Klein, 2003); political science (Richter, 1983); and marketing (Garrett, 1987). The boycott literature generally focuses on four aspects: a) motivations underlying boycotts (e.g. Klein, Smith &amp; John, 2002); b) purposes of boycotts (e.g. Friedman, 1985;Klein et al., 2002); c) boycott actions (e.g. Friedman, 1985Friedman, , 1991)); and d) the effects of boycotts, such as changes in public policies (e.g. Braunsberger &amp; Buckler, 2009), corporate practices (e.g. Lavorata, 2014), and financial impacts (e.g. Heilmann, 2016) (see Figure 1).The boycott phenomenon has been examined in diverse disciplines, including sociology and history (Friedman, 1985); psychology and economics (Heilmann, 2016;John &amp; Klein, 2003); political science (Richter, 1983); and marketing (Garrett, 1987).

        <p>Motivations behind organising a boycott may be tied to individual beliefs or value systems, an organisation's mission, or a governmental body's political purpose (Braunsberger &amp; Buckler, 2009). Consumer boycotts embody individuals' attempts to achieve certain objectives via restraining their purchases (Friedman, 1985). Individuals' motivations for boycotting may include expressing altruistic sentiments, anger and animosity, or moral superiority (Klein et al., 1998). In particular, as "remnants of antipathy related to previous or on-going military, political, or economic events" (Klein et al., 1998, p. 90), animosity is a crucial element in consumer boycotts and can affect consumers' boycott intentions and behaviours (Huang, Phau &amp; Lin, 2010). People may also seek a sense of belonging from undertaking collective actions with others who share similar values, beliefs, or causes (John &amp; Klein, 2003). At the organisational level, non-profit organisations may coordinate boycotts to realise organisational objectives, attract and maintain public attention, or transform nonmarketplace concerns into marketplace goals (Heilmann, 2016). At the government level, nation-states may use boycotts as political weapons to impose pressure on less powerful counterparts in hopes of resolving political conflict (Castañeda &amp; Burtner, 2010).Motivations behind organising a boycott may be tied to individual beliefs or value systems, an organisation's mission, or a governmental body's political purpose (Braunsberger &amp; Buckler, 2009).

        <p>Derived from boycott motivation, boycott behaviour is often carried out to achieve specific cognitive purposes. These include the aims to impose economic loss, force behaviour change, damage the image of the boycott target, and express a moral cause. Friedman (1985) categorised boycotts into two groups, instrumental or expressive, based on their purposes.Derived from boycott motivation, boycott behaviour is often carried out to achieve specific cognitive purposes.

        <p>Instrumental boycotts are undertaken to pursue clear and measurable outcomes on policy changes in relation to human or animal rights (Klein et al., 2002) and to gain bargaining power in trade or international relations (Heilmann, 2016). Comparatively, expressive boycotts enable individuals to voice their displeasure towards a target entity (Ettenson &amp; Klein, 2005). Friedman (1991) suggested that instrumental boycotts can be further classified as either media-oriented or market-oriented and surrogate or non-surrogate. Media-oriented boycotts seek to paint a negative image of a target, whereas market-oriented boycotts aim to damage the target's sales and reputation. Market-and media-oriented boycotts may both use a surrogate as an agent between the boycotter and the target (Friedman, 1985).Instrumental boycotts are undertaken to pursue clear and measurable outcomes on policy changes in relation to human or animal rights (Klein et al., 2002) and to gain bargaining power in trade or international relations (Heilmann, 2016).

        <p>Boycott actions are difficult to define, as the interpretation of boycotts may involve different stages from the consideration of boycott action to actual action taken (Friedman, 1991). Criteria for boycott execution and success are similarly nebulous (Friedman, 1991).Boycott actions are difficult to define, as the interpretation of boycotts may involve different stages from the consideration of boycott action to actual action taken (Friedman, 1991).

        <p>For example, action-requested boycotts (e.g. protests) differ from action-taken boycotts (e.g. refusal to purchase). The success of a boycott may refer to an actual decline in sales, a tarnished target image, or target-based policy change. Given the challenge in determining when a boycott is complete, evaluating a boycott's success is problematic (Friedman, 1991).For example, action-requested boycotts (e.g. protests) differ from action-taken boycotts (e.g. refusal to purchase).

        <p>The involved entities may also differ. In beneficiary boycotts, boycott sponsors and boycotters are members of the same constituency; in conscience boycotts, sponsors and boycotters represent different constituencies (McCarthy &amp; Zald, 1973;Friedman, 1991).The involved entities may also differ. In beneficiary boycotts, boycott sponsors and boycotters are members of the same constituency; in conscience boycotts, sponsors and boycotters represent different constituencies (McCarthy &amp; Zald, 1973;Friedman, 1991).</p>
        <p>The impacts of boycott actions are also difficult to measure. At the individual level, boycotts empower individuals who may feel powerless by enabling them to negotiate with organisations through collective actions (Lee, 2012). When individuals participate in a successful boycott, they may enjoy the free ride, the excitement of victory, or the satisfaction of punishing wrongdoers via boycott behaviour (John &amp; Klein, 2003). Successful boycotts may also lead to long-term changes in individuals' buying habits, which often inspire enduring structural change. Conversely, individuals who may have been forced to comply with a boycott due to social pressure may experience negative impacts (Cheng &amp; Wong, 2014). Boycotts can result in economic pressure on the targeted entity, driving the entity to formulate a policy commitment and modify practices in response to coercion (Koku, 2012).The impacts of boycott actions are also difficult to measure.

        <p>For targeted companies, boycotts can have detrimental effects on corporate performance, particularly in terms of sales, brand image, reputation, and stakeholder relationships (Koku, Akhigbe &amp; Springer, 1997;Schrempf-Stirling, Bosse &amp; Harrison, 2013). When boycotts target a nation-state, impacts vary depending on the negotiating power between the target and the boycotter, the importance of boycotted products in the targeted nation-state, and other environmental factors. A boycotted nation-state may be affected by economic loss (Heilmann, 2016), job loss in relevant industries (Braunserger &amp; Buckler, 2009), and governmental changes in political stance or policy (Richter, 1983). Although a boycott may empower some consumers, organisations, and nation-states, the impacts of boycotts have not received much research attention, particularly in the tourism sector, despite the far-reaching effects of such events.For targeted companies, boycotts can have detrimental effects on corporate performance, particularly in terms of sales, brand image, reputation, and stakeholder relationships (Koku, Akhigbe &amp; Springer, 1997;Schrempf-Stirling, Bosse &amp; Harrison, 2013).

        <p>Different from consumer product/corporate boycotts, a tourism boycott refers to any form of "withholding of tourism" against a particular tourist destination (Castañeda &amp; Burtner, 2010, p. 2) rather than against a brand or a business entity. Similar to consumer product/corporate boycotts, tourism boycotts are collectively initiated by individuals for certain causes or surrogated by agents (e.g. NGOs or governments) as tools in negotiating international politics (Castañeda &amp; Burtner, 2010). Nevertheless, tourism boycotts are likely to be engaged at a larger scale and have a more profound socio-economic impact (Shaheer et al., 2018) than consumer boycotts; by withholding tourism against a destination, tourism boycotts directly and indirectly affect different stakeholders, communities, and business entities.Different from consumer product/corporate boycotts, a tourism boycott refers to any form of "withholding of tourism" against a particular tourist destination (Castañeda &amp; Burtner, 2010, p. 2) rather than against a brand or a business entity.

        <p>With the growing popularity of social media adoption worldwide and a corresponding increase in social movements and emphasis on ethical consumerism, tourism boycotts are becoming more frequent and reoccurring (Shaheer et al., 2018). Existing works have shown that the most common purposes of tourism boycotts focus on resolving human rights violations, animal welfare concerns, and political and environmental issues (Shaheer, Carr &amp; Insch, 2019). For example, the International Union of Food and Allied Workers' tourism boycott against Guatemala came in protest against the country's governmental human rights violations in 1979 (Castañeda &amp; Burtner, 2010), wherein the tourism boycott was used by institutions "as [a] governmental [mechanism] to negotiate international politics" (Castañeda &amp; Burtner, 2010, p. 3). Herrera and Hoagland (2006) reported on another tourism boycott related to animal welfare concerns: ScubaPoll.com respondents overwhelmingly supported a tourism boycott against Caribbean nations that voted in support of Japan's brutal slaughter of whales at the International Whaling Commission. Similarly, research on whale-watching tourists in Iceland showed that 79% of respondents expressed intentions to boycott trips to countries that were actively engaged in hunting whales (Parsons &amp; Rawles, 2003). Both studies described the motivational cause of each boycott and relevant boycott intentions through survey results; however, they did not examine actual boycott impacts in terms of decreased visitor numbers to these boycotted countries. Hudson (2007) discussed an ethical issue in tourism boycotts, namely whether such boycotts were ethical for local communities.

        <p>although Burma Campaign UK called for a tourism boycott to Myanmar (formerly known as Burma) in 2006 so as not to fund the military government via travel, respondents were generally in favour of tourism in Myanmar and believed human-rights-conscious travel did more good for the country (Hudson, 2007). Teye and Diffenderfer's (1988) study represents the only attempt to measure the impacts of tourism boycotts using tourism figures. They discussed the 1980s tourism boycott against Arizona over the Martin Luther King holiday controversy; findings revealed an estimated loss of $25.6 million affecting all major sectors of the tourism industry due to the cancellation of 48 conventions during the boycott's first year (Teye &amp; Diffenderfer, 1988). Nevertheless, although they reported an estimated loss in tourism income, their work was brief and descriptive; it did not measure the actual decline in visitor numbers.although Burma Campaign UK called for a tourism boycott to Myanmar (formerly known as Burma) in 2006 so as not to fund the military government via travel, respondents were generally in favour of tourism in Myanmar and believed human-rights-conscious travel did more good for the country (Hudson, 2007).

        <p>Boycotts are powerful acts that are public, information-forcing, and may cause real damage to boycotted businesses or communities (Lee, 2012); thus, it is disappointing that existing research has not investigated the actual impacts of tourism boycotts numerically. This lack of attention raises an important research question about the actual effects of tourism boycotts in terms of the prolonged decrease in visitor numbers over time. An answer to this question can help destination management organisations better plan, predict, and manage their resource allocation in an effort to rescue their respective tourism economies from the impacts of tourism boycotts.Boycotts are powerful acts that are public, information-forcing, and may cause real damage to boycotted businesses or communities (Lee, 2012); thus, it is disappointing that existing research has not investigated the actual impacts of tourism boycotts numerically.

        <p>Consumer behaviour research has pointed out that animosity is an important motive behind boycotting (Klein et al., 1998;Huang et al., 2010;Little &amp; Singh, 2015), as cognitive appraisal theory suggests that individuals' emotions reflect their beliefs in certain events and can predict subsequent behaviour (Lazarus, 1982). Whilst emotions "evolve to solve evolutionarily relevant problems" (Saad, 2013, p. 355), it is unsurprising that animosity plays a predominant role in tourism boycotts, whatever the purpose of a boycott may befrom angry environmentalists calling for a tourism boycott against whale slaughter to active furious human rights advocates who demand tourism sanctions to certain destinations.Consumer behaviour research has pointed out that animosity is an important motive behind boycotting (Klein et al., 1998;Huang et al., 2010;Little &amp; Singh, 2015), as cognitive appraisal theory suggests that individuals' emotions reflect their beliefs in certain events and can predict subsequent behaviour (Lazarus, 1982).

        <p>Studies of animosity have proposed numerous cause-based classifications, such as historical war/military animosity (e.g. Klein et al., 1998), economic animosity (Ang et al., 2004), political animosity (Russell &amp; Russell, 2006), religious animosity (Riefler &amp; Diamantopoulos, 2007), cultural animosity (Kalliny, Hausman, Saran &amp; Ismaeil, 2017), and people-related/social animosity (Nes et al., 2012). Table 1 provides detailed definitions for different types of animosity.Studies of animosity have proposed numerous cause-based classifications, such as historical war/military animosity (e.g. Klein et al., 1998), economic animosity (Ang et al., 2004), political animosity (Russell &amp; Russell, 2006), religious animosity (Riefler &amp; Diamantopoulos, 2007), cultural animosity (Kalliny, Hausman, Saran &amp; Ismaeil, 2017), and people-related/social animosity (Nes et al., 2012). Table 1 provides detailed definitions for different types of animosity.</p>
        <p>Although a few recent studies within the tourism context have examined the relationship between individuals' animosity and their destination visit intentions, few works have considered how the impact of a boycott might differ based on the type of animosity. For example, Stepchenkova, Shichkova, Kim and Rykhtik (2018) showed that tourists' willingness to visit a destination is influenced by individuals' animosity towards that country in the case of strained bilateral relations. In particular, animosity negatively influenced Russian respondents' perceptions of the US as a tourism destination and their intentions to visit. Using data collected from Turkish consumers, Sánchez, Campo and Alvarez (2018) argued that various types of animosity could influence tourists' travel intentions differently; specifically, political animosity and social animosity were negatively related to visit intention. Campo and Alvarez (2019) also conducted similar research in Spain and reported that animosity was negatively related to individuals' visit intentions. They argued that social and political animosity were important dimensions of the overall animosity construct. However, as criticised before, intentions do not equate to actual behaviour, hence our second research question of whether the impact of a boycott on visitor numbers differs by the type of animosity.Although a few recent studies within the tourism context have examined the relationship between individuals' animosity and their destination visit intentions, few works have considered how the impact of a boycott might differ based on the type of animosity.

        <p>To address the aforementioned research gap and research questions, we examined the effects of tourism boycotts on visitor numbers using Chinese boycott events. We adopted a narrative approach for sample selection (Romer &amp; Romer, 2010) and local projection models for data analysis (Jorda, 2005) to delineate the impacts of tourism boycotts on target destinations' visitor numbers and evaluate how such impacts vary by animosity type. China was selected as the research context as it is the largest tourism source market, accounting for 9% of the world's cross-border travel and a total expenditure over $292 billion in 2015 (World Bank, 2017). Many tourism and hospitality providers have tailored their offerings to target Chinese tourists and boost revenue (Lai, Li &amp; Harrill, 2013). Chinese tourism boycott events may thus pose great risks for many destinations.To address the aforementioned research gap and research questions, we examined the effects of tourism boycotts on visitor numbers using Chinese boycott events.

        <p>We included the following steps in our case selection process. First, using the rankings provided by China Tourism Academy (2017), the think-tank of China's national tourism authority, we narrowed the sample frame to the top 20 most popular overseas destinations amongst Chinese tourists in 2017 because such destinations would be more sensitive to a decline in Chinese visitor numbers in the event of a boycott. Second, to determine whether boycott incidents occurred in these top 20 destinations, we performed keyword searches using the top four search engines -

            <rs type="software">Bing</rs>, 
            <rs type="software">Yahoo</rs>, and

        </p>
        <p>The keywords were "Chinese tourism boycotts + destination name", and we searched for them first in English and then in Mandarin Chinese.

        <p>Then, we used data from each country's national tourism organisation website to extract monthly tourism numbers over the last 10 years. However, we could not obtain the required data for two events: the Chinese tourism boycott of France as a result of French pro-Tibet protests in 2008; and a boycott against Thailand following negative social media comments about Chinese tourists in 2016. In both cases, data on inbound Chinese tourists were unavailable for the period of interest. These events were therefore excluded from our data analysis, leaving seven cases available for further examination.Then, we used data from each country's national tourism organisation website to extract monthly tourism numbers over the last 10 years.

        <p>Case 1 concerned a boycott against the Philippines, representing the evolution of negative emotions when responding to an incident wherein Chinese tourists were hijacked. The Chinese public reacted furiously due to disappointment over the handling of the hijack by the president of the Philippines and their displeasure towards Filipino people's lack of respect for Chinese victims (Chinanews.com, 2011).

        <p>Case 3 was a boycott against the Maldives, which stemmed from a dispute about kettles being removed from hotel rooms for Chinese tourists only. According to hotel management, the decision to remove kettles was made in the hopes that Chinese tourists would order more room service rather than consuming their own instant noodles in their rooms. This discriminative practice sparked social and cultural animosity amongst Chinese tourists and went viral on Sina Weibo, with many users calling for a boycott of the Maldives (Penna, 2013). However, compared to other cases, resort management teams reacted quickly to tackle the issue by stating that the kettles had been removed only for maintenance. This claim was backed up by the Maldives tourism minister, Ahmed Adheeb, who clarified that the authorities would take such incidents seriously if they received formal complaints over alleged discrimination at the country's resorts (Min, 2013).Case 3 was a boycott against the Maldives, which stemmed from a dispute about kettles being removed from hotel rooms for Chinese tourists only.

        <p>The boycott in Case 6 was triggered when Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-Wen, elected in 2016, ignored the Chinese government's call for the 'One-China policy'. Associated with historical and ongoing political tensions between mainland China and Taiwan (Henderson, 2007), this political rejection generated animosity amongst mainland nationalists and led to an urgent call for a tourism boycott against Taiwan. This boycott was further strengthened by the Mainland Chinese government who discouraged tour operators from organising group travel to Taiwan (Horton, 2017).The boycott in Case 6 was triggered when Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-Wen, elected in 2016, ignored the Chinese government's call for the 'One-China policy'.

        <p>From the case descriptions, we identified four out of seven cases that exhibited political animosity; this type refers to animosity generated from the occurrence of an international bilateral political incident often associated with dyadic political hazards or national/regional conflict, such as that involving territory, resources, or political ideology (Arikan &amp; Shenkar, 2013;Nes et al., 2012). These findings are unsurprising, as political issues are regarded as a major driving force behind animosity (Lee, 2012;Huang et al., 2010). Based on our analysis, we separated cases into two categories: boycotts associated with political animosity (Cases 2, 5, 6, and 7) and boycotts associated with non-political animosity (Cases 1, 3, and 4), which included boycotts associated with social, individual, and cultural animosity. Table 2 summarises the seven boycott events into two groups based on animosity type; Appendix 1 provides more details on the seven cases.From the case descriptions, we identified four out of seven cases that exhibited political animosity; this type refers to animosity generated from the occurrence of an international bilateral political incident often associated with dyadic political hazards or national/regional conflict, such as that involving territory, resources, or political ideology (Arikan &amp; Shenkar, 2013;Nes et al., 2012).

        <p>Identifying boycott events exogenous to other variables that may influence tourist numbers was important to local projection in this study. Following the practice of Romer and Romer (2010), we applied a narrative-based approach to identify the timing of boycotts on the basis of primary sources (e.g. press coverage and social media reports) at the time of the event, as outlined above. This approach ensured that each boycott was a standalone event and not intertwined with other tensions. As part of this narrative identification, we sought to obtain confidence that each boycott was exogenous to tourist visits to the destination country and factors that might influence these tourism numbers; specifically, we aimed to ensure that boycotts were neither caused by tourism activity in a given country (e.g. more tourist arrivals in a destination caused the boycott) nor due to other control variables that would otherwise predict tourist visits (Romer &amp; Romer, 2010).Identifying boycott events exogenous to other variables that may influence tourist numbers was important to local projection in this study.

        <p>To obtain confidence of our identification, we tested whether our identified shocks were exogenous in two ways. First, we applied several specifications to our estimations to determine whether including different control variables and lags thereof would affect point estimation of the impact of tourism. If truly exogenous shocks have been identified, the inclusion of these control variables should not influence the results (Romer &amp; Romer, 2010).To obtain confidence of our identification, we tested whether our identified shocks were exogenous in two ways.

        <p>Second, we regressed identified shocks against lagged variables in our analysis to see if prior data patterns predicted future shocks (Romer &amp; Romer, 2010); if the chosen boycott events were exogenous, this should not be the case. Moreover, we ran our specifications by excluding different boycott events one at a time to determine whether one potentially nonexogenous shock was driving our results. If these exogenous events are unrelated to other factors likely to influence tourism numbers (e.g. tourists' income), then a regression of inbound tourists to the destination country/region against these boycotts should yield unbiased, consistent, and asymptotically normal estimators (e.g. Jorda, 2005, Jorda &amp; Kozicki, 2007;Romer &amp; Romer, 2010;Wu et al., 2011):Second, we regressed identified shocks against lagged variables in our analysis to see if prior data patterns predicted future shocks (Romer &amp; Romer, 2010); if the chosen boycott events were exogenous, this should not be the case.

        <p>Although the estimation of Eq. ( 1) should lead to unbiased estimates of 𝛽 𝑖 if boycott events are exogenous, we tested this hypothesis by including controls in our benchmark and robustness test specifications. For benchmark results, we included l lags of the dependent variable in our specification to control for dynamics in tourist numbers, where many effects were likely serially correlated.

        <p>We performed augmented Dickey-Fuller tests on each variable with the null hypothesis that the variable followed a unit root. For each variable in levels, there was insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, as each variable was a unit root; for all variables expressed in growths, the null hypothesis was strongly rejected.

        <p>We tested the sensitivity of our results in three ways. First, we used inbound Chinese tourists to the boycotted destination for 𝑋 𝐶,𝑗,𝑡 in our benchmark regressions and compared these results to the specifications in Eq. ( 2), where 𝑋 𝑊,𝑗,𝑡 denotes global tourist visitors excluding those from China. This check helped to ensure that boycott behaviour was influential rather than an omitted variable affecting the destination country/region beyond Chinese tourists. Second, we included global tourist visits to country j as a control variable (𝑍 𝑗 ) in Eq. ( 2); estimations from these specifications assessed impacts on Chinese tourists to the destination country, controlling for changes in global activity to that country. If a boycott event exerted an equal effect on Chinese and global tourists, then controlling for global tourists when estimating Chinese tourists should return estimates insignificant from zero.We tested the sensitivity of our results in three ways.

        <p>Finally, we analysed the data by destination for each boycott event, applying a similar local projection approach (Jorda, 2005) without pooling data across several destinations. This method followed a similar process as in Eq.

Analysing behaviour on a case-by-case basis allowed for a comprehensive view of the underlying mechanisms shaping boycott behaviour.Finally, we analysed the data by destination for each boycott event, applying a similar local projection approach (Jorda, 2005) without pooling data across several destinations.

        <p>Panel (c) of Figure 2 indicates a smaller estimated initial fall in global tourists to a destination country after a boycott event (18.8%), and this immediate effect was not found to grow with time.

        <p>Figure 3 presents results of the seven Chinese boycotts on a destination-by-destination basis. Data are presented for 6 months prior to a boycott and 12 months after. The vertical line at time t in each pane represents the time of a given event. Inbound tourism figures have been normalised in each pane by dividing by the number of tourists in the month of a boycott to contextualise the percentage change in tourists after the event. For example, a month after the Manila bus hijacking in 2010, Chinese tourists to the Philippines were 45% below where they were prior to the boycott (i.e. 0.55 on the y-axis in the first pane of Figure 3). Further, the trend in tourist growth appears in each pane (straight dashed black line starting from 1 at time t) with 95% confidence intervals, drawn from the standard deviations of growth rates over time horizons for the country/region in question.

        <p>The first four cases revealed an immediate decline in tourist numbers, although this fall did not persist in many cases (especially in the Maldives).

Therefore, Chinese tourist numbers fell significantly in response to boycotts marked by political animosity; such responses were also economically significant, with tourist numbers estimated to be less than half what they would be one year after the boycott if the boycott had not occurred.Although the results of individual cases in Figure 3 were consistent with those in Figure 2, clear heterogeneity applied in all cases.

        <p>In Cases 2, 5, 6, and 7, tourism boycotts were arguably born out of heightened political tension, rendering civil disputes more likely. In all examples except Case 5 (Hong Kong), which revealed no difference in Chinese tourism figures, political animosity boycotts resulted in statistically significant reductions in Chinese tourists 12 months after each event. In Case 2 (Japan), this effect manifested immediately, whereas in the Taiwan and South Korea cases, the effect strengthened over time. Both instances were characterised by initial debates and negotiations between the Chinese government and its counterpart, revealing a possible effect of government involvement in these cases. Although tourism has long been used as a political tool to retaliate against and reward counterparts (Castañeda &amp; Burtner, 2010), the Chinese government did not wield its power in tourism overtly, hence inbound tourist numbers did not exhibit a sharp decline immediately after each event; however, after failed negotiations in both cases, the Chinese government issued travel warnings and recommended that tour operators send groups elsewhere. These measures exemplify the government's primary motive in a boycott intended for economic retaliation, which may force counterparts to alter their political stance (Dillow, 2017). As long as tension persisted between the Chinese government and that of a destination country/region, Chinese arrivals to these areas appeared unlikely to increase.In Cases 2, 5, 6, and 7, tourism boycotts were arguably born out of heightened political tension, rendering civil disputes more likely.

        <p>Conversely, non-political animosity incited by unpredictable events (e.g. accidents) often spawned from dissatisfaction with or disapproval of crisis management at the destinations. In this study, these boycotts were found to exert temporary effects at most on Chinese tourism to destination countries, with tourist numbers falling within the margin of error after 6 months in all cases (see Figure 3). In each of these boycotts, a year after the event, Chinese tourists to these destinations were estimated to be fewer compared with if long-term visitor trends had continued (i.e. beneath the trend line), but this disparity was not statistically different from zero (i.e. within confidence bounds). The cases of the Philippines and Malaysia revealed a noticeable decrease in Chinese tourist arrivals, although arrivals began to rebound after a year.Conversely, non-political animosity incited by unpredictable events (e.g. accidents) often spawned from dissatisfaction with or disapproval of crisis management at the destinations.

        <p>We conducted additional robustness tests to confirm the above analyses.

        <p>However, tourist growth remained statistically significantly lower than would be expected 2 years after the boycott event, demonstrating a slight reversion to where levels would have been without a boycott; that is, growth demonstrated a similar rate to before the boycott, but such growth began from a lower level given the boycott's impact.However, tourist growth remained statistically significantly lower than would be expected 2 years after the boycott event, demonstrating a slight reversion to where levels would have been without a boycott; that is, growth demonstrated a similar rate to before the boycott, but such growth began from a lower level given the boycott's impact.</p>
        <p>We then tested the robustness of our results using quarterly data. This approach enabled us to add income as a control variable in the specifications, measured as the growth rate of real GDP (see Panels [b]-[d] in Figure 1A). The estimated results aligned with our benchmark specification, providing further support that our identification of exogenous boycott events was correct. The number of Chinese tourists was significantly lower 12 months after the boycott event, demonstrating clear heterogeneity between events involving non-political and political animosity.We then tested the robustness of our results using quarterly data.

        <p>We also estimated our specifications by excluding one case at a time to test the robustness of our results to outlier cases (see Panels [e]-[j] in Figure 1A). We estimated the impact of each case associated with non-political/political animosity depending on how the case was classified in Table 2. For example, when excluding Case 1, we evaluated the impact on events associated with non-political animosity. In all cases, results were robust to this sensitivity check; thus, boycotts associated with non-political animosity were estimated not to have significant effects on Chinese tourism, whereas boycotts associated with political animosity resulted in significant declines in Chinese tourists. Although point estimates and confidence bounds changed when dropping each of our seven boycott cases, the results remained the same.We also estimated our specifications by excluding one case at a time to test the robustness of our results to outlier cases (see Panels [e]-[j] in Figure 1A).

        <p>By theoretically articulating and empirically demonstrating the significant effects of tourism boycotts on decreasing visitor numbers and the various impacts between boycotts with political versus non-political animosity, this study contributes to the tourism boycott literature in four ways. First, by summarising key schools of thought regarding boycotts and illustrating how boycotts can be categorised by motivation, purpose, boycott actions, and boycott impacts, we provide a comprehensive framework for understanding and evaluating boycotts and their potential consequences.By theoretically articulating and empirically demonstrating the significant effects of tourism boycotts on decreasing visitor numbers and the various impacts between boycotts with political versus non-political animosity, this study contributes to the tourism boycott literature in four ways.

        <p>Third, by showing that the reduction in visitor numbers varies across boycotts associated with political versus non-political animosity, this paper reveals that animosity type does not only affect tourists' travel intentions (Alvarez &amp; Campo, 2014;Sánchez et al., 2018) but also actual visitor numbers, extending the previous debate on animosity and boycotts. In particular, whilst our findings reveal that boycotts associated with political animosity and non-political animosity differ in their reaction time, decreases in visitor numbers, and enduring effects, we shed new light on studies of tourism boycotts. Although boycotts associated with non-political animosity may quickly lower visitor numbers, boycotts associated with political animosity can result in more enduring damage on long-term tourist arrivals. Our findings also suggest that institutional intervention may worsen the effects of tourism boycotts, as in the cases of Taiwan and South Korea; Chinese inbound tourist numbers to these destinations will likely remain low until the Chinese government lifts its sanction (Jennings, 2018).Third, by showing that the reduction in visitor numbers varies across boycotts associated with political versus non-political animosity, this paper reveals that animosity type does not only affect tourists' travel intentions (Alvarez &amp; Campo, 2014;Sánchez et al., 2018) but also actual visitor numbers, extending the previous debate on animosity and boycotts.

        <p>Finally, this paper describes and highlights boycott behaviour specific to our research context of the Chinese tourism market. Due to collective memories of past national experiences, resulting in a mixture of the glories of Chinese empires and humiliation in the 19 th and 20 th centuries (Carlson, 2009), Chinese consumers' animosity could be easily transferred to boycott behaviour. Such behaviour may be reinforced by state nationalism, manipulated top-down by the state or by popular nationalism (Zhao, 2013). Furthermore, collectivism is rated highly amongst the Chinese (Hofstede, 2007), which may result in a greater chance of collective action and organised boycotts against a particular destination.Finally, this paper describes and highlights boycott behaviour specific to our research context of the Chinese tourism market.

        <p>Whereas boycotts associated with non-political animosity may be sparked by issues such as cultural misunderstandings and/or miscommunication, immediate action must be taken to prevent negative emotions from morphing into animosity. Crisis management teams may be organised to respond to and compensate affected individuals. Social media posts should be updated frequently to provide the public with the latest information (Hall &amp; Page, 2016).Whereas boycotts associated with non-political animosity may be sparked by issues such as cultural misunderstandings and/or miscommunication, immediate action must be taken to prevent negative emotions from morphing into animosity.

        <p>Communication should be transparent to avoid intensifying negative emotions, and the public should be assured that crisis resolution efforts are ongoing. Sincerity and humility are of paramount importance, especially when communicating with consumers from eastern Asian countries given the concept of 'mianzi' ('face') deeply rooted in Confucian culture (Hwang, 1987). As boycotts associated with non-political animosity tend to be temporary, destination tourism authorities should try to reinforce tourists' confidence and express goodwill and respect towards event victims (Richter, 1983). Public relation efforts should seek to restore destination image and reputation.Communication should be transparent to avoid intensifying negative emotions, and the public should be assured that crisis resolution efforts are ongoing.

        <p>Tourism practitioners must also exercise caution when monitoring international markets characterised by political animosity due to historical conflicts; tourism mishaps will likely trigger more profound boycott effects. Over-reliance on a single source market is not advisable, especially in areas with potential for heightened political tension. Tourism is often sensitive to political and diplomatic environments (Moufakkir, 2010); therefore, governmental policymakers should realise the vulnerability of the tourism industry and institute safeguards to reduce or prevent damage when boycotts occur.Tourism practitioners must also exercise caution when monitoring international markets characterised by political animosity due to historical conflicts; tourism mishaps will likely trigger more profound boycott effects.

        <p>Large boycotts may greatly influence a country's image and directly affect all parties in the tourism industry; thus, contingency plans should be discussed frequently. Such plans may include radical sales promotions of flights and hotels to boost tourist demand from other markets, easier and faster visa applications to facilitate destination access, or tailored marketing towards potential customers from other countries/regions. Destination government authorities should also consider local residents' wellbeing along with that of employees and businesses in a boycott to support them effectively during such events (Kim et al., 2016).Large boycotts may greatly influence a country's image and directly affect all parties in the tourism industry; thus, contingency plans should be discussed frequently.

        <p>Although this paper represents a pioneering attempt to empirically evaluate the effects of tourism boycotts on visitor numbers and assess how these effects differ on the basis of animosity, our study does have limitations that open avenues for future investigation.

First, the concepts of animosity and boycotts are inherently complex with various interpretations.</p>
        <p>Although animosity often refers to individuals' emotional responses, close attention is needed when animosity is viewed as a collective phenomenon (Cheng &amp; Wong, 2014); however, it is difficult to trace whether animosity is a genuine individual intrinsic emotion or one triggered and intensified by media reports, moral pressure, or institutional influence. It is also challenging to judge whether animosity remains consistent throughout an event. Animosity can have different and complex causes, mixing military, economic, or social-cultural factors (Campo &amp; Alvarez, 2017). Scholars are thus encouraged to further confirm the linkages between animosity and boycott behaviour.Although animosity often refers to individuals' emotional responses, close attention is needed when animosity is viewed as a collective phenomenon (Cheng &amp; Wong, 2014); however, it is difficult to trace whether animosity is a genuine individual intrinsic emotion or one triggered and intensified by media reports, moral pressure, or institutional influence.

        <p>Third, the effects of boycotts were investigated in this study using data on China as a source market.
