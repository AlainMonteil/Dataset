        <p>This study attempts to understand the role of artificial intelligence-driven big data analytics capability in humanitarian relief operations. These disasters play an important role in mobilizing several organizations to counteract them, but the organizations often find it hard to strike a fine balance between agility and resilience. Operations Management Scholars' opinion remains divided between responsiveness and efficiency. However, to manage unexpected events like disasters, organizations need to be agile and resilient. In previous studies, scholars have adopted the resource-based view or dynamic capability view to explain the combination of resources and capabilities (i.e., technology, agility, and resilience) to explain their performance. However, following some recent scholarly debates, we argue that organizational theories like the resource-based view or dynamic capability view are not suitable enough to explain humanitarian supply chain performance. As the underlying assumptions of the commercial supply chain do not hold true in the case of the humanitarian supply chain. We note this as a potential research gap in the existing literature. Moreover, humanitarian organizations remain sceptical regarding the adoption of artificial intelligence-driven big data analytics capability (AI-BDAC) in the decision-making process. To address these potential gaps, we grounded our theoretical model in the practice-based view which is proposed as an appropriate lens to examine the role of practices that are not rare and are easy to imitate in performance. We used Partial Least Squares (PLS) to test our theoretical model and research hypotheses, using 171 useable responses gathered through a web survey of international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The findings of our study suggest that AI-BDAC is a significant determinant of agility, resilience, and performance of the humanitarian supply chain. Furthermore, the reduction of the level of information complexity (IC) on the paths joining agility, resilience, and performance in the humanitarian supply chain. These results offer some useful theoretical contributions to the contingent view of the practicebased view. In a way, we have tried to establish empirically that the humanitarian supply chain designs are quite different from their commercial counterparts. Hence, the use of a resource-based view or dynamic capability view as theoretical lenses may not help capture true perspectives. Thus, the use of a practice-based view as an alternative theoretical lens provides a better understanding of humanitarian supply chains. We have further outlined the limitations and the future research directions of the study.This study attempts to understand the role of artificial intelligence-driven big data analytics capability in humanitarian relief operations.

        <p>Humanitarian crises have forced disaster relief organizations to develop abilities that combine speed, flexibility, robustness, and the ability to restore normalcy (Gupta et al., 2016;Altay et al., 2018;Altay and Narayanan, 2022). To tackle humanitarian crises, the humanitarian supply chain should be agile and resilient (Ivanov and Das, 2020;Mandal and Dubey, 2021;Queiroz et al., 2020Queiroz et al., , 2021;;Stewart and Ivanov, 2019). Altay et al. (2018) further argue that despite the rich body of literature on agility and resilience, most of the studies have examined these two important attributes of the humanitarian supply chain in isolation. To date, except for a few studies, most of the literature has largely remained silent on the relationship between these two attributes. We note this as a clear research gap.

        <p>The significant rise in disasters has further accelerated the need for the adoption of AI-driven technologies. These will shape global response strategies to tackle the world's most difficult challenges, especially in the humanitarian sector (Pizzi et al., 2020). Besiou et al. (2021) argue that the adoption of data analytics, AI, and other emerging technologies will further help human progress and contribute to achieving UN sustainable development goals. Hence, we argue that the use of digital technology in humanitarian assistance has played a significant role in saving numerous lives and properties (Sandvik et al., 2014;Gupta et al., 2016;Lawson-McDowall et al., 2021;Besiou et al., 2021;Queiroz et al., 2022).The significant rise in disasters has further accelerated the need for the adoption of AI-driven technologies.

        <p>However, the adoption of advanced technology, workforce adoption, and capability building is uniquely challenging because of the scope of humanitarian missions and the multifaceted nature of its stakeholders (Sandvik et al., 2014;Dubey et al., 2019a). Brock and Von Wangenheim (2019) and Watson et al. (2021) provide empirical insights based on leaders' perceptions of how their organizations will shape corporate strategy in the AI and big data analytics era.

        <p>Effective coordination among the different humanitarian supply chain actors depends on the ability of the individual actors to process the acquired information (Altay and Pal, 2014;Mishra et al., 2020). However, Rao and Jarvenpaa (1991) argue that the need to communicate among the group members often distracts the information processing capabilities of the group members. Hence during humanitarian relief operations, the different actors engaged in humanitarian relief operations often need to process large information within a short time (Day et al., 2009). Hence, these demands may lead to information overload. This phenomenon of processing voluminous amounts of information, resulting in information overload, is termed information complexity (Day et al., 2009;Paul and Nazareth, 2010).Effective coordination among the different humanitarian supply chain actors depends on the ability of the individual actors to process the acquired information (Altay and Pal, 2014;Mishra et al., 2020).

        <p>Information complexity is considered a key area of managerial concern (Rao and Jarvenpaa, 1991) and a critical factor moderating the various relations between actual practice and performance (Liu, 2015;Champion et al., 2019). Information complexity often leads to confusion and further depletes the trust formed among the humanitarian actors. This often leads to a rise in opportunistic behavior (Dubey et al., 2019a;Tatham and Kovács, 2010). Hence a reduction of information complexity using emerging technologies may enhance the positive effects of agility and resilience on humanitarian supply chain performance. In previous research, such effects of information complexity have not been addressed or empirically tested.

        <p>Most management scholars have conceptualized agility and resilience as dynamic capabilities (Brusset, 2016;Altay et al., 2018;Yu et al., 2019). However, in this study, we question the suitability of the dynamic capability view (DCV) for humanitarian operations management research on multiple fronts.Most management scholars have conceptualized agility and resilience as dynamic capabilities (Brusset, 2016;Altay et al., 2018;Yu et al., 2019). However, in this study, we question the suitability of the dynamic capability view (DCV) for humanitarian operations management research on multiple fronts.</p>
        <p>Firstly, Teece et al. (1997), grounded their arguments in strategic management, with a focus on how the organization's dynamic capability can help sustain competitive advantage. However, the focus of humanitarian supply chain management is to alleviate the suffering of the victims by providing the right relief materials, at the right time in the right place. Hence, the competitive advantage notion, which applies to the business or firm, may not easily translate to humanitarian operations management research.Firstly, Teece et al.

        <p>Secondly, DCV argues that dynamic capabilities are the organization's ability to integrate, build and reconfigure internal and external competencies, to tackle dynamic and turbulent environments (Teece et al., 1997;Lee and Rha, 2016;Fosso Wamba et al., 2020). Yet humanitarian relief efforts are carried out by multiple actors, each of them being guided by their missions, interests, capacity, and supply chain expertise (Balcik et al., 2010).Secondly, DCV argues that dynamic capabilities are the organization's ability to integrate, build and reconfigure internal and external competencies, to tackle dynamic and turbulent environments (Teece et al., 1997;Lee and Rha, 2016;Fosso Wamba et al., 2020).

        <p>Following Bromiley and Rau (2016a) arguments we posit that the practice-based view (PBV) is a simpler and a far more comprehensive alternative option to the DCV, with which to examine agility and resilience. Practices that help humanitarian relief actors to provide aid to victims affected by disasters include providing food, medicines, and medical support to ensure a quick recovery.Following Bromiley and Rau (2016a) arguments we posit that the practice-based view (PBV) is a simpler and a far more comprehensive alternative option to the DCV, with which to examine agility and resilience.

        <p>We also note there is a clear research gap in the operations management literature of studies, underpinned by theory besides DCV in understanding the relationships between agility, resilience, and humanitarian supply chain performance. Hence, by empirically validating our theoretically derived framework with data gathered from 171 international humanitarian non-governmental organizations, our study offers two major contributions to theory. Firstly, the integration of two theoretical perspectives: PBV (Bromiley and Rau, 2016a) and contingency theory (see, Lawrence and Lorsch, 1967;Sousa and Voss, 2008). This helps to examine the extent to which agility and resilience in the humanitarian supply chain contribute to supply chain performance. Secondly, by recognizing the role of information complexity in the humanitarian supply chain network.We also note there is a clear research gap in the operations management literature of studies, underpinned by theory besides DCV in understanding the relationships between agility, resilience, and humanitarian supply chain performance.

        <p>The remaining part of our paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we have presented the literature review. In the third section, we have discussed our theoretical framework and research hypotheses. In the fourth section, we have set out our mixed-methods research design, involving the collection of data through interviews of managers working for global Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) (n = 17) followed by an online survey of such managers (n = 171). This section also contains information on how we operationalized our constructs, using multi-item scales derived from the literature and how we then analyzed the data. In the fifth section, we have presented the results obtained through statistical analyses. In the sixth section, we discuss the findings, highlighting the relevance of the PBV and contingency theory to explain relationships in the unique context of humanitarian supply chain operations. This is followed by a discussion of our theoretical contributions. We follow this with some thoughts on the implications for managers, specifically around the evidence justifying investment in, and a focus on, AI-driven technologies, to drive enhanced performance. We then acknowledge the limitations of our study, specifically around the online survey, and outline some future research directions. In doing this we call for more work around the applicability of the PBV in this context. Finally, we draw our main conclusions regarding the complex and nuanced relationships between antecedents and moderators of HSCP, encompassing technology factors, culture, organizational agility, resilience, and communications between actors involved in humanitarian disaster relief operations.The remaining part of our paper is organized as follows.

        <p>The practice-based view (PBV) is a relatively new perspective proposed by Bromiley and Rau (2014) as an alternative approach to the resource-based view (RBV) (see, Barney, 1991;Peteraf, 1993). The PBV stems from the logic that even small day-to-day activities of any firm or organization influence their performance. The RBV and the DCV, seek to explain how the resources or the capabilities of the firm generate superior performance for the organization or help to sustain superior performance (Bag et al., 2021). Nevertheless, Bromiley andRau (2014, 2016a) argue that the theory of competitive advantage is only applicable to a few selected firms in an industry and that average firms, which are making small but significant progress, do not meet the eligibility criteria for the application of the RBV/DCV.The practice-based view (PBV) is a relatively new perspective proposed by Bromiley and Rau (2014) as an alternative approach to the resource-based view (RBV) (see, Barney, 1991;Peteraf, 1993).

        <p>Moreover, the RBV or DCV focuses on the explanatory variables that result in competitive advantage (Kovács and Tatham, 2009). However, humanitarian relief efforts involve actors from various organizations to help victims by providing them with necessary relief items and shelter. In such cases, humanitarian operations management scholars need to focus on those common practices that may improve humanitarian supply chain performance.Moreover, the RBV or DCV focuses on the explanatory variables that result in competitive advantage (Kovács and Tatham, 2009).

        <p>There is a common belief among scholars that the management of humanitarian supply chains is a simple application of practices derived from the management of commercial supply chains. Yet some scholars advocate that despite some commonalities, these two types of supply chain are significantly different in terms of objectives (Holguín-Veras et al., 2012). Hence, it requires different kinds of skills to manage humanitarian supply chains efficiently and effectively (e.g., Charles et al., 2010;Holguín-Veras et al., 2012).There is a common belief among scholars that the management of humanitarian supply chains is a simple application of practices derived from the management of commercial supply chains.

        <p>Compared with a commercial supply chain, loss in a humanitarian supply chain is not measured in terms of increased distribution cost or poor on-time delivery (Tatham and Kovács, 2010). A lack of effectiveness or inefficiencies can cause huge losses in terms of the negative impact on the lives of vulnerable people who are stuck in disaster-affected areas. Therefore, to explain humanitarian supply chain performance, the theories of RBV or DCV do not seem appropriate. For instance, the idea of RBV stems from the assumption that those resources that help generate or sustain competitive advantage must be valuable, rare, not easy to imitate and are non-substitutable (V, R, I, N) (Barney, 1991;Peteraf, 1993). However, it is hard to imagine such resources that may help generate a commercial competitive advantage are equally applicable in the context of humanitarian relief efforts. The humanitarian supply chain is often formed rapidly, and the actors involved are working voluntarily (Tatham and Kovács, 2010). Thus, the PBV is far more applicable as it focuses on common practices and performance.Compared with a commercial supply chain, loss in a humanitarian supply chain is not measured in terms of increased distribution cost or poor on-time delivery (Tatham and Kovács, 2010).

        <p>Similarly, the DCV also focuses on the ability to integrate, build and reconfigure internal and external competencies. To create capabilities that help the organization sustain competitive advantage in a highly dynamic or turbulent environment. However, to create such kinds of capabilities organizations need to pursue this as a long-term project, which requires significant investment. Nevertheless, the humanitarian supply chain mostly involves short-lived projects which require an immediate response. Again, instead of DCV, it is the PBV that makes more sense.Similarly, the DCV also focuses on the ability to integrate, build and reconfigure internal and external competencies.

Eckstein et al. (2015) argue that CT is considered a mid-range theory that aims at identifying the situations within the firm's settings that influence performance. CT posits that the organization should adapt its structure and practices to suit the environmental context in which the organization is operating (Donaldson, 2001). CT explains under what contextual situations operations management practices enhance the performance of the organization. Kunz and Gold (2017) argue that humanitarian operations aim at alleviating the suffering of disaster-affected victims in the shortest time, with limited resources. In this context, it is very important to keep in mind that while moving disaster relief materials to the affected victims, the disaster relief workers should consider the local environment. Humanitarian supply chain design needs to align not only to the relief organization's structure but also to the local population's long-term requirements, as well as to any socio-economic and governmental contingency factors (Salam and Khan, 2020). Hence following the tenets of the CT, we argue that the practices of humanitarian organizations, under specific conditions, may provide a better explanation to enhance humanitarian supply chain performance."As operations management (OM) best practices have become mature, research on practices has begun to shift its interest from the justification of the value of those practices to the understanding of the contextual conditions under which they are effective-OM practice contingency research (OM PCR)" (Sousa and Voss, 2008, p.697).

        <p>In recent times we have witnessed a significant rise in the use of the "big data" term. However, in the next few years, such a term may make no sense due to the rapid changes in computing technology and capabilities i.e., the scale of big data today may appear to be small in the next few years (Akter and Wamba, 2019). Moreover, without the application of artificial intelligence (AI) big data will have no usage (Akter et al., 2021;Kankanamge et al., 2021O' Leary, 2013).In recent times we have witnessed a significant rise in the use of the "big data" term.

        <p>Big data is enabling commercial as well as non-profit making organizations to move away from intuitive to data-driven decision-making (Duan et al., 2019). Organizations will use big data to help create value by tackling complex issues and problems in less time, at a relatively low cost (Dwivedi et al., 2021). As a result, the critical role of AI is to generate value by providing organizations with intelligent insights from large data sets (Dubey et al., 2020) and to help capture structured interpretations of large unstructured data sets which constitute nearly 85% of the total volume of big datasets. Sandvik et al. (2014) argue that humanitarian sectors have enormous opportunities to improve their actions using digital technology. In recent disaster relief efforts, the use of mobile phones, social media platforms, geospatial technologies, and various forms of crowdsourcing tools have redefined the way humanitarian crises are identified and tackled, and how information is gathered, analyzed and shared among the various humanitarian actors (Behl and Dutta, 2020;Fan et al., 2021;Kankanamge et al., 2021;Papadopoulos et al., 2017;Sandvik et al., 2014). This has led to attempts to tackle the challenges of humanitarian relief efforts using multidisciplinary approaches, see, for example, Fan et al. (2021).Big data is enabling commercial as well as non-profit making organizations to move away from intuitive to data-driven decision-making (Duan et al., 2019). Organizations will use big data to help create value by tackling complex issues and problems in less time, at a relatively low cost (Dwivedi et al., 2021).

Literature on the role of AI-driven big data analytics on agility and resilience practices to improve humanitarian supply chain performance is still in the infancy stage. Humanitarian organizations are relatively slow to appreciate the importance of this technology to improve their decision-making abilities (Behl et al., 2021). One of the main causes for the slow adoption of AI-driven big data analytics in the humanitarian sector is the lack of proper understanding of the technology.

        <p>The lack of an AI-BD-AC may be one of the factors contributing to the poor adoption of emerging technologies to improve humanitarian relief efforts (Pizzi et al., 2020).

        <p>Supply chain agility has gained significant attention in recent years due to the high degree of supply and demand uncertainties (Lee, 2002). Agility is often defined as a capability of the supply chain that firstly, enables the organization to respond to changes in the shortest possible time. Secondly, being highly responsive in reacting to unpredictable and dynamic changes in the external environment. Thirdly, being flexible in adjusting capabilities to tackle the situation with the support of hard and soft technologies, human resources, and information to beat competitions (Gunasekaran et al., 2019). However, the literature reveals some inconsistencies in conceptualizing the term (Charles et al. 2010). Sometimes, supply chain agility is confused with other similar, but different, concepts, such as adaptability, flexibility, and resilience (Charles et al., 2010). Despite diverse conceptualizations, overall research into supply chain agility shows a rise in consensus emphasizing the ability to deal with and take advantage of uncertainties and volatilities. Through sensing and responding to changes rapidly and flexibly (Eckstein et al., 2015;Fosso Wamba and Akter, 2019;Gligor et al., 2019;2019).Supply chain agility has gained significant attention in recent years due to the high degree of supply and demand uncertainties (Lee, 2002).

        <p>In recent times we have witnessed a significant rise in crises resulting from disasters, including recently, the COVID19 pandemic. This trend has reinvigorated the humanitarian operations management community's focus on agility (Ivanov, 2020;Dubey et al., 2021). Many of the fatalities that have occurred due to the pandemic are primarily due to the lack of adequate resources (i.e., hospital ICU capacity) to deal with the sudden rise in severe cases resulting from people catching the virus (Altay and Pal, 2022). Such humanitarian crises call for agility in the supply chain, to meet the immediate medical needs of those infected. In response to this need Charles et al. (2010, p. 727) identified the following characteristics of humanitarian supply chain agility:In recent times we have witnessed a significant rise in crises resulting from disasters, including recently, the COVID19 pandemic.

        <p>Nevertheless, the resilience of a humanitarian supply chain is far more complex than that of a commercial supply chain (Dennehy et al., 2021). The information sharing and coordination required are more complex due to the unique nature of the humanitarian supply chain, due to the chaotic post-disaster environment, the high variety of public and private actors and the lack of adequate resources. Most of the studies on resilience are from a commercial supply chain perspective and humanitarian supply chain resilience (HSCR) is a relatively recent concept and a less-studied topic (see, Altay et al., 2018;Dennehy et al., 2021). In this study, we conceive humanitarian relief activities, through the lens of a supply chain as a practice rather than a capability. Hence our notion of resilience, in this context, is viewed through the prism of PBV rather than RBV or DCV.Nevertheless, the resilience of a humanitarian supply chain is far more complex than that of a commercial supply chain (Dennehy et al., 2021).

        <p>Our theoretical framework (see Fig. 1) is grounded in the practicebased view (PBV) and contingency theory (CT).

(2018) and Polater (2020) we refer to agility and resilience as two practices that are imitable and can be easily transferred to other similar organizations.

        <p>The humanitarian space is characterized by a chaotic environment. Hence, decision-making is often a complex task. The RBV logic rules out the possibility of the adoption of the processes that make the humanitarian supply chain agile and resilient. Moreover, the RBV and DCV are rooted in the commercial competitive advantage of the firm which is not the aim of any humanitarian organization. Hence, we argue that AI-BD-AC drives the agile and resilient practices of humanitarian organizations, which ultimately helps enhance humanitarian supply chain performance. Moreover, following the arguments of CT, we believe that a reduction in information complexity has a moderating influence on the paths joining agility/resilience and performance. Thus, our research hypotheses are informed by two theories: PBV and CT.The humanitarian space is characterized by a chaotic environment. Hence, decision-making is often a complex task.

        <p>Lee ( 2004) argues that the best-performing organizations do not only care about speed and cost; crucially they respond to unexpected changes in demand and supply in their external markets.

        <p>However, building agility in the humanitarian supply chain is far more complex in comparison to the commercial supply chain (Oloruntoba and Kovacs, 2015;L'Hermitte et al., 2017).

Moreover, the actors engaged in the humanitarian supply chain are quickly brought together, typically from diverse backgrounds, which often leads to trust and coordination issues (Dubey et al., 2019a(Dubey et al., , 2021;;Tatham and Kovács, 2010). Balcik et al.

        <p>AI-BD-AC enables humanitarian organizations to quickly collate and process complex information from diverse sources. Thereby producing solutions that may guide the humanitarian organizations involved in managing the logistics of the disaster relief materials i.e., to redirect shipments from alternate warehouses to reach the victims and thus help save lives. Those organizations that develop visibility in the humanitarian supply chain are well-positioned to invest and develop systems that foster AI-BD-AC (Dubey et al., 2019a).AI-BD-AC enables humanitarian organizations to quickly collate and process complex information from diverse sources.

To mitigate the risk from such events, organizations invest in building their supply chain resilience (Brandon-jones et al., 2014;Li and Zobel, 2020). The recurrent, protracted, and complex nature of many disasters and humanitarian crises further necessitates the need for long-term interventions that help tackle developmental challenges.In recent times supply chain disruptions resulting from disasters have increased significantly (Gupta et al., 2019;Queiroz et al., 2022).

        <p>Agility is seen through the better coordination of disaster assistance, with related community support services and long-term recovery efforts and better disaster planning to recover from crises. Resilience involving recovery is an important phase of a disaster. It is the restoration of all aspects of the disaster's impact on a community and the return of the local economy to some sense of normalcy.Agility is seen through the better coordination of disaster assistance, with related community support services and long-term recovery efforts and better disaster planning to recover from crises.

        <p>The recovery phase can be broken down into two periods. The shortterm phase typically lasts from six months to one year. It involves the delivery of immediate services to victims in the form of medical aid, food, drinking water, building materials to construct damaged infrastructure, clothing, and other necessary materials. Communities must access and deploy a range of public and private resources to enable longterm recovery. Altay et al. (2018) found a positive association between HSCAG and HSCR and humanitarian supply chain performance. Thus, we hypothesize it as: H4. The HSCAG has a positive effect on HSC performance.The recovery phase can be broken down into two periods. The shortterm phase typically lasts from six months to one year.

        <p>The actors belonging to different organizations involved in disaster relief carry their own set of beliefs, values and practices when acting in the supply chain. The diversity often makes sharing of information and coordination of work extremely complex (Balcik et al., 2010;Tatham and Kovács, 2010). Information sharing is often considered a critical aspect of the coordination among humanitarian actors (Altay and Pal, 2014) and poor coordination leads to the wastage of resources (Altay and Labonte, 2014). For example, the failures of the Haiti disaster relief efforts in 2010 were partly attributed to nformation-related issues among humanitarian agencies involved in the response, which revealed a variety of impediments to information flow considerably hindered coordination (Altay and Labonte, 2014).The actors belonging to different organizations involved in disaster relief carry their own set of beliefs, values and practices when acting in the supply chain.

        <p>The processing and the sharing of information are important for effective coordination (Ruesch et al., 2021). Rao and Jarvenpaa (1991) argue that information complexity is a matter of concern that moderates the relationship between practices and performance (Liu, 2015). Moreover, information complexity often leads to chaos and results in a lack of trust among the actors involved in disaster relief operations (Day et al., 2009). Such situations often lead to competition among humanitarian agencies for scarce resources (Dubey et al., 2021;Ruesch et al., 2021). Hence, we hypothesize that: H6a. Information complexity will have a negative moderating effect on the path joining HSCA and the HSC performance H6b.

        <p>Our study adopted a two-stage sequential mixed-methods approach (Boyer and Swink, 2008;Schilke, 2014). In stage one we conducted qualitative field interviews to learn about the practices relevant to humanitarian organizations engaged in disaster relief operations and their effects on performance. As well as to pre-test the survey questionnaire used in stage two. In this second stage, we conducted a cross-sectional survey. This survey gathered data for testing the hypotheses, independent variables, and the dependent variable from the same organizations that had completed a similar survey two years previously.Our study adopted a two-stage sequential mixed-methods approach (Boyer and Swink, 2008;Schilke, 2014).

        <p>We conducted 17 semi-structured interviews (see Appendix A) in July 2017 with high-level managers of the global NGOs who were involved in the relief activities following the 2015 Nepal earthquake and the Chennai Flood. Each interview lasted between 60 and 75 min. The interview was organized into two stages (see Appendix B). Firstly, we asked the managers to share their views on the use of emerging technological tools in their disaster relief works. The AI-driven technology to examine the visual images obtained through satellite, geo-spatial, telecom, and many other images from social media platforms, turned out to be among the most common responses.We conducted 17 semi-structured interviews (see Appendix A) in July 2017 with high-level managers of the global NGOs who were involved in the relief activities following the 2015 Nepal earthquake and the Chennai Flood.

        <p>In the second stage, we further validated our initial research hypotheses by asking how critical the use of AI-driven big data analytics was to improve ways to identify damage.

        <p>There was a high degree of agreement that the use of AI-driven analytics helped to interpret tweets, Facebook posts or other kinds of social media feeds following the disasters. The quick interpretation of these social media feeds further guided the disaster relief workers to respond quickly to the affected areas with humanitarian aid.

        <p>Information sharing among disaster relief workers was now far more convenient and this further enhanced the effectiveness of the cluster approach in providing humanitarian aid to victims. However, some managers were sceptical about the application of AI-driven big data analytics in disaster relief operations. Reflecting different perspectives in the academic literature, some managers suggested that, in any circumstance, the use of AI-driven big data analytics will enhance the organizational practices and their effects on disaster relief performance. On the other hand, some managers suggested that despite the use of emerging technologies, government organizations are reluctant to share satellite images or data with the NGOs, although they might provide useful information.Information sharing among disaster relief workers was now far more convenient and this further enhanced the effectiveness of the cluster approach in providing humanitarian aid to victims.

        <p>In the final and second stages of the interviews, we requested some of the managers to fill out the initial version of the questionnaire to be used in the final survey. We could then determine whether they understood the questions and if we needed to improve the clarity of the wording in the questionnaire.

        <p>The empirical setting of our study is international NGOs involved in disaster relief operations in Nepal and India. The unit of the analysis is that of international NGOs and the questionnaire was designed for completion by a single respondent. Previous research indicates that this unit of analysis (international NGOs) provides a detailed understanding of the adoption of emerging technologies and the supply chain practices that influence the performance of disaster relief operations (Dennehy et al., 2021;Dubey et al., 2019b;Moore et al., 2003).The empirical setting of our study is international NGOs involved in disaster relief operations in Nepal and India.

        <p>We obtained contact details of 1340 NGOs with the assistance of the National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM), which is an apex body of the Government of India (see, Altay et al., 2018). Then we further examined the details of each NGO through a google search and finally identified 640 NGOs that are using emerging technologies in disaster relief operations and have a presence in multiple countries.We obtained contact details of 1340 NGOs with the assistance of the National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM), which is an apex body of the Government of India (see, Altay et al., 2018).

        <p>Hence, our study population consisted of 640 NGOs. The target respondents comprised the senior managers in the NGOs who are knowledgeable about the use of emerging technologies in post-disaster relief operations. We sent e-mail invitations to the 640 NGOs during July 2019. By the end of November 2019, after three waves of reminders, we finally received 171 useable responses -representing a response rate of approximately 26.72%. This response rate is consistent with comparable studies utilizing survey-based research (e.g., Salem et al., 2019). Table 2 provides the demographic profiles of the respondents. As shown in the table, 23.39% of the respondents were executive directors, 9.94% were communication managers, 33.33% were program managers, and the remaining 33.33% were CTOs, chief procurement managers, or logistics managers.Hence, our study population consisted of 640 NGOs.

        <p>We then tested for non-response bias in two ways. Firstly, we examined non-response by comparing the early with late respondents (see, Armstrong and Overton, 1977). The results of the student's t-test yielded no significant differences (p &gt; 0.1) across the means for each measuring item between them. Secondly, following Wagner and Kemmerling (2010) suggestions, we contacted 45 randomly selected non-respondents and asked them to answer one item for each construct of our theoretical model. The resultant t-test yields no significant differences between respondents and non-respondents (p &gt; 0.1). These results provide evidence that non-response bias is not a major concern. We also performed Kruskal Wallis H tests on responses from four different information groups: 1) executive director 2) communication manager 3) program manager and 4) others. We observed no significant differences in responses.We then tested for non-response bias in two ways.

        <p>We used multi-item scales to measure the constructs used in the theoretical model (see Fig. 1). The measurement items used for the operationalization of constructs are listed in Table 3. As shown in the table, we have adapted measures from existing research. We further refined the measurement scales through in-depth interviews with 17 experts -see description in sub-section 4.1 above -following the recommendations of DeVellis and Thorpe (2021). Item sorting and pre-testing were carried out, based on the protocol of Anderson and Gerbing (1991), with seven scholars with knowledge of the field. We undertook further pre-testing of the questionnaire with 32 managers engaged in disaster relief operations.

        <p>In addition to the main constructs of our study, we included some relevant control variables to account for the main differences among various NGOs. Following Bernerth and Aguinis (2016) suggestions we included theoretically and statistically relevant variables i.e., absorptive capacity (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990) and organizational compatibility (Liang et al., 2007). The learning perspective indicates that the use of emerging technologies like AI or big data analytics can be further enhanced if organizations have previous experience with them.In addition to the main constructs of our study, we included some relevant control variables to account for the main differences among various NGOs.

        <p>This perspective is grounded in absorptive capacity theory (see, Cohen and Levinthal, 1990), which is well understood in the context of large commercial organizations' efforts to adopt innovative technologies (see, Liang et al. 2007). We posit that in the case of humanitarian organizations absorptive capacity may influence the intention to use these technologies. To account for this variation, we controlled for the differences among the organizations in terms of their absorptive capacity.This perspective is grounded in absorptive capacity theory (see, Cohen and Levinthal, 1990), which is well understood in the context of large commercial organizations' efforts to adopt innovative technologies (see, Liang et al. 2007).

        <p>We also recognize that the managers of the organizations must have assessed their compatibility issues with various dimensions of the organization, such as objectives, work practices, and organizational culture (Liang et al. 2007). Since humanitarian organizations often operate in different contexts, the organizational criteria for assessment might have changed. Any change in conditions might likely hinder the use of emerging technologies. Hence, we controlled for this variable as due to incompatibility issues, it may influence the results.We also recognize that the managers of the organizations must have assessed their compatibility issues with various dimensions of the organization, such as objectives, work practices, and organizational culture (Liang et al. 2007).

        <p>We report the Cronbach's alpha (α), the factor loadings of the construct items (λi), the scale composite reliability (SCR), and the average variance extracted (AVE) values for the multi-item constructs in Table 4. According to Fornell and Larcker (1981), the multi-item constructs are reliable and valid if each item's factor loadings (λi) are greater than 0.5, the SCR values of each construct are greater than 0.7 and the AVE of each construct is greater than 0.5.

        <p>We recognize that our data, which was collected using a singlerespondent survey, could suffer from common method bias (CMB) (Podsakoff et al., 2003). Following MacKenzie and Podsakoff's (2012) recommendations, we adopted some procedural remedies to reduce the undesirable effects of collecting data from a single source.We recognize that our data, which was collected using a singlerespondent survey, could suffer from common method bias (CMB) (Podsakoff et al., 2003).

        <p>There are many sources of the biases resulting from the questionnaire design. Some of these sources are from overly complex or abstract questions (Doty and Glick, 1998).

        <p>We therefore conducted qualitative interviews to assess the difficulty level in comprehending questions and based on the feedback we reworded some of the questions asked in the questionnaire.

        <p>To minimize the discomfort level of the respondents, we tried to use clear and concise language. We avoided using syntax or providing an explanation so that the respondents did not face any level of difficulty in comprehending the questions. Double-barrelled questions are one of the major sources of biases (Krosnick, 1991;Bradburn et al., 2004). They often present respondents with a dilemma as to whether they answer the first part first or the second part, or both parts. We have avoided the double-barrelled questions. Finally, retrospective questions increase the difficulty of accurate retrieval of information, which put lots of strain on respondents (Krosnick, 1991). Hence, we have asked questions in a way that measures the current state, so that the respondents can answer questions instantly.To minimize the discomfort level of the respondents, we tried to use clear and concise language.

        <p>In addition to procedural remedies, we performed a conservative single factor Harman's test. Scholars find the single factor Harman's test, particularly useful in the case of single informant reported data, not a useful method to assess the common method variance (CMV) (see, Podsakoff et al., 2003;Hulland et al., 2018). Therefore, we used the correlation marker technique to assess CMB (Lindell and Whitney, 2001).In addition to procedural remedies, we performed a conservative single factor Harman's test.

Noting the minimal differences between adjusted and unadjusted correlations. From our results from these tests, we argue that the potential impacts caused by the CMV are non-significant. Furthermore, we considered the moderating effect of the IC on the paths joining HSCA/HSCR and HSC performance. Siemsen et al. (2010) argue that the moderating effects of the variable in a study are less likely to be affected by CMB.We followed Williams et al.

        <p>We recognize that the endogeneity bias often leads to inaccurate estimates and incorrect inferences, which may result in wrong conclusions (Guide and Ketokivi, 2015;Ullah et al., 2018). Endogeneity has been a long-standing problem in the operations management literature (Guide and Ketokivi, 2015). Following Kock's (2017) suggestions, we have reported NLBCDR (nonlinear bivariate causality direction ratio), which estimates the causality. For instance, it helps understand whether the proposed directions (see Fig. 1) are far more stable in comparison to the reverse direction.We recognize that the endogeneity bias often leads to inaccurate estimates and incorrect inferences, which may result in wrong conclusions (Guide and Ketokivi, 2015;Ullah et al., 2018).

All the reverse linkages in our model were weak or not significant.

We found support for H1 (AI-BDAC→HSCA) (β = 0.88, p &lt; 0.01), H2 (AI-BDAC→HSCR) (β = 0.69, p &lt; 0.01), and H3 (β = 0.57, p &lt; 0.01).We tested our research hypotheses using PLS-SEM (WarpPLS 7.0).

        <p>Therefore AI-BDAC explains nearly 78% of the variance in the HSCA (R 2 = 0.78) and 47% of the variance in the HSCR (R 2 = 0.47). Our study empirically supports prior research which found that AI-driven big data analytics decision-making culture offers significant guidance to the disaster relief team, enhancing responsiveness, resilience, and effectiveness (Florez et al., 2015;Rodríguez-Espíndola et al., 2020;Pizzi et al., 2020).Therefore AI-BDAC explains nearly 78% of the variance in the HSCA (R 2 = 0.78) and 47% of the variance in the HSCR (R 2 = 0.47).

        <p>Furthermore, the hypotheses H4 (HSCA→HSCP) (β = 0.69; p &lt; 0.01) and H5 (HSCR→HSCP) (β = 0.38; p &lt; 0.01) were supported, lending Notes: values in bold placed at diagonal are the square root of the AVEs.Furthermore, the hypotheses H4 (HSCA→HSCP) (β = 0.69; p &lt; 0.01) and H5 (HSCR→HSCP) (β = 0.38; p &lt; 0.01) were supported, lending Notes: values in bold placed at diagonal are the square root of the AVEs.</p>
        <p>weight to the claim that agility and resilience in the humanitarian supply chain are highly desirable characteristics (Altay et al., 2018;Ivanov, 2020). The HSCA and HSCR, together with the control variables, explain nearly 19% of the total variance in the HSCP (R 2 = 0.19). Hence, we conclude that HSCA and the HSCR are significant predictors of HSCP.weight to the claim that agility and resilience in the humanitarian supply chain are highly desirable characteristics (Altay et al., 2018;Ivanov, 2020).

Hence, we conclude that HSCA and the HSCR are significant predictors of HSCP.</p>
        <p>Next, we considered the moderation effect of IC on the model. We found a significant moderating effect on the paths joining HSCA and HSCP (β = -0.69, p &lt; 0.01) and HSCR and HSCP (β = -0.56, p &lt; 0.01).Next, we considered the moderation effect of IC on the model.

        <p>From this, we conclude that IC in humanitarian settings is often considered a function of rule and strategic complexities which arise due to different factors, including the large number of disparate actors involved in the disaster relief operations. Most of the time information exchange is hindered due to the different languages spoken by the local and the international actors engaged in relief operations (Balcik et al., 2010).From this, we conclude that IC in humanitarian settings is often considered a function of rule and strategic complexities which arise due to different factors, including the large number of disparate actors involved in the disaster relief operations.

        <p>Moreover, owing to the different beliefs and faith, information exchange is far more difficult. Thus, a reduction in IC may help improve the overall effects of HSCA and HSCR on HSCP. We further found that the absorptive capacity (AC) and the organizational compatibility (OC) have a significant effect on HSCP. The exact role of the AC and OC on the humanitarian supply chain performance and its further association with the other constructs remain interesting questions for future research.Moreover, owing to the different beliefs and faith, information exchange is far more difficult.

        <p>Our study has focused on the role of AI-driven big data analytics culture (AI-BDAC) in building HSCA and HSCR. We examined the combined effects of AI-BDAC, HSCA, and HSCR on HSCP. Our interest in this topic was triggered by two facets of humanitarian relief operations. Firstly, the role of AI-driven big data analytics decision-making culture in disaster relief operations has seen a significant rise among NGOs and government agencies. However, most of these initiatives during humanitarian relief operations are noted in the practitioner literature. Secondly, existing studies have used a resource-based view (RBV)/dynamic capability view (DCV) to explain the humanitarian supply chain performance. AI-BDAC, HSCA, and HSCR are now common practices and most organizations have been practicing them for quite some time now in the wake of the rise in disasters. Moreover, the humanitarian supply chain is designed to save the lives of the victims and alleviate their suffering through providing necessary relief materials in the right condition, at the right time at the right place. Thus, the RBV and the DCV are not appropriate theoretical lenses to examine the role of practices in the humanitarian setting. Under these circumstances, we argue that the practice-based view (PBV), as discussed earlier, is highly relevant, in comparison to the other theories, which are informed by commercial supply chain research.Our study has focused on the role of AI-driven big data analytics culture (AI-BDAC) in building HSCA and HSCR.

        <p>To lend further support to our conceptual model, we also recognized the role of information complexity (IC) in the humanitarian setting. Hence, we have identified IC as a moderating construct. In most cases, disaster relief efforts are negatively affected by a lack of information sharing or by compatibility issues. The moderation effect of IC is useful in explaining the variability in HSCP. Of course, the rigorous test of the usefulness of the moderation effect of IC could be determined only if we have restricted our study to a few organizations to understand how the organization tackles the information complexity issue. This aspect remains an interesting question for future research.To lend further support to our conceptual model, we also recognized the role of information complexity (IC) in the humanitarian setting.

        <p>The results of the study paint an interesting image of the associations and interactions among the variables of AI-BDAC, HSCA, HSCR, and IC. In totality, our findings have implications for theory and practice, as well as offering some new directions for future research in this area. Davenport (2014, p. 147) argues that managers must learn to differentiate between the big data culture and analytics culture as a first step toward building an AI-driven big data analytics culture and calls for further research that test this assertion.The results of the study paint an interesting image of the associations and interactions among the variables of AI-BDAC, HSCA, HSCR, and IC.

        <p>In response, our study provides empirical support that AI-BDAC is significantly linked with HSCA, HSCR, and HSCP. The focus of research on the AI-driven big data analytics culture has been on the team and organizational level competitiveness (Ransbotham et al., 2021). Specifically, AI-driven big data analytics culture has played a significant role in improving trust and collaboration (Glikson and Woolley, 2020). Unfortunately, NGOs engaged in disaster relief efforts have been relatively slow in leveraging AI for analyzing complex data drawn from various sources. Such analysis would allow them to cope better with the humanitarian crisis (van den Homberg et al., 2020).In response, our study provides empirical support that AI-BDAC is significantly linked with HSCA, HSCR, and HSCP.

        <p>The role of AI-BDAC in the context of humanitarian efforts is well discussed in the literature (van den Homberg et al., 2020). What is less understood is how the AI-BDAC affects HSCA and HSCR. This study contributes to enhancing understanding of this area using the practice-based view (PBV) theoretical lens. This is achieved in two ways. Firstly, we focus on how AI-BDAC, HSCA, and HSCR, as distinct practices that are in no way inimitable or rare, influence performance. The humanitarian supply chain practices have been conceptualized as dynamic capabilities (Altay et al., 2018;Matopoulos et al., 2014;Polater, 2020;Tabaklar et al., 2021). However, the dynamic capability view stems from the belief that the resources and capabilities of the organization generate a competitive advantage. However, we argue that humanitarian practices aim to reduce human suffering by providing relief to the affected victims during a disaster and further helping to rebuild infrastructure back to its original state. Hence, in such situations, these practices are not compatible with the RBV or DCV. So, using the PBV to explain how some of these humanitarian practices help enhance performance is far more logical.The role of AI-BDAC in the context of humanitarian efforts is well discussed in the literature (van den Homberg et al., 2020).

        <p>Secondly, Bromiley and Rau (2016a) argue that due to bounded rationality, organizations are not aware of the practices that might benefit them. In such cases, despite being imitable, we argue that the AI-BDAC, HSCA, and HSCR are significant determinants of the humanitarian supply chain performance (HSCP).Secondly, Bromiley and Rau (2016a) argue that due to bounded rationality, organizations are not aware of the practices that might benefit them.

        <p>The two main components of the PBV are the dependent variable and the independent variables (see, Bromiley and Rau, 2016a, p. 101). To address the first component of the PBV we derived RQ1: What are the effects of agility and resilience on the humanitarian supply chain performance? To address RQ1 we empirically tested the paths joining HSCA/HSCR and HSCP. Our findings suggest that HSCA/HSCR are significant predictors of HSCP. We also tested the direct impact of AI-BDAC on HSCP, finding that it was a strong and positive determinant. These findings further strengthen the PBV, which assumes that practices that are not necessarily rare or inimitable can help achieve desired performance. Thus, our findings of the study extend the Bromiley andRau (2014, 2016a) PBV to explain the complex disaster relief operations. These findings further extend the work of Altay et al. (2018) and Dennehy et al. (2021). Secondly, to explain the differential results in HSCP we assumed the moderating effect of IC on the paths joining the HSCA/HSCR and HSCP. This view is grounded in contingency theory. Thus, we integrate the two perspectives: the PBV and the contingency view.The two main components of the PBV are the dependent variable and the independent variables (see, Bromiley and Rau, 2016a, p. 101).

        <p>Next, to address the second component of the PBV we posited our guiding research question (RQ2): What are the effects of AI-driven big data analytics culture on agility and resilience in the humanitarian supply chain? In response to this RQ2, we empirically tested the relationship between AI-BDAC and HSCA/HSCR, which we found to be significant; a result that further strengthens the earlier work of Bromiley andRau (2014, 2016a) relating to PBV.Next, to address the second component of the PBV we posited our guiding research question (RQ2): What are the effects of AI-driven big data analytics culture on agility and resilience in the humanitarian supply chain?

        <p>Furthermore, considering that research into humanitarian practices is a relatively new discipline that has borrowed theories from established disciplines such as operations management and strategic management, it may require a different theoretical lens to explain the complex problems which are guided by completely different objectives. Hence, we argue that our findings are noteworthy. Our findings show that AI-BDAC has positive and significant effects on HSCA and HSCR. We extend Davenport's (2014) and Davenport and Bean's (2018) arguments to humanitarian organizations which are guided through different objectives.Furthermore, considering that research into humanitarian practices is a relatively new discipline that has borrowed theories from established disciplines such as operations management and strategic management, it may require a different theoretical lens to explain the complex problems which are guided by completely different objectives.

        <p>By performing a moderating test, we addressed our third research question (RQ3): what are the effects of the information complexity on the paths joining agility/resilience and the humanitarian supply chain performance? Our findings suggest how PBV, and contingency further explain the differential effects due to humanitarian supply chain practices, to improve humanitarian supply chain performance. These findings extend the work of Bromiley andRau (2014, 2016a) on PBV and further help explain the coordination required amongst the various humanitarian actors engaged in disaster relief operations. That is needed to tackle a complex humanitarian crisis operating under different constraints. Communication challenges often hinder coordination. Our study findings further strengthen such an assertion made by various scholars in the past (see, Altay and Pal, 2014;Altay and Labonte, 2014;Balcik et al., 2010;Ruesch et al., 2021). Our contribution is noteworthy in this context. The finding that IC hinders the joint effects of the HSCA and HSCR on HSCP further extends the works of Altay and Labonte (2014) and Altay et al.

        <p>This study offers some useful directions to those humanitarian supply chain managers engaged in disaster relief operations. Firstly, humanitarian supply chain managers must appreciate the role of both agility and resilience for performance benefits. In this case, we found that agility and resilience are both desirable properties of the humanitarian supply chain which have a significant impact on humanitarian supply chain performance.This study offers some useful directions to those humanitarian supply chain managers engaged in disaster relief operations.

        <p>Secondly, we found that AI-driven big data analytics capability has a significant effect on the agility and resilience of the humanitarian supply chain. Those humanitarian supply chain managers who make decisions based on an AI-driven big data analytics capability are likely to be more flexible in terms of their delivery of disaster relief materials or in responding to changes of destination.Secondly, we found that AI-driven big data analytics capability has a significant effect on the agility and resilience of the humanitarian supply chain.

        <p>In the past, humanitarian organizations face significant challenges in delivering humanitarian aid at the right time, to the right people at the right place. These challenges are due to a lack of proper information exchange among various humanitarian actors which often led to poor coordination (Altay and Labonte, 2014). AI is useful, as it is a complex system that can imitate the intelligence of human beings. Hence, the information derived using AI-driven technology may offer those involved in humanitarian relief guidance, extra capability to locate victims and sort out issues as fast as possible.In the past, humanitarian organizations face significant challenges in delivering humanitarian aid at the right time, to the right people at the right place.

        <p>In this way, a disaster relief team can minimize suffering and restore normalcy. Thus, NGOs engaged in disaster relief efforts may find our research findings encouraging and encourage them to work towards improving their exploitation of AI-driven big data analytics capability. It may also encourage them to further explore possible ways to improve better coordination among the various relief actors to actors, tackle complex challenges, and avoid costly mistakes.In this way, a disaster relief team can minimize suffering and restore normalcy.

        <p>Thirdly effective, and efficient coordination among disaster relief actors is crucial for the success of disaster relief efforts. However, despite several efforts, information complexity often leads to mistrust amongst humanitarian actors resulting in negative consequences. Such as a rise in opportunistic behavior, that may reduce the effectiveness of agility and resilience and subsequently impact negatively on humanitarian supply chain performance. Our findings recommend managers work on improving the authenticity and reliability of the data generated during disaster relief operations.Thirdly effective, and efficient coordination among disaster relief actors is crucial for the success of disaster relief efforts.

        <p>Whilst we also recommend humanitarian organizations to actively embrace an AI-BDAC, we acknowledge that NGOs face various implementation challenges. As they need to be able to shift their operation base, in response to humanitarian crises and to different geographical locations. Most of the time they recruit local people based on their understanding of the local environment. However, this often leads to communication and compatibility issues that hinder effective coordination amongst disaster relief actors or various agencies involved in the relief efforts. To mitigate these issues, umbrella organizations, such as the United Nations and national governments, need to work together, share information and act in transparent ways, to enhance trust amongst disaster relief teams and provide effective joint responses to affected victims.Whilst we also recommend humanitarian organizations to actively embrace an AI-BDAC, we acknowledge that NGOs face various implementation challenges.

        <p>We have suggested that humanitarian organizations now understand the true implications of AI-BDAC and the need to enhance trust and coordination between different disaster relief actors. The stakeholders, like donors, are increasingly demanding high accountability and transparency in the actions of humanitarian relief organizations (Rodríguez-Espíndola et al., 2020). The donors are far more impatient and less tolerant of the inefficiencies in the contemporary digital era.We have suggested that humanitarian organizations now understand the true implications of AI-BDAC and the need to enhance trust and coordination between different disaster relief actors.

        <p>Our study contributes to understanding the relationships between AI-BDAC and humanitarian practices like HSCA and HSCR. The empirical findings help clarify key humanitarian practices and contingencies that influence humanitarian supply chain performance. These findings point to the striking difference in the practices-performance relationship between settings characterized by information complexity.Our study contributes to understanding the relationships between AI-BDAC and humanitarian practices like HSCA and HSCR.

        <p>Nonetheless, several limitations to our study need to be acknowledged, which may further open the door for future research opportunities. The sample is representative of the international NGO population, but it does not fully represent the true population of agencies involved in a disaster. For instance, the dataset included international NGOs, and, as such, care should be exercised cautiously in terms of the generalizability of the results. We suggest that future research should include more actors i.e., military organizations, government agencies, and commercial organization, to ensure a higher level of variance of information complexity in the dataset. Future study is also needed to determine whether the moderating role of information complexity between HSCA/ HSCR and HSCP extends to other characteristics such as the nature of the organizations and the stage of the evolution of their adoption of AI-BDAC (e.g., early or later adopter).Nonetheless, several limitations to our study need to be acknowledged, which may further open the door for future research opportunities.

        <p>Secondly, we have developed a theoretical model and tested our hypotheses using a survey-based instrument. Although we insured, as far as possible, that the constructs we used were reliable and valid, we acknowledge the limitations of survey-based data. We have used a questionnaire designed for the single informant. Then tried to minimize the level of common method bias (CMB) by adopting several procedural remedies. However, we understand CMB cannot be eliminated totally, which is a weakness of any survey-based research design. Future studies could collect data from multiple sources, which would give rich insights. Although such an approach is challenging, due to the difficulty of getting some organizations to be open and transparent and share data.Secondly, we have developed a theoretical model and tested our hypotheses using a survey-based instrument.

        <p>Thirdly, our study adopted a rather narrow definition of humanitarian practices, which focused on experience-based, rather static routines and which did not include more flexible forms of organizational change. We believe a strand of research, grounded in the interpretivism philosophy (i.e., qualitative research design), would be useful to explore in greater detail the interplay between humanitarian practices and information complexity. Finally, we encourage work to clarify the differences between resources, practices and capabilities, to provide better clarity and to further establish the usefulness, of the practice-based view (PBV). That can be applied to explain the different and complex aspects of managing humanitarian supply chains.Thirdly, our study adopted a rather narrow definition of humanitarian practices, which focused on experience-based, rather static routines and which did not include more flexible forms of organizational change.

        <p>In conclusion, our findings, presented in this paper, suggest that humanitarian practices have far more complicated performance effects than previously studied. These range from AI-driven big data analytics to an artificial intelligence culture, humanitarian supply chain agility, resilience, and resolving any communication challenges. We believe that the findings of our study, and the unanswered questions that our study has raised, can spur further empirical research to help us understand the subtle difference in strategic resources, dynamic capabilities, and practices. That exists in humanitarian settings. Also, to appreciate further the relevance of the PBV and its utility in understanding how to address complex supply chain problems, with minimum efforts, to achieve better coordination and improve the performance of humanitarian relief operations.In conclusion, our findings, presented in this paper, suggest that humanitarian practices have far more complicated performance effects than previously studied.
