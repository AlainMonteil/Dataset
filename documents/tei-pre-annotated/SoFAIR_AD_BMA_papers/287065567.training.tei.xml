        <p>The concept of innovation ecosystems has become popular during the last 15 years, leading to a debate regarding its relevance and conceptual rigor, not the least in this journal. The purpose of this article is to review received definitions of innovation ecosystems and related concepts and to propose a synthesized definition of an innovation ecosystem. The conceptual analysis identifies an unbalanced focus on complementarities, collaboration, and actors in received definitions, and among other things proposes the additional inclusion of competition, substitutes, and artifacts in conceptualizations of innovation ecosystems, leading to the following definition: An innovation ecosystem is the evolving set of actors, activities, and artifacts, and the institutions and relations, including complementary and substitute relations, that are important for the innovative performance of an actor or a population of actors. This definition is compatible with related conceptualizations of innovation systems and natural ecosystems, and the validity of it is illustrated with three empirical examples of innovation ecosystems.</p>
        <p>A systems approach in studies of complex phenomena has a long tradition in a broad range of disciplines. The basic concepts and methodology of the approach have repeatedly been adopted, modified and further developed by new scholarly communities. From time to time this popularity of the approach has resulted in a flurry of derivative concepts, paralleled by popular and less stringent use of them, constituting a phenomenon in itself. 1 In innovation studies, the concept of innovation systems has been widely used, often with different qualifiers such as national innovation systems (Freeman, 1987;Lundvall, 1992) or sectoral innovation systems (Breschi and Malerba, 1997).</p>
        <p>During the last 15 years, the concept of innovation ecosystems has become popular with a rapidly growing literature (cf. Gomes et al., 2018), typically with a business and strategy origin and focus. This focus is in contrast to the dominant policy and institutional focus in the innovation system literature and the two literature streams have so far been largely disconnected, despite the syntactic closeness of the two concepts. The innovation ecosystem concept has moreover become subject to much debate, not the least in this journal. Oh et al. (2016) criticize the concept with regards to its usefulness and distinctiveness in relation to extant conceptualizations of innovation systems and with regards to the biologically inspired "eco" qualifier and its arguably flawed analogy to natural ecosystems. Ritala and Almpanopoulou (2017) agree with the critique that the concept is used ambiguously, but suggest that the concept may nevertheless provide a useful addition to the conceptualizations of innovation and innovation management, and call for more conceptual and empirical rigor. Finally, Baiyere (2018) observes a limited consensus among researchers about what innovation ecosystems actually are, despite the concept's widespread use. The innovation ecosystem concept has thus become not just a metaphor but also a persuasive definition and an essentially contested concept, calling for a conceptual review and analysis. 2 This article is an answer to the call for more conceptual rigor and an attempt to increase consensus by providing an explicit definition. The purpose is to analyze the various received definitions of innovation ecosystems and related concepts and to propose a synthesized definition of an innovation ecosystem.</p>
        <p>Our approach is inspired by conceptual history studies and literature on methodology for conceptual analysis. 3 In general terms conceptualizations of social behavior should balance generality, simplicity, and accuracy (Weick, 1979). More specifically our proposed definition should fulfill certain requirements such as: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.technovation.2019.102098 Received 4 June 2018; Received in revised form 27 May 2019; Accepted 12 November 2019 1. Filling an empirical and/or theoretical need in light of existing concepts 2. Being sufficiently precise, parsimonious, and logically consistent (without circularity) 3. Being possible to operationalize, qualify, typologize and use for taxonomies 4. Being syntactically and semantically compatible with common conceptualizations of related concepts, in our case the concepts system, innovation system and ecosystem</p>
        <p>The conceptual analysis will start with the concept of a system and an innovation system and types thereof as dealt with in selected literature, and then proceed to the notion of an ecosystem before focusing on a structured review of received definitions of the innovation ecosystem concept.</p>
        <p>Before moving into the analysis of the extant definitions of innovation ecosystems, we present an overview of the different syntactic components of the innovation ecosystem concept as such, i.e., the concepts of system, innovation, innovation system, and ecosystem.</p>
        <p>The system concept: A general concept of a system is that it is composed of a set C of components and a set R of relations among these components. Systems analysis is essentially the exercise to characterize C and R. A common characterization of a dynamic open system is in terms of transformation of inputs into outputs through activities performed by agents or actors interacting with an environment. 4 The innovation concept: Innovation has a long conceptual history with many fluid connotations and denotations (Godin, 2015). Most contemporary definitions of 'innovation', seen as an outcome of a process, rest on two defining characteristics, a degree of newness of a change and a degree of usefulness or success in application of something new. The concept of 'new' could mean new to world, new to a nation, new to a firm, etc.</p>
        <p>The innovation system concept: An explicit systems approach to the studies of innovations was first adopted and developed in the economics and policy literature in the 1990s with some antecedents in the late 1980s. 5 A number of conceptualizations of innovation related systems were introduced, such as national, sectoral, regional and corporate innovation systems, see Table 1 for selected ones. The syntactic structure of the received definitions of innovation systems is by and large: A set of components and the causal relations influencing the generation and utilization of innovations and the innovative performance.</p>
        <p>The ecosystem concept: The ecosystem as a concept has its origins in the science of ecology, and it conceptualizes the flow of material and energy. As described by Shaw and Allen (2018, p. 90), it can be defined by "recycling flows of nutrients along pathways made up of living subsystems which are organised into process-orientated roles; connects living and non-living subsystems; energy gradients power recycling of scarce nutrients, e.g. a rainforest".</p>
        <p>The conceptual history of the innovation ecosystem concept differs substantially from the conceptual history of innovation system. The use of the concept took off after the publication of a Harvard Business Review article by Adner (2006), a publication which also provides the probably most widely used definition of innovation ecosystems. He defines an innovation ecosystem as "the collaborative arrangements through which firms combine their individual offerings into a coherent, customer-facing solution" (Adner, 2006, p. 2). The concept has its main roots in the related concept of business ecosystems, as used by Moore (1993) and others.</p>
        <p>Several additional attempts to define or describe innovation ecosystems have been made during recent years. With the caveat that there is a somewhat blurred boundary between explicit definitions and descriptions (we have in general been generous in our interpretation of what should be considered a definition), a salient feature of the literature is that much research uses the concept of innovation ecosystems without explicitly defining it. However, in our systematic review of 120 publications on innovation ecosystems and their key references (see Appendix for method), we identified 21 more or less unique definitions, see Table 2. 6In the analysis of these definitions, we identified seven different themes of definition components (from here on denoted simply as components), which to different degrees are used for defining innovation ecosystems. The only component that occurs across all 21 definitions is actors. This can be contrasted with the artifact component (including for example products and technologies), which occurs only in about half of the definitions. The second most common component is collaboration/complements, occurring in 16 definitions. Again, this can be contrasted with the competition/substitute component, which occurs in only six definitions. The third most common component is activities, occurring in 15 definitions. Finally, institutions and co-evolution/co-specialization are occurring in seven definitions each.</p>
        <p>In summary, innovation ecosystem definitions often place emphasis on collaboration/complements and actors, while less commonly so on competition/substitutes and artifacts. Actually, not a single definition includes substitution between artifacts. The concept has become conceptually asymmetrical, which could be argued for if it would have correctly reflected the empirical phenomenon. However, empirical descriptions of innovation ecosystems often identify the importance of not only collaborating but also competing actors (e.g., Rohrbeck et al., 2009;Gawer, 2014;Mantovani and Ruiz-Aliseda, 2016;Hannah and Eisenhardt, 2018) as well as the importance of artifacts (e.g., Carayannis and Campbell, 2009;Nambisan and Baron, 2013) and competing technologies and standards (Arthur, 1989). Gomes et al. (2018) argue that the innovation ecosystem concept has partly come as a reaction to the value capture and competitive focus that was prevalent in the pre-existing business ecosystem literature, and that the innovation ecosystem concept put (more) emphasis on value creation and collaboration. However, in one of the most commonly used references on business ecosystems Moore (1993) actually put equal focus on collaboration and competition: "In a business ecosystem, companies co-evolve capabilities around a new innovation: they work cooperatively and competitively to support new products, satisfy customer needs, and eventually incorporate the next round of innovations" (p. 76). It seems like the shift from the concept of business ecosystems to innovation ecosystems might have overly shifted focus from 4 See, e.g., Ackoff (1971) and Von Bertalanffy (1968) for early general references and, e.g., Carlsson et al. (2002) and Ritala and Almpanopoulou (2017) for later ones more closely related to innovation. 5 If one can speak of some kind of a breakthrough for the systems approach in innovation studies occurring in the 1990s, it might be due to the surge of studies of innovations in general, the quest for meso-level concepts (like industrial clusters, development blocks, regional complexes), the general appeal of the systems approach as used in engineering and the adoption of the systems approach by key opinion leaders in economics and policy analysis. See Granstrand (2000) and Carlsson et al. (2002) for reviews of these concepts and research streams. See also Eklund (2007) for a review and a study of how the innovation system concept became endorsed by OECD and rhetorically adopted and used for political purposes in the case of Sweden.</p>
        <p>competition to collaboration. Moreover, substitution among artifacts and resources, including innovative technologies, is more or less left out from received definitions, despite its relevance in natural ecosystems as well as in artificial ones (cf. the Schumpeterian notion of creative destruction).</p>
        <p>As mentioned above, conceptualizations of social behavior need to balance generality, simplicity, and accuracy (Weick, 1979). Received definitions and conceptual works have been important for pinpointing new systems aspects of innovation, such as strategies to actively design interfaces to achieve complementary benefits across actors. However, by mainly focusing on collaboration between actors, while often leaving competition and artifacts aside, these definitions have sacrificed too much accuracy to gain simplicity. Consequently they tend to be underspecified and overly general, or in other cases not parsimonious enough, see Table 2.</p>
        <p>There are three recurring entities in the reviewed definitions, namely actors, artifacts, and institutions. In addition, our conceptual review identifies activities and relations, especially including collaborative/complementary and competitive/substitute relations, as well as the co-evolving nature of innovation ecosystems. All of these are important components of the innovation ecosystem concept, as highlighted by different definitions. However, no single definition includes them all in a precise, parsimonious, and logically consistent way. Most importantly, we argue that the components of competitors/substitutes and artifacts (including products, technologies, etc.) are missing in many definitions of innovation ecosystems. Including these components would go well in line with the concept of natural/biological ecosystems, which is the inspiration behind the concept of innovation ecosystems. In natural ecosystems different species often compete for the same resources (be it food, water, or light), and when one resource decreases, species might turn to another, substitute, resource, which could then lead to yet another species being outcompeted. Examples of this are countless in natural ecosystems. Similarly, they are very common in innovation ecosystems (see empirical examples below), albeit still not sufficiently accounted for in extant definitions. Therefore we propose the following definition of an innovation ecosystem:</p>
        <p>An innovation ecosystem is the evolving set of actors, activities, and artifacts, and the institutions and relations, including complementary and substitute relations, that are important for the innovative performance of an actor or a population of actors.</p>
        <p>In this definition artifacts include products and services, tangible and intangible resources, technological and non-technological resources, and other types of system inputs and outputs, including innovations. An innovation ecosystem could in other words include an actor system with collaborative (complementary) and competitive (substitute) relations with or without a focal firm, and an artifact system with complementary and substitute relations. 7 Innovative performance is used rather than innovations or innovativeness in order to include related imitations in the system and to facilitate operationalizations in economic terms, and by so doing also avoid circularity. 8 The more precise meaning of 'importance' and ' innovative performance' is left to operationalizations when called for, which renders some flexibility to the concept, not necessarily at the cost of imprecision. The definition is finally syntactically and semantically compatible with various definitions of innovation systems and ecosystems. In summary, the definition is formally in line with the notion of a</p>

        <p>List of definitions of the innovation ecosystem concept (in order of publication year). (Moore, 1993). The three defining characteristics of an innovation ecosystem then are the dependencies established among the members (members' performance and survival are closely linked to those of the ecosystem itself), a common set of goals and objectives (shaped by the ecosystem-level focus on a unique customer value proposition), and a shared set of knowledge and skills (complementary set of technologies and capabilities) (Adner and Kapoor, 2010;Iansiti and Roy, 2004;Teece, 2009).</p>
        <p>Brusoni and Prencipe (2013, p. 168) Times cited: 14 Scholars have proposed the construct of innovation ecosystem to capture the cross-industry and cross-country complexity of the innovation process (see, e.g., Adner, 2006;Iansiti and Levien, 2004;Moore, 1993). Similar to biological ecosystems, innovation ecosystems are inhabited by a variety of different species of actors who share their fate (Moore, 1993). Species operate cooperatively and competitively to create value -that is, they develop and deliver new products, and to capture value -that is, they satisfy customer needs (Adner and Kapoor, 2010). Innovation characterizes the ecosystem in constituting the locus around which species coevolve, and acts as a catalyst for the ecosystem's evolution (Moore, 1993). (Hwang and Horowitt, 2012) and also as consisting of interdependent firms that form symbiotic relationships to create and deliver products and services (Basole and Rouse, 2008). A broader definition sees innovation ecosystems as a network of relationships through which information, talent and financial resources flow through systems, creating sustained value co-creation (Russell et al., 2011), including human networks and firm-level networks as well as the "interorganizational, political, economic, environmental and technological systems of innovation through which a milieu conducive to business growth is catalysed, sustained and supported" (Russell et al., 2011: p. 3). We define a CI ecosystem as a community of actors interacting as a unique system to produce inter-organisational streams of CI. Drawing on Kapoor and Lee (2013), we recognise that firms are increasingly embedded in networks of interdependent activities carried out by external agents. On the one hand, these interdependencies underlie the ability of firms to appropriate returns from investments in CI (Adner and Kapoor, 2010). On the other hand, firms can exploit these interdependencies to sustain efforts of interorganisational CI (Stadler et al., 2013). Thus, CI ecosystems require processes characterised by simultaneous cooperation and competition (Afuah, 2009), and an orchestration of the actors involved in the inter-organisational efforts of CI (Dhanaraj and Parkhe, 2006).</p>
        <p>Times cited: 8 The regional eco-innovation ecosystem is a dynamic system in which organizations influence and are influenced by the interaction of different forces. Times cited: 5 Firms increasingly form 'innovation ecosystems' to implement complex value propositions (e.g. Adner, 2012;Kapoor and Lee, 2013;Nambisan and Baron, 2013;van der Borgh et al., 2012;Williamson and De Meyer, 2012). Defined as "the collaborative arrangements through which firms combine their individual offerings into a coherent, customer-facing solution" (Adner, 2006:98), at the core of an innovation ecosystem, one often finds a technology platform: a set of shared assets, standards, and interfaces that underpins an activity system surrounding it (Gawer, 2014;Thomas et al., 2014). system. It is general, yet reasonably precise and parsimonious (simple), and in line with the general notion of a dynamic system. Fig. 1 depicts the main components of our proposed definition. Some comments can be made in relation to the figure. Relations (arrows) are of multiple different characters. Within entity types, for example between two actors or between two artifacts, they may include complementary and substitute relations, and between entity types they may include ownership and usage rights, transformative relations, and externalities. Institutions refer to "the rules of the game" (North, 1990). The institutional relations are understated in the figure, as are the evolving nature of the innovation ecosystem as well as the relations between multiple innovation ecosystems.</p>
        <p>The empirical validity of our proposed definition of innovation ecosystems can be illustrated by means of three empirical cases. They have been selected on the basis of being well-documented in previous literature without being doctored in advance to fit our definition.</p>
        <p>The multi-level "systems competition" between Sony's Betamax ecosystem and JVC's VHS ecosystem in the 1970s and 1980s is by now a classical case, well documented in the literature (e.g., Granstrand, 1984;Rosenbloom and Cusumano, 1987;Cusumano et al., 1992;Grindley, 1995). The two competing artifact systems, Betamax and VHS, were by and large functional substitutes with incompatible competing standards for video cassette recorders (VCRs) (Granstrand, 1984). 9 Sony was a first mover in the mid-1970s on the compact consumer VCR market. Sony, with the proprietary Betamax standard, was initially adverse to collaborate with others on Betamax development partly due a tradition of being the innovative leader and partly due to bad experiences from compromising in previous standardization attempts (Cusumano et al., 1992). The second mover JVC responded to Sony's first move by actively building up a group of collaborators and licensees (including Hitachi and Sharp) of JVC's VHS technology. This licensing was on favorable terms for licensees and premised upon intragroup cross-licensing of production experience and process improvements across group members (Granstrand, 1984). The JVC business strategy was innovative at the time, in fact invented by JVC's marketing director, Mr. Takano, assisted by JVCs R&amp;D director Mr. Shiraish, and could be labeled a true business model innovation. The enabling of substitutes among both VCRs and cassettes through generous licensing opened up for a mix of competition and collaboration (i.e., coopetition) among the actors in the VHS innovation ecosystem, which over time led to lower prices and increasing value of the VHS offering, including an increasing amount and variation of artifacts, both in terms of hardware products and movie content adapted to the VHS format 10 , and Betamax eventually became outcompeted. Sony finally gave in and bought a VHS license from JVC, as did others who migrated from the Betamax ecosystem to the VHS ecosystem (Ibid.), whereby the actor systems of the Betamax and VHS ecosystems essentially merged, while the Betamax artifact system was replaced by VHS through substitution. Thus, JVC succeeded in outcompeting the first mover by building and managing an innovation ecosystem that allowed for both complements and substitutes among artifacts and both collaboration and competition among actors, in technology development processes as well as in in product sales.</p>
        <p>The case of the development of mobile telecommunication systems illustrates evolving innovation ecosystems over several decades, involving shifts between different technological generations. In this sequence of generation shifts the artifact system was radically transformed through creative destruction with entries and exits, as was the actor system. In each generation there was one or more technical compatibility standard(s), which enabled complementarities across a set of components in the system. An institutionalized standardization process provided a selection mechanism to filter out each standard from a set of competing technical solutions, around which a group of actors was formed, usually governed in part by (cross-)licensing agreements (Bekkers et al., 2002). Each selected standard in turn competed with other standards. Most standards also competed, at least partially, with a preceding generation of the standard, thereby causing cannibalization of sales within and across actors. Thus there was competition at several levels among substitutes with regards to capturing value from complementarities. The complexity of mobile telecommunications systems required interorganizational coordination beyond what competitive markets by themselves likely could accomplish through prices. Thus, already in the first generation standard a collaborative group of at the time monopolistic national telecom operators in the Nordic countries was formed in order to govern the development and launch of the so called NMT system. This activity involved organizing groups of competing suppliers of various key components in the artifact system (terminals, exchanges, and radio base stations) as well as groups of competing distributors and retailers for the various telecom market segments (Granstrand, 1993). Timing regarding technological and industrial capabilities was essential since a pre-mature roll out of a communication network without available complements such as terminals, sufficiently powerful integrated circuits, and high capacity exchanges would incur high costs as well as competitive disadvantages in relation to competing systems. A similar strategy was used in the second generation when the so called GSM group was formed, mainly on a European basis initially. By then institutional changes in form of deregulation and liberalization of telecom markets were taking place (Lindmark, 2002). Competing standards and systems started to emerge together with new entrants, and even more so in later generations. 9 What is less known is that Betamax and VHS had overlapping technology bases with a certain amount of patent cross-licensing taking place between the competitors Sony and JVC, who in that respect were cooperative technologically (i.e., Sony and JVC were coopetitors), intertwining the two innovation ecosystems.</p>
        <p>10 E.g., pornographic movies were sold on VHS. This type of movies were arguably what we today would call a "killer application" in certain customer segments.</p>
        <p>Institutional changes in form of an evolving pro-patent era also strongly influenced the innovation ecosystem from being largely unaffected to becoming increasingly patent licensing and litigation intensive, thus impacting the nature of collaboration and competition (Holgersson et al., 2018;Granstrand, 2018).</p>
        <p>One of the main actors in the mobile telecommunications ecosystem was Nokia, an active contributor to telecommunication standards and the world's largest mobile phone manufacturer during the first decade of the 2000s. However, after the introduction of Apple's iPhone, Nokia quickly lost its lead, which led its CEO Steve Elop to famously acknowledge: "Our competitors aren't taking our market share with devices; they are taking our market share with their entire ecosystem." 11The most important one among these competitors was Apple. In its work with the music player iPod, Apple had successfully positioned itself as a systems integrator and managed to build up an ecosystem of complementary technologies and actors, including content providers (record companies/music publishers) (Schoemaker et al., 2018). Applying the same strategy in mobile telecommunications and smartphones proved to be extremely successful. By strictly controlling the smartphone hardware and operating system with a proprietary IP strategy while opening up for a plethora of complementary innovators in apps and contents, Apple managed to balance collaboration and competition (Hannah and Eisenhardt, 2018), both regarding competition between itself and complementary actors (e.g., in terms of how to split revenues from content sales), and competition between the different complementary actors (e.g., between different gaming apps). Apple's innovation ecosystem allowed for successful complementors to reap sufficient, and sometimes huge, returns from their innovations (e.g., King with its Candy Crash Saga), while at the same time allowing for competition among app providers, all in all leading to a dynamic innovation ecosystem in which complementary innovators were continuously providing new value to customers, part of which Apple could tap into and appropriate (e.g., Grant, 2016).</p>
        <p>These three cases, briefly described here but well documented in the literature, illustrate the presence of all the defining characteristics of an innovation ecosystem as proposed in this article, including the presence of complementary as well as substitute relations in the sub-systems of actors, activities and artifacts, together with relations between them involving rights allocation through market transactions, including licensing rights, and non-market relations in form of externalities, especially positive network externalities, all governed by institutions. Competitive relations existed on multiple levels both in the artifact and actor systems, and mixed with cooperative relations into coopetition in all cases (cf. Hannah and Eisenhardt, 2018). Technical compatibility standards, often with some shared technologies, played a key role in creating value as well as capturing value within and between actor groups in all cases.</p>
        <p>In contrast to the Apple case the VCR case and the mobile telecommunications case both illustrated multi-centric ecosystems and in contrast to the VCR case and the Apple case the mobile telecommunications case illustrated how an innovation ecosystem evolved over a sequence of generation shifts with creative destruction taking place in the artifact system as well as in the actor system, with a manageable rather than a rigid coupling between these two processes. In line with the spirit of a systems approach, innovation ecosystems could be decomposed into several innovation ecosystems, in which case they may compete or complement each other (cf. Adner and Kapoor, 2010). This is not the least illustrated by the connections between the general multi-centric mobile telecommunications innovation ecosystems, and Apple's own firm-centric innovation ecosystem.</p>
        <p>The three cases all represent major radical innovations in systems technologies in electronic industries. This calls into question whether our innovation ecosystem concept has similar descriptive and explanatory power in other industries and for minor or less radical innovations. The genericness of complementary and substitute relations and the prevalence of actors, activities, artifacts, and institutions across industries suggest that the concept is generally applicable, albeit perhaps some components of it are less warranted for minor or less radical innovations. However, as digital technologies are entering into more and more industries, the relevance of all components of the innovation ecosystem concept will likely increase due to the connected and generic nature of such technologies.</p>
        <p>Innovations create value by definition, being new to all and useful to some actors, but also tend to destroy value, being harmful to some actors (Schumpeter, 1942). The complementary and substitute effects from innovations, especially economically major and technologically radical ones, typically interact and propagate outside buyer and seller populations on a narrowly defined market. This justifies a systems approach in innovation analysis, an approach that was developed by economists in the 1980s and 90s, generating a rich stream of literature on various types of innovation systems with a main focus on actors and institutions, while a related literature in economic history of technology focused more on artifacts in technological systems (cf. Carlsson et al., 2002). Another concept introduced in the 1990s was that of a business ecosystem, often with an innovation-related business focus (Moore, 1993).</p>
        <p>In light of all these preceding concepts, a valid question is if there is a need for the concept of innovation ecosystems (cf. Oh et al., 2016;Ritala and Almpanopoulou, 2017;Baiyere, 2018). We argue that there is, and especially so if the concept is sufficiently well-defined. Our conceptual review shows that received definitions typically focus on collaborating actors, while much less commonly include components of competition/substitution and artifacts (products, services, resources, technologies, etc.). A synthesis of the review shows that actors, artifacts, and activities are all elements in an innovation ecosystem, linked together through relations, including complement and substitute relations. The synthesis also points at the importance of institutions and the evolving nature of innovation ecosystems, and all of these components are included in our proposed definition (see section 4).</p>
        <p>The main contribution with our definition, and with this article more generally, is its focus on complementary/cooperative and substitute/competitive relations (CS-relations for short here) and its focus on the actor system and the artifact system. The focus on the prevalent and often mixed and intertwined CS-relations provides additional precision and a more comprehensive and balanced view of what is going on in an innovation ecosystem compared to the received definitions. The CS-relations moreover enable operationalizations by the use of established concepts such as economies/diseconomies of scope, positive and negative synergies, complementarities, super/sub-additivity, or modularity in economics, and degrees of strategic complements and substitutes in the industrial organization literature.</p>
        <p>The CS-relations also enable theorizing along the lines of cooperative and competitive game theory as well as along the lines of industrial organization, economics and strategy in general. Needless to say, CS-relations are of central interest in management and strategy, as well as in policy-making, for example regarding disruptive innovations (Christensen, 1997) or complementary assets (Teece, 2018), platforms, and modularizations for appropriation of complementarities (Baldwin https://www.engadget.com/2011/02/08/nokia-ceo-stephen-elop-ralliestroops-in-brutally-honest-burnin/. and Henkel, 2015; Jacobides et al., 2018). Dynamic balancing of value creation through "growing the pie" across complements, complementors, collaborating competitors, and consumers, and value sharing ("slicing the pie") among them, while curtailing effects from substitute ecosystems and competitors threatened by value destruction, is key to building up and running a well-performing innovation ecosystem, as illustrated also by our empirical examples. In connection to this, allowing for substitute artifacts and competing actors within (parts of) an innovation ecosystem is sometimes instrumental for the ecosystem's competitiveness in relation to other ecosystems.</p>
        <p>Notice that by focusing on innovation ecosystems we take a more focused approach than, e.g.,Gomes et al. (2018) who mix definitions of innovation ecosystems with business ecosystems (e.g.,Teece, 2007;Santos and Eisenhardt, 2005;Moore, 1993).</p>
        <p>This idea of interconnected actor/artifact/activity subsystems of innovation ecosystems goes well in line with the concept of natural ecosystems, which are typically decomposable into subsystems(Shaw and Allen, 2018).</p>
        <p>Note that the term 'innovative performance' is also used byNelson and Rosenberg (1993).</p>

        <p>Our review is based on a structured search for received definitions of the innovation ecosystem concept. We started the process of identifying definitions by doing a basic search for "innovation ecosystem*" in Web of Science on 25 December 2018. We limited the results to the document types article, review, and editorial, and thereby identified 303 publications. Most of these had hardly any citations, so we limited our sample to the 100 most cited ones, which included articles with four or more citations. In addition, we included the 20 most cited ones from each of the year 2016, 2017, and 2018 to avoid a bias towards old and thereby more cited literature. Due to substantial overlaps with the top 100 articles, this step resulted in 20 additional articles, leading to a total sample of 120 articles which were downloaded.</p>
        <p>For each one of these 120 articles, a text search for "innovation" and "ecosystem" was performed to help find explicit definitions of the innovation ecosystem concept. Definitions were identified in 22 of these articles. 12 Some of these definitions built on previous publications, so the next step was to find definitions in these key references. Many of the key references were already included in our sample, but 18 new publications were identified, out of which four provided explicit definitions of the innovation ecosystem concept. To sum up, the first structured search resulted in 22 definitions, and the analysis of key references from these definitions resulted in four additional definitions, all in all resulting in 26 definitions. However, a few of these were complete overlaps, either in the form of the same author(s) publishing the same definition twice or in the form of author(s) defining the concept by exactly citing an earlier definition. By excluding overlaps, we ended up with a final sample of 21 explicit and unique definitions of the innovation ecosystem concept. This selection process is illustrated in Fig. 2, and the list of identified definitions is presented in Table 2.</p>
        <p>When the definitions had been identified, they were analyzed and the content of each definition was coded using open coding (Berg, 1989). This process led to a list of 24 component codes. These component codes were analyzed in order to find joint themes of codes, leading to seven component themes. For example, codes covering knowledge, resources, products, and platforms all relate to artifacts in the innovation ecosystem, and are therefore thematically grouped within the coding theme artifacts. A few component codes are included in two different component themes. For example, the component code 'co-creation' is part of both 'collaboration' and 'activity', as it is an innovation activity that is performed jointly by several actors. The scheme of component themes was then validated by coding all definitions again, but now based on the higher-level themes instead of open coding, and then comparing the coding. The resulting coding scheme is illustrated in Fig. 3. 12 In this process, we also identified definitions of related concepts such as business ecosystem (Moore, 1993) and entrepreneurial ecosystem (Mason and Brown, 2014).</p>
