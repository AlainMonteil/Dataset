        <p>The article introduces a new dataset that seeks to comprehensively trace developments in the area of digital trade governance. The TAPED (Trade Agreements Provisions on Electronic-Commerce and Data) dataset includes a detailed mapping and coding of all preferential trade agreements that cover chapters, provisions, annexes, and side documents that directly or indirectly regulate digital trade. This article presents the methodology behind TAPED and provides an overview of the evolution of digital trade provisions in preferential trade agreements, highlighting also some emerging trends. It then takes a look at the substance of selected rules found particularly in electronic commerce chapters and maps the diversity of approaches in tackling issues meant to facilitate online trade, such as the customs duty moratorium on electronic transactions or paperless trading, and discusses the very recent rule-making with regard to cross-border data flows. This is of course merely a glimpse of the wealth of information that TAPED provides, and the goal of this article is simply to uncover the great variety and the complexity of the norms found in the preferential trade agreements on digital trade governance, which reveals the value of the dataset.The article introduces a new dataset that seeks to comprehensively trace developments in the area of digital trade governance.

        <p>Digital trade has emerged as an important topic in contemporary international economic law and policy and has moved up on the agenda of many trade negotiators around the world. Yet, the topic is by no means new and the membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO) recognized early on the implications of digitization for trade by launching a Work Programme on E-commerce in 1998. 1 This initiative to examine and, if needed, adjust all pertinent issues including trade in services, trade in goods, intellectual property (IP) protection, and economic development did not however bear any fruit over a period of two decades. Indeed, WTO law, despite some adjustments through the Information Technology Agreement (ITA), 2 its update in 2015, and the Trade Facilitation Agreement,3 is still very much in its pre-Internet state. 4 It can of course be argued that the powerful and far-reaching principles of non-discrimination coupled with the adaptive mechanism of the WTO dispute settlement can easily cover new situations and still provide certainty and predictability for businesses and states to engage in global trade. 5 Such a hypothesis may be however far-fetched and even flawed. Since the Work Programme on E-commerce was launched more than 20 years ago, the picture of global trade has changed in many critical aspects. The significance of digital trade, both in its contribution to the economic growth of many countries and the preoccupation of governments with digital trade-related policies, has grown exponentially. 6 On the one hand, this progress and the changing interests relate to new, previously unknown or not fully developed technological applications, such as mobile telephony or cloud computing, which have become important platforms for business. 7 On the other hand and more vitally, they relate to the Internet as an elemental foundation for innovation with deep economic, social, and cultural implications. 8 The importance of data as a key aspect to essentially all societal activities is critical in this transformation 9 and has been recently clearly acknowledged in trade policy circles. 10 The sweeping transformations brought about by the Internet have also been associated with a palette of new measures that inhibit digital trade, such as, among others, the much talked of 'data localization measures,' which encompass diverse requirements for either localization of data servers and providers, local content policies, or may involve discrimination against not locally based digital services or providers. 11 Against the backdrop of pre-Internet WTO law, many of these disruptive changes have demanded regulatory solutions outside the multilateral trade forum. States around the world have used in particular the venue of preferential trade agreements (PTAs) to fill in some of the gaps of the WTO framework, clarify its applications and beyond that, address the newer trade barriers, and accommodate their striving for seamless digital trade. Quite naturally for developments in preferential trade, the framework that has emerged as a result and now regulates contemporary digital trade is not coherent. It is neither evenly spread across different countries, nor otherwise coordinated. Indeed, it can be messy, fragmented with regard to substantive rules and the countries who endorse them, with both legal entrepreneurs and late comers; it is often power-driven and sometimes curiously not so.Digital trade has emerged as an important topic in contemporary international economic law and policy and has moved up on the agenda of many trade negotiators around the world.

        <p>This article introduces a dataset that seeks to comprehensively trace all these developments in the area of digital trade governance. The Trade Agreements Provisions on Electronic-Commerce and Data (TAPED) dataset includes a detailed mapping and coding of all PTAs that include chapters, provisions, annexes, and side documents that directly or indirectly regulate digital trade. These rules can be found in electronic commerce, services chapters (in particular telecommunications, computer and related, audio-visual and financial services sectors), and IP chapters, as well as in specifically created understandings-for instance, on Information and Communications Technology (ICT) cooperation, government procurement, or in entirely new rules on free data flows. The TAPED dataset provides a helpful basis for comparing digital trade relevant norms scattered in the existing, predominantly bilateral, PTAs. 12 It also gives an important evolutionary perspective on the political processes and the diverging positions of the main actors on digital trade issues, such as the United States (US) and the European Union (EU), and how these have changed over time. The dataset also permits to trace other developments that may be missed if one focuses solely on the US versus EU tensions and covers the important role of other actors, such as Australia, Japan, and the countries of the Pacific Alliance, in advancing new models of digital trade governance.This article introduces a dataset that seeks to comprehensively trace all these developments in the area of digital trade governance.

        <p>We trust that this dataset can be in many ways invaluable to both research and policy, as it allows for a fully-informed understanding of digital trade rules and how these have been shaped over time. As many countries strive to push their digital agendas forward, including in the area of trade, TAPED may help along the way, in particular as to identifying gaps, best practices and pinpointing issues on which there seems to be some consensus among states, which can be then potentially more easily multilateralized. Beyond this and in an effort to link to international relations research, in the elaboration of the TAPED dataset, we have also tried to categorize existing provisions as 'hard' or 'soft,' so as to be able to detect levels of legalization and assess their impact on the domestic regulatory environment. International relations scholars can also make good 12 For some previous attempts with a limited number of agreements, see e.g. Sacha Wunsch-Vincent, ' use of TAPED in identifying models, tracking their global diffusion and thinking about the forces that may have driven this diffusion. 13 Finally and in a normative sense, we hope that the TAPED dataset would permit research and policy recommendations on what should and can be done differently in digital trade governance, so that on the one hand, data-driven innovation can be fostered and sustained, while on the other hand, some important public interests, such as notably the protection of privacy, can be appropriately safeguarded. We view the TAPED dataset as a continued effort, as it will be made available to all to use and further develop under the creative commons (attribution, non-commercial, and share-alike) license on the University of Lucerne website (unilu.ch/taped). 14 This article introduces the TAPED dataset and is structured as follows: Section two briefly explains the methodology used for the creation of TAPED; section three presents an overview of the evolution of digital trade provisions in PTAs and identifies some emerging trends. Section four looks at the substance of the provisions with a deep dive into the existing e-commerce chapters and side agreements. A brief conclusion follows in section five.We trust that this dataset can be in many ways invaluable to both research and policy, as it allows for a fully-informed understanding of digital trade rules and how these have been shaped over time.

        <p>Digital trade as a critical policy topic can be construed in two ways-one narrow and one broad. In the former sense, digital trade is plainly equated to commerce in products and services delivered via the Internet. 15 The second aspect is much broader and has to do with enabling innovation and the free flow of information in the digital networked environment. This difference is not of mere academic interest but has true policy implications, as for instance in the current WTO negotiations, China has promoted a narrow view of digital trade, which focuses on trade in goods online, while the US and others have subscribed for an inclusive approach. 16 It has been the purpose of our dataset to cover issues under both these definitions of digital trade and strive for comprehensiveness. If one wishes, by merely filtering the dataset by countries, it is possible to identify which countries have followed a narrower or a broader approach on digital trade.Digital trade as a critical policy topic can be construed in two ways-one narrow and one broad.

        <p>Unless otherwise specified, we considered as digital trade provisions those explicitly mentioning and referring to electronic commerce, digital trade, and data flows. Several keywords were used as a short-cut to identify such provisions (e.g. 'data,' 'digital,' 'electronic,' 'information and communication,' 'internet,' 'online,' and 'information technology'). As these keywords can appear in different sections besides chapters devoted to electronic commerce or digital trade, we have made a cross-cut analysis of digital trade provisions, regardless where there were found in the text of the PTA. In this sense, our coding also considered commitments that are related to the effective implementation of digital trade provisions, like national treatment (NT) and market access commitments in telecommunications, financial, and computer and related services. With this methodology, we aim for breadth and hope to contribute to the growing literature that systematically maps PTA rules in various trade areas using different analytical approaches. 17 Together with the collection and revision of metadata of these agreements (parties, date of signature, entry into force, etc.), a double-coding of each treaty was done manually and then complemented with the digital mapping of texts using a software designed for computer-assisted qualitative and mixed methods data, text, and multimedia analysis (
            <rs type="software">MAXQDA</rs>). A total of 90 different items were coded, including provisions on digital trade, IP, key services sectors, government procurement, trade in goods, as well as general and specific exceptions. A codebook explaining the questions behind the coding points is made available online together with the dataset. Although we have tried to formulate the coding questions in straightforward and specific terms, it cannot be excluded that some questions suffer from an unintended selection bias, which has to do with history of data governance.

        <p>Our work has not started from scratch, nor has it developed in a scholarly vacuum. We have used the basic framework given through the existing and evolving body of literature in the area of conceptualizations of Big Data and related topics, 18 as well as the existing efforts of creating databases or mapping PTAs. 19 e-commerce provisions in PTAs, 20 this study provides a comprehensive quantitative analysis beyond the PTAs currently in force and notified to the WTO 21 and covers also those agreements that are not notified, those that are signed but not yet in force, and those for which the negotiation has been completed and the text made available. 22 Using the kick-off of the US Digital Agenda (with the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002), and the EU's 2000 Directive on e-commerce 23 as starting points of the PTA proliferation, our dataset includes the revision of 346 PTAs concluded between 2000 and October 2019, 24 which were compiled in pdf format. From those treaties, 184 PTAs include provisions that are related to digital trade, 108 have specific e-commerce provisions and 78 consider dedicated e-commerce chapters and side agreements. In comparison, the most complete analysis made prior to TAPED, only examines 75 WTO-notified PTAs that explicitly include e-commerce provisions. 25 An assessment of the extent of legalization of all coded provisions was also performed, distinguishing between 'soft,' 'mixed,' and 'hard' commitments, as well as the number of provisions and words contained in each agreement that are related to digital trade. 26 We considered as 'soft' those commitments that are not enforceable by the parties. These include 'best effort' provisions like those 'recognizing the importance,' 'working towards,' or 'promoting' a certain objective. Cooperation provisions were considered as non-binding unless an obligation to cooperate in certain areas is made explicit in the treaty, within a specific frame and time. When coding these provisions, we took into account that several treaties use language that initially appears binding (e.g. 'shall') but becomes hortatory by adding another word (e.g. 'shall endeavor'). 27 We classified as 'hard' those commitments that oblige a party to comply with a provision or a principle and which are enforceable by another party. Examples of binding commitments include 'shall,' 'must,' or 'shall take appropriate measures.' We consider an agreement with 'mixed' legalization, if the treaty has both soft and hard commitments in the same coding line, regardless the number of provisions that bear such characteristics. Similarly, we included in this category references to other agreements that are only partially applicable (e.g. some specific provisions of the TRIPS) or if the agreement 'allows' for something that is not explicitly noted in the text (e.g. certain exceptions). To be sure, there are limitations that are inherent to this type of analysis: sometimes different wording of provisions can mean the same thing and vice versa; some interpretations also depend on the context of the treaty, such as its preamble. Similarly, a greater number of words in e-commerce chapters or side agreements may not mean more liberalization of digital trade, although it arguably signifies a greater interest in the subject.Our work has not started from scratch, nor has it developed in a scholarly vacuum.

        <p>AND SOME EMERGING TRENDS From the 346 PTAs reviewed, we found 184 PTAs with provisions related to digital trade. The largest number of provisions is found in e-commerce and IP chapters; overall, the provisions remain however highly heterogeneous, addressing various issues ranging from customs duties and non-discriminatory treatment of digital products to domestic regulatory framework, electronic signatures, consumer protection, data protection, paperless trading, and unsolicited electronic messages. Putting the agreements along a chronological line, it is evident that the inclusion of digital trade provisions in PTAs referring explicitly to electronic commerce is not a recent phenomenon, although it has evolved significantly in the past two decades. The first e-commerce provision is found in the 2000 Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Jordan and the US. 28 Three years later, the 2003 Australia-Singapore FTA (SAFTA) 29 was the first PTA to have a dedicated chapter on e-commerce. At the moment of this writing, specific provisions applicable to e-commerce can be found in 108 PTAs, mostly in dedicated chapters (78 in our dataset).AND SOME EMERGING TRENDS From the 346 PTAs reviewed, we found 184 PTAs with provisions related to digital trade.

        <p>Provisions regarding data flows in particular are found in trade agreements for more than a decade. While the first PTA including such provisions in general terms is the 2007 Korea-US FTA (KORUS), 30 the 2000 New Zealand-Singapore Closer Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) already included a provision considering the transfer of financial information, as well as data processing as part of the financial services commitments. 31 Although the number of PTAs incorporating specific digital trade provisions remains limited, the last eight years have witnessed a significant increase in the number of agreements with such provisions. As shown in Figure 1, digital trade provisions are, on average, included in more than 61% of all PTAs that were concluded between 2010 and 2018. The correlation is even closer, if we consider only the PTAs that have been notified to the WTO. 32 As Willemyns mentions, two-thirds of the WTO Members are party to a PTA with e-commerce related provisions. 33 This rise in the total number of PTAs with digital trade provisions is driven mainly by bilateral agreements: 77% of all trade agreements concluded since 2000 are bilateral, and within that group 83% agreements include digital trade provisions, as it is depicted in Figure 2. The agreements with digital trade provisions are mostly of an intercontinental nature; the Americas and Asia being the most relevant regional areas, as portrayed in Figure 3.Provisions regarding data flows in particular are found in trade agreements for more than a decade.

        <p>The rise of PTAs having digital trade provisions involves both developed and developing countries. Following the country classification of the UN World Economic Situation and Prospects report,34 as of September 2019, 59% of the PTAs with digital trade provisions were negotiated between developed and developing countries and 36% between developing countries. Only 5% of PTAs with e-commerce provisions were negotiated between developed countries, as depicted in Figure 4. Among the PTAs in our dataset, the number of agreements including digital trade provisions has increased significantly over the years. As of October 2019, seven is the average number of PTAs provisions found in e-commerce chapters and side agreements, and if we consider the past five years that average goes up to ten, as shown in Figure 5.The rise of PTAs having digital trade provisions involves both developed and developing countries.

        <p>Among the PTAs with digital trade provisions, it is evident that the level of detail has also increased significantly over the years.

        <p>We now take a deep dive into some substantive areas of the emergent digital trade law, as shaped by PTAs. While in the preceding section, we looked at the digital provisions that are generally found in PTAs; in this section, we focus on selected topics tackled in mostly in dedicated e-commerce chapters, as these tend to include the most comprehensive and binding commitments on digital trade. To structure the overview, we have focused on those provisions within commerce chapters that are also most likely to have a strong impact on domestic regulatory regimes underlying digital technologies and their development. We have tentatively split these provisions into categories that are (i) meant to compensate for the lack of development under the WTO and/or address specific issues raised by the WTO Work Programme on E-Commerce; (ii) meant to enable digital trade by either cutting red tape, by facilitating digital transactions or in general, by making it easier to conduct business online; and (iii) provisions that cover new issues that have not been discussed in the WTO context (the so-called 'WTOextra' issues) and try to address more contentious areas, such as in particular data flows and data protection. Our goal is to uncover the great variety and the complexity of the norms found in the PTAs, which also reveals the value of the TAPED dataset.We now take a deep dive into some substantive areas of the emergent digital trade law, as shaped by PTAs.

Our goal is to uncover the great variety and the complexity of the norms found in the PTAs, which also reveals the value of the TAPED dataset.</p>
        <p>1. Applicability of WTO rules It is commonly assumed that the digital trade provisions in PTAs build upon the rules of the WTO. 35 As a move of regime-shifting, PTAs are also expected to fill in gaps and address some of the questions that have been left open by the multilateral forum. 36 When looking at the e-commerce chapters of PTAs, however, it appears that the majority of PTAs do not include a provision referring to the applicability of WTO rules to e-commerce. From the 108 PTAs that have e-commerce chapters or side agreements, only 48 agreements include such reference, with important differences of language across agreements. Some of the PTAs do explicitly recognize the applicability of the WTO rules to electronic commerce, but do not clearly specify which the relevant rules that would be applied are. Such provisions are found mainly in some of the PTAs to which the EU is a Party, 37 as well as in agreements concluded by Canada and Singapore. 38 A similar provision stipulates that the Parties recognize that WTO rules apply 'to the extent they affect electronic commerce,' 39 or to measures 'affecting electronic commerce' 40 -such provisions are found mainly in agreements concluded by Colombia, South Korea, and the US. In other softer variations, countries merely 'reaffirm' their respective commitments under the WTO Agreements, 41 electronic commerce 'falls within the scope of WTO rules and commitments,' 42 or endeavor to develop their legal framework for electronic commerce applying decisions taken within the WTO framework on this issue. 431.

        <p>One explicit link to the WTO is made through provisions on the so-called 'moratorium on custom duties.' The latter has been one of the frequently discussed issues under the WTO E-Commerce Programme and one that has actually enjoyed, at least partial, support of the WTO membership. Until now, members have continued to extend the obligation not to impose customs duties on electronic transmissions at all Ministerial Conferences since the start of the WTO E-Commerce Work Programme but have failed to make it permanent. 44 The ban on customs duties is one of the most common provisions found in PTAs with digital trade rules (76 agreements) and provides some legal certainty for digital commerce, in particular for trade in downloadable products, such as software, e-books, or music. 45 Despite being commonplace, these commitments have different wording. An earliest type of provisions merely recognizes the 'existing practice of not imposing customs duties on electronic transmissions' between the Parties; 46 with some agreements making it explicit that the practice shall or will be maintained. 47 In certain cases, the agreements make reference to the Work Programme on Electronic Commerce and the Parties pledge to cooperate to make this practice binding in the WTO framework. 48 In few agreements, the parties reserve their right to adjust this practice, consistent with any changes to the WTO Ministerial Decision on this issue. 49 Yet, the most common approach is a provision on a permanent moratorium on duty-free treatment, meaning that no customs duties should be imposed on electronic transmissions and digital products. Here again, there are several variations. Some PTAs plainly stipulate that a party may not apply customs duties on digital products of the other Party, 50 or in more binding terms, 'shall' not impose such duties, 51 or generally not to apply them, as well as any fees or charges on import or export of digital products by electronic means. 52 In certain agreements, mostly concluded by the EU, the parties agree that electronic transmissions shall be considered as the provision of services and for that reason cannot be subject to customs duties. 53 In some of these treaties, instead of referring to electronic transmissions, the parties simply agree not to impose duties on 'deliveries by electronic means.' 54 Another group of PTAs makes it clear that the moratorium extends only to customs duties, fees, or other charges on or in connection with the importation or exportation of digital products, and not to internal taxes, fees, or other charges, provided that are imposed in a manner consistent with the agreement. While some of these treaties give this benefit exclusively to products transmitted or delivered, 55 or imported/exported by electronic means, 56 others extend the moratorium to the content transmitted electronically between persons, 57 regardless of whether digital products are fixed on a carrier medium or transmitted electronically. 58 In certain PTAs, there is an explicit distinction between digital products (which are transmitted by electronic means) and those whose sale occur online but are physically transported over borders. For example, according to some treaties-mainly concluded by Singapore and Colombia-a party shall not apply customs duties on digital products by electronic transmission, and when these are transmitted physically, the customs value is 'only limited to the value of the carrier medium' without including the value of the digital product stored in it. 59 A variation of this provision, usually found in US agreements, uses 'may' instead of 'shall,' making the commitment somewhat less binding. 60 A carrier medium is commonly defined as 'any physical object capable of storing a digital product by any method now known or later developed, and from which a digital product can be perceived, reproduced, or communicated, directly or indirectly, and includes, but is not limited to, an optical medium, a floppy disk, or a magnetic tape.' 61 more recent agreements, the reference to a 'floppy disk' has been replaced by 'electronic means.' 62 An alternative definition considers as carrier medium 'any physical object, as listed under the WTO ITA-1 Attachment A, capable of storing a digital product by any method and from which a digital product can be perceived, reproduced, or communicated directly or indirectly.' 63 Other alternative definitions only consider that goods classified in specific subheadings of the Harmonized System can be considered digital products fixed on a carrier medium. 64 Just one agreement in the dataset leaves the determination of the customs value of an imported carrier medium bearing a digital product to each party, in accordance with the WTO Customs Valuation Agreement. 65 Such variations may seem somewhat technical and dull but they are not without legal impact-for instance, extending the obligation to all digital products regardless of source may be a very practical choice, as determining the origin of a digital product can be complicated, especially in a world where data necessary to create these products can be stored and transmitted through various jurisdictions. 66 In a number of PTAs, the moratorium of customs duties, fees, or charges in connection with the exportation or importation of a digital product by electronic means is explicitly not extended to third countries on a most-favored-nation (MFN) basis. 67 In such agreements, the origin of a digital product takes on additional importance, but only a small number of PTAs raise this issue. For example, in the 2009 Japan-Switzerland EPA, the Parties shall 'foster the development of criteria determining the origin of a digital product, with a view to considering the incorporation of such criteria into the Agreement.' 68 Overall, the issue of the duty-free electronic transmissions shows the link between the WTO discussions and provisions in PTAs. The above brief taxonomy of how different PTAs address it also reveals the striking variations across PTAs with potentially diverging legal effects, despite the relatively narrow and unproblematic legal matter that such a ban on duties imposed on electronic transmissions actually entails.One explicit link to the WTO is made through provisions on the so-called 'moratorium on custom duties.'

        <p>When it comes to specific WTO disciplines, the number of agreements including explicit commitments on non-discrimination is relatively small. Out of the 78 PTAs that have e-commerce chapters or side agreements, only 35 include commitments on NT and 32 agreements on the MFN treatment regarding electronic commerce. noteworthy that the large majority of these provisions is binding. 69 Overall, PTAs' electronic commerce chapters tend to use a very similar wording for NT and MFN commitments. Some agreements, such as the 2014 Pacific Alliance Additional Protocol (PAAP), the 2016 Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the 2018 Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the 2018 US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and the 2019 Japan-US DTA, address both NT and MFN in the same paragraph as part of a general commitment of a non-discriminatory treatment of digital products. 70 Yet, the majority of PTAs lists NT and MFN obligations separately. On NT, the most common wording goes back to the 2003 Singapore-US FTA stipulating that a party shall not accord less favorable treatment to some digital products than it accords to other like digital products, on the basis that they are 'created, produced, published, stored, transmitted, contracted for, commissioned or first made available on commercial terms outside its territory,' or when the author, performer, producer, developer, or distributor of such products is a person of another party or a non-Party; so as otherwise to afford protection to other like digital products in its territory. 71 A variation of this provision, often found in US agreements, uses 'may' instead of 'shall,' potentially making the commitment less binding. 72 Another an alternative found in earlier agreements, further narrows the NT obligation to products digitally delivered 'associated' with the territory of the other party or where the author, performer, producer, developer, or distributor is a person of the other party. 73 A simpler drafting of NT provisions-found in some Japanese PTAs-merely stipulates that neither party shall adopt or maintain measures that accord less favorable treatment to digital products of the other party than it accords to its own like digital products. 74 A somewhat indirect recognition of NT is found in Canada-Peru FTA, where the 69 Only in the recent Brazil-Chile FTA (2018), there is a softer approach, whereby the Parties recognize the existence of a debate in international fora (such as the WTO) on the application of non-discriminatory treatment in commerce carried out by electronic means and undertake to jointly evaluate the results of these discussions, so as to decide on the possible incorporation of norms of non-discrimination of electronically transmitted content (Art. 10.4). 70 'No Party shall accord less favorable treatment to digital products created, produced, published, contracted for, commissioned or first made available on commercial terms in the territory of another Party, or to digital products of which the author, performer, producer, developer or owner is a person of another Party, than it accords to other like digital products' . A footnote sometimes further clarifies that 'to the extent that a digital product of a non-Party is a 'like digital product' , it will qualify as an 'other like digital product' . TPP/CPTPP, Art. 14.4; Singapore-Sri Lanka FTA, Art. 9.4. parties confirm the application of NT for goods to trade conducted by electronic means. 75 As for the MFN obligation, most agreements require that a party shall not accord less favorable treatment to digital products 'created, produced, published, stored, transmitted, contracted for, commissioned or first made commercially available in the territory of another Party' than it accords to like digital products in the territory of a non-party. In the same line, a party shall not accord less favorable treatment to digital products of which 'the author, performer, producer, developer or distributor' is a person of a non-Party. 76 Sometimes 'may' is used instead of 'shall,' which signals a less binding nature. 77 Again, some Japanese PTAs have a simpler wording in the sense that neither party shall adopt or maintain measures that accord less favorable treatment to digital products of the other party than it accords to like digital products of a non-party. 78 In essentially all agreements, there are certain exceptions to the non-discrimination principles, which may relate to subsidies or grants provided by a party, including government-supported loans, guarantees and insurance, 79 government procurement, 80 services supplied in the exercise of governmental authority, 81 broadcasting; 82 or in broader terms to 'electronic transmission of a series of text, video, images, sound recordings, and other products for aural and/or visual reception, and for which the content consumer has no choice over the scheduling of the series.' 83 To clarify these provisions on non-discrimination, several PTAs include a definition of a 'digital product.' This is normally understood as a computer program, text, video, image, sound recording, or other product that is digitally encoded. 84 4.2; Australia-Japan FTA, Art. 13.4.2; Singapore-Turkey FTA, Art. 9.4.1. 78 Japan-Mongolia FTA, Art. 9.4.1(b); Japan-Switzerland FTA, Art. 73.1(b); Japan-Mongolia FTA, Art. 9.4.1(b). 79 Japan-US DTA, Art. 8.2; Singapore-US FTA, Art, 14.3.4; Singapore-Turkey FTA, Art. 9.4.2; Japan-Mongolia FTA, Art. 9.4.2(b); Australia-US FTA, Art. 16.4.3(c); Korea-US FTA, Art. 15.3.5(a); Australia-Japan FTA, Art. 13.4.3(d); Japan-Mongolia FTA, Art. 9.4.2(b); Singapore-Turkey FTA, Art. 9.4.2; TPP/CPTPP, Art. 14.4.3; Australia-Singapore FTA (2016), Ch. 14, Art. 5.3; Singapore-Sri Lanka FTA, Art. 9.4.2; Australia-Peru FTA, Art. 13.4.3. 80 Japan-Mongolia FTA, Art. 9.2(a); India-Singapore ECA, Art. 10.5.2; Australia-Japan FTA, Art. 13 that these are produced for commercial sale or distribution, and can be transmitted electronically, 85 others grant protection regardless of whether they are fixed on a carrier medium or transmitted electronically. 86 Few agreements take the distinctive approach of considering digital products as such that are produced for commercial sale or distribution, and requires them to be transmitted electronically. 87 Some of them explicitly provide that those products fixed on a carrier medium are under the general rules of trade in goods. 88 Finally, certain PTAs apply this definition regardless of whether a Party treats such products as a good or a service under its domestic law. 89 Furthermore, in several treaties, it is explicitly clarified that a digital product does not include a digitized representation of a financial instrument, including money. 90When it comes to specific WTO disciplines, the number of agreements including explicit commitments on non-discrimination is relatively small.

        <p>A group of PTAs with e-commerce chapters (47 treaties) includes provisions to promote and facilitate e-commerce. These provisions are largely non-binding and vary across PTAs. Several agreements explicitly agree to promote the development of electronic commerce only between the parties, 91 or its wider global use or development. 92 Many treaties aim somewhat more concretely to create a favorable environment for global electronic commerce, recognizing the importance of having clear, transparent, and predictable domestic regulation to foster electronic commerce. 93 Other formulations include the need to create an environment of trust and confidence for e-commerce consumers or users; 94 promote interoperability, innovation, and competition; 95 adopt flexible policies taking into account the rapid changes in the technology environment; 96 or address 'issues relevant to the electronic environment.' 97 The 2018 EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) is a notable case that includes specific commitments on domestic regulation, meaning that each party shall ensure that all its measures of general application affecting electronic commerce are administered in a reasonable, objective, and impartial manner. This is accompanied by a best effort commitment not to impose prior authorization or any other requirement having equivalent effect on the provision of services by electronic means. Unless otherwise provided for in its laws and regulations, parties also shall not adopt or maintain measures regulating electronic transactions that deny the legal effect, validity or enforceability of a contract, solely on the grounds that it is concluded by electronic means; or otherwise create obstacles to the use of contracts concluded by electronic means. 98 Facilitation of e-commerce requires more active policies that go beyond its mere promotion. While some PTAs plainly aim to 'facilitate trade in digital products' 99 or through 'electronic means or technologies' , 100 and to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of electronic commerce, 101 or consider e-commerce facilitation as part of general common cooperation activities, 102 other agreements have concrete obligations in this regard. Several treaties include specific commitments to avoid or minimize legal and regulatory barriers to electronic trade, 103 to assist the timeliness and reduce the cost of electronic commercial transactions, 104 as well as apply the principle of technological neutrality. 105 In some treaties, facilitation of e-commerce is taken to a 94 USMCA, Art. 19.2.1; Australia-Singapore FTA (2017), Ch. 14, Art. 2.1; Japan-Mongolia FTA, Art. 9.1. supra-national level. The 2018 USMCA includes as part of the competences of the North American Competitiveness Committee, the identification of priority projects and policies to develop a modern digital trade and investment-related infrastructure.106 Some provisions on facilitation are targeted at specific countries or groups of users. A couple of agreements aim to facilitate the use of electronic commerce by developing countries;107 in certain agreements, Parties endeavor to promote access for persons with disabilities to information and communications technologies 108 or, agree to work together to facilitate women participation in E-commerce. 109 An important number of agreements (45 PTAs) include specific provisions to address the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) 110 in facilitating their use of e-commerce, 111 supporting their growth, 112 or assisting them to overcome obstacles or challenges encountered in the use of e-commerce, usually in non-binding terms under the framework of cooperation activities, 113 like technical assistance. 114 Furthermore, both the USMCA and the Japan-US DTA recognize the importance of SMEs' access to open government data, as well as to interactive computer services. 115A group of PTAs with e-commerce chapters (47 treaties) includes provisions to promote and facilitate e-commerce.

        <p>A significant number of treaties (56 PTAs) includes provisions on paperless trading, which typically cover commitments to make trade administration documents available to the public in electronic form, or accept trade administration documents submitted electronically as the legal equivalent of their paper version. Paperless trading could be applicable between states, between a state and a private entity, or between private entities. These provisions are generally seen as a factor that contributes to the promotion of trade between the parties and significantly enhances the efficiency of trade through the reduction of cost and time. 116 There are three basic types of paperless trading provisions found in PTAs: one typically in the trade in goods chapter, another as part of the cooperation activities between parties, and a third one as part of the ecommerce chapter. These provisions are not mutually exclusive and some agreements include more than one type.A significant number of treaties (56 PTAs) includes provisions on paperless trading, which typically cover commitments to make trade administration documents available to the public in electronic form, or accept trade administration documents submitted electronically as the legal equivalent of their paper version.

        <p>The first agreement with a provision on paperless trading is the 2000 New Zealand-Singapore CEPA, found in the trade in goods chapter, as a way of implementing the Paperless Trading Initiative of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Blueprint for Action on Electronic Commerce. Under this provision, customs administrations shall have in place an electronic environment that supports electronic business applications between them and the trading community. 117 Later agreements make explicit that in implementing such initiatives, customs administrations shall take into account the methodologies agreed by international organizations, such as the World Customs Organization 118 or APEC. 119 A couple of agreements also consider the development of a single governmental customs window following relevant international standards, but recognize that each party shall have its own requirements and conditions. 120 Some PTAs add commitments to exchange views and information between customs administrations and their trading communities, 121 to employ information technology to the greatest extent possible, and electronic means for customs reporting requirements as soon as practicable. 122 Another group of PTAs includes paperless trade provisions as part of cooperation commitments. While some only mention it as one of many collaboration issues, 123 others include a more comprehensive set of rules in a dedicated chapter promoting paperless trading between the parties as one of the overall objectives of the agreement. 124 Some agreements also include cooperation at the international level to enhance the acceptance or use of paperless trading, 125 or taking into account the methods agreed by international organizations. 126 Another type of commitments on paperless trade, usually found in e-commerce chapters, consists of accepting electronic trade administration documents as the legal equivalent of their paper version. Such provisions are usually formulated as best efforts 127 , but can sometimes be mandatory. 128 A group of PTAs also considers making available trade administration documents to the public in electronic form. 129 However, some agreements include exceptions to these commitments-for example, if there is a domestic or international legal requirement to the contrary, or doing so would reduce the effectiveness of the trade administration process. 130The first agreement with a provision on paperless trading is the 2000 New Zealand-Singapore CEPA, found in the trade in goods chapter, as a way of implementing the Paperless Trading Initiative of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Blueprint for Action on Electronic Commerce.

        <p>An important number of trade agreements (68 PTAs) include provisions on electronic authentication, which typically allow authentication technologies and mutual recognition of digital certificates and signatures. The evolution of these provisions goes from earlier treaties having best effort commitments to more binding and mandatory clauses in recent agreements. In 2000, in the very first US-led PTA with e-commerce elements, Jordan and the US declared that their governments should work toward a global approach that supports the recognition and enforcement of electronic transactions and methods of electronic authentication (including electronic signatures), both domestically and internationally. The latter includes joint work on a convention or other arrangements to achieve a common legal approach to support electronic transactions, authentication technologies and implementation models, by adopting relevant provisions from the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on Electronic Commerce. 131 Following the US lead, in 2001, Canada and Costa Rica acknowledged too the necessity of policies to facilitate the use of technologies for authentication and for the conduct of secure e-commerce. 132 In simpler terms, other agreements started to include cooperation commitments on electronic authentication. These cover activities to share information and experiences on laws, regulations, and programs on electronic signatures 133 or secure electronic authentication; 134 and to 'maintain a dialog' on a number of regulatory issues that include the recognition of certificates of electronic signatures issued to the public. 135 Some PTAs specifically address the facilitation of cross-border certification services 136 digital accreditation, 137 or the recognition and facilitation of interoperable cross-border electronic trust and authentication services. 138 Other cooperation activities include research and training activities on electronic signatures and the electronic authentication,139 dedicated seminars and expert meetings on security and interoperability,140 and in general, activities to encourage the use of electronic signatures and certification. 141 More binding commitments on authentication and digital certificates appear since 2004, establishing restrictions on legislation about electronic authentication using both negative and positive obligations. According to the first group of agreements, countries may not adopt or maintain legislation that prevent or prohibit parties to an electronic transaction: (i) from mutually determining appropriate authentication methods; 142 or (ii) from having the opportunity to prove in court that their electronic transaction complies with any legal requirements with respect to authentication. 143 Further commitments on electronic signatures establish that neither party may adopt or maintain legislation that would prevent parties to an electronic transaction from choosing the court or tribunal to which they bring a dispute concerning the transaction, 144 nor denying the legal validity of a signature solely on the basis that the signature is in electronic form, following the framework of the 2005 United Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts. 145 Some of these treaties inscribe this obligation in binding terms ('no Party shall adopt or maintain'). 146 In a second group of agreements, each Party has the positive obligation ('each Party shall adopt or maintain') to apply domestic legislation for electronic authentication that allows Parties to electronic transactions to: (i) determine the appropriate authentication technologies and implementation models, without limiting their recognition and implementation models; and (ii) to have the opportunity to prove in court that their electronic transactions comply with any legal requirements. 147 Some of these agreements add the obligation to adopt measures on electronic authentication that do not limit the recognition of authentication technologies and implementation models. 148 However, many agreements include exceptions to these commitments-for instance, through a requirement of certain performance standards for electronic signatures or methods of authentication in a particular category of sensitive transactions or communications, 149 through certification by an authority or a supplier of certification services accredited under the Party's regulations. 150 Some PTAs explicitly mandate that such 142 EU-Mexico Modernised Global Agreement, Digital Trade Chapter, Art. 6.2; Singapore-Sri Lanka FTA, Art. 9.6.2; Singapore-Turkey FTA, Art. 9.6.2; Japan-Mongolia FTA, Art. 9.5.1; Australia-Japan FTA, Art. 13.6.1; Singapore-Taiwan FTA, Art. 11.5.1(a)(b); Japan-Switzerland FTA, Art. 78.1(a)(b); Korea-US, Art. 15.4.1(a)(b); Chile-Colombia FTA, Art. 12.7; Colombia-US TPA, Art. 15.6; Peru-US TPA, Art. 15.6; Australia-US FTA, Art. 16.5.1. 143 Mexico-Panama FTA, Art. 14.9.1; PAAP, Art. 13.10.1; Colombia-Northern Triangle FTA, Art. 14.7. 144 Japan-Switzerland FTA, Art. 78.1(c). 145 This is done either in negative ('may not maintain'e.g. Singapore-Turkey FTA, Art. 9.6.3.) or positive terms ('a Party shall not deny')e.g. Australia-Indonesia FTA, Art. 13.5.3; Brazil-Chile FTA, Art. 10.6.3; USMCA, Art. 19.6.3; EU-Japan EPA, Art. 8.77.3; Australia-Peru FTA, Art. 13.6.3; Singapore-Sri Lanka FTA, Art. 9.6.3; Argentina-Chile FTA, Art. 11.3.3; Australia-Singapore FTA (2016), Ch. 14, Art. 7.3; Chile-Uruguay FTA, Art. 8.5.3; TPP/CPTPP, Art. 14.6.3. 146 Japan-US DTA, Art. 10.2; Brazil-Chile FTA, Art. 10.6.2; USMCA, Art. 19.6.2; EU-Japan EPA, Art. 8.77.2; Australia-Peru FTA, Art. 13.6.2; Argentina-Chile FTA, Art. 11.3.2; Australia-Singapore FTA (2016), Ch. 14, Art. 7.2; Chile-Uruguay FTA, Art. 8.5.2; TPP/CPTPP, Art. 14.6.2. 147 Australia-Indonesia FTA, Art. 13.5.2; Australia-China FTA, Art. 12.6.1; China-Korea FTA, Art. 13.4.2;An important number of trade agreements (68 PTAs) include provisions on electronic authentication, which typically allow authentication technologies and mutual recognition of digital certificates and signatures.

        <p>requirements are objective, transparent, and non-discriminatory and relate only to the specific characteristics of the category of transactions concerned. 151 In others, such certification must serve a legitimate governmental objective and be substantially related to achieving that objective. 152 One example, where such a higher degree of reliability and security is required is electronic financial transactions. 153 Another set of exceptions applies to transactions or communications, which cannot be made electronically under each party's laws and regulations, 154 or where the validity of electronic signatures may be denied according to its law. 155 Additional commitments on electronic authentication are referred to the recognition of digital certificates, either publicly or privately issued. On public authentication, some agreements consider working toward the recognition of digital certificates at government level, 156 which may be based on internationally accepted standards 157 or on cooperation mechanisms between national accreditation and digital certification authorities for electronic transactions. 158 Some of these mechanisms seek to facilitate the understanding of their electronic signature frameworks by making available relevant information to the other party's competent authorities, 159 or examine the feasibility of mutual recognition agreements on digital/electronic signatures. 160 On private authentication, some PTAs encourage the use of interoperable electronic authentication, 161 electronic trust services, 162 digital certificates, 163 as well as the mutual recognition of digital certificates and electronic signatures, 164 which may include a trusted third-party service 165 and advanced or qualified certificates. 166 For that purpose, Parties may endeavor to facilitate the procedure of accreditation or recognition of suppliers of certification services. 167 The Chile-China FTA (as amended in 2018) also considers the possibility to require electronic signature for specific certificates following international standards to ensure the security of the commercial process. 168 Very few trade agreements contain references to specific international standards and these are notably found in treaties concluded by Australia. When this happens, the most referenced is the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce, which is mentioned in 17 treaties. These provisions have several variations: while some agreements stipulate that each party shall 'maintain' laws and regulations governing electronic transactions based on the 1996 Model Law, 169 others extend that commitment also to the 'adoption' of domestic laws and regulations on that subject matter. Some treaties merely refer to certain aspects of the Model Law, 170 while others seek to 'maintain consistency' with the principles contained in that Model Law. 171 In less binding terms, some PTAs cover best efforts to adopt or maintain such model law, 172 or to do so 'as soon as practicable,' 173 'as appropriate,' 174 or 'to the extent possible. ' 175 C. New rules on digital trade, in particular on digital flows 1. Data-related provisions Data-related provisions are a relatively new phenomenon and can be found primarily in dedicated e-commerce chapters of PTAs. These are rules either referring to the crossborder flow of data or such banning or limiting data localization requirements. Provisions on the cross-border flow of data can however be also found in chapters, dealing with discrete services sectors, where data flows are key or indeed inherent to the very definition of those services 176 -this is particularly valid for the telecommunications and the financial services sectors, as shown in Table 1 below. a. Rules on data flows If we look at the evolution of data flow provisions in PTAs, there has been a sea change over the years. Non-binding provisions on data flows appeared actually quite early. Already in the 2000 Jordan-US FTA, the Joint Statement on Electronic Commerce highlighted the 'need to continue the free flow of information,' although it fell short of including an explicit provision in this regard. The first agreement having such a provision is the 2006 Taiwan-Nicaragua FTA, where as part of the cooperation activities, the parties affirmed the importance of working 'to maintain cross-border flows of information as an essential element to promote a dynamic environment for electronic commerce.'177 A similar wording is used in the 2008 Canada-Peru FTA,178 the 2011 Korea-Peru FTA,179 the 2011 Central America-Mexico FTA,180 the 2013 Colombia-Costa Rica FTA,181 the 2013 Canada-Honduras FTA,182 the 2014 Canada-Korea FTA, 183 and the 2015 Japan-Mongolia FTA. 184 In the same line, in the 2010 Hong-Kong-New Zealand FTA, the parties agreed to ensure that 'their regulatory regimes support the free flow of services, including the development of innovative ways of developing services, using electronic means.' 185 An intermediate type of provisions between 'hard' and 'soft' commitments is found in the 2007 South Korea-US FTA, where the parties, after 'recognizing the importance of the free flow of information in facilitating trade, and acknowledging the importance of protecting personal information,' declare that they 'shall endeavor to refrain from imposing or maintaining unnecessary barriers to electronic information flows across borders.' 186 The 2015 Korea-Vietnam FTA, although without a general provision on data flows, considers that each party shall, to the extent possible, make cooperative efforts with competent authorities when personal data transferred across its borders are leaked. 187 The first agreement having a binding provision on cross-border information flows is the 2014 Mexico-Panama FTA. According to this treaty, each Party 'shall allow its persons and the persons of the other party to transmit electronic information, from and to its territory, when required by said person, in accordance with the applicable legislation on the protection of personal data and taking into consideration international practices.' 188 A much more detailed provision in this regard is found in the 2015 amended version of the PAAP, 189 which is similar to the 2016 TPP that was negotiated at the same time and has since largely influenced all subsequent agreements having data flows provisions.requirements are objective, transparent, and non-discriminatory and relate only to the specific characteristics of the category of transactions concerned. 151 In others, such certification must serve a legitimate governmental objective and be substantially related to achieving that objective. 152 One example, where such a higher degree of reliability and security is required is electronic financial transactions. 153 Another set of exceptions applies to transactions or communications, which cannot be made electronically under each party's laws and regulations, 154 or where the validity of electronic signatures may be denied according to its law. 155 Additional commitments on electronic authentication are referred to the recognition of digital certificates, either publicly or privately issued.

        <p>After recognizing that each Party may have its own regulatory requirements concerning the transfer of information by electronic means, both the PAAP (2015) and the TPP stipulate that each party 'shall allow the cross-border transfer of information by electronic means, including personal information,' when it is for the conduct of the business of a covered person. This shall not prevent a Party from 'adopting or maintaining measures to achieve a legitimate public policy objective, provided that the measure is not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade; and does not impose restrictions on transfers of information greater than are required to achieve the objective.' This provision and indeed the entire e-commerce chapter of TPP were kept without changes in the 2018 CPTPP. 190 Post-TPP/CPTPP, a similarly hard rule on data flows has been incorporated into other trade agreements, largely following the same wording, which include the 2016 Chile-Uruguay FTA, 191 the 2016 Updated SAFTA, 192 the 2017 Argentina-Chile FTA, 193 the 2018 Singapore-Sri Lanka FTA, 194 the 2018 Australia-Peru FTA, 195 the 2018 USMCA, 196 the 2018 Brazil-Chile FTA, 197 the 2019 Australia-Indonesia FTA, and in the 2019 Japan-US DTA. 198 In couple of agreements, such as notably the USMCA, it is further clarified that a measure on restriction of data flows is not considered to achieve a legitimate public policy objective, if it accords different treatment of data transfers solely on the basis that they are cross-border in a manner that modifies the conditions of competition to the detriment of a covered person or the service suppliers of the other party. 199 More recently, different countries have agreed to consider in future negotiations commitments related to cross-border flow of information. Such a clause is found for instance in the 2018 EU-Japan EPA 200 and in the EU-Mexico Global Agreement, currently under negotiation. 201 There, the Parties commit to 'reassess' within three years of the entry into force of the agreement, the need for inclusion of provisions on the free flow of data into the treaty. This is new language is an excellent example of the repositioning of the EU on the issue of data flows, as well as of its wish to couple in due time this deeper commitment with the high standards of the General Data Protection Regulation.After recognizing that each Party may have its own regulatory requirements concerning the transfer of information by electronic means, both the PAAP (2015) and the TPP stipulate that each party 'shall allow the cross-border transfer of information by electronic means, including personal information,' when it is for the conduct of the business of a covered person. This shall not prevent a Party from 'adopting or maintaining measures to achieve a legitimate public policy objective, provided that the measure is not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade; and does not impose restrictions on transfers of information greater than are required to achieve the objective.'

        <p>In recent years, some PTAs have also started to include provisions on data localization, either banning or limiting requirements on the location or use of data. An important difference with the data flows provisions analyzed above is that almost all data localization clauses found in PTAs are of a binding nature. The first agreement including such type of provisions is the 2015 Japan-Mongolia FTA, according to which neither Party 'shall require a service supplier of the other party, an investor of the other party, or an investment of an investor of the other party in the area of the former party, to use or locate computing facilities in that area as a condition for conducting its business' . 202 Later the same year, the 2015 amended version of the PAAP included a similar provision on the use and location of computer facilities, stipulating that no party may require a covered person to use or locate computer facilities in the territory of that party, as a condition for the exercise of its business activity. The agreement adds however that nothing shall prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining measures to achieve a legitimate public policy objective, provided that they are not applied in a manner that constitutes a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination, or a disguised restriction to trade. 203 In 2016, the TPP included a similar provision on location of computing facilities. After recognizing that each Party may have its own regulatory requirements regarding the use of computing facilities, such as those to ensure the security and confidentiality of communications, the TPP stipulates that a covered person shall not be required to use or locate computing facilities in a party's territory as a condition for conducting business in that country. The TPP also considers a legitimate public policy objective exception. Additionally, the TPP requires that such measure does not impose restrictions on the use or location of computing facilities greater than are required to achieve the objective. This provision has been kept without change in the CPTPP. 204 After the TPP/CPTPP, a hard rule on data localization largely following the same wording has been included in the 2016 Chile-Uruguay FTA 205 and the 2016 updated SAFTA. 206 A variation is found in the 2019 Australia-Indonesia FTA, which stipulates that nothing in the agreement shall prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining any measure that it considers necessary for the protection of its 'essential security interests.' 207 An alternative is found in the 2018 Singapore-Sri Lanka FTA, the 2018 Australia-Peru FTA and the 2018 Brazil-Chile FTA, where there is no least restrictive measure requirement, thus coming closer to the PAAP wording than to the TPP/CPTPP template. 208 The USMCA and the Japan-US DTA include yet another variation of these provisions, stipulating that 'no party shall require a covered person to use or locate computing facilities in that party's territory as a condition for conducting business in that territory,' without considering any further exception, except in the latter agreement which includes a special rule for financial services. 209 One of the few provisions on data localization that are not directly binding is found in the 2017 Argentina-Chile FTA. Under this treaty, the parties just 'recognize the importance' of not requiring a person of the other party to use or locate the computer facilities in the territory of that party, as a condition for conducting business in that territory, and pledge to undertake to exchange good practices and current regulatory frameworks regarding location of servers. 210 2. Privacy and data protection 82 PTAs in our dataset include provisions on privacy, usually under the concept of 'data protection.' Yet, the way this data is protected varies considerably and can include a truly mixed bag of binding and non-binding provisions (see Table 2), which is of course symptomatic of the very different positions of the major actors and the inherent tensions between the regulatory goals of data innovation and data protection. 211 We sketch here the general rules found in e-commerce chapters; however, many relevant specific provisions can also be found in the financial and telecommunication services chapters or in dedicated annexes.In recent years, some PTAs have also started to include provisions on data localization, either banning or limiting requirements on the location or use of data.

        <p>Earlier agreements dealing with privacy issues consist of side non-binding declarations of mere programmatic nature. The 2000 Jordan-US FTA includes a Joint Statement on Electronic Commerce, where Parties deem it necessary to ensure the effective protection of privacy in the processing of personal data on global information networks. However, the means for privacy protection are kept 'flexible,' considering that content, usage, and the method for collection of private information differs from industry to industry. Governments should 'encourage' private sector development and implemen- tation of enforcement mechanisms, including preparing guidelines and developing verification and recourse methodologies, recommending the OECD Privacy Guidelines as an appropriate basis for policy development. 212 Similarly, the 2001 Canada-Costa Rica FTA includes a provision on privacy as part of a Joint Statement on Global Electronic Commerce, declaring that privacy 'should be effectively protected with regards to the processing of personal data on global networks,' with both parties agreeing to share information on the functioning of their respective data protection regimes. 213 Later agreements include cooperation activities on enhancing the security of personal data at the international level, in order to improve the level of privacy protection in electronic communications and avoid obstacles to trade that requires transfers of personal data. 214 These activities include sharing information and experiences on regulations, laws, and programs on data protection, 215 or on the overall domestic regime for the protection of personal information; 216 technical assistance in the form of exchange of information and experts, 217 research and training activities; 218 the establishment of joint programs and projects, 219 a 'dialog' 220 or 'consultations' on matters of data protection; 221 or in general, other cooperation mechanisms to ensure the protection of personal data. 222 In a handful of treaties, Parties commit to publish information on personal data protection to users of e-commerce, 223 including how individuals can pursue remedies and how businesses can comply with any legal requirements. 224 PTAs have also dealt with personal data protection with reference to the adoption of domestic standards. While some agreements merely recognize the importance or the benefits of protecting personal information online, 225 in several treaties parties specifically commit to adopt or maintain legislation or regulations that protect the personal data or privacy of 226 These measures are usually in relation to the processing and dissemination of data, 227 which may also include administrative measures 228 or the adoption of non-discriminatory practices. 229 When included, few agreements consider qualifications to this commitment, which may include taking measures deemed 'appropriate and necessary considering the differences in existing systems for personal data protection,' 230 or that the Parties have 'the right to define or regulate their own levels of protection of personal data in pursuit or furtherance of public policy objectives,' and shall not be required to disclose confidential or sensitive information or data. 231 Some PTAs add that in the development of online personal data protection standards, each Party shall take into account existing international standards, 232 as well as criteria or guidelines of relevant international organizations or bodies 233 -such as the APEC Privacy Framework and the OECD Recommendation of the Council concerning Guidelines governing the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data (2013). 234 In recognition that the Parties may take different legal approaches to protecting personal information, some agreements declare that each party should encourage the development of mechanisms to promote compatibility between different regimes. These may include the recognition of regulatory outcomes, whether accorded autonomously or by mutual arrangement, or through broader international frameworks. To this end, the Parties shall endeavor to exchange information on any such mechanisms applied in their jurisdictions and explore ways to extend these or other suitable arrangements to promote compatibility between them. 235 In this context, the 2018 USMCA explicitly recognizes that the APEC Cross-Border Privacy Rules system is a valid mechanism to facilitate cross-border information transfers while protecting personal information. 236 Yet, PTA Parties have also employed more binding tools to protect personal information online. A first option considers the protection of individual privacy in the processing and dissemination of personal data and the protection of confidentiality of individual records and accounts as an exception in specific chapters of the agreementsuch as for trade in services, 237 investment or establishment, 238 movement of persons, 239 telecommunications 240 , and financial services. 241 Certain agreements, mostly EU-led, even have special chapters on protection of personal data, including discrete principles-such as: purpose limitation, data quality and proportionality, transparency, security, right to access, rectification and opposition, restrictions on onward transfers, protection of sensitive data, as well as provisions on enforcement mechanisms, coherence with international commitments and cooperation between the parties in order to ensure an adequate level of protection of personal data. 242 Other agreements merely recognize principles for the collection, processing, and storage of personal data, such as prior consent, legitimacy, purpose, proportionality, quality, safety, responsibility, and information, but without any further detail. 243 The 2018 USMCA was the first US-led PTA to include such a provision recognizing the key principles of limitation on collection, choice, data quality, purpose specification, use limitation, security safeguards, transparency, individual participation, and accountability. 244 That agreement also adds that any restrictions on cross-border flows of personal information are necessary and proportionate to the risks presented. 245 A second option lets countries adopt appropriate measures to ensure the privacy protection while allowing the free movement of data, establishing a criterion of 'equivalence'-meaning that countries agree that personal data may be exchanged only where the receiving party undertakes to protect such data in at least an equivalent, similar or adequate way to the one applicable to that particular case in the party that supplies it. This has been largely the EU approach and to that end, Parties commit to inform each other of their applicable rules and negotiate reciprocal, general, or specific agreements. 246 In the same line, under the Argentina-Chile FTA, Parties undertake to apply to data from the other Party, a level of protection that is 'at least similar to that applicable to the Party from which the data originates,' through mutual, general, or specific agreements. 247 A third, but less used option, leaves the development of rules on data protection to a treaty body. The 2012 Colombia-EU-Peru FTA (which also now includes Ecuador), allows the trade committee to establish a working group with the task of proposing guidelines and strategies enabling the signatory Andean countries 'to become a safe harbor for the protection of personal data.' To this end, the working group shall adopt a cooperation agenda 'that defines priority aspects for accomplishing that purpose, especially regarding the respective homologation processes of data protection systems.' 248 Overall, with regard to data protection, we see how privacy and data protection have become a trade topic and how PTAs strive to interface domestic regulatory regimes, which can be quite diverging across jurisdictions. We can also observe the role of the EU and the US as major actors pushing for the adoption of certain regulatory standards or templates, as well as their repositioning over time-with the EU agreeing on the inclusion of data flows language and the US subscribing to certain international standards and principles of data collection and processing.Earlier agreements dealing with privacy issues consist of side non-binding declarations of mere programmatic nature.

        <p>In the past two decades, countries have increasingly included digital trade provisions in their PTAs. The newly emerged framework of digital trade governance is however fragmented, patchy, and complex. Even on relatively simple issues, such as the customs duty moratorium on electronic transmissions or electronic authentication, there is a great variety of rules and formulations, possibly with differing legal effects. We could also observe that despite these variations, there are important levels of regulatory convergence on certain objectives and principles (like the facilitation of e-commerce, reduction of unnecessary barriers, and considering the needs of SMEs), as well as on distinct topics, such as transparency, paperless trading, and electronic authentication. Yet, significant differences remain, in particular with regard to the treatment of crossborder data flows, data localization, and personal data protection.In the past two decades, countries have increasingly included digital trade provisions in their PTAs.

        <p>As the importance of the data-driven economy grows, moving forward with an apt legal design becomes critical. Policy-makers are now well aware of this and we see it reflected both in the reinvigorated efforts under the umbrella of the WTO to reach an agreement on electronic commerce, as well as in new bolder deals that go beyond existing commitments and look at a range of emerging issues, such as digital identity, artificial intelligence, electronic invoicing, and open data. 249 In any of these efforts, it is essential that there are comprehensive data and analyses of all the relevant norms. We hope that our TAPED dataset, bits of which this article presented, can be an important step in providing such information. We also trust that the dataset can be useful for researchers in different areas, such as law, economics, or political science, as well as for governments, international, and non-governmental organization officials, who may use it as a tool for evidence-based policy-making but also for normative analyses of how things should be, so as to ensure that data innovation is fostered but at the same time certain fundamental values, such as national security and privacy protection, are adequately safeguarded.As the importance of the data-driven economy grows, moving forward with an apt legal design becomes critical.
