        <p>As SARS-COV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) ravages the globe, heads of state are making swift decisions to put large swathes of the world's population under mass isolation in the race to heed off Covid-19's lethality, particularly in certain population subgroups. How are these decisions-that affect each and every one of us, some groups disproportionately and regardless of Covid-19 status-made? How far have policy makers and politicians consulted those who have experience and expertise on the secondary effects of lockdowns, social isolation measures and movement restrictions?As SARS-COV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) ravages the globe, heads of state are making swift decisions to put large swathes of the world's population under mass isolation in the race to heed off Covid-19's lethality, particularly in certain population subgroups.

        <p>We attempted to address these questions with a rapid analysis of 24 countries' Covid-19 task force compositions. The countries were selected to represent a range of geographies and income levels. As far as possible, we focused on governance bodies set up or activated to give scientific, or evidence-based, advice to national decision makers. In some countries, the advisory and decision-making bodies were one and the same, often taking the form of government-only interministerial committees. We excluded committees which were established to focus on a specific area, for example, research related to vaccination; rather, we examined committees whose explicit mandate (based on available information) was to provide advisory guidance on the overall national response.We attempted to address these questions with a rapid analysis of 24 countries' Covid-19 task force compositions.

        <p>We scanned publicly available documentation from government websites, media articles, and in specific cases, contacted our networks in governments and health ministries for official documentation. We then researched the task force members' backgrounds and triangulated from different sources to classify them based on their current professional role or area of specialisation. Experts were thus categorised based on the principal reason for their appointment to the task force. For example, a physician with a current public health role would be classified as a public health specialist and not a clinician, the assumption being that their current role is most relevant for the task force. The 'government' or 'Ministry of Health' category was allocated to career civil servants, that is, posts which are usually filled by generalists rather than specialists. Most other task force members, including public health institute staff, were categorised according to their expertise since the rationale for their task force membership is their specific skill set BMJ Global Health (mathematical modeller, virologist, etc) rather than their institutional affiliation.We scanned publicly available documentation from government websites, media articles, and in specific cases, contacted our networks in governments and health ministries for official documentation.

        <p>We highlight a number of key issues, some very worrying, made evident by table 1: 1.'evidence' seems to be largely understood to mean research-based evidence, and not necessarily experiential, implementation-based evidence from the field The vast majority of Covid-19 response task force members are from reputed universities and government institutes where rigorous research is conducted in the classical sense, often under clinical trial or laboratory conditions. Information and evidence on the lived experiences and everyday challenges faced by the various groups in society who are (at times, severely) affected by isolation measures seem to be altogether overlooked in the urgency of the current situation.We highlight a number of key issues, some very worrying, made evident by table 1: 1.'evidence' seems to be largely understood to mean research-based evidence, and not necessarily experiential, implementation-based evidence from the field The vast majority of Covid-19 response task force members are from reputed universities and government institutes where rigorous research is conducted in the classical sense, often under clinical trial or laboratory conditions.

        <p>A multiministry task force at least theoretically brings in concerns from other sectors such as education, 4 economy, interior, and so on, potentially raising serious issues in terms of, for example, child development 5 (relevant to decisions on school closures, for example), 6 loss of livelihoods 7 (particularly relevant in low-income countries 8 and those with large social inequalities and no social safety net), and further marginalisation of migrants 9 and illegal workers (who often have nowhere to isolate to). However, how far those concerns are actually taken into consideration is impossible to discern without more transparency with regard to the content of deliberations and potential consultations with external parties.A multiministry task force at least theoretically brings in concerns from other sectors such as education, 4 economy, interior, and so on, potentially raising serious issues in terms of, for example, child development 5 (relevant to decisions on school closures, for example), 6 loss of livelihoods 7 (particularly relevant in low-income countries 8 and those with large social inequalities and no social safety net), and further marginalisation of migrants 9 and illegal workers (who often have nowhere to isolate to).

        <p>Vulnerable groups 11 such as the disabled, 12 those with serious mental health conditions, 13 single mothers, 14 people in abusive family relationships 15 and the elderly 16 bear the burden of the negative consequences of isolation and loneliness, potentially threatening the social fabric of society. Civil society organisations, community groups, social workers, nurse-caregivers and many other groups are at the front lines with this broad cross-section of society clearly affected by the far-reaching effects of mass isolation. Civil society can also raise awareness on existing social inequalities which are usually exacerbated in crisis situations, leaving many to feel that 'self-isolation is a privilege for the rich'.

        <p>We acknowledge that the information may not be complete, nor completely up to date, given the extremely fast-paced dynamic of the Covid-19 outbreak as well as response measures. We also recognise that Covid-19 task force compositions are not the sole indication of whose voices are included in decision-making. Through the fairly broad range of (mostly) publicly available information analysed, we attempted to understand which groups the task forces were reaching out to within the scope of a rapid analysis. In general, protocols, reports, minutes of task force meetings and lists of externally consulted parties were simply not easily available. Nevertheless, we feel that the broad conclusions we take based on our rapid (but imperfect) analysis still hold based on the information we were able to access. The table above displays the list of countries and their available task force information.We acknowledge that the information may not be complete, nor completely up to date, given the extremely fast-paced dynamic of the Covid-19 outbreak as well as response measures.

        <p>Governments must recognise the multidimensional effects and needs of society 26 during this Covid-19 crisis and consult more broadly and across disciplines, within health and beyond health, based on a true multisectoral paradigm. More importantly, more transparency is needed regarding who decision-making bodies are listening to as a basis for their decisions. Now more than ever, the voices of those who are at risk of getting left behind need to be heard. 27 In the end, we must ensure that we do not do more harm than good with the measures in place to protect our at-risk populations.Governments must recognise the multidimensional effects and needs of society 26 during this Covid-19 crisis and consult more broadly and across disciplines, within health and beyond health, based on a true multisectoral paradigm.
