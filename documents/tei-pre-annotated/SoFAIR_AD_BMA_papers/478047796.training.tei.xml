        <p>Facing one of the most challenging pandemics for organizational modus operandi , organizations are struggling for operational and strategic support. The adoption of remote work (RW) is increasing. For economic reasons, competitive advantage, or even as a pandemic response (business continuity plan), RW is a domain worth further investigation. However, the literature lacks insight regarding RW adoption. A design science research methodology was adopted, including a systematic literature review to elicit RW advantages, disadvantages, challenges and driving forces, as well as their relation. To evaluate and demonstrate findings, 129 qualitative interviews were performed with RW professionals. In the end, 57 decision factors were elicited, and 16 relations were validated. The authors concluded that cost-reduction and flexibility to promote work-life balance is the most positive outputs, while communication and technical problems, as well as management issues, are what most concerns professionals. Moreover, positive relations are more recognized among professionals over negative ones.Facing one of the most challenging pandemics for organizational modus operandi , organizations are struggling for operational and strategic support.

        <p>Organizations are in continuous evolution [1] and hire people en masse every day and everywhere in a constant search for the best workforce for necessary jobs [2]. Due to globalization, distributed work and distributed teams are unavoidable [3]. The literature points out that due to higher rates of employment compared to that of recruitment [4], big organizations struggle to allocate all their employees in physical spaces [5].Organizations are in continuous evolution [1] and hire people en masse every day and everywhere in a constant search for the best workforce for necessary jobs [2].

        <p>Previous research indicates the possibility of having to downsize and cut costs in order to increase flexibility and create customer-oriented solutions [6] with the goal of staying ahead of the competition. Others highlight the proposition of reducing costs for increasing economical outcomes with the aim of keeping a positive economic balance [7] or just plain and simple challenges in finding financial savings solutions [8]. To summarize, with globalization, organizational growth brings challenges such as not having enough seats for employees in physical office space.Previous research indicates the possibility of having to downsize and cut costs in order to increase flexibility and create customer-oriented solutions [6] with the goal of staying ahead of the competition.

To summarize, with globalization, organizational growth brings challenges such as not having enough seats for employees in physical office space.</p>
        <p>In order to fight these challenges and become more competitive, organizations strive to find new ways of becoming more flexible [9], more rentable [10,11] and more financially profitable [12,13]. Technology has been pointed at as a pivotal enabler [14] to support massive virtual collaboration [15] that has demonstrated potential for both advancing sciences and to turn the drawbacks of virtuality into strategic advantages while also supporting rigorous scientific outcomes [16]. Therefore, organizations have begun to search for new paradigms and solutions such as remote work (RW) [17], which allows them to be geographically free [18]. Driving forces such as globalization [3], the informatization of industries [14], or government legislative support [19] have also stimulated RW adoption.In order to fight these challenges and become more competitive, organizations strive to find new ways of becoming more flexible [9], more rentable [10,11] and more financially profitable [12,13].

        <p>Moreover, based on the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic, at this time, nearly every organization must rely on remote teams to sustain business activity [20]; it is estimated that almost 60% of people are presently in RW due to the coronavirus [21,22].Moreover, based on the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic, at this time, nearly every organization must rely on remote teams to sustain business activity [20]; it is estimated that almost 60% of people are presently in RW due to the coronavirus [21,22].</p>
        <p>Prior literature points out that RW could shape organizations' daily work and contribute to defining the modern workplace [23]. However, more recent studies [24,25] point to RW as a complex domain, in exponential evolution, and one in which it is important to synthesize its decision factors to assist decision-makers before RW adoption.Prior literature points out that RW could shape organizations' daily work and contribute to defining the modern workplace [23].

        <p>As such, this investigation aims to explore, synthesize and elicit the following RW concept key aspects: advantages, driving forces; challenges; and disadvantages. To pursue our goal, the following research questions (RQ) were designed: RQ1: What are the advantages, disadvantages, driving forces and challenges of RW adoption? RQ2: How do the RW decision factors influence each other positively and negatively? RQ2 aims to explore the correlation between advantages/disadvantages/driving forces/challenges.As such, this investigation aims to explore, synthesize and elicit the following RW concept key aspects: advantages, driving forces; challenges; and disadvantages.

        <p>Several studies exist in literature regarding RW from a variety of qualitative [12], quantitative [6] or mixed [19] investigations. Most tend to research and report findings on a single vector of analysis. For instance, advantages, disadvantages, driving forces, challenges, solutions, ethical issues, strategies, or best practices. However, none attempted to either investigate how vectors relate or influence each other nor to synthesize previous findings on a single vector. This is demonstrated in Table 1. These findings strengthen our research goal.Several studies exist in literature regarding RW from a variety of qualitative [12], quantitative [6] or mixed [19] investigations.

        <p>This study reports challenges and disadvantages for different RW types. It concludes that a higher level of work virtuality leads to a lower level of work satisfaction, mainly due to inappropriate management techniques and problems related to information and technology-mediated communication. The results also suggest that work satisfaction of higher and medium-level virtuality workers could be increased by appropriate ICT, by compensating the related costs, via improved organization of work processes and through greater time/place flexibility.This study reports challenges and disadvantages for different RW types.

        <p>We studied how the positive concepts (advantages and driving forces) relate to negative concepts (disadvantages and challenges). Our findings are modeled in Figure 3. Some of the listed advantages can only be achieved if some disadvantages/challenges are mitigated. For instance, a worker who feels isolated (D1) or with a lack of balance between professional and family life (D2) will not be able to increase its productivity (A1) and feel greater fulfillment with its job (A4) [12]. Plus, it will be hard to enhance teamwork performance (A8) while avoiding communication issues (D6 and C1) [31]. On the other hand, positive driving forces may incentivize RW implementation. However, this will probably be ineffective without serious consideration of associated challenges. For instance, technical competence (DF6) and a flexibility mindset (DF5) are useful, but they will not help if technological challenges (C4) [32] or infrastructure problems (D9) emerge.We studied how the positive concepts (advantages and driving forces) relate to negative concepts (disadvantages and challenges).

        <p>Since it is easier for remote workers to disengage from work (A12), it might lead to a lack of attendance (C14) [66]; for example, a worker can miss certain meetings if he does not see people "getting up " to go to the meeting room or if he falls asleep due to being alone "at work ". We consider this human nature, but when one is at the office, these types of problems would hardly happen. Additionally, said situations could lead to another disadvantage for the worker, such as issues in the Balance of work, family and personal life (D2) [19]. The problem of falling asleep is normally due to the fact of a person not sleeping well, which is clearly a personal problem interacting with the worker's job.Since it is easier for remote workers to disengage from work (A12), it might lead to a lack of attendance (C14) [66]; for example, a worker can miss certain meetings if he does not see people "getting up " to go to the meeting room or if he falls asleep due to being alone "at work ".

        <p>A virtualization environment (C1) forces organizations to equip workers with the necessary communication tools. This increases technological dependencies (D5) [18].

        <p>Since it is easier for remote workers to disengage from work (A12), it might lead to a lack of attendance (C14) [66]; for example, a worker can miss certain meetings if he does not see people "getting up " to go to the meeting room or if he falls asleep due to being alone "at work ". We consider this human nature, but when one is at the office, these types of problems would hardly happen. Additionally, said situations could lead to another disadvantage for the worker, such as issues in the Balance of work, family and personal life (D2) [19]. The problem of falling asleep is normally due to the fact of a person not sleeping well, which is clearly a personal problem interacting with the worker's job.Since it is easier for remote workers to disengage from work (A12), it might lead to a lack of attendance (C14) [66]; for example, a worker can miss certain meetings if he does not see people "getting up " to go to the meeting room or if he falls asleep due to being alone "at work ".

        <p>Promoting availability (A9) and remote expertise (A7) may lead to an increase in productivity (A1) while avoiding geographic location (A10) [18] issues. However, all this may crumble if companies and workers do not resist management problems (C2).Promoting availability (A9) and remote expertise (A7) may lead to an increase in productivity (A1) while avoiding geographic location (A10) [18] issues.

        <p>By using different backchannels, workers may face challenges in balancing between formal and informal communication and documentation (C13), which may lead to Communication problems (D6) [69]. On the other hand, this can also stimulate interaction with people from different backgrounds, which leads to more learning opportunities (A11).By using different backchannels, workers may face challenges in balancing between formal and informal communication and documentation (C13), which may lead to Communication problems (D6) [69].

        <p>A virtualization environment (C1) forces organizations to equip workers with the necessary communication tools. This increases technological dependencies (D5) [18].

        <p>When improperly handled, management challenges (C2) may reduce professional and social interaction between the employees (D1) or between management (D10), which reduces workers' rights and connections to the organization (D11) and perturbs the balance between work and life (D2) [32].When improperly handled, management challenges (C2) may reduce professional and social interaction between the employees (D1) or between management (D10), which reduces workers' rights and connections to the organization (D11) and perturbs the balance between work and life (D2) [32].</p>
        <p>Organizational and individual commitment (DF3), as well as competence (DF6), revealed that remote workers have fewer role-coordination problems (D10) [64] and can exhibit both higher job satisfaction (A4) and even greater commitment to the organization (A1) [19].Organizational and individual commitment (DF3), as well as competence (DF6), revealed that remote workers have fewer role-coordination problems (D10) [64] and can exhibit both higher job satisfaction (A4) and even greater commitment to the organization (A1) [19].</p>
        <p>When receiving less career support than Non-remote workers (C2) and feel an impersonal environment at an organization (C7) [32], employees may experience more workfamily conflicts (D2), influencing their turnover intentions, role stressors and job satisfaction (A4) [29].When receiving less career support than Non-remote workers (C2) and feel an impersonal environment at an organization (C7) [32], employees may experience more workfamily conflicts (D2), influencing their turnover intentions, role stressors and job satisfaction (A4) [29].</p>
        <p>It is critical for remote workers to be available to learn new competencies (DF6) and embrace flexibility (DF5) since the constant "moving around" increases the number of new people they meet (A11), leads to more learning opportunities, and increases the requirement for new social skills, bringing greater flexibility (A3) [72]. If remote workers do not use ICT effectively (C8), all the above-mentioned advantages will not be experienced [51].It is critical for remote workers to be available to learn new competencies (DF6) and embrace flexibility (DF5) since the constant "moving around" increases the number of new people they meet (A11), leads to more learning opportunities, and increases the requirement for new social skills, bringing greater flexibility (A3) [72].

        <p>Those who focus on the quality of teamwork (C5) while maintaining team cohesion make an important impact not only on performance (A8) but also on job satisfaction (A4) in remote teams [51].

        <p>Yet, mobile technologies (DF1) can have a positive impact on workers by increasing their independence (A6) [6] and flexibility (A3) [30] as well as potentiating more real-time information about their jobs (A9). However, on the other hand, it may negatively impact their work quality and relationships with others, given that workers need to adapt to new technologies and features to be learned. If these new skills are not acquired by remote workers, they can experience conflict and coordination problems (D10) due to misusage of the technology.Yet, mobile technologies (DF1) can have a positive impact on workers by increasing their independence (A6) [6] and flexibility (A3) [30] as well as potentiating more real-time information about their jobs (A9).

        <p>Therefore, workers who are not willing to change or are skeptical in terms of doing RW will ultimately lead to constraints and performance breaks (C11). Other challenges and possible disadvantages can also be catalyzed. For instance, RW employees can have problems of misunderstandings of judgment (D11) due to the virtual nature of communications, either from the voice tone or due to the signal cuts during teleconferences. If the worker is already against RW, then this type of situation can lead to the rupture of relationships between employees and even the relation between the worker and the organization itself [30].Therefore, workers who are not willing to change or are skeptical in terms of doing RW will ultimately lead to constraints and performance breaks (C11).

        <p>Willing to cut costs (DF8) by reducing the number of fixed office places, organizations can better manage mobility and critical business interdependencies (DF7) since their workforce is globally distributed. This may increase both worker interaction with strangers, different places to work (A11) [5] and time for reflection (A15). By being remote workers, employee self-regulation and control may increase as a result of the enhancement in their own autonomy (A6), always having to manage their own pace, which ultimately brings productivity (A1) and happiness (A4) when they onboard for more flexibility from the beginning (DF5) [46].Willing to cut costs (DF8) by reducing the number of fixed office places, organizations can better manage mobility and critical business interdependencies (DF7) since their workforce is globally distributed.

        <p>The literature points that the influence of RW flexibility (DF5) for both the organization and the workers can be positive, more flexible (A3) [10] for the organization, and negative in terms of Balance of work, family and personal life problems (D2) for the employee [82].The literature points that the influence of RW flexibility (DF5) for both the organization and the workers can be positive, more flexible (A3) [10] for the organization, and negative in terms of Balance of work, family and personal life problems (D2) for the employee [82].</p>

        <p>To demonstrate the proposed artifacts (Tables 4-7 and Figure 4), 129 qualitative interviews were performed with RW professionals. The first set of interviews was held to elicit more knowledge on the RW decision factors with real-life worker perceptions and to validate advantages, disadvantages, driving forces and challenges (RQ1). The second set had the objective of validating, according to real-life experience, how each RW decision factor influences the other (RQ2).To demonstrate the proposed artifacts (Tables 4-7 and Figure 4), 129 qualitative interviews were performed with RW professionals.

        <p>Interviews are the most well-known method to collect data in qualitative research and can be used in all kinds of philosophy paradigms, whether positivist, interpretive or critical [90]. According to Myers [90], the interview allows gathering valuable data from people in different roles and situations. Thus, interviews can be an appropriate method to develop and evaluate an artifact. Moreover, interviews can be used to demonstrate the applicability and validity of an artifact in practice [91]. To turn the interviews more efficiently, the questionnaires were designed according to Myers' recommendations.Interviews are the most well-known method to collect data in qualitative research and can be used in all kinds of philosophy paradigms, whether positivist, interpretive or critical [90].

        <p>Regarding the number of interviews necessary in qualitative research, Myers [90] argues that there is no specific number. It depends on the research question. We followed the recommendations by [92], who argues that twenty interviews are a significant amount for this type of research. Even if it is a convenient sampling, a mix of different participants according to gender, type of organization, culture, role, education was selected to reduce contextual bias [93].

        <p>The authors chose to analyze the factors that were below the red line, to provide further insights on the topics that were against the literature. According to interviewees, for C8, it is indifferent where a person is working as this challenge happens both in RW but also in the office. It always depends on the scope of the organization; for some types of work, law firms, for example, RW, is not a good fit. It also depends on the employees' generation, as newer generations tend to be more IT-friendly.The authors chose to analyze the factors that were below the red line, to provide further insights on the topics that were against the literature.

        <p>When asking the interviewees why they did not validate C13, the most common answers were that they only use official channels; some stated that these mixtures already happen in the office where at any point in time informal communications are made; some even said that the use of official channels might be awkward in the beginning, taking time people to get used to them. If these exchanges are well defined by the organization and depending on its culture, then it will not be a problem.When asking the interviewees why they did not validate C13, the most common answers were that they only use official channels; some stated that these mixtures already happen in the office where at any point in time informal communications are made; some even said that the use of official channels might be awkward in the beginning, taking time people to get used to them.

        <p>For C14, the interviewees showed that attendance actually became better with RW because overall most people increased in their availability. Employees also tend to have more respect for the time slots and frames defined in order to not waste their own and their colleagues' time. There is an understanding that RW does not stop being work only because one is not at the office; naturally, it depends on the character of the employee to have the proper responsibility to not miss appointments.For C14, the interviewees showed that attendance actually became better with RW because overall most people increased in their availability.

        <p>In line with the interviews, D4 was not validated because, according to the interviewees, this disadvantage will depend on workers' own emotional management. For most employees, the stress levels did not grow in RW: actually, they did not even feel more than the in-office usual, with some even feeling less stress as a result of the reduction in lost time and patience that occurs during work commutes (the only occasion where this could happen would be in a pandemic-like state).In line with the interviews, D4 was not validated because, according to the interviewees, this disadvantage will depend on workers' own emotional management.

        <p>D7 is seen to depend on the personality and personal management of the worker. According to the interviews, time management is or should be the same as in the office, with some interviewees going as far as saying that it was the opposite; that it could be considered as an advantage given that everyone can manage their time at their own pace.D7 is seen to depend on the personality and personal management of the worker.

        <p>A similar impression was observed in D13 because, according to interviews, this is something that also happens in the office if there are constraints and ill intentions from colleagues.

        <p>The last disadvantage D13 can actually be considered an advantage to workers because they have fewer distractions in RW.

        <p>When talking about A8, the interviewees said that we should have improvements at a personal and individual level. However, it can also lead to communication problems. According to most of the sample, it is not an advantage and can even be considered a disadvantage because now they end up wasting more time.When talking about A8, the interviewees said that we should have improvements at a personal and individual level.

        <p>Finally, we have A12, which according to interviews, is more difficult to achieve. In RW, workers are more available than they would be in the office. Having to set up their workstations in their living rooms, being close to the computer, anytime they receive a notification, it is checked regardless of the hour of the day. This may lead to problems in disentangling personal life from working life. Ultimately, there are workers who have bigger disengaging capacities and some who need to commute in order to completely turn off from work.Finally, we have A12, which according to interviews, is more difficult to achieve.

        <p>To provide a complete view of all findings, we decided to cross the information collected from literature with the information collected from interviews. In Table 8, one can see the top five selections in literature and interviewees.

        <p>After the author compiled the data in Table 8, we can see that there is only one common advantage, besides work-life balance, between the ones found in literature and those reported by interviewees: cost reduction. The reasons pointed by interviewees are on "physical spaces (offices, hubs, etc.)"; workers "spend less money on their commute to work"; and according to some interviewees, "also on their food" expense. For interviewees, the best advantage of RW is the work-life balance. It allows them to better "plan their own time", and it makes it possible to "balance their personal and professional life". For instance, aspects such as a doctor's appointment, receiving parcels at home, or assisting older relatives, become much easier to execute in an RW environment. Some workers have also reported that the opportunity to watch their kids growing up "without neglecting your work" is the greatest advantage. Improved time management was also pointed at as a benefit. Workers exhibit many differences and have their preferences (e.g., some prefer to work in the morning, others at late hours). This may affect worker performance. In an interviewee's words: "Since we are responsible for our own work and the way we use our time, then we can choose the best way to work and the best way to achieve the best results".After the author compiled the data in Table 8, we can see that there is only one common advantage, besides work-life balance, between the ones found in literature and those reported by interviewees: cost reduction.

        <p>While for advantages professionals and the literature agree in 3 of the top 5 (work-life balance, cost-reduction and productivity), with regards to disadvantages, there are only two commonalities. These are the lack of interaction and the balance of work, family, and personal life, which can clearly be a big part of the distractions affecting worker performance at home.While for advantages professionals and the literature agree in 3 of the top 5 (work-life balance, cost-reduction and productivity), with regards to disadvantages, there are only two commonalities.

        <p>Professionals also pointed to "communication" as an important issue. In our viewpoint, it is normal that this disadvantage pops up from professionals instead of the literature since the former experience it firsthand in practice. This is very interesting to note since we are living in the digital era where the evolution of available collaborative tools is supposedly advanced to the point where we should not have any kind of communicational problems. This can happen due to several reasons as the "lack of experience with the tools", "network and connectivity issues that can freeze webcams," and the possibility of "cuts in the audio", leading to misunderstandings or, in the worst-case scenario, to no communication at all.Professionals also pointed to "communication" as an important issue.

        <p>Regarding (DF1-D10), participants did not reach a consensus on whether technology helps tasks and people organization. The explanation may be on how managers use technology and which technology is chosen. There are several technologies presently available for this purpose. If people are willing to change, and if managers are aware of the best technologies, this should not be an issue. About (DF1-D11), interviewees pointed out that technology may affect the quality of communication and, therefore, may promote harsher judgments of others. It is important for managers to oversee the inclusion of new members and sustain a team spirit. Some interviewees also argue that certain soft skills become even more important depending on the channel being used (written, spoken), given that communication is made in a virtual way. Consequently, there is room for misunderstandings to arise due to, for example, voice tones being perceived in a negative way or even the way people address each other. What used to be easy to understand by looking at the speakers' body language becomes swayed by the own opinion of the person on the receiving end.Regarding (DF1-D10), participants did not reach a consensus on whether technology helps tasks and people organization.

        <p>Regarding (DF3-D10), most interviewees reported having experienced fewer conflicts than in the office, while others argued that it depends on the workers themselves. Reasons for this are based on worker mentality. Full RW is not a vacation, so it requires a sharp sense of responsibility and organization.Regarding (DF3-D10), most interviewees reported having experienced fewer conflicts than in the office, while others argued that it depends on the workers themselves.

        <p>Looking at (DF6-D2), interviewees have mixed feelings. Collected information indicates that if there are focus and competence, one ends up doing it faster, while otherwise, it may promote a negative outcome. It was also reported that more than technical skills, the worker mindset is the central issue. While some argue that it is difficult to control external (family) factors, others argue that it is critical to have and to define a specific space where one can be, somehow, isolated.Looking at (DF6-D2), interviewees have mixed feelings.

        <p>On (DF6-D10), some interviewees argued that since people are not face-to-face, problems may always happen regardless of commitment. Others said that commitment is critical to overcoming such problems. Plus, if all workers commit, conflicts and problems of coordination will decrease. Organizations may not only assure home conditions but also on how to manage workers remotely. For instance, the inclusion of junior trainees would require different approaches.On (DF6-D10), some interviewees argued that since people are not face-to-face, problems may always happen regardless of commitment.

        <p>Regarding (DF8 + A11), some participants emphasized that they did not see any negative effect between the two and that economic benefits do not affect learning opportunities. However, others argued that premiums are critical to offering compensation when expenses comparably increase against those expected with life in the office. For some participants, this is an opportunity for companies to reward their employees in an economical way. Considering that the employee enables himself to work from another country or in another time zone, then the company should give him more money at the end of the month (a common practice nowadays in big consulting businesses).Regarding (DF8 + A11), some participants emphasized that they did not see any negative effect between the two and that economic benefits do not affect learning opportunities.

        <p>Looking at (C1-D14), opinions differ. Although we are in RW, technologies help monitor more than usual. Management can see updates on servers and the interactions in groups; this is a type of reduced monitoring, but it exists. The relation also must do with management failures because if one needs to talk to A or B, one schedule with A and B a time slot for it. The problem of not being able to reach someone gets resolved this way, using technologies for such purposes, like Microsoft Teams and Outlook. Other participants even go further and say that if someone has these challenges because the boss is bad, then they would need to apply more strict monitoring and training in management topics. For some interviewees, this is a neutral topic, depending on how things are managed, but in general, a positive one; things may not be what they seem, as a person could have just missed an update. However, on the negative side, there are present-day applications used by some employees that automate mouse movements, preventing a persons' status from going to away mode. About (C2-D2), people with no children or living alone argued that this usually would never be an issue but understand such a possibility in different contexts. Hence, arguments were made that this is all about different management styles from both managers and general workers. In terms of upper management, this has a negative impact since when working remotely, it is more difficult to have access to people and understand their specific situations. Regarding workers, it is very difficult to preview all possible family contexts, hence this being a huge challenge to manage. In contrast, those who can properly manage work and family can benefit from remote working.Looking at (C1-D14), opinions differ. Although we are in RW, technologies help monitor more than usual.

        <p>Regarding (C5-A8), some reported that keeping team cohesion is challenging given the distance and isolation beyond daily meetings. On the other hand, others reported that the RW has a positive impact on team cohesion and performance; in a particular case, there is a mature team that reported a considerable increase in both variables.Regarding (C5-A8), some reported that keeping team cohesion is challenging given the distance and isolation beyond daily meetings.

        <p>Last, but not least, (C8-A11). Here, interviewees argued that proper knowledge of existing communication channels leads to new opportunities to interact with more people. This may be an advantage and contribute to personal fulfillment. However, some argued that the lack of knowledge on how to use such channels makes this interaction more difficult and time-consuming to explain. Therefore, teaching people how to use these tools is critical.Last, but not least, (C8-A11).

        <p>Ultimately, four relations (DF1 + A3)(DF5 + A3)(DF7 + A4)(DF9 + A2) are validated by both literature and professionals. To tune our model, we have used a threshold to define the relationship as valid. The relations with results above or equal to 75% were confirmed; those between 70 and 30% require more research, and those below 30% rejected. The relations were narrowed down from 30 to 16 (Figure 5).Ultimately, four relations (DF1 + A3)(DF5 + A3)(DF7 + A4)(DF9 + A2) are validated by both literature and professionals.

        <p>Only one out of the 16 confirmed relations is a negative one. All the others are positive. These results may hint at the overall opinion that RW, at the moment, tends to be perceived as a more positive than negative practice.Only one out of the 16 confirmed relations is a negative one.

        <p>Facing one of the most impacting pandemics (COVID-19) in organization modus operandi, this research aimed to enrich the theoretical and practical understanding of RW advantages, disadvantages, driving forces and challenges, as well as how they relate to each other. An SLR was performed to elicit the main RW decision factors and how they relate. Then, 129 interviews were performed with RW practitioners. The former 109 interviewees helped to narrow down the true decision factors experienced in the real world, while the other 20 interviews helped to tune how the decision factors influence each other.Facing one of the most impacting pandemics (COVID-19) in organization modus operandi, this research aimed to enrich the theoretical and practical understanding of RW advantages, disadvantages, driving forces and challenges, as well as how they relate to each other.

        <p>When compared with prior literature, this investigation is pioneering in relating different decision factors. It enables organizations to be more aware of what to expect and how to prepare for RW. Furthermore, while current literature mostly focuses on adding new insights about each decision factor, this investigation synthesizes the main literature findings.When compared with prior literature, this investigation is pioneering in relating different decision factors.

        <p>Organizations may ensure that workers have the right technology (organizational or personally owned) before adopting RW. Those who aim to increase their internal flexibility or worker mobility may look to RW as an interesting solution. Likewise, RW is a proper strategy for organizations aiming to reduce costs, as it will allow them to hire in cheaper geographies while employees save travel expenses. Finally, RW is also seen as a great way for workers to better organize their day to accomplish both work and personal affairs, which may increase worker motivation and productivity.Organizations may ensure that workers have the right technology (organizational or personally owned) before adopting RW.

        <p>Nonetheless, RW also presents some management concerns. Organizations may struggle to control technology issues as often times part of what is used is not under their control (workers' home infrastructure). This may lead to communicational issues, which may occur as a result of poor communication quality or an absence of visual contact that would allow the reading of body language. Managers also struggle to identify and tackle various types of problems as RW is not suitable for every worker; it is up to management to define and oversee the RW capabilities and performance of each worker, possibly considering a hybrid model. Additionally, given a reduction in contact, team cohesion is harder to maintain in RW. Finally, since companies do not control workers' Internet providers or electricity infrastructure, there are risks that can compromise internal projects.Nonetheless, RW also presents some management concerns.

        <p>Overall, our findings point that RW promotes much more positive relations rather than negative ones. Technology has a positive influence on the work-life balance, bringing greater mobility for workers to carry out their activities whenever and wherever they need to. Likewise, flexibility also has a positive influence on the work-life balance, enabling workers to manage their own schedule more efficiently, which in turn has a positive influence on job satisfaction. Convincing workers and creating an organizational culture of RW advantages avoid resistance and increases both productivity and morale. Overall, an organizational vision focused on adding value may promote cost reduction as a result of RW adoption.Overall, our findings point that RW promotes much more positive relations rather than negative ones.

        <p>to invest in ways to increase control over the technology that will be used when adopting RW. This should be done considering workers' infrastructure and facilities issues; • to implement practices to promote team cohesion. For example, always keeping the video on, having regular meetings, among others; • to apply team management strategies to control team health and productivity; • to create an RW culture and sensitize workers for RW adoption; • to investigate the most suitable tools and methodologies to use for each organizational context; • to reinforce measurement tools that verify how well workers can manage and integrate their personal and work-life.to invest in ways to increase control over the technology that will be used when adopting RW.

        <p>Although we can find older research documents, they may not be completely up to date. This is prone to happen due to the tremendously high pace of technological development. Moreover, the involvement of more RW practitioners would have increased the validity of the results.Although we can find older research documents, they may not be completely up to date.

        <p>Further research should be carried out on the decision factors and relations where some doubt remained. Other contingency factors (industry, culture, size, etc.), as advised by [94], must be further investigated since they may influence the results obtained in this study.Further research should be carried out on the decision factors and relations where some doubt remained.

        <p>Additionally, this exact same study could be conducted in a non-pandemic context as the one lived during the year 2020 (COVID-19). As some workers are doing RW by force, not by choice, this may have influenced some answers.Additionally, this exact same study could be conducted in a non-pandemic context as the one lived during the year 2020 (COVID-19).

        <p>Moreover, the authors advise further investigation on management and governance practices for RW (i.e., remote project management), preferably considering agile methodologies like SCRUM [95]. Plus, another research path may rely on the exploration of the usefulness of RW in small and medium enterprises and which competitive advantage it may bring to them. Finally, it could be very interesting to further explore and understand which types of jobs/roles and organizational cultures would better suit the RW model.Moreover, the authors advise further investigation on management and governance practices for RW (i.e., remote project management), preferably considering agile methodologies like SCRUM [95].
