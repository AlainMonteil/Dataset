        <p>We study corporate control tracing controlling shareholders for thousands of listed firms from 127 countries over 2004-2012. Government and family control is pervasive in civil-law countries. Blocks are commonplace, but less so in common-law countries. These patterns apply to large, medium, and small firms. In contrast, the development -control nexus is heterogeneous; strong for large but absent for small firms. Control correlates strongly with shareholder protection, the stringency of employment contracts and unions power. Conversely, the correlations with creditor rights, legal formalism, and entry regulation appear weak. These patterns support both legal origin and political theories of financial development.</p>
        <p>Understanding the determinants and consequences of the various types of corporate control is of first-order importance in of corporate finance (La Porta, Lopez-de Silanes, and Shleifer (1999); Tirole (2006)). While most theory distinguishes between widely held corporations with dispersed ownership and firms in which a dominant shareholder exerts control (Shleifer and Vishny (1997)), corporate structures are complex (Laeven and Levine (2008)). For instance, equity blocks can be found in most widely held corporations (Edmans and Holderness (2017)). In addition, pyramids that allow shareholders to influence decisions over their cash-flow rights and cross-holdings of equity in business groups are widespread (Dyck and Zingales (2004)). Ownership and control are often obscured by companies that incorporate in offshore centers (Zucman (2015)). Following the influential contribution of La Porta, Lopez-de Silanes, and Shleifer (1999), a voluminous literature studies ownership concentration and corporate control across countries, with particular emphasis given to the role of investor protection rights and legal origin. To date, however, the literature has yet to reach a consensus even on the basic correlations, as researchers face a number of empirical challenges.

Following the influential contribution of La Porta, Lopez-de Silanes, and Shleifer (1999), a voluminous literature studies ownership concentration and corporate control across countries, with particular emphasis given to the role of investor protection rights and legal origin. To date, however, the literature has yet to reach a consensus even on the basic correlations, as researchers face a number of empirical challenges.</p>
        <p>The first challenge relates to sample size and composition. In particular, because it is hard to identify control from a myriad of complex corporate ownership structures, comparative studies typically work with samples covering large firms in a few countries. La Porta et al. (1999) examine the association between legal origin and control for the 20 largest listed firms in 27 advanced economies. Extending the analysis, Claessens, Djankov, and Lang (2000) study the association between legal origin/institutions and ownership for 2, 980 firms in nine East Asian countries, Faccio and Lang (2002) look across 5, 232 firms in 13 Western European countries and Lins (2003) works with 1, 433 firms in 18 emerging markets. However, even when Holderness (2016a,b) reassesses the La Porta et al. (1999) results merging these data, he only works with approximately 8, 000 firms in 32 countries.</p>
        <p>Heterogeneity is the second main challenge. The size distribution of listed firms is highly skewed.</p>
        <p>In 2012, for instance, the average market capitalization in our sample is 10 times larger than the median. Very large, medium, and small listed firms differ along numerous dimensions (see Gabaix (2009Gabaix ( , 2016))) and control patterns are likely to vary widely (Tirole (2006), Holderness (2016b)).</p>
        <p>Third, researchers face measurement challenges. It is difficult to identify controlling shareholders from a complex network of equity holdings and or to identify control in firms with multiple large shareholders. The patterns may depend, for instance, on the cutoff that researchers use to identify control (e.g. Holderness (2009)). In addition, while many researchers work with databases on cash-flow, looking at voting rights is conceptually more appealing. Prior studies also show that institutional proxies suffer from measurement error (e.g. Glaeser et al. (2004)).</p>
        <p>In this paper, we make progress on each of these fronts. We first provide a comprehensive description of corporate control for a wide sample of countries and listed firms. Relying on numerous sources (e.g., regulatory filings, company reports, government publications), we augment Bureau van Dijk's ORBIS database on corporate ownership to identify ultimate controlling shareholders from the complex structures of corporate holdings. We apply both a simple cutoff approach that identifies as controlled those firms in which a shareholder (state, family, other) has more than 20% of the voting rights and an alternative game-theoretic method based on the Shapley-Shubik (1954) voting power index to construct measures of corporate control for 42, 720 listed firms from 127 countries over the period 2004 to 2012. 1 Given the wide use of equity blocks, we distinguish between three types of firms: widely held corporations, widely held corporations with one or more equity block(s) (defined as voting rights in excess of 5%), and controlled firms with a dominant shareholder. We split controlled firms into state-controlled, family-controlled, and controlled by other listed or private firms. We provide an anatomy of corporate control using these newly compiled data. The descriptive analysis reveals large differences in corporate control around the world, a result that is consistent with earlier studies that work with smaller and less representative samples. We further show that corporate control patterns are persistent, as the 2007 to 2010 financial crisis did not affect them much. Second, we reexamine the "reduced-form" correlation between corporate control (and ownership concentration) and legal origin. The large sample is useful, as most previous studies consider smaller firm samples with limited country coverage. The large sample is also helpful in examining heterogeneity with respect to firm size and age, characteristics that may affect control and in turn be affected by the institutional environment (Franks et al. (2012), Foley and Greenwood (2010)). 2 The cross-country analysis reveals the following results:</p>
        <p>(i) There are large differences in corporate control across legal families. The share of controlled firms is highest among French civil-law countries, followed by German and then Scandinavian civil-law countries. The share of controlled firms is lowest in common-law countries. The 1 The (1954) method is useful for measuring control in firms with multiple large shareholders and in firms with dispersed ownership and blocks. It also allows one to examine the precision of the cutoff-based approach employed in extant literature.</p>
        <p>2 Franks et al. (2012) study corporate control across 4, 654 non financial firms in the UK, France, Germany, and Italy. They find that as firms mature, ownership gets more dispersed in the UK, whereas in Italy, Germany, and France family control is higher for older firms. Foley and Greenwood (2010) document a similar pattern of ownership diffusion in countries with strong investor protection in a sample of 2, 700 firms in 34 countries.</p>
        <p>patterns are similar when we look at ownership concentration. These results, which do not reflect differences in continent, industry, or level of development, support the early results of the literature (e.g. La Porta et al. (1999)) using a considerably broader sample of firms and countries.</p>
        <p>(ii) Equity blocks are common, present in more than 80% of non controlled firms. This pattern applies across all regions. It also holds in both civil-law and common-law countries, although the share of widely held firms with blocks is highest in French civil-law and lowest in commonlaw countries.</p>
        <p>(iii) The significant cross-country correlation between corporate control and legal origin applies for large, medium, and small listed firms, as well as for young and old firms. These results add to the law and finance literature, addressing concerns that the link between investor protection and ownership dispersion reflects size and age (Holderness (2016b)).</p>
        <p>(iv) Dispersed ownership correlates with GDP per capita (p.c.). However, this correlation is not particularly strong. Moreover, it masks sizeable heterogeneity. The negative correlation between income and corporate control is significant only in the sample of above-median-size firms; it is especially strong for large corporations (top 10% of global market cap firms).</p>
        <p>The correlation is zero in the sample of small and medium-sized public companies. This novel finding echoes the results of Hsieh and Klenow (2014), who show that productivity differences between Mexico, India, and the United States (US) are pronounced for (very) large firms and muted for small firms. Hsieh and Klenow (2014) argue that this result reflects the inability of medium-sized firms to expand in emerging markets die to financial frictions.</p>
        <p>Our results are in line with their conjecture. At the same time, our finding suggests that exploring heterogeneity by employing large firm and country samples can yield new insights.</p>
        <p>Third, we examine the correlation between corporate control and institutional characteristics that legal origin theories emphasize in a simple, unified framework, 3 employing multiple proxies for institutional quality to account for measurement error. While the cross-country associations are not well suited to advance causality. they shed light on the characteristics of the institutional environment that relate to corporate structure. The analysis reveals that:</p>
        <p>(v) Shareholder protection rights, namely, corporate law provisions allowing shareholders to take legal action against managers who abuse their position, are systematically linked to dispersed ownership. This result is consistent with the idea of the law and finance literature that 3 For example, La Porta, Lopez-de Silanes, and Shleifer (1999) focus on investor protection, Djankov et al. (2008b) look at shareholder rights, La Porta, Lopez-de Silanes, and Shleifer (2006) examine securities legislation, and Mueller and Philippon (2011) connect family control to labor market institutions. These (and other) studies examine the role of one (few) institution(s) in different country and firm samples.</p>
        <p>Likewise, researchers have used firm-level data across countries to construct proxies for different aspects of ownership and control, such as private benefits of control (Dyck and Zingales (2004)), the prevalence of business groups (Khanna and Yafeh (2007)), and state ownership of banks (Djankov et al. (2002)). Masulis, Pham, and Zein (2011) construct measures of family-controlled business groups in a larger sample of around 28, 000 firms from 45 countries in 2002 and relate their prevalence to various country and firm characteristics such as pyramid structures and cross-holdings. See also Almeida et al. (2011) for a comprehensive study of Korean business groups (chaebols).</p>
        <p>corporate control substitutes for weak shareholder protection (La Porta et al. (1997), La Porta et al. (1999)).</p>
        <p>(vi) The correlation between control and creditor rights is small and statistically insignificant. This result reaffirms the finding of La Porta, Lopez-de Silanes, and Shleifer (2006) and La Porta, Lopez-de Silanes, and Shleifer (1999) that shareholders' rather than creditors' rights matter for corporate control.</p>
        <p>(vii) Legal formalism, as captured by various measures of the time needed to resolve disputes via courts, is weakly related to corporate control and ownership concentration, a result that challenges Djankov et al. (2008b), who considers a smaller sample.</p>
        <p>(viii) Entry barriers have low correlation with corporate control and ownership concentration.</p>
        <p>(ix) There is a strong correlation between corporate control and labor regulation. In countries with a high percentage of controlled firms, labor legislation imposes restrictions on overtime and firings and union membership and power are relatively high. These results are consistent with political theories of corporate control that emphasize the role of post-Great Depression and World War II welfare-state policies in finance (Roe (2000), Roe (2006), Rajan and Zingales (2003), Rajan and Zingales (2004)). These theories stress the effect that labor laws have on the interaction between controlling shareholders (families and the state), workers, and outside investors. In the Pagano and Volpin (2005) setting, controlling shareholders and corporate insiders collaborate with employers at the expense of minority-outside shareholders in countries with stringent labor legislation.</p>
        <p>In sum, our large sample findings support both legal origin theories of corporate control (e.g., Glaeser and Shleifer (2002), La Porta et al. (1998)) and political theories of corporate control (Roe (2000), Rajan andZingales (2003, 2004), Pagano and Volpin (2005)). In line with the law and finance literature, corporate control is systematically linked to a country's legal origin and the extent of minority shareholders protection. In line with political theories, economic development, as reflected by GDP per capita, is also a strong correlate of control, although only for the (very) large firms that tend to be the most productive. Labor market (welfare state) legislation is also a strong correlate of corporate control, suggesting that linkages between finance and labor markets likely reflect the political equilibrium.</p>
        <p>The paper is organized as follows. In section I, we discuss the data on corporate ownership and we describe both the 20% cutoff and the Shapley-Shubik (1954) method for identifying control.</p>
        <p>Section II presents the main patterns of corporate control around the world. Section III reports results on the associations between corporate control and legal origin. Section IV reports results from the heterogeneity analysis. In Section V, we examine the correlations between control and investor protection, legal formalism, product, and labor market regulations. In section VI, we conclude and discuss directions for future work.foot_0</p>
        <p>In this section, we first discuss the ownership data. We then give an overview of the main types of shareholders. Finally, we discuss the construction of the corporate control proxies.</p>
        <p>Our objective is to construct proxies for corporate control for the largest possible sample of publicly traded firms across the globe. We start with Bureau Van Dijk's (BvD) ORBIS database which includes ownership information, year of incorporation, year of initial public offering and some accounting data for 46, 699 publicly traded firms from 134 countries over the period 2004 to 2012. (While data are available as of the 1990s, coverage is limited prior to 2004). BvD collects ownership data from firms' reports, stock exchange releases, company websites, press news, private correspondence, and agencies that themselves collect information on firm performance and ownership (e.g., ICAP in Greece, InfoCredit in Cyprus, etc.).</p>
        <p>BvD reports voting rights, rather than cash-flow rights, taking into account dual shares, "golden shares", and other special shares types. 5 The BvD databases are therefore suitable for identifying control (see also Massa and Zaldokas (2016), Kalemli-Ozcan et al. (2015), Franks et al. (2012)).</p>
        <p>Mergers and acquisitions are included when completed. If an acquisition occurs in stages, BvD data measure voting rights owned to date. 6 We match the BvD data to Datastream (Thompson Reuters) and Compustat (North America and Global) to obtain information on firms' market capitalization, industry classification, and stock exchange. Many researchers have used the ORBIS database (e.g., Franks et al. (2012), Masulis, Pham, andZein (2011)), but this database suffers from inconsistencies and errors (e.g., double entries), and information is missing for many companies (see also Kalemli-Ozcan et al. (2015)).</p>
        <p>We manually check the data and add information on control for firms with incomplete coverage.</p>
        <p>We assemble ownership information for 10, 857 (10, 146) listed corporations (with market capitalization information) whose ultimate controlling shareholder could not be traced from the BvD databases by gathering information from close to 7, 000 non listed firms using (i ) financial data providers such as Bloomberg, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Google Finance, Credit Risk Monitor, and Forbes, countries (see Morck et al. (2005), for a collection of case studies). Aganin andVolpin (2005), Morck et al. (2005) and Murphy (2005) give historical narratives of the evolution of ownership, control, and corporate governance in Italy, Canada, and France, respectively. Franks, Mayer, and Renneboog (2001) study the control of German corporations. Franks, Mayer, and Rossi (2009) and Franks, Mayer, and Miyajima (2014) study the evolution of ownership in the UK and Japan over the twentieth century. Kandel et al. (2019) provide a thorough historical analysis in the US. Chernykh (2008) discusses the obscure ownership of Russian listed firms.</p>
        <p>5 The BvD User Guide (2013) states "The Ownership Database intends to track control relationships rather than patrimonial relationships. This is why, when there are two categories of shares split into Voting/Non-voting shares, the percentages that are recorded are those attached to the category voting shares." Our manual checks indicate that the classification is appropriate (ENI (Italy), Portugal Telecom (before 2007), GDF Suez (France), and INPEX (Japan)).</p>
        <p>6 In discussion with BvD, they explained that when an acquisition occurs in stages, their data reflect actual voting rights owned to date. For example, if company A buys 100% of company B in two stages of 50% each year, then at the end of the first year the data will show 50% voting rights for firm A, and in the second year the voting rights will be 100%.</p>
        <p>(ii ) governmental publications, (iii ) reports from regulatory agencies, and (iv ) country-specific news websites. 7 Internet Appendix B provides examples of the manually collected information.</p>
        <p>A challenging task is identifying members of the same family and aggregating their voting rights, as they typically vote together. Using manual checks and applying name-matching algorithms, we partition the 63, 839 different individual private shareholders into 20, 334 families. 8 We assign all sovereign wealth funds to the government category. 9</p>
        <p>After merging the databases and manually "cleaning" the data as described above, our full sample contains 42, 720 publicly traded firms from 127 countries over the period 2004 to 2012. 10</p>
        <p>Our analyses employ three subsamples based on this sample.</p>
        <p>Post-Crisis Sample (2012). The 2012 sample, the year with the widest single-year coverage, includes 27, 913 publicly traded firms from 126 countries. 11 We drop firms from 34 countries and financial "offshore" centers that are not covered in Datastream and countries with just one firm. 12 This leaves us with 27, 539 listed firms in 92 countries. To have representative coverage in each country, we further require that we have at least 20% of the incorporated listed firms and at least 50% of the total market capitalization in a country, as reported in Datastream. This step results in the loss of 100 firms from seven countries with thin equity markets. 13 The 2012 sample therefore consists of 26, 843 firms in 85 countries. These countries represent approximately 95.2% of global GDP and 85% of the global population. This sample accounts for approximately 89% of the total value of market equity in the world sample of Datastream and 83% of global market capitalization based on the World Bank's estimates. The sample includes industrial, emerging, and underdeveloped countries in all parts of the world.</p>
        <p>The average (median) coverage in terms of market capitalization across the 85 countries is 83.1% (85.7%), since we miss data on small firms (mostly in the US, Canada, and Japan), the mean (median) coverage in terms of number of listed firms is 64.4% (65.5%). Coverage is almost perfect for 40 countries, for which our data include more than three-fourths of listed firms and coverage 7 While we aimed for a representative coverage in the manual checks, it proved "easier" to obtain ultimate control information from relatively larger companies in developed and middle-income countries.</p>
        <p>8 When family members hold voting shares in the same company at the same date, we aggregate their voting rights and assign them to the family representative shareholder. In the aggregation we face a trade-off. On the one hand, we may aggregate voting rights of family members who are in dispute. On the other hand, by not aggregating voting rights of family members, we may misclassify family-controlled firms.</p>
        <p>9 BvD often classifies sovereign wealth funds as government controlled. For example, the Qatar Investment Authority and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority are classified as government controlled agencies. This is not always the case, however. For example, BvD does not classify Temasek and Mubadala, the sovereign investment vehicles of Singapore and Abu Dhabi as government controlled.</p>
        <p>10 Compared to the initial sample of 134 countries, we lose 36 firms in Bolivia, El Salvador, Fiji, Guatemala, Honduras, Iran, and Syria. We lose 3, 943 firms from other countries because of missing market capitalization.</p>
        <p>11 Compared to the initial dataset, we lose listed firms from Togo.</p>
        <p>12 Specifically, we drop firms from Barbados, Anguilla, Bahamas, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Curacao, Gibraltar, Isle of Man, Jersey, Liechtenstein, Virgin Islands and Rwanda, for which we have just one firm, and firms from Palestine. Countries dropped due to missing market capitalization for firms include Belize, Benin, Cambodia, Cameroon, Faroe Islands, Gabon, Gambia, Georgia, Jamaica, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Macao, Malawi, Marshall Islands, Monaco, Mongolia, Niger, Panama, Senegal, Trinidad and Tobago, and Sudan. 13 We lose firms in Ecuador, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Mauritius, Tanzania, Vietnam, and Zimbabwe. 14 Compared to the 2012 sample, we lose firms in Bangladesh, Bosnia, Botswana, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Israel, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Namibia, Serbia, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, Uganda, and Zambia.</p>
        <p>15 For example, Ma Huateng is the founder and main shareholder of Tencent Inc, William Gates is the key shareholder of Microsoft, and Murray Edwards is the main shareholder of Canadian Natural Resources.</p>
        <p>16 For example, Rio Tinto International Holdings, a private firm, is a key shareholder of Turquoise Hill Resources, a Canadian mineral exploration and development company. Similarly, Kar-Tess Holding, a Luxembourg-based private company, is a shareholder of Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company, and Ramsbury Invest AB, a privately held Swedish company is a shareholder of H&amp;M.</p>

        <p>Identifying control is challenging as corporate law (with respect to managerial power, shareholder rights, civil procedure) differs around the world. Moreover, ownership structures can be complex, involving cross-holdings, pyramids, and intermediate firms. Most previous studies abstract from these issues and apply voting-rights cutoffs to identify controlled corporations. La Porta et al. (1999), for example, identify a firm as controlled if a shareholder (bank, individual, state, other firm) holds more than 20% of the voting rights of the firm. Lins, Volpin, and Wagner (2013) employ a 25% cutoff, while Laeven and Levine (2008) use 10%.</p>
        <p>Using voting-rights cutoffs is transparent and straightforward to implement. Like La Porta et al. (1999), we identify controlled firms as those in which a shareholder (individual, family, state, another firm) has voting rights over 20%. Compared to earlier work, however, our approach is distinct in two respects. First, through the manual checks, we aggregate the voting rights of all firms that a single individual (or family) uses to exercise control. For example, we cumulate the voting rights of all firms that Igor Zyuzin used to control Mechel, and in LVMH we cumulate the voting shares of all firms related to Bernard Arnault. Second, we aggregate the voting rights of all family members. In Fiat and BMW, for example, we cumulate the shares of all of the Agnellis and To account for such cases, we apply a control identification algorithm based on the weighted voting games literature pioneered by Shapley and Shubik (1954) and Banzhaf (1965). This literature uses relative (rather than absolute) voting-power cutoffs that take into account the full distribution of shareholders' shares. In Internet Appendix B, we provide details on the computation of the Shapley-Shubik measures which have not been widely used by the corporate finance literature.</p>
        <p>(Important exceptions include Rydqvist (1987Rydqvist ( , 1992)); Robinson and White (1990), and Rajan and Zingales ( 2004))</p>
        <p>We compare the classification using the two approaches, to gauge how well the simple, transparent cutoff rule that the literature has used so far fares against the more elaborate, computationally challenging Shapley-Shubik (1954) indicates that some firms are controlled even though the largest shareholder holds less than 20%.</p>
        <p>For a few countries (e.g., Botswana, Spain, Lebanon, and Hungary) the share of controlled firms is larger with the cutoff rule, but the differences are small. The firm (country) level correlation between the absolute and relative voting rights power measures is 0.80 (0.9); see Internet Appendix Tables IA-B.7 and IA-B.8.</p>
        <p>We aim to provide the most complete-to-date characterization of control of publicly traded corporations around the world. To do so, we first classify firms as either widely held or controlled.</p>
        <p>We next split widely held firms into those with a blockholder (ownership exceeding 5%) and those without any block ownership. which is larger than the corresponding firm-level mean of 0.46, as the sample contains a large number of firms from countries with a low share of corporate control (the US, Canada, the UK).</p>
        <p>At one extreme, the Berle and Means (1932) type of corporation with many small shareholders is almost absent in Africa (more than 75% of the firms are controlled in Uganda, the Ivory Coast, 24 Blockholders may be passive or more actively engaged in corporate decisions. This may be related to their type, the legal system, and the power of other shareholders. As we do not have much information on blockholders' voting, we leave to future research a more in-depth examination of their role.</p>
        <p>25 Appendix Table IA Ghana, Namibia, Botswana, and Kenya) and Eastern Europe (more than 75% of the firms have a controlling shareholder in the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Romania, and Russia ). At the other extreme, the share of listed controlled firms is low (below 30%) in New Zealand, Canada, the US, the UK, Ireland, Australia, and Taiwan. There is also nonnegligible variation within regions.</p>
        <p>For instance, in Western Europe, the share of controlled firms ranges from around 80% in Austria, Malta, and Greece to around 20% in the UK and Ireland, with Spain and Switzerland in the middle at 50%. In Asia, corporate control ranges from 78% in Indonesia to around 20% to 30% in Australia and Taiwan and around 47% in India.</p>
        <p>Family Firms. Figure 4, Panel A shows the extent of family-controlled firms around the world in 2012. The cross-country mean (median) is 17.5% (16.7%). When we add firms controlled by unidentified private owners, as most of these firms are likely controlled by families/individuals (Faccio and Lang (2002), Masulis, Pham, and Zein ( 2011)), the cross-country average (median) doubles. Family control is pervasive in countries with strong family ties, such as Greece, Italy, Portugal, Argentina, and Lebanon Alesina and Giuliano (2014). There are few family-controlled listed corporations in Taiwan, Ireland, and Australia.</p>
        <p>State-Controlled Firms. Figure 4, Panel B depicts the extent of state control around the world in 2012. Government control is close to zero (less than 1%) in 18 countries (e.g.,the US, Canada, Latvia, Estonia) whereas it exceeds 20% in 11 countries, mostly in Africa (e.g., Uganda, Ghana) and the Arab world (Oman, Qatar, UAE), as well as in Russia and China.</p>
        <p>While our focus is on corporate control, we also calculate ownership concentration statistics by summing the voting rights of the one, three, and five largest shareholders (C1, C3, and C5).</p>
        <p>Construction of these measures follows prior literature (e.g., La Porta et al. (1999), Faccio and Lang (2002)), although in contrast to previous work, we sum the voting rights of all family members (treating them as one representative shareholder). Table I -B.14 to IA-B.15 give the global mapping). On average, the single largest shareholder (family) holds 31.5% of the equity of publicly traded corporations and the largest three (five) shareholders (families) jointly control 41.7% (44.6%) of a firm's voting rights.</p>
        <p>The cross-country averages are larger, at 41.3%, 53.1%, and 56%, respectively, as the sample is tilted towards countries with relatively low concentration. Ownership concentration that correlates strongly with corporate control (correlations exceeding 0.8) is highest in Africa and Eastern Europe and lowest in Taiwan, Canada, the US, the UK, Australia, and South Korea.</p>
        <p>We next examine the evolution of ownership concentration and corporate control over the period 2004 to 2012. This is a brief period to study dynamics; yet, as it includes the US financial meltdown of 2007 to 2009, the subsequent global recession, and the euro crisis, it allows us to examine the impact of large economic shocks on corporate structure. In Figure 5, Panels A and B we plot the evolution of C3 and the share of controlled firms. Since ORBIS coverage changes over time, we plot the concentration index and the corporate control share for a balanced sample of 9, 957 firms in 70 countries. The capitalization of these firms in 2012 ( 2007) is $41, 542 ($49, 193) billion, approximately 74% of the total market cap of our sample in the two years. We find that concentration and control are persistent, although there are some changes. As we show in Internet Appendix B, this pattern of stability is present across both advanced economies and to a lesser extent middle-income countries.</p>
        <p>The stable share of controlled firms may be due to ownership not changing for any firm over time or to changes in control cancelling out (i.e., widely held corporations becoming controlled while at the same time controlled firms become widely held). To examine this question we employ the sample of 9, 957 firms for which we have information throughout the 2004 to 2012 period as well as a larger sample of 15, 930 firms for which we have information for both 2012 and 2007.</p>
        <p>In this section we report results on the relation between corporate control and legal origin.</p>
        <p>First, we begin by discussing our empirical specification. Next, we report main results using probit and hierarchical analysis. In the third subsection, we report results on the association between ownership concentration and legal origin. Finally, we conduct sensitivity checks.</p>
        <p>To provide evidence on the cross-sectional association (in 2012 and 2007) between corporate control and legal origin, we start with the following specification:</p>
        <p>The dependent variable, y i,c , is an indicator equal to one if firm i in country c is controlled (by an individual/family, a private firm for which we could not identify the ultimate shareholder, the government, or a widely held private/public firm) and zero if the firm is widely held (with or without a block). Because the dependent variable is binary, we estimate probit models with maximum likelihood, so φ denotes the standard normal.</p>
        <p>The key explanatory variables capture a country's legal origin (LO c ). We include French, German, and Scandinavian civil-law legal origin indicator variables, using common-law legal origin as the omitted category.foot_8 Regional (continental) constants are given by a r . 27 In several specifications we include the log of per capita GDP (Z ) which we take as a summary measure of a country's economic, institutional, and financial development. A number of specifications also include sector constants, a s (based on two-digit SIC codes). The vector X i,c contains firm-level controls. Following Holderness (2016a,b), we control for firm age (log number of years since incorporation) and size (log market capitalization).</p>
        <p>We also run specifications pooling observations over the period 2004 to 2012, as this maximizes coverage (42, 720 firms in 127 countries). The pooled specification is</p>
        <p>Here the dependent variable denotes control of firm i in country c in year t, a t are year constants, and the control variables (GDP per capita, firm age, and capitalization) are time-varying.</p>
        <p>Before reporting the results, it is important to stress that legal origin may affect corporate control through multiple channels, such as investor protection, court efficiency, product market regulation, and labor laws (see La Porta, Lopez-de Silanes, and Shleifer ( 2008)). The coefficients on the legal origin indicators capture the "reduced-form" relationship between legal family/tradition and corporate control. We also stress that although most countries' legal system was shaped hundreds of years ago, imposed by colonial powers, the estimates do not reflect causal relationships.</p>
        <p>Colonization was not random, and the identity of colonial powers may affect long-run development via mechanisms other than legal origin. country's legal tradition is related to hard-to-account-for features relevant to corporate control. Roe (2006) stresses the role of considerable differences in war-related damages during the 20th century between common-law and civil-law countries, while Damaška (1986) and other legal scholars emphasize differences in the role of government. Since the legal origin indicators (and GDP per capita) take the same value for all firms in a country, we cluster standard errors at the country level (Moulton (1990)).</p>
        <p>Table II reports the baseline results. Since probit coefficients are not readily interpretable, the table presents average marginal effects, which capture the difference in the likelihood that the company is controlled across legal families. Panel A reports results for specifications in which we use the 20% cutoff to identify control, while Panel B reports analogous results when we use the Shapley-Shubik (1954) algorithm to identify control.</p>
        <p>Column (1) reports unconditional estimates. The test of means suggests that the share of controlled firms, as identified by the cutoff rule, is 33.5 percentage points higher in French civil-law countries as compared to common-law countries. The estimate when we use the Shapley-Shubik (1954) approach is somewhat smaller, at 0.28. Both coefficients are highly significant. Compared to common-law countries, the share of controlled firms is roughly 18 (14) percentage points higher in German civil-law countries with the 20% cutoff rule (Shapley-Shubik algorithm). Differences in corporate control between common-law and Scandinavian civil-law countries are muted.</p>
        <p>In column (2) we control for (log) GDP per capita, which enters with a significantly negative coefficient. The estimates on the French and German legal origin variables are not affected much.</p>
        <p>The coefficient on the French civil-law indicator is positive and highly significant in both panels; the likelihood of listed firms having a controlling shareholder, as compared to being widely held, is 25 to 30 percentage points higher for countries whose legal system is based on the Napoleonic civil codes, as compared to (mostly) British colonies that have a common-law system. The German civil-law and the Scandinavian civil-law dummy variables enter with positive and significant estimates; the probability of a listed firm having a controlling shareholder is 11 to 15 percentage points higher in German civil-law and 8 to 10 percentage points higher in Scandinavian civil-law countries.</p>
        <p>In column (3) we add continental fixed effects. The regional constants are significant (coefficients not shown), as widely held corporations are less frequent in Sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia (Figure 3). The coefficient on the French legal origin indicator retains significance (0.25 in Panel A and 0.22 in Panel B). The estimates on the German and Scandinavian legal origin indicators decrease somewhat, and their standard errors increase, rendering the coefficients insignificant. This is due to the limited within-region variation for some legal families. There are no Scandinavian civil-law countries outside Western Europe and there are no common-law countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Differences between common-law and civil-law countries (when we pool French, German, and Scandinavian civil-law countries) are considerable in Sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia and the Pacific, and the Americas.</p>
        <p>In column (4) we add industry constants as well as log firm age and log market capitalization.</p>
        <p>Adding sectoral fixed effects is a priori necessary, as there are differences in ownership structure across sectors (e.g. Faccio and Lang (2002)). Size and age may be related to a country's legal tradition and stage of economic development (Holderness (2016a)). Both variables enter with coefficients that are small and statistically indistinguishable from zero. The insignificance suggests that as firms mature ownership does not mechanically get more dispersed (see also Claessens, Djankov, and Lang (2000), and Franks et al. (2012)). The average marginal effects on the legal origin indicators retain their magnitudes. Since the sample decreases when we condition on firm age which is an insignificant correlate of control, in column (5) we omit it. Conditional on the relevant regional features, industry characteristics, and GDP, the likelihood of a firm having a controlling owner is 20 to 23 percentage points higher in French civil-law countries as compared to common-law countries.</p>
        <p>In columns ( 6) and ( 7), we examine the association between control and legal origin in 2007. The likelihood (average marginal effect) that a listed firm is controlled is 23 percentage points higher in French civil-law countries, as compared to common-law countries. The likelihood of controlled firms is approximately 15 percentage points higher in German civil law countries. Corporate control is also higher in Scandinavian civil-law countries, though the coefficient (0.09 to 0.10) does not pass standard significance levels. These results imply that the global financial crisis did not affect the association between corporate control and legal origin.</p>
        <p>In columns ( 8) and ( 9), we report pooled sample cross-sectional estimates (based on equation ( 2)), which maximizes firm and country coverage. Conditional on industry and regional differences, as well as log GDP per capita, we find that the share of controlled firms is, on average, 26, 15, and 8 percentage points higher in countries of French, German, and Scandinavian civil-law tradition, respectively, as compared to common-law countries.</p>
        <p>A couple of examples illustrate the above results. The fraction of controlled firms in Malaysia, a common-law country, is 0.55, while the corresponding share in Indonesia, a Dutch colony with a French civil-law system is 0.78. The share of controlled firms in Cyprus (0.40), a former British colony, is almost half of the analogous share in Greece (0.76), a French civil-law country. And the share of controlled firms in common-law Nigeria is 0.68, while in French civil-law Ivory Coast it is 0.93.</p>
        <p>In sum, the results in Table II show that in our large sample of firms and countries, the crosscountry correlations between corporate control and legal origin are similar using the 20% cutoff rule and the more elaborate Shapley-Shubik (1954) power index. These results suggest that previous studies that rely on simple cutoff rules are quite accurate, at least when the sample size is large.</p>
        <p>In most widely held firms, there is at least one block shareholder. For example, Bill Gates holds a significant stake in Microsoft, Blackrock and Fidelity hold blocks in Apple, and Berkshire</p>
        <p>Hathaway holds a large stake in IBM. In Europe, Groupe Bruxelles Lambert holds a block of Total and the Kuwait Investment Corporation holds 5.7% of the voting rights of Daimler. Block shareholders can exert some control (see Edmans and Holderness (2017)). It is therefore important (if not commonly done) to account for blocks in the empirical analysis as they are widespread and hence the results may depend on how one classifies firms with dispersed ownership but sizable blocks (Holderness (2009)).</p>
        <p>We construct an ordered index (0, 1, 2) that accommodates heterogeneity on the degree of corporate control and estimate hierarchical model specifications that are designed to study such phenomena (Wooldridge (2002), Greene ( 2011)). More specifically, we first set the trichotomous index to zero for widely held firms without a block (all shareholders hold less than 5% of voting rights), one for widely held firms with at least one block (over 5%), and two for controlled firms. 28We then estimate ordered probit models (with maximum likelihood) that associate the ordered index with legal origin. Third, the coefficients on the German and Scandinavian civil-law dummies are positive but not always significant. Fourth, log GDP per capita enters with a significantly negative coefficient.</p>
        <p>Fifth, size and age do not systematically correlate with control. In Figure 6, Panel A we plot the estimated likelihoods (average marginal effects) of the three outcomes for each legal family using the specification with the rich set of controls in the 2004 to 2012 sample (column (8)), as this allows us to visualize at which margin legal origin operates. For comparability, Figure 6, Panel B plots the unconditional likelihoods. The marginal effects in Panel A imply that conditional on regional characteristics and the level of development, the likelihood that a key shareholder will control a listed firm in a French civil-law country is 66.4%, similar to the unconditional likelihood of 66.8%.</p>
        <p>The regression estimates further imply that in French civil-law countries 31% of listed firms will be widely held with a block shareholder and only 2.8% of listed firms will have dispersed ownership without any block shareholder. These estimates are close to the simple means. Turning to the common-law countries, the estimates imply that 10% of listed firms will be widely held without a block and 57.5% of listed firms will be widely held with a block. These estimates are close to their unconditional values (12.5% and 53%, respectively).</p>
        <p>Table IV reports OLS estimates associating ownership concentration with legal origin. The unconditional specification in (1) shows that, compared to common-law countries, the voting-rights share of the three largest shareholders is 25 percentage points higher in French legal origin countries. Ownership concentration is six to seven percentage points higher in German and Scandinavian civil-law countries. The legal origin indicators explain 10% of the total variance in ownership concentration. This is far from negligible, as country fixed effects explain 25% of the variability, and thus legal origin explains 40% of the variance captured by all country-level characteristics.</p>
        <p>Figure 7, Panels A and B illustrates the differences in ownership concentration between commonlaw and French civil-law countries in 2012 using the C3 measure and the C5 measure, respectively.</p>
        <p>The panels provide overlapping histograms of ownership concentration for common-law countries (13, 986 firms in 28 countries) and French civil-law countries (4, 516 firms in 33 countries). Ownership concentration in French civil-law countries is tilted to the right of the common-law distribution.</p>
        <p>The median C3 in common-law countries is 29.01%, while in French civil-law countries it is 62.17%.</p>
        <p>The 25th percentile of the distribution of C3 in common-law countries is 13.84%, while in French civil-law it is 42.98%. The 75th percentile of C3 in common-law countries is 51.96% and in French civil-law countries it is 81.79%.</p>
        <p>The estimate on the French civil-law indicator is not affected by the inclusion of log GDP per capita, industry fixed effects, and the firm controls. It declines somewhat when we add the regional constants. Conditional on GDP, industry, and unobservable regional characteristics, the voting rights of the three largest shareholders are 15 percentage points higher in French civil-law countries, as compared to common-law countries. A couple of examples illustrate these results. The average value of the C3 index for the 14 publicly traded firms in Ghana, a former British colony with a common-law system, is 63.1%, while the C3 for the 14 firms incorporated in neighboring Ivory Coast, a French civil-law country, is 72.9%. (GDP per capita is similar in the two countries, at approximately 1, 500USD, as is total market capitalization, around 2 billion USD). In East Asia, the average C3 in French civil-law Indonesia is 63.4%, while in common-law Thailand it is 45.2%.</p>
        <p>Above we show that cross-country correlations are quite stable over time, across methods to identify control, and with or without the inclusion of firm controls. In Internet Appendix B, we report results of additional sensitivity checks (see Internet Appendix Tables IA-B.IX to B.XV II).</p>
        <p>First, we examine whether the patterns are similar using alternative estimation techniques (linear probability models, logits, and multinomial logits) and alternative measures of ownership concentration. We find that our results are not sensitive to the choice of estimation method or measure of ownership concentration. Second, we examine whether some regions drive the documented patterns.</p>
        <p>We find that differences between civil-law and common-law countries are economically sizable in Western Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Americas. Differences are also present in Asia and the Pacific, although the estimates are not statistically significant. In the Middle East and North</p>
        <p>Africa, there are no major differences in control across civil-law and common-law countries. Third, we examine whether specific countries drive our results. When we drop the US, which comprises around 15% to 18% of the firm sample, the main patterns remain intact. When we drop the top three countries in terms of the number of observations (the US, Canada, and China), which reduces the sample by roughly 30%, we continue to find that corporate control is significantly higher in French civil-law countries.foot_11 Fourth, we examine whether the results hold when we average control (or ownership concentration) across firms in each country and run cross-country regressions. We find that results are similar, albeit a bit more imprecise.</p>
        <p>The size distribution of publicly traded firms is highly skewed (see Gabaix (2009Gabaix ( , 2016) ) and the references therein). In our sample, the mean market capitalization is 1.55 billion USD, while the median is 10 times lower at 0.15 billion USD. Given such skewness, merely controlling for market capitalization may be inadequate. At the same time, the relationship between corporate control and legal origin may differ for small, medium, and large firms. Part of Holderness' (2016a; 2016b) critique of La Porta et al. (1999) relates to the unequal distribution of listed firms. In this section we use the richness of the newly compiled data to explore heterogeneity across firm size and age. In columns ( 4) and ( 5) we split the sample using the median value of firm market capitalization.</p>
        <p>The French civil-law indicator is highly significant in both samples. This result adds to the law and finance literature, as it demonstrates that the "reduced-form" link between corporate control and legal origin holds across both big and small listed corporations.</p>
        <p>The regressions also reveal an additional result. The negative association between log GDP per capita and corporate control is particularly strong for large firms; the coefficient on log output per capita in the large-firm sample is -0.1 and highly significant. In contrast, log GDP per capita enters with an estimate that is close to zero and statistically insignificant in the small-firm sample. A similar pattern applies for ownership concentration. This result, while new in the corporate finance literature, echoes Hsieh and Klenow (2014), who study plant-level productivity across firms' life cycle in Mexico, India, and the US, and find that differences are strong for large plants and in late stages of firms' life cycle. Our results add to these findings by showing that economic development relates to the corporate structure of large firms which tend to be the most productive (e.g. Syverson ( 2011)).</p>
        <p>In columns ( 6) and ( 7) we restrict attention to large firms using the top 10% and top 5%, In columns ( 8) and ( 9) we estimate separately the specifications for "young" and "old" firms, using the median firm age (22 years). Examining heterogeneity across firm age is useful, as earlier studies by Franks et al. (2012), Foley and Greenwood (2010), and Holderness (2016a,b) document that in some countries only older firms manage to raise outside equity. The positive marginal effect of the French civil-law legal origin is present and similar in magnitude in both subsamples, which</p>
        <p>shows again that the negative GDP-control association applies to both young and old firms. Taken together, the evidence in V suggests that the reduced-form link between corporate control and legal origin is quite strong.</p>
        <p>The law and finance literature (La Porta et al. (1997Porta et al. ( , 1998))) stresses the role of minority shareholders' rights against expropriation by company insiders in shaping corporate control. Legal origin is related to other institutional and regulatory features of capital, product, and labor markets (e.g. Djankov et al. (2002Djankov et al. ( , 2003)), Botero et al. (2004)). For instance, as La Porta, Lopez-de Silanes, and Shleifer (2006) observe, in its "strong form" common law promotes dispute resolution with little state involvement or regulation. In contrast, civil law is "policy implementing," that is, "a strategy of social control " over markets that depends on professional judges who interpret rather than create law and a government that actively intervenes in markets (Beck, Demirgüç-Kunt, and Levine (2003)). Legal scholars also stress the connection between civil law and an "interventionist" state that tightly regulates capital, labor, and product markets (Roe (2000(Roe ( , 2006)), Bebchuk and Roe (1999)).</p>
        <p>In this section we examine the association between corporate control (and ownership concentration) and (i ) proxies for investor protection (ii ) court efficiency (iii ) red tape in entering a market, and (iv ) various aspects of labor market regulation. 30 Cross-country correlations do not identify causal effects, as endogeneity may arise due to, for example, omitted variables, related to trust, social values, and religion (e.g. Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales (2004, 2006, 2011), Stulz and Williamson (2003)), reverse causation, from a high share of widely held firms to sound investor protection (Rajan and Zingales ( 2003)), and errors-in-variables, related to measures of institutional capacity (for example the World Bank has revised its methodology in measuring legal quality, barriers to entry, capital, product, and labor market institutions multiple times). However, the cross-country associations are useful in assessing the strength of the correlation of these factors with corporate control.</p>
        <p>Figure 8 summarizes results of the correlational analysis for the pooled 2004 to 2012 sample. In particular, the graph plots the univariate correlation between corporate control and institutional proxies for investor protection, quality of the courts, barriers to entry, and labor market regulation.</p>
        <p>The dots correspond to point estimates (bold red dots denote statistically significant correlations)</p>
        <p>and the horizontal lines depict 95% confidence intervals (based on standard errors clustered at the country level). In the remainder of this section, we discuss these correlations in more detail. 31</p>
        <p>We first examine the association between corporate control and investor protection, the mechanism emphasized by the law and finance literature as explaining the "reduced-form" correlation between control and legal origin. Table VI reports results, conditioning on industry fixed effects, regional constants, and GDP per capita, for the 2012, 2007, and 2004 to 2012 samples. For brevity, we report results using the 20% cutoff rule.</p>
        <p>In columns (1), (4), and (7) we proxy for investor protection using a 0 to 6 shareholder protection index and 0 to 4 creditor rights index. The measures come from Djankov, McLiesh, and Shleifer (2007), and Djankov et al. (2008a) who expand, correct, and update the original indicators of La Porta et al. (1997Porta et al. ( , 1998)). We include the two measures jointly, as their correlation is weak (0.26). We find no systematic association between corporate control and creditor rights. The average marginal effect on the antidirectors rights index is negative, but the coefficient does not pass standard significance thresholds. The results are similar for ownership concentration.</p>
        <p>In columns (2), ( 5) and ( 8) we associate corporate control with the Djankov et al. (2008b) antiself-dealing index which quantifies minority shareholders' rights against self-dealing transactions of corporate insiders. This composite index captures ex-ante and ex-post privateF enforcement mechanisms available to minority shareholders to check self-dealing activities of managers and controlling shareholders. Ex-ante mechanisms include requirements for the approval of disinterested shareholders, disclosure mandates, and independent reviews by auditors or financial experts. Expost mechanisms include disclosure in periodic filings, access to evidence, and the ease with which managers and controlling shareholders can sue in the event of misconduct. Following Djankov et al.</p>
        <p>(2008b), we include an index of the public enforcement of shareholders' rights. The anti-self-dealing index enters with a negative coefficient that is significant in the 2007 and 2004 to 2012 samples.</p>
        <p>Stronger legal protection from minority shareholders from self-dealing transactions by company insiders is therefore associated with a higher likelihood that a firm is widely held. The public enforcement index is insignificant, which suggests that imprisonment and hefty fines are not much related to control.</p>
        <p>In columns (3), ( 6), and ( 9) we include both anti-self dealing measures in the regression as their correlation is 0.15. The ex-post anti-self-dealing index enters with a negative and highly significant estimate, in both ordered probit estimation and OLS with ownership concentration. The average marginal effect in 2012 implies that a one-standard-deviation increase in minority shareholders protections against insiders' self-dealing activities is associated with a 7.5 percentage points higher likelihood that the listed firm will be widely held as compared to controlled.</p>
        <p>Legal origin is also related to the efficiency of the court system. For instance, Djankov et al. (2003) show that differences in court formalism across legal families on courts' formalism affects financial development. In Table VII we associate corporate control (in columns (1) to ( 6)) and ownership concentration (in ( 7) to ( 9)) with the logarithm of the number of days it takes to resolve a simple dispute via the court system (from Djankov, McLiesh, and Shleifer (2007)). Columns (1) to (3) report probit average marginal effects with the control indicator as the outcome variable, columns (4) to (6) report ordered probit coefficients with the trichotomous index of control, and columns (7)to (9) report OLS estimates with the C3 concentration index as the dependent variable.</p>
        <p>The results point to a weak association, as the coefficient on the legal formalism proxy is small. Moreover, while in some specifications, the coefficient on the legal formalism proxy does pass significance levels, it turns insignificant when we identify control using the Shapley-Shubik (1954) method (Internet Appendix Table IA-B.XXVI). Given the somewhat inconclusive patterns, we also employ alternative measures of court efficiency from Djankov et al. (2003), namely the number of days it takes to evict a tenant for nonpayment and the number of days it takes to collect a bounced cheque. We find mostly insignificant and unstable cross-country correlations (see also Figure 8).</p>
        <p>Thus, corporate control and ownership concentration are not influenced by legal formalism to a significant degree.</p>
        <p>Product market regulations that impede entry and protect incumbents may affect corporate control through various mechanisms (Tirole (1988(Tirole ( , 2006))). For example, firms in oligopolistic markets, that are shielded from competition by entrants may be able to finance projects via retained earnings and as a result depend less on external sources of financing. Such firms are therefore much more likely to be controlled by families/individuals. Similarly, state control may be higher in countries where governments are more likely to "intervene" in product markets governments (Roe (2006)). In countries with concentrated ownership, corporate owners can lobby for more protectionist policies.</p>
        <p>In Table VIII, we associate corporate control with three proxies for barriers to entry, namely, the log of the number of days and the log of the number of administrative procedures needed to start a business and the associated cost, as a share of GDP per capita. We use the measures compiled by the World Bank, as they cover more countries than the original Djankov et al. (2002) data. For brevity, we report probit average marginal effects; in Internet Appendix B we repeat results using ownership concentration and the trichotomous index of control. The coefficients on the log of the number of days and the cost of starting a new business are small and statistically indistinguishable from zero. There is some link between corporate control and the log of the number of procedures to start a new business, but the implied effect is small.</p>
        <p>We next examine the correlation between corporate control and labor market institutions. Corporate control and welfare state policies have co-evolved, reenforcing each other since the Great Depression and the World Wars (Rajan and Zingales (2003,2004)). Mueller and Philippon (2011) argue that family firms can more easily sidestep stringent labor regulations. Roe (2006) argues that laws that make it expensive to fire workers and regulations that promote the existence of unions prevent ownership diffusion. Pagano and Volpin (2005) develop a model in which large private benefits of control nudge controlling shareholders to collaborate with employees by offering long-term contracts and other benefits in exchange for "effective protection" from hostile takeovers. Labor market regulation could affect corporate structure by raising the cost of bankruptcy, and in turn reducing the use of external finance (Simintzi, Vig, and Volpin (2014)).</p>
        <p>In Table IX, we associate corporate control and concentration with the three labor market regulation measures of Botero et al. (2004): (i) an "employment laws" index that captures the existence and cost of nonstandard employment contract(s), overtime pay costs, dismissal procedures, and firing costs, (ii) a "collective relations" index that reflects the statutory power of unions and the protection of workers via collective dispute resolution mechanisms, and (iii) a "social security"</p>
        <p>index that measures the level and duration of unemployment, health, old-age, disability, and death benefits.</p>
        <p>We find a significantly positive correlation between control and the collective relations index. In countries where unions are powerful, a large fraction of workers are unionized, and where there are strong collective dispute resolution mechanisms, listed corporations are more likely to be controlled by families/individuals or the state, as compared to being widely held. The estimate in the 2012 sample implies that a 0.20 point increase in the collective actions index, which corresponds to the mean difference between common-law countries (0.29) and civil-law countries (0.50), increases the likelihood that the firm has a controlling owner by 12 percentage points. There is no systematic association between corporate control and social security legislation. Finally, while control is unconditionally related to the collective relations index (Figure 8), the correlation becomes insignificant when we control for log GDP per capita.</p>
        <p>Employing a large number of sources and conducting manual checks for thousands of firms, we extend the ORBIS database of corporate ownership and construct a new data set on corporate control around the world. Our database covers 42, 720 listed firms from 127 countries between 2004 and 2012. Using absolute cutoff-based and relative voting-rights power measures, we classify firms as controlled, widely held, or widely held without a controlling shareholder but with equity blocks.</p>
        <p>Our analysis then proceeds in three steps. First, we provide an anatomy of corporate control around the world. We show that family control is pervasive across industrial, developing, and frontier economies. State ownership is far from negligible, especially in terms of market capitalization, as in many countries (e.g., Russia, China, Brazil, India) the government holds controlling stakes in large firms.</p>
        <p>Second, we examine the association between corporate control (and ownership concentration) and legal origin. We show that ownership is more concentrated and control by families and the government is more pervasive in French civil-law and to a lesser extent German civil-law countries.</p>
        <p>These patterns are present in large, medium, and small listed firms. Moewover, while equity blocks in widely held firms are common, they are more pervasive in French civil-law countries. Our analysis also uncovers a new result: the negative correlation between development and corporate control is present only in the sample of large corporations; it is absent in below-median market capitalization firms, while it is strong in the global sample of very large firms. This heterogeneity suggests that financial frictions associated with low GDP per capita, may prevent firms from raising equity and growing (Hsieh and Klenow (2014), Rajan and Zingales ( 2004)).</p>
        <p>Third, we associate corporate control with institutional characteristics related to legal origin.</p>
        <p>We find that provisions that protect minority shareholders from self-dealing activities of dominant shareholders are significant correlates of corporate control. This result supports one of the key insights of the law and finance literature on the substitutability of control and weak shareholder protection (La Porta, Lopez-de Silanes, and Shleifer (2006)) in the widest sample of firms and countries to date. Corporate control is unrelated to creditors' rights protection and is weakly related to court efficiency. Labor market institutions correlate strongly with corporate control, suggesting spillovers from labor to capital markets and vice versa. Ownership concentration and the prevalence of controlled firms are higher in countries with strong employment protection laws and strong unions. These results are in line with the historical co-evolution of the welfare state, family control, and direct government intervention in the economy (Roe (2006), Rajan and Zingales ( 2004)).</p>
        <p>The results are also consistent with political economy theories of corporate control modeling the alliances between controlling shareholders and employees at the expense of minority shareholders (e.g. Pagano and Volpin (2005)).</p>
        <p>We view this paper as a first step in reassessing fundamental questions in corporate finance, related to the determinants and consequences of corporate ownership. Our analysis abstracts from the exact role of blockholders on corporate affairs; blockholders may be passive or exert an active role, depending on the country's institutions, the distribution of equity holdings, and the block- Ordered Control Index: A trichotomous (0, 1, 2) index of control that accounts for equity blocks in widely held corporations. The variable takes the value of zero for widely held firms without a block (all shareholders/families hold less than 5% of the firm's voting rights), one for widely held firms with at least one block (in excess of 5% of the firm's voting rights), and two for firms with a controlling shareholder (of any type). There are two vintages of this variable. The first is based on identification of corporate control using the absolute 20% voting-rights cutoff method.</p>
        <p>The second is based on identification of corporate control using the Shapley-Shubik (1954)</p>

The sample comprises 26,843 firms in 85 countries in 2012. Identification of controlled corporations is based on the 20% absolute voting-rights cutoff. The table also reports the cross-country average, median, and standard deviation. Table II Corporate Control and Legal Origin, Probit (ML) Estimates</p>
        <p>The table reports firm-level probit (maximum likelihood) estimates (average marginal effects). The dependent variable is an indicator that takes the value of one if a firm is controlled (by either an individual/family, a private firm with an unmatched ultimate owner, the government, a widely held private firm, or a widely held public firm) and zero if the firm is widely held (with or without a block). The key explanatory variables are legal origin indicator variables that take the value of one for French civil-law, German civil-law, and Scandinavian civil-law countries, respectively, with common-law legal origin serving as the omitted category. Panel A reports estimates when we use the 20% voting-rights cutoff rule to identify controlled corporations. Panel B reports estimates when we use the Shapley-Shubik (1954) relative voting power approach to identify controlled corporations. The specifications in columns (1) to ( 5) are estimated on the 2012 sample, the specifications in columns ( 6) and ( 7) are estimated on the 2007 sample, and the specifications in columns ( 8) and ( 9) are estimated on the pooled 2004 to 2012 sample that maximizes coverage (42,720 firms).</p>
        <p>The specifications in columns (3) to (9) include continental fixed effects (constants not reported) following the World Bank's regional classification. The specifications in columns (4), ( 5), ( 7), and (9) include industry fixed effects using two-digit SIC classifications (85 sectors, constants not reported).

The specifications in columns ( 4), ( 7), and ( 9 The table reports firm-level (ordered) probit (maximum likelihood) coefficients. The dependent variable is an ordered index of corporate control. The trichotomous index that serves as the dependent variable takes the value of zero for widely held firms without a block (all shareholders/families hold less than 5% of the firm's voting rights), one for widely held firms with at least one block (in excess of 5%), and two for firms with a controlling shareholder (of any type).

The specifications in columns (2) to (9) control for the logarithm of GDP per capita in a given year. The specifications in columns ( 4), (7), and (9) include as controls log firm age and log market capitalization. The table reports firm-level OLS estimates. The dependent variable is the C3 index of ownership concentration which reflects the voting rights held by the three largest shareholders (treating family members as one representative shareholder with aggregated voting rights).

In columns (1),</p>
        <p>(2), and (3) we drop the largest firms in terms of market capitalization, using the global top 1%, 5%, and 10% cutoff, respectively. In columns ( 4) and ( 5) we focus on small and large firms using as the cutoff the (world-sample) median value of firm market capitalization. In columns ( 6) and ( 7) we restrict estimation to large firms in terms of market capitalization using the top 10% and top 5% global market capitalization cutoff, respectively. In columns ( 8) and ( 9) we focus on relatively young and relatively old firms using as the cutoff the (world-sample) median firm age (years since incorporation), which is 22 years. In all specifications, we control for the logarithm of GDP per capita in 2012. All specifications include regional fixed effects (constants not reported) following the World Bank's regional classification, industry fixed effects, using two-digit SIC classifications (85 sectors, constants not reported), and firm-level controls for size (log market capitalization) and age (log number of years since incorporation The table reports firm-level probit (maximum likelihood) estimates (average marginal effects) associating corporate control with measures of investor protection rights. The dependent variable is an indicator that takes the value of one if a firm is controlled (by an individual/family, a private firm with an unmatched ultimate owner, the government, a widely held private firm, or a widely held public firm) and zero if the firm is widely held (with or without a block). For the identification of controlled corporations we use the 20% voting-rights cutoff. The key explanatory variables are proxies for shareholder and creditor protection rights. The revised antidirectors rights index, which ranges from 0 to 6, captures the protection of minority shareholders in corporate decision-making, including the right to vote. A score of 1 is assigned for each of the following rights that apply: (i) vote by mail, (ii) obstacles to the actual exercise of the right to vote (i.e., the requirement that shares be deposited before the shareholders' meeting), (iii) minority representation on the board of directors through cumulative voting or proportional representation, (iv) an oppressed minority mechanism to seek redress in the case of expropriation, (v) pre-emptive rights to subscribe to new securities issued by the company, and (vi) the right to call a special shareholders' meeting. The ex-ante private control of self-dealing index which ranges from 0 to 1, captures (i) disclosures by the buyer and the seller, and (ii) whether a positive independent review of the transaction is required, as well as whether the transaction must be approved by disinterested shareholders. The ex-post private control of self-dealing index, which ranges from 0 to 1, captures (i) post-transaction legal provisions to hold the buyer and seller liable for bad faith, (ii) the ability of shareholders to sue or rescind the transaction, (iii) the ability of shareholders to access evidence on the transaction, and (iv) disclosure of evidence in periodic filings. The composite anti-self-dealing index is the average of the ex-ante and ex-post private control of self-dealing measures, which range from 0 to 1. The public enforcement index, which ranges from 0 to 1, captures disclosure requirements for self-dealing transactions by managers and controlling shareholders. All variables come from Djankov et al. (2008b). The creditor rights index ranges from 0 to 4. A score of 1 is assigned for each of the following rights of secured lenders defined in laws and regulations: (i) there are restrictions, such as creditor consent or minimum dividends, for a debtor to file for reorganization, (ii) secured creditors are able to seize their collateral after the reorganization petition is approved (i.e., there is no automatic stay or asset freeze), (iii) secured creditors are paid first out of the proceeds of liquidating a bankrupt firm, as opposed to other creditors such as the government or workers, and (iv) management does not retain administration of the property pending the resolution of the reorganization. The index comes from Djankov, McLiesh, and Shleifer (2007), who extend, revise, and update the original index compiled by La Porta et al. (1997Porta et al. ( , 1998)). In all regressions we use the mean value over the period 1978 to 2003. The specifications in columns (1) to (3) are estimated on the 2012 sample, the specifications in columns (4) to (6) are estimated on the 2007 sample, and the specifications in columns ( 7) to ( 9) are estimated on the pooled 2004 to 2012 sample that maximizes coverage (42,720 firms). All specifications include continental fixed effects (constants not reported) following the World Bank's regional classification, industry fixed effects using two-digit SIC classifications (85 sectors, constants not reported), and the logarithm of GDP per capita. The pooled specifications in columns ( 7) to ( 9) also include year fixed effects (constants not reported). The Data Appendix gives detailed variable definitions and sources. Heteroskedasticity-adjusted standard errors clustered at the country level are reported in parentheses below the estimates. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively. Corporate Control and Legal (Courts) Formalism</p>
        <p>The table associates corporate control and ownership concentration with an index of court (legal) formalism. Columns (1) to (3) report firm-level probit (maximum likelihood) estimates (average marginal effects). The dependent variable is an indicator that takes the value of one if a firm is controlled (by an individual/family, a private firm with an unmatched ultimate owner, the government, a widely held private firm, or a widely held public firm) and zero if the firm is widely held (with or without a block). For the identification of controlled corporations we use the 20% votingrights cutoff. Columns (4) to ( 6) report firm-level ordered probit (maximum likelihood) coefficients. The dependent variable is an ordered index of corporate control. The trichotomous index takes the value of zero for widely held firms without a block (all shareholders/families hold less than 5% of the firm's voting rights), one for widely held firms with at least one block (in excess of 5%), and two for firms with a controlling shareholder (of any type). Columns (7) to ( 9) report firm-level OLS estimates. The dependent variable is the C3 index of ownership concentration, which reflects the voting rights held by the three largest shareholders (treating family members as one representative shareholder with aggregated voting rights).</p>
        <p>The main explanatory variable (log days contract enforcement) describes the number of calendar days to enforce a contract of unpaid debt worth 50% of the country's GDP per capita as of January 2003. The variable comes from Djankov, McLiesh, and Shleifer (2007). The specifications in columns (1), (4), and (7) are estimated on the 2012 sample, the specifications in columns (2), (5), and ( 8) are estimated on the 2007 sample, and the specifications in columns (3), (6), and ( 9) are estimated on the pooled 2004 to 2012 sample that maximizes coverage (42,720 firms). All specifications include continental fixed effects (constants not reported) following the World Bank's regional classification, industry fixed effects using two-digit SIC classifications (85 sectors, constants not reported), and the logarithm of GDP per capita. The pooled specifications in the 2004 to 2012 sample also include year fixed effects (constants not reported). The table reports firm-level probit (maximum likelihood) estimates (average marginal effects) associating corporate control with proxies for entry regulation. The dependent variable is an indicator that takes the value of one if a firm is controlled (by an individual/family, a private firm with an unmatched ultimate owner, the government, a widely held private firm, or a widely held public firm) and zero when the firm is widely held (with or without a block). For the identification of controlled corporations we use the 20% voting-rights cutoff. The key explanatory variables capture red tape and barriers to entry in 2006. They reflect (i) the log of the number of calendar days required, or common in practice, for an entrepreneur to start up and formally operate an industrial or commercial business, (ii) the log of the number of administrative procedures required by an entrepreneur to start and operate a business, and (iii) the direct costs (as a fraction of GDP per capita) to start up and formally operate a business. These variables are retrieved from the World Bank's Doing Business database and are based on Djankov et al. (2002). The specifications in columns (1) to (3) are estimated on the 2012 sample, the specifications in columns (4) to (6) are estimated on the 2007 sample, and the specifications in columns ( 7) to ( 9) are estimated on the pooled 2004 to 2012 sample that maximizes coverage (42,720 firms). All specifications include continental fixed effects (constants not reported) following the World Bank's regional classification, industry fixed effects using two-digit SIC classifications (85 sectors, constants not reported), and the logarithm of GDP per capita.

        <p>For example, the government of Argentina is a shareholder of Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales, the government of China holds a large stake in PetroChina Company, and the government of India is a major shareholder of Coal India.</p>
        <p>For example, Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America, a trade association that provides life insurance and retirement annuities for people who work in the academic, research, medical, and cultural fields, is a shareholder of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, a company that provides office/laboratory and tech office space for lease.</p>

        <p>We do not include a Socialist law indicator, as by the mid-2000s Eastern European and Asian countries aligned with the Soviet Union had changed their legal systems(La Porta, Lopez-de Silanes, and Shleifer (2006)).</p>
        <p>The World Bank assigns countries to the following regions: Sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East and North Africa, East Asia and the Pacific, Western Europe, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and the Americas which includes North America (the US and Canada), Latin America, and the Caribbean.</p>
        <p>While different blockholders may take a more passive or active role in corporate affairs, we do not distinguish between blockholder type (e.g., individual/family, pension, mutual fund, or HF), as we do not have precise information on their strategy. Moreover, blockholders' rights, as specified in corporate law and securities legislation, differ across countries.</p>
        <p>We also run specifications dropping even more countries with many firm observations. Although the sample drops by more than 40%, we still find that ownership concentration in French civil-law countries is higher. However, the estimates are imprecise and do not always pass standard significance thresholds.</p>

Morck, Randall, Michael Percy, Gloria Tian, and Bernard Yeung, 2005 The table associates corporate control and ownership concentration with proxies for labor market regulation. Columns (1) to ( 3) report firm-level probit estimates (average marginal effects). The dependent variable is an indicator that takes the value of one if a firm is controlled and zero if the firm is widely held (with or without a block). For the identification of controlled corporations we use the 20% voting-rights cutoff. Columns ( 4) to ( 6) report firm-level ordered probit coefficients. The dependent variable is an ordered index of corporate control. The trichotomous index takes the value of zero for widely held firms without a block (all shareholders/families hold less than 5% of voting rights), one for widely held firms with at least one block (in excess of 5%), and two for firms with a controlling shareholder (of any type). Columns ( 7) to ( 9) report firm-level OLS estimates. The dependent variable is the C3 index of ownership concentration, which captures the voting rights of the three largest shareholders (treating family members as one representative shareholder with aggregated voting rights). The employment laws index, which ranges from 0 to 1, captures the following aspects of labor market legislation: (i) alternative employment contracts, (ii) cost of increasing hours worked, (iii) cost of firing workers, and (iv) dismissal procedures. The collective relations index, which ranges from 0 to 1, captures labor union power and collective disputes. The social security index, which ranges from 0 to 1, measures social security benefits. It is the average of (i) old age, disability, and death benefits, (ii) sickness and health benefits, and (iii) unemployment benefits. All variables are come from Botero et al. (2004). The specifications in columns (1), (4), and ( 7) are estimated on the 2012 sample. The specifications in columns (2), (5), and ( 8) are estimated on the 2007 sample, and the specifications in columns (3), (6), and (9) are estimated on the pooled 2004 to 2012 sample that maximizes coverage (42,720 firms). All specifications include continental fixed effects (constants not reported), industry fixed effects (constants not reported), and the logarithm of GDP per capita. The 2004 to 2012 sample specifications also include year fixed effects (constants not reported). The Data Appendix gives detailed variable definitions and sources. Heteroskedasticity-adjusted standard errors and clustered at the country level are reported in parentheses below the estimates. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.</p>
