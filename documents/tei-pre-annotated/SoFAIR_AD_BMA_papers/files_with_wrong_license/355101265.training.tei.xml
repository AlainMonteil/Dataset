        <p>How does competition affect market outcomes when formal contracts are not enforceable and parties' resort to relational contracts? Difficulties with measuring relational contracts and dealing with the endogeneity of competition have frustrated attempts to answer this question. We make progress by studying relational contracts between upstream farmers and downstream mills in Rwanda's coffee industry. First, we identify salient dimensions of their relational contracts and measure them through an original survey of mills and farmers. Second, we take advantage of an engineering model for the optimal placement of mills to construct an instrument that isolates geographically determined variation in competition. Conditional on the suitability for mills' placement within the catchment area, we find that mills surrounded by more suitable areas: (i) face more competition from other mills; (ii) use fewer relational contracts with farmers; and (iii) exhibit worse performance. An additional competing mill also (iv) reduces the aggregate quantity of coffee supplied to mills by farmers and (v) makes farmers worse off. Competition hampers relational contracts directly by increasing farmers' temptation to default on the relational contract and indirectly by reducing mill's profits. * This project was made possible by the collaboration of the Rwanda National Agricultural Exporting Board. Without implicating them, we are especially grateful to Alex Kanyankole, Celestin Gatarayiha and Eric Rukwaya. We owe special thanks to the editors, Pol Antras and Larry Katz and four anonymous referees for many comments and suggestions.How does competition affect market outcomes when formal contracts are not enforceable and parties' resort to relational contracts?

        <p>Markets in developing economies are often portrayed as dysfunctional: thin, scarcely competitive, and harboring unproductive firms. This suggests an important role for increased competition in improving firm performance and management via both selection and incentives (Syverson (2004), Bloom and Van Reenen (2010), Bloom et al. (2015)). Yet, these same markets are also often characterized by weak contract enforcement (Greif (1993), Djankov et al. (2003)). This generates an important role for relational contracts -informal agreements sustained by the future value of the relationship (Baker et al. (2002)). In settings with limited competition, but also weak contract enforcement, the effects of increased competition on firm performance are then theoretically ambiguous: on the one hand, competition might improve a firm's performance; on the other hand, by tempting parties with alternative trading opportunities and reducing profits, it may weaken relational contracting and reduce efficiency.Markets in developing economies are often portrayed as dysfunctional: thin, scarcely competitive, and harboring unproductive firms.

        <p>What is the impact of competition in such second-best institutional environments? Answering this question empirically has been challenging for two reasons: first, relational contracts are implicit and context-specific, making such contracts difficult to measure; second, identification of the causal effects of competition is complicated by the endogeneity of market structure. This article identifies the effect of increased competition on firm outcomes in a weakly institutionalized environment in which relational contracts are needed to sustain trade. We address the two challenges by studying relational contracts between upstream farmers and downstream mills in Rwanda's coffee industry, a context that affords us progress in both measurement and identification. 1The context allows us, first, to identify specific, salient dimensions of relational contracts. Mills operate a simple technology but, due to poorly functioning input and financial markets typical of agriculture in developing countries' (see, e.g., Bardhan (1989)), sourcing of coffee cherries from farmers at harvest is bundled with legally unenforceable provision of services before, during and after harvest. We measure the use of these relational contracts by conducting an original survey of both mills and farmers in the sector.What is the impact of competition in such second-best institutional environments?

        <p>Second, we construct an instrument for competition, building on an engineering model that specifies detailed criteria for the optimal placement of mills.

        <p>We also show that an additional competing mill (iv) makes farmers worse off; and (v) reduces the aggregate volume of coffee supplied by farmers to mills. We find that competition hampers relational contracts directly by tempting farmers to default on the relational contract and indirectly by reducing mill's profits. These findings must be interpreted cautiously. We identify the effect of an additional competitor for a mill that competes with six other mills on average. Our findings are thus not in conflict with Adam Smith's remark that "monopoly is a great enemy to good management". 2 The finding that increased competition downstream leaves all market participants -including upstream producers -no better off, however, provides novel evidence on the functioning of markets in second-best environments (Rodrik (2008)). In particular, it suggests the possibility of socially excessive entry when contracts are hard to enforce and a potential role for policy to improve efficiency.We also show that an additional competing mill (iv) makes farmers worse off; and (v) reduces the aggregate volume of coffee supplied by farmers to mills.

        <p>The article proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides industry background and presents our measure of relational contracts between mills and farmers. In our context a relational contract is a legally non-binding agreement between a mill and supplying farmers that describes how farmers and mills should behave over the course of the entire coffee season. We focus on three relational practices: inputs and loans provided by the mill to the farmers before harvest; coffee sold on credit by farmers to the mill during harvest; and assistance from the mill to the farmers unrelated to (that is, post) harvest. We measure the use of each relational practice surveying mills' managers and randomly sampled farmers. We aggregate the mill's manager and farmers' responses into a relational contracts index. The relational contracts index displays significant variation and correlates well with mills' performance, giving us confidence that it measures relevant practices for this industry.The article proceeds as follows.

The model isolates two distinct channels.</p>
        <p>First, there is a direct effect through which competition between mills increases farmers' temptation to renege on the relational contract. Second, competition reduces mills processed volumes and profits. This makes it harder to sustain relational contracts with farmers, even those for which the temptation to renege has not increased. We label this the indirect effect. Higher competition might reduce parties' ability to sustain a relational contract. When this occurs, the model delivers a cluster of additional predictions, including an aggregate reduction in cherries procured by mills and lower welfare for farmers.First, there is a direct effect through which competition between mills increases farmers' temptation to renege on the relational contract.

Section 4 asks whether competition breaks relational contracts; Section 5 explores the consequences of relational contracts breakdown; and Section 6 investigates the mechanisms.</p>
        <p>With regard to the role of competition in sustaining relational contracting, we begin by outlining stylized features of coffee production. Coffee cherries must be processed within hours of harvest and roads are often in poor conditions. Mills thus mainly compete with nearby mills. We measure competition as the number of mills within a 10 km radius from the mill and find that competition negatively correlates with the relational contract index. Ordinary least square (OLS) estimates, however, are likely biased: unobservable factors might correlate with competition and with the desirability, or the feasibility, of relational contracts; competitors might locate near mills with either worse or better relational practices; and competition could itself be measured with error.With regard to the role of competition in sustaining relational contracting, we begin by outlining stylized features of coffee production.

        <p>To address these concerns, we implement an instrumental variable strategy. We need a variable that, conditional on controls, correlates with competition (first stage) and only influences mill and farmers' operations through its effect on competition (exclusion restriction). We construct our instrument combining the spatial nature of competition with an engineering model for the optimal placement of mills in Rwanda.To address these concerns, we implement an instrumental variable strategy.

        <p>In the early 2000s, when only a handful of mills were established, a team of engineers and agronomists developed a model to identify suitable sites for mill construction.In the early 2000s, when only a handful of mills were established, a team of engineers and agronomists developed a model to identify suitable sites for mill construction.</p>
        <p>The model, however, was never implemented because the required GIS data were not available at the time. Subsequent entry of mills was thus not restricted to locations satisfying the model's criteria. We assembled ex-novo the data required for the model.The model, however, was never implemented because the required GIS data were not available at the time.

        <p>We predict actual mill placement with the model's criteria and other controls obtaining a "suitability score" for a mill's placement at the 1 km 2 resolution for the whole of Rwanda. For each mill we aggregate the suitability score in the area within 5 km radius (henceforth, the catchment area) and in the surrounding area between 5 and 10 km from the mill (henceforth, the instrument). The exclusion restriction is satisfied if, conditional on suitability within the mill's catchment area, suitability in the surrounding area affects mill and farmers' operation only through its impact on competition.We predict actual mill placement with the model's criteria and other controls obtaining a "suitability score" for a mill's placement at the 1 km 2 resolution for the whole of Rwanda.

        <p>The instrument yields a strong first stage and the second stage finds that an ad-ditional mill within 10 km reduces the relational contract index at the mill by 0.28 standard deviations, suggesting that competition has a negative impact on relational contracts. We discuss next extensive evidence mitigating concerns about violations of the exclusion restriction. First, presence of roads and local density of coffee trees are among the variables used to predict the suitability score at the 1 km 2 . These variables could potentially violate the exclusion restriction and be bad controls. We show that we can omit road density or coffee tree density or both from the construction of the instrument without altering the results. We can also omit those variables from the set of controls in the mill's catchment area without affecting our estimates. Second, our instrument could correlate with farmers' economic opportunities outside coffee, thus reducing the demand for relational contracts. We show that the instrument is uncorrelated with farmers' outside economic opportunities, including access to agricultural markets, to labor markets opportunities, and to financial services. 3The evidence in Section 4 suggests that competition leads to a breakdown in relational contracts between mills and farmers. When this happens the model yields a cluster of additional predictions. Section 5 tests these predictions and finds ample support. First, competition reduces relational practices before, during and after harvest by a nearly identical magnitude. Second, at the mill level, competition lowers the amount of cherries processed by the mill and leads to more irregular procurement of cherries. This results in higher average processing cost. We also detect a negative impact of competition on lab-tested quality of random samples of coffee produced by mills, particularly on quality dimensions that depend on farmers' practices. Third, at the farmer level, competition lowers the amount of coffee that farmers sell to any mill without increasing output nor prices. When farmers do not sell cherries to mills, they home process. Given the lower prices fetched by home-processed coffee, an additional mill reduces farmers revenues by about 8%.The instrument yields a strong first stage and the second stage finds that an ad-ditional mill within 10 km reduces the relational contract index at the mill by 0.28 standard deviations, suggesting that competition has a negative impact on relational contracts.

        <p>Finally, Section 6 investigates mechanisms. We provide evidence consistent with both mechanisms highlighted in the model being at work. Conditional on the number of competing mills and on the farmer's distance to the mill, the relational contract index is lower when the farmer is closer to competing mills. This is consistent with competition directly affecting the farmer's temptation to renege on the relational contract. We also show that, conditional on the number of competing mills to which the farmer can sell to, higher competition from mills to which the farmer cannot sell also reduces the relational contract index. This is consistent with competition indirectly affecting the relational contract through its negative impact on mill's performance. 4 Concluding remarks and policy implications are discussed in Section 7. This article contributes to three strands of literature. First, to the literature on relational contracts and, more broadly, on management practices (Bloom andVan Reenen (2007, 2010)). The work by Bloom andVan Reenen (2007, 2010) shows that the adoption of certain well-codified management practices is associated with better firm's performance. This raises the question of why many firms fail to adopt these management practices. A possibility is that a firm's ability to introduce, and benefit from, these practices depends on relational contracts both within and across the firm's boundaries (Baker et al. (2002), Gibbons and Henderson (2012), Helper and Henderson (2014)).Finally, Section 6 investigates mechanisms.

        <p>Relational practices are, by definition, hard to codify, context-specific and, therefore, hard to measure. This article provides an example of how relational practices can be systematically measured; documents significant dispersion in the adoption of complementary relational practices among firms competing in a narrowly defined industry; and confirms that their adoption correlates with firm performance. 5 Second, we study the effect of competition in an environment characterized by poor contract enforcement. 6 There is abundant evidence that competition is associated with higher productivity and better management practices. For example, Syverson (2004) shows that in the US larger, more competitive markets are associated with stronger selection in concrete manufacturing. Schmitz Jr. (2005) shows that, in response to competition from Brazilian producers, U.S. iron ore manufacturers increased efficiency and adjusted working arrangements (see also Bloom et al. (2015Bloom et al. ( , 2017) ) on competition and better management practices). In developing countries, Andrabi et al. (2017), Jensen and Miller (2018) show positive effects of competition on schools in Pakistan and boat builders in Kerala, India respectively. These papers study institutionally 4 The finding that an additional competitor reduces the aggregate volume of coffee supplied by farmers to mills distinguishes our mechanism from Mankiw and Whinston (1986). In Mankiw and Whinston (1986) an additional entrant increases the total quantity of the good sold in the market and makes consumers better off. Adapting the logic to our context, these predictions are inconsistent with our findings that competition reduces the aggregate quantity processed by mills and makes farmers worse off. Online Appendix D provides additional evidence on this point. 5 A growing literature studies relationships between firms, often in the context of international markets (see, e.g., Banerjee and Duflo (2000), Macchiavello (2010), Antras and Foley (2015), Macchiavello and Morjaria (2015b), Macchiavello and Miquel-Florensa (2019), Blouin and Macchiavello (2019), Startz (2018), Cajal et al. (2020)). This literature highlights how relationships mitigate contracting problems due to lack of enforcement and/or asymmetric information. We complement this agenda asking how competition affects the sustainability of these relationships.Relational practices are, by definition, hard to codify, context-specific and, therefore, hard to measure.

        <p>6 The question of how competition affects welfare has long been regarded as central to economics (see Schumpeter (1942), Stigler (1956), Arrow (1962)). developed environments or contexts in which relational contracts are not key. Our analysis suggests that the benefits of competition might be hampered by the presence of other market failures which are mitigated by relational contracts.6 The question of how competition affects welfare has long been regarded as central to economics (see Schumpeter (1942), Stigler (1956), Arrow (1962)). developed environments or contexts in which relational contracts are not key.

        <p>Third, the article relates to the literature on how competition affects relational lending and trade credit. Petersen and Rajan (1995) is a seminal article on how competition might be detrimental to relational lending. McMillan and Woodruff (1999) provides empirical evidence on how firms' outside options affect the ability to sustain relational agreements in a context characterized by weak contract enforcement. Fisman and Raturi (2004) find that monopoly power is negatively associated with credit provision, using data on supply relationships in five African countries. Our article differs from these contributions in several ways. First, we instrument for smoother changes in competition within an oligopolistic setting. Second, we study a context with two sided moral-hazard: both mills and farmers can cheat, just at different points during the harvest season. In contrast, the trade credit literature often considers one-sided moral hazard (suppliers offering trade credit to buyers) and thus when competition increases firms might compete extending trade credit. Ghani and Reed (2020) find evidence consistent with this mechanism exploiting the sudden entry of a new ice manufacturer in Sierra Leone. Casaburi and Reed (2020) find that traders that were randomly offered higher resale prices extended more credit to farmers. 7 2 Industry BackgroundThird, the article relates to the literature on how competition affects relational lending and trade credit.

        <p>Overview: Coffee is produced in about 50 countries around the world. Certain aspects of coffee cultivation, harvesting, processing and commercialization differ across countries. This section focuses on Rwanda's industry. At the time of our survey in 2012 there were around 350,000 smallholder farmers growing coffee, coffee accounted for almost 20% of the country's exports and between 12% to 15% of Rwanda's gross domestic product.Overview: Coffee is produced in about 50 countries around the world.

        <p>Upon harvest, the pulp of the coffee cherry is removed, leaving the bean which is then dried to obtain parchment coffee. There are two processing methods to obtain parchment coffee: the dry method and the wet method. In the dry method, farmers clean cherries at home using rocks before drying then on mats. This process produces coffee cherries of lower and less consistent quality. By contrast, cherries processed through the wet method are taken to a mill (often referred to as coffee washing stations or wet mills) within hours of harvest. If not taken immediately, the cherries will start to ferment and rot. Mills are therefore scattered around the countryside; farmers closest to the mill often take cherries to the mill's gate directly. Those who are further afield bring cherries to collection sites in which coffee collectors buy coffee.Upon harvest, the pulp of the coffee cherry is removed, leaving the bean which is then dried to obtain parchment coffee.

        <p>The wet method requires specific equipment and substantial quantities of clean water. After the cherry skin and pulp are removed with a pressing machine, cherries are sorted by immersion in water. The bean is then left to ferment for around 30 hours to remove the remaining skin. When fermentation is complete, the coffee is thoroughly washed with clean water. The beans are then spread out on drying tables and frequently turned by hand until completely and uniformly dry. 8The wet method requires specific equipment and substantial quantities of clean water.

        <p>The wet method yields significantly higher value addition for the Rwandan coffee chain as a whole. At the time of our survey, export gate prices for wet-processed coffee (known as fully washed coffee) were around 40% higher than for dry-processed coffee (see Macchiavello and Morjaria (2015a) for details). Selling cherries to mills also yields higher revenues at the farm gate. The average price of cherries sold to mill was about 200 Rwandan Francs (RWF) per kilogram. In contrast, home processed parchment coffee fetched an average price of 760 RWF per kilogram. Since it takes approximately 5.5 to 6.0 kilograms of cherries to produce one kilogram of home-processed parchment irrespective of the processing method, the price of cherries under home processing is approximately 140 RWF per kilogram, substantially lower than the corresponding figure for cherries sold to mills.The wet method yields significantly higher value addition for the Rwandan coffee chain as a whole.

        <p>The difference in prices underestimates the returns from selling cherries to mills for 8 After the drying process is completed the coffee is hulled and consolidated for exports. Hulled coffee is referred to as green coffee. This last step is carried out by separate plants (dry mills) located around the capital city.

As a result, farmers overwhelmingly report that selling cherries to mills is more profitable than home processing. For instance, when asked in our 2012 survey about which kind of buyer offers the highest price, only 2% of farmers answered traders buying home processed coffee. In a subsequent farmer survey in 2019 which also confirms the price difference, we asked farmers directly about the relative profitability of the two processing methods. Most of the farmers (98%) report that selling cherries to mills is more profitable than home processing.farmers since home-processed coffee entails additional processing costs for the farmers.

        <p>Why do farmers engage in home processing at all given its much lower returns relative to selling cherries to mills? In both the 2012 and 2019 surveys, farmers reported that they would sell home processed coffee after the harvest period when they were in need of cash, effectively treating this production as a very expensive savings tool. This observation raises the question: why are mills unable to buy cherries at harvest and defer farmers' payments to the post-harvest period?Why do farmers engage in home processing at all given its much lower returns relative to selling cherries to mills?

        <p>The average mill employs around 35 seasonal employees and sources from close to 400 smallholder farmers.

        <p>11 We only know the name of the farmer and the village where the farmer's plot is located. This would not per se be a major limitation given that the average village has an area just larger than 1 km 2 . Unfortunately, however, village names do not uniquely identify villages and respondents of different age and ethnicity often refer to the same village using different names. We thus look for each surveyed farmer in a de-anonymized version of the national census of coffee farmers to assign farmers to a village and, thus, location. We are able to precisely locate approximately 70% of our surveyed farmers. We are able to locate an additional 10% of farmers through a fuzzy match procedure and find similar results when including those in our analysis. All results in our main Tables of the article are robust if we restrict the analysis to this restricted sample of farmers.11 We only know the name of the farmer and the village where the farmer's plot is located.

        <p>The survey focused on different aspects of these transactions between mills and farmers. We refer to each aspect as a "practice". Given the lack of enforceable contracts in the rural areas of Rwanda, coffee farmers and mills must rely on informal relationships to sustain these transactions. We therefore refer to the set of practices between a mill and the supplying farmers as the relational contract.The survey focused on different aspects of these transactions between mills and farmers.

For each of these practices we asked both the farmers and the manager about their use at the mill.Table I presents summary statistics for the main relational practices.

        <p>Before harvest, the main aspect of the relational contract is whether the mill provides farmers with inputs, extension services, and pre-harvesting loans. Gains from such practices arise from the relevant markets being poorly functioning and/or from the mill's ability to more effectively organize procurement of those inputs in bulky purchases. This type of arrangement is commonly observed in agricultural chains in developing countries, particularly in those involving large buyers sourcing from smallholders (e.g., in contract farming). Due to lack of contract enforcement, it is often difficult for the mill to ensure that, at harvest time, farmers that received inputs and loans actually deliver to the mill. Approximately 20% (80%) of the farmers report to have received inputs (loans) from the mill (Table I, Panel B). The mill managers' survey yields similar figures (Table I, Panel A).Before harvest, the main aspect of the relational contract is whether the mill provides farmers with inputs, extension services, and pre-harvesting loans.

        <p>During harvest, the main aspect of the relational contract is whether cherries are sold on credit to the mill in exchange for part of the payment being made after the end of harvest, possibly in the form of so-called "second payment". This is beneficial for farmers and mills alike. As mentioned above, farmers report that a main motivation for home processing is to be able to sell coffee when they need cash rather than at harvest. Receiving part of the payments for cherries sold to mills during harvest as second payments paid after the end of harvest might thus help farmers overcome saving constraints. Mills might also benefit from purchasing cherries from farmers to reduce working capital requirements. 13 Due to the lack of contract enforcement, farmers might be concerned that after the end of harvest the mill might not be able, or willing, to pay the full balance still due to farmers for their deliveries. Since farmers would provide trade credit in-kind (in the form of coffee cherries), input diversion on the part of the mill is unlikely to be the key concern (Burkart and Ellingsen (2004)). Farmers, however, might be concerned that the mill would renege on promised second payments. In the 2019 farmer survey we asked farmers whether they are concerned about mills defaulting on second payments. Of farmers that reported second payments, a third reported having experienced defaults on second payments in the past.During harvest, the main aspect of the relational contract is whether cherries are sold on credit to the mill in exchange for part of the payment being made after the end of harvest, possibly in the form of so-called "second payment".

        <p>We asked managers whether the mill "has made second payments in the past" and farmers whether they "expect a second payment from the mill". The farmers' question captures the idea that, in relational contracting models, defaults occur offthe-equilibrium path. Concerns about default imply that promises of second payments might be constrained. On the extensive margin, the majority of managers and farmers report their use. Amounts typically are between 5% to 10% of total payments. Finally, as part of the relational contract, the mill and the farmers can also transact services that are not related to harvest operations. For instance, mills can help farmers with loans for bulky or unexpected expenses. Those might be related to coffee farming (e.g., help to cover the costs of replanting or mulching trees ) or not (e.g., assistance with school fees). Due to lack of contract enforcement it might be difficult for mills to ensure that farmers repay those loans. On the extensive margin, 64% of farmers expect to be able to access help from the mill in case of need while 77% of mills managers report to have occasionally helped farmers with loans. These qualitative dummies can be aggregated across the five surveyed farmers to measure how often farmers can rely on the mill for help/loans unrelated to harvest season. The provision of loans and inputs before harvest is also consistent with farmers' saving constraints ahead of the following harvest cycle.We asked managers whether the mill "has made second payments in the past" and farmers whether they "expect a second payment from the mill".

We ask both farmers and managers about the use of each of the three practices at the mill. After standardizing the responses, we construct indices for the intensity of the relationship before, during, and after harvest giving equal weight to the managers' response and the average of the farmers' responses.

        <p>There is significant dispersion in the adoption of relational practices. Figure I shows that the use of relational practices pre-harvest, at harvest and post-harvest are positively correlated across mills. The relational contract index thus captures a set of complementary relational practices.

        <p>This section lays out a theoretical framework that guides the empirical analysis. A mill interacts repeatedly with a population of farmers. In exchange for coffee cherries, the mill provides farmers with productivity-enhancing inputs and access to a saving tool through delayed payments. In the rural areas of developing countries, this type of intertemporal exchange is hard to enforce with formal contracts, and so the parties have to rely on relational contracts.This section lays out a theoretical framework that guides the empirical analysis.

        <p>The model establishes two sets of results. First, we provide conditions under which competition between mills reduces parties' ability to sustain the relational contract. We derive predictions on mill-and farmer-level outcomes under these conditions.

Second, we identify two distinct channels through which competition between mills affects relational contracts and we offer guidance on how to empirically disentangle them.</p>
        <p>The first channel, which we refer to as the direct effect, arises from the fact that after a farmer has already received productivity-enhancing inputs from a mill, she can choose to either deliver coffee cherries to that mill or sell them to an alternative mill. A larger number of competing mills makes this alternative more tempting, so that the original mill may be more reluctant to provide the farmer with productivity-enhancing inputs to begin with. The second channel, which we refer to as the indirect effect, arises from the fact that competition with other mills reduces a mill's profits. This will reduce the value of future rents, which are necessary to sustain the relational contract.The first channel, which we refer to as the direct effect, arises from the fact that after a farmer has already received productivity-enhancing inputs from a mill, she can choose to either deliver coffee cherries to that mill or sell them to an alternative mill.

        <p>The model focuses on the most salient relational practices in our context: second payments, input extension and farmers' side-selling behaviour. We model second payments' role in alleviating farmers' saving constraints and the difficulty in enforcing them as they are critical in our context and not well emphasized in the literature.The model focuses on the most salient relational practices in our context: second payments, input extension and farmers' side-selling behaviour.

        <p>Besides empirical relevance, modeling input extension allows us to rationalize its complementarity with second payments despite the absence of a technological connection between the two. Finally, modeling side-selling offers a convenient way to tie temptations to deviate in the relational contract to the degree of competition. 14We model competition as a parameter that affects spot prices at which farmers can sell during the harvest season. This provides a parsimonious approach that still captures the direct and indirect effects of competition that are key to our analysis.15Besides empirical relevance, modeling input extension allows us to rationalize its complementarity with second payments despite the absence of a technological connection between the two.

        <p>Players and Preferences: A risk-neutral mill operates in an area populated by a unit mass of farmers, indexed i ∈ [0, 1]. Time is represented by an infinite sequence of identical seasons, indexed t = 0, 1, 2..., ∞. Within each season, there are three sub-periods, corresponding to pre-harvest (sub-indexed by 0), harvest (sub-indexed by 1) and postharvest (sub-indexed by 2). Farmers derive utility from consumption at harvest, c 1 , and post-harvest, c 2 , with preferences given by u(c 1 , c 2 ) = min{c 1 , c 2 }. Consumption in each sub-period is equal to the sum of the transfer that the farmer receives from the mill and the revenue she earns from selling externally. These preferences capture farmers' demands for within-season consumption smoothing. The mill and the farmers have a common discount factor β &lt; 1 across seasons. There is no discounting within season. In any season, the mill continues operation with probability θ (later endogenized) and ceases to operate with probability (1 -θ). Denote δ = βθ.Players and Preferences: A risk-neutral mill operates in an area populated by a unit mass of farmers, indexed i ∈ [0, 1].

Within each season, there are three sub-periods, corresponding to pre-harvest (sub-indexed by 0), harvest (sub-indexed by 1) and postharvest (sub-indexed by 2). Farmers derive utility from consumption at harvest, c 1 , and post-harvest, c 2 , with preferences given by u(c 1 , c 2 ) = min{c 1 , c 2 }. Consumption in each sub-period is equal to the sum of the transfer that the farmer receives from the mill and the revenue she earns from selling externally. These preferences capture farmers' demands for within-season consumption smoothing. The mill and the farmers have a common discount factor β &lt; 1 across seasons. There is no discounting within season. In any season, the mill continues operation with probability θ (later endogenized) and ceases to operate with probability (1 -θ). Denote δ = βθ.</p>

        <p>Proposition 2 (Indirect Effect of Competition): Consider an increase in mill-level competition C induced by an expansion in the sets C i for a positive mass of farmers i ∈ R C ⊂ R.

        <p>First, higher competition C i can make the farmer worse off when it destroys a relational contract with I k i = 1. Since the side-selling constraint ( 2) is binding, the farmer's utility in a relational contract with I k i = 1 is strictly higher than the utility under no relational contract or in a relational contract with I k i = 0. Note that farmers can be worse off even when competition increases prices for cherries at harvest. Due to the lack of saving tools, a farmer cares about when she is paid, not only how much.First, higher competition C i can make the farmer worse off when it destroys a relational contract with I k i = 1.

        <p>Second, when the relational contract cannot be enforced there is no spot price at which farmers sell all their production as cherries at harvest. This is because the farmer has a demand for post-harvest income that spot market competition, no matter how intense, simply cannot meet. Hence, the quantity of cherries sold for processing at harvest declines at the farmer, at the mill and at the aggregate level. Given fixed costs and constant variable processing costs, the lower quantity processed by the mill also implies higher average cost.Second, when the relational contract cannot be enforced there is no spot price at which farmers sell all their production as cherries at harvest.

        <p>An extension of the model in which farmers also exert costly, non-contractible, effort yields that prices paid at harvest could also decrease due to competition. In such an extension, the price paid by the mill must compensate farmers for the effort and, if competition makes it impossible to sustain effort, observed prices paid by the mill might also decrease. The impact of competition on prices is thus ambiguous. In a similar vein, if the farmer's non-contractible effort increases the quality of the coffee, competition can lower the quality of coffee produced by the mills.An extension of the model in which farmers also exert costly, non-contractible, effort yields that prices paid at harvest could also decrease due to competition.

The reason we prefer our baseline approach is that mill's specific conditions might endogenously respond to both competition and to mill's practices.</p>
        <p>Mill specific measures of competition thus introduce additional sources of bias. The baseline measure avoids that. To the extent that the baseline measure suffers from measurement error, OLS results will be biased towards zero.

        <p>Column 1 of Table II shows that competition negatively correlates with relational contracts: an additional competing mill is correlated with a 0.116 standard deviation lower relational contract index. The OLS estimates, however, might be biased due to a number of concerns and cannot be interpreted as conclusive evidence of a negative impact of competition on relational contracts. For example, unobserved local conditions, such as farmers' skills or entrepreneurial attitude, might both be conducive to establish relational contracts and attract more competition in the area. In this case the OLS coefficient is upwardly biased. Conversely, better access to inputs and/or financial services could attract competition to the area but reduce farmers' demand for relational contracts. Potential entrants might also locate next to poorly run mills that score badly on relational contracts practices. In such cases, the OLS coefficient is biased downward. Furthermore, as noted above, the one-size-fits-all approach in our baseline measure of competition introduces measurement error which could bias the OLS estimate towards zero.Column 1 of Table II shows that competition negatively correlates with relational contracts: an additional competing mill is correlated with a 0.116 standard deviation lower relational contract index.

        <p>Given these concerns we turn to an IV strategy to investigate the causal impact of competition on relational contracts. The ideal instrument is a variable that, conditional on controls included in the model: (i ) strongly correlates with competition (the first stage), and (ii ) does not influence the use of relational contracts with farmers other than through its effect on competition (the exclusion restriction). To construct our instrument we combine (i ) the spatial nature of competition embedded in the notion of catchment area defined above with (ii ) drivers of suitability for mill placement (henceforth, "suitability"). Conditional on suitability within the mill's catchment area, competition is instrumented with suitability in the adjacent area around the mill's catchment area. Given our baseline definition of catchment area, the instrument for competition is then given by suitability for mill placement between 5 and 10 km radius from the mill, conditional on suitability (and other controls) within the 5 km radius catchment area.Given these concerns we turn to an IV strategy to investigate the causal impact of competition on relational contracts.

        <p>We build on an engineering model to construct our measure of suitability. In the early 2000s, when only a handful of mills were operating in Rwanda, a program coordinated by USAID involving engineers, agronomists and GIS specialists developed an engineering model for the optimal placement of mills in Rwanda (see, Schilling and McConnell (2004)). Given the particularly rugged nature of Rwanda, the model intended to identify suitable sites for mill construction at a high spatial resolution taking into account a vector of characteristics to be then aggregated into a "suitability score". The model, however, was never fully implemented because the required GIS data were not readily available for the whole of Rwanda at the time. Subsequent entry of mills was thus not restricted nor limited to locations satisfying the engineering model's criteria. We assembled all the data required ex-novo and are thus able to implement the engineering model for the first time. Using remote sensing and GIS tools on ortho-photos at the 25 m 2 resolution we run the engineering model for the whole of Rwanda at a resolution of 1 km 2 .We build on an engineering model to construct our measure of suitability.

        <p>We build on the engineering model and construct our instrument as follows. There are thousands of potential grids where mills could have entered and 214 in which a mill had entered by 2012. All mills that have entered satisfy criteria 1 and 2.

        <p>Within the sample of grids satisfying criteria 1 and 2 we run a probit model to predict mill entry. The probit model includes dummies for the remaining criteria 3 and 4, their interaction, and additional controls (polynomials in distances to springs and roads, average elevation and slope in the grid, longitude and latitude of the grid box centroid, density of coffee trees in the grid box, size of the sector and interactions of these variables).Within the sample of grids satisfying criteria 1 and 2 we run a probit model to predict mill entry.

        <p>The probit model lends support to the engineering model.

Finally, we aggregate the predicted suitability scores at the mill level. The average suitability score in the grids within a 5 km radius from the mill gives us a control for suitability in the mill's catchment area. Our instrument is the average suitability score within the area of 5 to 10 kms radius from the mill, akin to a cross-section surface of a donut.The probit model lends support to the engineering model.

        <p>The engineering model criteria and the controls raise a number of concerns about the identification strategy. First, coffee trees and roads inside the catchment area could be endogenous. This could generate a "bad control" problem. Second, conditional on these controls, trees and roads outside the mill catchment area could influence mill and farmers inside the catchment areas through channels other than competition (a violation of the exclusion restriction). We first present our main result and then present robustness checks that address these threats to our identification strategy and also explore robustness of our results along other dimensions.The engineering model criteria and the controls raise a number of concerns about the identification strategy.

An additional mill within a 10 km radius from the mill causes a reduction of 0.283 standard deviations in the relational contract index. The effect is economically sizeable. The comparison between the IV estimates in column 4 and the OLS estimates in column 1 reveals that the IV estimates are more than twice as large as the OLS (-0.116 vs -0.283). This is consistent with either measurement error or with the source of bias in the OLS being the presence of unobserved features that correlate with both entry of competitors and with the use of relational contracts.where S Column 4 in Table II reports the 2SLS estimates.

        <p>The specification assumes a linear effect of the number of competing mills on the relational contract index. In the model the relationship might be non-linear: relational contracts break down only when there is competition beyond a certain threshold. Aggregating over mills with heterogeneous threshold we expect the negative effect of competition to become stronger as competition intensifies, at least up to a certain point. Online Appendix Figure C8 explores the functional form of the relationship between competition and relational contracts reporting results from non-parametric IV estimation. The estimates indeed exhibit a decreasing and concave relationship between relational contracts and competition over the entire range of observed competition levels. The slope is relatively flatter for competition from fewer than 4 mills and then becomes steeper once competition intensifies. This pattern is consistent with the predictions of the model in Section 3.The specification assumes a linear effect of the number of competing mills on the relational contract index.

        <p>We now discuss threats to the identification strategy. First, we consider the role of both the presence of roads and tree density as ingredients of the instrument as well as their potential role as bad controls. We then consider several mechanisms that could lead to a violation of our exclusion restrictions. Online Appendix D further explores robustness along other dimensions, including the definitions of competition and catchment areas and other potential threats to the identification strategy.We now discuss threats to the identification strategy.

        <p>The logic of the identification strategy is that, conditional on road access and coffee tree density inside the mill's catchment area, roads and coffee tree density in the donut area do not directly affect farmers and mills. The logic is potentially undermined by two distinct sets of concerns. First, coffee tree density levels and road access outside the catchment area could affect mills and farmers directly. For example, a road in the donut area could still be used by the mill or by farmers; prices for home processed coffee might depend on harvest levels in the donut area through general equilibrium effects, and so on. If that is the case, the exclusion restriction is violated. Second, if road construction and coffee tree density in the catchment area respond to mills' operations, conditioning on these variables in the catchment area could induce a bad control problem.The logic of the identification strategy is that, conditional on road access and coffee tree density inside the mill's catchment area, roads and coffee tree density in the donut area do not directly affect farmers and mills.

        <p>Table B3 in the Online Appendix investigates the robustness of our baseline results to these concerns. Column (1) reports, for ease of comparison, our baseline specification. Columns (2) and (3) considers road presence. Column (2) removes roads from the IV, that is, from the engineering model used to predict the suitability score inside the donut area. This addresses the concern about the violation of the exclusion restriction, but not concerns about roads being a bad control. Column (3) thus goes one step forward and removes roads from the construction of the IV and the suitability score inside the catchment area, as well as a control. In both cases, results are robust: both the first stage (reported in Panel B) and the second stage (Panel A) remain highly statistically significant and has a similar magnitude as the baseline in column (1).Table B3 in the Online Appendix investigates the robustness of our baseline results to these concerns.

        <p>Columns (4) through (8) consider coffee trees. First, the second criteria of the engineering model restricts the sample of suitable grids to those in sectors (administrative unit of Rwanda) with the presence of a least 30,000 coffee trees. Column (4) replaces this criterion in the entry model presented in the Online Appendix Table B2 with a restriction requiring that the grid has a suitability for coffee cultivation (from FAO-GAEZ) equivalent to at least 460 tonnes per hectare.

        <p>Column (5) removes tree density from the construction of the instrument. Analogously to column (2) for roads, this is meant to address concerns about violations of the exclusion restriction.

Results are again essentially unchanged. We interpret the similarity between the baseline specification in column (1) and the results in columns ( 2) and ( 5) in the spirit of an over-identification test: as our instrument relies on multiple sources of variation, we can construct alternative instruments exploiting only subsets of these sources and obtain similar results.Column (5) removes tree density from the construction of the instrument.

        <p>Column (6) further removes tree density as a control and from the construction of the suitability score inside the catchment area. The magnitude of the second stage point estimate drops by about a third (from -0.283 to -0.182).

        <p>While tree density in the mill's catchment area might respond to the mill's entry and operations and thus can be a potential "bad control", it seems a priori important to control for it. For example, the same level of competition could have different impacts on the mill depending on how much coffee is grown in the region around the mill. To this end, FAO-GAEZ suitability for coffee cultivation is not a sufficiently precise control for two reasons: (i ) it is defined at a much higher level of aggregation (at the 9 km 2 resolution) than our analysis and is thus weakly related to variation in local conditions; (ii ) there are places that are suitable for coffee cultivation but are occupied by other economic activities (e.g., urban developments, conservation zones and mines). Columns ( 7) and ( 8), therefore, repeats the exercise computing coffee tree density using the National Coffee Census conducted in 1999; at that time, only two mills had been built in Rwanda. Tree density in 1999 is thus not the result of subsequent mill entry by the time of the survey in 2012. Although changes in administrative boundaries introduce measurement error, this strategy nearly halves (from -0.182 to -0.224) the gap in the point estimate relative to the baseline (-0.283).While tree density in the mill's catchment area might respond to the mill's entry and operations and thus can be a potential "bad control", it seems a priori important to control for it.

        <p>Although the results are robust to the exclusion of roads and coffee tree density from the instrument, it is still possible that suitability for mill entry in the donut area around the mill catchment area affects farmers' and mills' operation through channels other than competition for coffee. For instance, the instrument could correlate with better access to, or wages in, work outside the coffee sector; access to alternative saving or other financial services beyond the mill; and convenience of, or price available for, postharvest sales of home-processed coffee or other crops. In all these cases, the demand for interlinked transactions with the mill is lower for reasons unrelated to competition between mills.Although the results are robust to the exclusion of roads and coffee tree density from the instrument, it is still possible that suitability for mill entry in the donut area around the mill catchment area affects farmers' and mills' operation through channels other than competition for coffee.

        <p>The model implies that relational practices might be complementary. Competition alters only farmers' ability to sell cherries at harvest to a competing mill.

        <p>Columns 1 to 3 ask whether competition reduces relational practices in which the mill provides inputs and loans to farmers before harvest. Regardless of whether we ask farmers or managers, competition causes a reduction in use of this practice.

        <p>The model focuses on relational practices for which lack of contract enforcement matters, i.e., those in which the mill and the farmer exchange non-enforceable promises across several weeks. In contrast, we expect lack of contract enforcement to be less of a concern for exchange of promises over very short periods. We consider short-term credit and advances during harvest, two practices driven by liquidity considerations and that are not part of the relational contract between the mill and the farmer. Results in column (13) confirm that competition does not impact this type of short-term credit between the mill and the farmers.The model focuses on relational practices for which lack of contract enforcement matters, i.e., those in which the mill and the farmer exchange non-enforceable promises across several weeks.

        <p>Operating Costs: The model predicts that a breakdown in the relational contract with farmers is associated with changes in mill's outcomes. Table IV investigates these predictions. Column 1 shows that unit costs of processing 1 kilo of the output increases by 4.6% with an additional competing mill. Columns 2 and 3 show no effect on prices for cherries paid to farmers during harvest nor on the price for home processed parchment in the area, as reported by the mill manager. Column 4 presents a placebo: competition has no effect on the conversion ratio from coffee cherries to processed parchment, a parameter of the production function. The combination of columns 2 and 4 implies that competition has no effect on the cost of cherries. The cost of cherries accounts for about 60% of the overall unit costs of output production at the typical mill. The coefficient in column 1 must thus be explained by increases in other operating costs. Accordingly, column 5 shows that an additional competing mill increases processing unit costs by approximately 7%.Operating Costs: The model predicts that a breakdown in the relational contract with farmers is associated with changes in mill's outcomes.

        <p>Column 6 shows that competition reduces the total volume of coffee cherries processed by the mill. An additional competing mill is associated with approximately 5 fewer tons of processed cherries. This translates into 7.5% lower capacity utilization, a sizeble effect given that the average capacity utilization in the industry is around 50%.Column 6 shows that competition reduces the total volume of coffee cherries processed by the mill.

        <p>The breakdown in relational contracts with farmers makes deliveries harder to plan for. Column 7 shows that competition does not affect the number of weeks the mill is in operation during the harvest.

        <p>27 Labor costs increase as mills do not perfectly adjust labor to irregular deliveries. While 65% of mills revise employment plans weekly depending on cherry procurement and market conditions, arrangements between mills and workers also include elements of relational contracting. The majority of seasonal workers is paid weekly, bi-weekly or monthly, rather than daily. Firms thus do not turn down workers when there are not enough cherries to process. For example, 73% (12%) of mill managers report that they would turn down only some (none) of the workers if there were few cherries to process. Mills are located in densely populated rural areas with few employment opportunities and so competition has no impact on wage rates nor on the manager reporting difficulties in hiring workers.27 Labor costs increase as mills do not perfectly adjust labor to irregular deliveries.

        <p>an additional mill increases unit labor costs by nearly 11%. 28Product Quality: The model also predicts that when relational contracts breakdown, the quality of the coffee produced by the mill suffers. This happens because the mill does not provide inputs to farmers and farmers might not exert appropriate effort. In particular, farmers harvest less frequently and end up mixing cherries that are ripe with others that are either too ripe or not ready yet to be processed.an additional mill increases unit labor costs by nearly 11%. 28Product Quality: The model also predicts that when relational contracts breakdown, the quality of the coffee produced by the mill suffers.

        <p>To test this prediction we collected random samples of processed coffee from each mill. Each sample was inspected and "cupped" at the national coffee board's laboratory in Kigali. The cupping process scores each sample along several dimensions of quality related to both physical characteristics of the processed coffee (parchment) as well as defects that emerge following the roasting process. Physical characteristics and defects can be classified depending on their most likely origin: plant genetics, farmer's husbandry practices and mill processing.To test this prediction we collected random samples of processed coffee from each mill.

        <p>Table V presents the results. Column 1 shows that competition decreases the overall quality score of coffee processed by the mill. An additional competing mill reduces the quality score by 0.15 standard deviations. Columns 2 to 4 separate the quality score into different quality components depending on whether they are mostly under the control of the farmer (column 2), mill (column 3) or are genetically predetermined (column 4). We construct an index that captures aspects of quality that are under the direct control of farmers. The index aggregates two dimensions of quality: parchment bean size and pest damages. Given planted variety, smaller bean size is a consequence of poor harvesting practices. Severe insect and pest damages arise from inadequate use of insecticides at the farmer level. Column 2 shows that an additional competing mill decreases the index of farmer-related quality by 0.172 standard deviations.Table V presents the results.

        <p>The model predicts that a breakdown in the relational contract with the mill is associated with the following changes in farmer-level outcomes: (i ) an ambiguous effect on prices paid to farmers, (ii ) a drop in the share of cherries sold to mills (since farmers cannot rely on the mill's second payments to smooth cash flows), (iii ) a reduction in access to inputs, and, finally, (iv ) lower revenue and welfare.The model predicts that a breakdown in the relational contract with the mill is associated with the following changes in farmer-level outcomes: (i ) an ambiguous effect on prices paid to farmers, (ii ) a drop in the share of cherries sold to mills (since farmers cannot rely on the mill's second payments to smooth cash flows), (iii ) a reduction in access to inputs, and, finally, (iv ) lower revenue and welfare.</p>
        <p>Table VI tests these predictions with farmer-level specifications. Column 1 confirms the finding of column 2 in Table IV: competition has at best a small effect on prices received by farmers. While the detected effect is positive and statistically different from zero, it is very small. An additional mill increases prices reported by farmers by around 1%. Note that this is the price farmers report for sales of cherries during harvest. Since competition reduces second payments after the end of harvest, this estimate provides an upper bound to the effect of competition on the net-presentvalue of payments to farmers. Furthermore, column 2 shows that competition between mills does not change prices received for home processed parchment coffee. This result, in line with column 3 of Table IV, confirms that the impact of competition on prices received by farmers is negligible and supports our approach to model the price of home processed parchment as an exogenous parameter. 30 Column 3 shows that competition reduces the share of a farmer's production sold as cherries to any mill during harvest. That is, competition between mills actually increases the share of coffee that is home-processed. Column 4 finds that competition increases the likelihood that farmers report saving as the main motivation for processing coffee at home rather than selling cherries at harvest to the mill. Taken together, these two results confirm the key mechanism in the model: due to saving constraints, farmers have an unmet demand to receive part of their coffee income after harvest.Table VI tests these predictions with farmer-level specifications.

        <p>Competition destroys the relational contract between the farmer and the mill, in particular the mill's ability to credibly promise payments after the harvest. Farmers are then forced to process part of their coffee at home in order to save income until after harvest. 31 Column 5 shows that competition increases the likelihood that farmers have to robustness checks performed in Table B3 and to the alternative measure of competition in Table B8. 30 Since competition reduces quality, we might potentially underestimate the quality-adjusted price received by farmers. We think this is unlikely because mills did not pay farmers based on quality. Limited quality price premia at the farm-gate are not specific to our context (see e.g., Minten et al. (2018) for Ethiopia, Macchiavello and Miquel-Florensa (2019) for Colombia, Morjaria and Sprott (2018) for Uganda). 31 The results show that the aggregate amount of cherries sold by farmers to mills decreases as a result of competition. We discuss this further at the end of Section 6 and in the Online Appendix B self-finance inputs without an increase in yield (measured as kgs of cherries per coffee tree, column 6) nor an increase in overall input usage (measured as RWF spent per kg of cherries, column 7). Column 8 also shows that competition does not lead farmers to invest in their plantation and increase the number of coffee trees. 32 The lack of an effect of competition on prices, yields and input usage suggests that competition does not increase farmers' returns from coffee cultivation. It is notoriously difficult to measure profits for farming enterprises. 33 We nevertheless compute overall revenues from coffee cultivation adding reported sales of home parchment and cherries sold to mills. Column 9 finds that competition reduces revenues by 8% (p-value &lt;0.10). This is due to no change in overall production, a higher share sold as home processed parchment coffee, and the lower prices fetched by home processed coffee.Competition destroys the relational contract between the farmer and the mill, in particular the mill's ability to credibly promise payments after the harvest.

        <p>The estimated impact on revenues likely understates the negative impact on farmers profits and welfare since (i ) holding prices constant, farmers have to save through a very costly mechanism (home processing); (ii ) farmers incur higher costs in order to home process coffee.The estimated impact on revenues likely understates the negative impact on farmers profits and welfare since (i ) holding prices constant, farmers have to save through a very costly mechanism (home processing); (ii ) farmers incur higher costs in order to home process coffee.</p>
        <p>Given difficulties in measuring revenues and profits, we also consider the effect of competition on an overall index of job satisfaction as our preferred proxy for farmers' welfare. Column 10 in Table VI shows that competition has a strong negative impact on farmers' overall reported satisfaction. Columns ( 11), ( 12) and ( 13) open up the job satisfaction index and finds that competition lowers the likelihood that the farmer reports that the pay from the coffee business is good, further supporting our results on income.

        <p>33 These difficulties are particularly pronounced in our context as (i) farmers' have low literacy levels; (ii) coffee cultivation coexists alongside several other farming and non-farming activities; (iii) we implemented our survey before the end of the harvest season; (iv) the length of the farmer survey we could implement at the mill was severely constrained. 34 In the Online Appendix columns (7) to (12) of Table B6 shows that the main farmer level results are robust to controlling for market access.

        <p>Table VII untangles the two mechanisms. The intuition is as follows. Holding constant mill-level competition and farmer's distance to the mill, the nearest is the farmer to competing mills, the higher is the farmer's outside option. We thus expect that proximity to competing mills is correlated with a lower relational contracting index between the mill and the farmer. To explore this hypothesis, we need to compute distances between each farmer and all mills. We are able to do so for 70% of the surveyed farmers (see footnote 11).Table VII untangles the two mechanisms. The intuition is as follows.

        <p>Analogously to Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016), mill access is constructed as the inverse of the sum of the distance to the nearest and second nearest competing mills to the farmer. 35 We find that, conditional on mill-level competition, a farmer's proximity to competing mills is correlated with a lower relational contract index.Analogously to Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016), mill access is constructed as the inverse of the sum of the distance to the nearest and second nearest competing mills to the farmer. 35 We find that, conditional on mill-level competition, a farmer's proximity to competing mills is correlated with a lower relational contract index.</p>

To do so, we would like to construct an instrument for the suitability of mills in a donut area around the farmer.

This is the effect of competition operating through both the direct temptation and the indirect profit mechanisms. An additional mill in other quadrants reduces the relational contract index by 0.223 standard deviations. This is the impact due to the indirect profit mechanism only. The difference between the two estimates, 0.119 standard deviations (p-value 0.09) isolates the direct temptation mechanism.We find evidence that both mechanisms are at play.

        <p>In industries with fixed costs and in which an additional entrant lowers output of incumbent firms (business stealing), average costs increase and entry is more desirable to the entrant than to the industry as a whole (Mankiw and Whinston (1986)). While this mechanism is similar to the indirect effect in our model, the two can be empirically distinguished. In our model, an additional entrant makes it harder to sustain relational contracts for rivals, leading to a knock-on effect in which other relational contracts break down and aggregate amounts of cherries supplied to mills declines. In our context, instead, the model in Mankiw and Whinston (1986) would imply that an additional entrant raises the aggregate amount of cherries processed by mills (and increases the price paid to farmers). This prediction is inconsistent with evidence that an additional competitor lowers the volume of cherries supplied by farmers to all mills (Table 6,Column 3). In the Online Appendix D we also show that (1 ) there is great abundance of coffee cherries to be processed and thus business stealing effects alone are unlikely to drive mill-level outcomes (see Online Appendix Figure D2); (2 ) our instrument for competition displays an inverted-U shaped relationship with the aggregate amount of cherries processed (see Panel B, Online Appendix Figure D3): as predicted by our model, past a certain level of entry, aggregate volumes processed decline with further entry.In industries with fixed costs and in which an additional entrant lowers output of incumbent firms (business stealing), average costs increase and entry is more desirable to the entrant than to the industry as a whole (Mankiw and Whinston (1986)).

        <p>In settings where formal contracting institutions are poor, parties rely on relational contracts -informal agreements sustained by the future value of the relationship -to deter short-term opportunism and facilitate trade. Empirical evidence on the scope, structure and determinants of these informal arrangements has the potential to identify key market failures and inform policy, particularly in developing economies.In settings where formal contracting institutions are poor, parties rely on relational contracts -informal agreements sustained by the future value of the relationship -to deter short-term opportunism and facilitate trade.

        <p>This article presents an empirical study of the effect of competition on the relational contracts between coffee mills and farmers in Rwanda, a context that is of intrinsic interest but is also convenient from a methodological point of view. We make two contributions. First, we contribute to the literature on relational contracts and, more broadly, on management practices. We systematically measure relational practices in a sample of large firms; we document significant dispersion in the adoption of these practices; we show these practices are complementary; and confirm that their adoption is strongly correlated with firm's performance. Relational practices are, by definition, hard to codify and context-specific. While the practices we measure are relevant in our setting and in other agricultural value chains in developing countries, we hope to offer an example of the value to measure relational contracts in other contexts as well.This article presents an empirical study of the effect of competition on the relational contracts between coffee mills and farmers in Rwanda, a context that is of intrinsic interest but is also convenient from a methodological point of view.

        <p>Second, we study the role of competition as a determinant of the adoption of relational practices. We argue this is the key comparative static to understand whether poor contract enforcement alters market functioning. In a first-best world, we expect competition to have a positive effect on management quality and productivity. A dis-tinctive feature of relational contracts is that rents are relied upon to curb opportunism and, to the extent competition erodes those rents, it could lead to worse outcomes. We find a significant negative impact of competition between mills on the use of relational contracts between mills and farmers. The breakdown in relational contracts lowers mills' efficiency and output quality. More surprisingly, competition between mills lowers the aggregate amount of coffee supplied by farmers to any mill and, if anything, makes farmers worse off. This provides novel evidence on the functioning of markets in second-best environments.Second, we study the role of competition as a determinant of the adoption of relational practices.

        <p>These findings must be interpreted cautiously. Our results demonstrate that in a second-best world the benefits of competition might be hampered by the presence of other market failures which are mitigated by relational contracts: the design of adequate industrial policies needs to take into account informal arrangements and market institutions operating in specific contexts. Our analysis identifies the average effect of adding an additional competitor for a mill that is already subject to intense competition. The results should therefore not be interpreted as supporting monopsony.These findings must be interpreted cautiously.

        <p>The evidence suggests the possibility of excessive entry when contracts are hard to enforce. A direct policy recommendation, then, is to improve contract enforcement in agricultural chains. While it might be too much of a task to improve a country's formal court system, industry regulators can improve contract enforcement in specific agricultural chains. 37 Such policy interventions, however, must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis since partial improvements in contract enforcement could undermine relationships and worsen market functioning (Baker et al. (1994)).The evidence suggests the possibility of excessive entry when contracts are hard to enforce. A direct policy recommendation, then, is to improve contract enforcement in agricultural chains.

        <p>The industry in this article harbours (too) many unproductive firms -a rather typical portray of markets in developing economies. In such contexts, processes of consolidation (e.g., ownership changes through mergers and acquisitions) can potentially reduce inefficiencies but are often stifled by dysfunctional institutional environments. Indeed, in our context, such a process has started to emerge in recent years as more productive and better managed foreign exporters have acquired mills to integrate backwards (see Macchiavello and Morjaria ( 2020)).The industry in this article harbours (too) many unproductive firms -a rather typical portray of markets in developing economies.

        <p>Table B3: Robustness to IV: Exclusion Restriction and Bad Controls The dependent variable across all the specification is the relational contract index (z-score). Column 1 is the baseline specification using the engineering model (Table B2, column 4). "Instrument Score, 5-10km" refers to the instrumental variable, the average suitability z-score in the donut area. "Entry Model" refers to the engineering model, specifically that mill placement should take place in sectors with at least 30,000 coffee trees. "Catchment Area Score, 0-5km" refers to the average suitability z-score in the catchment area of the mill. This robustness table drops various criterion of the engineering model (Table B2 and geographic controls in Panel A and B in comparison to the baseline specification (column 1). In column 2, the presence of roads is removed in the engineering model when constructing the instrument; that is, there are no roads in the construction of the suitability score in the donut area. In column 3, in addition to removing roads in the instrument (column 2), roads are also removed from the engineering model when constructing the suitability score for the catchment area. Further, roads are also excluded from geographical controls. In columns 1 to 3, coffee trees are extracted from the 2009 National Coffee Census. Each sector must have at least 30,000 coffee trees in order for the 1 km 2 grid boxes to have a positive score. Columns 4 to 9 systematically change how the presence of coffee trees enters the engineering model criterion, construction of the suitability score for the instrument and the catchment area as well as geographical controls. In column 4, we replace the 30,000 coffee tree restriction with the FAO-GAEZ coffee suitability measure (referred to as "FAO Coffee" in the table) while the rest of the specification remains the same as our baseline. In column 5, in addition to using the FAO-GAEZ coffee suitability (in lieu of actual coffee trees) as the criterion, trees are excluded in constructing the instrument (i.e. suitability score in the donut area). In column 6, in addition to the column 5 modification we also exclude tree density from geographical controls, leaving only the FAO-GAEZ suitability in the engineering criteria. Actual coffee trees are no longer included in the instrument; similarly, the catchment score is not included in the geographical controls. In column 7, actual coffee trees are used again but this time extracted from a period before the industry took off, the 1999 National Coffee Census. Trees from the 1999 census are used to construct the instrument (i.e. suitability in the donut area). In the entry model criterion we use the FAO-GAEZ coffee suitability. In the catchment suitability score and geographical controls actual trees from the 2009 National Coffee Census are used. In column 8, the engineering model estimation uses FAO-GAEZ coffee suitability instead of the 30,000 coffee trees criterion and coffee trees are derived from the 1999 National Coffee Census in the instrument, catchment suitability score and geographic controls. In column 9, we run a similar specification to column 5 but we exclude both roads and trees to construct the instrument. In column 10, we run the same specification as our baseline in column 1 except the engineering model is an OLS rather than a probit model; negative predictions censored to 0 and predictions above the 95 th percentile have been winsorized. Centered R 2 is provided for Panel A (IV). 5) and ( 6) are from the 2009 National Coffee Census of all coffee farmers. Panel A shows the raw correlation between farmer outcomes and our competition instrument (Score within 5-10 km of the mill), controlling for the engineering suitability score within the catchment area (5 km).Table B3: Robustness to IV: Exclusion Restriction and Bad Controls The dependent variable across all the specification is the relational contract index (z-score). Column 1 is the baseline specification using the engineering model (Table B2, column 4). "Instrument Score, 5-10km" refers to the instrumental variable, the average suitability z-score in the donut area. "Entry Model" refers to the engineering model, specifically that mill placement should take place in sectors with at least 30,000 coffee trees. "Catchment Area Score, 0-5km" refers to the average suitability z-score in the catchment area of the mill. This robustness table drops various criterion of the engineering model (Table B2 and geographic controls in Panel A and B in comparison to the baseline specification (column 1). In column 2, the presence of roads is removed in the engineering model when constructing the instrument; that is, there are no roads in the construction of the suitability score in the donut area. In column 3, in addition to removing roads in the instrument (column 2), roads are also removed from the engineering model when constructing the suitability score for the catchment area. Further, roads are also excluded from geographical controls. In columns 1 to 3, coffee trees are extracted from the 2009 National Coffee Census. Each sector must have at least 30,000 coffee trees in order for the 1 km 2 grid boxes to have a positive score. Columns 4 to 9 systematically change how the presence of coffee trees enters the engineering model criterion, construction of the suitability score for the instrument and the catchment area as well as geographical controls. In column 4, we replace the 30,000 coffee tree restriction with the FAO-GAEZ coffee suitability measure (referred to as "FAO Coffee" in the table) while the rest of the specification remains the same as our baseline. In column 5, in addition to using the FAO-GAEZ coffee suitability (in lieu of actual coffee trees) as the criterion, trees are excluded in constructing the instrument (i.e. suitability score in the donut area). In column 6, in addition to the column 5 modification we also exclude tree density from geographical controls, leaving only the FAO-GAEZ suitability in the engineering criteria. Actual coffee trees are no longer included in the instrument; similarly, the catchment score is not included in the geographical controls. In column 7, actual coffee trees are used again but this time extracted from a period before the industry took off, the 1999 National Coffee Census. Trees from the 1999 census are used to construct the instrument (i.e. suitability in the donut area). In the entry model criterion we use the FAO-GAEZ coffee suitability. In the catchment suitability score and geographical controls actual trees from the 2009 National Coffee Census are used. In column 8, the engineering model estimation uses FAO-GAEZ coffee suitability instead of the 30,000 coffee trees criterion and coffee trees are derived from the 1999 National Coffee Census in the instrument, catchment suitability score and geographic controls. In column 9, we run a similar specification to column 5 but we exclude both roads and trees to construct the instrument. In column 10, we run the same specification as our baseline in column 1 except the engineering model is an OLS rather than a probit model; negative predictions censored to 0 and predictions above the 95 th percentile have been winsorized.

Prior to harvest, the mill decides whether to provide inputs to farmers or not. Farmers then decide whether to exert effort. At harvest, production is realized. The farmer decides whether to sell to the mill or to home process the coffee. If the farmer home processes the coffee, she decides how much to sell for current consumption and how much to store until post-harvest.

        <p>Our instrument relies on cross-sectional variation in suitability for mill entry. It is therefore important to consider whether dynamic entry considerations might invalidate the identification strategy. The main threat to the identification strategy is posed by the possibility that certain mills strategically locate in areas with high coffee suitability but that are surrounded by areas with low coffee suitability ("oasis") anticipating lower competition in the future. If those mills are also better at establishing relational contracts with farmers then our identification strategy would be invalid.Our instrument relies on cross-sectional variation in suitability for mill entry.

        <p>To assuage these concerns, we check how the mills' order of entry into the industry correlates with the suitability score within 5 km (catchment area) and between 5 and 10 km (instrument) from the actual mill's entry location. We expect earlier entrants to locate in places with a higher suitability score within 5 km from the mill. Under the dynamic strategic entry considerations above we expect earlier entrants to locate in areas with worse surrounding of mill placement. In contrast, the validity of our identification strategy suggests that we should see no correlation between the order of entry and the instrument, conditional on suitability within the catchment area. entrants locate in catchment areas with higher suitability for mill placement while later entrants settle for locations with lower suitability. The corresponding trend for the instrument is also negative. We thus find the opposite of what would be implied by strategic dynamic entry considerations. The negative trend in the instrument is driven by spatial correlation: conditional on suitability within the catchment area, the instrument is uncorrelated with the order of entry.To assuage these concerns, we check how the mills' order of entry into the industry correlates with the suitability score within 5 km (catchment area) and between 5 and 10 km (instrument) from the actual mill's entry location.

        <p>Numerous field visits and conversations with investors and the coffee board give us confidence in our identification strategy. These conversations reveal that indeed investors do consider multiple locations before deciding where to establish a mill. They also report, however, to base their decisions on conditions prevailing in the vicinity of the considered locations. To find potential "oases" (and invalidate our identification strategy) investors would need to scope an area of (10 2 -5 2 ) × π) ≈ 235.50 km 2 , well beyond the locations they are considering.

        <p>A final concern is that mills in more competitive areas might just be worse quality mills along other (unobserved) dimensions.

        <p>when more mills enter, only the best can survive. Second, if surrounding competition matters for the ability to sustain relational contracts, a mill contemplating entering at a location will find it less profitable to enter there conditional on that location's suitability measure. As a result, the mills that do enter will likely be more efficient and more able to sustain relational contracting (e.g., have a higher discount factor) than mills that enter in locations without competition. 40 sis we have defined the catchment area to have a constant radius across mills. Mills, however, differ in installed capacity to process coffee cherries and, plausibly, in how far they source coffee cherries from. Column (6) provides a further robustness check in which we define a mill's catchment area to have a radius of either 3, 5 or 7 kms depending on mill's processing capacity. Results are, again, robust to this alternative definition of catchment size.when more mills enter, only the best can survive.

        <p>We have also defined competition to mill i as the number of mills whose catchment area overlaps with that of mill i. It would seem natural, however, to define the intensity of competition relative to the availability of coffee cherries in a given locality; areas more suitable for coffee cultivation will have more coffee trees and also attract more competitors. To account for this, our baseline specifications control for the density of trees in a mill's catchment area. However, as noted above, controlling for trees might induce a bad control problem.We have also defined competition to mill i as the number of mills whose catchment area overlaps with that of mill i.

        <p>The negative impact of competition on mill's outcomes could reflect scale effects induced by business stealing, as in Mankiw and Whinston (1986). Mankiw and Whinston (1986) model an industry in which firms incur fixed costs to enter and then compete over consumers. An additional entrant reduces incumbents' production volume (business stealing) and induces excessive entry through the inefficient duplication of fixed costs. The framework is relevant for, and can be applied to, our context in which coffee mills incur fixed costs and compete over farmers. It is thus important to understand hand, a narrower catchment area is more likely to violate the exclusion restriction.The negative impact of competition on mill's outcomes could reflect scale effects induced by business stealing, as in Mankiw and Whinston (1986).

        <p>The predictions of the mechanism in Mankiw and Whinston (1986) are inconsistent with two additional pieces of evidence. First, in order for business stealing to be relevant, mills must compete over scarce coffee supply. In contrast, there is plenty of coffee to be processed. In 2012, the year of our survey, the share of coffee processed by mills was around 33%. This aggregate figure however is not conclusive: it could be that mills are concentrated in regions in which there is scarcity of coffee cherries relative to installed capacity while most of the home processed coffee originates in regions in which mills have not entered for unrelated reasons.The predictions of the mechanism in Mankiw and Whinston (1986) are inconsistent with two additional pieces of evidence.

        <p>Panel A defines capacity as the sum of capacity across all mills competing with a mill i according to our baseline definition of competition. This provides an implausibly conservative bound because it assumes that all mills competing with mill i source all their cherries in mill's i catchment area. Even then, we find that in roughly just over 50% of catchment areas the ratio is below one, that is, there is more coffee available than installed capacity. When, more plausibly and consistently with our empirical strategy, we weigh the capacity of each competitor by the area of overlap between the two catchment areas, the estimated ratio is below one in 98% of catchment areas (Panel B). That is, almost everywhere there is excess supply of coffee to be processed and thus scarcity of coffee induced by competition should not be a constraint to mills operation.Panel A defines capacity as the sum of capacity across all mills competing with a mill i according to our baseline definition of competition.

Potential capacity is defined as c i + j A ij π×5 2 c j , where A ij denotes area of overlap between mills i and j. The estimated ratio is below one in 98% of catchment areas, which is to say that almost everywhere there is excess supply of coffee cherries to be processed.</p>
        <p>An additional piece of evidence comes from the relationship between competition Note: Panel A (left) is a binned scatter plot of cherries purchased by an individual mill against suitability score (5 to 10 km) with a linear fit. Panel B (right) shows the aggregate quantity which sums up the cherries purchased by competing mills including own. Mill i has competing mill j if mill j is located within 10 km from mill i. Panel B shows binned scatter plot of this aggregate quantity against the suitability score with a quadratic fit (semi-parametric). All regressions control for NGO-support, cooperative status, mill age, mill age squared and mill coordinates. Controls also include average engineering suitability score, average spring presence, road density, tree density, rivers, flexible control of FAO-GAEZ coffee suitability, elevation and slope, all within 5 km of the mill.An additional piece of evidence comes from the relationship between competition Note: Panel A (left) is a binned scatter plot of cherries purchased by an individual mill against suitability score (5 to 10 km) with a linear fit.

        <p>In sum, we find several pieces of evidence suggesting that competition lowers the aggregate amount of coffee processed by mills. This is consistent with the implications of a model in which competition breaks down relational contracts between mills and farmers and not consistent with outcomes being entirely driven by a business stealing effect in the presence of fixed costs.In sum, we find several pieces of evidence suggesting that competition lowers the aggregate amount of coffee processed by mills.

        <p>Incentive Compatibility Constraints: This section spells out all the incentive compatibility constraints associated with the relational contract. We derive conditions under which the following actions occur in each period of a stationary relational contract: (i ) at pre-harvest either I k i = 1 or I k i = 0; (ii ) the farmer sells to the mill, x i = 1; and (iii ) the mill makes payments P i,1 and P i,2 at harvest and post-harvest.Incentive Compatibility Constraints: This section spells out all the incentive compatibility constraints associated with the relational contract.

        <p>Several incentive compatibility constraints must be met for such relational contract to be self-enforcing. First, if the relational contract specifies I k i = 1, the mill must be willing to incur cost k pre-harvest rather than not doing so and ceasing all interactions with the farmer.

        <p>Second, at harvest, the farmer must prefer to sell to the mill rather than taking her outside option and then losing access to the mill in the future. 38 Note that the farmer's per-period payoff in the relational contract is given by u(c i,1 , c i,2 ) = min{P i,1 , P i,2 }. If the farmer side-sells she gets (1 + I k i π)q × u(ρ, C i ) this season and her outside option q × u(ρ, C i ) forever after.

        <p>We now consider different assumptions on the structure of the error term in equation ( 7). There are two main concerns: (i ) the instrument is the average of a grid suitability score, a predicted variable; (ii ) errors could be spatially correlated across mills. Table II reports confidence interval under three different assumptions on the structure of the error term. Considering the baseline IV specification in column 4, we describe each procedure starting with the most conservative. A first procedure simply bootstraps the two-stage estimation, using the entire sample of grid points to predict the score at the grid level for the mill-level regression. This procedure yields the most conservative standard error for the main coefficient of interest (0.088, p-value &lt; 0.01). The following two procedures allow for error terms to be spatially correlated across mills. A first procedure allows for arbitrary spatial clustering as in Konig et al. (2017). A second procedure adjusts for spatial clustering as in Conley (1999). These two procedures yield standard error estimates of 0.075 and 0.068 respectively. To simplify exposition, in our main analysis we only report estimates with the most conservative method.We now consider different assumptions on the structure of the error term in equation ( 7).
