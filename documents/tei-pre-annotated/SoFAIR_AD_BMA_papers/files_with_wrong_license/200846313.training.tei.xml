        <p>We investigate how transaction costs change the number of characteristics that are jointly significant for an investor's optimal portfolio, and hence, how they change the dimension of the cross section of stock returns. We find that transaction costs increase the number of significant characteristics from six to 15. The explanation is that, as we show theoretically and empirically, combining characteristics reduces transaction costs because the trades in the underlying stocks required to rebalance different characteristics often cancel out. Thus, transaction costs provide an economic rationale for considering a larger number of characteristics than that in prominent asset-pricing models.We investigate how transaction costs change the number of characteristics that are jointly significant for an investor's optimal portfolio, and hence, how they change the dimension of the cross section of stock returns.

        <p>Hundreds of variables have been proposed to explain the cross-section of stock returns; see, for instance, Harvey, Liu, and Zhu (2015), McLean and Pontiff (2016), and Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2017). This abundance of cross-sectional predictors leads Cochrane (2011) to ask, "Which characteristics really provide independent information about average returns? Which are subsumed by others?" Likewise, Goyal (2012) states that "these days one has a multitude of variables that seem to explain the cross-sectional pattern of returns. The amount of independent information in these variables is unclear as no study to date [...] has conducted a comprehensive study to analyze the joint impact of these variables."Hundreds of variables have been proposed to explain the cross-section of stock returns; see, for instance, Harvey, Liu, and Zhu (2015), McLean and Pontiff (2016), and Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2017).

        <p>Cochrane and Goyal challenge researchers to characterize the dimension of the cross-section of stock returns by identifying a small set of characteristics that subsume the rest. Several papers address this challenge in the absence of transaction costs; these include Feng, Giglio, and Xiu (2017), Freyberger, Neuhierl, and Weber (2018), Green, Hand, and Zhang (2017), Kelly, Pruitt, and Su (2018), Kozak, Nagel, and Santosh (2018), and Messmer and Audrino (2017). However, transaction costs matter for the dimension of the cross section because they impact the number of characteristics that are jointly significant for an investor's optimal portfolio. To address this gap in the literature, our objective is to study how transaction costs affect the dimension of the cross section.Cochrane and Goyal challenge researchers to characterize the dimension of the cross-section of stock returns by identifying a small set of characteristics that subsume the rest.

        <p>We build on the insightful work in Novy-Marx and Velikov (2016), which proposes a generalization of Jensen's alpha that takes transaction costs into account, and computes the "generalized alpha" of 23 characteristics with respect to the four factors in Fama and French (1993) and Carhart (1997). Novy-Marx and Velikov (2016) finds that in the presence of transaction costs the number of characteristics that have a significant generalized alpha is smaller than in the absence of transaction costs.We build on the insightful work in Novy-Marx and Velikov (2016), which proposes a generalization of Jensen's alpha that takes transaction costs into account, and computes the "generalized alpha" of 23 characteristics with respect to the four factors in Fama and French (1993) and Carhart (1997).

        <p>However, Novy-Marx and Velikov (2016) tests the significance of a single characteristic at a time. We, in contrast, consider all characteristics simultaneously and, as a result, find that the number of characteristics that are jointly significant for an investor's portfolio in the presence of transaction costs is larger than in the absence of transaction costs. The explanation for this is that, as we show theoretically and empirically, combining characteristics reduces transaction costs, and hence increases the investor's utility, because the trades in the underlying stocks required to rebalance different characteristics often cancel each other out. 1 Essentially, combining characteristics allows one to diversify trading, just as combining them allows one to diversify risk. As a consequence, our work shows that the impact of transaction costs is smaller when considering characteristics jointly than when considering them one at a time, as in Novy-Marx and Velikov (2016).However, Novy-Marx and Velikov (2016) tests the significance of a single characteristic at a time.

        <p>We first quantify the benefits from trading diversification in a simple manner by comparing the average trading volume (turnover) required to exploit an equally weighted portfolio of characteristics simultaneously with that required to exploit them in isolation.We first quantify the benefits from trading diversification in a simple manner by comparing the average trading volume (turnover) required to exploit an equally weighted portfolio of characteristics simultaneously with that required to exploit them in isolation.</p>
        <p>Analytically, we show that the turnover required to rebalance an equally weighted portfolio of K characteristics is about 1/ √ K of that required to rebalance the characteristics in isolation. Empirically, we find that while the average monthly turnover required to exploit a characteristic in isolation is 24.09%, the turnover required to exploit an equally weighted combination of characteristics is only 6.71%; that is, trading diversification delivers a 72.15% reduction in turnover. Note that a reduction in turnover will translate into a reduction in transaction costs regardless of the particular manner in which transaction costs are modeled.Analytically, we show that the turnover required to rebalance an equally weighted portfolio of K characteristics is about 1/ √ K of that required to rebalance the characteristics in isolation.

        <p>We then turn to our main research question of how transaction costs impact the dimension of the cross section. To answer this question, we study how many firm-specific characteristics matter jointly from a portfolio perspective; that is, from the perspective of an investor who cares not only about average returns, but also about portfolio risk and transaction costs. 2 To do this, we extend the "parametric portfolios" in Brandt, Santa-Clara, and Valkanov (2009) and use them as an alternative method to the traditional 1 For instance, assume that rebalancing a momentum portfolio requires buying $3,000 of the Apple stock, whereas rebalancing a value portfolio requires selling $2,000 of Apple. Then, rebalancing a combination of these two characteristics requires buying only $1,000 of Apple.We then turn to our main research question of how transaction costs impact the dimension of the cross section.

        <p>2 We are agnostic about whether a particular characteristic is a proxy for the loading on a common risk factor or not; instead, we account for risk directly via the mean-variance utility of the investor.2 We are agnostic about whether a particular characteristic is a proxy for the loading on a common risk factor or not; instead, we account for risk directly via the mean-variance utility of the investor.</p>

        <p>To determine which characteristics are jointly significant, we use a "screen-and-clean" method to test which characteristics have parametric-portfolio weights that are significantly different from zero. We then use this test to compare the number of characteristics that are jointly significant in the absence and presence of transaction costs.To determine which characteristics are jointly significant, we use a "screen-and-clean" method to test which characteristics have parametric-portfolio weights that are significantly different from zero.

        <p>We find that in the absence of transaction costs, out of the 51 characteristics that we consider, only a small number-about six-are significant. Moreover, in contrast to what one would observe if evaluating characteristics in isolation, we find that transaction costs increase the number of jointly significant characteristics from six to 15, thus increasing the dimension of the cross section. 4 This is because the benefits of trading diversification are large when combining characteristics to maximize the investor's expected utility: we find empirically that the marginal transaction cost of trading the stocks underlying a characteristic is reduced by 65% on average when characteristics are combined optimally in the parametric portfolio.We find that in the absence of transaction costs, out of the 51 characteristics that we consider, only a small number-about six-are significant.

        <p>Our findings have implications for asset-pricing theories based on stochastic discount factors (SDFs) because the investor's first-order optimality condition determines not only her optimal portfolio but also the associated SDF, as shown in Appendix B.

        <p>To alleviate data-mining concerns raised in the literature, 5 we also undertake an out-of-sample analysis. We find that the out-of-sample performance of the parametric portfolios in the presence of transaction costs can be significantly improved by exploiting a large number of characteristics instead of the small number typically considered in popular asset-pricing models. 6We now discuss how our work is related to the literature. Several papers use crosssectional regressions to study the dimension of the cross section because they allow one to test which characteristics are jointly significant; see, for instance, Green et al. (2017), Freyberger et al. (2018), and Messmer and Audrino (2017). Light, Maslov, and Rytchkov (2017) uses an information-aggregation technique based on the three-pass regression filter in Kelly and Pruitt (2015) to aggregate multiple characteristics into a few composite variables that predict the cross section of expected stock returns. While all of these papers ignore transaction costs, we focus on the effect of transaction costs. Another difference is that while cross-sectional regressions focus on mean returns, our portfolio approach accounts for both mean and variance of returns.To alleviate data-mining concerns raised in the literature, 5 we also undertake an out-of-sample analysis.

        <p>The time-series approach regresses the return of a characteristic-based long-short portfolio on the returns of a few commonly accepted factors. If the intercept (or alpha) is statistically significant, then the return on the characteristic is not fully explained by the commonly accepted factors. Gibbons, Ross, and Shanken (1989) shows that this approach captures the tradeoff between mean return and risk. Novy-Marx and Velikov (2016) extends time-series regressions to capture transaction costs. The focus of the timeseries approach on the regression intercept implies that it evaluates the significance of a single characteristic at a time. This is a limitation because, as we show in Appendix A.2, the significance results depend on the sequence in which variables are selected. In contrast, our portfolio approach considers all characteristics simultaneously.7The time-series approach regresses the return of a characteristic-based long-short portfolio on the returns of a few commonly accepted factors.

        <p>There are also papers that combine elements from both cross-sectional and timeseries regressions; see, for instance, Back, Kapadia, and Ostdiek (2015), Baker, Luo, andTaliaferro (2017), andFeng et al. (2017). Just as for time-series regressions, the inference in these papers also depends on the sequence in which characteristics are tested.There are also papers that combine elements from both cross-sectional and timeseries regressions; see, for instance, Back, Kapadia, and Ostdiek (2015), Baker, Luo, andTaliaferro (2017), andFeng et al.

        <p>Finally, the stochastic discount factor (SDF) approach is closely related to our portfolio approach because the first-order optimality condition of the investor determines not only her optimal portfolio but also the associated SDF. Kozak, Nagel, and Santosh (2018) proposes a robust SDF and finds that a small number of principle components predict the cross section better than a small number of characteristics. There are two main differences between this paper and our work. First, we study the impact of transaction costs on the dimension of the cross section of stock returns. Second, while Kozak et al. (2018) focuses on prediction, our work focuses on inference because we wish to study how transaction costs impact the number of characteristics that are jointly significant.Finally, the stochastic discount factor (SDF) approach is closely related to our portfolio approach because the first-order optimality condition of the investor determines not only her optimal portfolio but also the associated SDF.

        <p>Several papers study the transaction costs associated with trading individual characteristics. Korajczyk and Sadka (2004) finds that momentum can be exploited on only a modest scale. Novy-Marx and Velikov (2016) finds that simple transaction-cost mitigation strategies such as introducing a buy/hold spread can substantially reduce transaction costs. Chen and Velikov (2017) shows that if, in addition to transaction costs, one accounts for post-publication decay, the profitability of anomaly-based trading strategies is substantially diminished. These papers use publicly available datasets to estimate the trading costs of an average investor. In contrast, Frazzini, Israel, and Moskowitz (2015) uses proprietary data and finds that the trading costs associated with exploiting size, momentum, and book to market can be quite small for large institutional investors.Several papers study the transaction costs associated with trading individual characteristics.

        <p>Other papers have also found that combining characteristics helps to reduce transaction costs. Frazzini et al. (2015) explains that "value and momentum trades tend to offset each other, resulting in lower turnover which has real transaction costs benefits." Barroso and Santa-Clara (2015) considers currency portfolios based on six characteristics and explains that "transaction costs depend crucially on the time-varying interaction between characteristics." Novy-Marx and Velikov (2016) studies "filtering," a cost mit-igation technique that allows investors trading one strategy to opportunistically take small positions in another at effectively negative trading costs. The distinguishing feature of our work is that we consider a large number of characteristics jointly to show how transaction costs lead to an increase in the dimension of the cross section.Other papers have also found that combining characteristics helps to reduce transaction costs.

        <p>We combine U.S. stock-market information from CRSP, Compustat, and I/B/E/S, covering the period from January 1980 to December 2014. We start by compiling data on the 100 firm-specific characteristics considered in Green et al. (2017), 8 but drop characteristics with a large proportion of missing observations to ensure that our results are reliable. Specifically, we drop characteristics with more than 5% of missing observations for more than 5% of firms with CRSP returns available for the entire sample from 1980 to 2014. In addition, we drop characteristics without any observations for more than 1% of these firms. Table 1 lists the resulting 51 characteristics together with their definitions, the name of the author(s) who identified them, and the date and journal of publication.We combine U.S. stock-market information from CRSP, Compustat, and I/B/E/S, covering the period from January 1980 to December 2014.

        <p>Our initial database contains every firm traded on the NYSE, AMEX, and NAS-DAQ exchanges. We then remove firms with negative book-to-market ratios. As in Brandt et al. (2009), we also remove firms below the 20th percentile of market capitalization because these are very small firms that are difficult to trade. Our final dataset contains 51 firm-specific characteristics for a total of 17,930 firms of which an average of 3,071 firms have return data in a particular month.Our initial database contains every firm traded on the NYSE, AMEX, and NAS-DAQ exchanges.

        <p>We cross-sectionally winsorize each characteristic; that is, we replace extreme observations that are beyond a certain threshold with the value of the threshold. Specifically, we set equal to the third (first) quartile plus (minus) three times the interquartile range any observations that are above (below) this threshold. 9 8 As in Green et al. (2017), when constructing monthly characteristics at time t, we assume that annual (quarterly) accounting data is available at the end of month t -1 if the firm's fiscal year ended at least six (four) months earlier. 9 This winsorization is the one used in the 2014 version of Green et al. (2017). Section IA.9 of the revised internet appendix shows that our findings are robust to winsorizing the data at the 1st and 99th cross-sectional percentiles, as in the published version of Green et al.

For j from 1 to 5, we remove the jthinterval from the sample and use the remaining sample returns to compute the regularized parametric portfolio for several values of δ.

        <p>For instance, Freyberger et al. (2018) and Messmer and Audrino (2017) use "adaptive lasso" and Kozak et al. (2018) uses "elastic net." These regularization methods are similar to the first (screen) stage of our approach because they employ cross-validation to maximize out-of-sample fit. However, because of our focus on significance, unlike these papers, our analysis includes a second (clean) stage that performs a bootstrap significance test on the parametric portfolios of those characteristics that survived the first (screen) stage. 19Another alternative is to use a sequential bootstrap method to test the significance of adding one more characteristic to an existing parametric portfolio. This approach would be similar to the methodology proposed in Harvey and Liu (2018) in the context of sequential factor selection. However, a sequential significance test would not capture the risk-and trading-diversification benefits from adding several characteristics simultaneously. This is crucial because both risk and transaction costs depend critically on how characteristics are combined. 20We conclude this section with some comments on the robustness of our significance test. First, the screen-and-clean significance test is unlikely to suffer from the type of overfitting bias documented in Novy-Marx (2016) and Rytchkov and Zhong (2017) because it tests the marginal significance of each characteristic when considered jointly with the others, and thus follows exactly the recommendation in Novy-Marx (2016) that "the marginal contribution of each individual signal should be evaluated individually;" see Section IA.6 of the internet appendix for a more detailed discussion. Second, our main finding that transaction costs increase the number of significant characteristics is robust to using alternative significance tests and data samples, as we show in Sections IA.3, IA.4, and IA.8 of the internet appendix. This is because our main finding is obtained by comparing the number of significant characteristics for the cases with and without transaction costs, and therefore, any differences due to the method or sample are likely to wash out. Third, because the characteristics that we consider were discovered in the literature for their ability to explain the cross-section of expected stock returns rather than something related to transaction costs and trading diversification, it is unlikely that our findings about the impact of transaction costs on the dimension of the cross section are driven by data mining.For instance, Freyberger et al.

While the average monthly turnover required to exploit the 51 characteristics in isolation is 24.09%, the turnover required to exploit an equally weighted combination of them is only 6.71%; that is, trading diversification delivers a 72.15% reduction in turnover. 23</p>
        <p>Note that this 72.15% reduction in turnover is similar in magnitude to that predicted by Part 3 of Proposition 3 for the symmetric case with zero correlation between rebalancing trades across characteristics:Note that this 72.15% reduction in turnover is similar in magnitude to that predicted by Part 3 of Proposition 3 for the symmetric case with zero correlation between rebalancing trades across characteristics:</p>
        <p>Figure 2 gives a heatmap of the correlations between the rebalancing trades for the 51 characteristics for a particular stock and shows that many of the correlations are close to zero. 24 Moreover, we find that the average correlation between rebalancing trades across the 51 characteristics and the entire universe of stocks is 5.47%, not very different from zero.

        <p>In this section, we have shown analytically and empirically that combining characteristics in an equally weighted portfolio results in a substantial reduction in turnover compared to trading them in isolation.

        <p>22 For this section only, we have adjusted the sign of every characteristic so that its associated longshort portfolio produces positive average returns. The marginal contributions to turnover are computed using Equation ( 12) for the case where the transaction-cost matrix Λ t is replaced by the identity matrix and for an equally weighted portfolio of the 51 characteristics without the benchmark; that is, w t = X t e/(51N t ), where e is the vector of ones.22 For this section only, we have adjusted the sign of every characteristic so that its associated longshort portfolio produces positive average returns.

        <p>23 In fact, Figure 1 shows that the turnover required to exploit each characteristic in isolation (blue bars) is much larger than the marginal contribution to turnover of each characteristic in an equally weighted combination (yellow bars). Most strikingly, for the volatility of share turnover (std turn) characteristic, the marginal contribution to turnover in an equally weighted combination is negative, implying that including this characteristic results in an absolute reduction in turnover of the portfolio. 24 We have produced heatmaps for several stocks as well as the heatmap for the average correlations across stocks and the insights are similar.23 In fact, Figure 1 shows that the turnover required to exploit each characteristic in isolation (blue bars) is much larger than the marginal contribution to turnover of each characteristic in an equally weighted combination (yellow bars).

        <p>We use the screen-and-clean method, described in Section 3.5 above, to test the significance of the characteristics on the sample containing the 319 monthly observations from May 1988 to December 2014. 25 When computing the parametric portfolios, we use the value-weighted portfolio as the benchmark and assume a risk-aversion parameter γ = 5. 26 The first (screen) stage finds that 10 characteristics survive the screening.

        <p>Table 2 reports the significance of each characteristic that survived the first (screen) stage. We observe from the second column of Table 2 that, in the absence of transaction costs, six characteristics are significant. Five are significant at the 5% confidence level: unexpected quarterly earnings (sue), return volatility (retvol ), asset growth (agr ), 1-month momentum (mom1m), and gross profitability (gma); and one characteristic, beta, is significant at the 10% level. Our results show that, in the absence of transaction costs, a small number of characteristics is sufficient to explain the cross section of stock returns. This is consistent with several papers in the literature.Table 2 reports the significance of each characteristic that survived the first (screen) stage.

        <p>For instance, Hou et al. (2014) and Fama and French (2016) show that four and five variables, respectively, are enough to explain the cross section. Likewise, Green et al. (2017) considers 94 characteristics and finds that 12 are jointly significant, Freyberger et al. (2018) considers 62 and finds that 13 provide independent information, and Kelly et al. (2018) considers 36 characteristics and finds that eight are significant. 27For each characteristic, the last four columns of Table 2 give the marginal contribution of the characteristic to: (i) the characteristic own-variance, (ii) the covariance of the characteristic with the other characteristics in the portfolio, (iii) the covariance of the characteristic with the benchmark portfolio, and (iv) the characteristic mean. Marginal contributions that drive the characteristic to be nonzero are in blue sans serif font, and marginal contributions that drive the characteristic toward zero are in red italic font. 28 The marginal contributions reported in Table 2 show that the five characteristics significant at the 5% level matter because they help to reduce the risk of the portfolio of characteristics and increase its mean return. 29 In contrast, the beta characteristic is significant at the 10% level only because of its ability to reduce the risk of the portfolio of characteristics. To see this, note that Table 2 shows that, consistent with the findings in the existing literature (see Black (1993)), the marginal contribution of beta to the portfolio's mean return is very small. However, the beta return has a large negative covariance with the returns of the other characteristics (marginal contribution -0.01381), and this is what makes it relevant from a portfolio perspective. This is illustrated in Figure 3, which depicts the marginal contributions of the six significant characteristics, and shows that beta has a large negative marginal contribution to the covariance with the other characteristics that helps to reduce the overall portfolio risk.For instance, Hou et al.

        <p>Table 2 also explains why size, book to market, and momentum are not significant. For instance, 12-month momentum (mom12m) and book to market (bm) are not significant, even though their expected returns are large, because their returns have a very large positive covariance with the returns of the other characteristics in the portfolio.Table 2 also explains why size, book to market, and momentum are not significant.

(2009): size, book to market, and momentum.</p>
        <p>We first observe from Table 3 that the returns of the size, book to market, and momentum characteristics are not highly correlated, with their correlation coefficients being smaller than 20%. On the other hand, the returns of the six significant characteristics we identify are more highly correlated. To understand why these characteristics with highly correlated returns are jointly significant for portfolio choice, consider the case of return volatility and beta. The returns of these two characteristics are highly positively correlated (93%), but the mean return of beta is very small. As a consequence, the investor optimally goes long the beta characteristic to hedge the risk of her short position in the return-volatility characteristic, while preserving most of its mean return. The benefit of this strategy is illustrated in Panel (a) of Figure 4, which shows the cumulative returns of a blended strategy that assigns a -50% weight to return volatility and a +50% weight to beta. This blended strategy has large cumulative returns and very low volatility. 30 Asness, Moskowitz, and Pedersen (2013) finds that the returns of value and momentum are negatively correlated and a blended strategy of these two characteristics performs well. We compare the return volatility and beta blended strategy with the value and momentum blended strategy. Panel (b) in Figure 4 shows the cumulative returns of these two blended strategies, where we have scaled them so that they have the 30 Our finding that, despite the high correlation between the return volatility and beta characteristics, the return-volatility characteristic commands a much higher average return than beta is consistent with results in the existing literature. As explained in Bali, Engle, and Murray (2016), return volatility and idiosyncratic volatility are very similar in the cross section. Therefore, the high average return of the return-volatility characteristic can be traced back to the high average return of the idiosyncraticvolatility characteristic, which is documented in Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang (2006). Moreover, Bali et al. (2016, Table 15.7) shows that the idiosyncratic risk characteristic commands a high average return mostly when computed from daily data over short horizons, which is how return volatility is computed in our analysis. Beta, on the other hand, is computed from weekly returns over the past three years, and thus delivers much lower average returns; see also Liu, Stambaugh, and Yuan (2018). same volatility. We find that the return-volatility and beta blend attains a cumulative return of 110%, whereas the value and momentum blend attains a cumulative return of around 80%.We first observe from Table 3 that the returns of the size, book to market, and momentum characteristics are not highly correlated, with their correlation coefficients being smaller than 20%.

        <p>In this section, we examine how transaction costs influence the optimal portfolio of a utility-maximizing investor, and hence, the dimension of the cross section. As explained in Section 3.2, we consider an investor who faces proportional transaction costs that decrease with firm size and over time, as in Brandt et al. (2009) and Hand and Green (2011). Sections IA.1 and IA.2 of the internet appendix, respectively, show that our findings are robust to estimating proportional transaction costs from daily price data and to considering quadratic transaction costs.In this section, we examine how transaction costs influence the optimal portfolio of a utility-maximizing investor, and hence, the dimension of the cross section.

        <p>Intuitively, one may expect that in the presence of transaction costs fewer characteristics would be significant because transaction costs can only erode the benefits from exploiting characteristics. Indeed, we find that this is the case if one were to consider each characteristic individually: Section IA.13 in the internet appendix shows that 21 characteristics are individually significant in the absence of transaction costs, but only 14 in the presence transaction costs. However, when considered jointly, we find that the number of characteristics that are jointly significant at the 5% level increases from five in the absence of transaction costs to 15 in the presence of proportional transaction costs.31Intuitively, one may expect that in the presence of transaction costs fewer characteristics would be significant because transaction costs can only erode the benefits from exploiting characteristics.

        <p>The explanation for this result can be found in Table 4, which gives the significance and marginal contributions of the characteristics for the parametric portfolios in the presence of transaction costs. Of particular interest are the last two columns of the table, which give (i) the marginal contribution of each characteristic to transaction costs when combined in the optimal parametric portfolio and (ii) the marginal contribution of each characteristic to transaction costs when traded in isolation; that is, independently from the benchmark portfolio and the other characteristics. Comparing these two columns reveals that the reason why the number of significant characteristics is larger in the presence of transaction costs is that the transaction costs associated with trading the portfolio of characteristics that maximizes the investor's utility are substantially smaller than those associated with trading characteristics in isolation. We find that the marginal transaction cost associated with trading the 15 significant characteristics is reduced by around 65% on average when they are combined in the optimal portfolio. This reduction is illustrated in Figure 5, which depicts the marginal contributions to transaction costs of the 15 significant characteristics for the case when the characteristics are combined in the optimal portfolio and in isolation.The explanation for this result can be found in Table 4, which gives the significance and marginal contributions of the characteristics for the parametric portfolios in the presence of transaction costs.

        <p>A stark example of the trading-diversification benefits from combining characteristics is the short-term reversal characteristic (mom1m in the 14th row of Table 4), which has an enormous marginal contribution to transaction costs if traded in isolation (marginal contribution 0.00857), but a dramatically smaller marginal contribution to transaction costs when traded in the optimal portfolio (marginal contribution 0.00211).A stark example of the trading-diversification benefits from combining characteristics is the short-term reversal characteristic (mom1m in the 14th row of Table 4), which has an enormous marginal contribution to transaction costs if traded in isolation (marginal contribution 0.00857), but a dramatically smaller marginal contribution to transaction costs when traded in the optimal portfolio (marginal contribution 0.00211).</p>
        <p>As a result, the short-term reversal characteristic, which is significant in the absence of transaction costs as shown in Table 2, is significant even in the presence of transaction costs when combined in the optimal portfolio of characteristics. 32In Section 4, we showed analytically and empirically that combining characteristics in an equally weighted portfolio results in a substantial reduction in turnover compared to trading them in isolation. The results in this section confirm that combining characteristics in the optimal parametric portfolio leads to a substantial reduction in transaction costs, and hence, an increase in the investor's utility. The explanation is that combining a larger number of characteristics is advantageous in the presence of transaction costs because the benefits from trading diversification grow with the number of characteristics exploited, as shown in Proposition 3. The main takeaway is that transaction costs increase the dimension of the cross-section of stock returns and provide a rationale for non-sparse characteristic-based asset-pricing models.As a result, the short-term reversal characteristic, which is significant in the absence of transaction costs as shown in Table 2, is significant even in the presence of transaction costs when combined in the optimal portfolio of characteristics. 32In Section 4, we showed analytically and empirically that combining characteristics in an equally weighted portfolio results in a substantial reduction in turnover compared to trading them in isolation.

        <p>To evaluate the out-of-sample performance of the various portfolio strategies we use a "rolling-horizon" procedure, similar to that used in DeMiguel, Garlappi, and Uppal (2009b). First, we choose a window over which to perform the estimation. The total number of monthly observations in the dataset is T tot = 419 and we choose an estimation window of T = 100. Second, using the return data over the estimation window, we compute the various portfolios we study. Third, we repeat this "rolling-window" procedure for the next month, by including the data for the next month and dropping the data for the earliest month. We continue doing this until the end of the dataset is reached.

Panel B reports the performance of three parametric portfolios: two portfolios that exploit a small number of characteristics and the regularized portfolio that exploits a large set of 51 characteristics. 34 The first parametric portfolio exploits the three characteristics considered in Brandt et al. (2009): size, book to market, and momentum. The second parametric portfolio exploits four characteristics: size, book to market, asset growth, and gross profitability, which include the investment and profitability characteristics such as those highlighted in Fama and French (2016) and Hou et al. (2014).Table 5 reports the out-of-sample performance of several portfolios in the presence of transaction costs with risk-aversion parameter γ = 5.

        <p>We observe from Table 5 that the gains from exploiting a large set of characteristics are significant: the regularized parametric portfolios achieve an out-of-sample Sharpe ratio that is 100% higher than that of the parametric portfolios based on three characteristics and 25% higher than that of the parametric portfolios based on four characteristics, with the differences being statistically significant. The magnitude of the economic gains is evident also from Figure 6, which depicts the out-of-sample cumulative returns of the value-weighted portfolio and the three parametric portfolios we consider, after scaling them so that they all have the same volatility.We observe from Table 5 that the gains from exploiting a large set of characteristics are significant: the regularized parametric portfolios achieve an out-of-sample Sharpe ratio that is 100% higher than that of the parametric portfolios based on three characteristics and 25% higher than that of the parametric portfolios based on four characteristics, with the differences being statistically significant.

        <p>The previous section demonstrates that the regularized parametric portfolios that exploit a large set of 51 characteristics significantly outperform the two parametric portfolios that exploit only small sets of characteristics. To check the robustness of this result, we run a time-series regression of the out-of-sample returns of the regularized parametric portfolio onto three sparse factor models from the literature: the Fama and French (1993) and Carhart (1997) four-factor model (FFC), the Fama and French (2016) five-factor model (FF5), and the Hou et al. (2014) four-factor model (HXZ). All factors are obtained from Kenneth French's and Lu Zhang's websites. Table 6 shows that none of these three sparse factor models fully explains the returns of the regularized parametric portfolios, which achieve an economically and statistically significant abnormal average monthly return of about 1% for each of the three models. 35 This analysis, however, does not account for the transaction costs that an investor would incur to exploit the characteristics underlying the sparse factor models. To check whether transaction costs affect the abnormal out-of-sample returns delivered by the regularized portfolio, we compute the generalized alpha in Novy-Marx and Velikov (2016).The previous section demonstrates that the regularized parametric portfolios that exploit a large set of 51 characteristics significantly outperform the two parametric portfolios that exploit only small sets of characteristics.

        <p>We see from Table A1 that the five characteristics that are significant at the 5% level in Section 5 are also jointly significant for cross-sectional regressions. However, in contrast to the finding in Section 5, beta is not significant in the Fama-MacBeth regressions even at the 10% level. This is because, as shown in Proposition A1, Fama-MacBeth slopes differ in general from parametric-portfolio weights when the returns on the characteristics are correlated over time and the investor can exploit this to reduce the risk of the mean-variance portfolio.

        <p>In this section, we study analytically and empirically the relation of our portfolio approach to the time-series regression approach in the absence of transaction costs.

        <p>that is,that is,</p>
        <p>where r n,t ∈ R is the return of the new characteristic long-short portfolio at time t, r c,t ∈ R Kc is the return of the commonly accepted characteristic long-short portfolios at time t, the error term t ∈ R follows a Normal distribution with zero mean and standard deviation σ , α T S ∈ R is the intercept of the regression, and β T S ∈ R Kc is the slope vector.where r n,t ∈ R is the return of the new characteristic long-short portfolio at time t, r c,t ∈ R Kc is the return of the commonly accepted characteristic long-short portfolios at time t, the error term t ∈ R follows a Normal distribution with zero mean and standard deviation σ , α T S ∈ R is the intercept of the regression, and β T S ∈ R Kc is the slope vector.</p>
        <p>If the intercept in this regression is significant, the return on the new characteristic is not fully explained by the return of the commonly accepted characteristics. Gibbons et al. (1989) shows that a significant intercept implies that the new characteristic-based long-short portfolio improves the investment opportunity set of a mean-variance investor who already has access to the returns of the set of commonly accepted characteristics.If the intercept in this regression is significant, the return on the new characteristic is not fully explained by the return of the commonly accepted characteristics.

        <p>The advantage of the parametric-portfolio approach is that by focusing on the slopes, it allows one to test the significance of the different characteristics when they are considered jointly. The traditional time-series approach, on the other hand, is designed to test the significance of a single characteristic when it is added to a set of commonly accepted characteristics. This is a limitation of the time-series regression approach because the result of the statistical inference depends on the sequence in which variables are selected. For instance, when regressing the return of each characteristic in our dataset onto the returns of the four Fama and French (1993) and Carhart (1997) factors downloaded from Kenneth French's website, we find that eight characteristics are significant in the absence of transaction costs, but beta is not significant. 41 Beta, however, is significant when its returns are regressed onto the four Fama and French (1993) and Carhart (1997) factors plus the return of the return-volatility long-short portfolio, because beta helps to hedge the return-volatility characteristic. 42 Accordingly, beta matters if one controls for return volatility. 43 Our portfolio approach considers all characteristics simultane-ously and finds that return volatility and beta are jointly significant together with four other characteristics. These empirical results highlight the importance of considering all characteristics simultaneously. Other advantages of our portfolio approach are that it allows one to consider transaction costs in a straightforward manner and to identify the marginal contribution of each characteristic to the investor's utility.The advantage of the parametric-portfolio approach is that by focusing on the slopes, it allows one to test the significance of the different characteristics when they are considered jointly.

        <p>where w y is the weight of the mean-variance portfolio on the new characteristic. Novy- Marx and Velikov (2016) shows that in the absence of transaction costs, the generalized alpha in (A9) equals the alpha from the traditional time-series approach. In the presence of transaction costs, this approach tests the significance of adding the new characteristic to a set of commonly accepted characteristics taking transaction costs into account. 44As discussed in Section A.2, the main advantage of our portfolio approach with respect to the time-series approach is that it considers all characteristics simultaneously and tests their significance when considered jointly, whereas the time-series regressions are designed to consider one characteristic at a time. To illustrate this, we compute the generalized alpha for each of our characteristics with respect to the four Fama and French (1993) and Carhart (1997) factors downloaded from Kenneth French's website. We find that, in the presence of transaction costs, none of the characteristic portfolios has a significant generalized alpha with respect to the four factors.45 However, in the absence of transaction costs, Section A.2 showed that eight characteristics were significant with respect to the four factors. That is, the number of characteristics that are significant with respect to the four factors for the time-series approach decreases in the presence of transaction costs when the characteristics are considered in isolation. In contrast, our portfolio approach shows that the number of significant characteristics increases in the presence of transaction costs. This is because our approach allows one to consider all characteristics simultaneously and identify the optimal combination of characteristics that results in substantial trading diversification.where w y is the weight of the mean-variance portfolio on the new characteristic.

        <p>In this appendix, we establish the relation between the investor's optimal portfolio and its associated SDF in the presence of transaction costs. For exposition purposes, we first derive the relation for the case where the transaction-cost function is differentiable, as is the case for the quadratic transaction costs that we consider in Section IA.2 of the internet appendix. Then, we show how the relation can be extended to the case where the transaction-cost function is convex, but not differentiable, as is the case for the proportional transaction costs considered in the main body of the manuscript.In this appendix, we establish the relation between the investor's optimal portfolio and its associated SDF in the presence of transaction costs.

        <p>In this appendix, we investigate the robustness of our main finding that transaction costs increase the number of significant characteristics to: estimating proportional transaction costs from daily price data, considering quadratic instead of proportional transaction costs, using alternative significance tests, excluding microcaps, applying the reality check to our significance test, expanding our dataset to consider also characteristics with a large number of missing observations, considering different subsamples, using different methods to winsorize firm characteristics, considering different levels of risk-aversion, and using different methods to standardize firm characteristics. In addition, we check the robustness of our out-of-sample results to: firm size, shortsale constraints, and the constraint on maximum turnover. We also apply a reality check to our out-of-sample analysis. Finally, we also report which characteristics are significant when considered individually instead of jointly, as done in the manuscript.In this appendix, we investigate the robustness of our main finding that transaction costs increase the number of significant characteristics to: estimating proportional transaction costs from daily price data, considering quadratic instead of proportional transaction costs, using alternative significance tests, excluding microcaps, applying the reality check to our significance test, expanding our dataset to consider also characteristics with a large number of missing observations, considering different subsamples, using different methods to winsorize firm characteristics, considering different levels of risk-aversion, and using different methods to standardize firm characteristics.

        <p>Table IA.1 shows that the number of characteristics that are significant under this specification of transaction costs is 14, while it was 15 for the transaction costs parameterized as in Brandt et al.

        <p>Moreover, we can also observe from the last two columns of Table IA.1 that, similar to the case reported in the manuscript, there is also substantial trading diversification when estimating proportional transaction costs from daily price data. In particular, we find that the marginal transaction cost associated with trading the 14 characteristics that are significant in the presence of transaction costs estimated using daily price data is reduced by around 66.71% on average when they are combined, compared to 64% for transaction costs parameterized as in Brandt et al. (2009) and Hand and Green (2011). This confirms that trading diversification benefits exist even when proportional transaction costs are estimated separately for each stock using daily price data, which allows one to account for business-cycle variation along with the effects of decimalization and the financial crisis on transaction costs.Moreover, we can also observe from the last two columns of Table IA.1 that, similar to the case reported in the manuscript, there is also substantial trading diversification when estimating proportional transaction costs from daily price data.

        <p>In the main body of the manuscript, we consider an investor who faces proportional transaction costs. Proportional transaction costs are a reasonable assumption for the average investor; see Novy-Marx and Velikov (2016) and Chen and Velikov (2017). However, for large investors, a common assumption is that the price impact of their trades is linear in the amount traded, and thus, they face quadratic transaction costs; see, for instance, Korajczyk and Sadka (2004). In this section, we show that our main finding is robust to considering quadratic transaction costs; in particular, the number of characteristics that are jointly significant at the 5% level increases from five to 19 in the presence of quadratic transaction costs.In the main body of the manuscript, we consider an investor who faces proportional transaction costs.

        <p>To calibrate our quadratic transaction cost function we rely on the empirical results in Novy-Marx and Velikov (2016), which uses Trade and Quote (TAQ) data to estimate the Kyle lambdas of individual stocks. The paper shows that the R-squared of a cross-sectional regression of log Kyle lambda on log market capitalization is 70% and the slope is not statistically distinguishable from minus one. This suggests that a reasonable approximation to the cross-sectional variation of Kyle lambdas is to assume they are inversely proportional to the market capitalization of each firm. Moreover, Novy-Marx and Velikov (2016) shows that the average price elasticity of supply, defined as the product of Kyle lambda and market capitalization, λ i,t × me i,t , is about 6.5. Based on this evidence, we assume the Kyle lambda of the ith stock at time t is λ i,t = 6.5/me i,t , where me i,t is the market capitalization of the ith stock at time t.To calibrate our quadratic transaction cost function we rely on the empirical results in Novy-Marx and Velikov (2016), which uses Trade and Quote (TAQ) data to estimate the Kyle lambdas of individual stocks.

        <p>Table IA.2 reports the significance and marginal contributions of each characteristic in the parametric portfolios. Our main finding is that, similar to the case with proportional transaction costs, the number of significant characteristics with quadratic transaction costs is substantially larger than for the case without transaction costs. In particular, the number of characteristics that are significant at the 5% level increases from five in the absence of transaction costs to 19 in the presence of quadratic transaction costs. The explanation for this result can be found by comparing the last two columns of Table IA.2, which report the marginal contribution of the characteristic to the transaction cost when traded in the optimal parametric portfolio and in isolation, respectively. 4 We observe that combining characteristics reduces the marginal contribution to quadratic transaction costs by an average of 93%; that is, the benefits from trading diversification are very large also in the presence of quadratic transaction costs.Table IA.2 reports the significance and marginal contributions of each characteristic in the parametric portfolios.

        <p>The first stage of the screen-and-clean significance test uses a lasso approach to reduce problem dimensionality by screening characteristics that are not relevant. We now repeat the screen-and-clean significance test, but employing elastic net for the first (screen) stage instead of lasso. As explained in Kozak, Nagel, and Santosh (2018), the elastic net does not impose sparsity because it calibrates two parameters: one controlling the degree of sparsity induced by a lasso constraint and the other controlling the degree of shrinkage 3 We have also considered the cases with B = $10 and $100 billion and the results are similar. 4 To compute the marginal contribution to transaction costs of a characteristic traded in isolation, we assign to the single characteristic a weight equal to the sum of the absolute values of the optimal parametric-portfolio weights for the case when characteristics are traded in combination. This allows for a meaningful comparison for the case with quadratic transaction costs.The first stage of the screen-and-clean significance test uses a lasso approach to reduce problem dimensionality by screening characteristics that are not relevant.

Consistent with elastic net not imposing sparsity, we find that the number of characteristics that survive the first (screen) stage based on the elastic net is larger than that for the screen stage based on just the lasso. However, the second (clean) stage, which tests the significance of the characteristics that survive the first (screen) stage, finds that while 9 characteristics are significant in the absence of transaction costs, 14 are significant in the presence of transaction costs.

        <p>We now discuss the relation between our results and those in Giannone, Lenza, and Primiceri (2017) and Kozak, Nagel, and Santosh (2018). While these papers focus on out-of-sample fit, our work focuses on inference because we wish to study how transaction costs impact the number of characteristics that are jointly significant. To establish significance, we rely on a two-stage screen-and-clean method similar to the methods proposed in Wasserman and Roeder (2009), Meinshausen and Yu (2009), and Meinshausen, Meier, and Buhlmann (2009). The first (screen) stage is similar to the approaches considered in Giannone et al. (2017) and Kozak et al. (2018) because it employs cross validation to calibrate the regularized parametric portfolios and, just like these papers, finds that when using an elastic net for the screen stage, it is optimal to assign a positive weight to a large number of characteristics in order to improve out-of-sample fit. 6We now discuss the relation between our results and those in Giannone, Lenza, and Primiceri (2017) and Kozak, Nagel, and Santosh (2018).

        <p>However, because of our focus on significance, unlike Giannone et al. (2017) and Kozak et al. (2018), our analysis includes also a second (clean) stage that performs a bootstrap significance test on the parametric portfolios of those characteristics that survived the first (screen) stage. This second stage finds that not all characteristics that are useful to improving out-of-sample fit are statistically significant. Our result is 5 Indeed, we find that the the lasso threshold selected by the cross-validation procedure in our test is smaller than the maximum lasso threshold contained in the grid for the cases with and without transaction costs. This demonstrates that the elastic net approach does not force sparsity, but rather that the cross-validation procedure finds it optimal to induce a certain degree of sparsity even when taking into account the trade-off between the lasso threshold and the ridge penalty.However, because of our focus on significance, unlike Giannone et al.

        <p>6 In particular, we find that 15 and 24 characteristics survive the screen stage with elastic net for the cases without and with transaction costs, respectively. This finding is in line with the results in Giannone et al. (2017), which finds that the posterior probability of inclusion of a characteristic in the model to predict the cross section of stock returns is around 60%. For our case with 51 characteristics, this would imply that approximately 30 characteristics are relevant for prediction.6 In particular, we find that 15 and 24 characteristics survive the screen stage with elastic net for the cases without and with transaction costs, respectively.

For instance, consider the above example in which value and expected profitability jointly explain the cross section, but expected profitability is not observable and instead K observable characteristics are useful for predicting expected profitability. Then, although the true dimension of the cross-section is two, the K observable characteristics are likely to survive a first (screen) stage with an elastic-net penalty.

        <p>We now study the robustness of our results to using shrinkage estimators of the covariance matrix for the second (clean) stage. To do this, we perform the screen-and-clean significance test (with elastic net for the first (screen) stage, as described in the previous section), but estimating the covariance matrix for the second (clean) stage with the IA-7 shrinkage estimator of Ledoit and Wolf (2004). Tables IA.5 and IA.6 give the significance results for the cases without and with transaction costs, respectively. We find that our main finding that transaction costs increase the dimension of the cross section is robust: while 13 characteristics are significant at the 5% level in the absence of transaction costs, 18 are significant in the presence of transaction costs. 7We now study the robustness of our results to using shrinkage estimators of the covariance matrix for the second (clean) stage.

        <p>The advantage of using the sample covariance matrix for the second (clean) stage as we do in the main body of the manuscript is that using a shrinkage estimator of the covariance matrix (based either on lasso or ridge terms) would introduce a bias on the estimates of the parametric-portfolio weights, distorting the inference results from the bootstrap test. Indeed, the screen-and-clean method proposed in Wasserman and Roeder (2009) relies on unregularized estimators for the second (clean) stage precisely to avoid the challenges associated with inference in the presence of regularization terms as explained in Bühlmann et al.

For the setting considered in Novy-Marx ( 2016),where Σ c and µ c are the sample covariance matrix and mean of the characteristic-return vector r c that contains the returns of the K characteristic long-short portfolios, and σ bc is the sample vector of covariances between the benchmark portfolio return r b and the characteristic-return vector r c .

        <p>where the returns of the K characteristic long-short portfolios are uncorrelated and have identical standard deviation σ, we have that Σ -1 c is a multiple of the identity matrix, Σ -1 c = I/σ 2 . Therefore, the mean-variance parametric-portfolio weight for each of the K characteristics coincides with the weight of the single-characteristic parametric portfolio obtained by considering that characteristic in isolation. Consequently, the t-statistic of each of the parametric-portfolio weights in the case with K characteristics coincides IA-9 with the t-statistic of the single-characteristic parametric-portfolio weight. Thus, in this case our significance test, which considers the marginal significance of each of the characteristics when considered jointly, is unlikely to suffer from overfitting.where the returns of the K characteristic long-short portfolios are uncorrelated and have identical standard deviation σ, we have that Σ -1 c is a multiple of the identity matrix, Σ -1 c = I/σ 2 .

        <p>Nonetheless, to provide further reassurance that overfitting is unlikely to affect our significance test, we adapt the reality check in White (2000) to check the robustness of our significance test.8 First, we set the benchmark portfolio equal to the in-sample optimal parametric portfolio instead of the value-weighted portfolio. By doing this we essentially remove the predictability from our dataset while preserving the correlation structure of the 51 characteristics. Second, we implement a variant of the screen-andclean test.9 Specifically, we generate 1,000 bootstrap samples from the original dataset using sampling with replacement. For each of the 1,000 bootstrap samples we use five-fold cross-validation to select the lasso threshold that optimizes the mean-variance criterion and we screen any characteristics with zero weight for the resulting regularized parametric portfolio. We then compute the optimal parametric portfolio of the characteristics that have survived the screen stage for each bootstrap sample, but without the lasso constraint. Finally, we use the percentile-interval method to establish the significance of the characteristics across the 1,000 samples. Table IA.9 gives the results for the reality check for both the cases with and without transaction costs. We observe that after removing the predictability from our dataset, none of the 51 characteristics are significant either in the absence or presence of transaction costs.Nonetheless, to provide further reassurance that overfitting is unlikely to affect our significance test, we adapt the reality check in White (2000) to check the robustness of our significance test.8 First, we set the benchmark portfolio equal to the in-sample optimal parametric portfolio instead of the value-weighted portfolio.

        <p>To ensure our results are reliable, we consider in our main analysis only characteristics with a small proportion of missing observations. Specifically, we drop characteristics with more than 5% of missing observations for more than 5% of those firms with CRSP returns available for the entire sample from 1980 to 2014. In addition, we drop characteristics without any observations for more than 1% of these firms. Consequently, our main analysis is based on 51 out of the 100 characteristics listed in Green, Hand, and Zhang IA-10 (2017). However, to check the robustness of our results, we also run the screen-and-clean significance test of Section 3.5 using all 100 characteristics. Tables IA.10 and IA.11 report the results for the cases without and with transaction costs, respectively. We find that our results are robust to the inclusion of characteristics with a large proportion of missing observations. First, in the absence of transaction costs, out of the 100 characteristics, only seven are significant at the 5% level, compared to five in the case with 51 characteristics. Second, in the presence of transaction costs, the number of significant characteristics increases to 15, just as in the case with 51 characteristics.To ensure our results are reliable, we consider in our main analysis only characteristics with a small proportion of missing observations.

We find that for the period before 2003 the number of significant characteristics increases from eight in the absence of transaction costs to 14 in the presence of transaction costs. For the period after 2003, the number of significant characteristics increases from two in the absence of transaction costs to four in the presence of transaction costs. Our results confirm that our main finding that transaction costs increase the dimension of the cross section is robust to considering these subsamples. Our results also confirm the finding in Chordia, Subrahmanyam, and Tong (2014) that the magnitude of asset return predictability has decreased in the last decade.Tables IA.12-IA.15 report the results.

        <p>In particular, we find that the number of significant characteristics in the later subsample is smaller than in the earlier one. 10 10 There are two reasons why we choose to split the sample around January 2003: first, Green et al. (2017) shows that the number of priced characteristics in the cross-section of stock returns suffers an abrupt drop after 2003. This subsample choice allows us to check the robustness of this result. Second, we need to have a comparable number of observations in the two subperiods we consider, and therefore January 2003 seems a reasonable cutoff point.In particular, we find that the number of significant characteristics in the later subsample is smaller than in the earlier one. 10 10 There are two reasons why we choose to split the sample around January 2003: first, Green et al.

        <p>To study how the out-of-sample performance of the regularized parametric portfolios depends on firm size, we classify stocks (including those with market capitalization below the 20th percentile of our sample, which are excluded in our main analysis) into five size quintiles. Table IA.30 reports the out-of-sample performance of the parametric portfolios in the presence of transaction costs applied to each of the five quintiles separately. It is clear from the table that the performance of the regularized parametric portfolios is better for the quintiles with small stocks. Indeed, this table demonstrates that the regularized parametric portfolios outperform the benchmark value-weighted portfolios significantly for the first four quintiles corresponding to the 80% of smallest stocks. These results are consistent with the findings in Hand and Green (2011) and Fama and French (2008). Also, the regularized parametric portfolios significantly outperform the parametric portfolios based on a small number of characteristics for the first three quintiles corresponding to the 60% of the smallest stocks.To study how the out-of-sample performance of the regularized parametric portfolios depends on firm size, we classify stocks (including those with market capitalization below the 20th percentile of our sample, which are excluded in our main analysis) into five size quintiles.

        <p>Table IA.31 reports the out-of-sample performance of the regularized portfolios subject to shortsale constraints. 11 Panel A reports the performance for the parametric portfolios with no shortselling and Panel B reports the performance for the parametric portfolios after scaling the optimal parameter θ so that the short positions in the regularized parametric portfolio amount to around 50%. Panel A shows that with shortsale constraints, although the out-of-sample Sharpe ratio of the regularized parametric portfolios is higher than that of the value-weighted benchmark portfolio, the difference is not statistically significant. Panel B, however, shows that the amount of shorting required for the regularized parametric portfolios to significantly outperform the other portfolios is not large.Table IA.31 reports the out-of-sample performance of the regularized portfolios subject to shortsale constraints. 11 Panel A reports the performance for the parametric portfolios with no shortselling and Panel B reports the performance for the parametric portfolios after scaling the optimal parameter θ so that the short positions in the regularized parametric portfolio amount to around 50%.

        <p>We observe that for the case with around 50% shortselling, the regularized parametric portfolios attain an out-of-sample Sharpe ratio around 48% higher than that of the portfolios that exploit three characteristics and 22% higher than that of the portfolios that exploit four characteristics, with the differences being statistically significant.We observe that for the case with around 50% shortselling, the regularized parametric portfolios attain an out-of-sample Sharpe ratio around 48% higher than that of the portfolios that exploit three characteristics and 22% higher than that of the portfolios that exploit four characteristics, with the differences being statistically significant.</p>

        <p>In Section 7, we evaluate the out-of-sample performance of the regularized parametric portfolios after controlling their turnover to be around 100% per month. Table IA.32 reports the performance of the regularized parametric portfolios in the absence of turnover controls. The regularized parametric portfolios without turnover control have a monthly turnover of around 386%.

        <p>Our out-of-sample analysis shows that the regularized parametric portfolios that exploit the full set of 51 characteristics outperform the parametric portfolios that exploit only a small set of characteristics in the presence of transaction costs. These out-of-sample results provide reassurance that our main finding that transaction costs increase the dimension of the cross section is not driven by overfitting. However, to further check the robustness of our finding, we now run an additional test of our out-of-sample results in the spirit of the reality check for our in-sample returns discussed in Section IA.6 above.Our out-of-sample analysis shows that the regularized parametric portfolios that exploit the full set of 51 characteristics outperform the parametric portfolios that exploit only a small set of characteristics in the presence of transaction costs.

        <p>In particular, we compare the out-of-sample performance of the regularized parametric portfolio that exploits all 51 characteristics to a parametric portfolio that exploits the 15 in-sample significant characteristics; we estimate the weights of the parametric portfolio that exploits only the 15 in-sample significant characteristics using only past data in order to make a fair comparison. Theoretically, unless our out-of-sample results are driven by overfitting, the regularized parametric portfolio should not outperform the parametric portfolio that exploits the 15 in-sample significant characteristics. Table IA .33 shows that, while the regularized parametric portfolio significantly outperforms the two parametric portfolios that exploit a small set of characteristics, it does not significantly outperform the parametric portfolio that exploits the 15 in-sample significant characteristics. Therefore, the out-of-sample performance of the regularized parametric portfolio is unlikely to be driven by overfitting.In particular, we compare the out-of-sample performance of the regularized parametric portfolio that exploits all 51 characteristics to a parametric portfolio that exploits the 15 in-sample significant characteristics; we estimate the weights of the parametric portfolio that exploits only the 15 in-sample significant characteristics using only past data in order to make a fair comparison.

        <p>We now evaluate the significance of the 51 characteristics individually. To do this, we consider the parametric-portfolio problem defined in (9) for the case where only one characteristic is available. Because we are considering a single characteristic at a time, we do not need to use the first step of the screen-and-clean test, and instead we just run the bootstrap significance test on each of the 51 single-characteristic parametric portfolios.We now evaluate the significance of the 51 characteristics individually.

        <p>Intuitively, one may expect that in the presence of transaction costs fewer characteristics would be significant because transaction costs can only erode the benefits from exploiting characteristics. Indeed, Table IA.34 shows that this is the case when each characteristic is considered individually. After applying the Bonferroni adjustment (i.e. significance threshold = 0.05/51), Table IA.34 shows that 21 characteristics are individually significant in the absence of transaction costs, but only 14 in the presence transaction costs. This result contrasts with the finding from Tables 2 and4 in the main body of the manuscript that, when considered jointly, the number of characteristics that are jointly significant at the 5% level increases from five in the absence of transaction costs to 15 in the presence of proportional transaction costs.Intuitively, one may expect that in the presence of transaction costs fewer characteristics would be significant because transaction costs can only erode the benefits from exploiting characteristics.

        <p>Table IA.1: Significance with proportional transaction costs from daily price data This table reports the significance and marginal contributions for the parametric portfolios in the presence of transaction costs estimated from daily price data as in Abdi and Ranaldo (2017), for risk-aversion parameter γ = 5. We run a screen-and-clean significance test. For the first (screen) stage, we calibrate the regularized parametric portfolios with five-fold cross-validation and find that the lasso threshold that maximizes investor's utility is δ = 25. For the second (clean) stage, we run the bootstrap experiment for the parametric portfolios using those characteristics with nonzero θ's from the first stage. Characteristic p-values are computed using the percentile method discussed in Section 3.5. We assign three/two/one asterisks ( * ) to those characteristics whose p-values are lower than 0.01/0.05/0.1, respectively. To compute the optimal parametric portfolio and marginal contributions, we include all characteristics with nonzero θ's for the screen stage plus the three characteristics considered in Brandt et al. (2009): size, book to market, and momentum. For each characteristic, the first column gives the acronym, the second the optimal value of the parameter and the significance asterisks, and the next five columns give the marginal contribution of the characteristic to: (i) the characteristic own-variance, (ii) the covariance of the characteristic with the other characteristics in the portfolio, (iii) the covariance of the characteristic with the benchmark portfolio, (iv) the characteristic mean, and (v) the transaction cost. The last column reports the marginal contribution of the characteristic to transaction costs when it is traded in isolation. Contributions that drive the characteristic to be nonzero are in blue sans serif font, and contributions that drive the characteristic toward zero are in red italic font (cf. Footnote 28). This table reports the significance and marginal contributions for the parametric portfolios in the presence of quadratic transaction costs, for the case where the investor allocates B = $1 billion to the benchmark portfolio and has an absolute risk-aversion parameter γ a = 5/B. We run a screen-and-clean significance test. For the first (screen) stage, we calibrate the regularized parametric portfolios with five-fold cross-validation and find that the lasso threshold that maximizes investor's utility is δ = 1.5 × B. For the second (clean) stage, we run the bootstrap experiment for the parametric portfolios using those characteristics with nonzero θ's from the first stage.

For each characteristic, the first column gives the acronym, the second the optimal value of the parameter and the significance asterisks, and the next five columns give the marginal contribution of the characteristic to: (i) the characteristic own-variance, (ii) the covariance of the characteristic with the other characteristics in the portfolio, (iii) the covariance of the characteristic with the benchmark portfolio, (iv) the characteristic mean, and (v) the transaction cost. The last column reports the marginal contribution of the characteristic to transaction costs when it is traded in isolation. Contributions that drive the characteristic to be nonzero are in blue sans serif font, and contributions that drive the characteristic toward zero are in red italic font (cf. Footnote 28). This table reports the significance and marginal contributions for the parametric portfolios in the presence of quadratic transaction costs, for the case where the investor allocates B = $1 billion to the benchmark portfolio and has an absolute risk-aversion parameter γ a = 5/B. We run a screen-and-clean significance test. For the first (screen) stage, we calibrate the regularized parametric portfolios with five-fold cross-validation and find that the lasso threshold that maximizes investor's utility is δ = 1.5 × B. For the second (clean) stage, we run the bootstrap experiment for the parametric portfolios using those characteristics with nonzero θ's from the first stage. Characteristic p-values are computed using the percentile method discussed in Section 3.5. We assign three/two/one asterisks ( * ) to those characteristics whose p-values are lower than 0.01/0.05/0.1, respectively.</p>

For each characteristic, the first column gives the acronym, the second the optimal value of the parameter and the significance asterisks, and the next five columns give the marginal contribution of the characteristic to: (i) the characteristic own-variance, (ii) the covariance of the characteristic with the other characteristics in the portfolio, (iii) the covariance of the characteristic with the benchmark portfolio, (iv) the characteristic mean, and (v) the transaction cost. The last column reports the marginal contribution of the characteristic to transaction costs when it is traded in isolation. Contributions that drive the characteristic to be nonzero are in blue sans serif font, and contributions that drive the characteristic toward zero are in red italic font (cf. Footnote 28). This table reports the significance and marginal contributions for the parametric portfolios without transaction costs, for risk-aversion parameter γ = 5, for the subsample from January 2003 to December 2014. We run a screen-and-clean significance test. For the first (screen) stage, we calibrate the regularized parametric portfolios with five-fold cross-validation and find that the lasso threshold that maximizes investor's utility is δ = 10. For the second (clean) stage, we run the bootstrap experiment for the parametric portfolios using those characteristics with nonzero θ's from the first stage. Characteristic p-values are computed using the percentile method discussed in Section 3.5. We assign three/two/one asterisks ( * ) to those characteristics whose p-values are lower than 0.01/0.05/0.1, respectively.

        <p>Note that lasso can be interpreted also as a sequential procedure because as one increases the lasso threshold δ, the regularized parametric portfolios assign a nonzero weight to a larger number of characteristics. However, the lasso does not suffer from the limitation of a purely sequential procedure because it allows for characteristics to drop out of the active set as the lasso threshold increases; seeEfron and Hastie (2016, Section 16.4).

        <p>In contrast to these papers,Kozak et al. (2018) finds that, in the absence of transaction costs, a small number of principal components predict the cross section better than a small number of characteristics. The explanation for these contrasting results is that whileKozak et al.

        <p>(2018). This suggest that, while a large number of characteristics may help to predict the cross section, not all may be statistically significant.28 Note that for characteristics with a positive parametric-portfolio weight, negative (positive) marginal contributions help to decrease (increase) the objective function in the minimization problem (9) and thus increase (decrease) the investor's mean-variance utility. Therefore, for characteristics with positive parametric-portfolio weights, negative (positive) marginal contributions are in blue sans serif font (red italic font). The opposite color and font convention applies to characteristics with negative parametric-portfolio weights.29 For instance, return volatility has large positive mean return (marginal contribution 0.00323) and negative return covariance with the other characteristics (marginal contribution 0.02914).(2018).

        <p>This result contrasts with DeMiguel, Nogales, and Uppal (2014) andNovy-Marx and Velikov (2016) that find that the short-term reversal characteristic is not profitable after transaction costs when traded in isolation.DeMiguel et al. (2014) finds that a short-term reversal (contrarian) strategy is not profitable in the presence of even modest proportional transaction costs of 10 basis points. Novy-Marx and Velikov (2016) finds that the short-term reversal strategy does not improve the investment opportunity set of an investor with access to theFama and French (2016) andCarhart (1997) factors, even when a buy-and-hold transaction-cost-mitigation strategy is employed.This result contrasts with DeMiguel, Nogales, and Uppal (2014) andNovy-Marx and Velikov (2016) that find that the short-term reversal characteristic is not profitable after transaction costs when traded in isolation.DeMiguel et al.

        <p>Note that to reduce computation time, we compute the optimal parameter vector θ only in January of each year, and use this parameter vector to compute the parametric portfolios for every month of the year. Also, we find that the regularized parametric portfolios that solve problem (15)-(16) result in very large turnovers. Although we find that these portfolios are profitable even after transaction costs (see Section IA.12.3 of the internet appendix), they may not be implementable for institutional investors facing turnover constraints. Therefore, we report the results for the parametric portfolios after scaling them to control for turnover. Specifically, we scale the optimal parameter vector θ so that the portfolio monthly turnover is around 100%.Note that to reduce computation time, we compute the optimal parameter vector θ only in January of each year, and use this parameter vector to compute the parametric portfolios for every month of the year.

        <p>This table reports the out-of-sample performance of the regularized parametric portfolios in the presence of transaction costs and shortsale constraints, for risk-aversion parameter γ = 5. Panel A reports the performance for the parametric portfolios with no shortselling, and Panel B reports the performance for the parametric portfolios with 50% shortselling. Each panel reports the results for four portfolios: the benchmark value-weighted portfolio (VW), which has zero shortselling in both panels, two parametric portfolios that exploit a small number of characteristics, and the regularized parametric portfolio that exploits a large set of 51 characteristics. The first parametric portfolio exploits the size, book-to-market, and momentum characteristics (Size/val./mom.). The second parametric portfolio exploits the size, book-to-market, asset growth, and gross profitability characteristics (Size/val./inv./prof.). For the regularized parametric portfolio (Regularized), the lasso threshold is calibrated using cross-validation over the estimation window. For each portfolio, the first column reports the monthly turnover, and the next three columns report the out-ofsample annualized mean, standard deviation, and Sharpe ratio of returns, net of transaction costs.
