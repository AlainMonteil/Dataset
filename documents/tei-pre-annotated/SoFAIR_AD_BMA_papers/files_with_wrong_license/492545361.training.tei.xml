        <p>African swine fever (ASF) is a fatal and highly infectious haemorrhagic disease that has spread to all provinces in China -the world's largest producer and consumer of pork. Here, we use an input-output (I-O) model, partial equilibrium theory and a substitution indicator approach for handling missing data to develop a systematic valuation framework for assessing economic losses caused by ASF outbreaks in China between August 2018 and July 2019. We show that the total economic loss accounts for 0.78% of China's GDP in 2019, with impacts experienced in almost all economic sectors through links to the pork industry and a substantial decrease in consumer surplus.African swine fever (ASF) is a fatal and highly infectious haemorrhagic disease that has spread to all provinces in China -the world's largest producer and consumer of pork.

        <p>African Swine Fever (ASF) is classified by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as a List A disease, with mortality up to 100% [1][2][3] . The latest large outbreak of ASF was reported in China, the world's biggest producer and consumer of pork, in August 2018 and have killed millions of pigs 4 . Due to the absence of effective vaccines and treatment and proper sanitary and hygiene practices, it has been a great challenge to eradicate the disease 5,6 . Particularly in China, a large proportion of pigs are kept on small-sized farms which lack the capacity for infection prevention and the control of pig diseases. This makes ASF very difficult to eradicate in China. Since the outbreak occurs, huge efforts have been made to prevent and control the fast spread of the disease, including a strict stamping-out policy, the delineating of quarantine zones of infected areas, and the rigorous culling of infected herds [7][8][9] . These measures inevitably induce large economic losses and affect many people and related industries 10,11 .African Swine Fever (ASF) is classified by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as a List A disease, with mortality up to 100% [1][2][3] .

        <p>This study, therefore, aims to propose a valuation framework for assessing the extent of both the direct and indirect financial losses caused by the ASF outbreaks in China over the period from August 2018 to July 2019. Although this ASF epidemic has not completely ended in China when we revised the paper (July 2021), we chose to look at this one-year period as an estimation interval based on the following consideration: the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 and has since then spread rapidly across the whole of China and the world. The COVID-19 pandemic is not only a public health crisis but has also severely affected the Chinese economy. Thus, only examining the period before the outbreak of the coronavirus allows us to focus on the impact of the ASF epidemic, and our findings will help further studies to disentangle the economic impacts of these two overlapping epidemics.This study, therefore, aims to propose a valuation framework for assessing the extent of both the direct and indirect financial losses caused by the ASF outbreaks in China over the period from August 2018 to July 2019.

        <p>We then develop an economic loss assessment framework of animal epidemics, which integrates substitution indicator estimation, the input-output (IO) model and partial equilibrium theory. We estimate the direct economic losses to China's swine industry from three aspects: the financial losses from the culling and removal of infected carcasses, the financial losses from damaged reproductive capacity due to the losses of breeding pigs, and the financial losses from supply disruptions caused by the abandonment of farming and other factors, such as underreporting. We also evaluate the economic losses to all sectors in China using the IO model. Furthermore, the loss in consumer surplus caused by the outbreaks of ASF and the costs incurred by the state and local governments in relation to the prevention and control of the epidemic are assessed and discussed. Finally, we provide a scenario analysis based on different assumptions regarding the reduction in pig production and price increase caused by ASF. Our findings can help Chinese policy makers to better understand the financial losses of the ASF epidemic and evaluate the effectiveness of related policies, and also provides a scientific decision-making reference for countries affected by animal diseases, to help them formulate tailored epidemic prevention and control measures, and livelihood and food safety policies.We then develop an economic loss assessment framework of animal epidemics, which integrates substitution indicator estimation, the input-output (IO) model and partial equilibrium theory.

        <p>Since August 2018, ASF has been detected in Shenyang in Liaoning province, China, and then spread to all mainland provinces. As of July 2019, there were a total of 162 ASF outbreaks in all parts of China. Fig. 1 shows the numbers of ASF outbreaks and pig deaths during the first year of the ASF pandemic. According to official data, by mid-2019, 13,355 pigs had died due to the ASF virus infection, and 1,204,281 pigs had been culled to halt the virus's spread. The epidemic has caused significant economic losses to the Chinese animal husbandry industry, and has even led to a sharp disruption in the livestock supply chain and meat consumption structure.Since August 2018, ASF has been detected in Shenyang in Liaoning province, China, and then spread to all mainland provinces.

        <p>According to China Statistical Yearbook, from 2010 to 2018, the number of pigs slaughtered and the herd size of pigs in China remained at the levels of about 700 million and 450 million heads per year. The officially released data on culling and deaths caused by the ASF accounts for less than 0.2% of the yearly number of slaughtered (healthy) pigs 12 . This figure is much smaller than some industry estimates (150-200 million) 13 , indicating that the official data may not reflect the true scale of the ASF outbreak. There are several reasons we believe the official figures may be underreported. First, in China, small and medium-sized farmers (with less than 500 heads) account for more than 95% of the pig farming industry. It is a common practice for those small and medium-sized farmers to feed untreated swill to pigs. The waste management and sanitary conditions are relatively poor, and little is invested in the prevention and control of infectious swine disease. Therefore, once a pig disease begins to circulate, those small farms will often be almost totally destroyed. A complete and accurate picture of slaughter and on-farm death figures on small and medium-sized farms is difficult to obtain. Second, due to the lack of efficient treatments and vaccines against the ASF virus, and the insufficient funds and compensations available for farmers to help them to resume breeding, most of them have decided to quit farming pigs (i.e. abandonment), at least in the short to medium term, to avoid further financial losses. This impact in terms of future shortages in the pig supply market will not be captured by the culling and death data.According to China Statistical Yearbook, from 2010 to 2018, the number of pigs slaughtered and the herd size of pigs in China remained at the levels of about 700 million and 450 million heads per year.

        <p>It is worth noting that, from 2015, the Chinese government started to introduce nonlivestock production regions (NLPRs) and pig-reallocation policies to prevent the pollution of major water sources and odour caused by agricultural activity. The implementation of those policies has caused a decrease in the number of slaughtered pigs over time. Specifically, compared with the year 2014 (i.e. 749.51 million heads), slaughtered pigs decreased by 25.36 million heads in 2015, 48.78 million in 2016, 47.49 million in 2017 and 55.69 million in 2018 14,15 , suggesting that the policies have had a lasting impact on pork production. Therefore, the shrinking supply in the pig market since the outbreak of ASF has been caused by two major factors: the remaining effect of the ban on breeding of pigs policy, which we estimate to have resulted in 46 million fewer pigs being slaughtered over our sample period, and the ramifications of the ASF epidemic.It is worth noting that, from 2015, the Chinese government started to introduce nonlivestock production regions (NLPRs) and pig-reallocation policies to prevent the pollution of major water sources and odour caused by agricultural activity.

        <p>We estimate 43.46 million pigs died due to either ASF virus infection, being culled to stamp out the virus, or other ASF-related impacts during the first year of the ASF outbreaks, accounting for 6.3% of the total number of pigs slaughtered in 2018 (i.e.We estimate 43.46 million pigs died due to either ASF virus infection, being culled to stamp out the virus, or other ASF-related impacts during the first year of the ASF outbreaks, accounting for 6.3% of the total number of pigs slaughtered in 2018 (i.e.</p>

        <p>Across the Chinese provinces, the average direct financial loss due to mortality and culling was US$8.7 million per province, and almost half of the provinces suffered more than US$4.5 million in financial losses. The province of Liaoning was the most severely damaged by ASF, with a direct financial loss that amounted to US$55 million (Fig. 2). Moreover, based on official data from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the People's Republic of China and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) 17,18 , the financial loss from decreased reproduction due to the deaths and culling of breeding pigs is estimated to have been US$681 million. The financial loss caused by abandonment and other reasons is estimated to have been US$10 billion (Supplementary Table S1).Across the Chinese provinces, the average direct financial loss due to mortality and culling was US$8.7 million per province, and almost half of the provinces suffered more than US$4.5 million in financial losses.

        <p>The total indirect economic losses to producers in all sectors of the Chinese economy (149 sectors) are estimated to have been US$14.5 billion. Across the different provinces in China, this varies from US$2.2 billion in Guangdong province to US$1.4 million in Qinghai province. The average indirect economic losses of producers per province were US$467.8 million and 18 provinces suffered losses of between US$100 and US$900 million (Fig. 3). The provinces with high economic losses for producers are mainly located in the eastern coastal, central and southern parts of China. These findings suggest that the ASF epidemic has not only directly hit the swine industry, but almost all economic sectors through its links, leading to considerable economic losses.The total indirect economic losses to producers in all sectors of the Chinese economy (149 sectors) are estimated to have been US$14.5 billion.

        <p>The decrease in consumer surplus caused by the outbreaks of ASF is estimated to be US$84.9 billion. This is more than three times the total production losses (i.e. US$25.9 billion), suggesting the economic losses have mainly come from the decrease in consumer surplus. Finally, the government loss associated with ASF is about US$364 million (see Supplementary Table S2 for the explanation of government costs calculation). Relative to the other economic losses, the government loss is very low (Supplementary Table S3). This suggests that increases in expenditure and investment in the prevention and control of ASF may help to reduce the economic losses for producers and consumers.The decrease in consumer surplus caused by the outbreaks of ASF is estimated to be US$84.9 billion.

        <p>To explore a broad range of future uncertainties and corresponding realities, and shed light on the economic losses likely to be associated with future ASF outbreaks, we conduct a series of sensitivity analyses based on different scenarios.

        <p>From the best-case ( 20 S  ) to the worst-case ( 80 S ) ASF scenario, the direct financial loss to the swine industry ranges from US$9.1 billion to US$20.6 billion, and the total economic loss ranges from US$89.5 billion to US$196.2 billion, accounting for between 0.6% and 1.4% of Chinese GDP in 2019. China has the largest hog herd in the world and accounts for roughly 45% of global pork production 19 . A considerable reduction in the pig population would result in a serious shortage of pork supply, an increase in the demand for and prices of substitute commodities and feed ingredients, and even a change in the diet culture in China, and the impairment of calorie availability and nutrition intake in some underdeveloped areas in the world 13 .From the best-case ( 20 S  ) to the worst-case ( 80 S ) ASF scenario, the direct financial loss to the swine industry ranges from US$9.1 billion to US$20.6 billion, and the total economic loss ranges from US$89.5 billion to US$196.2 billion, accounting for between 0.6% and 1.4% of Chinese GDP in 2019.

        <p>The ASF outbreaks are still ongoing in China and impose lots of uncertainty on pork prices which directly affect pork production and consumer welfare. Our sensitivity analysis on the pork prices shows that from the best-case ( 20 SP  ) to the worst-case ( 80 SP ) ASF scenario, the total economic loss ranges from US 60.6 billion to US 296.9 billion, accounting for between 0.42% and 2.07 % of Chinese GDP in 2019. The price changes mainly impact the consumer surplus and the worst-case could result in a decrease of US211.18 billion in consumer surplus, 2.9 times higher than the reference point.The ASF outbreaks are still ongoing in China and impose lots of uncertainty on pork prices which directly affect pork production and consumer welfare.

        <p>The impact of ASF on people's livelihoods and health and food security is potentially equally disastrous. In 2019, during several important national holidays, the Chinese government repeatedly released 10,000 to 30,000 tonnes of pork from state reserves to secure the meat supply. However, relative to the estimated reduction in pork supply due to ASF (3.67 million tonnes), these released frozen pork reserves represent a negligible amount. A reasonable estimate of the animal-sourced food reserve is essential to improve food safety and consumer welfare, and mitigate disease risks from livestock.The impact of ASF on people's livelihoods and health and food security is potentially equally disastrous.

        <p>Moreover, people's meat-consumption attitudes and behaviours have undergone some changes since the outbreak of ASF. Some people have begun avoiding eating pork because of a lack of correct understanding of the transmission of ASF virus that does not pose a hazard or a risk to humans. Thus, the government has a responsibility to educate the public and help people to face and understand animal diseases.Moreover, people's meat-consumption attitudes and behaviours have undergone some changes since the outbreak of ASF.

        <p>A lack of crucial data is one of the main challenges we faced in this research. Missing data can reduce the statistical power of a study and cause biased estimates, leading to invalid conclusions. Thus, this study uses a substitution indicator approach for handling incomplete/missing data. There is a large gap between the officially stated and actual data on the number of pigs that have died or been culled because of ASF. Estimations should be based on data and information that adequately reflect the true picture. We believe the data gap mainly comes from the following sources: the impaired reproductive capacity due to the reduction in the number of breeding pigs due to deaths and culls; the significant drop in the hog herd supply caused by farmers stopping breeding pigs, and under-reporting in official data collection. The substitution indicator estimation considers and integrates information closely related to the number of slaughtered pigs. Pig feed production is closely related to the number of pigs. Therefore, we use the information on swine feed production reduction and average feed intake for a pig to construct a substitution indicator to proxy for the actual reduction in the number of pigs. This substitution indicator estimation approach will address the incomplete/missing data problem and be very useful for other similar economic evaluations.A lack of crucial data is one of the main challenges we faced in this research.

        <p>Due to the lack of the required official data on abandoned pigs, this study uses an innovative approach for handling incomplete/missing data. As we discussed previously, the actual reduction in the number of pigs due to ASF is unclear. Therefore, we use the difference between swine feed production before and that after the ASF outbreak (i.e yearly feed production reduction) divided by the average yearly feed intake per pig, as the substitution indicator for the total reduction in the number of slaughtered pigs in the estimation interval. The related calculations are as follows:Due to the lack of the required official data on abandoned pigs, this study uses an innovative approach for handling incomplete/missing data.

        <p>Although the IO model can effectively evaluate the impact of a disruption on one sector of an economy, as well as the associated loss assessment for other sectors 24,25 , one of weaknesses of the IO model is that it does not consider the impact of changes in prices.Although the IO model can effectively evaluate the impact of a disruption on one sector of an economy, as well as the associated loss assessment for other sectors 24,25 , one of weaknesses of the IO model is that it does not consider the impact of changes in prices.</p>

It is worth noting here that the curves are ideally estimated using supply and demand elasticities, which would give the actual slope and overall shape of the curves. However, our simplified linear approximation still can give a useful sense of potential impact on the consumers and provide a good estimation..

        <p>In the study, economic losses caused by ASF are evaluated from four aspects: the direct economic losses to the swine industry, the indirect economic losses to all sectors of China's economy, the decrease in consumer surplus and the government loss.

The schematic diagram of the proposed evaluation system is shown in Supplementary Fig.</p>
        <p>The swine industry's direct economic loss includes three components: the economic loss from the culling and removal of infected carcasses, the economic loss due to impaired reproductive capacity caused by the reduced number of breeders, and the economic loss due to the shrinking of the pig supply market. A deterministic calculation and a substitution indicator are applied to estimate the above losses. The industrial structure and food consumption vary across provinces in China. To consider the possible impact of such geographic differences and achieve a more accurate estimation, we estimate each type of economic loss at the province level. These estimations can also provide a scientific decision-making reference for each province to use to make tailored control and prevention policies.The swine industry's direct economic loss includes three components: the economic loss from the culling and removal of infected carcasses, the economic loss due to impaired reproductive capacity caused by the reduced number of breeders, and the economic loss due to the shrinking of the pig supply market.

        <p>The indirect economic loss to all sectors of the economy is estimated based on complete consumption coefficients obtained from the 2017 IO table published by the National Bureau of Statistics of China 20 . A complete consumption coefficient refers to the amounts of products or services of each sector that need to be consumed directly and indirectly (that is, completely consumed) in order for each unit of the final product provided by a specific sector to be produced. See Supplementary Fig. S2 for the indirect influence coefficients of the swine industry on each industry.The indirect economic loss to all sectors of the economy is estimated based on complete consumption coefficients obtained from the 2017 IO table published by the National Bureau of Statistics of China 20 .

        <p>We then estimate the decrease in consumer surplus, which refers to the change of consumer welfare under the pork market's partial equilibrium before and after the outbreaks of ASF. Finally, we assess the government loss, which refers to the government's emergency expenditure on controlling and extinguishing the epidemic, S2 for details.We then estimate the decrease in consumer surplus, which refers to the change of consumer welfare under the pork market's partial equilibrium before and after the outbreaks of ASF.
