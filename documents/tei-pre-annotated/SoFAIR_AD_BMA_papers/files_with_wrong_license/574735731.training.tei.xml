        <p>After more than three years, we start to see the end of the tunnel of the COVID-19 pandemic and are ready for reopening (Abbass et al., 2022; Suh and Alhaerym, 2022;Kumar et al., 2021). Here, the Guest Editors and Co-Editors would like to wish all of our readers and authors good health and let us walk through the pandemic together. We continue to present Part 3 of our Special Issue on the COVID-19 Pandemic and Health Informatics in this issue. In the past two parts (Huang et al. 2020(Huang et al. , 2021)), we presented 28 papers; in this issue, we present the following 14 papers on three aspects of research.</p>
        <p>Through bibliometric analysis and related techniques, researchers can gain insight into a particular research area's trends and essential elements. Continuing from the efforts of previous special issues on this topic (</p>
        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic makes us develop, design, and adjust many existing procedures and operations of public services to accommodate social distancing and related public health concerns. We have several papers discussing the difficulties and challenges these public services face. In this issue, Zhang et al. (2023) studied factors making Chinese citizens' dissatisfied with government services. They suggested government departments should be more patient with citizens, increase the speed of handling complaints, and shorten the appeal processing time. Meng et al. (2023), on the other hand, studied the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the operations of public museums in Hong Kong through interviews developed based on the PEST (Political, Economic, Social, Technology) and AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) models with museum staff and visitors. They discussed and highlighted the new practices of museums developed through digital transformation.</p>
        <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, people were asked to have home quarantine, take vaccination (Li et al., 2022;Mir et al., 2022;Thanh et al., 2022), and use contact-tracing apps (Ho et al., 2023;Nguyen et al., 2022;Rocha et al., 2021). This situation made people stressed and affected people's well-being (Av√ßin and Can, 2022). Ye and Ho (2023) studied the relationship between generalized trust and psychological well-being in college students in Japan before and during the pandemic. They showed the pandemic changed their communication behaviors. Nguyen et al. (2023) also studied contacttracing apps in Vietnam and noted people's privacy concerns offset the perceived benefits of using such apps. On the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic also increased people's stress and anxiety. For example, when most children were asked to stay home and study online, parents faced the stress of helping their kids study online (Wang et al., 2023).</p>
        <p>When facing this uncertain period, people relied more on information available online and on social media to get the latest development of the pandemic. While people understand the importance of information quality at this critical juncture (Wu et al., 2022;Nguyen and Le, 2021;Hasan et al., 2021), much misinformation may be spread on the Internet and traditional media (Naveed et al., 2021;Ho et al., 2022). Nabi et al. (2023) reported their finding from data collected in Bangladesh, which showed how to use social capital to establish trust between people and healthcare facilities through social media. Soroya and Faiola (2023) also studied the impact of information sources on the information-seeking behavior of the Pakistani Z generation and showed that they felt information from conventional media caused them information overload and information from social media and personal networks caused them information anxiety. Lastly, Yi and Chiu (2023) conducted a qualitative study to summarize public information needs in mainland China during the pandemic.</p>
        <p>Readers may note many new information behavior patterns have become more common. For example, mainland Chinese may consider not just browsing and searching on platforms like Zhihu but also paying for knowledge there (Feng et al., 2022). Also, telemedicine is getting more common to avoid further infections (Rahi, 2022). Readers may also be interested in our recent special issue on "Data for better health" (Wu and Yu, 2020). We hope our readers enjoy our selection for this special issue and wish our community good health and safety.</p>
