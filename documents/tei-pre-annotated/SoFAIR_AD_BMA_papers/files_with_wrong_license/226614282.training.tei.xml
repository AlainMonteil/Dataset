        <p>The concept of servitization is well established in the literature, and yet the processes of organisational change that manufacturers undergo to compete through services have received much less attention. Therefore, this paper develops a model that enables a description of the servitization processes, the principal stages of organisational change, and the forces impacting these processes. It is based on a series of 14 case studies of the process of servitization over time in multinational manufacturers. Evidence and analysis from these cases are used to establish that manufacturers undergo four stages of organisational maturity (Exploration, Engagement, Expansion and Exploitation), through which an organisation progresses according to the pressures of five principal forces (customer pull, technology push, value network positioning, organisational readiness, and organisational commitment). This progression can be characterised as a business growth model with multiple crises or tipping points. This research contributes to our understanding of the process of servitization and proposes a model which can be used to explain progression. It also forms the basis to better prepare manufacturers as to what to expect as they embark on a servitization journey.The concept of servitization is well established in the literature, and yet the processes of organisational change that manufacturers undergo to compete through services have received much less attention.

        <p>Servitization continues to be a topic of growing importance and interest to both the research and practice communities. For both, an overriding challenge is to understand and manage the transformation processes that manufacturing companies must undergo to compete through services rather than through products alone (Kowalkowski et al., 2017b, Baines et al., 2017). These transformation processes may be wide ranging and complex, often requiring significant organisational change involving operating processes, capabilities, and platforms (Martinez et al., 2017). Yet, despite numerous successful examples such as Goodyear's Proactive Solutions, MAN Truck &amp; Buses Drivers' Behaviour Monitoring, and Volvo Construction's Proactive Monitoring and Maintenance, many firms struggle to successfully servitize (Lütjen et al., 2017). This study, therefore, examines the processes by which manufacturers transform to compete through services, giving special attention to the more advanced services. It seeks to understand and characterise how a manufacturing organisation changes and matures in introducing, designing, and delivering services.Servitization continues to be a topic of growing importance and interest to both the research and practice communities.

        <p>Much of the preceding servitization research has examined the content, and to some extent its relationship with the context (see Pettigrew, 1988), of organisational change within manufacturing firms, in other words, what have manufacturers changed and what were the circumstances when these changes occurred? (Baines et al., 2017). Much less attention has been given to the process of organisational change through servitization and how this is impacted by the context; in other words: how did (or should) change occur and what the circumstances were (or should be) when change occurs. The absence of research in this area has been noted by Martinez et al. (2017), Lütjen et al. (2017), and Kowalkowski et al. (2017b). All highlight the limitations in our knowledge of the change process arguing that, despite the prevalence of services amongst manufacturing firms, many struggle to understand and manage the transition from product-centric to services-centric businesses. Knowledge about the interplay of environmental factors is also lacking (Baines andShi, 2015, Brax andVisintin, 2017). Indeed, Finne et al. (2013) draw attention to the need to study how contextual factors affect the change process, and that transition can be slow and cautious because of such factors.Much of the preceding servitization research has examined the content, and to some extent its relationship with the context (see Pettigrew, 1988), of organisational change within manufacturing firms, in other words, what have manufacturers changed and what were the circumstances when these changes occurred?

        <p>Researchers are now responding to this opportunity. In particular, Martinez et al. (2017) have studied three diverse organisations and argue that the change process is best explained by the theory of continuous change; while Lütjen et al. (2017) interviewed senior managers across 14 firms in the energy sector to suggest that innovation theory describes the servitization process.Researchers are now responding to this opportunity.

        <p>Overall, these researchers agree that the change process is complex and loosely structured, that there is still much to learn, and that fulfilling this need is best achieved through a broad, in-depth and longitudinal study of a range of manufacturers (Vendrell-Herrero et al., 2014).Overall, these researchers agree that the change process is complex and loosely structured, that there is still much to learn, and that fulfilling this need is best achieved through a broad, in-depth and longitudinal study of a range of manufacturers (Vendrell-Herrero et al., 2014).</p>
        <p>The study described in this paper, therefore, explores the organisational change process brought about by servitization and how this is impacted by business contextual factors. As explained in the paper, this is based on multiple case studies across 14 multinational manufacturing firms engaging with servitization, with aspirations to compete through advanced services. Data is captured from a range of expert witnesses from all levels within these organisations. These case studies and their analyses have been guided by three research questions which examine: (i) the rationalisation of this process into stages or steps, (ii) the interplay of contextual factors, and (iii) the characteristics of the change process and the theory describing this process. Our analysis leads to three key findings and contributions to servitization research and practice.The study described in this paper, therefore, explores the organisational change process brought about by servitization and how this is impacted by business contextual factors.

        <p>First, that at an aggregated level, the process of organisational change through servitization can be explained as four macro-stages: Exploration, Engagement, Expansion and Exploitation. Second, that progression both between and within these macro-stages is significantly influenced by contextual factors, which can be grouped into five categories relating to the customer, technology, the value network, organisational readiness, and the commitment of the host business. Third, that while progression from one macro-stage to the next does appear as structured and predominantly unidirectional, within these are sub-processes which are characteristically organic, unstructured and iterative, and so the whole process can be characterised as a business growth model with multiple crises or tipping points. These three insights are drawn together to form a model (the servitization progression model) that represents how the process of organisational change unfolds as a manufacturer undertakes a servitization journey.First, that at an aggregated level, the process of organisational change through servitization can be explained as four macro-stages: Exploration, Engagement, Expansion and Exploitation.

        <p>Overall, this study moves forward our understanding of the process of servitization. In particular, it builds on the studies by Martinez et al. (2017) and Lütjen et al. (2017) by understanding how relevant contextual factors affect the servitization process, and reconciling how servitization can be explained theoretically. In addition, it brings together the notions that (i) servitization is a unidirectional and linear shift from products to product-service offerings (Turunen and Finne, 2014), with (ii) the servitization process being neither logical nor structured (Martinez et al., 2017). This study establishes that both characteristics (i.e. unidirectional and unstructured) may be exhibited in practice by a business, depending on the level of aggregation at which the change processes are viewed (i.e. at a macro-level the servitization process may appear to progress linearly, yet the underpinning sub-processes are likely to be unstructured and iterative). From a practical perspective, this understanding better prepares managers to appreciate the likely characteristics of a servitization programme and how this will unfold in practice.Overall, this study moves forward our understanding of the process of servitization.

        <p>Servitization is commonly taken to be a transition or transformation which is largely characterised as a linear and gradual move along a product continuum from less to more sophisticated services (Lutjen et al., 2017, andOliva andKallenberg, 2003). Such conceptualisation implies a direct relationship between service offerings and the extent of servitization. This is an established view (see Mont (2004), Tukker (2004), Martinez et al. (2010) and Gaiardelli et al. (2014)), and is similar to the notion that a firm's service transformation can be assessed by the number of its service offerings (see Mathieu (2001), Raddats and Burton (2011), Ulaga and Reinartz (2011)). Other researchers, however, see such relationships between service offerings and the extent of servitization as more blurred (see Raddats and Kowalkowski (2014), Windahl and Lakemond (2010)) and that a manufacturer may have a latent capability to offer services, though the commercial environment may limit their saleability and success. These reservations are largely addressed by taking servitization to be the innovation of an organisation's capabilities and processes, and that, generally, the extent of servitization can be assessed in terms of the sophistication of services offered (Baines et al., 2009).Servitization is commonly taken to be a transition or transformation which is largely characterised as a linear and gradual move along a product continuum from less to more sophisticated services (Lutjen et al., 2017, andOliva andKallenberg, 2003).

        <p>Service sophistication varies on the level of risk, competition, and potential to create competitive advantages (Oliva andKallenberg, 2003, andEggert et al., 2014). Services can be categorised as either base services (warranties and spare parts), intermediate services (maintenance, repair, overhaul) and advanced services (Baines and Lightfoot, 2013). Advanced services are complex value propositions whereby the manufacturer focuses on providing performance outcomes to customers, and can be thought of as substituting services (Cusumano et al., 2015) that replace the purchase of the product (Paiola et al., 2013). Iconic examples of these include MAN's Pay-per-Kilometre (Bustinza et al., 2015), which offers comprehensive services around drivers' behaviour and fuel efficiency based on the distance the company's trucks are driven. Such services are also known as Pay-per-Use contracts (Martinez et al., 2017), Outcome-based Contracts (Kowalkowski et al., 2009, Batista et al., 2017), Performance-based Contracts (Kindström and Kowalkowski, 2014) and Capability Contracts (Gebauer et al., 2011). Advanced services are, therefore, a convenient categorisation of more sophisticated services, and have been chosen as the focus for this study.Service sophistication varies on the level of risk, competition, and potential to create competitive advantages (Oliva andKallenberg, 2003, andEggert et al., 2014).

        <p>This study deals with the servitization of the manufacturing firm. A common perception is that servitization is confined to manufacturing, though this is not necessarily the case (Kawalowski et al., 2017, Vandermerwe andRada, 1988), and service sector companies can also servitize by increasing the bundling of their service offerings. This distinction here is important as the servitization process may differ based on the form of the host organisation. In a similar vein, it is important to recognise that manufacturing firms may go in the opposite direction and move away from service provision. This is the process of deservitization and occurs when a firm reduces or curtails service provision; indeed the interplay between servitization and deservitization is not yet well understood and deserves closer examination (Valtakoski, 2017, Kowalkowski et al., 2017a).This study deals with the servitization of the manufacturing firm.

        <p>Servitization can, therefore, be taken as the transition or transformation towards advanced services (Lutjen et al., 2017, andOliva andKallenberg, 2003). Yet, this opens questions as to whether it is most appropriate to describe the process of servitization as 'transitional' (Oliva and Kallenberg, 2003) or 'transformational' (Vendrell-Herrero et al., 2014). Although the term transition is perhaps most dominant in the literature, these terms are frequently interchanged and often taken to mean the same. Yet, there are two types of assumptions in the prevalent literature: either companies move away from products into services, or companies extend or expand their coverage (Finne et al., 2013). The term transition does suggest more of a shift from one state to a second 'Goods to Services', while transformation allows for an extension, where the second state embraces the first 'Goods and Services'. In this sense, IBM demonstrated a transition in moving from producing products to supplying services, whereas Rolls-Royce demonstrated a transformation by expansion of its product portfolio to include services. In this study, we embrace both transformation and transition. However, throughout the paper, we will favour the term transformation, both for brevity in the text and because it suggests a more inclusive approach to servitization.Servitization can, therefore, be taken as the transition or transformation towards advanced services (Lutjen et al., 2017, andOliva andKallenberg, 2003).

        <p>Given that our chosen definition of servitization focuses on manufacturing organisations, and the innovation of these organisations to offer advanced services, then in this context, transformation is concerned with the processes of organisational change. Organisational change occurs as an interplay between the context, process and content (Pettigrew, 1988, Whipp et al., 1989, Pye and Pettigrew, 2005). Context deals with the circumstances of change (internal and external to organisations), while process deals with how change takes place, and content deals with the actual decisions reached. According to Baines et al. (2017), there is now a relatively well-established body of content-focused research on servitization (e.g., co-design processes (Durugbo, 2014), customer-supplier relationships (Kohtamäki et al., 2013a, Selviaridis andNorrman, 2014), buying processes (Lindberg and Nordin, 2008), network structures/configurations (Ziaee Bigdeli et al., 2018, Kohtamäki et al., 2013b, Nordin et al., 2013, Chakkol et al., 2014, Bikfalvi et al., 2013), and complex networks (Finne et al., 2015). By contrast far less attention has been given to the process aspects of organisational change associated with servitization (Martinez et al., 2017, Brax and Visintin 2017, Kowalkowski et al. 2017b) and, in particular, how this interplays with contextual factors (Baines et al., 2017, Dmitrijeva et al., 2018). Exploring this topic in-depth is, therefore, the focus of this study.Given that our chosen definition of servitization focuses on manufacturing organisations, and the innovation of these organisations to offer advanced services, then in this context, transformation is concerned with the processes of organisational change.

        <p>Studies about process differ as to whether they focus on 'describing' the transformation process that manufacturers have followed or 'prescribing' how to go about servitization and change management (see Judson (1991), Kotter (1995), Galpin (1996), Armenakis and Bedeian (1999), and Armenakis et al. (2000)). The former suggests a reflective study and capturing a description of the decisions and actions of a manufacturer as the servitization journey unfolds; while the latter is concerned with prescribing a set of analyses and actions that can be followed to guide servitization. Practitioners are especially interested in this latter case, and yet for such prescriptions to be reliable, they should be founded on a thorough understanding and evidence of the former. In this regard, therefore, this study focuses on capturing the transformation that manufacturers have followed (i.e. descriptive).Studies about process differ as to whether they focus on 'describing' the transformation process that manufacturers have followed or 'prescribing' how to go about servitization and change management (see Judson (1991), Kotter (1995), Galpin (1996), Armenakis and Bedeian (1999), and Armenakis et al.

        <p>There is only limited reporting of the step-by-step service journeys of individual firms (Vendrell-Herrero et al., 2014). Martinez et al. (2017) argue that service-driven transformation requires the reconfiguration of fundamental elements of the product-service offering, organisation and value network, and that such change processes may unfold over a number of phases of emergence, development, implementation and diffusion (Hargrave and Van de Ven, 2006). In their review of servitization literature, Brax and Visintin (2017) discuss stepwise progression models that identify progressive stages of increasing servitization. They note that stepwise models are particularly important, as these indicate stages and form the basis for analysing how the servitization process unfolds, although they also caution against an assumption of the servitization process as unidirectional. On this basis, Lütjen et al. (2017) suggest that early stages tend to be based on already existing products, resources and technologies (Oliva and Kallenberg, 2003), while later stages require substantial changes in the underlying technologies and competences, and in the customer value and behaviours in a greater extent.There is only limited reporting of the step-by-step service journeys of individual firms (Vendrell-Herrero et al., 2014).

        <p>Stages or steps are common in prescriptive models, and one of the best-known change management models is that of Kotter and Cohen (2002). Their model consists of eight steps to be followed when implementing fundamental changes: (i) establishing a sense of urgency; (ii) forming a powerful coalition of individuals; (iii) creating a vision and strategy; (iv) communicating the vision; (v) empowering others to act; (vi) creating short-term wins; (vii) consolidating improvements; and (viii) anchoring the new approaches. Such work has its roots in the primary model proposed by Lewin (1947), which consists of unfreezing, moving, and freezing phases. Building on this, Judson (1991), Kotter (1995), Galpin (1996), Armenakis and Bedeian (1999), Armenakis et al. (2000), and Kotter and Cohen (2002) have all proposed multi-staged models to be followed in implementing changes as an organisation's commitment and progress develops. In particular, they extend the Kotter (1995) model to include: (i) readiness for change, and (ii) dealing with resistance when executing a change management programme.Stages or steps are common in prescriptive models, and one of the best-known change management models is that of Kotter and Cohen (2002).

        <p>Stages are also common in models describing organisational change. Scott and Bruce (1987) develop a model of organisational transformation and growth, which is based on the classical product life-cycle stages. These are (i) inception (which focuses on the idea development), (ii) survival and growth (which focuses on gaining backing), (iii) expansion (which focuses on organisational structures), and (iv) maturity (which focuses on stability). However, both descriptive and prescriptive models emphasise two key points: (i) the change process typically occurs in multiple steps that take a considerable amount of time to unfold, and efforts to bypass steps seldom yield a satisfactory result, and (ii) mistakes in any step can slow implementation as well as negate hard-won progress. These insights lead to our first question about the change process.Stages are also common in models describing organisational change.

Those that have can be subdivided into two broad groups: the first dealing with the more strategic and holistic aspects of organisational change, and the second focusing on operational and tactical levels. The former is characterised by Kowalkowski et al. (2017a), who examine how agile leadership within a manufacturer impacts the service growth route. An example of the latter is Eloranta and Turunen (2016), who provide a rationale for using platform approaches in the manufacturing context and demonstrate how complex inter-organisational relationships impact value creation processes in service networks.Table 1 illustrates that, predominantly, studies focus on relationships between context (internal &amp; external) and content.

        <p>These differing views of transformation are reflected in the broader literature on organisational change, which is dominated by two approaches: (i) continuous change and (ii) punctuated equilibrium. The continuous change approach emphases a situation where organisations and their people continually monitor, sense, and respond to the external and internal environment in small steps as an ongoing process (Luecke, 2003). Burnes (2004) identifies continuous change as the ability to change continuously in a fundamental manner. The theory of continuous change suggests that change is not episodic but endemic to the way in which organisations operate, having the ability to engage in rapid and relentless continuous change (Langley et al., 2013). By contrast, punctuated equilibrium is characterised by long periods of relative peacefulness with small, incremental changes that are interrupted by brief periods of discontinuous and radical change (Tushman and Anderson, 1986). There are other frameworks that also explain this organisational change process. In particular, Scott and Bruce (1987) propose a model of business growth that somewhat reconciles the differences between linear growth and radical change. (2017), having interviewed senior managers across 14 firms in the energy sector, suggest that the innovation management perspective also explains the organisational change process. This leads us to conclude that further work is necessary in this area and leads to our final research question.These differing views of transformation are reflected in the broader literature on organisational change, which is dominated by two approaches: (i) continuous change and (ii) punctuated equilibrium.

        <p>This study set out to illuminate the transformation process that a product-centric manufacturer undertakes as it servitizes to compete through advanced services. Given the nature of the research questions, this paper has adopted a multiple case study approach that allows the examination of replication logic (Yin, 2003), a condition in which empirical analyses can be seen as a series of independent experiments that confirm or disconfirm conceptual insights as they emerge (Eisenhardt, 1989). This section describes the case selection as well as the data collection and analysis methods.This study set out to illuminate the transformation process that a product-centric manufacturer undertakes as it servitizes to compete through advanced services.

For example, early experimentation with an outcome-based contract or developing a services-led offering were considered to be positive indicators.

Following this process, 14 company cases were identified and preliminarily engaged by August 2014. For all cases, negotiations concerning access and confidentiality were carried out, and, therefore, the names of the manufacturing organisations have been coded (Case A through to Case N).

        <p>Interviews directly reflected the research questions, and were designed to guide the conversation flow towards a characterisation of servitization initiatives over time, focusing on process, as well as the contextual forces affecting progress towards increased servitization maturity. At least two researchers were present at each interview, and responses were captured by both audio recording and written notes. Each interview lasted from one to two hours. Overall, the study conducted 62 rounds of interviews, with at least three key stakeholders from each case company, resulting in more than 100 hours of recorded material. Written transcripts were prepared soon after each interview. Triangulation (Jick, 1979) was carried out to verify responses and included supplementary data, such as observation notes, organisational charts, process maps, operating protocols, and crosschecked responses from interviewees.Interviews directly reflected the research questions, and were designed to guide the conversation flow towards a characterisation of servitization initiatives over time, focusing on process, as well as the contextual forces affecting progress towards increased servitization maturity.

        <p>We followed the principles of qualitative data analysis (Miles and Huberman, 1994) to describe, interpret and categorise the data. The key mechanisms for generating meaning from the data were noting patterns, seeing plausibility, clustering, making contrasts/comparisons, and subsuming particulars into the general (Miles and Huberman, 1994). We first performed within-case analysis, starting by organising the data around each of the research questions. We coded the data against the research questions, while simultaneously allowing for new codes and relationships to emerge inductively from the data. In order to ensure reliability and construct validity, the data was coded by two independent researchers and different interpretations of the data (e.g. classification of codes into broader conceptual categories) were discussed vis-à-vis raw data to arrive at a consensual coding. We then performed cross-case analysis by summarising the data from each case and building displays to reveal cross-case patterns and make comparisons. Validity was further enhanced by identifying commonalities across cases, as well as by comparing cases with different levels of progression in servitization over time (Yin, 2003). Finally, we presented our findings (stages and their timing, and key contextual factors affecting progression and reconstructed pathways) to informants in each case to assess plausibility (Yin, 2003).We followed the principles of qualitative data analysis (Miles and Huberman, 1994) to describe, interpret and categorise the data.

        <p>The data was coded to identify the significant actions or events associated with the servitization process over time in each case (as per the interviewees' accounts and other sources of data). The codes were then used to build a timeline for each case. To illustrate, Figure 2 shows the timeline for Case A. We then iteratively analysed the servitization events within and across cases against the lenses of the different change models discussed in Section 2.4, grouping actions/events according to their conceptual similarity. Four conceptual categories of events in the transformation process became apparent. We found that, in each case, the events associated with each category clustered around a well-delimited time period, thus constituting different stages of maturity. In addition, each stage exhibited similar features across firms. These stages were well aligned with the four stages described in the model of organisational change proposed by Scott and Bruce (1987). The terminology and definitions of the stages were revised to better represent the servitization and advanced services context: Exploration, Engagement, Expansion, and Exploitation. By looking at the nature of the events grouped under a given stage we produced an abstract description for each stage.The data was coded to identify the significant actions or events associated with the servitization process over time in each case (as per the interviewees' accounts and other sources of data).

We found that, in each case, the events associated with each category clustered around a well-delimited time period, thus constituting different stages of maturity. In addition, each stage exhibited similar features across firms. These stages were well aligned with the four stages described in the model of organisational change proposed by Scott and Bruce (1987). The terminology and definitions of the stages were revised to better represent the servitization and advanced services context: Exploration, Engagement, Expansion, and Exploitation. By looking at the nature of the events grouped under a given stage we produced an abstract description for each stage.</p>

        <p>Table 3. Characterisation of the four stages of servitization maturity Table 4 shows for each case the predominant incidence over time of traits associated with the four stages. It reveals that all firms seem to follow the same sequence, though not all companies had managed to progress through each stage at the time of the research. In addition, there is no evidence that firms skipped stages. Overall, the data supports the existence of the four stages in servitization journeys. This conceptualisation of the transformation process as four stages provides a viable structure for differentiating the progress of the case companies. In the first phase of Exploration, all the case companies were looking to understand their market and explore how advanced services could play a key part in their growth. For instance, the CEO of Case F explained: 'We started to explore what are the pain points of our customerswe found that it wasn't the price of the truck at all; it was the cost of fuel as well as uptime … we started to realise we can do a lot to address those pains.' Similarly, the Business Development Manager of Case K said, 'We started to be aware of the requirements and needs of our customers through a reverse engineer initiative, it feels like "by the way you'll need one of those, and one of those, and one of those.Table 3.

        <p>We analysed the data based on first-order and second-order coding (Strauss andCorbin, 1998, Miles andHuberman, 1994). We started by coding the data (mainly interview data) for incidents or phenomena that constituted an evidence (or manifestation) of a contextual factor shaping the transformation process, assigning a code to each. Then we grouped these factors into aggregate second-order conceptual factors. Establishing a second-order factor required the existence of at least two conceptually related first-order incidents associated with different data sources (e.g., two different respondents). For example, appetite from customer base to experiment new innovations, and commitments from key customers to engage in experimentation projects were grouped under customer pull. Since the literature is scarce on contextual factors pertaining to the servitization process (see Section 2.3), this was primarily an inductive process. The process as a whole was iterative, involving the revision of the definitions of the second-order factors to arrive at a comprehensive and consistent set of factors.We analysed the data based on first-order and second-order coding (Strauss andCorbin, 1998, Miles andHuberman, 1994).

        <p>Value network positioning refers to the external context factors about the value network structure that affect the progression. We found diverse examples in the cases. In Cases F and N, the distributors were observed to restrict access to customers, field service facilities and improvements in performance to such an extent that they were acquired. Case I failed to progress beyond the Engagement stage because the distributor inhibited customer interaction, which the management of Case I failed to navigate. Somewhat similar situations occurred around the access to remote sensing technologies, as illustrated by Case F, which for some time wrestled with the decision to acquire a technology vendor in order to increase access to and control of information about truck fleets. All these cases provide evidence supporting the significant influence of positioning in the value network that delivers dependable access to both customers and suppliers.Value network positioning refers to the external context factors about the value network structure that affect the progression.

        <p>Organisational readiness refers to the internal context factors about the organisation that affect whether or not the process starts. Particularly evident in the cases was the effect of the basic reliability and performance of the manufacturer's existing products. For example, Cases A, F, and G all indicated that their product platforms were entirely reliable, so that their interest in advanced services stemmed, in part, from product reliability and performance that were no longer differentiators. The CEO of Case F stated: 'Unless you manufacture a reliable asset, you will have no place in the advanced services space … we build a reliable truck, so we can provide a platform of services.' In contrast, Case I was unable to reach an acceptable pace in its transformation journey because its products were not sufficiently reliable to form a platform for advanced services.

        <p>Organisational commitment refers to the common internal factors that act across all stages and focuses on the key capabilities that enable or inhibit the progression. Organisational commitment has been widely acknowledged as a key success factor for any change efforts (Kotter andCohen, 2002, Burnes, 2004). Case H, for instance, progressed relatively quickly through the Exploration and Engagement stages because it had the support of the management board. In contrast, Case G failed to move through the Engagement stage because it lacked internal support.

        <p>Table 4 showed that all the firms seemed to follow the same sequence of four stages and there is no evidence that stages are skipped. Moreover, the individual case timelines (see Figure 2 for an example) showed that the events/actions associated with each stage were clustered around well-delimited time periods. Although in some cases there was some time overlap of events belonging to different stages, this overlap was short and confined to the transition period between stages. We also did not find evidence of actions/events belonging to the previous stage beyond the short transition period. Thus, at an aggregated level, the process appears to be structured and predominantly unidirectional.Table 4 showed that all the firms seemed to follow the same sequence of four stages and there is no evidence that stages are skipped.

        <p>However, the qualitative analysis of the dynamics of change also revealed that, within stages, there were sub-processes which were organic, unstructured and iterative. By looking at the transition periods, we also found evidence of tipping points between stages. These are triggered when the case for support is sufficiently strong, whether in terms of personal conviction or organisational permission, so that consent is achieved to move on to the following transformation stage. Companies would switch from Exploration to Engagement only when senior management became confident that a viable business opportunity existed; from Engagement to Expansion only when the potential of advanced services was accepted within the organisation; from Expansion to Exploitation only when significant value was demonstrated within the organisation. As illustrated by Cases G, I, L and M which did not move beyond the Engagement stage, not all companies had a sufficiently strong case to overcome the tipping points. Within the stages, multiple reiterations of decisions and actions took place until such tipping conditions prevail -that the transformation process 'tips' and moves on to the following stage. In the case studies, once the process had moved on to a new stage, it did not return to the preceding stage unless some form of relatively catastrophic change took place within the business.

        <p>The unstructured nature of the sub-processes was strongly influenced by the confluence of different contextual factors (see Table 5), which affected the detailed activities carried out by the firms. Case B, for example, was initially pulled by its customers into delivering advanced services. The strength of this pull was such that it affected the activities with which it engaged for instance, it was not necessary to scan and analyse the market sector to identify relevant customers. Rather, the challenges centred more on developing the organisational conviction to take this opportunity, along with putting in place technologies to enable delivery of its advanced services. The situation for Case F, as another example, was different. By his nature, the company CEO was inquisitive about technology and how it might be exploited. He was introduced to one of the leading telematics providers, and the two companies collaborated closely to experiment on ways in which technology systems might enable Case F to develop and deliver advanced services. Case F experimented with, for example, having its own rental fleet to develop a proposition that could then be taken to market. Unlike Case B, it was necessary for Case F to scan, identify and engage customers. However, where Case B had to formally engage in joint ventures and acquisitions to enhance its technological capabilities and create its engine health management systems, Case F had implicitly moved through many of these decisions. Case A's initial driver was on of the senior personnel in the innovation team that were exploring ways to inspire growth, and came to recognise that business model innovation around advanced services could provide a possible route. Case A's interest was influenced by the growing attention to services by its key competitors. Consequently, it had to engage in a range of activities, from developing and experimenting with customer value propositions through to deciding on relationships with technology suppliers.

        <p>The servitization progression model explains how the servitization journey unfolds through four distinctive stages of organisational maturity, in accordance with five sets of internal and external forces. At a macro-level, progression from stage to stage appears linear and unidirectional; yet, within each stage, activities to progress servitization are organic, intuitive and repetitive. Progress from one macro-level stage to the next is punctuated by tipping points, which are only overcome once the activities of the preceding stage demonstrate sufficient value that the organisation consents to progression to the following stage. So significant are these tipping points that progression is not guaranteed, and under certain conditions the servitization journey may stall or even fail entirely. Overall, this process can be characterised as a business growth model.The servitization progression model explains how the servitization journey unfolds through four distinctive stages of organisational maturity, in accordance with five sets of internal and external forces.

        <p>The rate of progression is determined by five sets of forces. While organisational readiness seems to be present only in the first two stages, the other forces are present across the four stages. It is helpful to reflect how these forces typically interplay on the process. For instance, transformation only effectively begins if there is sufficient organisational readiness (i.e. reliable products, robust processes, etc.). Then the progression is significantly affected by the prevailing organisational commitment (i.e. management buy-in, resource availability, awareness of competitors, etc.). Working around these internal forces are the external forces of customer pull (i.e. customers requesting services, strong relationships, etc.), technology push (i.e. the availability of and access to digital technologies, etc.), and the value network positioning (i.e. relationships with distributors, dealers and vendors). These five forces interplay and collectively determine progress.The rate of progression is determined by five sets of forces.

Then the progression is significantly affected by the prevailing organisational commitment (i.e. management buy-in, resource availability, awareness of competitors, etc.). Working around these internal forces are the external forces of customer pull (i.e. customers requesting services, strong relationships, etc.), technology push (i.e. the availability of and access to digital technologies, etc.), and the value network positioning (i.e. relationships with distributors, dealers and vendors). These five forces interplay and collectively determine progress.</p>
        <p>The servitization progression model explains the experience of practitioners within manufacturing firms typically in the following way.

        <p>The first finding from this study is that at an aggregated level the of organisational change through servitization can be explained as four macro-stages: Exploration, Engagement, Expansion and Exploitation. This is largely consistent with the work of Lütjen et al. (2017) who identify the three steps of (i) service initiation, (ii) service anchoring and (iii) service extension, and these align with the Exploration, Engagement and Expansion stages. In the study described here, Exploitation is teased out as an additional stage, and this is attributed to our particular focus on servitization towards advanced services, and observing that some cases (e.g., Case B) have largely absorbed business improvement activities typical of this stage.The first finding from this study is that at an aggregated level the of organisational change through servitization can be explained as four macro-stages: Exploration, Engagement, Expansion and Exploitation.

        <p>There are more striking differences to the work of Martinez et al. (2017), who identify seven steps, along with limited commonality and considerable iterations. This difference is explainable by the different level of aggregation adopted in the study, and which is consistent with that suggested by Scott and Bruce (1987). In this way, our first finding emphasises the value of a higher level of aggregation (as per Lütjen et al. (2017)) for rationalising the servitization process as a manageable concept.There are more striking differences to the work of Martinez et al.

        <p>The second finding is that progression both between and within these macro-stages is significantly influenced by contextual factors. These can be grouped into five categories relating to customer pull, technology push, value network positioning, organisational readiness, and organisational commitment. It has been known for some time that contextual factors are central to shaping organisational transformation and progress towards servitization (Finne et al., 2013, Cusumano et al., 2015). Indeed, various works have looked at the barriers to servitization, particularly in terms of content (what have manufacturers sought to change?) (i.e., Baines and Shi, 2015). However, by establishing a holistic set of factors and categorising these as key influencers in the process of servitization, this paper provides the foundation to delve deeper into the factors in each category and their influence on detailed decisions within the process.The second finding is that progression both between and within these macro-stages is significantly influenced by contextual factors.

        <p>The third finding is that, while progression from one macro-stage to the next appears as structured and predominantly unidirectional, within these are sub-processes which are characteristically organic, unstructured and iterative. This reconciles notions that: (i) servitization is a unidirectional and linear shift from products to product-service offerings (Turunen and Finne, 2014), and that (ii) the servitization process is neither logical nor structured (Martinez et al., 2017). In their work Martinez et al., describe how they observed that 'the chronological order of steps differs from journey to journey'. Likewise, Kowalkowski et al. (2017b:15) suggest evolutionary stages and 'tentative steps of trial and error'. Yet, the more general literature on organisational change and innovation demonstrates that process stages, iterations and key decision points can be approximately organised and ordered (see Section 2.3). Our study builds on this understanding and demonstrates that both sets of characteristics can be exhibited, depending on the level of aggregation at which the process is viewed (i.e. at a macro-level the process stages appear as a progression; yet the processes within these stages are unstructured and iterative). This is aligned with the business growth model developed by Scott and Bruce (1987) that comprises of multiple crises or tipping points, and helps to explain how the process of organisational change unfolds as a manufacturer undertakes the servitization journey.The third finding is that, while progression from one macro-stage to the next appears as structured and predominantly unidirectional, within these are sub-processes which are characteristically organic, unstructured and iterative.

        <p>The principal contribution of this study is a series of propositions, represented collectively as the servitization progression model, which describes the transformation process that takes place as a product-centric manufacturer servitizes to compete through advanced services. This model shows that the transformation process comprises four principal stages of organisational maturity, through which the manufacturer proceeds according to the pressures of five principal forces. This contribution has both theoretical and practical implications.The principal contribution of this study is a series of propositions, represented collectively as the servitization progression model, which describes the transformation process that takes place as a product-centric manufacturer servitizes to compete through advanced services.

        <p>A recent review by Raddats et al. (2019) emphasises that there are still some fundamental aspects of servitization that warrant further research. Primarily, this paper answers the call for further research on the process and stages of organisational transformation towards servitization (Martinez et al., 2017), along with addressing the limited attention given to contextual factors (Baines et al., 2017). It establishes that: (i) the process of organisational change through servitization can be explained as the four macro-stages of Exploration, Engagement, Expansion and Exploitation, (ii) progression both between and within these macro-stages is significantly influenced by contextual factors, which can be grouped into five categories relating to markets, technology, organisational readiness, organisational commitment and the value network of the host business, and (iii) progression from one macrostage to the next appears as structured and predominantly unidirectional, punctuated by multiple tipping points; but within these stages are sub-processes that are characteristically organic, unstructured and iterative. The whole process can be characterised as a business growth model.A recent review by Raddats et al.

        <p>Servitization can involve a raft of challenges for those executives from a production-centric background, especially for those faced with the task of evaluating and potentially implementing this concept within their organisation. This study has shown that a servitization programme will typically unfold through four stages of organisational change (exploration, engagement, expansion and exploitation) in accordance with a range of contextual factors, in which the factors and stages will interplay, and this will result in an iterative process with critical points where progress can stall.Servitization can involve a raft of challenges for those executives from a production-centric background, especially for those faced with the task of evaluating and potentially implementing this concept within their organisation.

        <p>Executives should find it particularly helpful to understand the characteristics of each stage along with those factors that are key to success. Figure 2 and Table 5 are helpful to illustrate typical activities in each stage and the associated contextual factors. On the basis of such data, we surmise that in the early exploration stage of a programme, executive sponsorship is likely to have the most influence on progress (i.e. Case H rapidly progressed because a board director was an advocate of the programme). Following this, engagement will focus on demonstrating the opportunity of servitization and the piloting of innovative customer value propositions.Executives should find it particularly helpful to understand the characteristics of each stage along with those factors that are key to success.

        <p>Most helpful at this stage is the use of in-depth (and ideally independent) customer analysis using empathising techniques and structured experimentation with new service offerings at carefully chosen customer sites (i.e. Case A applied these techniques and rapidly progressed through this stage, while Case G developed an offering largely based on assumptions of customer need and still fails to gain traction). The subsequent Expansion stage will be characterised by increasing tensions between the support and growth of the new service offering(s) and the established (production-centric) business model, and this is likely to result in turbulence around people, their priorities and structures (i.e. Case A experienced such upheaval that the executive responsible for the initial focus on services was retired from the organisation but, after a short period of tension, he was eventually replaced by an equally strong advocate of services). In the relatively mature stage of Exploitation, the focus will be characterised by initiatives to improve delivery efficiency while continuing to innovate advanced services (i.e. Case B is entirely focused on these priorities).Most helpful at this stage is the use of in-depth (and ideally independent) customer analysis using empathising techniques and structured experimentation with new service offerings at carefully chosen customer sites (i.e. Case A applied these techniques and rapidly progressed through this stage, while Case G developed an offering largely based on assumptions of customer need and still fails to gain traction).

        <p>The characteristics and priorities of an organisation at the earlier stage of maturity are very different to the later, and these distinctions are very important to recognise when executing popular management techniques such as benchmarking. The practitioner should also be mindful that the time taken to progress through these four stages can be significant and may take decades for a company embarking on a servitization programme to achieve the capabilities typical of the later stages of maturity.The characteristics and priorities of an organisation at the earlier stage of maturity are very different to the later, and these distinctions are very important to recognise when executing popular management techniques such as benchmarking.

These are summarised in the below three areas:</p>
        <p>Development of a richer understanding of the process content at each stage. During this study it was observed that particular techniques and specific decisions were commonly adopted. For instance, Cases A, H and K used a business model canvas (see Osterwalder et al., 2005) as an analytical tool during the Engagement stage, while Cases B, F and M put in place a dedicated business unit to support services during Expansion. Therefore, within the model established here, it would be valuable to understand the variety, popularity and sequencing of process and content within each stage. Also, it would be valuable to know the relationship between these and the forces impacting the progressionperhaps in the first instance by dealing with each stage separately and in-depth.Development of a richer understanding of the process content at each stage.

        <p>Investigate the linkages between context and process. A richer understanding of process and context would then allow an investigation into whether there are distinct selections and sequences of activities through the pathways. A likelihood exists that various pathways exist and organisations may switch pathways as people and contextual circumstances change.Investigate the linkages between context and process.

        <p>Development of a prescriptive transformation roadmap. As mentioned, this descriptive study set out to lay the foundation for a more prescriptive process that practitioners can follow in order to servitize their businesses and compete through advanced services. Future research should explore links between different aspects of our progression model (e.g., the four macrostages, the five forces and their interplay) and servitization journey outcome measures, such as the rate of progression along the journey or the efficiency and effectiveness with which advanced services are provided. Rationalising this knowledge into a management aid is a logical next step, and yet caution will be required as the multitude of variables could easily result in a process that is overly complex and unworkable.
