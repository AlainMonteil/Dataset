        <p>Existing studies suggest that platform access restrictions may cause restricted complementors to switch to competing platforms, which will increase complement quantity on competing platforms. We re-examine this prediction by accounting for the impact of economies of scope on complementor responses to platform access restriction. We argue that restricting a complementor's access on a platform may prevent it from achieving economies of scope from multi-homing, thereby incentivizing it to abandon both the restricted and (unrestricted) competing platforms. Using rideshare data in New York City, we compare the numbers of trips made by Lyft and Uber drivers, respectively, before and after Lyft restricted drivers' access on its platform. We find that Lyft's access restriction reduced trip numbers not only on the Lyft platform but also on the Uber platform. In addition, both Lyft's and Uber's trip numbers decreased not only during the restricted low-demand periods (e.g., non-rush hours) but also during the unrestricted high-demand periods (e.g., rush hours). In contrast, after a substantial number of multi-homing drivers left both platforms following Lyft's access restriction, a subsequent access restriction by Uber led to an increase in trip numbers on the Lyft platform. These results highlight the importance of accounting for interdependencies across complementor activities when designing platform governance policies.Existing studies suggest that platform access restrictions may cause restricted complementors to switch to competing platforms, which will increase complement quantity on competing platforms.

        <p>Over the last decade, platforms have become a ubiquitous mode for organizing technological and economic exchanges in many industries, attracting attention from academic scholars, policymakers, and business practitioners alike (Adner et al. 2019, Gambardella and Von Hippel 2019, Kretschmer et al. 2022, Seamans and Zhu 2014). A key characteristic of platforms is their reliance on complementors to create value (Gawer and Cusumano 2002). 1 Unlike traditional hierarchical organizations, platforms lack the authority and direct control over complementors (Hagiu andWright 2019, Jacobides et al. 2018), which creates unique challenges for platforms to govern complementor activities. One important instrument of platform governance is access control (Boudreau 2010, Parker andVan Alstyne 2018). By relaxing or tightening access restrictions, platforms can moderate the quantity and quality of complementor activities within and across platforms.Over the last decade, platforms have become a ubiquitous mode for organizing technological and economic exchanges in many industries, attracting attention from academic scholars, policymakers, and business practitioners alike (Adner et al. 2019, Gambardella and Von Hippel 2019, Kretschmer et al. 2022, Seamans and Zhu 2014).

        <p>Existing studies suggest two effects of platform access restriction. On the one hand, it reduces competition among complementors and encourages them to improve the quality of their products or services (or complements) (Casadesus-Masanell and Hałaburda 2014). On the other hand, it reduces the quantity of complements on the restricted platform due to the exit of restricted complementors (Eisenmann et al. 2009). Some of these restricted complementors will switch to competing platforms, causing a loss of competitive advantage for the restricted platform. For example, a video game platform can use licensing policies to restrict the number of game developers. Nintendo used such policies during the late 1980s to restrict the number of developers that could publish game titles on its platform (Brandenburger 1995). While such restriction enabled Nintendo to retain a group of high-quality game developers, it also forced other developers to switch to Sega, a competing platform that did not enforce strict access restriction (Schilling 2003).Existing studies suggest two effects of platform access restriction.

        <p>However, the impact of access restriction on complement quantity may not be so straightforward once we account for cross-platform economies of scope. As complementors make large investments in complementor-specific resources, some of them need to operate on multiple platforms to spread their fixed investments across a larger scale. Such calculations may influence their decision to engage with different platforms. For example, since the early 2000s, video game platforms began to provide software development toolkits (SDKs) that lowered development costs for individual developers (Ozalp et al. 2018).However, the impact of access restriction on complement quantity may not be so straightforward once we account for cross-platform economies of scope.

        <p>This induced a large pool of new developers to enter the industry. 2 The intensified competition forced developers to differentiate with complementor-specific investments, such as investments in content, art design, and music composition (Reimer 2005). Recouping these large investments necessitated larger markets -"larger perhaps than any one platform can provide" (Corts and Lederman 2009, p. 125). 3 Consequently, game developers were incentivized to spread their development costs by operating on multiple platforms, or multi-homing (Cennamo et al. 2018, Hagiu 2009).This induced a large pool of new developers to enter the industry. 2 The intensified competition forced developers to differentiate with complementor-specific investments, such as investments in content, art design, and music composition (Reimer 2005).

        <p>Multi-homing is common not only in technological platforms such as video game consoles and smartphone operating systems but also in transaction platforms such as e-commerce and rideshare services. 4 A complementor needs to obtain resources (e.g., game content or vehicles) and develop capabilities (e.g., video game development skills or driving skills in the rideshare market) to operate on a platform (Baldwin andWoodard 2009, Kapoor andAgarwal 2017). Some of these resources and capabilities are platformindependent but complementor-specific (e.g., specialized programming skills or luxury cars). When a complementor cannot recoup the costs of acquiring complementor-specific resources or capabilities from a single platform due to insufficient platform-specific demand, it can multi-home to take advantage of market-wide rather than platform-wide network effects to amortize such costs (Corts and Lederman 2009), 2 For instance, hundreds of PC game developers signed up to develop video games for Microsoft Xbox 360 after 
            <rs type="creator">Microsoft</rs> released its SDKs, 
            <rs type="software">DirectX</rs> and 
            <rs type="software">XNA Game Studio</rs> (Srinvasan andVenkatraman 2018, Tran 2001). 3 Video game development costs skyrocketed from each technological generation to the next. The average development costs were below $1 million in the fourth generation (early 1990s) but jumped to $15-30 million in the seventh generation (late 2000s). As of 2020, a typical blockbuster video game requires $60-80 million to develop (Coughlan 2001, Veresockaya 2020). 4 52 percent of video games are published on multiple game console platforms (Rietveld and Eggers 2018). 64 percent of the smartphone app developers publish their apps on both

            <rs type="creator">Google</rs>'s 
            <rs type="software">Android</rs> platforms (Kapoor and Agarwal 2017). 45 percent of rideshare drivers in New York City drive for at least two platforms (Parrott and Reich 2018). thereby creating within-complementor interdependencies (or economies of scope) across platforms.
        </p>
        <p>Against this background, we re-examine complementors' responses to platform access restriction by accounting for interdependencies across their activities. We argue that when complementors share resources across activities between platforms, restricting access on a platform reduces the market size for complementors and deprives them of potential scope economies. Losing such scope economies may force them to withdraw from both restricted and unrestricted platforms, thereby creating a potential crossplatform spillover effect.Against this background, we re-examine complementors' responses to platform access restriction by accounting for interdependencies across their activities.

        <p>We empirically test our predictions using trip-level taxi and rideshare data in New York City (NYC), where the two dominant rideshare platforms, Uber and Lyft, compete to attract drivers and users. Our data includes about 0.6 billion trip records provided by rideshare services and Yellow Taxi for years 2018 and 2019, with information on pick-up/drop-off times and locations for every trip. About 45 percent of rideshare drivers in NYC work for at least two rideshare platforms (Parrott and Reich 2018). In 2019, following city regulations, Lyft and Uber restricted driver access to their platforms in different geographic zones and at different times, which allows us to exploit heterogeneity in platform accessibility.We empirically test our predictions using trip-level taxi and rideshare data in New York City (NYC), where the two dominant rideshare platforms, Uber and Lyft, compete to attract drivers and users.

        <p>Our results confirm the cross-platform spillover effect of restricting platform access. Lyft's access restriction reduced the number of trips not only on the Lyft platform but also on the Uber platform. These results are robust to additional analyses that account for unobservable time-variant factors using three counterfactuals: Lyft trips after Uber's access restriction in NYC, taxi trips in NYC, and rideshare trips in Chicago, respectively. We also find evidence in support of the mechanism: The exit of multi-homing drivers in NYC following Lyft's access restriction. Lastly, we find both Uber and Lyft experienced a decline in their trip numbers not only during restricted low-demand periods (e.g., non-rush hours) but also during unrestricted high-demand periods (e.g., rush hours). These results highlight the importance of accounting for interdependencies across complementor activities when designing platform access restriction policies.Our results confirm the cross-platform spillover effect of restricting platform access.

        <p>Orchestrating a large pool of complementors is crucial for the success of a platform (Gawer and Cusumano 2002). Unlike hierarchical organizations, platforms lack direct control over complementors and cannot use levers such as employment contracts or hierarchical authority to dictate complementor activities (Hagiu andWright 2019, Jacobides et al. 2018). Instead, platforms rely on a different set of levers such as standards, certifications, reputation systems, and information control (Li and Zhu 2021, Miller and Toh 2022, Rietveld et al. 2021). One prominent governance tool is platform access restriction, which regulates the level of access to the platform (Halaburda et al. 2018, O'Mahony and Karp 2022, Parker and Van Alstyne 2018). Access restriction can vary along multiple dimensions, such as access costs (e.g., licensing fees), pricing rules (e.g., subscription renewals), or regulation rules (e.g., restriction on interactions with users or other complementors) (Gawer and Cusumano 2014).Orchestrating a large pool of complementors is crucial for the success of a platform (Gawer and Cusumano 2002).

        <p>An existing strand of literature has examined how access restriction influences complementor activities within the restricted platform and revealed two countervailing effects. On the one hand, access restriction enables the platform to selectively retain high-quality complementors and reduces competition among remaining complementors, which encourages them to make platform-specific investments and improve complement quality (Casadesus-Masanell andHałaburda 2014, Chu andWu 2021). On the other hand, access restriction may reduce the quantity of complements on the restricted platform as restricted complementors leave (Boudreau 2010, Eisenmann et al. 2009).An existing strand of literature has examined how access restriction influences complementor activities within the restricted platform and revealed two countervailing effects.

        <p>In addition, a limited number of studies on cross-platform effects, mostly theoretical or based on case studies, suggest that some of those restricted complementors may switch to a competing platform, thereby creating a substitutive spillover effect across platforms and a loss of competitive advantage for the restricted platform (Eisenmann et al. 2009, Schilling 2003, West 2003). Anecdotally, Sony failed to maintain its initially dominant position after VCR producers who were disallowed on Sony's Betamax platform joined JVC's VHS platform (Cusumano et al. 1992). 
            <rs type="software">Symbian</rs>, once the most prevalent smartphone platform until 2010, lost its dominance after its access restriction led major handset manufacturers to join the Android platform (West and Wood 2013).
        </p>
        <p>Taken together, existing studies on the within-and cross-platform effects of access restriction suggest that, while access restriction enables a platform to improve complement quality, it could also reduce complement quantity on the restricted platform and increase complement quantity on competing platforms. This substitutive spillover effect across platforms in quantity is often derived from the assumption that activities performed by the same complementor are independent of each other. In reality, many complementors share resources between activities across different platforms (Corts and Lederman 2009), which may result in within-complementor interdependencies that influence complementors' participation on multiple platforms. Consequently, we examine how platform access restriction influences the behavior of complementors across platforms.Taken together, existing studies on the within-and cross-platform effects of access restriction suggest that, while access restriction enables a platform to improve complement quality, it could also reduce complement quantity on the restricted platform and increase complement quantity on competing platforms.

        <p>Complementors provide their products or services on a platform by leveraging both platform-specific resources and complementor-specific resources. Platform-specific resources refer to platform infrastructure that a platform provides to complementors such as distribution channels, development tool kits, and algorithms such as those matching drivers and users of rideshare services (Gawer and Cusumano 2014).Complementors provide their products or services on a platform by leveraging both platform-specific resources and complementor-specific resources.

        <p>Complementor-specific resources refer to a complementor's resources that can be combined with platformspecific resources to produce complements (Baldwin andWoodard 2009, Cennamo et al. 2018). Examples of complementor-specific resources include developers' programming skills in writing software for multiple operating systems or game consoles, reputation (e.g., game franchises), and rideshare drivers' driving skills and vehicles.Complementor-specific resources refer to a complementor's resources that can be combined with platformspecific resources to produce complements (Baldwin andWoodard 2009, Cennamo et al. 2018).

        <p>A complementor can leverage these two types of resources as 'stepping stones' to create economies of scope in its activities. For example, a complementor can share complementor-specific resources between activities across different platforms (Corts and Lederman 2009). 5 Complementor-specific resources enable a complementor to differentiate its complements from those offered by others, but acquiring these resources can be costly for a complementor (Burtch et al. 2018, Tae et al. 2020). Resources are often accumulated over time and require significant investments (Dierickx and Cool 1989). 6 For instance, in the video game industry, a large portion of development costs is related to content, art design, music composition, and licensing fees (Reimer 2005). In the rideshare industry, 80 percent of drivers in NYC purchased a vehicle to join rideshare platforms. A typical driver pays a one-time fixed cost of more than $20,000 for vehicle purchase or leasing, licensing, and registration (Parrott and Reich 2018). The driver also needs to continuously invest in driving skills as well as vehicle maintenance and upgrades to maintain a high rating on the platforms.A complementor can leverage these two types of resources as 'stepping stones' to create economies of scope in its activities.

        <p>When a complementor cannot recover the fixed costs from a single platform, multi-homing becomes an imperative (Corts andLederman 2009, Hagiu 2009). Platforms often have different characteristics that attract distinct groups of users (Cennamo andSantalo 2013, Rietveld andEggers 2018). For example, in the video game industry, Sony PlayStation focuses on sophisticated graphics and attracts users that favor action and sports games. In contrast, Nintendo Wii mostly targets casual gamers based on its simple interfaces. In the rideshare industry, users adopt different platforms based on their personal preferences, third-party promotion programs (e.g., credit cards, firms partnered with platforms), and references (e.g., from family and friends, from another app). To the extent that different platforms have non-overlapping user bases, there is the potential for complementors to amortize their costs through multi-homing and benefit from market-wide network effects (Corts and Lederman 2009). Such within-complementor interdependencies can create a spillover effect in the choice of activities across platforms.When a complementor cannot recover the fixed costs from a single platform, multi-homing becomes an imperative (Corts andLederman 2009, Hagiu 2009).

        <p>Access restriction on one platform may hinder a multi-homing complementor's ability to share resources and amortize development costs across multiple platforms, thereby reducing its profit on the platform. We discuss this in detail in Section 5.3. 6 Protecting complementor-specific resources also incur considerable costs. In the smartphone app market, app developers often adopt both formal (e.g., copyrights and trademarks) and informal (e.g., design complexity, rapid innovation) strategies to protect their resources (Miric et al. 2019). remaining (unrestricted) platforms. In turn, some multi-homing complementors will withdraw activities from both the restricted and unrestricted platforms, resulting in a complementary reduction in complementor activities across multiple platforms. If a significant number of complementors multi-home to achieve economies of scope, the reduction in complementor activities (from the exit of multi-homing complementors) might outweigh the increase in complementor activities (from the inflow of restricted single-homing complementors).7 Therefore, we expect that in the presence of within-complementor interdependencies, restricting complementor access on one platform reduces complementor activities on competing platforms.Access restriction on one platform may hinder a multi-homing complementor's ability to share resources and amortize development costs across multiple platforms, thereby reducing its profit on the platform.

        <p>The empirical context of our study is the rideshare market in New York City, the second-largest in the U.S. (Akhtar and Kiersz 2019). Rideshare services in NYC have grown significantly since the entry of Uber in 2011 and the entry of Lyft in 2014. As of 2019, rideshare services in NYC provided about 0.7 million daily trips, compared to 0.2 million daily trips provided by taxicabs. Uber provided the largest share (70%) of rideshare trips, followed by Lyft (22%), Via (5%), and Juno (3%). This is an appropriate setting for our study for several reasons. First, the success of rideshare platforms depends on aggregating a large pool of drivers. Rideshare platforms are known for their aggressive expansion strategy to recruit drivers to provide real-time matching between customers and drivers (Garud et al. 2022). Second, the rideshare market in NYC is characterized by strong withincomplementor interdependencies. According to Parrott and Reich (2018), about 45 percent of drivers work for at least two rideshare platforms (i.e., multi-home) to amortize the cost of acquiring or leasing vehicles.The empirical context of our study is the rideshare market in New York City, the second-largest in the U.S. (Akhtar and Kiersz 2019).

        <p>Third, NYC provides trip-level data for both rideshare and taxi businesses, which allows us to use taxi trips as a control group to account for unobserved location-or time-specific factors that might confound our results. Lastly, and most importantly, a regulatory change in NYC provides a quasi-natural experiment for our study. Starting in 2018, NYC imposed several regulations on rideshare companies to ease road congestion. In particular, on February 1 st , 2019, the city council passed Local Law 150 of 2018 that penalized rideshare platforms for running too many empty vehicles on the streets. This led Lyft and Uber to implement new access restriction policies. Starting June 27 th , 2019, Lyft blocked drivers from accessing its app in low-demand periods or locations (Lyft 2019). Drivers had to either drive to a busier location or wait until demand picked up. Uber followed suit on September 17 th , 2019 (Uber 2019). Because Lyft and Uber restricted access to their platforms during different time periods, we are able to exploit heterogeneity in platform access restriction across different platforms.Third, NYC provides trip-level data for both rideshare and taxi businesses, which allows us to use taxi trips as a control group to account for unobserved location-or time-specific factors that might confound our results.

This led Lyft and Uber to implement new access restriction policies. Starting June 27 th , 2019, Lyft blocked drivers from accessing its app in low-demand periods or locations (Lyft 2019). Drivers had to either drive to a busier location or wait until demand picked up. Uber followed suit on September 17 th , 2019 (Uber 2019). Because Lyft and Uber restricted access to their platforms during different time periods, we are able to exploit heterogeneity in platform access restriction across different platforms.</p>
        <p>The context has a few additional features that can help us tease apart multiple effects of platform access restriction across platforms: (1) the complementary spillover effect from the exit of multi-homing complementors dependent on scope economies, (2) the substitutive spillover effect from the shift of singlehoming complementors to unrestricted platforms, and (3) the entry-deterrent effect of new complementors.The context has a few additional features that can help us tease apart multiple effects of platform access restriction across platforms: (1) the complementary spillover effect from the exit of multi-homing complementors dependent on scope economies, (2) the substitutive spillover effect from the shift of singlehoming complementors to unrestricted platforms, and (3) the entry-deterrent effect of new complementors.</p>
        <p>First, access restriction policies in our empirical context were more binding on marginal complementors than on productive complementors due to the exceptions made for productive drivers. For instance, Lyft drivers who maintained an acceptance rate above 90 percent and completed 100 trips in 30 days were exempted from the restriction (Lyft 2019). Uber drivers needed to complete at least 425 trips in the prior month and have at least a 4.8-star rating to be exempted from the restriction (Uber 2019). This setting, together with the information on service quality before and after the access restriction, allows us to focus on (marginal) multi-homing complementors who need businesses from multiple platforms to breakeven.First, access restriction policies in our empirical context were more binding on marginal complementors than on productive complementors due to the exceptions made for productive drivers.

        <p>Second, Uber started restricting access three months after Lyft, when the majority of (marginal) multi-homing drivers would have already exited the industry. Because Uber's restriction threshold was stricter than that of Lyft, Uber drivers that did not satisfy Uber's access criteria would switch to Lyft after Uber's access restriction. Consequently, Uber's access restriction should have a larger substitutive spillover effect from the shift of single-homing complementors since a large quantity of the complementary spillover effect would have been eliminated with Lyft's access restriction.Second, Uber started restricting access three months after Lyft, when the majority of (marginal) multi-homing drivers would have already exited the industry.

        <p>Finally, the loss of scope economies following access restriction on one platform can discourage some (marginal) new complementors from entering both platforms. Empirically, following Local Law 147 of 2018, Uber and Lyft stopped accepting new drivers on April 1 st and April 19 th , 2019, respectively (Rubinstein 2019). This enables us to study the activities of incumbent complementors without worrying about complications due to new entry.Finally, the loss of scope economies following access restriction on one platform can discourage some (marginal) new complementors from entering both platforms.

        <p>We obtain anonymized trip-level data from NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), the agency responsible for licensing and regulating the city's taxis and rideshare vehicles. All taxi fleets and rideshare services are required to submit their trip records to TLC. The data includes about 1.3 billion trip records provided by rideshare services and Yellow Taxi from 2015 to 2019, with information on pick-up/drop-off times and locations for every trip. Information on locations is given as one of 263 taxi zones in NYC. 8 We estimate the change in trip numbers by Lyft and Uber drivers after Lyft restricted access to its app on June 27 th , 2019. We choose our sample period to be from four weeks before June 27 th , 2019 to four weeks after (May 30 th -July 24 th , 2019). Because demand and supply for transportation could differ between weekdays and weekends, we follow prior studies in the transportation sector (e.g., Forbes and Lederman 2010) to exclude weekends. We aggregate the trip-level data to the hour-day-zone level. Our final sample contains 252,480 observations across 960 day-hours and 263 zones.We obtain anonymized trip-level data from NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), the agency responsible for licensing and regulating the city's taxis and rideshare vehicles.

        <p>Our main specification controls for the trip number on the platform of interest in the prior year (to account for platform-specific seasonal fluctuations) and the number of taxi trips during the same sample period (to account for unobserved common shocks in a geographic area or time period that might influence trip numbers across all private transportation services). However, there still might be unobservable timevariant factors that our control variables do not fully capture. Our empirical goal is to estimate the effect of a focal platform's (e.g., Lyft's) access restriction on other platforms (e.g., Uber) that share multi-homing drivers with the focal platform. Therefore, an ideal counterfactual for our test would be an otherwise identical firm (a platform or a private transportation provider) that (1) did not share multi-homing drivers with the restricted platform, or (2) did not experience an access restriction, or both. Not surprisingly, such ideal counterfactuals do not exist in our setting. Instead, we use three counterfactuals that are close to the ideal counterfactual together with discussions of the unobservable time-variant factors that they each intend to address.Our main specification controls for the trip number on the platform of interest in the prior year (to account for platform-specific seasonal fluctuations) and the number of taxi trips during the same sample period (to account for unobserved common shocks in a geographic area or time period that might influence trip numbers across all private transportation services).

For example, rideshare drivers in NYC might expect the unfavorable regulations toward rideshare would continue or even worsen in the near future and decide to exit the industry. That is, the reduction in Uber trips might be caused not by the exit of multi-homing drivers hurt by Lyft's restriction but by a "chilling effect" experienced by all rideshare drivers.A platform (e.g., Lyft) that did not share multi-homing drivers with the platform that restricted its access (e.g., Uber) in NYC There could be unobservable time-variant factors specific to rideshare platforms in NYC that might cause our results.

        <p>To account for such factors, we leverage a subsequent access restriction by Uber, the rival rideshare platform. More specifically, we use as a counterfactual Lyft trips after Uber's access restriction on September 17 th , 2019, three months after Lyft's access restriction. We expect the "chilling effect" to stay or even strengthen after both Lyft and Uber restricted their access. That is, there would be no increase in Lyft trips after Uber's access restriction if the "chilling effect" dominated. In contrast, our theory would accommodate an increase in Lyft trips because most of the multi-homing drivers who depended on the cross-platform scope economies would have left the industry after Lyft's access restriction, and the remaining Uber drivers were likely to be single-homing. After Uber's restriction, Uber drivers that did not satisfy Uber's access criteria (e.g., those who had a rating lower than 4.8 stars or completed fewer than 425 trips per month required by the Uber platform) would switch to Lyft.To account for such factors, we leverage a subsequent access restriction by Uber, the rival rideshare platform.

For example, passengers may be less likely to use private transportation services during summer, our sample period (Bloomberg and Yassky 2014). While we have controlled for seasonal fluctuations in our main specification, we employ a difference-in-differences (DID) model to compare Uber and taxi trips before and after Lyft's access restriction using the following specification: One potential weakness of this approach is that there could be a potential violation of the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) (Rubin 1980), where the outcome in the control group is affected by the treatment.

        <p>Upon a closer examination of the raw trip numbers of taxicabs and Uber, we find that the taxi trip numbers decreased, rather than increased, after Lyft's access restriction (June 2019), potentially due to seasonal fluctuations in demand (see online Appendix Figure A2). To mitigate the bias from the potential violation of SUTVA, we run a subsample analysis using taxi trips from outer boroughs. Studies show that Uber and taxis are not fully substitutable in NYC (Fischer-Baum and Carl 2015), especially in boroughs outside Manhattan (i.e., The Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island), which have been traditionally underserved by taxis. Column 2 in Table 4 shows that, in outer boroughs, Uber trips decreased by 10.69 percent (p &lt; .001) compared to taxi trips after Lyft's access restriction, similar to the result from the full sample.Upon a closer examination of the raw trip numbers of taxicabs and Uber, we find that the taxi trip numbers decreased, rather than increased, after Lyft's access restriction (June 2019), potentially due to seasonal fluctuations in demand (see online Appendix Figure A2).

        <p>There could be unobservable time-variant factors specific to rideshare platforms nationwide that might also cause our results. For example, economic cycles and changes in user preference for rideshare services might influence multiple U.S. cities, including NYC. The rideshare business in Chicago shares several similar characteristics (e.g., active platforms, market share) with NYC. As the sixth-largest rideshare market in the U.S. (Akhtar and Kiersz 2019), rideshare services in Chicago provided about 0.3 million daily trips in 2019 (compared to 0.7 million in NYC). Similar to NYC, Uber enjoyed the largest market share (72%) in Chicago, followed by Lyft (27%) and Via (1%) (Bellon 2019a). A detailed comparison between the rideshare businesses in Chicago and NYC is shown in the online Appendix (Tables A1 andA2). 14 Starting from November 2018, the City of Chicago provides anonymized data on rideshare trips, with information on pick-up/drop-off times and locations for every trip. Information on locations is given as one of 77 Community Areas in Chicago. 15 One weakness of the Chicago dataset is that, unlike the NYC dataset, it does not provide rideshare trip numbers by each platform, which prevents us from separating Uber trips 14 Another advantage of using Chicago rideshare trips as a counterfactual is that SUTVA is not violated. Because network effects are often localized within each geographic market (Lee et al. 2006, Zhu et al. 2021), rideshare trips in Chicago are not affected by Uber trips in NYC. 15 The map of Community Areas can be viewed on Chicago Data Portal (https://data.cityofchicago.org/Facilities-Geographic-Boundaries/Boundaries-Community-Areas-current-/cauq-8yn6, last accessed on August 15 th , 2022). from Lyft and Via trips.

        <p>To further validate that our results are driven by the exit of multi-homing drivers, we compare the number of multi-homing drivers in NYC and Chicago. While the Chicago dataset provides the monthly number of multi-homing drivers, the NYC dataset does not. Therefore, we first check supplementary NYC statistics on the monthly number of total unique vehicles (reported for each platform) and unique drivers (reported across all platforms). Under the assumption that one driver operates one vehicle, we can roughly infer the number of multi-homing drivers by calculating the difference between the total number of unique vehicles reported on all platforms (which includes duplicate vehicle count) and the number of unique drivers (which excludes duplicate driver count). Figure 1 shows that, after Lyft's access restriction, the number of multi-homing drivers decreased significantly in NYC while it remained constant in Chicago. 16 Again, this comparison suggests that our results are not driven by macro trends in the rideshare business. In addition, we can coarsely infer that the decline in multi-homing drivers is driving our results for the cross-platform spillover effect in NYC.To further validate that our results are driven by the exit of multi-homing drivers, we compare the number of multi-homing drivers in NYC and Chicago.

Not being able to separate Uber and Lyft trips in Chicago (due to data limitations) could be problematic if there existed certain shocks that affected only Uber but no other rideshare platforms in Chicago. For example, news media reported that Uber's shared trips (i.e., UberPool) decreased significantly in Chicago after Uber increased the price for shared trips in 2019 (Bellon 2019a).17 Consistent with these reports, we discover that, during our sample period, shared trips (-22.31%) decreased significantly more than solo trips (1.06%) in Chicago, whereas there was no such difference between shared and solo trips in NYC. To account for this idiosyncratic change in Chicago, we exclude shared rideshare trips from both the Chicago and NYC datasets, which account for 19.3 percent of all trips in Chicago and 11.04 percent of all trips in NYC, respectively, during our sample period.

Uber stated on its website that: "[Drivers] trying to drive in an area where there isn't enough rider demand at that time will not be able to go online." (Uber 2019).

        <p>Our reading of the company announcements, news articles, and industry reports suggests that which time periods and areas would be subject to an access restriction was determined endogenously based on actual traffic data rather than exogenously ex-ante. Consequently, to identify restricted time periods, we draw heat maps using the hourly trip numbers of Uber and Lyft, respectively, in NYC during 2018 (Figure 2). The heat maps show that both Lyft and Uber provided high trip numbers during rush hours (7-10 am and 5-8 pm), suggesting that non-rush hours had a higher probability of being subject to access restriction.Our reading of the company announcements, news articles, and industry reports suggests that which time periods and areas would be subject to an access restriction was determined endogenously based on actual traffic data rather than exogenously ex-ante.

        <p>Therefore, we assume non-rush hours (rush hours) to be restricted (unrestricted) segments.

        <p>- -----------------------------------------Insert Figure 2 about here ------------------------------------------It is possible that the time periods with low trip numbers on our heat maps capture a relative shortage of driver supply rather than low demand (which would subject the periods to access restriction). To further validate our distinction of restricted vs. unrestricted segments, we compare our heat maps with heat maps based on surge pricing in prior studies (Cohen et al. 2016). Surge pricing is the pricing algorithm that increases the prices of rides during periods of excessive demand relative to driver supply. If the time periods with low trip numbers on our heat maps were high-demand periods with few drivers, those periods should be subject to surge pricing. A comparison between our heat maps and heat maps based on surge pricing (Cohen et al. 2016) shows that the time periods with low trip numbers on our heat maps (i.e., non-rush hours) did not experience surge pricing, but the time periods with high trip numbers on our heat maps (i.e., rush hours) did. This confirms that the time periods with low trip numbers (i.e., non-rush hours) on our heat maps capture low-demand periods that were prone to access restriction.- -----------------------------------------Insert Figure 2 about here ------------------------------------------It is possible that the time periods with low trip numbers on our heat maps capture a relative shortage of driver supply rather than low demand (which would subject the periods to access restriction).

        <p>Following our identification of the segments that are most likely to be subject to access restrictions (i.e., non-rush hours), Table 5 first investigates potential heterogeneity in the cross-platform spillover effect across restricted vs. unrestricted segments. Columns 1 and 2 indicate that following Lyft's access restriction, Uber trips declined not only during non-rush hours but also during rush hours, implying that drivers withdrew from both time periods. Specifically, Uber trips decreased by 2.73 percent (p &lt; .001) and 8.37 percent (p &lt; .001) during non-rush hours and rush hours, respectively.Following our identification of the segments that are most likely to be subject to access restrictions (i.e., non-rush hours), Table 5 first investigates potential heterogeneity in the cross-platform spillover effect across restricted vs. unrestricted segments.

As a robustness check, similar to Sections 5.2.2 and 5.2.3, we conduct DID estimations that compared Lyft trips to NYC taxi trips and Chicago rideshare trips, respectively (online Appendix Table A3).

These findings contradict expectations based on prior studies that restricting access in one segment would encourage complementors to switch to unrestricted segments within the same platform (Kretschmer and Claussen 2016).- -----------------------------------------Insert Table 5 about here ------------------------------------------Next, we investigate the changes in Lyft trip numbers across different time periods after Lyft's access restriction.

        <p>We believe the contrasting results of a complementary within-platform spillover effect of access restriction may be attributed to within-platform economies of scope. A complementor has to incur costs to acquire platform-specific resources and to comply with platform-specific rules. 18 When a complementor cannot recover these costs from a single segment, it needs to operate in multiple segments within the platform (e.g., time periods, generations, or geographic areas) to fully amortize these costs and realize economies of scope. For example, a video game developer needs to invest significant efforts to learn console-specific technologies, such as technological interfaces and SDKs (Ozalp et al. 2018). Game developers can amortize these costs by redesigning game titles from old to new generation consoles.We believe the contrasting results of a complementary within-platform spillover effect of access restriction may be attributed to within-platform economies of scope.

        <p>Similarly, in the rideshare market, Uber drivers need to maintain a minimum of 4.6 rating to avoid suspension from the platform and exploit real-time matching algorithms.

        <p>Losing access to one segment could hamper economies of scope and force a complementor to withdraw from both restricted and unrestricted segments. In our context, non-rush hour transactions provided a strong incentive for drivers to operate during rush hours. If Lyft drivers enjoyed scope economies from operating across rush and non-rush hours, restricting access during non-rush hours would have incentivized drivers to exit from both time periods.

        <p>Second, we estimate the effect of Lyft's access restriction on other rideshare platforms in NYC: Juno and Via (online Appendix Table A9). The results show that trips provided by Juno and Via both decreased after Lyft's access restriction, suggesting that the cross-platform spillover effect was not Uber-specific but rather universal across all rideshare platforms that shared drivers. Third, some geographic zones in NYC were residential areas and may not exhibit high demand during rush hours.

        <p>Finally, our categorization of rush vs. non-rush hours might not fully capture time periods that were subject to access restriction. To show that Lyft's access restriction had a spillover effect on Uber across most hours, we first calculate Uber's average trip numbers for each hour-day of the week pair (ATHD) for the four weeks before and after Lyft's access restriction. 19 We then plot the differences between the two sets of ATHDs as a heat map (online Appendix, Figure A4).

        <p>Our main analysis focuses on the effect of access restriction on complement quantity. As a supplementary analysis, we examine the impact of access restriction on complement quality. The literature has established that access restriction enables a platform to retain high-quality complementors (Casadesus-Masanell and Hałaburda 2014, Chu and Wu 2021). To the extent that interdependencies within multihoming complementors cause them to withdraw from both the restricted and competing platforms after an access restriction, we expect a quality improvement on all these platforms among remaining complementors due to the exit of marginal multi-homing complementors.Our main analysis focuses on the effect of access restriction on complement quantity.

        <p>We estimated the impact of Lyft's access restriction on Lyft's and Uber's trip duration (controlling for distance and the total trip number of rideshare services and taxis during the hour), the only (indirect) quality measure that can be obtained from our data. 20 Prior studies have used driver detours to measure Uber and taxi drivers' fraud and treated longer trip duration as lower service quality (Liu et al. 2021). Our results (online Appendix Table A13) show that the trip duration of Lyft and Uber decreased by 2.41 percent and 2.96 percent, respectively, after Lyft's access restriction (p &lt; .001). 21 This result, despite being inconclusive due to data limitations, confirms our expectation of a quality improvement due to the exit of marginal multi-homing drivers from both the restricted and competing platforms. 22 20 Detailed specifications are presented in the online Appendix. Supplementary statistics show that on average, trip durations were the longest for Lyft (19.1 minutes), followed by taxis (18.6 minutes) and Uber (18.3 minutes). For the average trip distance, taxi trips had the longest distance (3.3 miles), followed by Lyft (3.08 miles) and Uber (2.89 miles). 21 One caveat of our measure is that trip duration may be endogenous to the number of vehicles on the road. Even though we control for trip distance and the total trip number of rideshare services and taxis during the hour to partly account for road congestion, we do not have data on public transportation or privately owned vehicles to account for the impact of reduced congestion. To mitigate the bias from reduced road congestion, we employ a DID estimation using taxi trips as a counterfactual. Taxi trips were also subject to the reduced congestion after Lyft access restriction, which enables us to control for the time trend in road congestion. Our results hold. 22 The literature has also pointed to potential quality advantages of multi-homing complementors compared to singlehoming complementors. For example, they are likely to possess more resources, higher technological capability, and a larger user base (e.g., Cennamo et al. 2018), which enable them to offer better quality.

        <p>Using trip-level data of rideshare services in New York City, we investigated changes in Lyft's and Uber's trip numbers after Lyft restricted drivers' access to its app during low-demand periods. We find that Lyft's access restriction reduced trip numbers not only on the Lyft platform but also on the Uber platform. In addition, both Lyft's and Uber's trip numbers decreased not only during restricted low-demand periods (e.g., non-rush hours) but also during unrestricted high-demand periods (e.g., rush hours). Our findings support the argument that restricting platform access could weaken potential scope economies from resource sharing and motivate complementors to withdraw from both restricted and unrestricted platforms or segments. With these findings, we provide the first empirical evidence for within-complementor interdependencies.Using trip-level data of rideshare services in New York City, we investigated changes in Lyft's and Uber's trip numbers after Lyft restricted drivers' access to its app during low-demand periods.

        <p>Our study contributes to the platform literature in several ways. First, it extends the research on platform governance by connecting it with the research on within-firm interdependencies. Recent studies on platform governance show that a change in governance policies can significantly influence the activity scope of complementors (e.g., product portfolios) (Koo and Eesley 2021, Rietveld et al. 2021, Tae et al. 2020). However, these studies "do not consider multi-homing of complementors" (Tae et al. 2020, p. 324) and are "conducted within the boundary of one platform" (Koo and Eesley 2021, p. 961), thereby neglecting multi-homing complementors may downgrade complement quality on all platforms they withdraw from. Our results do not support this alternative prediction in our specific context. potential interdependencies that could arise from (multi-homing) complementor activities across platforms.Our study contributes to the platform literature in several ways.

        <p>Our study shows that these interdependencies may bring unintended consequences of platform access restriction. Studies on within-firm interdependencies suggest not only that an expansion of a firm's horizontal scope can be constrained by within-firm interdependencies (Zhou 2011) but also that a reduction in firm scope (e.g., divestiture) can potentially destroy synergy and hurt performance (Feldman 2014, Natividad andRawley 2016). By highlighting within-complementor interdependencies, this study suggests that multi-homing complementors may shape platform co-evolution by taking similar actions simultaneously on all the platforms they engage with.Our study shows that these interdependencies may bring unintended consequences of platform access restriction.

        <p>We also point out two sources of within-firm interdependencies based on different types of resources that complementors can utilize. Even though complementors leverage both platform-specific resources and complementor-specific resources to generate complements (Baldwin and Woodard 2009), prior studies have mainly focused on scope economies from sharing platform-specific resources (Giustiziero et al. 2021), neglecting scope economies that could arise from sharing complementor-specific resources across platforms.

        <p>Second, this paper speaks to the multi-homing literature. Several studies claim that multi-homing by complementors prevents a large platform from dominating the market and reduces its likelihood of "winnertake-all" (Eisenmann 2007). They suggest that a large platform should prohibit or penalize multi-homing through means such as exclusive contracting, vertical integration, or price discrimination (Armstrong andWright 2007, Li andZhu 2021). On the other hand, it has been discovered empirically that dominant platforms might lose a competitive advantage when enforcing such policies as multi-homing can provide access to high-quality complements that have been developed for new platforms (Lee 2013, Schilling 2003).Second, this paper speaks to the multi-homing literature.

        <p>Our paper reconciles these studies by suggesting that the prohibition or penalty against multi-homing can potentially discourage complementors from participating on all platforms due to the loss of economies of scope across platforms. Therefore, the net impact of prohibiting multi-homing will hinge in part on the presence of within-complementor interdependencies. When such interdependencies are high, platforms may need to allow multi-homing by complementors in order to achieve market-wide (in addition to platform-wide) network effects (Corts and Lederman 2009).Our paper reconciles these studies by suggesting that the prohibition or penalty against multi-homing can potentially discourage complementors from participating on all platforms due to the loss of economies of scope across platforms.

        <p>Third, the paper connects the research on platform competition with the research on competition between non-platform firms that share common third-party relationships, such as common suppliers. For example, in the soft drink industry, when a concentrate manufacturer vertically integrates a bottling firm to pursue its own product variety strategy, it changes the latter's synergy and incentivizes them to provide lower quantity and quality of products or services to rival concentrate manufacturers that use the same bottling firm (Zhou and Wan 2017). Such "discrimination" against downstream rivals can occur despite contractual commitments that suppliers have toward their downstream rivals. In this regard, platforms are unique in their inability to secure a commitment from complementors to provide the optimal quantity by either contracts or hierarchical control. We show that, in such a context, a change in governance by one platform (e.g., access restriction) can also influence complementor engagement with rival platforms by forcing multi-homing complementors to exit from both platforms. Our analysis, therefore, highlights an important common theme between the two strands of literature on platform competition and vertical relationship for non-platform firms, respectively.Third, the paper connects the research on platform competition with the research on competition between non-platform firms that share common third-party relationships, such as common suppliers.

        <p>Finally, the paper offers implications for platform firms and industry regulators. Prior literature argues that platform policies need to consider "interactions that do not happen at firm's boundaries" (Boudreau and Hagiu 2009, p. 187). Our study supports this suggestion and cautions platform firms against implementing governance policies without fully understanding complementors' interdependencies across platforms, as a small change in a complex system composed of numerous interdependent activities can cause unintended ripple effects (Ethiraj and Levinthal 2004). In addition, while antitrust authorities have started to focus attention on platform firms, both policymakers and academia have yet to conclude the best way to regulate platform firms. In October 2020, the U.S. House Judiciary Committee released a report that investigated competition in digital markets. The European Commission followed suit and proposed the Digital Markets Act in December 2020. Their focus was to prevent large platform firms from abusing their market power and ensuring fair competition. We argue that such antitrust regulations should not overlook potential interdependencies across platforms: Regulating dominant platforms might also damage smaller platforms by forcing (multi-homing) complementors to abandon both platforms.Finally, the paper offers implications for platform firms and industry regulators.

        <p>The study has a few limitations that offer opportunities for future research. First, our prediction assumes that a significant portion of complementors multi-home to amortize costs across platforms. Therefore, our results are not likely to hold in industries where most complementors single-home due to high multi-homing costs (Cennamo et al. 2018, Eisenmann 2007) or exclusive contracts required by platforms (Armstrong andWright 2007, Lee 2013).The study has a few limitations that offer opportunities for future research.

        <p>Second, the anonymity of our data and the lack of complementor identifiers prevent us from connecting trips to drivers or vehicles. As a result, we cannot identify individual drivers who drove on single vs. multiple platforms or during rush vs. non-rush hours. As explained in the results section, we have conducted various tests to pin down the mechanism against alternative explanations. Future studies can extend this research by examining contexts where within-complementor interdependencies may be directly observed.Second, the anonymity of our data and the lack of complementor identifiers prevent us from connecting trips to drivers or vehicles.

        <p>Lastly, while we focus on the short-term impact of platform access restriction, such policies might have long-term consequences. For instance, reduced competition between complementors can incentivize remaining complementors to make platform-specific investments, thereby increasing complement quality in the long run. Unfortunately, we are unable to empirically analyze the long-run impact of access restriction due to the outbreak of COVID-19 immediately after our sample period.

        <p>Based on Uber's trip number during the month right before the access restriction (13,949,257), we can infer that Lyft's access restriction reduced Uber's trip numbers by about 594,238. We estimate the average fare per trip to be $18.36. 11 As Uber typically takes a 20 percent cut from the fare, these numbers imply that Lyft's access restriction resulted in a loss of about $2.2 million in revenue per month.Based on Uber's trip number during the month right before the access restriction (13,949,257), we can infer that Lyft's access restriction reduced Uber's trip numbers by about 594,238.

        <p>Next, we investigate the average effect on Lyft trip numbers in Columns 3 and 4. The coefficient in Column 4 shows that, overall, trips provided by Lyft drivers decreased by 4.71 percent (p &lt; .001), similar to the percentage drop in Uber trips. That is, Lyft's access restriction reduced Lyft's trip numbers by about 224,635 trips and caused a loss in revenue by about $0.9 million per month. 12 While Uber had a much higher total trip volume than Lyft (likely due to lower demand on Lyft), the numbers of drivers on each platform (inferred by the number of unique vehicles registered) were not as asymmetric: Uber had 76,681 active drivers whereas Lyft had 52,185 active drivers as of June 2019. This suggests that (1) Uber drivers 10 To estimate the percentage changes in trip numbers, we exponentiate each coefficient, subtract one, and multiply by 100. 11 From our database, we first calculate the average trip distance (2.89 miles) and duration (18 minutes) of Uber trips during June 2019. In NYC, Uber charges $1.62 per mile and $0.74 per minute. We estimate the average trip fare to be about $18.36. For simplicity, we do not account for the minimum fare per trip ($8) or congestion fee charged to trips in Manhattan ($2.75), which cause our estimation to be slightly lower than the estimated average fare amount ($22-25.91) by news mediaNext, we investigate the average effect on Lyft trip numbers in Columns 3 and 4.

        <p>In addition to incumbent complementors, our theory also applies to new complementors. Access restriction on one platform will discourage some (marginal) new complementors who need businesses from multiple platforms from entering all platforms. Empirically, we only focus on incumbent complementors as our sample period was after a regulatory prohibition of new entry, as explained in Section 4.In addition to incumbent complementors, our theory also applies to new complementors.

        <p>Uber drivers cannot block shared trip requests (UberPool) though they can decline those requests. However, doing so would hurt drivers' acceptance rate. Accordingly, we can view the drop in shared trips as a decline in demand due to increased price (rather than a change on the supply side). In addition, Uber states that UberPool serves low-income neighborhoods that cannot afford solo rides. Therefore, users of UberPool are more likely to switch to public transportation rather than Uber solo rides when the price of UberPool increases.Uber drivers cannot block shared trip requests (UberPool) though they can decline those requests.
