        <p>Despite increased research into electronic word of mouth (eWOM) in the hospitality sector, the role of emotion in consumers' eWOM behavior remains underexplored. Highlighting media differences in eWOM, we apply online disinhibition effect and social sharing of emotion theory to investigate the consequences of consumption emotion for consumers' eWOM behavior and emotion-specific media preferences (social networking sites [SNSs] vs. review sites).</p>
        <p>Experimental results identify emotional intensity as the key driver of consumers' eWOM-giving intention on both media, whereas emotional valence shows media-specific effects on eWOMgiving. Satisfaction demonstrates a 'positivity bias' in consumers' eWOM-giving, but only on SNSs. Expressive suppression also regulates the impact of emotional intensity on eWOM-giving intention. We push the boundaries of valence-centered assertions in eWOM research and advance theoretical understanding of consumers' eWOM behavior through the lenses of emotion and media differences. Our findings have important implications for practitioners in the hospitality sector and for eWOM media providers.</p>
        <p>Electronic word of mouth (eWOM) has changed consumers' information consumption patterns completely in the digital age and is attracting increasing attention from both academics and practitioners. Originating from the concept 'word of mouth' (WOM), eWOM refers to any Internet-mediated informal communication about products, services or brands, regardless of the information valence (Hennig-Thurau, Gwinner, Walsh &amp; Gremler, 2004). In the hospitality sector, customers increasingly rely on eWOM to seek information about service providers and to share their personal experiences of service encounters (Golmohammadi, Mattila &amp; Gauri, 2020;Manes &amp; Tchetchik, 2018). For example, according to industry reports, 94% of travelers state that reviews are an important decision factor in choosing their accommodation, and 80% of customers will leave an online review if they are asked to do so (Condor Ferries, 2020;TripAdvisor, 2020). The existing research on eWOM appears to focus more on how eWOM information influences consumers' purchase decisions in the pre-purchase stage (eWOM-seeking behaviors) and significantly less on eWOM-giving (Chan &amp; Ngai, 2011;Kanje, Charles, Tumsifu, Mossberg &amp; Andersson, 2020). eWOM-giving refers to consumers' online sharing activities about a product/service/brand (Yen &amp; Tang, 2015). It is often drawn from personal consumption experience and occurs in the post-purchase phase (Liu, Jayawardhena, Osburg &amp; Babu, 2019).</p>
        <p>Although we know the general motives behind consumers' eWOM-giving behaviors (e.g., altruism, economic incentives and enjoyment), a fundamental questionwhy, of all the consumption experiences they have, consumers share eWOM about some but not othersneeds further exploration (Hu &amp; Kim, 2018).</p>
        <p>The literature on eWOM-giving behaviors highlights the importance of two elements: motivation and media. Although early eWOM research recognized that eWOM-giving is elicited by both cognitive and emotional antecedents (e.g., Hennig-Thurau et al., 2004), the role of emotion in eWOM has largely failed to undergo empirical scrutiny (Ahn &amp; Back, 2018;Borges-Tiago, Tiago &amp; Cosme, 2019). This is surprising, given that consumption emotion plays a central role in explaining consumer behaviors in the post-purchase phase and eWOM-giving plays an irreplaceable role in consumers' post-purchase behavioral response in the digital age (Yan, Zhou &amp; Wu, 2018). Similarly, although consumers' eWOM activities have penetrated various online media, their eWOM media preferences and cross-media eWOM engagement remain underexplored (Naumann, Bowden &amp; Gabbott, 2020;Xu &amp; Lee, 2020). The medium is an essential dimension of eWOM behaviors (Yen &amp; Tang, 2019;Zhou, Yan, Yan &amp; Shen, 2020). However, from the perspective of eWOM-giving, the dynamics of selecting different media for eWOM have not been fully understood. Nonetheless, the literature does recognize the potential impact of emotional state on individuals' media choices and selective disclosure of information (Choi, Thoeni &amp; Kroff, 2018;Wang, 2013). Such observations constitute an urgent call for understanding consumers' cross-media eWOM behaviors from an emotional angle.</p>
        <p>Against this background, we examine the impact of consumption emotion drawn from hospitality service encounters on consumers' eWOM-giving intention across different eWOM media (social networking sites [SNSs] vs. review sites). We focus on the hospitality sector as customers increasingly rely on eWOM when selecting a destination, hotel or restaurant and sharing their service encounters (Jia, 2020;Uchinaka, Yoganathan &amp; Osburg, 2019). Our inquiry is timely and important in advancing the theoretical ground of eWOM research and offering fresh managerial insights for practitioners in the hospitality sector. Specifically, we examine two primary dimensions of emotion in eWOM: emotional valence and emotional intensity. These dimensions are primary constructs that arise from an emotion-eliciting event and influence an individual's social sharing behaviors (López-López, Ruiz-de-Maya &amp; Warlop, 2014;Rimé, 2009).</p>
        <p>In the context of eWOM, we argue that eWOM-giving could be an outcome of the emotional intensity and emotional valence drawn from a consumption emotion. Given our objectives, we employ two scenario-based online experiments to examine the impact of consumption emotion on consumers' cross-media eWOM behavior. Our use of social sharing of emotion (SSE) theory offers a unique perspective in understanding consumption emotion concerning consumers' eWOM behavior and explains why consumers choose to share some experiences rather than others. Our approach of separating emotional intensity from emotional valence pushes the boundaries of valence-centered assertions in eWOM research and indicates the determining role of the emotional intensity of consumers' eWOM behavior. At the same time, by taking the innovative step of examining online disinhibition effect (ODE), i.e., people's media-specific self-disclosure tendency, in the context of eWOM, we advance our theoretical understanding of often-neglected media differences in eWOM and shed new light on the valence biases in consumers' eWOM media choices. From a managerial perspective, understanding emotion-elicited eWOM across different media can inform service providers of the utility of managing customer experiences and, most importantly, the conditions in which people give eWOM and which eWOM media they are likely to engage.</p>
        <p>In the next section, we present the theoretical background that underpins the relationships examined in this study and develop the research hypotheses. We then discuss the research methodology, followed by our analysis and results. We then present a discussion of the results and their implications for academics and practitioners. The paper concludes with the study's limitations and suggested future research directions.</p>
        <p>In adhering to the specific focus of consumption emotion in considering consumers' eWOM behavior across different media, we adopt SSE theory (Rimé, 2009) and ODE (Suler, 2004) as theoretical lenses. In what follows, the theoretical foundations and constructs under consideration in this study, and the rationale behind the linkages between the individual concepts, are outlined.</p>
        <p>Emotion in consumer research is often specified as consumption emotion, referring to the set of emotional responses elicited during product usage or a consumption experience (i.e., pleasure perceived in the consumption experience) (Hunt, 1977;Westbrook &amp; Oliver, 1991). Previous studies claim that consumption emotion has a strong impact on consumers' post-purchase evaluation and prospective behaviors, such as satisfaction, repurchase planning, word of mouth, complaint behaviors and switching behavior (Hume &amp; Sullivan Mort, 2010;Sumino &amp; Harada, 2004;Westbrook &amp; Oliver, 1991). Emotion is seen as playing an irreplaceable role in individuals' sharing behaviors. Lemerise and Arsenio (2000) suggest that this is driven by the emotion drawn from an event after it has been compared with the individual's existing knowledge. Following a consumption experience, a consumer might decide whether or not to share that experience through eWOM (Lemerise &amp; Arsenio, 2000;Zadeh, Zolbanin, Sharda &amp; Delen, 2019). This notion forms the basis for adopting Rimé's (2009) SSE theory to explain of consumers' eWOM-giving behavior that is driven by the emotions drawn from a consumption experience.</p>
        <p>The idea of social sharing originates from Festinger's (1954) theory of social comparison, which assumes that individuals constantly confirm their understanding and perceptions with other people, particularly when their emotions have led to confusion or ambiguity. Individuals share their emotions socially, seeking to be following others or to achieve superiority, thereby constructing their social reality (Rimé, 2009;Rimé, Philippot, Boca &amp; Mesquita, 1992). SSE is present in conversations in which people openly communicate their emotional circumstances, feelings and reactions (Rimé, Finkenauer, Luminet, Zech &amp; Philippot, 1998). The proposition of SSE is useful in exploring two primary dimensions of emotion: emotional valence and emotional intensity.</p>
        <p>Emotional valence refers to the "emotional evaluation ('positive' or 'negative') of particular events, objects, or situations", and emotional intensity to "the strength with which an emotion manifests itself, and it ranges from 'low' to 'high'" (Catino &amp; Patriotta, 2013, p. 441). Emotional valence and intensity are consistent with an individual's subjective evaluation of the valence and intensity of the original event, object or situation. For instance, a dramatic negative life experience usually leads to profoundly negative emotions (Rimé, 2009). We, therefore, posit that eWOMgiving behavior is a manifestation of how consumers share their thoughts and feelings following a product/service usage and is a form of SSE. Rimé et al. (1998) suggest that more intense emotion could lead to more frequent sharing of an event and the eliciting of emotion. Previous studies suggest WOM could be seen as a type of SSE and can be explained by SSE in the offline environment (López-López et al., 2014;Wetzer, Zeelenberg &amp; Pieters, 2007). Similarly, eWOM-giving is an act involving the disclosure of emotions and thoughts drawn from consumption experiences and could also be considered a form of SSE (Liu et al., 2019;Previte, Russell-Bennett, Mulcahy &amp; Hartel, 2019;Wakefield &amp; Wakefield, 2018). However, unlike sharing in the offline environment, where WOM is measured by frequency and volume, consumers are not usually expected to share eWOM repeatedly based on a given experience on eWOM media. This is because eWOM media creates pools of eWOM recipients with whom eWOM-givers want to share their emotions and experiences. Therefore, eWOM-giving is more likely to be a one-off behavior regarding a particular event and is usually measured by intention and/or an actual behavior on a particular medium. In such one-off sharing situations, emotional intensity drawn from a consumption experience is expected to be highly predictive of the likelihood of consumers' eWOM-giving behavior. We illustrate the differences between SSE in WOM and eWOM in Fig. 1.</p>
        <p>&lt;Insert Fig. 1</p>
        <p>The literature also suggests that individuals' SSE is not restricted by the social relationships between the sharer and the listeners and that emotional intensity motivates individuals to share their experiences and emotions with both intimates and strangers (López-López et al., 2014;Rimé, 2009). The diversity of eWOM media allows consumers to reach different target audiences in terms of numbers and the degree of intimacy required (Mohammadiani, Mohammadi &amp; Malik, 2017). However, since the impact of emotional intensity on social sharing does not differ with the recipients' intimacy level, the driving power of emotional intensity in eWOM-giving is present in both media. Thus, H1. Emotional intensity leads to higher eWOM intention on (a) SNSs and (b) review sites.</p>
        <p>SSE theory does not carry an inductive assertion of emotional valence in social sharing (Rimé et al., 1998). However, the eWOM literature suggests that emotional valence has an impact on consumers' media choice when giving eWOM (Coviello et al., 2014). The psychological mechanism behind the media preference can be reasoned as consumers' eWOM-giving on SNSs tending to be self-driven, whereas eWOM-giving on review sites is more likely to be fact-driven (Roma &amp; Aloini, 2019). In other words, consumers' eWOM-sharing on SNSs contributes to selfimage development, whereas consumers use review sites to reflect their experiences (Choi &amp; Kim, 2014;Kim &amp; Gupta, 2012). These initial incentives shape the content, including its valence, being shared on different sites. Thus, differently valenced consumption emotion could, in turn, influence consumers' behavioral patterns on SNSs and review sites. More importantly, Suler's (2004) view of ODE demonstrates that the sharing of dark emotions and ideas in the online environment is subject to the media used.</p>
        <p>The ODE refers to "the dark underworld of the Internet", in which people share very personal things about themselves/reveal secret emotions, fears or wishes (Suler, 2004, p. 321). These effects differ according to the media, depending on differences in dissociative anonymity, invisibility, asynchronicity, minimization of status and authority, solipsistic introjection and dissociative imagination (Suler, 2004). The cyberspheres of SNSs and review sites are very different, influencing, to varying degrees, consumers' choice of whether or not to share a specific consumption experience and emotion on a particular site. Table 1 summarizes the media differences between SNSs and review sites as outlets of eWOM-sharing through the lens of the ODE.</p>
        <p>&lt;Insert Table 1 here&gt; Following Suler (2004), and based on the above comparison, ODEs are present to very different degrees on SNSs and review sites. In terms of dissociative anonymity, invisibility, asynchronicity and minimization of status and authority, the audience on SNSs tends to comprise people with whom the consumer has interpersonal relationships, and interactivity is relatively high and synchronic. Consumers are unlikely to hide their identity completely, given the nature of social networking, and, due to the personal relationship between two parties and the information revealed by SNS profiles, people have more knowledge about each other when interacting on SNSs.</p>
        <p>Therefore, in terms of solipsistic introjection and dissociative imagination, consumers can imagine how significant others (e.g., friends and family members) would interpret their message and are unable to distinguish their online self from their real-world self to any significant degree. In contrast, revealing one's identity and interpersonal interactions on review sites is relatively rare, as the nature of the medium does not require/support such activities. Communication tends to be one way and asynchronic. The potential audiences for consumers' eWOM-giving on review sites are peer consumers with no personal relationships or knowledge about each other, which restricts solipsistic introjection and dissociative imagination. Therefore, the ODE is expected to be stronger on review sites than on SNSs. The main outcome of ODEs is that users are less inhibited about the dark side of their emotions and desires and are more likely to make negative comments.</p>
        <p>The existing research suggests that individuals' desire to share positive information and emotions on SNSs has been constructed as positive 'self-presentation' (Lee-Won, Shim, Joo &amp; Park, 2014) through positive 'self-disclosure' (Utz, 2015), thus establishing a positive 'self-image' (Gentile, Twenge, Freeman &amp; Campbell, 2012) and achieving 'self-enhancement' (Kim &amp; Lee, 2011) among significant others ('friends' or 'followers') (Chu &amp; Kim, 2011;Zhang, Liang &amp; Qi , 2020).</p>
        <p>In short, individuals' social sharing on SNSs is based on the premise that such content is being perceived as a positive characteristic by others and concentrates on the concept of 'self'. On the other hand, negative emotions inhibit consumers' sharing on SNSs due to the tendency to disclose oneself positively among other SNS members (Coviello et al., 2014).</p>
        <p>As already explained, in terms of sharing eWOM, users on review sites experience stronger ODEs than on SNSs (Suler, 2004). On review sites, what gathers people together is being a 'former', 'actual' or 'potential' customer of a particular product, service or brand (Hennig-Thurau et al., 2004). Since eWOM-giving on review sites is more likely to be reflecting on a consumption experience, consumers' eWOM-sharing relies on the 'facts' of the service encounter, rather than an emphasis on the 'self'. With fewer social constraints, consumers are under little or no pressure to avoid sharing negative emotions and/or content on review sites (Scott &amp; Orlikowski, 2014).</p>
        <p>Consumers' negative eWOM-sharing on review sites is often driven by appeals to restore justice, warn peer customers and take revenge on firms that have failed to provide a good service experience (Liu, Jayawardhena, Dibb &amp; Ranaweera, 2019). In contrast, consumers are also strongly engaged in giving positive eWOM to express positive feelings, share enjoyment, make recommendations to peer consumers and support companies, all based on positive emotions drawn from the consumption experience (Bronner &amp; De Hoog, 2011). Consequently, consumers' eWOM-giving on review sites tends to be factual and comparatively unbiased in valence.</p>
        <p>Based on the above, when considering the nature of SNSs and review sites, eWOM-sharing tends to be self-driven on SNSs (e.g., I enjoyed/hated my stay at Hotel A) and fact-driven on review sites (e.g., My stay at Hotel A was great/horrible). Such self-driven sharing is positively biased, since with weaker ODEs, SNSs function as pools of acquaintances, among which consumers tend to inhibit their negative disclosure (e.g., negative eWOM-giving) and consistently present themselves in a positive light (Kim, Park, Lee &amp; Park, 2018;Walther, 2007). Consumers' eWOM on review sites, however, is driven by facts (e.g., consumption experiences) and unbiased in valence. This is because these sites show stronger ODEs (e.g., high anonymity and asynchronicity), which minimize consumers' concerns about the content shared and allow them to reveal a dark side of their online persona in their online sharing (Gottschalk &amp; Mafael, 2017;Suler, 2004). Such media has, therefore, less inhibiting effects on consumers' sharing and results in unbiased eWOM-giving. Drawing upon the propositions of the ODE, we hypothesize, H2a. Positive emotion (vs. negative emotion) leads to higher eWOM intention on SNSs.</p>
        <p>H2b. eWOM intention on review sites is unaffected by emotional valence.</p>
        <p>Consumer satisfaction refers to a "summary psychological state resulting when the emotion surrounding disconfirmed expectations is coupled with the consumer's prior feeling about the consumption experience" (Oliver, 1981, p. 27). Therefore, consumption emotion is closely correlated with satisfaction (Mano &amp; Oliver, 1993). Based on SSE, we define consumption emotion as a concept composed of emotional valence and emotional intensity. The literature suggests that satisfaction is formed by interactive effects between emotional valence and emotional intensity (Dube-Rioux, 1990). Specifically, emotional valence (positive vs. negative) sets the tone for consumers' satisfaction judgment (satisfaction vs. dissatisfaction), and emotional intensity modifies the strength of the judgment (Cadotte, Woodruff &amp; Jenkins, 1987;Forgas, 1995;Woodruff, Cadotte &amp; Jenkins, 1983).</p>
        <p>Satisfaction and its effects on WOM/eWOM behavior have been subjected to frequent inquiry.</p>
        <p>The existing research recognizes the positivity bias in this context and there is a belief in a positive association between satisfaction and eWOM-giving (Jones, Aiken &amp; Boush, 2009;Söderlund, 1998). The proposition of positivity bias is rationalized as pleasantness predominating in the communication (Söderlund, 1998). Satisfaction reflects consumers' pleasantness drawn from a consumption experience and is, therefore, believed to have a positive influence on consumers' eWOM-giving in general. However, as noted earlier, consumers selectively utilize eWOM media to share eWOM information and, in turn, media preference shapes consumers' eWOM behavior on a specific site. On SNSs, consumers tend to inhibit negative disclosure of themselves and share more positive experiences (Coviello et al., 2014;Suler, 2004), whereas the ODE of review sites allows consumers to share positive and negative eWOM more equally (Suler, 2004). Although the positivity bias in the satisfaction-eWOM relationship is media-specific, consumption emotion is an important component of satisfaction, whereas the influence of consumption emotion on eWOM behavior could be generalized to the level of satisfaction (Hosany, Prayag, Van Der Veen, Huang &amp; Deesilatham, 2017;Prayag, Hosany, Muskat &amp; Del Chiappa, 2017). Therefore, with negative sharing being inhibited on SNSs and review sites being unbiased media, we postulate that, H3a. Satisfaction positively influences eWOM intention on SNSs.</p>
        <p>H3b. eWOM intention on review sites is unaffected by satisfaction.</p>
        <p>SSE theory highlights the driving power of emotion in individuals' sharing behavior (Rimé, 2009).</p>
        <p>However, during the process of transforming the emotion elicited from a specific experience into actual expressive behavior (e.g., eWOM-sharing), consumers may self-regulate their consumption emotions and adjust their sharing behavior. Emotion regulation refers to the shaping of which emotions people have, when they have them, and how they experience or express these emotions (Gross, 1998). Gross and Thompson (2017) claim that between a situation that triggers certain emotions and the response to the situation, a person must go through a procedure of attention raising and appraisal conducting. Therefore, as the emotional response is shaped in the process, the final behavioral outcome of emotion might differ from the original immediate physiological response to the situation based on the cognitive evaluation, the diagnosis of the social context and a prediction of the social consequences (Gross, 2014). More specifically, John and Gross (2004) argue that there are two attributes that might potentially influence individuals' emotion-elicited behavioral responses: cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. More precisely, cognitive reappraisal refers to changing the way one thinks about a potentially emotion-eliciting event, and expressive suppression implies changing the way one responds behaviorally to an emotion-eliciting event (Gross, 1998). Both regulating mechanisms function under both valences (i.e., positive and negative) and reduce the impact of emotions on individuals' responses to emotions.</p>
        <p>Prior research on emotion regulation asserts that individuals have different tendencies in employing cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression in regulating their emotions, which highlights the individual differences in emotion regulation. Such individual differences may not overturn the emotions that have arisen (e.g., changing positive emotions into negative), but could shape the impact of those emotions on individuals' behavioral responses (Gross, 1998). By following SSE theory, emotional intensity is seen as the key driver of consumers' eWOM-sharing.</p>
        <p>However, considering emotion regulation, consumers who are more likely to change the way they think or behave to regulate their emotions are less driven by the emotion drawn from the service encounters in their eWOM-sharing behavior. This is because they are capable of digesting their emotions before sharing them. We, therefore, expect cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression to weaken the impact of emotional intensity on consumers' eWOM behavior.</p>
        <p>However, research also notes that, in daily life, individuals who regulate the dynamics of positive and negative emotions in developing behavioral responses, especially social sharing behaviors, often consider the social context (Brans, Koval, Verduyn, Lim &amp; Kuppens, 2013). SNSs and review sites represent different online social contexts when considering the ODE. Compared to review sites, consumers' social sharing on SNSs is inhibited and self-oriented (Farias, 2017;Pasternak, Veloutsou &amp; Morgan-Thomas, 2017). Emotion researchers argue that mental effort is required in the process of emotion regulation to develop the behavioral responses elicited by the emotions, and self-conscious thoughts facilitate the emotion-regulating process and alleviate the impact of emotional intensity (Heppner, Spears, Vidrine &amp; Wetter, 2015;Pennebaker, 1985Pennebaker, , 1989)). Although review sites offer an anonymous online environment, which minimizes the effects of self on consumers' emotion regulation and sharing behaviors (Suler, 2004), it can be inferred that emotion regulation (i.e., cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) has a stronger impact on shaping the association between emotional intensity and eWOM behavior on SNSs, compared to review sites. Therefore, we hypothesize that, H4. Consumers' emotion regulation (a: suppression; b: reappraisal) inhibits the impact of emotional intensity on eWOM behavior (i.e., emotion regulation negatively moderates the relationship between emotional intensity and eWOM behavior), and that such inhibiting effects are stronger on SNSs compared to review sites.</p>
        <p>We devised scenario-based experiments in order to explore our research objectives. A scenariobased approach was deemed to be appropriate as it overcomes the issues of recall bias related to self-report techniques and provides an improved level of control in manipulations (Smith, Bolton &amp; Wagner, 1999).</p>
        <p>We chose a hotel service encounter as the background of an experimental scenario because this type of customer-facing service often triggers consumption emotions (Cantallops &amp; Salvi, 2014;Hosany, Martin &amp; Woodside, 2020). We developed four similar-length scenarios that differ in valence and intensity in order to elicit either a positive or negative emotion of different intensity.</p>
        <p>A series of vignettes described a service encounter at a 3-star hotel (i.e., a fictitious name, the Diamond Hotel, was given to avoid bias), covering three key aspects of hotel service: the building/room, furniture/equipment, and services. Participants were also given 3-star hotel criteria based on the standards of Expedia and the Hotelstars Union, which we used for reference and expectation-setting purposes in our study (Expedia, n.d.;Hotelstars.EU, 2015). We chose Orlando as the hotel location in the scenario since it is one of the most popular domestic holiday destinations (Gollan, 2015). Most participants would be familiar with Orlando and find it a desirable holiday destination, thereby better engaging with the scenarios. To enhance the realism of the scenarios, we recruited 52 participants from an online panel and asked them about their domestic holiday hotel booking habits regarding booking time (Mode = 6 weeks in advance, n = 18) and willingnessto-pay amount (Mode = $100, n = 24). The sample scenarios are presented in Appendix A.</p>
        <p>The experiment follows a 2 × 2 between-subjects design, with emotional valence (positive vs. negative) and emotional intensity (low vs. high). A pre-test was initially conducted for manipulation and realism checks. Following successful manipulation and realism checks, we used two separate studies that adopted the same experimental design to test the hypotheses. Fig. 2 demonstrates the purpose and sample size of each study. Fig. 3 illustrates the experimental procedure and rationale behind each step that was adopted in all the studies. &lt;Insert Fig. 2 here&gt; &lt;Insert Fig. 3</p>
        <p>A pre-test was conducted to perform realism and manipulation checks. We recruited an online panel of 102 participants from the USA excluded those from Florida to avoid any local residents of Orlando. To best serve the research purpose and recruit appropriate participants who could relate to the scenarios, we also set up a series of screening questions at the beginning of the experiments, including eWOM-giving experience on SNSs and review sites and recent hotel stay and holiday experiences. Participants with limited eWOM and hotel stay and holiday experiences were excluded. The participants who qualified for inclusion were asked to read the scenarios and to rate their feelings on the experimental realism (how realistic the scenario was) and mundane realism (how likely was it that the described situation could happen in real life) of the situations depicted (Liao, 2007;Roschk and Kaiser, 2013). The results (see Table 2) suggested that the situations in the scenarios were realistic. Emotional valence measures were adapted from Duprez, Christophe, Rimé, Congard and Antoine (2015). A single-item 10-point Likert scale supported the effectiveness of the manipulation checks: Mpositive = 8.40, Mnegative = 3.67, t(100) = 13.25, and p &lt; .001. One-sample t-tests supported the negative scenarios (test value = 5), t(85) = -6.318 and p &lt; .001 and positive scenarios (test value = 6), t(85) = 12.11 and p &lt; .001 being perceived by the participants as negative and positive, respectively. Emotional intensity is usually specific to a particular type of emotion. Therefore, in measuring emotional intensity in a positive case, participants were asked to rate the intensity with which they felt positive emotions, including enjoyment, pleasure, euphoria, fun, entertainment, enthusiasm, fascination and happiness (α = .94), in response to the described scenario on a 7-point Likert scale (where 1 = not at all and 7 = extremely). Similarly, negative emotional intensity was captured by the sum of anger, sadness, irritation, disappointment, frustration, indignation, disgust and resentment (α = .95). The &lt;Insert Table 2 here&gt;</p>
        <p>Following successful manipulation and realism checks, we recruited another 335 participants (from the same online panel, using the same selection criteria as in the pre-test) (aged 18-80 and 60.2% female). Each participant was randomly assigned to read one of the four scenarios and answer questions regarding the following dependent variables: satisfaction (α = .93; Patterson and Smith, 2003) and eWOM-giving intention (Leung, Bai &amp; Stahura, 2015) on SNSs (α = .96) and review sites (α = .95). All measurements can be found in Appendix B. In addition, notably, eWOM intentions on SNSs and review sites were randomly displayed on two pages of the questionnaire to avoid the carry-over effects of employing the same measurement for different media. During their participation, all respondents were required to answer a series of comprehension and attention-checking questions. The responses were only classified as valid if the respondents correctly answered all the questions.</p>
        <p>We employed ANOVA analysis to examine the influence of emotional intensity on eWOM intention. We observed that emotional intensity is positively related to eWOM intention on SNSs (H1a) (F (1,334) = 6.58; p &lt; .05) and review sites (H1b) (F (1,334) = 6.59; p &lt; .05). Both H1a and H1b are supported. Second, the impact of emotional valence on eWOM-giving intention on SNSs (H2a) is supported through the ANOVA analysis (F (1,334) = 5.39; p &lt; .05), suggesting positive emotion leads to higher eWOM-giving intention on SNSs. We performed the same analysis in examining eWOM intention on review sites. The results suggest eWOM-giving on review sites is unaffected by emotional valence (F (1,334) = 2.58; p &gt; .05), supporting H2b. Furthermore, we conducted linear regression analyses to identify the effects of satisfaction on eWOM intention on SNSs and review sites. The results suggest satisfaction positively influences eWOM intention on SNSs (F (1,334) = 10.43; p &lt; .005) but has no impact on review sites (F (1,334) = 2.96; p &gt; .05).</p>
        <p>H3a and H3b are supported.</p>
        <p>To examine the influence of emotion regulation in shaping the relationship between emotional intensity and consumers' eWOM-sharing, we adopted the same experimental design and data collection procedure used in Study 1 and measured cognitive reappraisal (α = .89) and expressive suppression (α = .92) from Gross and John (2003). We recruited another 351 participants (aged 18-80 and 51.3% female) from the same online panel, using the same selection criteria as in the pre-test and Study 1.</p>
        <p>As H4 involves examining the moderating effects of expressive suppression and cognitive reappraisal in the association between emotional intensity and eWOM-giving on SNSs and review sites, we employed the PROCESS macro model 1 with 5,000 bootstrap samples (Hayes, 2013).</p>
        <p>We controlled emotional valence and eWOM frequency on both types of media. As shown in Table 3, H4a is not supported, as the moderating effects of cognitive reappraisal are insignificant in the relationships between emotional intensity and eWOM-giving on SNSs (95% confidence interval</p>
        <p>[CI] = [-.093, .264], p &gt; .05) and review sites (CI = [-.045, .436], p &gt; .05). The same analysis was performed to examine the moderating effects of expressive suppression. As can be seen in Table 3, the results suggest that expressive suppression has stronger inhibiting effects (i.e., negative moderation) in translating emotional intensity into eWOM-sharing on SNSs (CI = [-.354, -.036], p &lt; .05), compared to eWOM on review sites (CI = [-.277, .014], p &gt; .05). H4b is, therefore, partially supported.</p>
        <p>&lt;Insert Table 3 here&gt;</p>
        <p>We had the aim of exploring how consumption emotion influences how consumers' eWOM-giving intention varies between SNSs and review sites. In so doing, we make three important contributions, in terms of the salience of emotion, the valence of consumption emotion and in identifying conditions in which consumers select their eWOM media. First, we illustrate the salience of emotional intensity, a hitherto unexplored construct in the field of eWOM, in explaining consumers' consumption-related evaluation and behavior in the post-purchase phase.</p>
        <p>Consumption emotion elicited during and after a service encounter persists in influencing consumers' eWOM-giving intention on both SNSs and review sites. Thus, we confirm the positive cause-effect association between consumption emotion and eWOM and give credence to the notion that there is a baseline of emotional intensity for sharing (Rimé, 2009). Consumers will only share eWOM for a 'bad' or 'good' consumption experience based on a particular 'negative' or 'positive' threshold of consumption emotion. This explains why a consumer may go through numerous consumption episodes in a given period but only choose to share one (or a few) episode(s) through eWOM rather than all of them. In other words, the level of emotional intensity that a consumption experience elicits indicates whether consumption is worthy of sharing.</p>
        <p>Following Rimé et al. (1992), we confirm that in a one-time sharing situation, emotional intensity appears to be more predictive of sharing behavior than in a frequency-measured sharing situation. Second, we examine the impact of consumption emotion on eWOM media preference through the novel theoretical lens of the ODE (Suler, 2004(Suler, , 2005)). The results identify that emotional valence influences consumers' eWOM behavior differently on SNSs and review sites. Extending previous research that recognizes the media difference in eWOM (e.g., Marchand, Hennig-Thurau &amp; Wiertz, 2017;Yen &amp; Tang, 2015), our findings suggest that consumers' eWOM-giving is positively biased on SNSs (i.e., positive emotions lead to higher eWOM-giving) and unbiased on review sites (i.e., eWOM-giving is unaffected by emotional valence). This is because review sites, with higher ODEs, allow consumers to share negative thoughts and emotions more freely, whereas consumers' sharing on SNSs is inhibited as these online environments are often connected with their offline world. From the perspective of motivation, our findings also indicate that, when compared, eWOM-giving is more self-driven on SNSs (i.e., eWOM-giving as an outcome of how consumers like to present themselves to others) and fact-driven on review sites (i.e., eWOM-giving as a reflection of what the consumption experience was like). Consumers focus on the 'self' when they share eWOM on SNSs, and sharing such experiences dovetails with building a positive selfimage with other members on SNSs who are 'significant' to them (Kim and Lee, 2011;Lee-Won et al., 2014;Utz, 2015). On review sites, however, consumers rarely know each other and eWOMgiving focuses on the product/service/brand instead of the consumers themselves, resulting in factdriven (objective) eWOM-giving (Bronner &amp; De Hoog, 2011;Hennig-Thurau et al., 2004). This explains why there is a positivity bias in eWOM-sharing on SNSs, but not on review sites. Based on our findings and previous empirical evidence, we can illustrate that eWOM-sharing on SNSs and review sites varies in terms of motivation, the nature of the sharing, the valence of the sharing, and the eWOM recipients (see Fig. 4).</p>
        <p>&lt;Insert Fig. 4 here&gt; Third, again, a positivity bias of satisfaction is reflected in the eWOM-giving intention on SNSs, but not on review sites. Aligned with previous research, emotional valence explains the tone of the satisfaction (vs. dissatisfaction); satisfaction is a function of the interaction between emotional valence and emotional intensity (Cadotte et al., 1987;Forgas, 1995). However, the effects of positivity bias vary across media. Plotting the relationship between satisfaction and eWOM-giving intention on SNSs shows a positive association in a check-like 'U' shape (see Fig. 5). In contrast, consumers' eWOM-giving on review sites adheres to the nature of consumption experience and emotion: the impact of satisfaction on eWOM-giving is insignificant, resulting in a more definite 'U' relationship. By observing the plot chart, on the satisfactory side (&gt; 4), eWOM intention on SNSs and review sites are not significantly different. However, on the unsatisfactory side (&lt; 4), eWOM-giving intention on SNSs is observably lower than that on review sites. The positivity bias on SNSs is cemented by 'avoiding the negative', which results in a stronger tendency between satisfaction and eWOM-giving intention. On review sites, satisfaction does not influence consumers' eWOM-giving because, as mentioned earlier, eWOM-giving is relatively fact-driven and bias-free on those media. &lt;Insert Fig. 5 here&gt; Finally, we illustrate the emotion-regulating mechanism in highlighting cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. Our findings suggest that expressive suppression alleviates the power of emotional intensity in driving consumers' eWOM behavior and that such alleviating effects are stronger on SNSs compared to review sites. In contrast, the impact of emotional intensity on consumers' eWOM behavior is unaffected by consumers' cognitive reappraisal. This implies that although consumers might change the way they think about an emotion-eliciting event (e.g., a service encounter), this type of reappraisal tendency does not influence consumers' eWOM behavior as a response to the emotions drawn from the event. John and Gross (2004) argue that although both cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression are practiced by individuals as regulation strategies to cope with emotions, the functioning mechanisms could be different.</p>
        <p>Cognitive reappraisal is antecedent-focused emotion regulation, whereas expressive suppression is response-focused emotion regulation. Here, it is reasonable to infer that eWOM-giving as an expressive behavioral response to the emotional intensity derived from a service encounter is influenced more by expressive suppression than by cognitive reappraisal. Since cognitive reappraisal is immediately triggered when the emotion-eliciting event happens, the emotional intensity developed from the service encounter may already have captured the effects of reappraisal. Our findings also reveal the media-specific nature of emotion regulation. Prior research (e.g., John &amp; Gross;2007;Troy, Shallcross &amp; Mauss, 2013) argues that individuals consider the contextual and situational factors when regulating their emotions and developing a behavioral response to those emotions. SNSs represent a more inhibited online environment, in which expressive suppression has a stronger impact on consumers' eWOM behavior driven by the emotions drawn from a service encounter.</p>
        <p>From a managerial perspective, we demonstrate the utility of service providers' paying attention to consumers' emotions, both when serving them and during follow-up customer interactions.</p>
        <p>There is merit in the argument that organizations should allocate resources to influencing the emotions that consumers come to associate with service encounters. Concerning positive emotion, the objective should not only be to elicit positive emotions, but also to exceed the 'sharing threshold' through appropriate incentives. In line with previous studies, we find that customer delight as a high-intensity emotional response derived from a consumption experience usually involves a 'pleasant surprise' and has a significant influence on consumers' post-purchase evaluation and intentions (Oliver, Rust &amp; Varki, 1997;Rust &amp; Oliver, 2000). Service providers should explore means by which they can delight their customers, to elevate positive emotions above the sharing threshold and maximize the chance of consumers' positive eWOM-giving (Taheri, Hosany &amp; Altinay, 2019). In the long run, concerns over consumers' emotional status and pleasant surprises could be absorbed into the organizational culture and brand identity, to develop sustainable customer relationships (Barnes, Collier, Howe &amp; Hoffman, 2016;Kao, Tsaur &amp; Wu, 2016;Nowak, Thach &amp; Olsen, 2006). For example, warm welcome cookies have become a worldwide signature service of DoubleTree by Hilton and have earned a good reputation among customers (Vivion, 2014). Emotion-oriented creative services not only increase the chance of consumers' positive eWOM on different media but also long-term brand building and maintenance of customer relationships. Service providers need to have a long-term plan for implementing creative and surprising services to trigger positive emotions. Sudden withdrawal or curtailment of such 'delights' might, however, lead customers to distrust the brand, although over time these might become the expected service, requiring yet further effort to delight customers (Rust &amp; Oliver, 2000).</p>
        <p>Conversely, where the likelihood of negative emotions has been observed, energies should be directed to diluting negative emotional intensity so that it falls below the 'sharing threshold'.</p>
        <p>Organizations could offer commensurate service, ranging from reaching out to customers to apologize to financial compensation. It is important to appreciate that such restorative steps should be implemented promptly to minimize the likelihood of negative eWOM being shared on both SNSs and review sites (Wu, Shen, Li &amp; Deng, 2017). After all, from a managerial perspective, negative WOM is likely to yield greater losses than the gains generated by positive WOM, in terms of both acquiring and retaining customers (East, Romaniuk, Chawdhary &amp; Uncles, 2017). More importantly, frontline employees need to be empowered and given the autonomy to make service decisions so that they can offer appropriate compensation if they detect negative emotions in customers during the consumption episode, to avoid unrecoverable losses such as negative eWOM.</p>
        <p>Therefore, in hospitality management, the management team should consider selecting frontline employees with both high emotional intelligence and the ability to think on their feet for end-ofservice occasions, such as presenting bills and checking out, to make a last-minute recovery effort (Hennig-Thurau, Groth, Paul &amp; Gremler, 2006;Wu, Tsai, Hsiung &amp; Chen, 2015). Such valueadding strategies do not have to be major and could be implemented through giving small physical incentives (e.g., free bottled water at check-out time) and providing special services based on customer needs (e.g., a packed breakfast for an early check-out). Furthermore, as this study suggests, eWOM on review sites is a better reflection of consumers' true feelings, which might, turn, lead to the higher perceived credibility of review sites when eWOM-givers are seekers of another product/service. Thus, the media owners of review sites should maintain the advantage brought by ODEs and encourage consumers to stay true to themselves and express their real opinion and feelings when giving eWOM. Media owners and consumers can then co-create a reliable and persuasive online environment. After all, customers' trust is the foundation of review sites' development and extension (Kim &amp; Park, 2013).</p>
        <p>As with any research, our study suffers from certain limitations. First, we only measured consumers' eWOM-giving intention through a scenario-based experiment, which opens the possibility for future research to replicate the findings using other methods (e.g., secondary data, memory recall and large-scale survey) and bridge the intention-behavior gap by taking a longitudinal approach (Mariani, Borghi &amp; Gretzel, 2019;Sloan &amp; Quan-Haase, 2017). Second, as media differences not only influence behavioral tendency but also linguistic expression (Bronner &amp; De Hoog, 2011), future research could examine the impact of media differences on eWOM expression and further explore 'self-driven' and 'fact-driven' eWOM across different media.</p>
        <p>Third, although review sites embody a comparatively high level of disinhibition effect, allowing consumers to give eWOM with fewer social constraints, extreme disinhibition effects might result in consumers going over to 'the dark side' of the Internet. In highly anonymous and invisible cyberspace, individuals cannot be identified through their online activities, which could lead to cyber-violence, cyber-bullying and other anti-social behaviors (Suler, 2004(Suler, , 2005)). eWOM on highly disinhibited media might lead to potential problems for organizations, such as intentional denigration from competitors and deliberate revenge-taking from customers (Liu et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>Future research could look into the dark side of eWOM and explore effective strategies in coping with the challenging behaviors elicited by eWOM communication. Fourth, as consumption emotion can change during social interaction (López-López et al., 2014), future inquiries could examine the impact of online interaction with friends on SNSs and with service providers on review sites on consumers' emotional intensity and overall evaluation in the post-eWOM phase.</p>
        <p>Finally, a single-service setting on only two types of media (i.e., SNSs vs. review sites) has implications for generalizability, particularly as any consumption emotion could be highly contextspecific (Baker &amp; Kennedy, 1994). Future studies could explore the nuances in different service settings within the hospitality sector (restaurants, leisure centers and theme parks, for example) over a wider range of media outlets (e.g., travelers' communities) to enhance the generalizability of our findings (Babić Rosario, Sotgiu, De Valck &amp; Bijmolt, 2016).</p>
