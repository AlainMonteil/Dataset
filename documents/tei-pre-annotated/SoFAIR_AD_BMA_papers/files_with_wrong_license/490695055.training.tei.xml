        <p>A circular economy (CE) is increasingly recognized as a more environmentally sustainable alternative to the dominant linear take-make-dispose economic model. We empirically investigate the effect of circular supply chain management (CSCM) on cost and financial performance in China, which has established the world's largest system of eco-industrial parks (EIPs) to promote CE over the last decade.A circular economy (CE) is increasingly recognized as a more environmentally sustainable alternative to the dominant linear take-make-dispose economic model.

        <p>We combine the Natural Resource-Based View (NRBV), Contingent NRBV and the literature on CSCM to develop a conceptual model and test it using survey data collected from 255 Chinese manufacturing firms. The results show that CSCM, when exercised as a unified strategy, has a significant positive effect on cost and financial performance. Firms located within EIPs adopt CSCM at higher levels as compared to firms located outside EIPs. Nevertheless, the contextual factor of being located within an EIP does not moderate the CSCM practice-performance relationship, suggesting that performance is driven by practices rather than firms' locations. These results were affirmed by postsurvey participant validation in three focus group meetings and six face-to-face interviews. Our findings contribute to sustainability literature by offering a new construct and measurement items relevant to CSCM and provide practical insights to guide a transition to a CE.We combine the Natural Resource-Based View (NRBV), Contingent NRBV and the literature on CSCM to develop a conceptual model and test it using survey data collected from 255 Chinese manufacturing firms.

        <p>In the long term, the current rate of natural resource consumption around the world will pose challenges for environmental and economic sustainability. According to the UNEP's International Resource Panel (2019) report, in the last 50 years, extraction of natural resources has gone up by over three times, creating an annual resource demand exceeding what the earth can regenerate. The circular economy (CE) can significantly reduce the consumption rate of virgin natural resources (Mathews et al., 2018). CE differs from the traditional "take, make, dispose" economic model as it aims to develop a restorative and regenerative industrial system by design, thus decoupling economic development from resource extraction and environmental impacts (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2019;Gartner, 2019). Given its promising vision, countries including China, United States, United Kingdom, and many European Union (EU) nations, have embraced the CE philosophy.In the long term, the current rate of natural resource consumption around the world will pose challenges for environmental and economic sustainability.

        <p>In the last few years, CE has received more attention in the supply chain sustainability literature and practice (Agrawal et al., 2019;Bai et al., 2020;Genovese et al., 2017;Govindan et al., 2020;Nasir et al., 2017;Van Wassenhove, 2019). According to Gartner (2019), leading global companies, such as Coca Cola, Apple, Dell, HP, Cisco Systems, and AkzoNobel, are investing in innovations to increase circularity in their supply chains. For example, Coca Cola invested €13 million to establish plastics recycling plants in the UK and France, outside of its core business model (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2021a).In the last few years, CE has received more attention in the supply chain sustainability literature and practice (Agrawal et al., 2019;Bai et al., 2020;Genovese et al., 2017;Govindan et al., 2020;Nasir et al., 2017;Van Wassenhove, 2019).

        <p>Traditional supply chain sustainability concepts, such as sustainable SCM, green SCM, and closed loop SCM, have been extensively studied in the literature. Circular supply chain management (CSCM), which Farooque et al. (2019b) define as "the integration of circular thinking into the management of the supply chain and its surrounding industrial and natural ecosystems" (p. 884), is still at its nascent stage of development. A key difference relative to traditional supply chain sustainability concepts, is that CSCM applies a zero-waste vision (Veleva et al., 2017) and enables value recovery not only within the original supply chains but across different supply chains through collaboration with firms in the same industrial sector and/or other sectors (Genovese et al., 2017;Weetman, 2017). Further, although research shows a positive relationship between supply chain sustainability and firm performance (Govindan et al., 2020), the relationship of CSCM with firm performance, remains largely unexplored in the academic literature (Agrawal et al., 2019). However, the financial benefits of CSCM have been reported in practice (Zhang et al., 2021). For example, HP's CE initiative in Brazil suggests that CE implementation resulted in up to 30% cost reduction, while 97% of the collected materials and components were reincorporated into their supply chain (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2021b). CE is not only implemented at the firm-level but can be used by a collection of firms in industrial parks or at a macro-level by cities, provinces, and regions (Ghisellini et al., 2016;Zhijun and Nailing, 2007).Traditional supply chain sustainability concepts, such as sustainable SCM, green SCM, and closed loop SCM, have been extensively studied in the literature.

        <p>As part of its CE strategy, China transformed some industrial parks into eco-industrial parks (EIPs) to close loops in resource flows and reduce waste over a system of firms (Mathews et al., 2018). However, there is a lack of knowledge on the role of EIPs and their CE practices from supply chain perspective (Bansal and Mcknight, 2009). Moreover, in China, some, but not all, of the traditional industrial parks and export processing parks have been transformed into EIPs. Therefore, many manufacturing firms in China still operate outside EIPs. Thus, firms' location (i.e., inside or outside of EIPs) may be considered as a proxy for CSCM adoption with significant implications for firm performance.As part of its CE strategy, China transformed some industrial parks into eco-industrial parks (EIPs) to close loops in resource flows and reduce waste over a system of firms (Mathews et al., 2018).

        <p>Given these knowledge gaps, this research is set to address the following key question: "What is the impact of CSCM on firm performance and how does being located in an eco-industrial park (EIP) affect the CSCM to performance relationship?" We empirically examine how CSCM adoption affects firm performance in Chinese manufacturing industries using a large-scale survey study at a supply chain level, followed by post-survey participant validation for data triangulation. This study makes several original contributions. First, drawing upon the firm's Natural Resource-Based View (NRBV) (Hart, 1995;Hart and Dowell, 2011), and a review of the existing literature, this study theorizes and develops a new construct, CSCM, to measure the extent of CE implementation at a firm and supply chain level. We incorporate material circularity in CSCM which is significantly different from the earlier studies of Cheng et al. (2021) and Zhu et al. (2010;2011), which did not include material circularity in the measurement items related to CE practices. Second, taking a contingent NRBV perspective, this study examines whether being located in an EIP moderates the CSCM-to-firm performance relationship. Overall, China provides a suitable context for examining CSCM-to-firm performance relationship, considering the Chinese government's stance on promoting CE as a mainstream national policy for about two decades. These contributions differentiate the research from previous studies in the supply chain sustainability domain.Given these knowledge gaps, this research is set to address the following key question: "What is the impact of CSCM on firm performance and how does being located in an eco-industrial park (EIP) affect the CSCM to performance relationship?"

        <p>The integration of CE in SCM is not new. According to a recent literature review on CSCM by Farooque et al. (2019b), the term "circular supply chain" first appeared in 2006. Since then, a number of studies (for example, Genovese et al., 2017;Nasir et al., 2017) linked CE with SCM. However, it was not until Farooque et al. (2019b) that a formal definition of CSCM was established as "the integration of circular thinking into the management of the supply chain and its surrounding industrial and natural ecosystems. It systematically restores technical materials and regenerates biological materials toward a zero-waste vision through system-wide innovation in business models and supply chain functions from product/service design to end-of-life and waste management, involving all stakeholders in a product/service lifecycle including parts/product manufacturers, service providers, consumers, and users" (p. 884). More recently, a comparative review of academic research and practical implementation cases by Zhang et al. (2021) shows that CSCM encompasses multiple dimensions, including closed-loop SCM, reverse SCM, remanufacturing SCM, recycling SCM, and industrial symbiosis.The integration of CE in SCM is not new.

        <p>The emerging CSCM concept makes three major advancements in the supply chain sustainability domain. Firstly, CSCM involves restorative (for technical materials) and regenerative (for biological materials) cycles designed based on CE philosophy. It represents a paradigm shift in supply chain sustainability research from a linear "cradle-to-grave" to a circular "cradle-to-cradle" approach (Genovese et al., 2017). Secondly, the zero-waste vision of CSCM goes beyond the boundary of sustainable SCM (Paulraj et al., 2017) and green SCM (Li et al., 2019;Liu et al., 2020;Schmidt et al., 2017) by encouraging the use of non-virgin materials through a systematic resource circulation within supply chains (Genovese et al., 2017;Koh et al., 2017). Thirdly, CE offers a broader sustainability perspective as compared to closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs) (Van Wassenhove, 2019). CSCM does not restrict the scope of value recovery from end-of-life (EoL) products to within the producer's supply chain. In a circular supply chain, firms collaborate with other firms within and/or outside the original industry sectors (Weetman, 2017) including secondary supply chain networks and/or involving new auxiliary players for recovering value from EoL products and/or wastes. Some recent studies based on the traditional supply chain sustainability concepts have recognized the importance of transitioning towards a CE (see, for example, Genovese et al. (2017); Li et al. (2021);Van Wassenhove (2019). However, none of these studies present a unifying CSCM strategy. Similarly, some early works by Zhu et al. (2010;2011) attempted to conceptualize CE practices at the firm level however, they did not account for circularity in the measurement items related to CE practices. Their CE practices construct was a repositioning of measurement items of green SCM (see, for example, Zhu and Sarkis (2004) for measurement items related to green supply chain practices. Likewise, the CE practices construct adapted in recent studies has been measured using the same measurement items (see, for example, Cheng et al. (2021). Thus, new metrics that reflect the circularity in the relevant practices are needed.The emerging CSCM concept makes three major advancements in the supply chain sustainability domain.

        <p>We conceptualize four CSCM practices, namely circular product design, circular procurement, cleaner production, and EoL product and waste management. Table 1 compares the CSCM practices with the related constructs from the literature.We conceptualize four CSCM practices, namely circular product design, circular procurement, cleaner production, and EoL product and waste management.

        <p>In the transition to a CE, the design function needs a fundamental change as it greatly influences the entire value chain of the product system. Research identifies the importance of design function in order to minimize products' environmental impacts over their useful life and afterwards (Brezet, 1997;Cai et al., 2022;Zhu et al., 2007b). Circular product design introduces design principles based on circularity and end-of-life thinking (i.e., a cradle-to-cradle approach), which are distinct from previous design concepts reflected in supply chain sustainability research (Burke et al., 2021;Farooque et al., 2019b).In the transition to a CE, the design function needs a fundamental change as it greatly influences the entire value chain of the product system.

        <p>The cradle-to-cradle approach emphasizes product design to continuously improve and ultimately achieve the indefinite circulation of resources. Moreover, circular product design strategies mainly focus on slowing and closing resources loops (Bocken et al., 2016) by designing long-life products and extending product-life thereby maintaining product integrity (i.e., preventing and reversing product/component obsolescence (den Hollander et al., 2017). Closing resources loops may be achieved by designing products for technical and biological cycles with simplified disassembly and reassembly.The cradle-to-cradle approach emphasizes product design to continuously improve and ultimately achieve the indefinite circulation of resources.

        <p>Green purchasing (Min and Galle, 2001) and environmental purchasing (Carter and Carter, 1998) practices are seen as environmentally-conscious ways of sourcing raw materials but do not integrate CE philosophy in the purchasing function. The principles of CE assume that raw materials used must not have any harmful effects on the environment (Genovese et al., 2017). Therefore, circular procurement strives for the use of natural, non-virgin, renewable, biodegradable/restorable and non-hazardous materials, contributing to closing energy and material loops within supply chains (European Commission, 2020). From a practical viewpoint, circular procurement may create vertical and horizontal collaborations focused on developing circular resource flows, adding new procurement channels and reducing costs through sharing or reuse of resources. For example, companies operating inside Kalundborg Symbiosis, an eco-industrial park in Demark, share and reuse energy, water, and materials saving money and minimizing waste (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2021c).Green purchasing (Min and Galle, 2001) and environmental purchasing (Carter and Carter, 1998) practices are seen as environmentally-conscious ways of sourcing raw materials but do not integrate CE philosophy in the purchasing function.

        <p>Manufacturing/production-related practices significantly influence environmental impacts (van Berkel et al., 1997) but they are rarely included in empirical supply chain sustainability studies. Cleaner production, which is considered as one of the key firm-level CE practices (Bilitewski, 2012;Ghisellini et al., 2016;Sousa-Zomer et al., 2018), has largely been studied as a standalone practice, for example, see Hicks and Dietmar (2007) and Zeng et al. (2010). Consequently, there is a lack of knowledge on the role of manufacturing/production practices as part of an integrated strategy for sustainability in supply chains (Farooque et al., 2019b;Sousa-Zomer et al., 2018). Thus, there is a need for a systems approach, examining cleaner production as part of CSCM. For example, cleaner production practices contribute to pollution prevention and waste reduction (Su et al., 2013); however, there is a need to continuously improve the related processes to achieve the zero waste goal of CSCM. Similarly, investment in new equipment may be needed for cleaner production practices to improve material/energy conservation and efficiency.Manufacturing/production-related practices significantly influence environmental impacts (van Berkel et al., 1997) but they are rarely included in empirical supply chain sustainability studies.

        <p>To establish circularity in supply chains, EoL products and waste management activities play a critical role in recirculating and recovering residual value within the product system. This involves a systematic approach towards managing circular resource flows through effective reuse, refurbishing, remanufacturing and recycling strategies for technical materials and compositing, waste-to-energy production and anaerobic digestion for biological materials by means of a supporting collection and treatment system (Farooque et al., 2019b). Unlike the reverse logistics systems and network (as emphasized in the traditional supply chain sustainability concepts), resource recirculation and value recovery in circular supply chains extends beyond the original supply chains (Farooque et al., 2019b).To establish circularity in supply chains, EoL products and waste management activities play a critical role in recirculating and recovering residual value within the product system.

        <p>Rather, firms engage in collaborative arrangements within and outside their industrial sectors to maximize the utilization of used and/or EoL products and materials instead of sending them to landfills (Farooque et al., 2019b;Van Wassenhove, 2019). Therefore, the EoL product and waste management activities present a broader scope which is not restricted to managing reverse flows in the original supply chains rather it considers the entire product system for resource recirculation and value recovery purposes.

Hart (1995) proposed NRBV by extending RBV to include a relationship between a firm and its natural environment.

        <p>The NRBV argues for developing a dynamic capability of proactive environmental strategies including: pollution prevention, product stewardship and sustainable development for sustained competitive advantage (Hart, 1995). Pollution prevention focuses on eliminating emissions, effluents and waste, which can reduce costs and lead to a competitive advantage. Product stewardship enables firms to minimize the life cycle burden of products by engaging stakeholders to incorporate environmental concerns into product design and development. Finally, sustainable development involves closely engaging with external stakeholders to build a shared vision for minimizing a firm's environmental impact, increasing competitiveness in the long term (Hart, 1995).The NRBV argues for developing a dynamic capability of proactive environmental strategies including: pollution prevention, product stewardship and sustainable development for sustained competitive advantage (Hart, 1995).

        <p>The CSCM construct presented in this research relates to the NRBV's pollution prevention and product stewardship strategies. Cleaner production, which represents the environmental efforts of a firm's internal operations, is aimed at preventing pollution at its source in the production process on a continuous improvement basis (Buysse and Verbeke, 2003;Cucciella et al., 2012;Paulraj et al., 2017;Thoumy and Vachon, 2012;Vachon and Klassen, 2006b). Circular product design and circular procurement are proactive stances to minimize a product's environmental impact and are aimed at realizing product stewardship through strong stakeholder engagement (Cucciella et al., 2012;Hart and Dowell, 2011). Moreover, EoL and waste management represent "take-back" strategies for resource recirculation and recovery as part of the broad product stewardship strategy (Hart, 1995).The CSCM construct presented in this research relates to the NRBV's pollution prevention and product stewardship strategies.

        <p>Firms operating inside EIPs get involved in buyer-supplier relationships of a highly symbiotic and complex nature, whereby they exchange physical materials, energy and services among themselves (Chertow, 2000). Firms within EIPs can use by-products and waste from others as inputs, thus saving on raw material purchase and waste disposal costs (Mathews et al., 2018). In this regard, EIPs allow firms to obtain resources more easily and better than competitors (i.e., firms outside EIPs). However, at the same time, this presents unique challenges and uncertainties for firms when comparing firms' operations in an EIP (i.e. industrial symbiosis) with typical supply chain network operations. It is mainly due to the fact that the products exchanged in industrial symbiosis networks are outside the core business of typical manufacturing firms (Herczeg et al., 2018). Moreover, the exchanges are not usually available upon demand, and the quantity and quality vary based on other factors such as production volume and production technologies being used by other firms in the industrial symbiosis network.Firms operating inside EIPs get involved in buyer-supplier relationships of a highly symbiotic and complex nature, whereby they exchange physical materials, energy and services among themselves (Chertow, 2000).

        <p>According to the seminal work of Zhu and Sarkis (2004) on green supply chain management, economic performance outcomes include both negative and positive aspects. CE often requires major initial investments such as increased training cost, new equipment or process modifications (Geng et al., 2009) which can increase costs in the short term (Li et al., 2019). Factors such as lower energy costs, savings from using recycled/reused materials, and reduced fees for waste discharge and treatment can reduce costs over the long-run (Mathews and Tan, 2016). Further, some customers may even seek out companies using CE practices potentially increasing their sales. These competing forces sheds light on the contradictory findings related to the economic benefits of CE implementation.According to the seminal work of Zhu and Sarkis (2004) on green supply chain management, economic performance outcomes include both negative and positive aspects.

        <p>In this research, we do not consider the short-term negative impact of investments for CE and CSCM; rather, we employ the NRBV as a theoretical lens to hypothesize the performance outcomes of CSCM implementation, focusing on long-term performance indicators which are likely to reflect a sustainable competitive advantage. Moreover, for analysis purposes, we divide the broad aspect of economic performance into two dimensions i.e., cost performance and financial performance. Cost performance focuses on costs related to operational efficiency such as materials purchasing cost, energy costs, and fees for waste water discharge and treatment (Pullman et al., 2009;Zhu and Sarkis, 2004). Financial performance focuses on overall profitability indicators such as return ratios, earnings and profit (Flynn et al., 2010;Paulraj et al., 2017) to assess the financial performance outcomes of CSCM. Thus, we hypothesize the following:In this research, we do not consider the short-term negative impact of investments for CE and CSCM; rather, we employ the NRBV as a theoretical lens to hypothesize the performance outcomes of CSCM implementation, focusing on long-term performance indicators which are likely to reflect a sustainable competitive advantage.

        <p>Drawing upon the contingent NRBV, the contextual role of industry and how it affects the adoption of environmental management strategies has been a scholarly interest in the recent years (Hartmann and Vachon, 2018). We argue that the contextual factors, i.e., uncertainty or dynamism, complexity and munificence, identified in the contingent NRBV theory are inherent in an EIP setting. Firstly, firms operating inside EIPs can experience a high degree of dynamism or uncertainty, which makes it difficult for managers to understand or predict the effect of changes in the business environment (Aragón-Correa and Sharma, 2003). For example, the availability, volume and quality of material and/or waste exchange in EIPs is typically more in the control of the waste producers than of the waste users, creating and a potential mismatch of demand and supply. From a contingent NRBV perspective, when faced with dynamism or uncertainty, firms try to develop capabilities and reconfigure their resources that allow them to stay competitive (Aragón-Correa and Sharma, 2003). Secondly, firms inside EIPs become engaged in so-called industrial symbiosis which refers to a complex interaction of "traditionally separate industries in a collective approach to competitive advantage involving physical exchange of materials, energy, water, and/or by-products" (Chertow, 2000, p. 313). In this regard, the contingent NRBV perspective argues for managing complexity by introducing incremental changes (Aragón-Correa and Sharma, 2003). Others propose that increased complexity allows firms to leverage and develop their internal capabilities, thus making them more competitive (Mar Fuentes-Fuentes et al., 2004).

According to reports, the environmental performance (including eco-efficiency) in many EIPs has improved, besides creating huge savings on raw material purchase and waste disposal costs (Mathews et al., 2018). For example, in the Chinese province of Guangxi, a typical EIP saves more than 2 million tonnes of CO2 emissions annually by reducing energy usage and circulating materials (Sun et al., 2017).

        <p>According to the RBV, availability of resources or capabilities greatly influences what the firm can and cannot do because the formulation and implementation of strategies require a commitment of scarce resources (Pullman et al., 2009).

        <p>CE implementation and/or adoption varies between industries as some industries may have a comparative advantage over others in lending themselves to more circular initiatives. For example, recirculation of metal scrap is much easier when compared to extracting metal from industrial sludge, which requires chemical treatment (Van Wassenhove, 2019). Moreover, given the high levels of variations in resource recovery procedures and waste management activities in different industries, firms might need distinct supply chain players to collaborate for circular initiatives (Farooque et al., 2019a). A conceptual model of the study is presented in Figure 1. which is appropriate when the population has little variation (Saunders et al., 2019). The approach is justifiable for this study because business cultures in the multiple regions in China are relatively homogeneous. The Chinese central government has tight controls over the making and the implementation of the laws, including the Circular Economy Promotion Law. Individual provinces in China have very limited legislation power. A top-down approach is also the norm for the implementation of business and economic development policies. Our survey methodology is contextually appropriate and in line with previous studies (Zhu et al., 2011;Zhu and Sarkis, 2004) where authors have used non-random sampling methods due to difficulties in obtaining data for organizational practices in the Chinese manufacturing industry.CE implementation and/or adoption varies between industries as some industries may have a comparative advantage over others in lending themselves to more circular initiatives.

An effort was made to collect data from two respondents (i.e., matched response) per organization: one for the independent variables and one for the dependent variables. For this reason, the survey questionnaire was comprised of two parts. Part 1 included questions on dependent variables and required response from a senior executive working in the department of administration, strategy, finance, or performance, or someone who was familiar with the overall performance of the firm. Similarly, part 2 included questions on independent variables and required response from a senior executive working in the department of operations, supply chain or someone who was familiar with overall operational activities of the firm.

An effort was made to collect data from two respondents (i.e., matched response) per organization: one for the independent variables and one for the dependent variables. For this reason, the survey questionnaire was comprised of two parts. Part 1 included questions on dependent variables and required response from a senior executive working in the department of administration, strategy, finance, or performance, or someone who was familiar with the overall performance of the firm. Similarly, part 2 included questions on independent variables and required response from a senior executive working in the department of operations, supply chain or someone who was familiar with overall operational activities of the firm. Respondents were asked to consider a same business unit while responding to survey items in both parts.</p>
        <p>Out of 930 questionnaires distributed via all channels to various manufacturing firms, a total of 360 was returned (response rate = 38.7%). Around 110 individual respondents raised queries and wrote some additional comments about their companies' CSCM practices. Our survey sample covered all of the six greater administrative areas of China. All the questionnaires were scrutinized, and a large proportion of responses (nearly 30% of collected responses) were rejected based on their response to screening items (i.e., attentiveness to scale variations), response patterns and missing data (Edwards, 2019). Overall, these efforts ensured the rigor of the data collection process for obtaining quality data. A final sample of 255 responses meeting the assumptions related to normality, constant variance and outliers, was considered appropriate to be used for analysis purposes. Table 2 provides a summary of sample distribution.

        <p>A data triangulation process was employed to ensure the rigor of the research results. After the survey, three focus group meetings and six face-to-face interviews were organized with selected participants to discuss the survey results. In order to meet the anonymity and ethical requirements of the survey process, the focus group and interview participants were selected among those who consented to participate in post-survey meetings. Preference was given to senior managers in large and mediumsized enterprises who possessed good knowledge of the industry. To allow in-depth discussions, each focus group meeting involved only three participants besides the researcher. Each meeting lasted about one and a half hours. Similarly, the face-to-face interviews involved senior level participants including three officials from the local government and three representatives from the industry. In general, the participants were asked to comment on the validity of the survey results, and to discuss their organizations' CE practices and their implications for cost and financial performance. This qualitative process provided valuable insights into the validity and robustness of the survey results as well as their interpretations. We modeled CSCM as a second-order construct reflected by four first-order constructs, namely, circular product design, circular procurement, cleaner production, and EoL product and waste management, to capture a holistic view of CSCM adoption and implementation. A five-point Likert scale was used for items measuring CSCM. The respondents were asked to evaluate the extent of CSCM practices implementation in their respective organizations in the last year on the scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (to full extent).A data triangulation process was employed to ensure the rigor of the research results.

        <p>Given that a survey involving a matched response in SCM research is quite challenging, we allowed a single respondent to fill in the questionnaire if a matched response was not possible. In such cases, a greater attention to respondent selection criteria was followed as recommended by Montabon et al. (2018) to select single best respondent with the requisite knowledge. As a result, we ended up receiving a mix of matched responses (n=75) and a single respondent (n=180) based questionnaires. Similarly, the survey was distributed equally among firms located inside and/or outside an EIP. The final sample included responses from firms located inside (n= 103) and outside (n= 152) an EIP. Hence, to ensure an unbiased sample for this study, initially we performed a t-test comparing both response types and firm's location and found no significant statistical difference.Given that a survey involving a matched response in SCM research is quite challenging, we allowed a single respondent to fill in the questionnaire if a matched response was not possible.

        <p>To further validate this claim, we conducted a chi-square difference test. The CFA was subjected to a two-stage multigroup analysis (MGA) (Bollen, 2014;Jöreskog, 1998) run separately for both the grouping variables (i.e., response type and firm's location). In the first stage, all the parameters were estimated freely in their respective groups, whereas, the second stage involved constraining the parameters to be equal across the groups. Applying the conventional cut-off value of 0.05, the MGA results indicate similar patterns of measurement relationships among the groups. Thus, our analysis did not suggest any significant difference or moderating effect.To further validate this claim, we conducted a chi-square difference test.

        <p>Firstly, the survey was anonymous and self-administered. The respondents were ensured that no answers would be identifiable by individuals or organizations. Secondly, we separated the measurements related to the dependent and independent variables into two different parts, also known as "split survey method", requiring a response from two different respondents within the same organization (Dubey et al., 2015). However, due to the anticipated challenges in getting matched responses from manufacturing firms, a single respondent was also allowed to respond to the whole questionnaire in case a matched response was not possible. Thirdly, we used different variations at the construct and measurement scale levels to help mitigate the CMB concerns including social desirability.Firstly, the survey was anonymous and self-administered.

        <p>At the construct level, we used organization rather than the individual as a proxy subject when referring to CSCM practices (Nederhof, 1985) following Pullman et al. (2009)'s example. Similarly, at the measurement scale level, we used different measurement scales in the questionnaire to eliminate the impact of consistency in the response patterns. For example, the scale used for cost performance variables implied response in terms of lower cost as a means to achieve better performance, whereas the same scale implied response in terms of increased use of renewable energy, restored (non-virgin) materials and higher profits, as an indication of better performance.At the construct level, we used organization rather than the individual as a proxy subject when referring to CSCM practices (Nederhof, 1985) following Pullman et al.

        <p>As the majority of data (approx. 70%) for this study was obtained from a single source (i.e., one respondent from each participating firm) using a self-report questionnaire, CMB may be a concern (Guide and Ketokivi, 2015). Based on the MGA, the results from the single respondent group were not statistically different from the matched response group; therefore, a major concern related to CMB was not indicated. However, to detect the presence and severity of CMB, we performed three tests: firstly, we conducted Harman's (1976) single-factor test in which we performed an un-rotated factor analysis with eigenvalues greater than 1. The test results showed the presence of six different factors, whereas the first factor explained only a fraction of the variance (26.9%) in the data. Secondly, we performed a common latent factor test by introducing a latent factor to the original measurement model (Podsakoff et al., 2003); Podsakoff et al. (2012). The results showed that the fit for the original measurement model (i.e., χ2/df = 1.58, CFI = 0.95, and RMESA = 0.05) was similar to the fit for the model including the common latent factor (i.e., χ2/df = 1.45, CFI = 0.96, and RMESA = 0.04). We conducted a third test as recommended by Widaman (1985). We tested two latent variable modelsa measurement model with traits only and another with an addition of a method factor along with the traits. Using the CFI change cutoff criterion of 0.01 (Cheung and Rensvold, 2002), the model fit indices do not show significant improvement. Also, the path coefficients and their significance were indifferent between the two models, suggesting that they were robust despite including a methods factor. Based on this we conclude that CMB is unlikely to influence the validity of results presented in this study.As the majority of data (approx. 70%) for this study was obtained from a single source (i.e., one respondent from each participating firm) using a self-report questionnaire, CMB may be a concern (Guide and Ketokivi, 2015).

        <p>Both exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used to assess convergent validity. EFA loadings (all above 0.50) as presented in Table 4 suggest that our measurement items show an adequate level convergent validity (Hair et al., 2006). In CFA, we used two different measurement models for measuring the independent and dependent factors, as different scale anchors were used for independent and dependent indicators (Paulraj et al., 2017).

        <p>As mentioned in section 4, focus group meetings were held for validating survey results and to aid researchers' interpretations of the results.

        <p>Such facilities often required big investments and thus increased business costs in short term. This explains why some firms found CE implementation economically challenging, as identified by Genovese et al. (2017) and Nasir et al. (2017). However, the incurred short-term costs did not necessarily make an implementing firm less cost competitive, because its domestic competitors were subject to the same regulatory requirements and had to incur similar costs. Therefore, we infer that while CE implementation did incur a substantial upfront cost, it undermined a firm's cost competitiveness only when its competitors were located where there are less stringent environmental regulations. Over long term, implementing firms observed economic benefits in reduced energy cost and waste treatment fees. However, the level of CE implementation by these reactive firms is usually not at an advanced stage as their motivation was mere regulatory compliance.Such facilities often required big investments and thus increased business costs in short term.

        <p>Proactive firms were the firms that took their own initiatives to optimize their production and supply chain operations. Their CE implementation was not driven by regulatory pressures as their reactive counterparts. In contrast, they actively listened to the voice of the market, sought to improve environmental as well as cost and financial performance to stay ahead of their competitors. They often had a designated organizational unit and a team of specialists to drive and coordinate improvement initiatives. They proactively sought for cost savings opportunities in CSCM practices. They found innovative ways to remanufacture products and components, to reuse parts and raw materials, and to design packaging that is easier for return, reuse and recycling. They invested in smart enabling technologies, for example, QR code for tracing. They designed positive and negative incentives to encourage the reuse and recycling of parts, raw materials and packaging to improve profit margins.Proactive firms were the firms that took their own initiatives to optimize their production and supply chain operations.

        <p>Furthermore, the competitive dynamics in the Chinese manufacturing industries was found to be a key factor that caused the effect of CE implementation on financial performance to be much greater and significant than on cost performance. Most Chinese manufacturers mainly competed on price and they faced stiff competition in both domestic and international markets. A slight cost advantage can lead to considerable price competitiveness, which results in much greater sales opportunities and profits. This means the impact of improved cost performance is disproportionally high on financial performance, and the effect is shown clearly in the survey study results.Furthermore, the competitive dynamics in the Chinese manufacturing industries was found to be a key factor that caused the effect of CE implementation on financial performance to be much greater and significant than on cost performance.

The interview participants also confirmed the validity of study results (especially H1 and H2) that the main effect is from CSCM to economic performance, not the other way round.

        <p>These results, further supported by post-survey analysis, are in agreement with the proponents of CE, including the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, that CSCM (built on CE building blocks), when exercised as a uniform strategy, can improve firm performance. Although the results suggest that Chinese manufacturers have adopted CSCM to some extent (mean value of above 3 indicates reasonable adoption), it is still not at a high level. This is understandable given that CE implementation has predominantly been considered at macro (i.e., national/regional/city) and meso levels (i.e., EIPs) (Ghisellini et al., 2016), whereas, the implementation of CE at a micro level (i.e., firm or supply chain) remains unclear (Farooque et al., 2019b). This research provides a comprehensive and holistic view of CE implementation at a firm and supply chain level; the CSCM construct and practices within could be considered as a starting point towards further development of circular supply chains leading to better economic performance.These results, further supported by post-survey analysis, are in agreement with the proponents of CE, including the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, that CSCM (built on CE building blocks), when exercised as a uniform strategy, can improve firm performance.

        <p>For H3 (sig &lt; 0.05), our results show significant support (see Table 6). This outcome provides empirical evidence that firms inside EIPs have adopted CSCM at higher levels when compared to those outside EIPs. This result confirms Mathews et al.'s (2018) viewpoint on the role of EIPs in fostering CE implementation at the firm and supply chain level.

        <p>This suggests that performance is mainly driven by practices. However, underlying differences between firm' operations in an industrial symbiosis network and a typical supply chain network may contribute to the lack of moderation, as evidenced in H4. Industrial symbiosis network partners are not necessarily firms' core supply chain partners; therefore, material exchange between industrial symbiosis partners may not be as effective as other important factors related to supply, such as its availability when needed in the right volume and with the right quality. Moreover, firms operating inside EIPs need to integrate the park administrative authorities' requirements into their supply chain activities (Zhu et al., 2015).This suggests that performance is mainly driven by practices.

In doing so, our study contributes to further development of the NRBV framework in three ways. Firstly, it is among the first to link the CSCM perspective, with the NRBV framework.

        <p>Our study offers several practical implications. Firstly, managers should view CSCM at a firm and supply chain level as an integrated system rather than a set of standalone practices. In circular supply chains, the products are intentionally designed for circularity throughout their life cycle. This means the materials used in products are not meant to be scrapped at the end of their life cycle, thus creating no waste. Further, material resources needed for circular products are mainly sourced from EoL materials that would otherwise be discarded. In this way, the two functional ends of circular supply chains (i.e., circular product design and EoL product and waste management activities) are the most critical functions of SCM to establish circularity. Purchasing practices of firms (circular procurement) in circular supply chains should focus on sourcing to form closed loops of energy and material with minimal or no waste creation and/or negative environment impacts. Production practices (cleaner production) must ensure material efficiency, energy conservation, waste, and emissions reduction at the highest level.Our study offers several practical implications.

        <p>However, there are several challenges in managing the closed-loop material flows and material circularity. Recent advancement in digital technologies such as blockchain and big data analytics (BDA) may help with managing and monitoring the circulation of materials in the supply chains (Choi et al., 2018;Wang and Sarkis, 2021). Blockchain technology can help to improve the product returns and EoL products and waste management activities in reverse supply chains by effective tracing of materials (Dutta et al., 2020) thereby promoting material recovery and circularity which is at the heart of CSCM.However, there are several challenges in managing the closed-loop material flows and material circularity.

        <p>Secondly, the CSCM-to-firm performance relationship is confirmed supporting the view expressed by Van Wassenhove (2019) that businesses cannot trade-off lower economic performance for improved social or environmental outcomes. In this regard, our results demonstrate practical relevance as firms implementing CSCM benefit economically as well as environmentally. The results provide empirical evidence to dispel contradictory findings with regard to the economic viability of CE at a firm and supply chain level (Genovese et al., 2017;Zhu et al., 2011). With this clarity, supply chain leaders can confidently develop strategies and adopt CSCM practices to further enhance firm performance (Chen et al., 2021;Liu et al., 2021). The strategic considerations may also include business model innovations such as product-service systems where businesses shift their tenets from the delivery of physical products only to providing integrated product-service offerings in the form of leasing or renting (Wang et al., 2020).Secondly, the CSCM-to-firm performance relationship is confirmed supporting the view expressed by Van Wassenhove (2019) that businesses cannot trade-off lower economic performance for improved social or environmental outcomes.

        <p>Thirdly, despite the potential benefits of CE implementation most firms and supply chains cannot fully realize these benefits because of challenges in resource recirculation, restoration and recovery within their supply chain structures. EIPs' are a potential solution for these challenges. Although being located in an EIP does not directly affect firm performance, it encourages the adoption and implementation of CSCM practices because location proximity makes it easier for EIP firms to collaborate in resource exchanges. However, the Chinese model of EIP system and development has its own shortcomings (Huang et al., 2019) and there is a further need to improve resource circularity performance.

        <p>do not support a moderating role of EIP location in the CSCM-to-performance relationship. A possible explanation may be the lack of exclusive incentives in the current Chinese EIP management system for the EIPs and the firms operating inside them (Huang et al., 2019). The central and local governments in China offer several policy incentives such as tax reductions and subsidies for all firms irrespective of their locations to promote CE implementation. Many Chinese EIPs offer incentives to attract new firms to join in, but such incentives are available for a short period only. Li et al. (2020b) found that economic incentives have greatly influenced the promotion and uptake of various policies/initiatives such as electric vehicles adoption in China. Therefore, it is likely that more and exclusive economic incentives, if offered for EIPs and participating firms, can further enhance the CSCM adoption and performance outcomes.do not support a moderating role of EIP location in the CSCM-to-performance relationship.

        <p>Lastly, CE is a multifaceted domain and its implementation requires coordinated efforts from various stakeholders, including governments at different levels, industries, local businesses, non-governmental organizations, and customers, to cooperate in stewarding valuable resources for the best outcomes.Lastly, CE is a multifaceted domain and its implementation requires coordinated efforts from various stakeholders, including governments at different levels, industries, local businesses, non-governmental organizations, and customers, to cooperate in stewarding valuable resources for the best outcomes.</p>
        <p>Given the robustness of practice-performance relationship in supply chains, firms need to develop systemic sustainability collaborations for circularity, focusing both on the business processes and the outcomes (Nidumolu et al., 2014). For example, firms can systemically collaborate with carefully selected stakeholders (e.g., municipal waste management authorities or retailers) with an explicit focus on improving processes (i.e., EoL product and waste management) or an outcome (i.e., resource consumption) to tackle complex challenges. Firms operating inside EIPs have a unique advantage as the industrial symbiosis environment provides a natural form of collaboration required for circularity.Given the robustness of practice-performance relationship in supply chains, firms need to develop systemic sustainability collaborations for circularity, focusing both on the business processes and the outcomes (Nidumolu et al., 2014).

Overall, these results suggest that our original model with CSCM as a second-order construct is more suitable and robust.</p>
        <p>Given the possibility that firms demonstrating higher levels of CSCM adoption may be endogenously influenced by firms' better cost and financial performance, we conducted endogeneity tests-a two-stage least square (2SLS) regression analysis with instrumental variable followed by Durbin-Wu-Hausman postestimation test of endogeneity-as recommended by Lu et al. (2018). According to Deaton (2010); Rossi (2014), a good instrumental variable ideally should have a strong correlation with the suspected explanatory variables but not with the disturbance term. In the large survey data set, we identified coercive isomorphism, a sub-variable of institutional isomorphism (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983) to be used as an instrumental variable in endogeneity tests. Institutional theory seeks to explain how the influence of external, social, political and economic pressures affect organizational strategies, decisions and actions (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983). It identifies three mechanisms through which institutional isomorphic changes occur, namely, coercive isomorphism, mimetic isomorphism, and normative isomorphism. In the Chinese context, coercive isomorphism plays an influential role in CSCM adoption and implementation in the form of stringent laws and regulations imposed by the Chinese government.Given the possibility that firms demonstrating higher levels of CSCM adoption may be endogenously influenced by firms' better cost and financial performance, we conducted endogeneity tests-a two-stage least square (2SLS) regression analysis with instrumental variable followed by Durbin-Wu-Hausman postestimation test of endogeneity-as recommended by Lu et al.

        <p>We performed correlation analysis to confirm that coercive isomorphism was only correlated to CSCM (R=0.31 at p&lt;0.01) and did not significantly correlate with cost and financial performance. Thus, validating its place as an instrumental variable.We performed correlation analysis to confirm that coercive isomorphism was only correlated to CSCM (R=0.31 at p&lt;0.01) and did not significantly correlate with cost and financial performance.
