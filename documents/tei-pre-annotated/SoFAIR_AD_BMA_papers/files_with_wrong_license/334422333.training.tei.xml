        <p>The smart manufacturing systems (SMS) offer several advantages compared to the traditional manufacturing systems and are increasingly being adopted by manufacturing organizations as a strategy to improve their performance. Developing an SMS is expensive and complicated, integrating together various technologies such as automation, data exchanges, cyber-physical systems (CPS), artificial intelligence, internet of things (IoT), and semi-autonomous industrial systems. The Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs) have limited resources and therefore, would like to see the benefits from investments before allowing adopting SMS. This study uses a combination of exploratory and empirical research design to identify and validate the performance measures relevant to the evaluation of SMS investments in auto-component manufacturing SMMEs based in India. The study found that an Industry 4.0 enabled SMS offer more competitive benefits compared to a traditional manufacturing system. The planned investments in SMS can be evaluated on ten performance dimensions namely, cost, quality, flexibility, time, integration, optimized productivity, real-time diagnosis &amp; prognosis, computing, social and ecological sustainability. Proposed novel Smart Manufacturing Performance Measurement System (SMPMS) framework is expected to guide the practitioners in SMMEs to evaluate their SMS investments.The smart manufacturing systems (SMS) offer several advantages compared to the traditional manufacturing systems and are increasingly being adopted by manufacturing organizations as a strategy to improve their performance.

        <p>Small, Medium and Micro enterprises (SMMEs) have helped to accelerate economic development in Asia (Ndubisi et al., 2020). Along with the large enterprises, they are also adopting Industry 4.0 technologies for improved performance. Industry 4.0 is the latest trend in the manufacturing technologies that transform the existing manufacturing systems to Smart Manufacturing Systems (SMS) through the support of automation, data exchanges, cyberphysical systems (CPS), cloud computing, robotics, big data, artificial intelligence, internet of things (IoT) and semi-autonomous industrial techniques (Kamble et al., 2018a). The manufacturing goals achieved by the Industry 4.0 lies in the intersection of people, technologies and innovation. With tremendous development in the field of manufacturing and data analytics technologies (Zhang et al., 2019;Qu et al., 2019). Much of these developments are focused on digital manufacturing systems and artificial intelligence techniques, transforming the systems to become smart and intelligent (Edgar and Pistikopoulos, 2018).Small, Medium and Micro enterprises (SMMEs) have helped to accelerate economic development in Asia (Ndubisi et al., 2020).

        <p>The SMS generates a considerable amount of data; however, the use and volume of the data collected vary across the industries, their scale, and operations (Kusiak, 2017). Zheng et al. (2018) identified significant applications of SMS in design, machining, monitoring, control and scheduling. The use of computer-aided design and manufacturing software, immersive and non-invasive hybrid prototyping technologies-such as augmented reality (AR) and visual reality (VR) and the ability to interact within the cyber-physical systems in a manufacturing environment help companies to establish smart design architectures (Kamble et al., 2018a). The SMS eliminates the need for post-process quality inspections and enables a self-optimization control system with the use of sensors, IoT, machine learning and cloud computing technologies (Stoyanov et al., 2019). The deployment of IoT provides SMS the capability for real-time monitoring and control, resulting in the improved quality of operations, reduction in product and machine failures and development of optimal schedules (He et al., 2019;Liang et al., 2019).The SMS generates a considerable amount of data; however, the use and volume of the data collected vary across the industries, their scale, and operations (Kusiak, 2017).

        <p>Several organizations are implementing Industry 4.0 technologies to address the challenges of increasing manufacturing complexity (Oh and Jeong, 2019). The real-time based technologies transform the reactive operational approach of the manufacturing facilities into a proactive approach (Davis et al., 2012). Jung et al. (2015) report that for the SMS to be efficient, they need to be able to respond to the information quickly and effectively, and in the process may disrupt the ongoing operations.Several organizations are implementing Industry 4.0 technologies to address the challenges of increasing manufacturing complexity (Oh and Jeong, 2019).

        <p>The SMS need to be agile and able to meet the rigorous performance requirements to become successful in achieving their implementation goals. No doubt that the implementation Few research studies have proposed a performance measurement framework for Industry 4.0 based manufacturing systems (Shin et al., 2018;Miragliotta et al., 2018;Bauters et al., 2018;Ante et al., 2018;Emmer et al., 2018). However, the proposed performance measures in these studies are limited to the evaluation of a specific performance dimension; such as data quality, productivity or product quality. Moreover, these studies used literature reviews or case study approaches and lack in providing empirical validity for the measures. There is a need to conduct empirical studies seeking practitioners' views on the adequacy and applicability of performance dimensions in the Industry 4.0 context (Frederico et al., 2020). Thus, a significant knowledge gap is evident in developing a holistic performance measurement system for SMS within the context of Industry 4.0. Accordingly, this paper aims to address the research gap in the literature by identifying the performance measures using a combination of literature review and empirical validation. The empirical validation in this study is performed on selected Industry practitioners from SMMEs in India. This is relevant considering the substantial investment costs in implementing Industry 4.0 based SMS and the limited financing options available to the SMMEs (Gawankar et al., 2020;Kiel et al., 2017a;2017b). The SMMEs would prefer to apply SMS in gradual steps and see the results before proceeding further with holistic implementation. The contribution of SMMEs towards a country's economic and social development is high (Ndubisi et al., 2020), and SMS implementation will provide a considerable stimulus for the nation's growth. The performance measures identified in this study are expected to support and foster the speed of Industry 4.0 enabled SMS implementation in SMMEs.

        <p>The SMMEs are continually looking forward to enhancing their competitiveness by adopting Industry 4.0 technologies (Mashelkar, 2018). There exists a significant economic potential for the SMMEs to transform into smart factories, integrating information communication technologies (ICT) and CPS with manufacturing, logistics, and supply chain planning (Lee and Lapira, 2013;Ndubisi et al., 2020). In India, the SMMEs are the major contributors to industrial development, with a share of 40% in industrial production and 35% of the total manufactured exports (Mathur, 2019). The literature identifies pressure on SMMEs to achieve continuous quality improvements, extensive manual interventions in processes, interrupted data flow and lack of skilled workforce as the critical barriers for implementing Industry 4.0 technologies (Kamble et al., 2018b). The Government of India is supporting the SMMEs to develop SMS through various initiatives such as 'Make in India,' 'Technological up-gradation,' and 'Establishment of facilitation centers.' The government is in the process of developing a regulatory framework that is more conducive for enabling an Industry 4.0 ecosystem in the country (KPMG-AIMA, 2018).The SMMEs are continually looking forward to enhancing their competitiveness by adopting Industry 4.0 technologies (Mashelkar, 2018).

        <p>In India, the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are classified in two classes as per the provision of the MSMEs Development Act, 2006 of the Government of India. The first class pertains to the "enterprises that are engaged in the manufacturing or production of goods or employing plant and machinery in the process of value addition to the final product having a distinct name or character or use" (Ministry of MSME, 2019). The second class includes the "enterprises engaged in providing or rendering of services and are defined in terms of investment in equipment" (Ministry of MSME, 2019). The limit of investments that are used to categorize these enterprises into micro, small and medium categories is presented in Table 1. (Ndubisi, 2008;Ndubisi et al., 2020).In India, the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are classified in two classes as per the provision of the MSMEs Development Act, 2006 of the Government of India.

        <p>The present status of SMMEs in India reveals that medium-sector enterprises have more matured technology than micro and small-scale enterprises (Mathur, 2019). The huge upfront investment cost in technology is identified as a significant barrier to SMS adoption (Kamble et al., 2018b). Understandably, the SMMEs prefers to invest in such systems using a step-by-step approach as these SMMEs are constrained with the budget and, therefore, would see the benefits from the investments before allowing their management, customers, and employees to adopt the technology (Ndubisi, 2008). Thus, the focus of this study is to provide a validated set of performance measures and a performance measurement system for the SMMEs to manage successful SMS implementation.The present status of SMMEs in India reveals that medium-sector enterprises have more matured technology than micro and small-scale enterprises (Mathur, 2019).

        <p>Performance measurement is defined as "the process of quantifying the efficiency and effectiveness of action" (Neely et al., 1995). The performance measures should support improving organizational performance and create a supportive work environment (Bititci et al., 2005).Performance measurement is defined as "the process of quantifying the efficiency and effectiveness of action" (Neely et al., 1995).

        <p>Majority of the previous studies have developed performance measures and metrics for overall supply chain management (Gunasekaran et al., 2001;Bititci et al. 2005;Shepherd and Günter 2006). Although these studies offered some performance measures for manufacturing systems, the primary focus of these studies was supply chain performance measures.Majority of the previous studies have developed performance measures and metrics for overall supply chain management (Gunasekaran et al., 2001;Bititci et al. 2005;Shepherd and Günter 2006).

        <p>The measurement of manufacturing performance is a challenging task because of the diverse and multi-dimensional nature of manufacturing. Hon (2005) Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) as one of the critical metrics in performance measurement (Mathur et al., 2011). The maintenance performance measures, such as condition-based maintenance and reliability-centered maintenance were found to create value for the organizations (Kumar et al., 2013). While classifying 73 measures into twelve performance dimensions, Gosselin (2005) found that manufacturing organizations prefer financial measures over the non-financial measures (Gosselin, 2005). Kamble and Gunasekaran (2020) The measurement systems should be dynamic and align manufacturing strategy to drive competitive and innovative performance (Hon, 2005). The above discussions suggest that the performance measures have evolved with the changing environment, and the recent advancements in the Industry 4.0 technologies are offering new possibilities to monitor and control performance in real-time. This justifies the need to review and validate relevant performance measures for the SMS.The measurement of manufacturing performance is a challenging task because of the diverse and multi-dimensional nature of manufacturing.

        <p>The literature reveals that the reduction in manufacturing costs is one of the critical focus of SMS. The performance measures used to demonstrate the benefits of SMS are general cost measures that are used in the traditional manufacturing systems and included profit (Pistolesi et al., 2019;Roy et al., 2015), work-in-process cost (Fan et al., 2019), energy cost (Gadaleta et al. 2019;Edgar and Pistikopoulos, 2018), maintenance cost (Vogl et al., 2019), waste treatment cost (Santos et al., 2019) and inventory cost (Chen and Kuo, 2019;Castellano et al., 2019).The literature reveals that the reduction in manufacturing costs is one of the critical focus of SMS.

        <p>Most of the above studies compared the SMS performance with the traditional manufacturing systems on the cost measures and claimed that an SMS performs far better than a conventional manufacturing system offering higher cost-saving benefits (Alqahtani et al., 2019;Gadaleta et al., 2019).Most of the above studies compared the SMS performance with the traditional manufacturing systems on the cost measures and claimed that an SMS performs far better than a conventional manufacturing system offering higher cost-saving benefits (Alqahtani et al., 2019;Gadaleta et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>The use of information and communication technologies such as IoT, machine learning and predictive analytics enable SMS to perform real-time monitoring and proactive control of the products, processes and equipment. The predictive capability of SMS makes them superior to the traditional manufacturing systems, enabling the SMS to detect product failure in real-time (He et al., 2019;Liang et al., 2019), predict the remaining useful life of the machine (Kumar et al., 2019;He et al., 2019), early process fault detection (Carvajal Soto et al., 2019) and process visualizations (Qian et al., 2019). Further, the SMS performs efficiently on the measures of warranty claims by the customers (Alqhatani et al., 2019), reduced scrap (Chauhan et al., 2019;Rajput and Singh, 2019), the defective product (Kucukogulo et al., 2018;Kang et al., 2018) and inspection errors (Kang et al., 2018;Uva et al., 2018). The SMS promotes supply chain integration by developing the superior quality of supplier relationships, collaborative partnerships (Longo et al., 2019;Wang et al., 2019b) and improved customer satisfaction (Petrillo et al., 2017).The use of information and communication technologies such as IoT, machine learning and predictive analytics enable SMS to perform real-time monitoring and proactive control of the products, processes and equipment.

        <p>The Industry 4.0 technologies and architectures are required to connect and extend the physical factory operations with the cyber world needing greater information consistency, data reliability, information privacy and security (O'Donovan et al., 2019). Zhao et al. (2019) suggest the use of advanced ICT and IoT for effective implementation of SMS for improved product traceability and information security. Data storage capacity, lack of human skills, information privacy and high latency are significant challenges that affect the performance of an SMS (Li et al., 2019). The highly secured network is identified as a critical requirement for managing the human-robot collaboration in enhancing SMS performance (Khalid et al., 2018). Hence, for the efficient performance of SMS, it is critical to have a reliable data management system that includes data collection, data transfer, data storage and data analytical capabilities.The Industry 4.0 technologies and architectures are required to connect and extend the physical factory operations with the cyber world needing greater information consistency, data reliability, information privacy and security (O'Donovan et al., 2019).

        <p>The impact of technological advancements on the human resources have also received attention in the literature (Pinzone et al., 2019;Eimontaile et al., 2019;Kamble et al., 2020c;Tortorella et al., 2020). Pinzone et al. (2019) suggest that SMS supports building a robust social environment enabling improved employee health, learning and operative performance. The technologies such as virtual and augmented reality accelerate employee learning, thus reducing the work pressure and increase in morale (Uva et al., 2018;Kamble et al., 2018;Blanco-Novoa et al., 2018). The other human factors on which the SMS performance could be evaluated are reduced human efforts &amp; anxiety, improved working conditions and non-invasive interventions (Kamble et al., 2018;Roldan et al., 2019;Eimontaile et al., 2019).

        <p>SMS encourages the use of advanced optimization and simulation techniques because of the availability of a considerable amount of data that is generated in real-time at different locations in the manufacturing supply chains. The literature reveals that the prescriptive analytical techniques have been deployed extensively in SMS to optimize the machining processes (Liang et al., 2019;Zhao et al., 2017;Biondi et al., 2018), plant and warehouse layouts (Banyai et al., 2019;Peruzzini et al., 2019), use of materials (Chauhan et al., 2019;Meng et al., 2018), workstation design (Pistolesi et al., 2018) and workflows (Tufano et al., 2018).

        <p>In the traditional manufacturing systems, flexibility is evaluated on various performance measures that include the system flexibility in terms of product mix, delivery, process, machine, and volume. However, SMS extends these flexibility performance measures to include the ability to execute real-time job scheduling (Saif et al., 2019;Fan et al., 2019;Framinan et al., 2019) real-time design and engineering changes (Davis et al., 2012), real-time monitoring of customer orders (Qu et al., 2019;Petrillo et al., 2019), and real-time supply status of products (Longo et al., 2019;Oh and Jeong 2018). Hence, the SMS performs efficiently on providing real-time flexibility to the manufacturing organizations, enabling them to make real-time decisions on various aspects such as interaction with the suppliers, internal customers, and the end customers.In the traditional manufacturing systems, flexibility is evaluated on various performance measures that include the system flexibility in terms of product mix, delivery, process, machine, and volume.

        <p>The research on performance measurement systems for Industry 4.0 is scarce, with limited research studies attempting to develop evaluation systems for smart manufacturing projects in Although above discussed studies in the literature have attempted to establish measurement systems in the Industry 4.0 context, the measures considered by them are not comprehensive and directed towards a specific performance dimension. Further, these studies have used conceptual frameworks or case studies within the organization to develop the measurement system, lacking empirical validation of the identified measures.The research on performance measurement systems for Industry 4.0 is scarce, with limited research studies attempting to develop evaluation systems for smart manufacturing projects in Although above discussed studies in the literature have attempted to establish measurement systems in the Industry 4.0 context, the measures considered by them are not comprehensive and directed towards a specific performance dimension.

        <p>The measurement items for the performance measures were developed using an extant literature review followed by an in-depth unstructured discussion with the practitioners from the manufacturing industry. The discussions with the practitioners helped us to establish the content validity of the identified measures. Similar approaches were used in the previous studies focused on developing measurement items (Parasuraman et al., 1988;Peter et al., 1982). The literature search was performed on the Scopus database using the keywords; "Smart manufacturing" and "Industry 4.0" and "Intelligent Manufacturing" and "Digital manufacturing" in pairwise comparison with "Performance measurement" and "Performance management." The initial search resulted in a total of 1469 papers, which was further reduced to 348 articles by limiting the search to papers published in academic journals in the subject categories: business management, operations management, decision sciences, and computer/technology management. Those papers that did not align with the search objectives were not considered for further review. In the end, 98 research papers were selected for the final review.

        <p>Twenty-two in-depth interviews with industry participants were conducted using open-ended questions to validate the measures identified from the literature subjectively. The practitioners were selected from five Tier-I auto-component manufacturing organizations and had prior knowledge about SMS. Out of these five participating organizations, all of them are using sensor/IoT and cloud computing-based manufacturing systems, two of them have adopted additive manufacturing, and one of them is using virtual reality for training and maintenance activities. The practitioners represented different functional backgrounds that included-manufacturing, maintenance, quality and utilities. The selected practitioners varied in experience levels and held managerial positions like-Vice-president, Chief Manager, Associate Manager, Manager, Director, etc. The practitioners were interviewed on a broad range of SMS performance measures (e.g., what measures they perceived to be necessary for evaluating SMS performance?, Are the performance measures used for traditional manufacturing systems relevant in Industry 4.0 environment?) Few measures were added and some dropped based on the recommendation of the practitioners. The final list of 102 measures was subjectively classified in seven performance dimensions namely, cost, quality, productivity, flexibility, time, human and computing performance as presented in Table 2.Twenty-two in-depth interviews with industry participants were conducted using open-ended questions to validate the measures identified from the literature subjectively.

        <p>The success of Indian SMMEs is driven by auto-component manufacturing companies because of its high technological maturity and massive development prospects. The auto-component industry contributes seven percent of India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), employing around 19 million people (Arcot, 2017). The auto-component industry is expected to achieve a turnover of USD 113 billion by 2020 and become a significant manufacturing cluster in Asia (Smeventure, 2017). A report by KPMG states that the Indian automotive industry has a high robot density of 58 robots/10000 employees compared to the industry density of just three robots/10000 employees (AIMA-KPMG, 2018). Most of the Indian auto-component manufacturing organizations are in the process of adopting Industry 4.0 based SMS (Kamble et al., 2020c). The potential of auto-component SMMEs and their gradual interest in developing SMS ensured that the sample respondents are aware of the opportunities and challenges in developing SMS and qualified to participate in the survey. The online survey link was sent to 640 respondents, and 210 completed responses were obtained (32.18% response rate) representing 142 SMMEs.

        <p>In this phase, the underlying factors from Phase II were used to conduct the final survey and confirm the factor structure of the performance measures. The measurement items used in this survey were restricted to the underlying performance dimensions identified in Phase-II. A similar profile of respondents who participated in the second phase was approached for the survey. 254 respondents from 180 SMMEs participated in the online survey, which was coordinated by a local survey agency based in India. The design of the study required respondents to answer all the questions before the final submission, eliminating the issue of the incomplete questionnaire and missing values. Similar sample sizes were used in the previous studies that empirically tested the effects of Industry 4.0 technologies on an organisational performance involving around 100 measurement items (Tortorella et al., 2020;Kamble et al., 2020c). The statistical analysis in the Phase I and II was performed after averaging the items with multiple responses from a single organization to obtain a single value for each item (Venkatraman and Grant, 1986). Hence, the effective sampling unit for analysis was the number of participating SMMEs.

        <p>The measures derived from the literature review exhibited some overlap across the different performance dimensions and showed a possibility of combining a few of them. This might be due to the exploratory nature of this phase and subjectivity of the experts while validating these measures. An EFA was conducted to overcome the subjectivity involved in identifying the performance and determine the underlying dimensions (Dick and Hagerty, 1971).The measures derived from the literature review exhibited some overlap across the different performance dimensions and showed a possibility of combining a few of them.

        <p>Skewness was used to measure the symmetry of data and Kurtosis to test whether the data are heavytailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution. The maximum absolute values for Skewness and Kurtosis were 1.139 (standard error of 0.181), and 2.564 (standard error of 0.359) were within the permissible limits (Skewness &lt; 2, Kurtosis &lt; 7) indicating that the data followed a normal distribution (Curran et al., 1996). The possibility of multidimensionality of the performance measures imposed the need to compute Cronbach alpha (α) for all the seven dimensions separately. The α values helped to ascertain the measures that contributed to making up each dimension. The α values ranged from 0.54 to 0.72. Selected measures from each dimension were dropped to improve the α values within the acceptable range (above 0.70) as per the guidelines suggested for the development of new measures (Hair et al., 2014). An iterative procedure was used to increase the α values, deleting those measures with very low correlations and recomputing the new α values with a revised set of dimensions. The repeated procedure resulted in a set of 84 items, with the α values ranging between 0.76 to 0.94 across the seven dimensions.Skewness was used to measure the symmetry of data and Kurtosis to test whether the data are heavytailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution.

        <p>The next step was to examine the dimensionality of the 86 performance measures for which EFA with varimax rotation, constrained to a fixed number of factors (seven), was used. The varimax rotation is found to maximize the squared factor loadings variations for each component, providing a linear transformation to components (Dillon and Goldstein, 1984). No clear dimensions emerged from EFA as many of the items (performance measures) loaded simultaneously on several dimensions signifying that the measures overlapped or were dependent on each other. To overcome this problem, the EFA was re-run allowing the intercorrelations among the dimensions by removing the fixed factor constraint. The EFA resulted in evolving a validated set of ten performance dimensions re-assigning many of the measures from the previous dimensions. The inclusion of a performance measure in a dimension was made, if the factor loading score was above 0.5, ensuring that only the measures that contributed highly to the formation of a given factor were considered. The final list included 59 performance measures. The factor loading details of the 74 performance measures and their assigned dimension are presented in Table 3. As shown in Table 3, five of the seven dimensions developed in the first phase of the study-cost, time, flexibility, quality, and computing performance were retained with a reduced number of measures. Additionally, five new performance dimensions were evolved from the findings of the EFA viz., optimized productivity, integration, real-time diagnosis &amp; prognosis, social and ecological sustainability. .734The next step was to examine the dimensionality of the 86 performance measures for which EFA with varimax rotation, constrained to a fixed number of factors (seven), was used.

        <p>Although the EFA established the convergent validity of the measurement items in Phase II; it was necessary to confirm the statistical significance of the measurement model involving 59 performance measures in 10 dimensions. The results presented in Table 5 indicated that the measurement items have no convergent validity concerns (CSR &gt; 0.70, and AVE &gt; 0.50). Further, for all the constructs the square root AVE was higher than the correlations between that specific construct, and all the other constructs indicating that the performance dimensions had no discriminant validity issues (Cooper and Zmud, 1990;Hair et al., 2014). The CFA indicated a satisfactory model fit for the ten performance dimensions with positive degrees of freedom= 1280, χ2/df ratio = 2.49, CFI= 0.912, TLI =0.897, and RMSEA=0.081.

        <p>This study presented relevant performance measures and a performance measurement system that can be used for the assessment of SMS investments in SMMEs. The measures were identified using a combination of the exploratory and empirical validation process in the auto-component manufacturing sector. The study found that the SMMEs are convinced that the implementation of SMS will provide them with the competitive benefits of improved costs, quality, time, flexibility, optimized productivity, real-time diagnosis and prognosis, computing performance, integration, social, and ecological sustainability dimensions. SMS contributes to achieving improvements in the overall performance of the organization. Tortorella et al. (2020) identified that emerging technologies lead to an improvement in the quality of the products and customer service level satisfaction, thereby increasing the overall efficiency of the organization. However, to achieve these benefits, organizations are required to create an environment of learning and knowledge sharing. The present study statistically validated ten performance dimensions. These measures can be used by the practitioners to evaluate their SMS and build a performance-oriented manufacturing system.This study presented relevant performance measures and a performance measurement system that can be used for the assessment of SMS investments in SMMEs.

        <p>SMMEs are continually looking forward to enhancing their competitiveness by adopting innovative technological solutions. However, during the implementation of these technologies, SMMEs face issues related to economic, social, and ecological sustainability that discourages them from proceeding with the investments. The previous studies in the literature have focused on identifying the implementation drivers and barriers of such technologies in SMMEs; however, they fail to provide a comprehensive system to guide and evaluate the implementation (Kamble et al., 2018a). The main contribution of this study is to identify and develop a complete system that guides the implementation of Industry 4.0 enabled SMS in SMMEs. The Smart Manufacturing Performance Measurement System framework (presented below) is novel contribution of the study. The study extends the literature in two significant ways. Firstly, it contributes to the research of SMMEs by offering a performance measurement system that can be used to guide and evaluate the investments in innovative technologies such as Industry 4.0. Secondly, it extends the literature on Industry 4.0 by identifying a set of empirically validated performance measures to evaluate SMS performance.

        <p>The 'cost' have been one of the critical performance criteria, which finds its origin from the discipline of cost accounting. This study found ten significant cost measures that are related to the productivity and efficiency of the organizations and provide a straightforward interpretation of SMS performance. The quality measures focused on the objective parameters such as scrap, defects, and inspection quantities. The quality measures identified for evaluation of SMS investments were less in number compared to the conventional manufacturing systems, because SMS enables continuous monitoring and control of the products, processes and actors that lead to reduced quality issues. Although the exploratory study had identified twenty measures under the quality dimension, the empirical validation clustered many of these measures to form new dimensions such as real-time diagnosis &amp; prognosis and optimized productivity, which were not observed in the previous studies. Similar findings were observed for the flexibility measures wherein only five out of eighteen measures identified in the exploratory phase were retained in the empirical validation. The measures in the optimized productivity dimension focused on the optimized use of resources such as labor, materials and machines.The 'cost' have been one of the critical performance criteria, which finds its origin from the discipline of cost accounting.

        <p>The integration dimension evaluates the extent of influence SMS has on improved internal and external relationships. The finding implies that SMS should use a suitable IoT platform to integrate the suppliers, distributed manufacturing services, and manufacturing facilities to reduce the complicated manufacturing tasks. The IoT based SMS enables collaboration between the manufacturing services that are geographically distributed; and optimize the logistics routes on the dimensions of time, cost, and reliability (Wang et al., 2019b). The Industry 4.0 paradigm supported by CPS offers the SMS promising capabilities leading to effective and flexible manufacturing. It is implied that to exploit the benefits of collaborative sharing and networked manufacturing resources, the organizations should focus on automatic control of manufacturing equipment adaptively and effectively (Adamson et al., 2017).The integration dimension evaluates the extent of influence SMS has on improved internal and external relationships.

        <p>Blockchain technology is recommended for reducing information asymmetry, which has led to overcoming the issues of trust and collaboration among the supply chain partners (Longo et al., 2019;Kamble et al., 2020b). Blockchain adoption discourages counterfeiting of data and poor information quality, which have a negative influence on manufacturing performance. The use of blockchain, together with other technologies such as IoT and big data, can provide manufacturing organizations the benefit of traceability, information security, and sustainable manufacturing (Kamble et al., 2019a). However, for effective implementation of blockchain, the organizations will be required to overcome the barriers of information storage capacity and scalability, high cost of implementation, regulatory issues, and lack of skills (Zhao et al., 2019;Kamble et al., 2019a;2019b).Blockchain technology is recommended for reducing information asymmetry, which has led to overcoming the issues of trust and collaboration among the supply chain partners (Longo et al., 2019;Kamble et al., 2020b).

        <p>The measures identified in the computing performance dimension implies that the SMMEs should consider beyond cloud computing technology and consider the decentralized fog computing architectures to provide higher data consistency, reliability, privacy, and security (Chekired et al., 2018;O'Donovan et al., 2019). Fog computing is found to be an efficient technology for enabling real-time monitoring and control, reducing the delay in transmitting the information, reduced energy consumption, improved memory utilization, and throughput (Wu et al., 2017). The SMMEs have to develop an efficient computing system to provide a high level of controllability and security from vulnerable cyber-attack (Khalid et al., 2018). Frameworks based on edge computing and artificial intelligence are found to improve the resource efficiency of computing services and improve the quality of diagnostic and prognostic performance in SMS (Li et al., 2019). The SMMEs should consider moving some critical services and data from the centralized data server to the data source for enhanced computational efficiency (Yen et al., 2019) and consider use of proactive caching strategy in edge computing environment for improved goodput and real-time performance (Li et al., 2019).The measures identified in the computing performance dimension implies that the SMMEs should consider beyond cloud computing technology and consider the decentralized fog computing architectures to provide higher data consistency, reliability, privacy, and security (Chekired et al., 2018;O'Donovan et al., 2019).

        <p>The SMMEs should use immersive interface systems such as AR, VR based systems, process mining tools, and expert guidance received from the knowledgeable workers to improve the performance of the product assemblies (Roldán et al., 2019). The innovative virtual prototypes consisting of eye-tracking and wearable sensor devices are being developed for improved interactions between the workers and the digital factory. Such a human-machine interaction system should be formed by SMMEs to assist in the improvement and optimization of shop-floor operation, process workflow, workstation design, and layout (Peruzzini et al., 2019). The other developments which should be considered by the MSMEs to improve work performance and reduce the worker's anxiety include use of collaborative robots (Eimontaite et al., 2019), wearable digital assembly gloves to find defective products and processes using the vibrations and force values on the fingers ( (Eimontaite et al., 2019) Kamble, S.

        <p>The emerging technologies provide an overload of environmental information to the SMMEs. The main challenge for the SMMEs is to select the relevant ecological data and relate it to the productivity of the organization (Santos et al., 2019). High consumption of energy acts as a critical barrier for the use of industrial robots in SMS, affecting the manufacturing process sustainability. It is, therefore, essential to reduce the energy efficiency of the robotic cell, maintaining high productivity levels and manufacturing quality (Gadaleta et al., 2019). SMMEs should realize the role played by IoT in analyzing the remaining life of the assets, plan product warranty and maintenance schedules of the remanufactured products (Alqahtani et al., 2019;Meng et al., 2018;Pistolesi et al., 2018).The emerging technologies provide an overload of environmental information to the SMMEs.

        <p>Typically, there will be trade-offs engaged in adopting an SMS. For e.g., an SMMEs may consider implementing AR for employee training. This may improve the performance of the SMMEs in developing an excellent social eco-system with satisfied employees and non-invasive machine interaction. However, this may impact the SMMEs more by increased cost than is gained by the development of a social eco-system. Once the SMMEs selects the appropriate performance dimensions, the next step is to set the performance target using suitable performance measures from Table 4. Usually, several performance measures are needed to describe broader or more aggregated performance dimensions adequately. The performance targets are set against historical standards, future improvement goals or level of competition in market. The manufacturing goals and the performance targets guide the development of an SMS action plan, that may involve the implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies such as IoT, Blockchain, additive manufacturing, Big data analytics, AR/VR, etc. On application, the performance targets are needed to be closely monitored continuously and any deviations from the manufacturing goals should be addressed with an improvement plan.Typically, there will be trade-offs engaged in adopting an SMS.

        <p>The manufacturing goals should be aligned with the overall business objectives of the SMMEs and should be guided by the competitive benefit the SMMEs would like to achieve. The manufacturing goals could be one or several performance dimensions. However, the decision-maker should take care that the selected dimensions are not conflicting with each other. For e.g., Integration would be the most appropriate manufacturing goal for SMMEs to address the changing needs of the customer proactively. Accordingly, the SMMEs may also select real-time diagnosis &amp; prognosis as the supporting goal to become highly proactive.The manufacturing goals should be aligned with the overall business objectives of the SMMEs and should be guided by the competitive benefit the SMMEs would like to achieve.

        <p>SMS is different from the traditional manufacturing systems in terms of the way operations are performed, quality is checked, maintenance is performed and employees' relationships are developed; and therefore, requires different measures for performance evaluation. The study had few limitations, which provides opportunities for future research.SMS is different from the traditional manufacturing systems in terms of the way operations are performed, quality is checked, maintenance is performed and employees' relationships are developed; and therefore, requires different measures for performance evaluation.

        <p>Although the study setup is based on the India-based empirical data, India is a unique economy being one of the largest economies in Asia, with a large number of SMMEs, and many diaspora Indian entrepreneurs scattered around Asia and the Globe, there is some potential for generalizability, albeit this is not the main objective of the study. Nonetheless, focus on India creates significant future research opportunities for scholars, and we invite them to test the measures in other economies in and outside Asia.Although the study setup is based on the India-based empirical data, India is a unique economy being one of the largest economies in Asia, with a large number of SMMEs, and many diaspora Indian entrepreneurs scattered around Asia and the Globe, there is some potential for generalizability, albeit this is not the main objective of the study.

        <p>The measures used in this study are statistically validated using data collected from mediumsized auto-component manufacturing organizations based in India. Therefore, it would be necessary to conduct similar studies and confirm the findings in other industries such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals, FMCG, etc. It would also be interesting to find out which performance dimensions are more powerful or more fundamental than others while evaluating SMS.The measures used in this study are statistically validated using data collected from mediumsized auto-component manufacturing organizations based in India.

        <p>The SMS is a change initiative and needs different technologies such as IoT, cloud computing, CPS to be implemented. Therefore, SMS implementations will differ from one organization to the next due to differences in the market being served, technological maturity, competitive and regulatory environment. The previous studies have identified barriers to implementation of SMS and provided solutions to overcome them (Kamble et al., 2018b). However, it is presumed that SMS being a huge transformation process, it is sure to be influenced by the organizational culture, its values, and traditions. The present study has not considered this aspect, requiring future studies to investigate the influence of organizational culture on SMS performance and provide insights on how to measure them for effective implementation of SMS.The SMS is a change initiative and needs different technologies such as IoT, cloud computing, CPS to be implemented.

        <p>The study identified a set of sustainable dimensions, namely, social and ecological, that influence the SMS. However, the extent of influence these measures have on the SMS is dependent on the existing practices of the organizations. The literature reveals that lean and circular economy practices provide a facilitating environment for Industry 4.0 and data-driven supply chains, leading to sustainable organizational performance (Kamble et al., 2019;Belhadi et al., 2020). Therefore, it would be interesting to investigate how the identified performance measure dimensions are used in organizations with different levels of lean and circular economy practices.The study identified a set of sustainable dimensions, namely, social and ecological, that influence the SMS.
