        <p>Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reviews of reporting companies' annual financial reports represent a significant public enforcement activity relating to financial disclosure regulation in the United States. These reviews are conducted by the Division of Corporation Finance at least once every three years for all public issuers in accordance with Section 408 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX, 2002). The purpose of an annual report review is to ensure that the issuer is compliant with generally accepted accounting principles and SEC disclosure regulations. As such, annual report reviews represent a form of government oversight over financial reporting, rather than a traditional enforcement activity, such as that conducted by the Division of Enforcement, which is designed to sanction wrongdoing (Heese, Khan and Ramanna, 2017).Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reviews of reporting companies' annual financial reports represent a significant public enforcement activity relating to financial disclosure regulation in the United States.

        <p>When the SEC examiner finds one or more issues worthy of a request for clarification, change, or additional disclosure, they issue a comment letter requesting a reply within ten days. The issuer replies in writing, and can request an extension where the ten day timeframe is not feasible. These documents, filed on form UPLOAD for SEC comments, and on form CORRESP for company responses, are publicly available on the SEC's EDGAR web site.When the SEC examiner finds one or more issues worthy of a request for clarification, change, or additional disclosure, they issue a comment letter requesting a reply within ten days.

        <p>The purpose of this study is to better understand the nature and impact of comment letters on financial reporting and firms' information environment. It is important to study comment letters because they are one of the primary disclosure compliance mechanisms for the US securities regulator. The SEC devotes considerable resources to conducting the reviews that generate comment letters, and issuers incur significant costs in responding to comment letters. Companies' responses to comment letters can reveal significant shortcomings in financial reporting practices. Managers and auditors may initiate investigations as a result of SEC comments that lead to the discovery of internal control weaknesses and misstatements. Investors should understand the implications of information revealed in comment letters for their estimates of earnings quality and valuation estimates, and there are prominent examples of investors using comment letters as a source of information, in particular short sellers (e.g., Sandler, 2013), who have the most incentive to iden-tify negative information and publicize it (Ljungqvist and Qian, 2016). 2 Comment letters are of interest to management and auditors as the content of comment letters reflects on firms' financial reporting capabilities. If comment letters reveal deficient disclosures or misstated financial statements, then the resulting corrections or restatements will have negative repercussions for both management and auditors (e.g., Hennes, Leone and Miller, 2014). Understanding the potential significance of a comment letter is therefore useful to management to inform the amount of attention and effort to put into a firm's response. Finally, regulators may find insights in this study since it speaks to the effectiveness of this channel of oversight over financial reporting.The purpose of this study is to better understand the nature and impact of comment letters on financial reporting and firms' information environment.

        <p>Several studies use comment letters as a proxy for lower reporting and audit quality (e.g., Gietzmann and Pettinicchio, 2013;Hribar, Kravet and Wilson, 2014), under the expectation that firms with more deficiencies in their financial reports and securities filings are more likely to receive comment letters. The emerging literature examining SEC comment letters illustrates a generally beneficial effect on the information environment of firms that receive them (Johnston and Petacchi, 2017). However, there is a documented lack of an average stock price response to the comment letter disclosure event, implying that comment letters do not present clearly good or bad news, on average (Dechow, Lawrence and Ryans, 2016;Johnston and Petacchi, 2017). This is a somewhat unexpected result, because the issuance of a comment letter is prima facia evidence that SEC reviewers found comment-worthy disclosure issues in an issuer's financial statements. Bozanic, Dietrich and Johnson (2017) shows that comment letters are issued in more than half of reviews in most years, indicating that many comment letters may involve only innocuous comments, or at a minimum that receipt of a comment letter does not, by itself, indicate below-average reporting quality.Several studies use comment letters as a proxy for lower reporting and audit quality (e.g., Gietzmann and Pettinicchio, 2013;Hribar, Kravet and Wilson, 2014), under the expectation that firms with more deficiencies in their financial reports and securities filings are more likely to receive comment letters.

        <p>The initial analysis in this study develops a Naive Bayesian (NB) textual classification of comment letters that are expected to be associated with two specific future financial reporting outcomes: restatements and write-downs. A training set of comment letters is coded as being a restatement comment letters if the recipient firm has a restatement in the year following comment letter disclosure, and a not-restatement comment letter if there is no restatement in the year following comment letter disclosure. The NB classifier creates a statistical model based on the differences between words used in the restatement training documents compared to the nonrestatement training documents. When presented with a new comment letter, the model calculates the likelihood that the letter belongs to the restatement class or the non-restatement class. The training sample begins with 10-K comment letters issued in 2006 and 2007, used to predict the class of comment letters issued in 2008, which become the first year of the testing sample. I(NB Restatement) is set to 1 for testing sample comment letters expected to be associated with future restatements, and 0 otherwise, and the process is repeated each year to create a full testing samples that extends through 2016. The process is repeated a second time to create an NB classification signal for write-downs. The NB write-down signal, I(NB Write-Down), is set to 1 for testing sample comment letters expected to be associated with future write-downs, and 0 otherwise.The initial analysis in this study develops a Naive Bayesian (NB) textual classification of comment letters that are expected to be associated with two specific future financial reporting outcomes: restatements and write-downs.

        <p>The NB classifications are compared to other quantitative metrics that also plausibly idenitfy important comment letters. A common critique of textual analysis applied in the accounting and finance literature is that it can be difficult to replicate, as the model parameters and training data are not available to test in other settings (Loughran and McDonald, 2016). 3 The literature suggests other quantitative signals of comment letter importance. One is the number of letters in a comment letter conversation, which reflects the cost of responding (Cassell, Dreher and Myers, 2013). A comment letter conversation comprises all the comment letters (form UPLOAD) and company responses (form CORRESP) that relate to a single review, and they are identified by being disclosed on EDGAR at the same time and by referring to the same 10-K filing. A second quantitative signal is an indicator for comment letters addressing revenue recognition issues appear to be more material to insiders (Dechow et al., 2016). This study also proposes additional quantitative metrics of comment letter importance. Significantly negative abnormal returns at comment letter disclosure reflects the market's assessment of comment letter information content, and abnormal investor downloads of the comment letters from the SEC's EDGAR web site reflects greater investor attention. This study compares the relative effectiveness of these quantitative classifications with the NB text classifications, to illustrate the relative effectiveness of these measures for predicting future restatements, write-downs, earnings levels, persistence. It is important to understand the relative performance of these indicators, given the greater complexity involved in determining the textual classifications compared to using quantitative measures.The NB classifications are compared to other quantitative metrics that also plausibly idenitfy important comment letters.

        <p>The results indicate that both textual and quantitative classification signals are associated with future restatements, write-downs, and earnings. Different classification signals, both text-based and quantitative, are associated with different outcomes, so there does not appear to be one "best" measure of comment letter importance. Different signals appear to identify information revealed through the SEC review, leading to variation in investor responses and firm outcomes. The finding that comment letters identified by these metrics are predictors of future financial reporting outcomes is consistent with the view that comment letters reveal new information and are associated with managements' future financial reporting choices and real activities, including disclosure changes (e.g., Bozanic et al., 2017;Brown, Tian and Tucker, 2018), fair value estimate credibility (Bens, Cheng and Neamtiu, 2016), and earnings management behavior (Cunningham, Johnson, Johnson and Lisic, 2019).The results indicate that both textual and quantitative classification signals are associated with future restatements, write-downs, and earnings.

        <p>The textual classification signal for restatements is a statistically significant predictor of future restatements, with a univariate increase in predictive power of 60.1 percent over non-signaled comment letters, and a 29.7 percent increase over the sample base rate of restatements in a probit regression that includes other known predictors of restatements as controls. The textual classification signal for write-downs has an increase in predictive power of 25.3 percent over non-signaled comment letters on a univariate basis, and an 11.7 percent increase over the sample base rate after controlling for other known predictors of write-downs.The textual classification signal for restatements is a statistically significant predictor of future restatements, with a univariate increase in predictive power of 60.1 percent over non-signaled comment letters, and a 29.7 percent increase over the sample base rate of restatements in a probit regression that includes other known predictors of restatements as controls.

        <p>Quantitative classifications of comment letters also provide useful measures of comment letter importance. The EDGAR download classification is an effective predictor of both future restatements and write-downs, and is associated with lower levels of future earnings. The negative abnormal returns classification is associated with lower future earnings as well as a higher likelihood of future write-downs. The number of comment letters in a conversation-based classification is associated with lower earnings persistence and future write-downs. Overall, these results indicate that certain comment letters are predictably associated with future financial reporting outcomes, and that different classification measures identify variation in comment letter materiality.Quantitative classifications of comment letters also provide useful measures of comment letter importance.

        <p>This study also documents the nature of, and trends in, comment letter topics classified using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). LDA identifies statistical "topics" through groupings of words that commonly occur together within a set of documents. The resulting statistics can be used to describe a single document by the fraction its words associated with each of the identified topics. Aggregated, these results can describe the distribution of topics across a large set of documents, illustrating how the SEC's focus on particular topics changes over time. The associations between LDA topics assigned to individual comment letter conversation and those letters' textual and quantitative classifications gives evidence for the mechanisms affecting future earnings, the cost of comment letter remediation, and investor attention.This study also documents the nature of, and trends in, comment letter topics classified using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

        <p>Plausible topics are associated with the textual classifications. For example, the NB writedown signal is associated with comment letters that emphasize goodwill impairment, segment reporting, and operating performance topics-all key elements of the impairment testing process.Plausible topics are associated with the textual classifications.

        <p>Topic analysis also provides insights where the associated topics are not intuitively obvious, for example that investor attention measured by EDGAR downloads is associated with comment letters on licensing agreements, non-GAAP issues, and taxes. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that the presence of most topics, by themselves, are not statistically significantly predictors of future restatements and write-downs, although the goodwill impairment topic by itself is a significant predictor of write-downs. In descriptive analysis of topic trends over time, there is considerable variation in the prominence of several topics over the 2006 to 2016 period. For example, there was a significant increase in executive compensation-related comments during the 2008-2010 period, reflecting an SEC priority for enforcing new disclosure regulations.Topic analysis also provides insights where the associated topics are not intuitively obvious, for example that investor attention measured by EDGAR downloads is associated with comment letters on licensing agreements, non-GAAP issues, and taxes.

        <p>In additional analyses, this study tests whether comment letters classified as important by textual and quantitative classification signals are associated with improvements in firms' earnings credibility. Johnston and Petacchi (2017) This study contributes to several areas of literature. First, it contributes to the emerging literature on SEC comment letters and financial reporting quality, which has examined the likelihood of receiving a comment letter and the cost of comment letter remediation (Cassell et al., 2013).In additional analyses, this study tests whether comment letters classified as important by textual and quantitative classification signals are associated with improvements in firms' earnings credibility.

        <p>Other studies examine the relation between comment letters and disclosure changes (e.g., Robinson, Xue and Yu, 2011;Brown et al., 2018;Bens et al., 2016;Bozanic et al., 2017). Although some comment letters appear important as evidenced by increased insider sales around their disclosure (Dechow et al., 2016), Johnston and Petacchi (2017) do not find an average price response to their disclosure. Comment letters have been used as proxies for financial reporting and audit quality (e.g., Ertimur and Nondorf, 2006;Gietzmann and Pettinicchio, 2013;Hribar et al., 2014). Cunningham et al. (2019) finds that comment letters are associated with a reduction in financial earnings management and a substitution towards real earnings management. Johnston and Petacchi (2017) show an overall increase in ERCs following comment letter disclosure. This paper extends the comment letter literature by identifying that specific classifications of comment letters are associated with future financial reporting outcomes: lower earnings, earnings persistence, restatements, and write-downs, and by describing the topics associated with these classifications and outcomes. This study also contributes descriptive analyses by illustrating variation in the distribution of comment letter topics over time and how these topics related to regulatory, market, and disclosure trends. This study further shows that un-important comment letters can be used to identify firms with higher earnings credibility, since less-important comment letters relate to post-disclosure improvements in ERCs.Other studies examine the relation between comment letters and disclosure changes (e.g., Robinson, Xue and Yu, 2011;Brown et al., 2018;Bens et al., 2016;Bozanic et al., 2017).

        <p>More broadly, this paper also contributes to the accounting literature on financial reporting and audit quality (e.g., Kinney, Palmrose and Scholz, 2004;Hribar and Jenkins, 2004;Hennes et al., 2014). Teoh and Wong (1993) builds on Holthausen and Verrecchia (1988) to show that ERCs are increasing in the perceived credibility of the earnings report. Other financial reporting outcomes related to earnings quality include restatements and write-downs (e.g., Kinney and McDaniel, 1989;DeFond and Jiambalvo, 1991;Hribar and Jenkins, 2004;Palmrose, Richardson and Scholz, 2004;Liu, Raghunandan and Rama, 2009;Dechow, Ge, Larson and Sloan, 2011;Francis, 2011;Ramanna and Watts, 2012;Lawrence, Sloan and Sun, 2013;Laurion, Lawrence and Ryans, 2017).More broadly, this paper also contributes to the accounting literature on financial reporting and audit quality (e.g., Kinney, Palmrose and Scholz, 2004;Hribar and Jenkins, 2004;Hennes et al., 2014).

        <p>Second, this study speaks to the effects of public enforcement of securities laws, through the SEC's monitoring role over registrant's annual financial statements. La Porta, Lopez-de Silanes and Shleifer (2006) proposes that public enforcement is relatively unimportant, but that greater disclosure has a positive impact on market development through private enforcement mechanisms. Christensen, Hail and Leuz (2013) finds a positive impact of government accounting enforcement in the IFRS adoption setting. Dyck, Morse and Zingales (2010) show that the SEC is one of a variety of actors that detect and enforce securities laws. Duro, Heese and Ormazabal (2019) conclude that private enforcement is improved with the disclosure of comment letters through the private enforcement channel via institutional shareholdings. Naughton, Rogo, Sunder and Zhang (2018) demonstrate a tradeoff between foreign and domestic public enforcement activities for cross-listed firms using comment letter reviews. The AAER literature is also related as it studies the effect of the SEC's Division of Enforcement (e.g., Feroz, Park and Pastena, 1991;Dechow, Sloan and Sweeney, 1995;Dyck et al., 2010), which is a less frequent but more severe channel of public enforcement compared to comment letter reviews by the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance (Heese et al., 2017). Comment letters are a mechanism by which the SEC encourages greater disclosures by US registrants, and reveals when the securities regulator believes the registrant is out of compliance with accounting or disclosure regulations, when an important comment letter is issued, or is largely compliant, when an innocuous letter is issued. This study's findings that a subset of comment letters are predictably associated with future reporting outcomes and improved earnings credibility provides direct evidence of the impact of the SEC's monitoring activities.Second, this study speaks to the effects of public enforcement of securities laws, through the SEC's monitoring role over registrant's annual financial statements.

        <p>Third, this study contributes to the literature on the use of textual analysis in accounting and finance. Naive Bayesian (NB) classification techniques have been used to classify tone in financial disclosures, analyst reports, and stock message boards (e.g., Antweiler and Frank, 2004;Li, 2010;De Franco, Vasvari, Vyas and Wittenberg-Moerman, 2013;Huang, Zang and Zheng, 2014). This study is applies Naive Bayesian classification to accounting disclosures using a training classification based on actual financial reporting outcomes, rather than based on hand coding of document words or sentences. LDA topic analysis has been applied to describe the evolution of 10-K disclosures (Dyer, Lang and Stice-Lawrence, 2017), and to identify the focus of analyst discussions (Huang, Lehavy, Zang and Zheng, 2018). In this study, LDA topic analysis provides descriptive evidence of the content of comment letters and is used to illustrate the mechanisms by which the different comment letter classifications are related to outcomes, market response, and investor attention.Third, this study contributes to the literature on the use of textual analysis in accounting and finance.

        <p>Caveats apply to this study. NB textual classification and LDA topic analysis are derived from specific collections of texts, and can be difficult to replicate in different settings or with a different set of documents. To mitigate this issue, this study compares the performance of textual classification to more transparent quantitative metrics. The online appendix provides the classification models and examples for how to reproduce the text-based signals used in this study and apply them to new comment letters. As comment letter topics evolve over time, these specific textual classification models will likely exhibit lower power, since the topics and words used in future comment letters will differ from those in the training sample. In order to adapt to these changes, the same NB procedure described herein may be used to re-estimate the classification models using new training documents. Another caveat is that the evidence presented here is not designed to provide a causal interpretation of the effect of comment letters on financial reporting quality: the evidence related to future restatements, write-downs, earnings, and ERC changes, following a comment letter, may indicate either that comment letters causally change financial reporting, or that comment letters simply reveal new information about the existing state of the target firm. The tests presented here do not distinguish between the two interpretations.Caveats apply to this study. NB textual classification and LDA topic analysis are derived from specific collections of texts, and can be difficult to replicate in different settings or with a different set of documents. To mitigate this issue, this study compares the performance of textual classification to more transparent quantitative metrics. The online appendix provides the classification models and examples for how to reproduce the text-based signals used in this study and apply them to new comment letters.

        <p>As a result of the major bankruptcy and fraud cases in the early 2000's, Section 408 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was enacted with a mandate for the SEC to review the annual financial reports of every public issuer at least once every three years, for the protection of investors (SOX, 2002). If a review identifies issues that warrant additional disclosure, correction, or clarification, the SEC issues a comment letter and a written correspondence with the issuer proceeds until the SEC is satisfied that all questions are resolved. Beginning with comments on filings made after August 1, 2004, the SEC began posting all comment letters and the issuer's responses on the EDGAR web site for public dissemination 45 calendar days (20 business days beginning in 2012) after a review's completion. Considerable resources are expended by the SEC and reporting companies and their advisors, including public accounting firms and lawyers, in making and responding to these comment letters: in 2012, the SEC conducted 4,380 reviews, representing 48 percent of all issuers, and wrote 3,566 comment letters referencing annual reports. These reviews represent the significant majority of the Division of Corporation Finance's headcount and $135 million annual budget (SEC, 2015), and presumably the cost of responding borne by reporting companies is several times greater than the SEC's cost of issuing questions.As a result of the major bankruptcy and fraud cases in the early 2000's, Section 408 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was enacted with a mandate for the SEC to review the annual financial reports of every public issuer at least once every three years, for the protection of investors (SOX, 2002).

        <p>Because important comment letters may cause firms to identify previously unrecognized shortcomings, or to release strategically withheld news, the disclosure of important comment letters should be associated with investor attention and stock price responses. Studies of investor attention note that investor demand for news articles is associated with the information content of those articles (e.g., Engelberg and Parsons, 2011). EDGAR downloads are a direct measure of investor demand, and such downloads are associated with information events, and have been shown to be related to the efficiency of earnings news dissemination (Drake, Roulstone and Thornock, 2015). Loughran and McDonald (2017) examines characteristics of the EDGAR log file data, and Ryans (2017) notes that care needs to be taking cleaning the raw EDGAR log file data set to accurately count comment letter downloads, which are usually filed as PDF documents. Drake, Johnson, Roulstone and Thornock (2019) examine the demand for EDGAR filings, and provide evidence that information acquisition, particularly for sophisticated investors, is predictive of future firm performance.Because important comment letters may cause firms to identify previously unrecognized shortcomings, or to release strategically withheld news, the disclosure of important comment letters should be associated with investor attention and stock price responses.

        <p>A second metric reflecting the information content of a comment letter is the market response to the disclosure (Ball and Brown, 1968;Beaver, 1968), although observing a response is a joint test of the information content and investors' attention and their ability to interpret the information (Hirshleifer and Teoh, 2003). Because comment letters reflect deficient disclosures as perceived by the SEC examiners, the expected market response to an important comment letter is negative at the disclosure event. To account for the possibility that limited attention causes a delayed response to the comment letter disclosure, cumulative abnormal returns beginning one day prior to the comment letter disclosure and ending 10 days following disclosure is used.

        <p>Comment letters present a challenge to researchers studying their information content and consequences, because they have an unstructured format and do not present consistent numerical statistics, such as earnings and revenues which are available in standard financial statements. As a result, textual analysis techniques may provide useful inferences about the nature of comment letters and their effect on issuers.Comment letters present a challenge to researchers studying their information content and consequences, because they have an unstructured format and do not present consistent numerical statistics, such as earnings and revenues which are available in standard financial statements.

        <p>Statistical text analysis has been used in accounting and finance research to study the text portion of disclosures, and these techniques developed as a response to the difficulty and cost of hand-coded content analysis, which necessitates small sample sizes (e.g., Bryan, 1997). Loughran and McDonald (2016) survey textual analysis techniques used in the accounting and finance literature. Dictionary based techniques use wordlists with pre-supposed meanings to identify the tone of a text by counting the number or fractions of words belonging to a list (e.g., Tetlock, 2007;Kothari, Li and Short, 2009a;Davis, Piger and Sedor, 2012). Document length or reading difficulty have been used as measures of reporting complexity (e.g., Li, 2008;You and Zhang, 2009;Peterson, 2012), or of management deceptiveness (e.g., Larcker and Zakolyukina, 2012). Feldman, Govindaraj, Livnat and Segal (2010) find significant market reaction to 10-Q and 10-K reports, conditioned on the tone of filings. Law and Mills (2015) find that firms with more negative annual report tone pursue more aggressive tax planning strategies. These studies indicate that textual analysis based on word lists can be effective, despite evidence that commonly used dictionaries can be misleading or ambiguous in the financial setting (Loughran and McDonald, 2011).Statistical text analysis has been used in accounting and finance research to study the text portion of disclosures, and these techniques developed as a response to the difficulty and cost of hand-coded content analysis, which necessitates small sample sizes (e.g., Bryan, 1997).

        <p>Tone and reading-ease measures do not seem particularly applicable in the comment letter setting, since comment letters are primarily technical documents discussing the application of accounting and disclosure standards. Given the nature of the comment letter process, which relates to the enforcement of disclosure regulation, comment letters are often associated with outcomes such as restatements and write-downs, so an intuitive approach is to classify documents according to their relation to these outcomes. While many comment letters request that a registrant restates a financial disclosure during the comment letter conversation, these comment letters are less informative at their release, since the restatement was revealed prior to the disclosure of the related comment letter (Johnston and Petacchi, 2017). Rather, the more interesting comment letters for the purpose of this study are those that can be identified as associated with restatements that occur following the comment letter's disclosure. To investigate the ability of a widely-used statistical text classification technique to identify comment letters associated with future restatements and write-downs, this study implements two Naive Bayesian text classifications specifically targeted on these future outcomes. Documents may be classified according to any arbitrary classification scheme, and the NB classification technique has been widely used in many settings (e.g., Lewis, 1998). The NB classification method uses a set of training documents, which belong to known classes, for example authorship (Shakespeare, not-Shakespeare) or tone (positive, negative), where the class is either known to the researcher by other means or is coded based on the researcher's opinion, to statistically identify the words or multiple-word features in the documents which differentiate it as belonging to a particular class. The classification algorithm identifies all features in the document set, and then calculates the likelihood of each feature appearing in the documents belonging to each class, based on each feature's empirical frequency. When presented with a new document of unknown class, the NB algorithm observes the frequency of each of the features in the new document, and calculates the likelihood that the document belongs to each class, according to Bayes Theorem. The class with the greatest likelihood is the predicted class of the new document.Tone and reading-ease measures do not seem particularly applicable in the comment letter setting, since comment letters are primarily technical documents discussing the application of accounting and disclosure standards.

        <p>NB classification is one of the most established methodologies used to classify text (e.g., Lewis, 1998;Loughran and McDonald, 2016), and has been used in the past to determine document classification based upon authorship (e.g., Mosteller and Wallace, 1984), genre (e.g., Karlgren and Cutting, 1994;Kessler, Numberg and Schutze, 1997), news category (e.g., Feldman and Dagan, 1995;Dagan, Feldman and Hirsh, 1996), and the sentiment of movie reviews (e.g., Pang, Lee and Vaithyanathan, 2002). In the law literature, Talley and O'Kane (2012) identifies the properties of specific clauses within merger agreements. NB classification is used in the accounting and finance literature for classifying the tone of individual sentences in financial disclosures, analyst reports, and stock message boards (e.g., Antweiler and Frank, 2004;Li, 2010;De Franco et al., 2013;Huang et al., 2014). In these studies, the NB classification involves the researcher manually determining the classifications of training documents. This manual coding exercise is a disadvantage because it is costly and difficult to replicate by other researchers, and prior literature notes that it is potentially subject to bias (e.g., Loughran and McDonald, 2016). To prepare the NB analysis, first the complete text is downloaded for all comment letters and company responses relating to sample 10-K comment letters. All letters (forms UPLOAD and CORRESP) in a conversation are concatenated into a single disclosure, consistent with their being disclosed simultaneously. Second, the text was preprocessed according to standard pby converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, numbers, and common english stop words, or frequent words that appear too commonly to be discriminatory such as to, so, and, and is. The remaining words were stemmed, so that derivative words are replaced by their common word stem, e.g., operating and operations become operat. This ensures that similar words are counted as a common feature, and further reduces computational complexity. Third, all consecutive oneand two-word features (i.e., unigrams and bigrams) in the document set selected as the feature set. The use of bigrams preserves some of the ordering of words in the document, for example, it allows the feature income statement to be maintained, rather then being split into two separate features income and statement, resulting in the retention of two-word accounting terms. A matrix where each row represents a specific document and each column represents a feature is created, with each cell in the resulting term document matrix representing the term frequency-inverse document frequency ("tf-idf") statistic for the column's feature in the row's document. The tfidf statistic increases proportionately with the number of times the word appears in the particular document and decreases proportionately for the number of times the word appears throughout all the documents combined. The term document matrix is finally simplified by removing any terms that appear in fewer than 1 percent of the documents and in more than 90 percent of the documents, as very infrequent and very frequent terms have little contribution to the classification, and fewer terms make computations less costly. The final feature set is 1,880 unigrams and bigrams. Further details of the NB classification and its calculation mechanics can be found in numerous prior studies that apply NB classification (e.g., Antweiler and Frank, 2004;Li, 2010;De Franco et al., 2013;Huang et al., 2014). The rolling window design results in all observations, after the minimum first year training sample is reserved, being used in a testing sample, resulting in 7,692 of 8,483 (91 percent) of the 10-K comment letter observations being used in a testing sample. This has the advantage of giving a significantly larger sample size for running analyses than would be available in a typical 50 percent random or time-based sample. The rolling window method also eliminates any look-ahead bias, where future documents train a model that predicts past outcomes. The rolling window approach allows the classifications to evolve over time, so that as the SEC's focus issues evolve, the classifications incorporate resulting changes in comment letter vocabulary. The results are robust to using other sampling approaches, such as a 50/50 percent random training/testing sample pooled across all available years, or a first half training sample, second half testing sample approach.NB classification is one of the most established methodologies used to classify text (e.g., Lewis, 1998;Loughran and McDonald, 2016), and has been used in the past to determine document classification based upon authorship (e.g., Mosteller and Wallace, 1984), genre (e.g., Karlgren and Cutting, 1994;Kessler, Numberg and Schutze, 1997), news category (e.g., Feldman and Dagan, 1995;Dagan, Feldman and Hirsh, 1996), and the sentiment of movie reviews (e.g., Pang, Lee and Vaithyanathan, 2002).

S UE is calculated as in Livnat and Mendenhall (2006), using the difference between IBES actual and consensus earnings per share, and four quarter lagged operating earnings per share if IBES estimates are not available, scaled by share price. The mean market capitalization of firms in the all 10-K sample is $8,366 million, which is larger than the mean Compustat population of $4,773 million (untabulated) over the same period, and is consistent with Cassell et al.

        <p>Topic analysis of comment letters provides both descriptive analysis of the content of this enforcement channel, and helps to illustrate the potential mechanisms behind the NB and quantitative classifications. The NB classification is based upon a "bag-of-words" approach, whereby the word frequency identifies the class of a document. 4 The restatement classification may be an effective predictor of future outcomes, but it provides little interpretable insight into how the content of the particular comment letter relates to the outcomes. This study conducts the LDA topic analysis to be able to describe the content of both a single comment letter, and also to give descriptive evidence regarding variation in topics over time.Topic analysis of comment letters provides both descriptive analysis of the content of this enforcement channel, and helps to illustrate the potential mechanisms behind the NB and quantitative classifications.

        <p>Following a growing body of literature on LDA topic analysis research in accounting and finance (e.g., Bao and Datta, 2014;Dyer et al., 2017;Hoberg and Lewis, 2017;Huang et al., 2018), this study uses LDA to identify a set of topics that are empirically observed in comment letters. The LDA technique, described in detail by Blei, Ng and Jordan (2003), determines the probability that each term in the feature set (e.g., unigrams and bigrams) belongs to a topic, based the rates at which terms co-appear in a set of documents. The algorithm identifies the features and probabilities associated with each topic, as well as statistics about the distribution of topic-words present in each document. Dyer et al. (2017) uses LDA to illustrate how the contents of 10-K reports has developed over time.Following a growing body of literature on LDA topic analysis research in accounting and finance (e.g., Bao and Datta, 2014;Dyer et al., 2017;Hoberg and Lewis, 2017;Huang et al., 2018), this study uses LDA to identify a set of topics that are empirically observed in comment letters.

        <p>This study creates an LDA topic distribution for the entire comment letter sample, using the same document features (unigrams and bigrams) as the NB classification. The main parameter choice is the number of topics. For analyzing comment letters, 20 topics was selected based on manual inspection of the resulting word sets assigned to each topic, after iterating from 5 to 50 topics and observing the resulting word lists associated with each topic. With 20 topics, the resulting term lists revealed distinct but consistent features that could be identified as a group of related financial reporting terms. When fewer than 20 topics are used, the words associated with a single topic clearly discussed different reporting concepts, such as revenues and taxes, indicating that multiple financial reporting topics were combined into one LDA topic. When greater than 20 topics are used, the words associated with several different topics became indistinguishable from each other, for example two or more topics containing revenue-related words. Using 20 topics, the groups of features appear both distinct and non-overlapping.This study creates an LDA topic distribution for the entire comment letter sample, using the same document features (unigrams and bigrams) as the NB classification.

        <p>Table 3 provides descriptive statistics for the relative frequency at which each topic appears in the entire sample. Similar to prior LDA literature, the topic description is given by manually examining the documents which score highest with each topic (following, e.g., Quinn, Monroe, Colaresi, Crespin and Radev, 2010;Bao and Datta, 2014;Huang et al., 2018). In the comment letter setting, top scoring documents often have just one or two questions which could clearly be described by the description given in the Topic Description column.Table 3 provides descriptive statistics for the relative frequency at which each topic appears in the entire sample.

        <p>The value in the Mean Column of Table 3 describes the average fraction of words in all comment letters assigned to each topic. These descriptives illustrate that the largest amount of comment letter text is devoted to standardized language-the opening and closing paragraphs-with Topic 19, at 12.3 percent, and Topic 18, at 9.0 percent of all comment letter text. After the standardized language, questions on operating performance (Topic 6, 8.0 percent), compensation factors (Topic 10, 7.5 percent), revenue recognition (Topic 4, 5.5 percent), and internal controls (Topic 13, 5.5 percent) appear to be most prominent.The value in the Mean Column of Table 3 describes the average fraction of words in all comment letters assigned to each topic.

        <p>The LDA topic analysis appears to be effective at describing the contents of the comment letters, as can be seen from inspecting a sample document. For the empirical tests using LDA topics, it is useful to create dummy variables for a comment letter to indicate the presence of a topic. The LDA algorithm provides continuous topic allocation measures and so each letter has at least some small probability of including every topic. In order to code the significant topics present in a comment letter, this study uses indicator variables for each comment letter conversation, equal to one when the comment letter's topic weighting is in the top quartile of all comment letters for that topic. Table 3 enumerates the 75 percentile threshold, illustrating, for example, that a comment letter requires 6.8 percent of its words to These trends appear to be grounded in economic and regulatory events. Goodwill impairment comments (Topic 2), were elevated during the stock market decline of 2009, when firms were more likely to be trading below book value, a condition which appears to prompt the SEC to question the carrying value of goodwill and companies' impairment testing procedures. Executive compensation comments (Topic 10) increased significantly from 2008 to 2010, peaking in the range of 15 to 20 percent of all comment letter words during this period. This is consistent with a broad lack of compliance with new and revised compensation rules that came into effect beginning November 7, 2006. In fact, the SEC launched a targeted review of filings related to compensation disclosures, completed in September 2007. This targeted review identified consistent areas of weakness, such as failure to disclosure performance targets. 5 . In follow up to these identified areas of disclosure non-compliance, the SEC appears to have included compensation issues in a large fraction of annual reviews for all filers during the subsequent three-year review cycle.The LDA topic analysis appears to be effective at describing the contents of the comment letters, as can be seen from inspecting a sample document.

        <p>In reviews, the SEC frequently urges managers to provide additional disclosures, and such requests may require managers to reveal strategically withheld information as well as identify firms with inadequate financial reporting practices. Responding to comment letters may also cause managers and auditors to uncover information or revise their assumptions for subsequent reporting periods, including possible restatements and write-downs.In reviews, the SEC frequently urges managers to provide additional disclosures, and such requests may require managers to reveal strategically withheld information as well as identify firms with inadequate financial reporting practices.

        <p>If the comment letter process either reveals that a firm had no significant disclosure deficiencies, or if the comments resulted in disclosure improvements without proprietary cost effects, then earnings should not be affected by the review process, and the market response and investors' perceptions of earnings credibility could be positive, consistent with prior literature regarding disclosure quality and performance (e.g., Lang and Lundholm, 1993;Francis, LaFond, Olsson and Schipper, 2005;Francis, Nanda and Olsson, 2008).If the comment letter process either reveals that a firm had no significant disclosure deficiencies, or if the comments resulted in disclosure improvements without proprietary cost effects, then earnings should not be affected by the review process, and the market response and investors' perceptions of earnings credibility could be positive, consistent with prior literature regarding disclosure quality and performance (e.g., Lang and Lundholm, 1993;Francis, LaFond, Olsson and Schipper, 2005;Francis, Nanda and Olsson, 2008).</p>
        <p>However, when managers avoid disclosing proprietary information or bad news, and such undisclosed information is not reflected in market prices (e.g., Dye, 1985;Jung and Kwon, 1988;Bloomfield, 2002), then efforts by the SEC to improve disclosures through the review process could reveal new information in response letters and subsequent periodic filings. Johnston and Petacchi (2017) consider the effects of restatements that occur during the review process, which can preempt the informativeness of the comment letter disclosure itself, since the remedy is already publicly known. But there may be additional information provided in the comment letter correspondence, and the effects of the review may carry on into subsequent periods, with additional disclosures of unfavorable information, resulting in negative returns and a lower market perception of earnings credibility (e.g. Kothari, Shu and Wysocki, 2009b).However, when managers avoid disclosing proprietary information or bad news, and such undisclosed information is not reflected in market prices (e.g., Dye, 1985;Jung and Kwon, 1988;Bloomfield, 2002), then efforts by the SEC to improve disclosures through the review process could reveal new information in response letters and subsequent periodic filings.

        <p>Restatements have been shown to be important for auditors as well as managers, since restatements may lead to the dismissal of an audit firm (Hennes et al., 2014). Restatements reflect lower financial reporting quality and affect stock returns (e.g., Hribar and Jenkins, 2004;Kinney et al., 2004;Palmrose et al., 2004;Liu et al., 2009;Dechow et al., 2011;Francis, 2011). Auditors are often copied in the comment letter correspondence (Laurion et al., 2017), and the auditor may subsequently modify their assessment of audit risk, increasing scrutiny of areas of financial reporting weakness raised by the SEC.

The most costly topics appear to be topics relating to executive compensation, segment reporting, goodwill impairment, and non-GAAP reporting issues, whereas the least costly comment letters appear related to standardized language, an intuitively obvious result.</p>
        <p>The association between topics and the NB restatement classification is detailed in Column 5 of Table 8, and the analysis indicates that tax, insurance, and goodwill impairment topics are most associated with the restatement signal. For the NB write-down classification, described in Column 6, the most significantly associated topics are goodwill impairment, tax, and executive compensation. While the goodwill impairment result is expected as the topic is closely aligned with write-downs, the tax and executive compensation links are not as obvious. Robinson et al. (2011) examine the relationship between comment letters on executive compensation disclosure deficiencies, and find that such issues are related to excess compensation, but do not consider other future reporting outcomes such as write-downs.The association between topics and the NB restatement classification is detailed in Column 5 of Table 8, and the analysis indicates that tax, insurance, and goodwill impairment topics are most associated with the restatement signal.

        <p>Table 9 performs a probit regression analysis of the LDA topics directly on future restatements and write-downs to determine if the presence of these topics are themselves a sufficient signal for identifying important comment letters.

        <p>In Column 1, the marginal effect of the loan loss topic (T1), for example, is significant at the p &lt; 0.1 level, with a marginal effect of 1.4 percentage points, on a base rate of 7.7 percent, which appears material. However, given that there are 20 independent variables of interest, a variable that achieves significance at the p &lt; 0.05 or p &lt; 0.1 level may be spurious. Held to this standard, none of the topics are highly significant predictors of future restatements. This may reflect either a lack of statistical power or the fact that comments on particular topics vary in their severity, and so additional quantitative or language cues are needed to identify important comment letters.In Column 1, the marginal effect of the loan loss topic (T1), for example, is significant at the p &lt; 0.1 level, with a marginal effect of 1.4 percentage points, on a base rate of 7.7 percent, which appears material.

        <p>In Column 2, the goodwill impairment topic (T2) is a significant predictor of future writedowns (p &lt; 0.01), with a marginal effect of 4.9 percent on a base rate of 23.7 percent. This result indicates that questions on this topic alone appear sufficiently powerful to be associated with higher rates of future write-downs. None of the other topics achieve a coefficient different from zero with a high level of statistical significance.In Column 2, the goodwill impairment topic (T2) is a significant predictor of future writedowns (p &lt; 0.01), with a marginal effect of 4.9 percent on a base rate of 23.7 percent.

        <p>Overall, this results indicate that different topics are clearly associated with the market, attention and reporting outcome based signals of future outcomes. The association between the LDA goodwill impairment topic and future write-downs is intuitive, but most other LDA topics are not otherwise sufficient to predict financial reporting outcomes directly. Some significant associations are less obvious and potentially interesting avenues for further investigation, for example an association between executive compensation-related letters and future write-downs (Dechow, Huson and Sloan, 1994).Overall, this results indicate that different topics are clearly associated with the market, attention and reporting outcome based signals of future outcomes.

        <p>Johnston and Petacchi (2017) find that comment letters, on average, improve firms' information environment through increases in earnings credibility, measured by ERCs, following comment letter disclosure. This gives rise to two interpretations: First, comment letters could causally affect a firm's reporting quality through channels such as modified accounting estimates or audit intensity, resulting in changes to earnings quality. Second, the comment letters could simply reveal information about the underlying financial reporting quality of the firm, without having a causal effect.Johnston and Petacchi (2017) find that comment letters, on average, improve firms' information environment through increases in earnings credibility, measured by ERCs, following comment letter disclosure.

        <p>POST is an indicator variable equal to 1 for quarterly earnings announcements after the comment letter disclosure, and 0 prior to the comment letter disclosure.

A positive coefficient on β 3 is consistent with higher market response to earnings surprises, following comment letter disclosure. The regression includes all control variables interacted with SUE, firm and year fixed effects.

The main result of Johnston and Petacchi (2017) is replicated in Column 1, with a positive and significant coefficient on SUE * POST (coef. = 0.146, p &lt; 0.05), indicating that ERCs are higher following comment letter disclosure, suggesting improved earnings credibility as a result of the comment letter process.Table 10 presents the results of this analysis.

        <p>There is little evidence that the important comment letters are related to improvements in ERCs.

        <p>These results provide an interesting perspective on the mechanisms by which comment letters affect earnings credibility.

        <p>The SEC comment letter process reveals valuable information about the financial reporting quality of public issuers with implications for future financial reporting outcomes and earnings credibility. Classifying comment letters based on quantitative measures (i.e., EDGAR downloads, announcement returns, revenue recognition comments, number of letters) and textual analysis (i.e., Naive Bayesian classifications for future restatements and write-downs) provides significant predictive power for future financial reporting outcomes such as future restatements, write-downs, and earnings.The SEC comment letter process reveals valuable information about the financial reporting quality of public issuers with implications for future financial reporting outcomes and earnings credibility.

        <p>While the textual classification signals are effective predictors of the specific outcomes for which they are developed, future restatements and write-downs, they are not particularly broad signals of comment letter importance, as they do not predict each other's outcomes, and do not have a statistically significant association with earnings or earnings persistence. The EDGAR download based signal of importance, which may be easier to calculate than a text based measure, appears to be a useful metric for predicting both future restatements and write-downs, Improvements in earnings credibility following comment letters, measured using changes in ERCs, is mostly dominated by comment letters classified as not important, except for the negative announcement return signal, which does indicate letters associated with ERC improvements. This provides evidence that it is generally the innocuous comment letters that are associated with the market's subsequent perception of higher earnings credibility.While the textual classification signals are effective predictors of the specific outcomes for which they are developed, future restatements and write-downs, they are not particularly broad signals of comment letter importance, as they do not predict each other's outcomes, and do not have a statistically significant association with earnings or earnings persistence.

        <p>Topics discussed in comment letters show variation over time, and reflect the priorities of the SEC for enforcing new rules and regulations, and changes in issuer reporting behavior. The topics discussed in the comment letters have plausible relationships to the signals of importance, and the goodwill impairment topic's by itself is predictive of future write-downs. The relationships between comment letter topics and investor attention and future financial reporting outcomes may suggest topics that appear important to investors but have not yet been explored in the literature.Topics discussed in comment letters show variation over time, and reflect the priorities of the SEC for enforcing new rules and regulations, and changes in issuer reporting behavior.
