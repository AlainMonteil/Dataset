        <p>Strategic alliances require mutual trust and collaboration between organizations. To increase alliance performance, organizations in a strategic alliance are more likely to interpret each other's equivocal behaviors in a positive way to sustain the stability of the relationship. Different from traditional mechanisms to build interorganizational trust, blockchain facilitates trust among alliance partners via its technology advantages, for example, public ledger and distributed consensus. The decentralized and distributed nature of a blockchainbased system assures that no single organization can add information to the chain without an approval from the alliance, nor can it make unilateral changes in the system. Drawing from the Affordance Theory, we propose an exploratory research design to understand the structure of a blockchain-based system, as well as how this blockchain-based system influences interorganizational trust in a strategic alliance and how blockchain-enabled interorganizational trust influences alliance performance. The case studies of two eastern banks indicate that the technical features of blockchain can help reduce equivocal behaviors and improve interorganizational trust. We discuss the findings and conclude the paper with implications.Strategic alliances require mutual trust and collaboration between organizations.

        <p>Trust in interorganizational relationships is one of the most troubling challenges faced by organizational managers in strategic alliances. Strategic alliance is an agreement between two or more parties to undertake a mutually beneficial project or pursue a set of objectives while each retains its independence (Mowery et al., 1996). This requires mutual dependence and collaboration (McEvily and Marcus, 2005). In other words, partners in strategic alliances have to deal with environmental uncertainty as well as the uncertainty arising from each other's behavior. Interorganizational trust is defined as "the expectation held by one firm that another will not exploit its vulnerabilities when faced with the opportunity to do [so]" (Krishnan et al., 2006, p.895), and is one of the most important issues in smoothening the function of strategic alliances (Dyer &amp; Chu, 2003). It helps defuse conflict between organizations (Zaheer et al., 1998) and increase alliance performance, as trustworthy partners are more likely to interpret each other's equivocal behaviors in a positive way to sustain the stability of the relationship, while distrustful partners find it difficult to commit and contribute to the relationship. Previous studies have investigated various mechanisms that facilitate trust because of the importance of trust in alliances. Whether in strategy or trust literature, proposed methods to build interorganizational trust generally point to somewhat generic issues, such as selecting partners with high level of similarity (Robson et al., 2008), building distributive fairness (Argyres et al., 2007), and controlling alliance size (Hitt et al., 2000).Trust in interorganizational relationships is one of the most troubling challenges faced by organizational managers in strategic alliances.

        <p>Increasing recognition that the power of information technology, particularly emerging technologies such as blockchain, could be harnessed to address issues on building interorganizational trust in strategic alliances. Blockchain revolutionizes the traditional ways of dealing with trust issues in different industries (Völter et al., 2021;Zhao et al., 2016), such as finance (Kumar et al., 2021), energy (Utz et al., 2022), healthcare and open government (Bore et al., 2019;Roth et al., 2022). Blockchain is distributed throughout the parties in a network, requiring the validation of new records of transactions or digital events before being added to the chain (Denter et al., 2022;Wang et al., 2016). The security mechanism of blockchain is based on public ledger and distributed consensus. In other words, the decentralized and distributed nature of a blockchain-based system ensures that no single party can approve additions to the chain, nor can it make unilateral changes in the system (Craggs &amp; Rashid, 2019;Schlatt et al., 2022). Therefore, compared to classically centralized systems that rely on manual monitoring and control to assure interorganizational trust, a blockchain-based system is better at preventing malicious activities, such as fraud and hacking (Sarker et al., 2021;Xu, 2016), and supporting trustworthy transactions via networked computation (Völter et al., 2021;Zhao et al., 2016).Increasing recognition that the power of information technology, particularly emerging technologies such as blockchain, could be harnessed to address issues on building interorganizational trust in strategic alliances.

        <p>Blockchain has been touted as a trust machine due to its great implications in building trust and revolutionizing business (The Economist, 2015), a key issue in understanding how blockchain facilitates interoganizational trust remains unanswered. This gap limits organizations' capability to derive beneficial business impacts from blockchain implementations. Therefore, organizations should not necessarily conclude that they can derive business values by building trust with partners from implementing blockchain before the gap is fulfilled. An increasing number of studies have examined this emerging technology in recent years (Liu et al., 2020;Young et al., 2020;Queiroz et al., 2019). However, we found that research on blockchain predominately adopts a technology-determinism perspective and focuses on examining the technical designs of blockchain (e.g., Utz et al., 2022;Tan et al., 2020;Li et al., 2020), while ignoring business impacts. Current research has also suggested that there are more studies conceptualizing the benefits and challenges of blockchain applications than those investigating the real impacts of blockchain (Frizzo-Barker et al., 2020). It is still sparse to see academic attention on the interplay of blockchain technology, its technical characteristics, and its business impacts, such as building interorganizational trust in strategic alliances. Therefore, to address this lacuna, we explore the following:Blockchain has been touted as a trust machine due to its great implications in building trust and revolutionizing business (The Economist, 2015), a key issue in understanding how blockchain facilitates interoganizational trust remains unanswered.

(RQ2)."What technical features of blockchain have made it a trustworthy technology?" (RQ1), "How does a blockchain-based system afford interorganizational trust among partners in a strategic alliance?" (RQ2).</p>
        <p>To answer these research questions and unpack the black box in blockchain implementation, we draw upon on affordance theory. Affordance is defined as "the possibilities for goal-oriented action afforded to specific user groups by technical objects" (Markus &amp; Silver, 2008, p.622). The affordances of technology are action possibilities permitted by the technical features of technology (c.f., Gibson, 1979). In order to fully capture the role of technology in practice, it is useful to abstract these technical features to a set of more general affordances that the technology provides. Through this theoretical lens, we have identified the above four key technical properties of blockchain based systems, and affordances emerge at the intersection between IT artifacts and actors. We engaged in an in-depth investigation of two revelatory cases that successfully implemented blockchain technology in the business of asset-backed securities (ABS) in the finance sector, the Oriental Bank (pseudonym) and the Northern Bank (pseudonym) through the perspective of affordance theory (Markus &amp; Silver, 2008) and contribute to the literature by highlighting the importance of understanding how technical features of blockchain technology afford inter-organizations' collaboration in strategic alliances at both data and process levels. In addition, we reveal that interorganizational trust based on competency and integrity is shaped by both data affordance and process affordance.To answer these research questions and unpack the black box in blockchain implementation, we draw upon on affordance theory.

        <p>This study aims to make several theoretical and empirical contributions. Firstly, it extends affordance theory by differentiating affordance on data level and process level and extends the applicability of affordance theory to blockchain. Second, while previous studies have focused primarily on the technical aspects of blockchain, our research attempts to identify the affordance of blockchain in the asset financial context and seeks to offer a sociotechnical understanding of how organizations in strategic alliances could benefit from the implementation of blockchain. This is in line with recent calls for the socio-material axis of cohesion in information systems (IS) -related research (Sarker et al., 2019). Third, our study contributes to the literature on IS success by deriving key success factors that fit the specifics of blockchain and differ from prior findings. Practically, our study can help practitioners effectively implement blockchain and extract value by eliminating frictions and facilitating interorganizational trust in long-term collaborations.This study aims to make several theoretical and empirical contributions.

        <p>Blockchain is touted as the most promising technologies in the Fin-Tech revolution (The Economist, 2015). Although it was firstly developed to serve as distributed ledgers tracking bitcoin transactions, blockchain's potential extends beyond bitcoin, and is regarded to change many activities in business world (Zhang et al., 2021;Du et al., 2019). Basically, a blockchain is a chain of data blocks created to record transactions safely by using time stamp, including four components, viz., distributed ledger, consensus mechanism, and encryption mechanism, and smart contract, as defined below in Table 1 (CAICT Blockchain Whitepaper Report, 2018). Based on the four components of blockchain as an IT artifact, it affords transactions and has the potential to change the business.Blockchain is touted as the most promising technologies in the Fin-Tech revolution (The Economist, 2015).

        <p>As illustrated in Table 1, with the technical features of distributed ledger, consensus, encryption, and smart contract, blockchain provides advantages, such as decentralization (Hassania et al., 2018), persistency (Viriyasitavat &amp; Hoonsopon, 2018), privacy (Zhang et al., 2021), immutability (Ziolkowski et al., 2020) and contractability (Cong et al., 2019). Leveraging these advantages, transactional uncertainties and risks could be prevented across organizations and industries. Therefore, blockchain has great potential to create value in several industries (Liang et al., 2021).As illustrated in Table 1, with the technical features of distributed ledger, consensus, encryption, and smart contract, blockchain provides advantages, such as decentralization (Hassania et al., 2018), persistency (Viriyasitavat &amp; Hoonsopon, 2018), privacy (Zhang et al., 2021), immutability (Ziolkowski et al., 2020) and contractability (Cong et al., 2019).

        <p>In the finance industry, blockchain is positioned as a digital innovation and an emergent enabling technology. For financial service providers, a huge concern is the increased level of regulation and the lack of competitiveness. Financial business process, such as credit business and supply chain finance, usually requires strategic coordination across upstream and downstream organizations and across departments within a particular organization to provide flexible financial products and service, which may be the result of inequality and information asymmetry. Consequently, blockchain with above-mentioned architectural properties is continuously being employed by financial organizations to assist in reducing time and labor costs (Hassania et al.,In the finance industry, blockchain is positioned as a digital innovation and an emergent enabling technology.

        <p>Driven by the demands to solve practical issues from the industry, it is not surprising that research on the technical aspects of blockchain is gaining attention (Cong et al., 2019). In reviewing the relevant literature on the topic, we found a large number of previous studies are technically oriented work (Sarker et al., 2021;Laurie et al., 2020;Li et al., 2020), focusing on the domain-specific application of blockchain (e.g., Khan et al., 2021;Viriyasitavat et al., 2019;Hassania et al., 2018). Typically, the identification and resolution of technical challenges are the concerns encountered during the implementation of blockchain in a specific financial project. For example, Zhang et al. (2021) proposed an innovative blockchain-based technical model by utilizing cryptographical methods including "zero-knowledge proof" to solve the difficulty in data auditing and data encryption for insurance companies. Securities features, issues, technologies, and approaches in blockchain-embedded Internet of Things are important aspects of blockchain in computational communication system (Xu et al., 2021). Algorithmic improvement can optimize the efficiency of blockchain architecture (Behnke et al., 2020). Blockchain-based sensor data protection system can be built to leverage data science approach to prevent data fraud (Chanson et al., 2019). To summarize, this stream of research has successfully dealt with limited aspects of blockchain by featuring few blockchain applications in a specific context, while consequently the scalability of research design and generalizability of findings has remained underexplored.Driven by the demands to solve practical issues from the industry, it is not surprising that research on the technical aspects of blockchain is gaining attention (Cong et al., 2019).

        <p>Compared to the scientific advancement achieved in specific technical issues involved in blockchain implementation, there is much less progress in recognizing the social and practical implications of blockchain (Du et al., 2019). Exception focuses on the adoption and choice of blockchain (Liang et al., 2021). Current research in the information systems (IS) discipline calls for more attentions on examining the business benefits of blockchain to organizations beyond its technical structures (Zhang et al., 2021;Laurie et al., 2020). As remarked by Kohli and Liang (2021), to obtain a full advantage of this new technology, a single research perspective in technical aspect is far from enough. Due to the importance in taking a sociotechnical perspective in IS research (Cecez-Kecmanovic et al., 2014), it is necessary to integrate blockchain into existing strategic infrastructure of organizations. Therefore, our study responds to this call by investigating how blockchain technologies in two banks are implemented to realize business impacts. As affordance was adopted as the theoretical lens in this study, we illustrate affordances of blockchain to build interorganizational trust. By doing so, we synthesize the technical and business aspects of blockchain in two real banking cases, which helps to obtain the sociotechnical perspective.Compared to the scientific advancement achieved in specific technical issues involved in blockchain implementation, there is much less progress in recognizing the social and practical implications of blockchain (Du et al., 2019).

        <p>There is considerable support from researchers and practitioners that trust is central to enduring, productive relational exchanges (Argyres et al., 2007). Interorganizational trust emphasizes the collectively held trust orientation by members of one organization toward another organization (McEvily and Marcus 2005). In essence, interorganizational trust entails the willingness of a venturing organization' management to accept vulnerabilities based on positive expectations about the counterparts' motives, intentions, and behaviors (e.g., Colquitt et al., 2007).There is considerable support from researchers and practitioners that trust is central to enduring, productive relational exchanges (Argyres et al., 2007).

        <p>Due to the complexity of this concept, extant literature conceptualizes interorganizational trust from different perspectives (Rousseau, Sitkin et al., 1998;Zaheer and Venkatraman, 1995). For example, Williamson (1993) takes a calculative view on understanding interorganizational trust. As a bilateral economic activity, building trust is the way the firm achieves its economic goals. Thus, firms tend to calculate the benefits and costs of trusting actions, such as a specific asset investment. Different from research using the calculative perspective, another stream of research adopting a more affective view. Firms develop trust because of reciprocated care, value similarity, and identification (McAllister, 1995), which further reduces perceived risks. Give the different perspective examining trust, research indicates two separate dimensions of trust arising from the competence (i.e., technical skills, experience, and expert knowledge) and integrity of trustee (i.e., motives, honesty, and character) (Connelly et al., 2012), which are conceptualized as competence-based trust and integrity-based trust respectively.Due to the complexity of this concept, extant literature conceptualizes interorganizational trust from different perspectives (Rousseau, Sitkin et al., 1998;Zaheer and Venkatraman, 1995).

        <p>Competence-based trust is an expectation that a partner has required technical skills, experience, and reliability to fulfill specified obligations (Lui &amp; Ngo, 2004). In this dimension, trust in an organization is driven by expectations of technically proficient performance, specific technical skills, and perceived reliable performance over time (Lee, 2004;Whipple &amp; Frankel, 2000). The competence-based dimension is consistent with the calculative view adopting by Williamson (1993), focusing on the instrumental and rational motives that drive organizational behaviors. It is assumed that organizations make rational, efficient choices to maximize expected gains. Therefore, an organization will only be perceived as trustworthy if there are adequate rational grounds for believing that the organization is competent and reliable (Hardin, 1992).Competence-based trust is an expectation that a partner has required technical skills, experience, and reliability to fulfill specified obligations (Lui &amp; Ngo, 2004).

        <p>The integrity-based dimension of trust is driven by perceptions of an organization's motives, honesty, and character (Kramer, 2006). It emphasizes the social and attitudinal underpinnings of trust. Organizations in strategic alliance evaluates alignment of values and motives with partners. The difference in values and motives would undermine confidence and perceived integrity-based trust. Therefore, integrity-based trust is defined as the trustor's perception that the trustee adheres to a set of principles that the trustor finds acceptable (Connelly et al., 2018). Following this definition, an organization is perceived to have integrity-based trust when it honors previously established agreements by acting in accordance with them.The integrity-based dimension of trust is driven by perceptions of an organization's motives, honesty, and character (Kramer, 2006). It emphasizes the social and attitudinal underpinnings of trust. Organizations in strategic alliance evaluates alignment of values and motives with partners. The difference in values and motives would undermine confidence and perceived integrity-based trust. Therefore, integrity-based trust is defined as the trustor's perception that the trustee adheres to a set of principles that the trustor finds acceptable (Connelly et al., 2018). Following this definition, an organization is perceived to have integrity-based trust when it honors previously established agreements by acting in accordance with them.</p>
        <p>As competence-and integrity-based trust are two separate constructs investigated in the literature, it is noted that they may be developed and nurtured by respective and unique mechanisms (Kim et al., 2004). Specifically, a lack of integrity-based trust does not necessarily mean that an organization will deem its partner to be untrustworthy in terms of competence (Ferrin et al., 2007), and vice versa. Thus, it is informative to consider the relative facilitators, especially under the context of implementing blockchain technology.As competence-and integrity-based trust are two separate constructs investigated in the literature, it is noted that they may be developed and nurtured by respective and unique mechanisms (Kim et al., 2004).

        <p>The concept of affordances originates from the field of ecological psychology, which describes the features that environments provide animals (Gibson, 1986). Recent research more specifically describes affordances as "relations between the abilities of organisms and features of the environment" (Chemero, 2003, p.189), indicating the idea that the features of an environment may afford certain actions to some actors, but not others. Therefore, affordances are not properties of environments that exist independent of actors. Instead, it is the relation between the environment and the actors. An object can only afford something when an actor capable of using the features to interact with the object .The concept of affordances originates from the field of ecological psychology, which describes the features that environments provide animals (Gibson, 1986).

        <p>By importing the idea of affordance from ecological psychology to IS research at organizational level, it does not only deal with individual goals, but also the goals of a group or inter-connected organizations, and the coordinated actions of groups of people (Volkoff &amp; Strong, 2013). It has been adapted to depict the possibility of some action of which an actor is sensing (Treem &amp; Leonardi 2012) or to indicate the easy discoverability of possible actions (Majchrzak et al., 2013). Affordance of IT artifacts arises from the relation between an IT artifact and goal-directed actors. If the technological affordance is perceived and evaluated, then IT users will "take actions that may satisfy certain needs", which is termed as actualization (Trocin et al., 2021;Du et al., 2019). Markus and Silver (2008) extend the idea of affordances of an environment to technical objects and define functional affordances as "the possibilities for goal-oriented action afforded to specified user groups by technical objects" (Markus &amp; Silver, 2008 p. 622), which is the focus of this study on blockchain. Taking up the perspective of affordance, IS scholars have investigated understanding the affordance of technology to be actualized in various contexts, such as e-healthcare (Li et al., 2020) and artificial intelligence (Trocin et al., 2021).By importing the idea of affordance from ecological psychology to IS research at organizational level, it does not only deal with individual goals, but also the goals of a group or inter-connected organizations, and the coordinated actions of groups of people (Volkoff &amp; Strong, 2013).

        <p>Specific to our study, the idea of affordance is a useful lens to explain the effects of technologies on organizations, particularly why the implementation of particular IT artifacts can produce various outcomes with different actors (c.f., Markus &amp; Silver, 2008). Taking these various definitions and descriptions together, this paper defines functional affordances of blockchain technology as the possibilities for goal-oriented action that are afforded by blockchain to participating organizations given their capabilities and goals. As our research questions exploring the affordances of blockchain technology actualized in building interorganizational trust in a strategic alliance, we take affordances as theoretical lens to explore the reciprocal interaction between blockchain technology and organizations. As an emerging technology, blockchain has been given little attention both theoretically and empirically in terms of examining its affordances. As a result, whether and how the above-mentioned sub-dimensions of IT affordances can be adapted to the research of blockchain technology remains unexplored. In the following section, we investigate these questions via the case studies of two banks in China.Specific to our study, the idea of affordance is a useful lens to explain the effects of technologies on organizations, particularly why the implementation of particular IT artifacts can produce various outcomes with different actors (c.f., Markus &amp; Silver, 2008).

        <p>We aim to explore the impact of a blockchain-based system on interorganizational trust and alliance performance in a strategic alliance in financial sector. A case study approach deems to be appropriate for the exploratory nature of this study (Eisenhardt, 1989). We benefit from the contextual richness and authenticity of case research to understand and validate the new phenomenon of interest (Yin, 2003). We follow Klein and Myers' (1999) principles of interpretative case studies to design our research method. We chose a multisite field research of two cases to investigate the nature and impact of blockchain technology on interorganizational trust. We looked for a context where organizations have developed and implemented blockchain technology for the same type of financial business. The organizations should be comparable in terms of the type, size and other characteristics significant in this context. Moreover, we need unrestricted access to various stakeholders of the case companies. These criteria have led us to identify two state-owned banks located in different cities of China, both of which have developed and implemented the blockchain-based system with its business partners to deal with business on asset-backed securities (ABS).We aim to explore the impact of a blockchain-based system on interorganizational trust and alliance performance in a strategic alliance in financial sector.

        <p>As indicated in Fig. 1, the ABS business is self-organized in a decentralized structure, which highly requires on close collaboration among a bunch of stakeholders. In addition, due to a large number of underlying assets from diversified obligators packaged in each security, valid and secure information sharing is especially important. The director in charge of credit business was the advocate of fintech. He knew that for long his team had suffered from high cost in manual verification and coordination between dozens of stakeholders in traditional ABS business without fintech support. To address this issue, he started to consider and prepare the implementation of blockchain. He contacted with the top management advocating the idea of adopting blockchain in ABS business. His idea was agreed by the head office, and the blockchain-based ABS system has been officially launched in Oriental Bank since the end of 2018.As indicated in Fig. 1, the ABS business is self-organized in a decentralized structure, which highly requires on close collaboration among a bunch of stakeholders.

Similar to the Oriental Bank, the Northern Bank realized the importance of fintech to increase sustainability, and the head office was ambitious in being leader in banking industry by harnessing fintech. In 2018, a subsidy targeted at fintech was established and blockchain in ABS business was the first project launched. The reason of choosing ABS out of other financial businesses was similar to the Oriental Bank. That is, the decision to implement blockchain in ABS business was driven mainly by the needs of eliminating manual verification and data fraud in traditional business process. Due to the great attention on blockchain, the decision was made from the top-down, and thus the designing and implementation process were highly efficient. By the middle of 2019, the new blockchain-based ABS system was launched and the nodes were deployed in organizations collaborating with the Northern bank.

        <p>Both Oriental Bank and Northern Bank developed the blockchainbased system based on the infrastructure of Fabric 1.0 from Hyperledger in ABS business context. That means these two blockchain-based systems were similar in terms of infrastructure, functionality of applications, and node deployment. Generally speaking, the blockchainbased ABS system developed by the two banks enables distributed data storage and data sharing between the banks and their organizational partners. Four main organizational partners have participated in the blockchains in total, including collateral providers, custodian banks, loan servicers, such as law firms, accounting firms, rating agencies, and securities firms. Each party is considered as one node in the blockchain (as indicated in Fig. 2). The ABS system includes two main functions, i. e., ABS data management and ABS business process management. ABS data such as data on cash flow and data on asset package, are shared between the bank and its partners in the distributed database. The cryptographic mechanism embedded within the blockchain assures all data stored in the system is anonymous and irreversible. Therefore, it is impossible to compromise the integrity of records in the ABS system, which consequently prevents financial fraud. The module on ABS business process management enables each node in the blockchain to manage a series of processes, such as screening assets, packaging assets, designing product, issuing and transferring securities, and managing cash flow.Both Oriental Bank and Northern Bank developed the blockchainbased system based on the infrastructure of Fabric 1.0 from Hyperledger in ABS business context.

Additional data in forms of meeting recordings, and informal conversations were also collected and examined. This rich set of secondary data allowed us to complement interview data containing recollections of the ABS system use with observations unfolding in front of us. We also participated in forums on Blockchain and Fintech in 2020 and 2021 to exchange views with representatives from other banks implementing blockchain technology, experts in designing blockchain technologies, and government representatives.Business staff in these two banks and their partners constituted the main designers and end users of the ABS system, covering the representatives from different ABS project groups.

        <p>We describe our data analysis in two parts. First, we bear in mind that the specific guiding interview questions based on the overarching research questions in this study. In order to examine and identify the "underlying coherence" (Taylor, 1976 p.153) through our interpretation of the data and the answers to the questions, we juxtaposed tentative explanations for the focal sites, in preparation for further "abstraction" of tentative concepts that might explain overall empowerment enabled by blockchain technology. The integrated analysis allowed us to derive concepts that were closely related to the context of each site. We borrow from grounded theory methodology (Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967) as an inductive technique to ground the impact of blockchain technology in empirical data (Bhattacherjee, 2012), which is therefore is a well-suited guideline for case study research (Yin, 2003). We coded the transcript interviews to single out text segments that relate to the technical features of blockchain technology, affordance of blockchain technology, and interorganizational trust, as well as their linkages. The perspective of hermeneutics was used to analyze data to explore the answers to our research questions. Then, we developed inferential codes that link these codes together as indicated in our research framework (e.g., structure of the blockchain-based ABS system) (Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994). Through inferential coding, we condensed the effects of blockchain technology in influencing interorganizational trust and alliance performance.We describe our data analysis in two parts.

        <p>As we proceeded, each cycle of the abstraction and visitation of the empirical data improved the clarity of explanations as a better understanding of the data. The cycle was reiterated until all the tentative explanations were accounted for, and a temporal internal agreement was achieved. Theory was developed in this inductive reasoning process. We have zoomed into the data related to technical features and affordance of blockchain technology, to examine which part of technical features and affordance result in interorganizational trust.As we proceeded, each cycle of the abstraction and visitation of the empirical data improved the clarity of explanations as a better understanding of the data.

        <p>With the emergence of our findings, we consistently ensured the alignment between data, theory, and findings (Klein and Myers, 1999) until the findings were finalized. To ensure the convergence of interpretations by interviewees, the rule of triangulation was applied: multiple data sources (interviews, focus groups, and archival data) were used to filter "false preconceptions" of interviewees and researchers; this ensured consistency of data. Our analysis indicated that as an integrated technology, blockchain technology could be classified into four fundamental technical features, viz., cryptography, distributed ledger, consensus, and smart contract. Moreover, we suggest the presence of technical features and functional affordances. Using the summary table as the primary corpus of data, we proceeded to identify the critical factors of the success of blockchain technology in enhancing interorganizational trust in these banks. By doing so, we derive tentative concepts that could provide an encompassing explanation to affordances of blockchain technology in building interorganizational trust in financial industry, as outlined in the coding schemes and examples in Appendix C.With the emergence of our findings, we consistently ensured the alignment between data, theory, and findings (Klein and Myers, 1999) until the findings were finalized.

        <p>To zoom out and describe the relationship between technical features, data affordance, process affordance, and emerging interorganizational trust, we adapted the process model from Beaudry and Pinsonneault (2010) (Fig. 3) and the sequences of events observable in our data. In order to do so, we analyzed the situations of implementing blockchain technology holistically (per individual interviewees) and then across individuals to identify (1) technical features of the blockchain technology; (2) the data affordance; (3) the process affordance; (4) the interorganizational trust. The linkages among technical features of blockchain technology, data and process affordance, and interorganizational trust (and the supporting evidence) are also conceptualized detailed in our findings.To zoom out and describe the relationship between technical features, data affordance, process affordance, and emerging interorganizational trust, we adapted the process model from Beaudry and Pinsonneault (2010) (Fig. 3) and the sequences of events observable in our data.

        <p>The technical layer was implemented by leveraging the blockchain infrastructure of fabric 1.0 from Hyperledger. Hyperledger is a permissioned blockchain that is widely used to record data and access historical data.

        <p>Cryptography is a fundamental property of blockchain technology. As the two banks and their partners implemented consortium blockchain, 1 that allows data to be shared between predefined and authenticated codes in the chain, key cryptography was implemented and cryptographic validation of transactions was conducted only between these codes. The challenge of a consortium blockchain is to ensure that the system is open to all authenticated nodes in the chain, while guaranteeing the privacy and security of data entry, which is especially important in the financial context. Therefore, in the ABS system of the Oriental Bank, when a new transaction must be added to the chain, it can be programmed to be automatically validated and triggered via the implementation of cryptographic algorithms. The cryptographic algorithms adopted by the ABS system include the hash algorithm, signature algorithm, and certificate of privacy protection. 1 Generally speaking, there are three types of blockchain in terms of control authority of nodes in chain, including public blockchain, private blockchain, and consortium blockchain. As illustrated in our findings, nodes in consortium chain are selected and predefined by specific rules, and thus are able to conduct transactions following consensus. In private blockchain, the authority of reading and writing is strictly controlled and may only belong to a single node. In public blockchain, all nodes have the freedom to participate in the chain or quit. They are able to read and write, and to participate in the process of consensus, which is a perfect example of decentralization. Bitcoin is a successful model of public blockchain.Cryptography is a fundamental property of blockchain technology.

        <p>"As a financial alliance, it is important to keep balance between security, expansibility, and efficiency. Therefore, we chose consortium blockchain over public and private blockchain. The cryptographical algorithms in our system are designed to combine the frames in public and consortium chains. For example, we used the Algorand algorithm 2 to select and authorize few nodes from a large number of nodes, and then we used the PBFT algorithm to build consensus between the nodes" (algorithm engineer A, the Oriental Bank)."As a financial alliance, it is important to keep balance between security, expansibility, and efficiency.

        <p>An important structural property of blockchain-based systems is the ledger, which is used for the collection of transactional data, generation of data blocks, and validity verification of local data. The distributed and decentralized ledger enables data to be added in chronological order and creates chains of data blocks from one node to the next with the goal of creating permanent and tamper-proof records. Therefore, all records in the chain are date and time stamped, ensuring a built-in audit trail for all transactions. Consequently, the data stored are consequently not controlled by any single node in the chain, thereby eliminating the role of the central code or endorsement of a third party. The distributed ledger is important in the design of ABS systems because it eliminates the traditional middlemen associated with most value transactions in the traditional ABS business, and thus enables decentralization.An important structural property of blockchain-based systems is the ledger, which is used for the collection of transactional data, generation of data blocks, and validity verification of local data.

        <p>There are two types of methods to record data in a distributed ledger: a ledger based on assets and a ledger based on accounts. The banks have chosen ledgers based on their accounts to record data. Compared to ledgers based on assets, ledgers based on accounts allows users to conveniently record and search information relevant to each account. As indicated by the IT manager of Oriental Bank, "We implemented the distributed ledger developed by Fabric, which allows us to record and modify data based on account. The key difference between ledger based on account and ledger based on asset is user authorization of each account. In ledger based on account, users are allowed to visit, upload, and manage appropriate data within their authorized power. Through the function of authorization in ledger, data management in each account is recorded, and thus cannot be denied" (IT manager, the Oriental Bank)There are two types of methods to record data in a distributed ledger: a ledger based on assets and a ledger based on accounts.

        <p>The consensus mechanism in blockchain-based systems ensures data consistency across a network of nodes. Coordinated by the consensus mechanism, data are synchronized in the ledger of all nodes, and thus data is recorded in an incorruptible, irreversible manner. The consensus mechanism confirms that transactions are coded into blocks according to cryptographic rules. Specifically, it enables the voting of codes to ensure the integrity of data in the blockchain. In addition, nodes can communicate with each other in the chain via the broadcast of a peer-topeer (P2P) topology before consensus is achieved. Once the new transactions are validated by every node, they are added as a new block to the chain. As indicated by the ABS system designer, "Because our business process requires the involvement of our partners, thus there are several organizations joined the blockchain. We adopted consensus mechanism to ensure decentralization, data consistency and data synchronization. It is just like several organizations working together at the same time, and the working process is within the scope of a stipulated agreement among the organizations" (algorithm engineer B, the Oriental Bank).The consensus mechanism in blockchain-based systems ensures data consistency across a network of nodes.

        <p>"The consensus is the agreement among participants. It is designed based on the business logic and business requirement of ABS context. Each node on the blockchain could only read and write data based on consensus mechanism" (IT manager, the Northern Bank)"The consensus is the agreement among participants.

        <p>A smart contract is added as an important property of an ABS system. Smart contracts are computer programs that can autonomously verify and execute terms of contracts. It is an autonomous, self-sufficient, and decentralized agreement controlled by programming codes that execute business processes automatically under certain conditions (Swan, 2015). Thus, blockchain can allow the self-enforcement of contracts. All various promises in the contract can be authenticated, validating that each node can perform the tasks it is responsible for. For example, according to the smart contract implemented in the ABS system, the Oriental Bank can automatically transfer data to law and account firms once the work is complete.A smart contract is added as an important property of an ABS system.

We provided professional comments in writing a smart contract to eliminate legal risks embedded in the transfer of financial assets between our partners.

        <p>Based on the infrastructure of blockchain, banks and its partners built a blockchain-based network, where each participant was deployed as a node in the network. Transaction proposals were submitted and transactions were validated. Peers executed order-validate transactions automatically through blockchain architecture instead of following traditional process of manual validation which limits scalability and operation reliability. In our cases of both Oriental Bank and Northern Bank, only the specified endorsing peers validate the transactions and transactions were appended to the distributed ledger. For example, collateral providers could upload and propagate information on load and cashflow on the blockchain to prevent further manipulation, while security and rating companies could identify and verify the information before being inscribed on the chain.Based on the infrastructure of blockchain, banks and its partners built a blockchain-based network, where each participant was deployed as a node in the network.

        <p>According to the results of the data analysis, the blockchain technology investigated in this case benefited the two banks and their partners by affording a change in ABS business at both the data and process levels. Moreover, the afforded change in business processes relied on changes in data storage and management, which could not be combined. It is difficult to understand the benefits of blockchain technology in the ABS business process without understanding the afforded change in data. As the affordance of technology refers to the action possibilities of actors, the actors in this case acted at both the data and process levels. Therefore, two different layers of affordances of blockchain were identified at the two banks: affordance at the data level and affordance at the process level, as explained below.According to the results of the data analysis, the blockchain technology investigated in this case benefited the two banks and their partners by affording a change in ABS business at both the data and process levels.

The cryptography function in the blockchain offers advantages for data encryption and decryption, such as privacy protection and security, by protecting confidential information from untrusted platforms and parties, which is especially important in the context of financial business.

This leads us to choose blockchain out of a bunch of fintech. Blockchain allows data encoding and decoding (director of ABS business, the Northern Bank)." 4.2.1.2. Data consistency. Data consistency refers to the result that each user in the system sees a consistent view of the data, including visible changes made by the user's own transactions and transactions of other users. First, because of the decentralized ledger of the blockchain, data are available across a distributed network of peer-to-peer nodes (e.g., Koonce, 2016;Nowinski &amp; Kozma, 2017). This includes activities and transactions dispersed across space and time. A blockchain-based ABS system enables the disclosure of information, and thus increases each node's knowledge of the original dataset. This enables users to trace an indelible record of a product's precise history, such as the original profile and transactions of the asset. Second, the distributed ledger and consensus in blockchain ensure that any data written into the database are valid according to all defined rules, including constraints, cascades, triggers, and any combination thereof. Any node in the blockchain changes affect the data only in the allowed ways. These technical mechanisms enable data consistency across distributed peer-to-peer networks of blockchain nodes (Siba &amp; Prakash, 2016)."Information security is the most important concern in finance.

        <p>"When I collaborated with the banks, the lawyers, and the accounting firms, they want [ed] to know all profile information about my underlying assets. So I have to keep them updated…. On blockchain, I don't have to contact partners one by one every time when I update information. Once the data is uploaded, it is automatically available to everyone" (broker collaborating with the Oriental Bank). 4.2.1.3. Data authenticity. Data authenticity refers to the provability of data that it has not been corrupted after its creation. That means digital data to be authentic must be only the outcome of an acquisition process of a real-world scene without any successively processing, while any processing means corruption (Li et al., 2020). In other words, authentic data must accordingly represent a real-world scene. Even if some processing has been probably applied the meaning of the scene must not be modified. Data authenticity also means that a digital object is indeed what it claims to be or what it has been claimed to be. The cryptography, ledger and consensus of blockchain technology disable the manipulation of data and promises immutability of data. The mechanisms also enable the tracking of chains of data and transactions over time, which ensure data repudiation, as pointed out by the interviewees."When I collaborated with the banks, the lawyers, and the accounting firms, they want [ed] to know all profile information about my underlying assets.

        <p>The process traceability refers to the ability to track the history of asset transactions and information. Because blockchain enhances data transparency and availability among parties, it enables parties to trace all transaction histories. In the blockchainbased ABS system, transactions are attached with an indelible record of precise history, from the original profiles of the transaction to assets sold or consumed by its end customers. The disclosure of information will increase the ability of parties to trace every historical activity for each trail, which makes audit trails much more available and also strengthens the overall ability of parties to control the whole process and its activities. When everything is stored in the memory of the database and can be retrieved by all actors on the chain at any time, the knowledge of past events can no longer be distorted and obliterated. Past transactions and activities are irrefutable, traceable, and supervised, which eliminates the possibility of corruption and fraud. As noted by the manager of an accounting firm, "We don't have to go to the site and do due diligence anymore, which is time-consuming. All original information is available on the blockchain, and we can easily trace the whole process of information transferring from the collateral providers, to the issuers and contractors" (officer B, the accounting firm collaborating with the Oriental Bank).The process traceability refers to the ability to track the history of asset transactions and information.

        <p>Blockchain affords different parties on the blockchain the potential to automate transactions. The ABS process can be classified into three subprocesses: packaging underlying assets, designing and distributing products, and managing post-investment, as shown in Fig. 5 for the traditional system of issuing securities.Blockchain affords different parties on the blockchain the potential to automate transactions. The ABS process can be classified into three subprocesses: packaging underlying assets, designing and distributing products, and managing post-investment, as shown in Fig. 5 for the traditional system of issuing securities.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, an ABS transaction could take weeks or even months to process because it involves the clearance of many paper-based records. In the process of packaging underlying assets, the biggest issue is ensuring the authenticity of asset information, considering the huge amount of information shared in papers between different parties. Data disclosure is a major concern when sharing data. Therefore, a large amount of human and material resources are required to verify data and reconcile conflicts. After information is collected and verified, the assets are screened manually. The product design process is complicated because of the large number of parties involved and the challenges in data verification and analysis. Most importantly, risk management is especially difficult because of the intransparency of informationsharing. Hence, securities buyers have to make decisions based on the reputation of originators and personal trust from prior experiences, as noted below.Traditionally, an ABS transaction could take weeks or even months to process because it involves the clearance of many paper-based records.

        <p>In the past process of asset distribution and post-investment management during the ABS process, information was not transparently shared between different parties, such as originators, plan administrators, and investors. It took time to negotiate and coordinate during the product issuing process. Financial risks were especially difficult to eliminate and control because of the difficulty in obtaining timely and accurate information manually. The products could be subject to a low degree of liquidity and low price stability owing to the high risks involved.In the past process of asset distribution and post-investment management during the ABS process, information was not transparently shared between different parties, such as originators, plan administrators, and investors.

        <p>After adopting the blockchain-based ABS systems, as shown in Fig. 6, parties were allowed to access consistent and indelible records, and as a result, the business process was automated by eliminating manual verification. Certain business processes were executed automatically via smart contracts. For example, in the process of designing products, information on loans, obligators, repayment plans, asset packages, stratified securities, and appendices were uploaded to the blockchain. Credit and rating agencies could verify the information of asset packages inscribed on blockchain, which avoided wasting time on information collection and communication back and forth between organizations. Risk auditing and credit ratings were automatically generated before manual confirmation by deploying a self-executing program using smart contracts. When products were issued and distributed, transactional documents could also be generated automatically, which made it easier for regulators, such as accounting and law firms, to exercise diligence in monitoring transactions. Reports on due diligence could be generated based on verified transactional information on blockchain, which largely simplified and accelerated the entire process. Risk indicators could be set in advance by deploying smart contracts and automatically monitoring the risks. Cash flow, pressure on cash flow, and hierarchical structure models were tested automatically via smart contracts. A comprehensive analysis of assets and liabilities was performed simultaneously. Information on underlying assets could also be accessed by all nodes on the blockchain, which helped in subscribing to products and maintenance, setting product prices, and issuing products. In addition, concerns regarding privacy and data security were perfectly addressed because of the cryptography mechanism in the blockchain. In the process of pro-investment management, statistical analysis of the assets package was automatically generated, and post-investment was monitored simultaneously.After adopting the blockchain-based ABS systems, as shown in Fig. 6, parties were allowed to access consistent and indelible records, and as a result, the business process was automated by eliminating manual verification.

        <p>According to McKnight (2005), trust increases if the characteristics of the other person or parities are considered beneficial for the performance of a task. Competence-based trust is defined as "group of skills, competencies, and characteristics that enable a party to have influence within some specific domain" (Mayer, Davis, &amp; Schoorman, 1995, p.717). In the context of blockchain technology, the favorable characteristics of blockchain for the performance of transactional tasks, that is, affordance at the data and process levels, can influence trust among parties in the chain. Therefore, competence-based trust in interorganizational partners is built on trust in the competence of the blockchain. The probability of blockchain failure is lower as long as the data are shared, and all consortium participants verify the business process. The characteristics of blockchain technology prevent subsequent changes in data and allow process traceability owing to the design of the technology. In previous IS literature (e.g., Nicolaou and McKnight, 2006), data consistency and authenticity are included in the concept of information quality, and a positive relationship between trust and (perceived) information quality has been demonstrated.According to McKnight (2005), trust increases if the characteristics of the other person or parities are considered beneficial for the performance of a task.

        <p>Specifically, based on blockchain, the ABS system can guarantee comprehensive protection against subsequent or malicious alteration of records according to inherent technical features, such as distributed ledger, consensus, and smart contract. Therefore, in the ABS context, because each partner is designed as a node in the blockchain coordinated by consensus mechanisms and smart contracts, we are confident that no modification and errors are permitted, which further increases the trustworthiness of partners in skills and competence to carry out transactions and fulfill obligations. Additionally, owing to its technical properties, blockchain is considered a suitable technology for traceability systems. This helps reduce the perceived uncertainty and risks. Trust in the competence of partners to fulfil obligations is consequently generated and guaranteed due to the elimination of perceived uncertainty by tracing all transactions.Specifically, based on blockchain, the ABS system can guarantee comprehensive protection against subsequent or malicious alteration of records according to inherent technical features, such as distributed ledger, consensus, and smart contract.

        <p>"I totally trust my partners in the chain as I am sure all data they shared are not manipulated. I can also check the historical records of the underlying assets from the originator of the assets at any time I want. The blockchain technology enhances the reliability of transactions in the ABS business" (the manager of business department B, the Oriental Bank)."I totally trust my partners in the chain as I am sure all data they shared are not manipulated.

        <p>Integrity-based trust involves evaluation from trustors of the values and motives of trustees by comparing these values and motives to a set of principles or standards. Integrity-based trust is managed by blockchain based on the provision of tamper-proof data that enables verification of the integrity of reliable information pertaining to each transaction. In these cases, because blockchain assures data immutability on a technical basis, an increasing degree of identifiability and traceability reduces the violation of records. Every node in the chain knows that their actions can be traced back. Thus, the identifiability and traceability of the blockchain process facilitates the responsibility and honesty of organizations to adhere to the principles agreed upon by all participants. When organizations have to perform identifiable actions, they only perform actions for which they are willing to assume responsibility. Accordingly, if all actions are identifiable, organizations do not violate principles and agreements, such as changing any unauthorized information, as they could be held responsible for the violating actions. Therefore, because blockchain requires identity identification and process traceability, parties on the chain have no intent or motive to alter information without authorization. This results in trust in the integrity of each party, as organizations are sure that all nodes in the chain will adhere to the agreed principles and keep the promises they make.Integrity-based trust involves evaluation from trustors of the values and motives of trustees by comparing these values and motives to a set of principles or standards.

        <p>In addition, due to the unique technical feature embedded in the blockchain, it was regarded as a tool symbolizing associations and interpretations in addition to functional utilities, including associations of organizations' values of being righteous and honest. Organizations who intended to engage in illegal and immoral behaviors, such as data leakage and data fraud, would be reluctant to implement blockchain considering the large amount of costs in implementation. Therefore, the implementation of blockchain also builds interorganizational trust via heuristic-image building. The adoption of blockchain could be considered as a signal showing the values and motives of organizations. It showed the willingness and confidence of the organizations to obey set of principles or standards predefined or approved among parties in the network. Organizations consider the adoption of blockchain as a reputation-building mechanism to increase the trustworthiness in integrity as commented in below, "Personally, I trust organizations who implementing blockchain more. That's also the reason why we are proactive in the implementation of blockchain, considering the large amount of investment and efforts in the implementation process.

        <p>Blockchain is an emerging technology that has introduced serious disruptions to traditional business processes. The inherent technical properties of the blockchain architecture allow transparency, robustness, auditability, and security (Warkentin and Orgeron, 2020;Pan et al., 2020). It can be considered a distributed database that contains an ordered list of various records, and these records are connected through immutable chains (Hughes et al., 2019). In principle, it is a distributed data structure with timestamped data that allows verified interactions among members without a trusted authority. It is touted to ensure transactions via a peer-to-peer communication network, which helps stakeholders in the network ensure that various goals are fulfilled Table 4 A Summary of Recent Studies on Blockchain. (Tonnissen &amp; Teuteberg, 2020).Blockchain is an emerging technology that has introduced serious disruptions to traditional business processes.

        <p>Owing to the importance of this technology, blockchains have attracted attention in both practice and academia. Several studies have been conducted in this regard. Before presenting discussions on our research findings, we carefully review literature on the relevant topics, especially literature published in top-tier IS journals, such as the International Journal of Information Management, to ensure that the research findings contribute to existing conversations. Table 4 summarizes studies on blockchain published in the International Journal of Information Management over the past four years.Owing to the importance of this technology, blockchains have attracted attention in both practice and academia.

        <p>Based on these studies, we obtained three main findings. First, we found that blockchain has received considerable attention in the last few years, and the examined research context covers several areas. The majority of papers focused on blockchain in contexts related to supply chains (43%), finance (17%), public administration, and governance (11%). Studies that focused on the supply chain often discuss the functionality of blockchain in ensuring traceability among different stakeholders in a collaborative process. Research that focused on finance discusses the latest applications of blockchain, such as cryptocurrencies. Research on public administration and governance has focused on the opportunities and challenges of integrating blockchain into various governance issues. Notably, as the finance sector is one of the main contexts of applying blockchain technologies, it has received much less attention than the supply chain. Few studies investigating the impact of blockchain technology on organizational performance have focused on a specific application, such as cryptocurrencies (Pineiro-Chousa et al., 2021;Salcedo &amp; Gupta, 2021), and general blockchain-based financial applications are largely ignored in this context.Based on these studies, we obtained three main findings.

        <p>Second, following Frizzo-Barker et al. ( 2020), we classified these studies as conceptual (42%) and empirical (50%) to investigate the current state of conversation in blockchain-related research. Although there are more empirical studies than conceptual ones, the latter is the second most popular research type. Conceptual studies discussed the benefits and challenges of blockchain applications, such as security (Schlatt et al., 2022) and governance (Warkentin &amp; Orgeron, 2020) and developed a theoretical framework for future research. Empirical studies analyzed observable and measurable blockchain-related practices by collecting primary and secondary data. Case studies (31%) were one of the most commonly adopted methods in empirical studies to investigate current applications of blockchain. In addition, as blockchain is an emerging technology, several studies adopted the method of design science (11%) to design blockchain applications to match specific demands in different contexts.Second, following Frizzo-Barker et al.

        <p>Third, previous studies mainly focused on three topics: blockchain adoption (34%), blockchain impact (28%), and blockchain design (11%). To eliminate barriers to the implementation of blockchain in practice, the greatest number of studies examined factors leading to successful blockchain adoption, including technological, organizational, and environmental factors (Janssen et al., 2020;Wong et al., 2020). Surprisingly, the business impact of blockchain in different business areas has not received sufficient attention in current studies compared with topics on blockchain adoption. This may be because the development of blockchain is still at an early stage. Successful blockchain implementations are rare. Therefore, studies have largely adopted an exploratory perspective and investigated the key factors influencing the successful implementation of blockchain. The potential impact of blockchain on extensive business areas, such as finance and banking, requires further examination.Third, previous studies mainly focused on three topics: blockchain adoption (34%), blockchain impact (28%), and blockchain design (11%).

        <p>Based on the summary of previous studies, this study investigates a research question that has been fully answered in current conversations, that is, how do blockchain-based ABS systems in the finance sector impact interorganizational performance? Specifically, we investigate the driving role of blockchain in facilitating trust among partners in a strategic alliance.Based on the summary of previous studies, this study investigates a research question that has been fully answered in current conversations, that is, how do blockchain-based ABS systems in the finance sector impact interorganizational performance?

        <p>To summarize the key findings, we propose a high-level conceptual model in Fig. 7 to explain how organizations in strategic alliances interact with blockchain-based systems. Specifically, we argue that the technical features of a blockchain-based system, including cryptography, distributed ledger, consensus, and smart contract, afford interorganizational collaboration in strategic alliances at both the data and process levels. Interorganizational trust based on competency and integrity is shaped by both data and process affordance. Further, we explain the propositions established in this conceptual framework.To summarize the key findings, we propose a high-level conceptual model in Fig. 7 to explain how organizations in strategic alliances interact with blockchain-based systems.

        <p>The cases of Oriental Bank and Northern Bank indicate that the confluence of different technical features of blockchain technology afford organizations' collaboration in strategic alliances at the data level. Cryptography implemented in the blockchain-based system enables data encryption and decryption. It also promises data authenticity and allows tracking of chains of data and transactions across time and location. The distributed ledger updates the data and ensures consistency across the entire distributed network of all peer-to-peer nodes because of the synchronized decentralized blockchain network. When potential errors occur and are corrected, the data are automatically updated across every node in the network, thereby ensuring data consistency. The consensus mechanism in the blockchain ensures that any data written in the database must be valid according to all defined rules, including constraints, cascades, and triggers. Therefore, programming errors resulting in the violation of any defined database constraints are eliminated, which guarantees data authenticity and consistency. Hence, because of the technical properties of blockchain-based systems, organizational collaboration is afforded at the data level.The cases of Oriental Bank and Northern Bank indicate that the confluence of different technical features of blockchain technology afford organizations' collaboration in strategic alliances at the data level.

        <p>Our case materials for the Oriental Bank and Northern Bank indicate that the blockchain-based system also affords organizational collaboration at the process level. Without blockchain-based systems, organizations involved in the ABS business in the past largely depended on experience and personal trust built through prior experiences to execute transactions. Information was exchanged through paperwork, which was difficult to retrieve. The blockchain-based system serves as an enabler of visibility, traceability, and automation of business processes. For example, cryptography allows data to be visible between authorized parties for all transactions in the whole chain. This significantly increases organizations' ability to trace business processes, both upstream and downstream. The fragmented, disorderly, and scattered information can be easily organized and managed. Therefore, in addition to process visibility, blockchain-based systems can also be considered as a technology to trace processes and obtain timely, accurate, and complete information among business partners in a strategic alliance. Owing to process visibility and traceability, the blockchain system enables engaged parties to replace paperwork with automatic business processes to reduce costs. Information on the process of packaging underlying assets, designing and distributing products, and managing postinvestment assets could be verified and screened automatically. Processes such as the analysis of assets and liabilities are conducted automatically through smart contracts. Hence, we propose: Proposition 2.

        <p>Trust has long been understood as the core of all theories of interorganizational relationships (Williamson, 1993). It involves a set of beliefs and expectations that another organization's actions will be beneficial to each other with long-term orientation and self-interest. The development of trust relies on interpersonal characteristics, such as experience or propensity, or third parties, such as institutional mechanisms (Ou et al., 2014). Because of the technical affordance of blockchain as a pseudonymous peer-to-peer based network, blockchain has become an emergent mechanism of trust-building among consortium members. Given the data and process affordance of blockchain-based systems, personal-based trust is no longer the focus of interorganizational trust in technology-enabled transactions. Interpersonal trust between staff in different organizations has transformed into interorganizational trust based on technology. In the ABS system, once transactional data such as credit conditions and cash flow of loan applicants in underlying assets have been uploaded to the blockchain, it is simultaneously known to stakeholders, including plan administrators and service firms. Therefore, the authenticity and consistency of the data can guarantee that no modification and errors are permitted in the ABS system. The visibility, traceability, and automation of the process enable each node in the network to trace and supervise the entire transaction process, from the release of loans to the trading of asset packages. In addition, smart contracts automate the execution of the transaction process as previously approved by all nodes. Therefore, the data and process affordance of blockchain-based systems facilitate the development of interorganizational trust by enabling participating organizations to handle data and processes based on existing rules and principles. The blockchain activities are shared and verified by all consortium participants. Consequently, the data, processes, and transactions are trustworthy, with significantly reduced perceived uncertainty and risk in transactions. Thus, competence-based trust in interorganizational partners is built based on centralized trust in the ability of blockchain to reduce transactional uncertainties. Hence, we propose: Proposition 3. The data and process affordance of blockchain-based systems play an important role in the development of competence-based interorganizational trust in strategic alliance.Trust has long been understood as the core of all theories of interorganizational relationships (Williamson, 1993).

        <p>The integrity-based dimension of trust focuses on the value and motives of the partners. It includes the perception that the trustee has a strong sense of justice, and their behaviors are highly predictable and congruent with the agreement made by both parties (Cheng et al., 2016). Owing to the data and process affordance of blockchain, illegal and immoral behaviors, such as financial fraud and information leakage that widely existed in traditional ABS business in the past, can be eliminated by the technical mechanisms of blockchain. Our cases indicate that organizations in a blockchain-based business network are required to follow commonly agreed rules and share the value and motives against subversive and violating behaviors in the same blockchain consortium. In addition, the implementation of blockchain has become a mechanism for building heuristic images, which indicates an organization's commitment to being reliable and trustworthy. Integrity-based trust is managed by blockchain based on the provision of tamper-proof data that enables reliable verification of information integrity pertaining to each transaction. The integrity of cryptographically authenticated data builds associated peer trust from the beginning to the end of information collection, propagation, and communication between participating organizations. Hence, perceived and subjective trustworthiness of integrity among participating organizations is transferred to the technology-based and objective trustworthiness of each other's integrity in carrying out ABS transactions without opportunistic behaviors. Therefore, we propose: Proposition 4. The data and process affordance of blockchain-based systems play an important role in the development of integrity-based interorganizational trust in strategic alliance.The integrity-based dimension of trust focuses on the value and motives of the partners.

        <p>By deriving a conceptual model for organizations implementing blockchain from empirical data, this study contributes to the literature on three fronts. First, we extend affordance theory by contextualizing its board and abstract concepts into the context of emerging technology, such as blockchain. By doing so, we conceptualize the data and process affordance of the blockchain. The cases described in this research demonstrate what affordance blockchain-enabled systems can achieve and how systems can achieve affordances via technical features. This study fills the gap in the affordance-related literature via the theorization and conceptualization of blockchain processes and benefits.By deriving a conceptual model for organizations implementing blockchain from empirical data, this study contributes to the literature on three fronts.

        <p>More specifically, our study extends the literature on affordance by conceptualizing the affordance of blockchain in the ABS business at both the data and process levels. The original affordance theory considers affordance as an umbrella concept and emphasizes the possibilities of actions afforded by IT artifacts in various contexts (Markus &amp; Silver, 2008). Thus, this study extends generic technology afforded in the specific context of blockchain. The affordance of IT artifacts varies across technologies and actors, which are highly context specific. While the affordance of technology has been investigated in specific contexts, such as enterprise social media (Davison &amp; Ou, 2017;Jung &amp; Lyytinen, 2014), investigation of the affordance of blockchain is still rare. Considering the surge in blockchain technology, the potential value of affordance theory can be further extended in this research domain. Our study contributes to related research by separating the affordance of blockchain at the data and process levels in a financial context.More specifically, our study extends the literature on affordance by conceptualizing the affordance of blockchain in the ABS business at both the data and process levels. The original affordance theory considers affordance as an umbrella concept and emphasizes the possibilities of actions afforded by IT artifacts in various contexts (Markus &amp; Silver, 2008). Thus, this study extends generic technology afforded in the specific context of blockchain. The affordance of IT artifacts varies across technologies and actors, which are highly context specific.

        <p>Second, in response to the call for sociomateriality in IS (Cecez--Kecmanovic et al., 2014), our study contributes to the literature on blockchain by offering insights into how organizations in strategic alliances benefit from the implementation of blockchain. Even though it is undeniable that blockchain, as an emerging fintech technology, holds the promise of democratizing access to data for stakeholders (Chen &amp; Chen, 2020), knowledge gaps still exist with respect to how organizations would benefit from this technology to build interorganizational trust. Findings from this study thus aid in advancing knowledge by conceptualizing a process model to link the technology structure of blockchain, the affordance of blockchain on data and process levels, and interorganizational trust.Second, in response to the call for sociomateriality in IS (Cecez--Kecmanovic et al., 2014), our study contributes to the literature on blockchain by offering insights into how organizations in strategic alliances benefit from the implementation of blockchain.

        <p>Third, our study contributes to the literature on IT success (Zhang et al., 2017;Cheng et al., 2016) by deriving the key factors for successful implementation of blockchain. Blockchain is an emerging technology that has only a few successful implementations. It is crucial for organizations to fully understand the technical features and affordance of blockchain in a specific context before harnessing technology. Our study demonstrates the potential to inform future research on integrating blockchain into interorganizational practices, especially in the financial context. Furthermore, our study contributes to the theory of applied blockchain among several organizations in a strategic alliance to eliminate frictions, facilitate interorganizational trust, and obtain long-term cooperation and sustainability, rather than implementing it in a single organization. Hence, this exploratory study is timely and highly relevant for scrutinizing the emergent phenomenon of blockchain.Third, our study contributes to the literature on IT success (Zhang et al., 2017;Cheng et al., 2016) by deriving the key factors for successful implementation of blockchain.

        <p>Our study has at least four important implications for blockchainrelated practices in business areas, such as finance and banking, by guiding practitioners to effectively implement technology within organizations and seize value from interorganizational collaboration in strategic alliances. By doing so, we intend to provide suggestions for practitioners in organizations to build long-term cooperation and achieve sustainability in strategic alliances.Our study has at least four important implications for blockchainrelated practices in business areas, such as finance and banking, by guiding practitioners to effectively implement technology within organizations and seize value from interorganizational collaboration in strategic alliances. By doing so, we intend to provide suggestions for practitioners in organizations to build long-term cooperation and achieve sustainability in strategic alliances.</p>
        <p>First, as mentioned earlier, the successful implementation and use of blockchain are still rare. As a result, it remains unclear how blockchain can help organizations achieve benefits in practice. The basis for the implementation of blockchain is an understanding of the affordances of blockchain, given its technical features and organizational context. To succeed in blockchain implementation, organizations must carefully consider the affordances of blockchain in the business context and the compatibility of blockchain in such a context. In our cases, the identified data and process affordances of blockchain can help IT practitioners in organizations understand the applicability of blockchain with boundary conditions. That is, identifying and clarifying what blockchain could do for interorganizational relationships and how blockchain enable longterm cooperation and sustainability in strategic alliance. For example, because blockchain affords organizations the capability to trace and automate transactions in various business process with different stakeholders in the alliance, organizations which involve in complex and multi-party business and orchestrate a large network could consider investigating and implementing blockchain.First, as mentioned earlier, the successful implementation and use of blockchain are still rare.

        <p>Secondly, blockchain is an integrated technology with at least four important technical features, viz., distributed ledger, cryptography, consensus, and smart contract. Without the pre-installed four fundamental components of blockchain, the affordance of blockchain would not be realized and interorganizational trust could not be facilitated. Our findings suggest that the implementation of blockchain is not a standalone technology. Instead, it requires sufficient IT infrastructure and involves managerial changes in the process of implementation. Organizations interested in the implementation of blockchain should recognize that blockchain requires the foundation of a digital base and sufficient IT technicians. Our cases showed that the operation and maintenance of blockchain can be more time-consuming and costly than organizations' expectations. Organizations implementing blockchain could have a close cooperation between the IT technicians and business staff.Secondly, blockchain is an integrated technology with at least four important technical features, viz., distributed ledger, cryptography, consensus, and smart contract.

        <p>Thirdly, due to the tremendous changes that blockchain brings in business, it is touted as a panacea that could solve all kinds of business problems. However, we found that blockchain is more effective in contexts that highly require data encryption, authenticity, and consistency. This benefits businesses that emphasizes visible, traceable, and automated process. It may also bring symbolic benefits for organizations implementing blockchain, such as image-building. In addition, support from top managers is important for the success of blockchain implementation. Thus, organizations are highly technology-oriented and can build a corporate strategy, supporting digital transformation and eliminating authority power from centralization could be more suitable for blockchain implementation.Thirdly, due to the tremendous changes that blockchain brings in business, it is touted as a panacea that could solve all kinds of business problems.

        <p>Fourth, the business value of blockchain is not limited within an organization, but also across organizations, facilitating long-term relationships among organizations in strategic alliances. Therefore, in addition to ensuring data encryption, organizations could also pay attention to the unique value of blockchain in interorganizational collaborations, such as affordance at both the data and process levels. Blockchain benefits business processes that require process visibility, traceability, and automation. Business requires a deep level of interorganizational collaboration in strategic alliances that can consider blockchain implementation as a key component in business strategy, which can be generalizable across industries.Fourth, the business value of blockchain is not limited within an organization, but also across organizations, facilitating long-term relationships among organizations in strategic alliances.

        <p>Last but not the least, our research helps practitioners carefully consider the investment on blockchain to gain benefits in strategic alliances. Although the surge in blockchain technology has attracted attention in practice, it seems to be considered a panacea. Our study found that the implementation of blockchain systems can be more applicable in certain contexts than others as it requires a good connection between the technical features and social structures of the participating organizations. Specifically, in contexts where trust can be built via computational mechanisms and when it is not necessary to be built via social contacts, it is more appropriate to implement the blockchain. As indicated in our cases, there are frequent and huge amounts of transactions in ABS business processes, and multiple organizations participate in the processes. Therefore, organizations who are interested in addressing the requirement of interorganizational collaboration in strategic alliances to shorten transactional processes and build interorganizational trust could consider implementation of blockchain.Last but not the least, our research helps practitioners carefully consider the investment on blockchain to gain benefits in strategic alliances.

        <p>Although the theoretical and practical contributions of this study are significant, it has several limitations. First, as a case research design with two banks and their associated blockchain networks, the focus of our study is on depth rather than breadth. Generalizability is a common issue that has been criticized in case studies (Walsham, 1995). Although the findings of our study are generalizable in terms of theory, we cannot generalize in terms of statistics. Second, our study is based on interorganizational relationships between banks and their partners in financial contexts; thus, our research findings may not be applicable to a single organization or organizations in other business contexts. For example, it may be easier to manage data and trace business processes across departments in one organization than across organizations. Additionally, there may be less resistance and friction in the implementation of new technologies. Finally, blockchain is an underlying technical structure that is applicable to various IT systems. Therefore, the specific technical design of blockchain-based IT systems can vary based on particular requirements in a business context. In this study, we identify four fundamental technical features that are homogeneous in many types of blockchain-based systems, and consequently abstract the affordance of blockchain technology.Although the theoretical and practical contributions of this study are significant, it has several limitations.

        <p>Future research can consider conducting empirical studies by collecting data from multiple cases of blockchain technology implementation in different industries or collecting quantitative data by following the paradigm of quantitative research to validate our research findings. It can also consider putting more effort into investigating how a single organization in contexts other than finance could benefit from implementing a blockchain. Future research should further scrutinize the detailed capabilities and affordance of a specific blockchain technology and compare it with other varieties of blockchain.Future research can consider conducting empirical studies by collecting data from multiple cases of blockchain technology implementation in different industries or collecting quantitative data by following the paradigm of quantitative research to validate our research findings.

        <p>The financial sector and other industries have experimented with blockchain to create technology-based alliances. The popularity of blockchain technology and its proliferation in various contexts call for an investigation of the role of blockchain in achieving organizational outcomes. Empirical studies that illustrate how organizations benefit from the implementation of this disruptive technology are lacking. To fill this gap, we examined the implementation of a blockchain-based ABS system in interorganizational relationships in a strategic alliance by adopting the technology affordance perspective. This exploratory study provided empirical cases of the implementation of blockchain in a business alliance network in the financial sector. The empirical data demonstrated the interaction among technology artifacts, its data and process affordance, and its contribution to building interorganizational trust among business partners. We identified four fundamental technical features of blockchain, affordances, and derived interorganizational trust by implementing blockchain. Most importantly, we investigated how the technical features of blockchain afford organizational collaborations in ABS business at both the data and process levels, and how the affordances facilitate trust and dependence between organizations. By proposing a high-level conceptual model of the role of blockchain in cultivating interorganizational trust, this case offers both conceptual and practical insights to researchers and practitioners. We expect more in-depth studies to further advance our understanding and implementation of blockchain technology to transform our society.The financial sector and other industries have experimented with blockchain to create technology-based alliances.
