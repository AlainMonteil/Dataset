        <p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide 1 . Despite growing awareness of the role of sex and gender in the management of CVD, females continue to experience delays in diagnosis and treatment 2,3 , are referred and participate less in cardiac rehabilitation 4 , are not sufficiently represented in clinical trials 5 , and as a consequence may often suffer worse outcomes.Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide 1 .

        <p>In the medical literature, the terms "sex" and "gender" are interchangeably used, generating confusion. Sex refers to the biological characteristics of an individual determined by chromosomal complement and sex hormones. The impact of these biological factors on CV risk are well established [6][7][8][9] . For instance, low levels of estrogen in younger females are associated with an increased risk of CVD 10,11 , while declining estrogen levels following the menopause, in addition to advancing age, are associated with unfavorable lipid profiles 12 , blood pressure (BP) elevation and increased CV risk 13 . Moreover, pregnancy related complications such as gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia may alter this risk as well as endocrine disorders, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome, which may promote CVD 14,15 .In the medical literature, the terms "sex" and "gender" are interchangeably used, generating confusion.

        <p>Beyond sex, gender derives from the social, cultural and behavioral factors that may modulate health 16,17 . Gender is a multidimensional concept that incorporates identity (i.e. an inner sense of masculinity, femininity and gender non-conforming), role (i.e. societal and environmental expectations), relations (i.e., interpersonal interactions and dynamics), and institutionalized gender (i.e., distribution of power in political, educational, social institutions in society) 18 . Gender may significantly influence health-related behaviors and interact with CV risk factors 19 .Beyond sex, gender derives from the social, cultural and behavioral factors that may modulate health 16,17 .

A greater understanding of both sex and gender differences is required to drive improvements in diagnosis, treatment and outcomes. In this narrative review, based on our prior work on the topic and available literature, we summarize current knowledge of the role of gender in the development of cardiovascular risk, its impact upon established cardiovascular risk factors and the means by which it can be measured in clinical research. Using the terms males/men and females/women can be somewhat confusing. Here, we use the terms males/females to the purely biological and men/women to gender, or when these factors are not clear.Importantly, these concept may intersect and interact with one another 20 .

        <p>Gender contributes to CV health of women and men both directly and indirectly through the acquisition of other risk factors (Table 1). As such, the role of each gender domain (i.e., identity, roles, relations, institutions) and its interaction with biological sex in CVD manifestation, progression, and outcome deserve further investigation. The mechanisms by which detrimental characteristics ascribed to women in most cultures (i.e., poverty, low level jobs, and lower pay) modify CVD risk are multifaceted.Gender contributes to CV health of women and men both directly and indirectly through the acquisition of other risk factors (Table 1).

        <p>Gender identity describes a person's intrinsic sense of their gender (i.e. man, woman, non-binary, gender neutral or fluid, etc.). It is important to note that gender identity may be the same (cisgender), or different (transgender, gender neutral) from biological sex assigned at birth. The underlying mechanism between gender identity and CVD risk is poorly understood and is likely mediated through other gender domains. Personality traits, stress level at work and home, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f emotional intelligence, depression, anxiety and childhood trauma are examples of this dimension 18, 21, 22 (Table 1).Gender identity describes a person's intrinsic sense of their gender (i.e. man, woman, non-binary, gender neutral or fluid, etc.).

        <p>Personality traits including anger, hostility, type D (distressed) personality and psychosocial stress are associated with an adverse CVD prognosis [23][24][25] . The impact of stress in increasing CVD, is not uniform in men and women.

        <p>Similarly, depression is recognized as a risk factor for CVD which can worsen outcomes in IHD and stroke 26 . Women are twice as likely to develop depression during their lifetime compared to men 27 , which consequently increases cardiac events [28][29][30] . Women with increased negative affect also have increased levels of BMI, BP and CV events 31 . Stress and psychological factors' contribution to poor CVD outcomes is complex, however, it has been hypothesized that even exposure to trauma at a young age leads to an increased susceptibility to adverse lifestyle behaviors such as substance abuse, poor diet, and sedentary lifestyle 32 .Similarly, depression is recognized as a risk factor for CVD which can worsen outcomes in IHD and stroke 26 .

        <p>There are several gendered aspects which contribute to the roles of individuals in society: primary earner status, employment status, occupation type, paid and unpaid (i.e., caregiver hours) work hours, caregiver responsibilities, household responsibilities, and number of children 18, 21, 22, 33 (Table 1). Roles largely vary across cultures, therefore their effect on CV risk might be different among countries.There are several gendered aspects which contribute to the roles of individuals in society: primary earner status, employment status, occupation type, paid and unpaid (i.e., caregiver hours) work hours, caregiver responsibilities, household responsibilities, and number of children 18, 21, 22, 33 (Table 1).

        <p>A recent study demonstrated that young women with ACS are less likely to have primary earner status and have lower personal income, when compared to their men counterparts 34 . Job J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f strain has been shown to negatively impact cardiometabolic risk factors (diabetes, smoking, physical inactivity, obesity) 35 , which in turn increases the risk of IHD, and mortality 35,36 . Other studies have also shown dose-response associations between shift work 37 and longer work hours 38 with increased risk of CV events 37,38 . Conversely, while women and men with the same occupational level may have a similar response to stress at work, women's stress level remains high even after work, which may be due to greater household and childcare responsibilities 39,40 , suggesting a more detrimental effect of those factors on women's CV health.A recent study demonstrated that young women with ACS are less likely to have primary earner status and have lower personal income, when compared to their men counterparts 34 .

        <p>Gender relations refer to the relationship and interaction of individuals based on their gender identity (i.e., marital/relationship status, family or local network, social support, and availability of caretaker (for self)) 18,21,22 . Such factors have important impact on overall disease outcomes 41,42 (Table 1). Marital stress has been shown to increase the risk of recurrent cardiac events in women with established IHD 43 . A recent study investigating living arrangements and CVD outcome, showed that women living with spouse and children are two times more likely to have IHD compared to those living with just their spouse 44 . Married men had a lower risk of MI incidence independent from other socioeconomic factors such as education, occupation, income, wealth and employment 45 . Moreover, living alone in men and cohabitation in women were associated with a greater risk of fatality post-MI compared to being married 45 .Gender relations refer to the relationship and interaction of individuals based on their gender identity (i.e., marital/relationship status, family or local network, social support, and availability of caretaker (for self)) 18,21,22 .

        <p>Institutionalized gender (i.e., educational attainment level, socioeconomic status (SES), Gender inequality index (GII)) 18,21,22 refers to the distribution of wealth, power, and opportunity in society (Table 1). Studies have shown that lower SES is associated with increased risk of IHD and stroke. Women with a low education level are at 34% and 23% higher risk of IHD and CVD compared to men with low education 46 . Moreover, lower subjective SES (one's perception of their socioeconomic position) has been associated with acquiring traditional risk factors and the development of CVD 47 . Currently women make up 60% of the world's poor and 66% of world's illiterate population 48 . The lower socioeconomic status of women is a significant predictor of CV death and MI regardless of angiographic CAD extent, chest pain, and other traditional risk factors 49 . Furthermore, women are less likely to be insured through their employment and are more likely to be financially dependent 50 , thereby with reducing access to healthcare services.Institutionalized gender (i.e., educational attainment level, socioeconomic status (SES), Gender inequality index (GII)) 18,21,22 refers to the distribution of wealth, power, and opportunity in society (Table 1).

        <p>These factors and their impact on CV health are gendered in that they show different prevalence and impact on diseases not solely due to biological differences between males and females but in relationship with differences in roles, relationships and identity between men and women in society.These factors and their impact on CV health are gendered in that they show different prevalence and impact on diseases not solely due to biological differences between males and females but in relationship with differences in roles, relationships and identity between men and women in society.</p>
        <p>The Framingham Heart study coined the term coronary risk factors (hypertension, smoking, diabetes and dyslipidaemia) as major determinants of CVD risk and these were later described as 'traditional' risk factors 51,52 . Although males and females share these risk factors, their prevalence differs across the life span and some factors are more potent in females than in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f males. Risk assessment tools, such as the Framingham Heart Score, that only utilise traditional risk factors, underestimate CV risk in women due to the absence of psychosocial assessment, and the estimation of short-term CV risk opposed to lifetime risk, which is more suitable in females who live longer 53 . The identification of 'non-traditional' risk factors has furthered our understanding of CVD risk and how these factors can contribute to differences in CVD between men and women (Figure 1). Sex differences in these established CV risk factors have been reviewed extensively elsewhere 6 . However, the role of gender in a modifying these risk factors and how gender can potentially explain well-known sex differences is less well described or understood. Below, are provided examples of this relationship. For each risk factor, we first briefly report on sex differences, followed by data, when available, on the role of gender for understanding the observed sex differences in CVD risk factors.The Framingham Heart study coined the term coronary risk factors (hypertension, smoking, diabetes and dyslipidaemia) as major determinants of CVD risk and these were later described as 'traditional' risk factors 51,52 .

        <p>A prospective UK biobank study of almost 500,000 individuals has demonstrated an 80% higher relative risk of myocardial infarction (MI) in females with hypertension compared to males 54 . Sex differences in BP are mediated by variations in RAAS, bradykinin and nitric oxide systems and are believed to be predominantly sex hormone mediated 55 . These differences begin in adolescence, when boys demonstrate higher BP than girls 56 , and extend into later life where more males have hypertension until the sixth decade, where thereafter this is more prevalent in females 57 . In a longitudinal BP analysis of 32,833 individuals, females exhibited a sharper incline in BP, commencing and persisting from their third decade compared to males 58 . This divergence in BP trajectory may influence CVD risk later in life and mediate the sex differences observed in CVD, which present differently between sexes. The cause of this progressive BP J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f elevation in females is unknown and potentially multifaceted. The influence of sex-related hormonal, genetic and epigenetic differences on BP are evident and likely to play a significant role 59 . However, gendered social, economic and environmental factors may facilitate alterations in vascular biology and alter BP in women. In a recent analysis of 59 805 French adults from the CONSTANCES cohort, relative socioeconomic status, and in particular education inequality, demonstrated stronger associations with hypertension prevalence in women compared to men 60 , thereby demonstrating the potential impact of gender on BP.A prospective UK biobank study of almost 500,000 individuals has demonstrated an 80% higher relative risk of myocardial infarction (MI) in females with hypertension compared to males 54 .

        <p>Smoking is another leading risk factor that substantially increases CVD risk 61,62 . The interaction between CVD, sex and smoking first became evident in a prospective study of ~25,000 individuals, where the relative risk of MI in women who smoke exceeded that of men by &gt;50% 63 . In a meta-analysis of over 2.4 million individuals and more than 44,000 IHD events, women who smoke, compared to non-smokers, have a 25% higher relative risk for IHD compared to men who smoke 61 . Whether the etiology of this excess risk in women is a consequence of gender-mediated smoking behaviors or cigarette toxin-sex interaction is unknown. However, as smoking prevalence, consumption and cumulative exposure is higher in men, this risk factor appears to be a more potent in women and therefore potentially sex mediated 62,[64][65][66] .Smoking is another leading risk factor that substantially increases CVD risk 61,62 .

        <p>Physical activity is inversely associated with CV mortality, with or without established CVD [67][68][69] . In the Women's Health Study, physical activity reduced IHD and stroke independently of traditional CV risk factors 70 . Importantly, females across the spectrum of CV risk benefited from regular exercise. This association is also true for females with diabetes 71 . In the INTERHEART (The Effect of Potentially Modifiable Risk Factors Associated with Myocardial Infarction) case-control study of 15,152 cases of MI, the protective effect of exercise was greater in females (OR 0.5 [95% CI 0.4, 0.6]) than in males (OR 0.8[95% CI 0.7-0.9]) 72 .Physical activity is inversely associated with CV mortality, with or without established CVD [67][68][69] .

        <p>Despite the potential beneficial effects of exercise on CVR risk, women are generally less physically active than men 73 . This reduction in physical activity may be attributed to the prioritisation of social roles traditionally ascribed to women, including caregiving and chores in the home setting, and promotes adverse cardiometabolic risk factors in women compared to men 74, 75 61, 75-80 . Consequently, obesity rates are higher in females compared to males and continues to rise 81 . In HF, females who are obese demonstrate greater increases in left ventricular mass than obese males 82 . Obesity affects almost 50% of patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction 83 , which occurs more commonly in females. Lower rates of obesity are observed in HF with reduced ejection fraction, which in turn is more prevalent in males. This observation suggests the presence of a sex-obesity interaction, that may be driven by a gender-influenced utilization of exercise.Despite the potential beneficial effects of exercise on CVR risk, women are generally less physically active than men 73 .

        <p>Type 2 diabetes elevates the risk for CVD in both sexes. A meta-analysis of participant level data comprising almost 1 million individuals with no previous vascular disease has J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f demonstrated that diabetes doubles the risk of CV mortality due to IHD or ischemic stroke in males and triples risk among females 84 . Mortality was six times higher in middle aged females (aged 35-59 years) with diabetes compared to those without. Comparatively, mortality was doubled for men in this age group. Indeed, the female protective CV advantage evident in the wider population prior to the menopause is lost in this condition 85 . Importantly, in individuals with ACS, a higher prevalence of adverse psychological factors (primary earner status, depression, anxiety and worse physical health perceptions) is observed in women with diabetes, compared to women without diabetes or men with diabetes 86 . These findings may in part explain the increased risk in women and exemplifies the intersection between sex and gender in the modulation of CV risk.Type 2 diabetes elevates the risk for CVD in both sexes.

        <p>Dyslipidemia is a major contributor to CVD mortality and morbidity. When compared to age matched-females, males a have a more pro-atherogenic lipid profile with lower high-density lipoprotein, and higher low-density lipoprotein and triglycerides 87 . Interestingly, in a prospective study of young males and females with acute MI (Variation in Recovery: Role of Gender on Outcomes of Young AMI Patients study [VIRGO]), lipid measurements taken following discharge post-MI were more favorable in females compared to males 88 . This is despite young females with AMI having a higher risk of mortality when compared to young males. In the VIRGO cohort, there were no differences in statin adherence by sex, suggesting that dyslipidemia may not be a major factor contributing to differences in outcomes observed between sexes at least in younger age categories albeit novel lipid factors such as Lpa may prove to be more significant in females 88 .Dyslipidemia is a major contributor to CVD mortality and morbidity.

        <p>The paucity of data regarding the effect of gender on CVD risk is a consequence of the lack of standardized methods to measure gender and is a limitation in the data provided (Table 1). Thus, creating a sex-and gender-based framework to analyze and report outcomes is imperative 19,34,[89][90][91][92][93][94][95] (Figure 2).

        <p>The Bem Sex-Role Inventory (BSRI) is a measure of masculinity and femininity and is an example of a questionnaire used to assess gender identity. It assesses how people identify themselves psychologically and assesses each person's personality traits. This score was also used to examine psychological androgyny [92][93][94] . The major limitation of this tool is its focus on only personality traits and disregard of other dimensions of gender.The Bem Sex-Role Inventory (BSRI) is a measure of masculinity and femininity and is an example of a questionnaire used to assess gender identity.

        <p>In 1990, Lipa and Connelly 89 introduced a gender diagnosticity approach which refers to gender as the Bayesian probability of an individual to be a man or a woman on the basis of a set of gender-related diagnostic factors which may vary across different populations and times.In 1990, Lipa and Connelly 89 introduced a gender diagnosticity approach which refers to gender as the Bayesian probability of an individual to be a man or a woman on the basis of a set of gender-related diagnostic factors which may vary across different populations and times.</p>

        <p>Recently the GENESIS-PRAXY (GENdEr and Sex determInantS of cardiovascular disease: From bench to beyond-Premature Acute Coronary SYndrome) investigators 19,34 built a composite measure of gender, the GENESIS-PRAXY Gender Index (GGI) to assess the impact of gender variables from all dimensions to resolve the inherent statistical difficulties associated with addressing a large amount of gender-related variables and to distinguish the effect of gender from sex on CVD risk factors and outcomes. This study is unique in its creation of a gender index based on several gender-related variables using PCA and propensity score methods, referred as the GENESIS-PRAXY methodology. This approach was derived in accordance with the study of gender diagnosticity by Lippa and Connelly (57). GGI was calculated through the construction of a propensity score, which was derived from coefficient estimates in the logistic regression model with biological sex as dependent variable and gender variables as covariates.Recently the GENESIS-PRAXY (GENdEr and Sex determInantS of cardiovascular disease: From bench to beyond-Premature Acute Coronary SYndrome) investigators 19,34 built a composite measure of gender, the GENESIS-PRAXY Gender Index (GGI) to assess the impact of gender variables from all dimensions to resolve the inherent statistical difficulties associated with addressing a large amount of gender-related variables and to distinguish the effect of gender from sex on CVD risk factors and outcomes.

        <p>Gender Variables including number of hours per week doing housework, primary responsibility doing housework, level of stress at home, BSR femininity score, lower personal income, not being primary earner were correlated with biological female sex. The propensity score for each person was defined as the conditional probability of being a female versus a male based on gender-related variables. GGI ranges from 0-100, with higher scores relating to characteristics traditionally ascribed to women 19,34 . Of note, a higher GGI (i.e. feminine characteristics; higher number of hours per week doing housework, primary responsibility doing housework, higher level of stress at home, BSR femininity score, lower personal income, not being primary earner) were associated with an increased risk of CV risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, and depression and greater risk of recurrent ACS over 12 months independently of sex 19 . This is J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f partly because traditional CV risk factors are further potentiated by gendered factors in a way that is more detrimental to women than men. Indeed, the inclusion of the GGI in another population based study revealed that individuals in a general population with feminine gender characteristics, regardless of sex, exhibit poorer CV health 97 .Gender Variables including number of hours per week doing housework, primary responsibility doing housework, level of stress at home, BSR femininity score, lower personal income, not being primary earner were correlated with biological female sex.

        <p>Despite numerous attempts to investigate gender disparities in CV outcomes, the impact of sex and gender-related aspects on CV risk factors and the concept of gendered risk factors as possible modifiable targets for CVD prevention is underdeveloped. Limited awareness of the role gender plays in etiology, process of care and outcome of CVD spans from clinical scientists to practicing clinicians. Thus, the inclusion of gender-related factors in addition to established CV risk factors in clinical studies is imperative, to understand and improve disease prevention and outcomes (Figure2). Such aspects are even more relevant in the era of precision medicine, which aims to provide tailored disease management, taking into account genetic, psychosocial and environmental influences 98 . Much enthusiasm is placed in innovative methods such as advanced biomedical artificial intelligence to significantly improve risk prediction. However, to really improve prediction, these methods must incorporate important dimensions such as sex and gender in algorithms to fully realize the potential of precision medicine.Despite numerous attempts to investigate gender disparities in CV outcomes, the impact of sex and gender-related aspects on CV risk factors and the concept of gendered risk factors as possible modifiable targets for CVD prevention is underdeveloped.

        <p>Gender is an evolving and dynamic process influenced by the social context in which each J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f person is embedded, its expression may differ across various environments (domestic, racial, socioeconomic, geopolitical), and time. Gender-related characteristics that shape an individual from early life to adulthood can interact with each other and sex, which can ultimately impact the CV well-being of each individual. Indeed, based on the present review, the future CV research agenda should focus on assessing and comparing gender-related factors associated with CV health within different sexes, so as to achieve more individualized approaches in medicine.Gender is an evolving and dynamic process influenced by the social context in which each J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f person is embedded, its expression may differ across various environments (domestic, racial, socioeconomic, geopolitical), and time.
