        <p>Purpose -Recent figures show that users are discontinuing their usage of 
            <rs type="software">TripAdvisor</rs>, the leading user-generated content (UGC) platform in the tourism sector. Hence, it is relevant to study the factors that influence travelers' continued use of 
            <rs type="software">TripAdvisor</rs>.
        </p>
        <p>Design/methodology/approach -We have integrated constructs from the Technology Acceptance Model, Information Systems (IS) Continuance Model, and eWOM literature. We used PLS-SEM (
            <rs type="software">smartPLS</rs> V.3
            <rs type="version">.2.8</rs>) to test our hypotheses using data from 297 users of 
            <rs type="software">TripAdvisor</rs> recruited through 
            <rs type="software">Prolific</rs>.
        </p>
        <p>Findings -Findings reveal that perceived ease of use, online consumer review (OCR) credibility, and OCR usefulness have a positive impact on customer satisfaction, which ultimately leads to continuance intention of UGC platforms. Customer satisfaction mediates the effect of the independent variables on continuance intention.Findings -Findings reveal that perceived ease of use, online consumer review (OCR) credibility, and OCR usefulness have a positive impact on customer satisfaction, which ultimately leads to continuance intention of UGC platforms.

        <p>Practical implications -Managers of UGC platforms (i.e. 
            <rs type="software">TripAdvisor</rs>) can benefit from the findings of this study. Specifically, they should improve the ease of use of their platforms by facilitating travelers' information searches. Moreover, they should use signals to make credible and helpful content stand out from the crowd of reviews.
        </p>
        <p>Originality/value -This is the first study that adopts the IS Continuance Model in the travel and tourism literature to research the factors influencing consumers' continued use of travelbased UGC platforms. Moreover, we have extended this model by including new constructs that are particularly relevant to UGC platforms, such as performance heuristics and OCR credibility.Originality/value -This is the first study that adopts the IS Continuance Model in the travel and tourism literature to research the factors influencing consumers' continued use of travelbased UGC platforms.

        <p>Reading online consumer reviews (OCRs) before a purchase has become a habit for many consumers. OCRs, the textual format of electronic word of mouth (eWOM), have become influential at the different stages of consumers' decision-making: from information search to alternatives evaluation and from purchase decision to post-purchase (Filieri et al., 2018b;Dedeoğlu et al., 2020). TripAdvisor.com, a Boston-based company founded in 2000, pioneered travel-based eWOM (Litvin et al., 2018) by enabling, for the first time, travelers to leave feedback (i.e. consumer review) about their experience with accommodation.Reading online consumer reviews (OCRs) before a purchase has become a habit for many consumers.

            <rs type="software">TripAdvisor</rs> is a game-changer in the travel and tourism industry by becoming, in a few years, the largest online travel guide, with 411 million visitors visiting every month to browse over 700 million travel reviews available (
            <rs type="software">TripAdvisor</rs>, 2019;Gretzel and Yoo, 2008). The platform provides reviews, ratings, photos, and forums about the services associated with planning a trip, such as tour guides, car rentals, tourist attractions, restaurants, and accommodations.
        </p>
        <p>However, TripAdvisor's average monthly unique users have been falling from 490 million in 2018 to 411 million in the first quarter of 2019 (Bhagat, 2019;Dedeoğlu et al., 2020). Industry experts say one of the reasons behind the fall could be the aggressive competition in Google (Singh, 2019). Google reviews about hospitality services have been steadily growing and have become the favorite platform for mobile searches, which has driven traffic away from TripAdvisor (Singh, 2019;Gurman and Carville, 2020). Another reason could be that consumers' trust in TripAdvisor has fallen in recent years, mainly due to high-profile stories of fake and promotional reviews posted on the website (Filieri, 2016;The Guardian, 2019). Hence, it is relevant, from both a managerial and an academic perspective, to understand whether this platform will continue to be a leading actor in the travel and tourism industry.However, TripAdvisor's average monthly unique users have been falling from 490 million in 2018 to 411 million in the first quarter of 2019 (Bhagat, 2019;Dedeoğlu et al., 2020).

        <p>Travel and tourism scholars have mainly focused on consumers' technology initial adoption. Existing studies have researched the factors influencing restaurant customers' adoption of food mobile applications (Okumus et al., 2018) as well as travelers' adoption of user-generated content (e.g. Ayeh et al., 2013;Filieri and McLeay, 2014) and travel technology like mobile apps (Morosan, 2014;Gupta et al., 2018;Lu et al., 2015;Young Im and Hancer, 2014). Yet, a limited number of studies have investigated technology continuance intention in the travel and tourism industry (Jung et al., 2018;Ozturk et al., 2016a, b;Ukpabi et al., 2019).Travel and tourism scholars have mainly focused on consumers' technology initial adoption.

        <p>In the information systems (IS) literature, scholars contend that successful technology adoption depends on continuance intention rather than initial technology adoption (Bhattacherjee, 2001). Drawing on the expectation-confirmation theory (Oliver, 1980), Bhattacherjee (2001) developed the Information Systems/Technology (IS/IT) Continuance Model to explain the factors influencing users' continuance intention of IS. The IS/IT Continuance Model has been applied to different contexts, such as online banking, mobile commerce, mobile payments, mobile apps, social networking websites, e-learning systems, online flight check-in, blogging, virtual communities, chatbots, and many more (e.g. Ashfaq et al., 2020;Gan and Li, 2018;Gao et al., 2015;Kim, 2011;Liang et al., 2011;Lin and Filieri, 2015;Roca and Gagné, 2008;Talwar et al., 2020).In the information systems (IS) literature, scholars contend that successful technology adoption depends on continuance intention rather than initial technology adoption (Bhattacherjee, 2001).

        <p>Despite the relevance of the topic, there is a scarcity of research on the drivers of user's continuance intention in the travel and tourism industry. To fill this gap, we adopt, for the first time in the travel and tourism research context, the IS/IT Continuance Model (usefulness, satisfaction) (Bhattacherjee, 2001) to study the continuance intention of UGC platforms. Our theoretical contribution lies in expanding the model by including constructs from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (i.e. ease of use); and relevant constructs from the eWOM literature, such as performance heuristics, perceived online consumer review (OCR) usefulness, and credibility, which have been consistently found to influence travelers' intention and behavior (Chakraborty, 2019;Cheung et al., 2008;Cheung et al., 2009;Filieri, 2015;Filieri et al., 2018a;Park and Nicolau, 2015;Viglia et al., 2016;Ye et al., 2011).Despite the relevance of the topic, there is a scarcity of research on the drivers of user's continuance intention in the travel and tourism industry.

        <p>The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is one of the most influential and wellrecognized frameworks in information systems research (Benbasat and Barki, 2007). Davis' TAM (1989) includes two key constructs: perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU). PU and PEOU are both argued to be key determinants of user acceptance of technologies, as they affect attitudes towards using a particular technology, which, in turn, influences the user's intention to adopt it. PU is defined as 'the degree to which a person believes that using a particular technology will enhance his or her job performance', while PEOU refers to 'a user's perception of how easily a particular application can be used' (Davis, 1989, p. 320). TAM constructs have been frequently used to explain technology adoption in several contexts (Wu and Chen, 2017).The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is one of the most influential and wellrecognized frameworks in information systems research (Benbasat and Barki, 2007).

        <p>Drawing upon the Expectation-Confirmation Theory (ECT) (Oliver, 1980) and the TAM (Davis, 1989), Bhattacherjee (2001) developed the IS/IT Continuance Model to explain post-adoption behavior. Bhattacherjee (2001) noticed that technology acceptance models did not fully explain observed IS continuance behavior and that continued use, rather than firsttime use, indicates its successful implementation (Bhattacherjee, 2001). The IS/IT Continuance Model explains that, after initial use, users' perceptions of information systems usefulness and satisfaction may change, leading to either repeated behavior or discontinued usage (Bhattacherjee, 2001;Limayem et al., 2007). Bhattacherjee (2001) developed a model in which confirmation of prior expectations and perceived usefulness (expectations of benefits from future usage), and overall evaluations of the outcomes following prior usageoften referred to as user satisfactionrepresent the key antecedents of continuance intention.Drawing upon the Expectation-Confirmation Theory (ECT) (Oliver, 1980) and the TAM (Davis, 1989), Bhattacherjee (2001) developed the IS/IT Continuance Model to explain post-adoption behavior.

        <p>The IS/IT continuance intention model has been adopted to explain technology continued use in a variety of research settings, including mobile apps (Lu et al., 2015), question and answer communities (Fang and Zhang, 2019), e-learning platforms (Roca and Gagné, 2008), cloud computing (Yang and Lin, 2015), online banking (Bhattacherjee, 2001), web 2.0 (Chen et al., 2012), social media (e.g. Gan and Li, 2018;Jung et al., 2018;Kim, 2011;Liang et al., 2011;Mouakket, 2015;Oliveira et al., 2016), blogs (Shiau and Luo, 2013;Tang et al., 2014), online knowledge transfer (e.g. Fang and Chiu, 2010;Zheng et al., 2013); chatbots (Ashfaq et al., 2020); online flight check-in (Lin and Filieri, 2015); mobile payments (Talwar et al., 2020).The IS/IT continuance intention model has been adopted to explain technology continued use in a variety of research settings, including mobile apps (Lu et al., 2015), question and answer communities (Fang and Zhang, 2019), e-learning platforms (Roca and Gagné, 2008), cloud computing (Yang and Lin, 2015), online banking (Bhattacherjee, 2001), web 2.0 (Chen et al., 2012), social media (e.g. Gan and Li, 2018;Jung et al., 2018;Kim, 2011;Liang et al., 2011;Mouakket, 2015;Oliveira et al., 2016), blogs (Shiau and Luo, 2013;Tang et al., 2014), online knowledge transfer (e.g. Fang and Chiu, 2010;Zheng et al., 2013); chatbots (Ashfaq et al., 2020); online flight check-in (Lin and Filieri, 2015); mobile payments (Talwar et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>However, the IS/IT Continuance Model has not yet been adopted in research on technologies adopted by travelers (Jung et al., 2008) and specifically on travel-based UGC platforms.

        <p>Travel and tourism scholars have mostly focused on the factors affecting the initial adoption of a technology (e.g. Ayeh et al., 2013;Gupta et al., 2018;Law et al., 2019;Lu et al., 2015;Okumus et al., 2018;Tom Dieck et al., 2017), while few studies have been carried out on CI. Leung and Bai (2013) study revisit intention and found that involvement with the hotel social media page affects travelers' intention to revisit the hotel's social media account. Drawing upon motivation theory and self-determination theory, Ozturk et al. (2016a) reveal that utilitarian value and hedonic value are significant antecedents of consumers' CI of mobile hotel booking technology (apps and websites). Jung et al. (2018) assess the role of trust, perceived benefits, and perceived enjoyment on continued social media use, revealing that these constructs mediate the relationship between interaction, ubiquity, and continued use of social media. Ukpabi et al. (2019) investigated the role of offline activities and customer value creation on tourists' continued use of online travel communities. Kang and Namkung (2019) integrated the theory of privacy calculus and the TAM for researching customers' responses toward personalization in the context of mobile branded apps. From the review of this literature, it is evident that there is a dearth of studies on the determinants of CI of travelbased UGC platforms. By integrating TAM (i.e. ease of use), the IS/IT Continuance Model (i.e. usefulness, customer satisfaction) (Bhattacherjee, 2001), and eWOM constructs (i.e. perceived OCR credibility and performance heuristics), we aim to make a theoretical contribution to both the travel and tourism as well as the IS/IT literature.Travel and tourism scholars have mostly focused on the factors affecting the initial adoption of a technology (e.g. Ayeh et al., 2013;Gupta et al., 2018;Law et al., 2019;Lu et al., 2015;Okumus et al., 2018;Tom Dieck et al., 2017), while few studies have been carried out on CI.

        <p>Consumer ratings are performance heuristics typical of user-generated and social commerce platforms (Filieri and McLeay, 2014;Sparks and Browning, 2011). By helping consumers rapidly identify the options that are best for them (based on many other users' evaluations), consumer ratings may drive customer satisfaction and CI of UGC platforms.Consumer ratings are performance heuristics typical of user-generated and social commerce platforms (Filieri and McLeay, 2014;Sparks and Browning, 2011).

        <p>Previous studies have shown the significant influence of consumer ratings on consumer behavior, including booking intentions, consumer choice, information evaluation, and adoption (e.g. Filieri and McLeay, 2014;Filieri, 2015;Sparks and Browning, 2011;Ye et al., 2011;Filieri et al., 2020). Another stream of research has proved that ratings also affect business performance indicators such as hotel sales and occupancy rates (e.g. Raguseo and Vitari, 2017;Viglia et al., 2016). Travelers adopt and follow the purchase recommendations contained in OCRs because they are diagnostic information, that is, they help consumers understand the quality and performance of products and services before buying them (e.g. Filieri, 2015;Mariani and Borghi, 2020). Moreover, travelers adopt OCRs because they view them as honest and reliable accounts about customer's experience with products and services (e.g. Cheung et al., 2009;Filieri, 2016). Furthermore, we also included perceived ease of use of online reviews, a TAM factor that has been used to explain technology adoption and trust in previous studies on TripAdvisor (Ayeh et al., 2013) and e-commerce research (e.g. Ahn et al., 2007). However, little research has adopted TAM (Davis, 1989) to explain technology's continued usage (Wang et al., 2013;Wu and Chen, 2017).Previous studies have shown the significant influence of consumer ratings on consumer behavior, including booking intentions, consumer choice, information evaluation, and adoption (e.g. Filieri and McLeay, 2014;Filieri, 2015;Sparks and Browning, 2011;Ye et al., 2011;Filieri et al., 2020).

        <p>Services are intangible, perishable, heterogeneous, and inseparable, and consumers cannot evaluate them objectively before buying or trying them (Mitchell and Greatorex, 1993;Litvin et al., 2018). These characteristics of services increase the level of risk embedded in their purchase (Murray and Schlacter, 1990). Thus, obtaining reliable information is particularly important to reduce risk in travelers' decision-making (Lin et al., 2009). Over the years, OCRs represent a critical information source for travelers to evaluate travel services before experiencing them (Filieri, 2016;Dedeoğlu et al., 2020). OCRs are deemed to provide honest feedback from customers who have already purchased a travel service. Much research on eWOM has focused on source credibility theories (e.g. Filieri, 2015;Lo and Yao, 2019), neglecting the role of message credibility. Review message credibility is defined as the consumers' perception that the information contained in a review is 'believable, true, or factual' (Cheung et al., 2009, p. 12). Reviewers can post two-sided reviews, including both positive and negative feedback about the services they experienced.Services are intangible, perishable, heterogeneous, and inseparable, and consumers cannot evaluate them objectively before buying or trying them (Mitchell and Greatorex, 1993;Litvin et al., 2018).

        <p>In advertising and eWOM research, scholars revealed that two-sided reviews improve the perceived credibility as well as the perceived helpfulness of information (Filieri et al., 2018b) and the effectiveness of advertisements (Kamins et al., 1989). Scholars have also demonstrated that perceived message credibility is one of the most important antecedents of recommendation adoption (Cheung et al., 2009) and purchase intention (Filieri, 2016;Chakraborty, 2019). Drawing on these studies, we argue that if consumers consistently obtain reliable information, their willingness to reuse the same platform in the future will increase.In advertising and eWOM research, scholars revealed that two-sided reviews improve the perceived credibility as well as the perceived helpfulness of information (Filieri et al., 2018b) and the effectiveness of advertisements (Kamins et al., 1989).

        <p>Accordingly, the confirmation of the expectation regarding the reliability of the information in OCRs will also reduce consumers' perceived risk. Furthermore, consumers mainly focus on the message and use several cues when they try to assess the credibility of online reviews for high involvement purchases (Filieri, 2016). By providing credible information, UGC platforms can also reduce information processing time and consumer's cognitive effort (Bellman et al., 2006), which would eventually drive satisfaction and intention to reuse the platform in the future.

        <p>Perceived usefulness is defined as "the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her job performance" (Davis, 1989, p. 320). Perceived usefulness is one of the most critical determinants of technology adoption, and it is a key construct in the TAM (Davis, 1989), as well as in the IS/IT Continuance Model (Bhattacherjee, 2001). Previous studies found that perceived usefulness significantly affects user satisfaction (Lee and Kwon, 2011) and continuance intention (e.g. Al-Maghrabi et al., 2011;Bhattacherjee, 2001;Kim, 2011;Liao et al., 2007;Mouakket, 2015;Tang et al., 2014).Perceived usefulness is defined as "the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her job performance" (Davis, 1989, p. 320).

Previous studies found that perceived usefulness significantly affects user satisfaction (Lee and Kwon, 2011) and continuance intention (e.g. Al-Maghrabi et al., 2011;Bhattacherjee, 2001;Kim, 2011;Liao et al., 2007;Mouakket, 2015;Tang et al., 2014).</p>
        <p>In this study, perceived usefulness refers to the review content and not to the technology or platform itself. It is the usefulness of the information contained in OCRs that can improve consumers' knowledge of and familiarity with the product/service (Cheung et al., 2008;Filieri, 2015).In this study, perceived usefulness refers to the review content and not to the technology or platform itself.

        <p>Useful OCRs are highly regarded by users as they provide valuable information that they would not be able to retrieve elsewhere (Filieri and McLeay, 2014). Useful OCRs provide diagnostic information that enables consumers to better understand the quality of a product and how it is likely to perform before purchasing it (Filieri, 2015). Hence, they are particularly influential in consumer decision-making as they affect information diagnosticity, consumer's purchase intentions (Filieri et al., 2018), and product sales (Ghose and Ipeirotis, 2010). They also moderate the impact of review valence on financial performance (Mariani and Borghi, 2020). Drawing on these studies, we hypothesize that perceived OCRs' usefulness would enhance customer satisfaction and willingness to use the same UGC platform again in the future. Hence, we hypothesize the following: Hypothesis 2a: Perceived review usefulness has a positive impact on CS.

        <p>Perceived ease of use is defined as "the degree to which a person believes that using technology will be free from effort" (Davis, 1989, p. 320). Perceived ease of use is one of the most important determinants of technology adoption and has been applied in various technological contexts, including e-service, wireless technology, mobile internet, instant messaging, and mobile commerce (e.g. Chong, 2013). Previous studies have proven that perceived ease of use significantly impacts attitudes and intention towards mobile phones for purchasing secondary airline travel services (Morosan, 2014), customer satisfaction with ecommerce platforms and electronic services (e.g. Liao et al., 2007), and consumers' acceptance of services and mobile commerce (e.g. Chong, 2013;Ozturk, 2016). Tourists must consider collecting various information when planning a trip, such as information about the required travel documents, legal matters, attractions, accommodations, restaurants, public and private transportation, weather conditions, etc. Due to the variety and quantity of the required information, consumers need time to retrieve and process the needed information.Perceived ease of use is defined as "the degree to which a person believes that using technology will be free from effort" (Davis, 1989, p. 320).

        <p>The effectiveness of information systems in retrieving relevant information is positively correlated with user satisfaction (Al-Maskari and Sanderson, 2010). A study on elearning showed that students do not want to spend significant time and effort learning how to use a new system (Saadé and Bahli, 2005). Similarly, consumers aim to reduce the cognitive effort required in searching for information to focus on the content of the reviews. UGC platforms attempt to facilitate consumers' information searches through different technologies. For example, information search functions, filters, and mobile apps allow users to easily and rapidly retrieve the relevant information. Once they learn how to use them, consumers are keener to continue using the platform, as the cognitive effort needed to operate them will be lower. Consistently, we argue that ease of use will affect customers' satisfaction and intention to continue using a UGC platform. Thus, we hypothesize the following: Hypothesis 3a: Perceived ease of use has a positive impact on CS.

        <p>Heuristic information processing implies that individuals "consider a few informational cuesor even a single informational cueand form a judgment based on these cues" (Tam and Ho, 2005, p. 196). The heuristic view of persuasion mentions that the consumer is a cognitive miser; hence, consumers try to process information efficiently to reduce cognitive effort as much as they can (Taylor, 1981). According to this view, consumers rely only on heuristics to reduce mental effort and facilitate judgments (Chen and Chaiken, 1999).Heuristic information processing implies that individuals "consider a few informational cuesor even a single informational cueand form a judgment based on these cues" (Tam and Ho, 2005, p. 196).

        <p>Researchers have analyzed the impact of reviews' numerical ratings on product sales (Chevalier and Mayzlin, 2006;Ye et al., 2011). Scholars have also studied the impact of consumer ratings on information adoption (Filieri and McLeay, 2014), hotel performance (Xie et al., 2014), travelers' attitudes toward the hotel and intentions to book a room (Sparks and Browning, 2011), review helpfulness (e.g. Mudambi and Schuff, 2010;Park and Nicolau, 2015;Filieri et al., 2020) and perceived information diagnosticity (Filieri, 2015;Filieri et al., 2018a). Heuristics can help consumers quickly assess the performance of various products on offer (i.e. accommodation available in a destination) and choose the best value for money option. By saving consumers' time, money, and mental effort, performance heuristics make consumer decisions more efficient and effective, which will lead to a feeling of satisfaction and willingness to reuse the same platform again in the future.

        <p>Customer satisfaction is defined as the general level of satisfaction, which is inferred based on customers' assessments of prior relationships, business activities, or experiences with an organization or with its products and services concerning their needs and expectations (Oliver, 1980). User satisfaction is one of the fundamental elements of the IS Continuance Model (Bhattacherjee, 2001). Bhattacherjee (2001) proved that users who are satisfied with a particular technology would continue using it. Customer satisfaction (CS) arises when a product or service regarding technology performs in a way that satisfies consumers' expectations.Customer satisfaction is defined as the general level of satisfaction, which is inferred based on customers' assessments of prior relationships, business activities, or experiences with an organization or with its products and services concerning their needs and expectations (Oliver, 1980).

        <p>Apart from satisfaction's significant influence on CI, several studies revealed that satisfaction plays a mediating role between the antecedents of CI and CI itself (Chang and Zhu, 2012). For example, Akter et al.'s (2013) study of mobile health shows that satisfaction partially mediates the relationship between perceived usefulness, confirmation, perceived service quality, perceived trust, and continuance intention. Similarly, the findings of a study on bike-sharing apps show that satisfaction partly mediates the relationship between perceived usefulness and satisfaction (Cheng et al., 2019).

        <p>To evaluate the structural model, Hair et al. (2013) propose examining the R 2 , beta value, and identical t values as well as the effect size (f 2 ). First, the main principle for the assessment of the structural model is the values of the variance explained (R 2 ). R 2 value measures the size of the relationship between the latent variables, illustrating how much an exogenous latent variable contributes to an endogenous latent variable (Wong, 2013). Following Cohen's (1988) principle (0.02 = small effect, 0.15 = medium effect, and 0.35 = large effect), the effect size was estimated and presented in Table V (Hair et al., 2014). R 2 values of 0.59 (continuance intention) and 0.71 (customer satisfaction) for the endogenous variables in our model are to be considered moderate and strong, respectively (Chin, 1998).To evaluate the structural model, Hair et al.

In our study, only one of the indirect effects was insignificant, i.e. the path performance heuristics -&gt; customer satisfaction -&gt; continuance intention and the 95% confidence interval covers zero (-0.008-0.059). The other three indirect effects were significant, with a 95% confidence interval, suggesting that CS mediates the effects of ease of use, OCR credibility, and OCR usefulness on CI.The last hypothesis of our study suggested that CS mediates the relationship between the independent variables in our framework and CI. We utilized the bootstrapping method (Zhao et al., 2010). The findings are illustrated in Table VII. Hair et al. (2010) suggest that when the indirect effects are significant, the mediation effect can be established.

        <p>To evaluate the magnitude of mediation, we employed the Variance Accounted For (VAF) (Ali et al., 2018). VAF values change between 0 and 100%. If values are above 80%, they indicate full mediation. If values vary between 20% and 80%, they demonstrate partial mediation. Last, when values are under 20%, they indicate no mediation effect (Merli et al., 2019).

        <p>This study aimed to research the factors influencing users' continuance intention of UGC platforms by focusing on TripAdvisor, the world's largest traveler community. The results of our study reveal that perceived review credibility, review usefulness, and ease of use predict customer satisfaction and intention of continued use of TripAdvisor, with customer satisfaction playing a mediating role. However, contrary to our expectations, performance heuristics neither predicted customer satisfaction nor continuance intention.This study aimed to research the factors influencing users' continuance intention of UGC platforms by focusing on TripAdvisor, the world's largest traveler community.

        <p>Perceived review credibility is one of the most crucial determinants of travelers' satisfaction and continued use of UGC platforms. Previous studies in eWOM measured the effect of review credibility on users' adoption of information (Cheung et al., 2009), while other scholars highlighted the cues consumers use to ferret out fake reviews (Filieri, 2016;Plotkina et al., 2020) or studied the impact of trust towards a UGC platform on users' eWOM and recommendation adoption (Filieri et al., 2015). In general, the growing importance of review credibility is probably due to the growing media attention to the alarming phenomena of fake and promotional reviews (Filieri, 2016;Chakraborty, 2019). This study reveals that the more consumers obtain credible information from online reviews on TripAdvisor, the higher their satisfaction and intention to continue using this platform will be. Perceived review credibility is particularly important in the decision-making of travel-related products.Perceived review credibility is one of the most crucial determinants of travelers' satisfaction and continued use of UGC platforms.

        <p>Perceived review usefulness is another significant determinant of customer satisfaction and continuance intention of UGC platforms. That is, if travelers feel that recommendations and reviews are helpful to assess products' quality and performance before purchasing them, they will be satisfied and will continue using the same platform. Our results underline the importance of perceived usefulness as a significant predictor of customer satisfaction with various technologies (e.g. blogs, social media, online shopping, websites, eservices, and digital textbooks) (Bhattacherjee, 2001;Kang and Lee, 2010;Joo et al., 2017;Lin et al., 2005). Furthermore, it proves its direct influence on users' continuance intention (e.g. Al-Maghrabi et al., 2011;Bhattacherjee, 2001;Joo et al., 2017;Liao et al., 2007;Lin and Lu, 2000;Mouakket, 2015;Tang et al., 2014).Perceived review usefulness is another significant determinant of customer satisfaction and continuance intention of UGC platforms.

        <p>Our findings demonstrate that the perceived ease of use of TripAdvisor has a positive impact on customer satisfaction and continuance intention. Although prior studies found that perceived ease of use has a weak or absent effect on attitude in the later stages of technology adoption (Davis et al., 1989;Karahanna et al., 1999;Liao et al., 2007), perceived ease of use is a strong and significant antecedent of customer satisfaction in this study. This is consistent with technology adoption studies that found that perceived ease of use is positively related to the adoption of technologies such as mobile commerce (Chong, 2013) and with research on consumers' loyalty towards mobile hotel booking (Ozturk et al., 2016b).Our findings demonstrate that the perceived ease of use of TripAdvisor has a positive impact on customer satisfaction and continuance intention.

        <p>Performance heuristics provide visual information about the overall level of satisfaction (average evaluation) as expressed by all travelers who have rated a tourism service. Contrary to our expectations, the effect of performance heuristics was not significant on either customer satisfaction or continuance intention. This result can be explained by different reasons. From a theoretical perspective, holiday booking implies a high involvement in information processing (Smallman and Moore, 2010;Filieri et al., 2018a). Hence, travelers may prefer to use the central route of information processing and attentively evaluate the arguments in consumer reviews (Petty et al., 1983). From a technological perspective, TripAdvisor's performance heuristics (i.e. 5-bubbles rating scale) do not provide much discrimination between the various options available to travelers. Similarly, scholars found most reviews posted on TripAdvisor are positive; hence, the rating distribution is skewed towards the positive end of the scale (Park and Nicolau, 2015). In marketing research, it is agreed that more scale points in a survey provide more options for the research participant (Dawes, 2008). Due to the reasons mentioned above, the use of decimals in rating scales is supposed to improve consumers' evaluation and discrimination between the various options available. Many eWOM and e-commerce platforms already display decimals in their rating scales (i.e. Google Reviews, Booking.com, Airbnb.com). In conclusion, it is plausible that the similarity of rating scores makes it difficult for consumers to discriminate among the different options available.Performance heuristics provide visual information about the overall level of satisfaction (average evaluation) as expressed by all travelers who have rated a tourism service.

        <p>Customer satisfaction is a key predictor of continuance intention in the context of UGC platforms. This finding confirms prior research findings on different technologies such as online banking, blogging, social networking sites, Web 2.0, mobile commerce (e.g. Bhattacherjee, 2001;Chang and Zhu, 2012;Chen et al., 2012;Gao et al., 2015;Mouakket, 2015;Tang et al., 2014). Furthermore, customer satisfaction mediates the effect of the independent variables in our model (OCR usefulness, OCR credibility, perceived ease of use) and continuance intention, confirming recent research findings on bike-sharing apps (Cheng et al., 2019).Customer satisfaction is a key predictor of continuance intention in the context of UGC platforms.

        <p>We started this paper by highlighting the lack of research on technology continuance intention in the travel and tourism context. Prior research examined the factors influencing travelers' continuance intention of mobile apps (Ozturk et al., 2016a;Kang and Namkung, 2019), the effect of users' offline activities on continued use of online travel communities (Ukpabi et al., 2019), and guests' continued use of the hotel's social media pages (Jung et al., 2018). Building on the IS/IT Continuance Model (Bhattacherjee, 2001) and TAM (Davis, 1989), this study developed and tested an integrated theoretical framework of consumers' continuance intention of UGC platforms.We started this paper by highlighting the lack of research on technology continuance intention in the travel and tourism context.

        <p>In addition, we extended these models by including new constructs that are particularly important in the eWOM context, such as perceived review credibility, perceived review usefulness, and performance heuristics (e.g. Chakraborty, 2019;Cheung et al., 2008Cheung et al., , 2009;;Filieri, 2016;Filieri and McLeay, 2014;Park and Nicolau, 2015;Ye et al., 2011). A further theoretical contribution of this study is that, for the first time, the IS Continuance Model (Bhattacherjee, 2001) is adopted in the travel and tourism research context and, specifically, to study continuance intention of travel-based UGC platforms. The tested model explained a good percentage of the variance of the dependent variables, making our model promising for use in future studies to explain satisfaction with travel-related technologies and continued use over time.In addition, we extended these models by including new constructs that are particularly important in the eWOM context, such as perceived review credibility, perceived review usefulness, and performance heuristics (e.g. Chakraborty, 2019;Cheung et al., 2008Cheung et al., , 2009;;Filieri, 2016;Filieri and McLeay, 2014;Park and Nicolau, 2015;Ye et al., 2011).

        <p>The findings are relevant for digital marketing managers of UGC platforms as they show the variables that influence travelers' continuance intention. First, managers of UGC platforms should improve travelers' information search experience by facilitating the platform's ease of use. For instance, 
            <rs type="software">Google Maps</rs> and 
            <rs type="software">Google Reviews</rs> have constantly seen growth in the number of users (Singh, 2019). The accessibility (one of the components of ease of use) of Google Reviews is better than 
            <rs type="software">TripAdvisor</rs>'s. While 
            <rs type="software">TripAdvisor</rs> reviews remain an important information source about tourism packages, many people are increasingly looking for alternative platforms that are easy to use and contain geo-localized information (Tussyadiah and Zach, 2012). Moreover, 
            <rs type="software">TripAdvisor</rs> should not only facilitate the retrieval of information but also the retrieval of the most credible and useful OCRs. For example, some travelers decide to book accommodations and restaurants based on specific service quality attributes (Filieri et al., 2020). Hence, these users may be more interested in, and vote as more helpful, the reviews that discuss these attributes (Filieri et al., 2020). At present, many UGC platforms, including 
            <rs type="software">TripAdvisor</rs>, enable users to view OCRs only in chronological order and in an aggregate fashion. However, to improve ease of use, UGC platforms should enhance the retrieval of consumer reviews according to the different dimensions of tourism services that are important to different consumers (e.g. breakfast quality, cleanliness, bed comfort for accommodation). UGC platforms like 
            <rs type="software">TripAdvisor</rs> should enable travelers to rapidly retrieve the most useful reviews about the service quality criteria that are most important to them. By doing so, UGC platforms can reduce information overload issues and enhance customer satisfaction and continuance intention.
        </p>
        <p>Perceived review credibility has a significant effect on customer satisfaction and continuance intention (through the mediation of satisfaction). The rise of promotional and fake reviews is a clear warning to UGC platforms. In this end, TripAdvisor has received a lot of negative publicity for not being able to prevent fake reviews from being published on the website. For example, the news of a nonexistent restaurant, 'The Shed at Dulwich,' that received so many complimentary reviews to become the top-rated restaurant in London, attracted mass media attention across the globe (Butler, 2017). Travelers view UGC platforms as independent travel guides where they can retrieve honest feedback and experiences from real travelers. Managers of UGC platforms should ensure the credibility of the reviews by adopting some identity check mechanisms. Moreover, TripAdvisor should be more proactive in communicating about the actions they undertake to fight the diffusion of fake and promotional reviews. In such a way, its management could minimize the impact of news about fake reviews, which are tarnishing the platform's reputation. On the other hand, TripAdvisor could incentivize and give more visibility to the reviews that are perceived as most credible by travelers and introduce a credibility vote in addition to the helpful vote.Perceived review credibility has a significant effect on customer satisfaction and continuance intention (through the mediation of satisfaction).

        <p>This research is not exempted from limitations. First, the respondents were mostly European users aged 18-35 years old and recruited through Prolific. Although research on technology continuance intention in European countries is scant, it would be advisable to replicate this study with participants from other countries and different age groups to generalize the findings. Accordingly, cultural differences are important in consumers' information processing (Leon, 2019).This research is not exempted from limitations.

        <p>Moreover, the current research only covers the users of 
            <rs type="software">TripAdvisor</rs>. Other studies could focus on other eWOM platforms such as Google Reviews, which have been indicated to be the first information source that people go to get consumer reviews about products (Forrest, 2017). Furthermore, scholars could investigate the factors affecting continuance intention of other eWOM formats, such as video (i.e. travel videos), graphic (i.e. travelers' photos on Instagram), or other mixed (i.e. travel blogs).
        </p>
        <p>Future research could use the IS/IT continuance intention model to investigate a variety of interesting phenomena, such as continuance intention of travel books, travel applications, and of accommodation's self-service check-in and check-out systems. Scholars could investigate the continuance intention of specific behaviors, not only technology. For example, they could focus on the behavior of posting consumer reviews, which could be undeniably interesting for managers of social commerce, UGC platforms, and online travel communities. Accordingly, these organizations constantly attempt to understand how to motivate customers and prospects to post reviews on their platforms.Future research could use the IS/IT continuance intention model to investigate a variety of interesting phenomena, such as continuance intention of travel books, travel applications, and of accommodation's self-service check-in and check-out systems.

        <p>Moreover, the construct of consumer engagement with brands on social media is gaining importance in the marketing literature. The application of the IS Continuance Model could be useful to understand consumers' motivation to continue to engage with online travel brand communities on social media platforms. Finally, this study has focused on technology continuance intention. Scholars could instead investigate the factors leading to discontinuance intention of UGC platforms, i.e. the cessation of the use of technology.Moreover, the construct of consumer engagement with brands on social media is gaining importance in the marketing literature.
