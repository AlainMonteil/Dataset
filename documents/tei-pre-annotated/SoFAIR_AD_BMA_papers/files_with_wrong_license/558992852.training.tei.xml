        <p>This paper seeks to present the first systematic literature review (SLR) on biodiversity and species extinction accounting publications. This strand of research is gaining increased attention due to emerging scientific evidence that finds a relationship between the human destruction of biodiversity and the recent Covid-19 crisis, causing profound economic and health impacts. This justifies the need for an SLR of forty articles from 2013-2020. Descriptive results show research contributions peaked in 2018 with the most publications appearing in the Auditing, Accounting &amp; Accountability Journal. Results show legitimacy theory is the most applied theoretical framework with global studies and developed country specific research receiving the greatest attention. In addition, content analysis is identified as the preferred research methodology. Additionally, through synthesising and analysing literature, we provide potential opportunities for future research that is underexplored. This paper will provide a valuable study for academics, policymakers, and practitioners pursuing research in this field.This paper seeks to present the first systematic literature review (SLR) on biodiversity and species extinction accounting publications.

        <p>One of the greatest threats to the planet is further biodiversity loss and species extinction.One of the greatest threats to the planet is further biodiversity loss and species extinction.</p>
        <p>Scientific research believes the planet has entered the sixth mass extinction event, with human activity the main driver (Adler et al., 2018;Maroun and Atkins, 2018). Experts estimate up to one million plant and animal species face extinction within decades (IPBES, 2019) if transformational changes are not made. For the last decade, corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting has been dominant in organisations reporting strategy. Now, within the wider environmental challenges, biodiversity and extinction (hereafter B/E) accounting, is regarded as an extension of CSR reporting. B/E is an emerging stream of literature and in its infancy (Jones and Solomon, 2013;Gaia and Jones, 2017;Haque and Jones, 2020). To date, extant literature provides insights into the complex relationship between global organisations and nature as they have a moral duty to responsibly conserve and protect biodiversity that underpins societal existence (Gaia and Jones, 2019). We contribute to this existing knowledge by providing, what we believe is the first systematic literature review (hereafter SLR) in this emerging stream of B/E literature.Scientific research believes the planet has entered the sixth mass extinction event, with human activity the main driver (Adler et al., 2018;Maroun and Atkins, 2018).

        <p>We justify the contribution of this SLR on B/E accounting for several reasons. Firstly, in 2020, The World Economic Forum recognised biodiversity loss as one of the top five global risks to society, which demonstrates the urgency of this research field. Secondly, The United Nations' Sustainability Development Goals (SDG's), specifically SDG-14 Life below water, and SDG-15 Life on land are the most recent international call for action to address the crisis which interconnects to the wider environmental, societal, and economic sustainability (UN, 2020). These goals are intended to help organisations align with the targets of sustainable development (Mio et al., 2020;Sobkowiak et al., 2020) and prevent resources of natural capital from further decline. In addition, given the current Covid-19 crisis, new cutting-edge research is urgently required to examine organisational responsibility towards B/E (Reade et al., 2015) as experts argue human encroachment with nature originates, and may trigger further global zoonotic pandemics (Ceballos et al., 2020;World Health Organization, 2020). Evidence suggests pandemics are a result of biodiversity loss and habitat destructions (Hassan et al., 2020b;UN, 2020), as proximity contact with humans and wildlife increases zoonotic disease transmission (Johnson et al., 2020). As a result, we expect organisations to, consciously, make tremendous efforts in conserving nature. Furthermore, we expect researchers from interdisciplinary fields to focus on this embryonic stream of literature.We justify the contribution of this SLR on B/E accounting for several reasons.

        <p>Based on this discussion, we perceive this SLR to be crucial in this research area, thus providing a resourceful foundation for future academics.Based on this discussion, we perceive this SLR to be crucial in this research area, thus providing a resourceful foundation for future academics.</p>
        <p>Despite the growing interest of accounting academia in environmental research such as climate change (Bryant et al., 2019), carbon accounting (Alsaifi et al., 2019), and wider environmental issues (Elmagrhi et al., 2018) there is little consideration from scholars on exploring organisational responsibility for the B/E crisis (Cuckston, 2013;Jones and Solomon, 2013;Atkins and Maroun, 2018). Early literature provokes researchers to provide contributions (Jones and Solomon, 2013) and raise awareness on how organisations are engaging in 'stewardship' of biodiversity. In response, empirical studies emerge, and biodiversity accounting research extends to include the 'extinction' element due to the severity of the decline of nature (Atkins and Maroun, 2018). The challenge on how to address the global impact to the natural environment is debated in the literature (Addison et al., 2019;Haque and Jones, 2020) with research contributions of organisational accountability in both corporate (Rimmel and Jon√§ll, 2013;Adler et al., 2018, Hassan et al., 2020a) and public sectors (Weir, 2018;Gaia and Jones, 2019). Scholars argue B/E accounting is a vital topic with extensive studies focusing on disclosure from annual reports providing a qualitative analysis (Atkins et al., 2018a;Maroun and Atkins, 2018;Weir, 2018), as well as quantitative analysis by examining the relationship of determinant factors and company disclosure (Bhattacharyya and Yang, 2019;Haque and Jones, 2020;Hassan et al., 2020a). Also, further tranches provide calculability mechanisms for biodiversity conservation performance are offered (Cuckston 2013(Cuckston , 2018b;;Sobkowiak et al., 2020). A strand of literature argues that the widely adopted Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards are inadequate in addressing the decline in nature (Jones and Solomon, 2013;Boiral, 2016;Gray and Milne, 2018;Smith et al., 2019). Scholars also offer a wave of insightful solutions for addressing biodiversity loss and indeed further species extinction in the form of frameworks (Adler et al., 2018;Atkins et al., 2018a, Hassan et al., 2020a).Despite the growing interest of accounting academia in environmental research such as climate change (Bryant et al., 2019), carbon accounting (Alsaifi et al., 2019), and wider environmental issues (Elmagrhi et al., 2018) there is little consideration from scholars on exploring organisational responsibility for the B/E crisis (Cuckston, 2013;Jones and Solomon, 2013;Atkins and Maroun, 2018).

        <p>Based on presenting the above justifications, our main aim and motivation is to synthesise and descriptively analyse current research and identify key areas and opportunities of potential research for academics. Our aim is to provide a systematic in-depth overview of existing literature on B/E accounting. Due to the pressing environmental uncertainties, this substantiates the significance of this SLR and contributes to the current body of literature.Based on presenting the above justifications, our main aim and motivation is to synthesise and descriptively analyse current research and identify key areas and opportunities of potential research for academics.

        <p>Wider environmental degradation issues, including global warming and climate change are inextricably linked to B/E; therefore, it is imperative researchers must seek to understand the relationship between organisations and nature. In addition, we aim to provide an evaluation of the way research has been conducted in this field, and to identify patterns and trends (Agudelo et al., 2020;Khan et al., 2020), which will enable us to outline potential opportunities for future research.Wider environmental degradation issues, including global warming and climate change are inextricably linked to B/E; therefore, it is imperative researchers must seek to understand the relationship between organisations and nature.

        <p>Essentially, we expect to make several contributions to existing literature. First, we believe to our knowledge, or at least, no evidence exists that there is an SLR offered in this strand, or indeed the wider CSR, or social and environmental reporting (SER) literature, on B/E accounting. Therefore, we present the first SLR on B/E accounting. Secondly, we synthesise and classify publications to analyse by journal, year, country, research methods, and theoretical framework. Thus, enabling us to provide opportunities for future research which are important in establishing a sustainable future. Lastly, as a unique contribution, we provide a table including all relevant research for future researchers with publication specific information, including year, methodology, theoretical framework, and country information (see appendix 1). Thus, our SLR contributes to the current research on B/E accounting by generally mapping out why (theories), how (methodological approaches), and what (empirical evidence) we know in this field. This offers an invaluable starting point for future researchers to progress with research and additionally provides an opportunity to extend as further literature emerges.Essentially, we expect to make several contributions to existing literature.

        <p>According to Fink (2005, p.3), the SLR is "a systematic, explicit, comprehensive, and reproducible method for identifying, evaluating, and synthesising the existing body of completed and recorded work produced by researchers, scholars, and practitioners". An SLR can be described as an evidence-based selection of the most relevant data (Rafi-Ul-Shan et al., 2018) with the aim to provide a summary of knowledge and an understanding of the topic's development and highlight research gaps (Khan et al., 2020) (Ali et al., 2017).According to Fink (2005, p.3), the SLR is "a systematic, explicit, comprehensive, and reproducible method for identifying, evaluating, and synthesising the existing body of completed and recorded work produced by researchers, scholars, and practitioners".

        <p>Research depends on shared knowledge from a range of disciplines such as ecology, science, accounting, and other experts to collaborate and develop solutions (Hassan et al., 2020a). As a response from the accounting profession about this vital area, the main source for papers comes from The Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal (AAAJ), which has published 19 articles (see Table 1) on B/E. This includes publications from the 2018 special issue "Extinction accounting and accountability", and the 2013 special issue "Accounting for biodiversity". The AAAJ is the most influential journal that has led the way in paving interest from scholars in this embryonic research topic. Other journals have published only one or two papers contributing to the literature. In total, 28 journal publications were identified that met the inclusion criteria. The remaining journal distribution is presented in Table 1.Research depends on shared knowledge from a range of disciplines such as ecology, science, accounting, and other experts to collaborate and develop solutions (Hassan et al., 2020a).

        <p>While a book entitled "Chief Value Officer" (King and Atkins, 2016) presents a new approach from the role of a traditional 'Chief Financial Officer' to a 'Chief Value Officer', thus the idea of companies being led to create value in responsible sustainable governance in saving the planet. Another book entitled "Around the World in 80 Species" (Atkins and Atkins, 2018), which presents an understanding of extinction accounting and the business perspective, providing chapters from guest academic authors exploring B/E accountability studies from around the world. These credible academic scholars have published articles within accounting academia. Although the chapters are short, they provide insightful information on the topic and provide additional analysis to the literature, which is scarce in research papers. These book chapters present the second largest source of literature for the SLR. These books provided a total of ten chapters which met the inclusion criteria.

        <p>Firstly, the articles are classified by their frequency of publication. This is to examine if the topic is gaining attention in academia. Second, we categorise by geographical spread, firstly by country, and refine into a developed or developing country. Third, as the majority of studies are empirical, we examine research methods. Furthermore, the selected publications are classified into their theoretical focus. Finally, the review analyses the main research limitations within the literature and outline potential future research in this emerging field.Firstly, the articles are classified by their frequency of publication.

        <p>The distribution of articles published by year is shown in Figure 2. Analysis reveals that research peaked in 2018 with seventeen publications. This coincides with the special edition from AAAJ and the book contribution from Atkins and Atkins (2018). The second highest year of publications is 2013 with a further eight contributions which correspond with the AAAJ special edition. The year 2019 provides five research publications and there are three publications in the first half of 2020. It is expected there will be a rise in publications due to experts arguing that human encroachment with nature is linked to the spillover of zoonotic diseases that have led to pandemics such as the recent Covid-19 (Ceballos et al., 2020).The distribution of articles published by year is shown in Figure 2.

        <p>According to Figure 3, eight publications investigate organisations globally for their disclosure on B/E (Bhattacharya and Managi, 2013;Boiral, 2016;Boiral and Heras-Saizarbitoria, 2017;Adler et al., 2018;Addison et al., 2019;Skouloudis et al., 2019;Hassan et al., 2020a). This is followed by six UK specific studies (Freeman and Groom, 2013;Gaia andJones, 2017, 2019;Weir, 2018Weir, , 2019)). Research from South Africa warranted three studies (Atkins et al., 2018a;Buchling and Maroun, 2018;Maroun and Atkins, 2018), and two studies each from New Zealand (Tregidga, 2013;Samkin et al., 2014), Australia (Adler et al., 2017;Bhattacharyya and Yang, 2019), Kenya (Cuckston, 2013;Sibanda and Mulama, 2018), and European studies (Rimmel, 2018: Haque andJones, 2020). Countries such as Denmark (van Liempd and Busch, 2013), Sweden (Rimmel and Jon√§ll, 2013), Bangladesh (Siddiqui, 2013), China (Zhao and Atkins, 2018), Italy (Martini et al., 2018), the Arctic region (Jon√§ll and Sabelfeld, 2018), and a combined study of the UK and Germany (Atkins et al., 2014) and the USA and Canada (Solomon and Clappison, 2018) were studied once.According to Figure 3, eight publications investigate organisations globally for their disclosure on B/E (Bhattacharya and Managi, 2013;Boiral, 2016;Boiral and Heras-Saizarbitoria, 2017;Adler et al., 2018;Addison et al., 2019;Skouloudis et al., 2019;Hassan et al., 2020a).

Zhao and Atkins (2018) test an extinction accounting framework on the giant panda in China. On analysing reports from Chinese listed companies, panda conservation was absent. However, further research into non-government organisations (NGOs) documented more encouraging results with evidence of partnering with listed companies.

        <p>Global studies on organisations emerge with contribution from Adler et al., (2018) focusing on companies from the Fortune Global list. Consistent with prior literature, few companies are providing substantial reporting. Empirically, results reveal that 91.8% of the sample did not disclose on the loss of biodiversity or species due to its operations. This outcome reflects the real issue companies have in understanding the immense global challenge. The authors seek explanation through legitimacy theory, suggesting companies remain driven by anthropocentric reporting rather than displaying a genuine concern for nature by deep ecology, a theory applied by prior research of Samkin et al. (2014) and Atkins et al. (2018a).Global studies on organisations emerge with contribution from Adler et al., (2018) focusing on companies from the Fortune Global list.

        <p>Encouragingly, Addison et al.

        <p>Theoretically, the authors support findings that impression management and greenwashing strategies underpin corporate disclosure. An array of literature argues that companies are found to be indulging in impression management by providing symbolic commitments to stakeholders (Solomon et al., 2013;Atkins et al., 2014;Boiral 2016), however, another justification may be companies lack awareness on the issue.Theoretically, the authors support findings that impression management and greenwashing strategies underpin corporate disclosure.

        <p>This section analyses publications by research methods. Figure 5 shows that most prior empirical studies (24) use the content analysis method. Organisations communicate B/E information through websites, and CSR, environmental, sustainability or, integrated reporting formats (Adler et al., 2018;Bhattacharyya and Yang, 2019). The widespread use of such reporting formats explains the favourable content analysis method. These findings support prior CSR literature review studies (Fifka, 2013;Ali et al., 2017, Khan et al., 2020) who evidence extensive use of content analysis. Only a few studies apply mixed methods, combining interviews with content analysis, and semi-structured interviews.This section analyses publications by research methods.

        <p>Contributions from authors using content analysis (Atkins et al., 2014;Maroun and Atkins, 2018;Addison et al., 2019;Bhattacharyya and Yang, 2019) search annual reports for disclosure on B/E. Authors use keywords to capture all relevant data as well as manual collections (Adler et al., 2017(Adler et al., , 2018;;Hassan et al., 2020a). Although content analysis is widely used, there are some limitations to this application. If keywords or specific phrases only are of interest there is a risk of missing more substantial data that may allow you to understand the phenomena (Collis and Hussey, 2014). In the instance of examining organisational published secondary data, there is risk information may be provided for impression management (Atkins et al., 2014). Boiral (2016) mentions that information provided in sustainability reporting can be bias and questions the reliability of the information.Contributions from authors using content analysis (Atkins et al., 2014;Maroun and Atkins, 2018;Addison et al., 2019;Bhattacharyya and Yang, 2019) search annual reports for disclosure on B/E.

        <p>The majority of content analysis research is dominated by providing qualitative analysis through the collection of data from documents (and in some cases websites). Methods include the categorisation of information through reporting of GRI disclosure (Boiral and Heras-Saizarbitoria, 2017), identification of themes and patterns through text units (Samkin et al., 2014), and interpretive text analysis (Atkins et al., 2018a). Within these studies, researchers applied deep ecology and stakeholder theoretical perspectives to understand motivations.The majority of content analysis research is dominated by providing qualitative analysis through the collection of data from documents (and in some cases websites).

        <p>Practically, the ease of access to organisations reports through websites can explain the frequent use (Khan et al., 2020).

        <p>It is observed that fewer studies analyse content analysis quantitively, which is a limitation in literature. Empirical contributions that provide quantitative analysis focus on examining relationships between disclosure on B/E and several determinant factors. Positive relations emerge in literature through the application of regression analysis with, for example; wildlife partnership engagement (Adler et al., 2018;Hassan et al., 2020a), media attention, board independence, and size, (Bhattacharyya and Yang, 2019), board gender (Haque and Jones, 2020), environmental awards, assurance, and developing countries (Hassan et al., 2020a), and local council specific information (Gaia and Jones, 2019). The relationship between disclosure and industry sector conflicts, with some scholars finding a positive association with high intensive industries (Bhattacharyya and Yang, 2019;Skouloudis et al., 2019;Haque and Jones, 2020;Hassan et al., 2020a), however, a study by Addison et al., (2019) challenges this, suggesting that industry impact on biodiversity is not the sole driver for disclosure. Therefore, this area would benefit from further research. Theoretically, impression management explains high impact sectors provide more information (Atkins et al., 2014, Hassan et al., 2020a) and showcase "good news" and obfuscate negative information (Solomon et al., 2013).It is observed that fewer studies analyse content analysis quantitively, which is a limitation in literature.

        <p>A more robust methodology is presented with a mixed-methods investigation in four publications. In each paper, content analysis is followed by interviews with managers strengthening reliability and validate results combining both primary and secondary data information. For example, Rimmel and Jon√§ll (2013) find that biodiversity disclosures from Swedish companies are low; however disclosure increases in their longitudinal study. They validate their findings by conducting interviews, with respondents offering support that due to increased pressure for sustainability reporting, this justifies the increase in disclosure.A more robust methodology is presented with a mixed-methods investigation in four publications.

        <p>Further studies provide literature, theoretical and essay publications. Notable contributions come from Jones and Solomon (2013) who argue that biodiversity reporting and accountability must evolve to address the biodiversity crisis and Atkins and Maroun (2018) who provide the first glimpse of extinction accounting frameworks. King and Atkins (2016) view this framework as a revolutionary reporting format entwined in integrated reporting, and if companies do not comply, they will not be seen as good corporate citizens. Gray and Milne (2018) reflect species extinction is humankind's drive of capitalism, profit, and the pursuit of more. They suggest that the planet is at crisis point, and if humans do not recognise the earth is at a crossroad, human extinction cannot be unthinkable. Bebbington and Unerman (2018) discuss the implementation of the SDGs and they found companies have integrated some SDG's into sustainability reports or GRI index.Further studies provide literature, theoretical and essay publications.

        <p>B/E accounting is mainly analysed through theories commonly utilised in SER literature (Daddi et al., 2018). Legitimacy theory is the most widely applied theory to B/E studies (see Figure 6). This is expected as legitimacy theory is well established in SER research (Cho and Patten, 2007;Chauvey et al., 2015;Bhattacharyya and Yang, 2019). It is widely argued in B/E literature that companies are rife in disclosing information to gain legitimacy (Rimmel and Jon√§ll, 2013;Adler et al., 2017;Bhattacharyya and Yang, 2019). Legitimacy theory which originates from Suchman (1995) offers support for empirical findings that as all organisations impact nature directly or indirectly, and disclosure is presented to meet societal demands and expectations (Patten, 2002;Cho and Patten, 2007;Cho et al., 2015;Adler et al., 2018). Legitimacy, stakeholder, resource dependency and, institutional theories share a similar ontological view (Chen and Robert, 2010) assuming organisations are influenced by society and vice versa (Gray, 2010: Bhattacharyya, 2014).B/E accounting is mainly analysed through theories commonly utilised in SER literature (Daddi et al., 2018).

        <p>Extant literature finds B/E reporting increases due to external pressures on how to manage environmental events (Rimmel and Jon√§ll, 2013). Legitimacy and impression management are similar in their attempt to increase societal perception, maintain the reputation and, receive greater confidence from stakeholders (Deegan, 2002;Clarkson et al., 2008;Patten, 2015). Goffman's impression management similarly contributes to B/E literature (Solomon et al., 2013;Boiral, 2016;Adler et al., 2018). Prior studies find disclosure is used merely to display good corporate citizenship (Adler et al., 2018), and maintain corporate image (Boiral, 2016). Empirical studies use impression management to explain results and consider companies to be indulging in manipulation by expressing positive performance and omitting negative impacts (Jones and Solomon, 2013;Hassan et al., 2020a). Other SER relevant theories applied in literature are stakeholder (Boiral and Heras-Saizarbitoria, 2017;Gaia and Jones, 2017) and institutional (Gaia and Jones, 2019;Weir, 2019) theories. Although stakeholder theory is applied in empirical studies (Boiral and Heras-Saizarbitoria, 2017;Gaia &amp; Jones, 2019), so far, there is a failure to view species as stakeholders of the wider community. The overwhelming evidence of their fundamental value to business survival explicitly arguably pieces of evidence species are main stakeholders in society. This approach in stakeholder theory would indeed encourage organisations to disclosure accountability on impact and protection to species, ultimately responding to the extinction crisis and provides a theoretical application for future research.Extant literature finds B/E reporting increases due to external pressures on how to manage environmental events (Rimmel and Jon√§ll, 2013).

        <p>Deep ecology emerges in three studies (Samkin et al., 2014;Maroun and Atkins, 2018;Christian, 2018). To address the ecological challenges facing society and achieve SDG-14 &amp; 15 (Bebbington and Larrinaga, 2014;Sobkowiak et al., 2020), organisations must align with an eco-centric approach to harmonise with nature. Deep ecology philosophy observes all species should be preserved (Naess, 1989;2008), rejecting anthropocentric shallow ecology, which places humans of hierarchical importance with nature only having value because of what it can contribute to human satisfaction (Thompson and Barton, 1994;Jones, 2004;Jones and Solomon, 2013). Deep ecology theory was established in 1972 by Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess. His approach of environmental defence is to adopt a belief that humans are not the central perspective; human life lies in harmony with nature. This philosophy identifies the fundamental value of biodiversity. Deep ecology philosophy appreciates the intrinsic value of all beings (Naess, 2008) with the intention of self-awareness to improve ecology rather than self-destruct. The opposite of anthropocentric, deep ecology follows the theory of equalness between species (Jones, 2004;Christian, 2018). Literature applying deep ecological framework (Maroun and Atkins, 2018) discovers genuine concern for species is emerging in organisational disclosure. Samkin et al., (2014) find adopting a deep ecological from an anthropocentric perspective in a business is a long-term commitment and may be difficult but should not put them off. Indeed, pure deep ecology would reject any use of natural capital to satisfy humans (Atkins et al., 2014). However, given the looming disaster faced, embedding a form of deep ecological culture in organisations must now be rooted for a sustainable future.Deep ecology emerges in three studies (Samkin et al., 2014;Maroun and Atkins, 2018;Christian, 2018).

We provide a discussion on the common limitations in extant literature (see Table 3) as they can provide direction for future research (Brutus et al., 2013). We expect a high number of contributions in the coming years, as experts believe pandemics such as Covid-19 are a result of human's destruction of biodiversity and illegal wildlife trafficking (Ceballos et al., 2020).

(2018) study only three companies from one industry in Italy, Jon√§ll and Sabelfeld (2018) investigate only two companies from a high biodiversity intensive industry. Although these short chapters provide insightful snapshots of corporate accountability for B/E this may not reflect the overall practice of country/industry selected (Khan et al., 2020). Similarly, in journal publications, some sample selections are considered insufficient (Adler et al., 2018;Addison et al., 2019).

        <p>(2018a) investigated only 41 companies in South Africa. However, the authors recognise this limitation and recommend further research in other jurisdictions to explain the response to extinction. As a result, we would expect future B/E studies to consider larger data samples to improve the validity and robustness of findings which would enhance current literature and challenge or support seminal B/E literature.(2018a) investigated only 41 companies in South Africa.

        <p>We note a large proportion of contributions are limited to a specific industry or one governmental, institutional study. For example, higher impact biodiversity industry studies warrant attention (Adler et al., 2017;Boiral and Heras-Saizarbitoria, 2017). Likewise, single government settings provide insights into B/E accounting (Samkin et al., 2014;Weir, 2018).We note a large proportion of contributions are limited to a specific industry or one governmental, institutional study.

        <p>Gaia and Jones (2019) investigate one institutional setting in the UK, self-proclaiming their results can generalise other developed countries; however further research in a developing country institutional setting would provide a more comprehensive contribution.

        <p>Empirical evidence finds organisations in high-risk sectors disclose more B/E information than those in low-risk sectors (Skouloudis et al., 2019;Hassan et al., 2020a).

        <p>Furthermore, researchers argue organisations reporting through the GRI format is insufficient and inadequate in addressing the B/E crisis (Jones and Solomon, 2013;Boiral, 2016;Gray and Milne, 2018). Alternative reporting frameworks emerge in the literature (Adler et al., 2018;Atkins et al., 2018a, Hassan et al., 2020a) that exceeds the GRI framework, incorporating a wide range of B/E and species-specific indicators. Adopting these frameworks provides an excellent opportunity to investigate a wide scope of organisations in industry, country or, institutional setting and is widely encouraged by the authors.Furthermore, researchers argue organisations reporting through the GRI format is insufficient and inadequate in addressing the B/E crisis (Jones and Solomon, 2013;Boiral, 2016;Gray and Milne, 2018).

        <p>Thus, providing an opportunity for further research on organisations from developing countries. The research argues as organisations expand globally in developed countries, the focus of developing countries research is slight (Hopper et al., 2017;Khan et al., 2020). We strongly encourage further research in this context as illegal wildlife trade and wet markets of developing countries could potentially contribute to further pandemics (Vidal, 2020). Further, some developing countries possess some of the world's richest biodiversity; therefore, research to understand how conserving biodiversity and species protection in these countries may provide. As a result, we would expect more research in the near future to investigate organisations from developing countries, or to compare organisations from both developing and developed countries to further enrich B/E literature.Thus, providing an opportunity for further research on organisations from developing countries.

        <p>Limitations in this method include the dependence of one source of data, e.g. CSR reports and websites. Literature extensively argues that statements provided by organisations can be biased and used for impression management (Solomon et al., 2013;Boiral and Heras-Saizarbitoria, 2017). In essence, companies provide rhetoric on what stakeholders would like to hear, rather than transparent, sincere reporting. For example, Jonall and Sablefeld (2018) find companies are using linguistic strategies to disclose their impact on polar bears. Organisations provide optimistic language and dramatise positive engagement which is a smokescreen, rather than a transparent account of actual impact (Boiral, 2016). Researchers identify the use of one data point may indeed limit the data they collect, for example, Gaia and Jones (2019) acknowledge further information may be available on additional organisational documents such as letters and emails not investigated. Likewise, when investigating websites for content analysis, it is uncertain when information is updated (Adler et al., 2018). Opportunities for future research include a more robust approach by a collection of data from multiple sources such as websites, stand-alone reports, social media, and other documents should be studied as several sources may present a more comprehensive picture of organisations' efforts in B/E accounting, thus, increasing reliability (Piekkari et al., 2009;Fifka, 2013). New technology can advance and support conservation efforts with the help of drones or satellite tracking in assessing inaccessible areas (Palmer, 2018). Investigating if organisations implement technology to inform decision-makers is a new dimension that researchers may want to explore.Limitations in this method include the dependence of one source of data, e.g. CSR reports and websites.

        <p>The main limitation in current research is the dependency and reliability of secondary data. In our methodology analysis, we identified only three publications that provide interviews and only four publications provide mixed (content analysis and interviews) research methods.The main limitation in current research is the dependency and reliability of secondary data.

        <p>In this vein, we recognise the vital need for primary data analysis. We believe that this offers opportunities for future research to provide evidence that content analysis cannot capture (Ali et al., 2017) and explain organsaitons motivations, views, and beliefs towards the B/E crisis (Atkins et al., 2018b). Conducting interviews encourages discussion, raises awareness, and reveals information not publically reported (Khan et al., 2020). Additionally, interviews with board members, executives and shareholders (Haque and Jones, 2020) provides an opportunity to examine if organisations are aligning with SDG-14 &amp; 15 and if their future strategy includes protecting and conserving species, which may identify pockets of excellent practice which can be used for benchmarking against other organisations. Cultural insights are imperative to understand organisations rationale on developing solutions which have implications for academia, practitioners, and policymakers.In this vein, we recognise the vital need for primary data analysis.

        <p>A rigorous theoretical framework is lacking in realigning the human relationship with nature with a requirement to go beyond the usual CSR mainstream theoretical frameworks (Cuckston, 2018a). We identify many studies lack a clear theoretical contribution. Such theoretical diversion from recognised CSR theories supports the literature that a multidisciplinary approach to B/E is required by collaboration between accountants and other discipline experts to increase knowledge (Jones and Solomon, 2013;Weir, 2018). Therefore, future studies may shift from traditional CSR theoretical frameworks and borrow theoretical framing from wider academic social science disciplines. In addition, an application of a triangulation of theories to support research is required and is supported by Gaia and Jones (2019) who argue a single theoretical application is inadequate for explanations. There are opportunities for researchers to apply theoretical frameworks that can explain human behaviour towards nature, which may help to develop solutions and enrich B/E literature.A rigorous theoretical framework is lacking in realigning the human relationship with nature with a requirement to go beyond the usual CSR mainstream theoretical frameworks (Cuckston, 2018a).

        <p>Based on our discussion above, the main gaps in the literature are identified through the analysis of this SLR. We observe that due to the embryonic nature of this strand of research, any contribution for understanding further the complicated relationship between global organisations and the biodiversity and species extinction crisis would extend knowledge in the field and help develop solutions. Qualitative contributions in the form of interviews are distinctly lacking. In addition to the above discussion, empirical quantitative studies measuring determinant factors such as board and ownership characteristics, country governance characteristics are underexplored. In addition, further research is required to establish if companies only provide disclosure on attractive, well-known species, which would suggest they are indulging in impression management, or if they are displaying concern by reporting on a variety of species. For example, a limitation in prior research is the study of single species such as the rhinoceros, a species of intrinsic worth for South African tourism (Atkins et al., 2018a), or the iconic panda in China (Zhao and Atkins;2018). Adler et al. (2018) provides a list of species disclosed by companies but fails to analyse. Weir (2018) finds higher profile species justifies more conservation efforts than others, which indicates a superficial bias approach to protecting nature. Therefore, a thorough investigation of species could explain motivations in conservation efforts. There is undoubted, fruitful potential for researchers to explore and contribute to this crucial research area.Based on our discussion above, the main gaps in the literature are identified through the analysis of this SLR.

        <p>The objective of this paper is to provide a rigorous SLR on organisational B/E accounting in response to the global challenge of biodiversity loss and species extinction. We synthesise 40 research publications and book chapters, providing descriptive results and critically analyse limitations in current research, identifying opportunities for future research. We acknowledge there are a limited amount of publications in this stream of literature; however, the publications presented offer an excellent insight into this crucial research area. We expect a high number of contributions in the coming years, from multidisciplinary fields as experts believe pandemics such as Covid-19 are a result of humanity's invasion of biodiversity (Ceballos et al., 2020). (Vidal, 2020). In addition, there remain abundant exploratory opportunities for larger samples of industry or country-specific studies to explain, challenge or, contribute to empirical evidence. Theoretically, an opportunity exists to challenge traditional CSR and SER theoretical frameworks to explain relationships (Cuckston, 2018a) and amplify knowledge. Furthermore, we identify there is a distinct lack of primary data, specifically interviews, to advance insights of organisational motivations which is desired to enrich literature (Atkins and Maroun, 2018;Skouloudis et al., 2019). Further empirical quantitative studies are essential to explore relationships between B/E disclosure and determinant factors such as country governance characteristics and ownership characteristics.The objective of this paper is to provide a rigorous SLR on organisational B/E accounting in response to the global challenge of biodiversity loss and species extinction.

        <p>Future research is imperative in this field as further biodiversity decline and species extinctions will cause profound economic and health impacts (Hassan et al., 2020b, Roberts, et al., 2020). To understand the complex relationship between organisations and nature, business schools must endeavour to promote B/E accounting within the wider SER and CSR discipline. Research opportunities, regardless of location, through conference, special issues or, collaborations between academics and multidisciplinary experts (Jones andSolomon, 2013, Weir, 2018) would provide a more balanced discussion and vitally increase knowledge to the field (Khan et al., 2020). Organisations are at the heart of achieving SDG-14 &amp;-15, biodiversity and species are the lifeblood of all businesses. Academics can raise awareness and promote positive change through research to prevent further biodiversity loss and species extinction.Future research is imperative in this field as further biodiversity decline and species extinctions will cause profound economic and health impacts (Hassan et al., 2020b, Roberts, et al., 2020).

        <p>This review emphasises the practical implication of corporate ethics and business culture must soften from the sole pursuit of profit and capitalist objectives. Hopefully, corporate ethics will change towards a more deep-ecological perspective from anthropocentric legitimising strategies. Stakeholders and policymakers will benefit from this research, educating them on the consequential economic loss if strategic operational changes are not changed. Developed countries show they have been willing participants in addressing B/E loss, but they may lack financial ability and understanding to address. Therefore, it would be beneficial for developed countries to provide technical and financial assistance to mitigate. This study evidences the evolution of B/E accounting, and there is little evidence to suggest accountants cannot be the drivers to reverse the planet from the brink of collapse. Accounting is a mechanism and tool for change, and accountants have the knowledge, capacity, and communication skills to lead in corporate accountability.This review emphasises the practical implication of corporate ethics and business culture must soften from the sole pursuit of profit and capitalist objectives.

        <p>Our study has several limitations. Firstly, we recognise there are a limited number of publications. However, we justify the need for this SLR due to the urgency in resolving the B/E crisis. Secondly, we select only peer-reviewed publications and book chapters, potentially eliminating some insightful knowledge on B/E. Thirdly, although results are classified by year, it should be noted two main contributors in 2018 account for almost all publications in the year.Our study has several limitations.

        <p>In addition, some academics provide multiple contributions, and this may provide a bias in methodologies, theoretical frameworks, or recommendations. Likewise, geographic results are an indication of only some of the overall literature sources. Prior literature on B/E accounting is exceptionally scarce.
