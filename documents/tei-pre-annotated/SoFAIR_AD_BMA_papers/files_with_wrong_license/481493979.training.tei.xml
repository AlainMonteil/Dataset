        <p>The exploration and retention of knowledge are key elements for improving innovative performance. Although some studies indicate that organizational culture (OC) is a factor that influences knowledge management in companies, the relationships between different types of OC and the adoption of open innovation (OI) remain unclear, especially in the context of emerging economies such as Brazil. Our study addresses this research gap by investigating the relationships among OC, inbound and outbound OI, innovation ecosystems and innovative performance. With data collected from 169 companies in Brazil, our main results show that adhocracy culture is the type of OC that most influences the adoption of inbound and outbound OI flows, and that hierarchy culture discourages the adoption of OI. Our results also suggest the importance of adopting knowledge management practices that foster creativity and flexibility.The exploration and retention of knowledge are key elements for improving innovative performance.

        <p>Organizational culture (OC) has long attracted the interest of researchers and practitioners from various management areas (Schein, 1992;Parveen et al., 2015). This interest has become increasingly important, largely because OC is now considered a key factor for business success (Hogan and Coote, 2013). OC can be defined as the norms, sets of values, social ideals or beliefs that are shared by the members of an organization (Martins and Terblanche, 2003).Organizational culture (OC) has long attracted the interest of researchers and practitioners from various management areas (Schein, 1992;Parveen et al., 2015).

        <p>By investigating such elements as a set of habits and values held by employees throughout their work activities, several studies have investigated OC and innovation in an integrated manner (e.g., Büschgens et al., 2013;Limaj and Bernroider, 2019;Zhang et al., 2019;Ghosh and Srivastava, 2021). This strategy has emerged based on previous findings showing that characteristics of OC can stimulate or inhibit innovation in companies (Büschgens et al., 2013;Martins and Terblanche, 2003). In the innovation management field, OI has for some decades stood out as one of the main management approaches (e.g., Chesbrough, 2003;Van de Vrande et al., 2009;Bogers et al., 2018;Ovuakporie et al., 2021). OI can be defined as a distributed innovation process based on purposively managed knowledge flows across organizational boundaries, using pecuniary and non-pecuniary mechanisms in line with each organization's business model (Chesbrough and Bogers, 2014).By investigating such elements as a set of habits and values held by employees throughout their work activities, several studies have investigated OC and innovation in an integrated manner (e.g., Büschgens et al., 2013;Limaj and Bernroider, 2019;Zhang et al., 2019;Ghosh and Srivastava, 2021).

        <p>Previous studies have investigated the relationships between OC and OI (Burcharth et al. 2014;Gassmann et al. 2011;Naqshbandi et al., 2015;Wiener et al., 2018;Zhang et al., 2019). These research efforts are based on the understanding that OC is an important dimension for successful OI adoption (Martín- de Castro, 2015;Wiener et al., 2018). For example, the "not invented here" syndrome, an aspect of OC, is a factor that admittedly tends to inhibit the adoption of OI (e.g., Katz and Allen, 1982;Burcharth et al. 2014). Through the lens of OC, Harrison and Corley (2011) have highlighted the importance of processes that absorb external ideas to assist the renewal of a company's internal culture, as well as suggesting that ideas developed internally can improve external culture. Furthermore, OC also plays a relevant role in the effectiveness of knowledge management, as it influences the ability of companies to explore and retain internal and external knowledge, (Alavi et al., 2005;Leal-Rodríguez et al., 2019). Research which takes a knowledge-based view (KBV) perspective on OI (Martín- de Castro 2015, Popa et al. 2017;Singh et al. 2021;Stephan et al. 2019) has also suggested the importance of exploring both internal and external sources of knowledge for companies, since this process can stimulate elements of OC which are oriented towards innovation (Ghosh and Bhupen, 2021), such as knowledge transfer from diverse groups, capacity to receive, share, transfer and absorb new knowledge, and strengthening the creation and construction of open ecosystems (Kogut and Zander, 1992;Lopes and Esteves, 2013;Santoro et al., 2018;Singh et al. 2021).Previous studies have investigated the relationships between OC and OI (Burcharth et al. 2014;Gassmann et al. 2011;Naqshbandi et al., 2015;Wiener et al., 2018;Zhang et al., 2019).

        <p>However, little is currently known about how different types of OC influence OI adoption, especially in the context of emerging economies, such as Brazil. Thus, the purpose of this study is to contribute to that debate and fill this gap by investigating how the various types of OC influence inbound and outbound OI. This research also aims to answer the following research question, which requires further clarification: What types of OC favor the adoption of OI? Moreover, this research also investigates the relationships between inbound and outbound flows and innovative performance, simultaneously considering the moderating effect of the innovation ecosystem. This research is based on an opportunity to present and analyze the types of OC that benefit and encourage mechanisms such as the generation, absorption and transfer of knowledge in companies operating in emerging economies (in this case Brazil), a context in which little is known regarding the application and results of the KBV, and which still deserves to be further explored (Pereira and Bamel, 2021). In order to investigate this area, we have conducted a quantitative study involving 169 companies operating within the information technology and chemical sectors in Brazil.However, little is currently known about how different types of OC influence OI adoption, especially in the context of emerging economies, such as Brazil.

        <p>It is widely recognized that national culture influences OC (Nelson and Gopalan, 2003;Zhang and Hung, 2020), as well as that there are influential relationships between OC and the results of knowledge management and innovation (e.g., Gray and Densten, 2005;Büschgens et al., 2013;Naqshbandi et al., 2015;Pereira and Bamel, 2021). In addition, a high level of innovation within a particular country also tends to indicate improved national quality of life (Woodside et al., 2016). However, there have so far been few studies relating to these themes within hierarchical societies, such as Brazil (Hofstede et al., 2010), where OC characteristics such as collectivism, power distance, and uncertainty avoidance are prevalent (Hofstede, 2001;Hofstede et al., 2010). In addition to these characteristics, Chu and Wood Jr. (2008) also mention the following relevant factors in Brazilian OC: improvisation for problem solving and achievement of objectives; people's adaptability and creativity; high importance placed on social relations; and ease of integration of foreign practices and customs. These unique characteristics make Brazil an interesting context in which to analyze the influence of OC on knowledge management activities and outcomes. Furthermore, it is important to expand the range of studies on innovation in Brazil, as the country has been highlighted in terms of innovation in Latin America, in terms of investment in R&amp;D, number of patents, and published scientific journal articles (Olavarrieta and Villena, 2014). Moreover, as noted by Giannetti and Rubera (2020), the literature on innovation in emerging economies has been concentrated mainly in China and India and has neglected some of the largest emerging economies, such as Brazil. The few works on OI in Brazil are consistent in showing that the country tends towards openness, but that OI patterns in emerging economies differ from more developed countries due to particularities in the cultural and institutional context (Armellini et al., 2014;Bogers et al., 2021).

        <p>In terms of the industrial sectors chosen, we decided to focus on the chemical and information technology industries because these fields are recognized for presenting high levels of OI (Chesbrough, 2003;OECD, 2008). Specifically, areas of the information technology industry-such as digital technology, hardware and software-are among the key global trends in OI (Bogers et al., 2018). In addition, the information technology field is one of the most innovative industries in the Brazilian economy (IBGE, 2016), and Brazil is ranked first in terms of investment in the Latin American information technology industry, as well as ninth globally (Abes, 2018). Considering the chemical sector, this field comprises several industries that are technologically complex, such as pharmaceuticals, paints, petrochemicals, varnishes, fertilizers and artificial fibers. Due to the characteristics of its products, the chemical sector supplies a wide range of other industries (Silva Jr. et al., 2017), as well as being largely responsible for the diffusion of technology to other industrial sectors, such as textiles and real estate.In terms of the industrial sectors chosen, we decided to focus on the chemical and information technology industries because these fields are recognized for presenting high levels of OI (Chesbrough, 2003;OECD, 2008).

        <p>Furthermore, the chemical sector makes up a significant proportion of Brazil's GDP (Abequim, 2018). Therefore, by investigating the relationships between types of OC and inbound and outbound flows in important industrial sectors for OI (chemical and information technology) in the Brazilian context, our study presents unique results that may contribute to the theoretical discussion of OI and the knowledge-based view (Irwin et al., 2018;Santoro et al., 2018).Furthermore, the chemical sector makes up a significant proportion of Brazil's GDP (Abequim, 2018).

        <p>The OI concept, as proposed by Chesbrough (2003), has received significant attention from both practitioners and researchers (e.g., Laursen and Salter, 2014;Rauter et al., 2019) because of its potential to intensify the flow of internal and external knowledge in order to improve the innovation process. OI can be defined as a distributed innovation process based on purposively managed knowledge flows across organizational boundaries, using both pecuniary and non-pecuniary mechanisms in line with each organization's business model (Chesbrough and Bogers, 2014). The ability of companies to create and transfer knowledge in order to strengthen OI has also been addressed in diverse works using the KBV perspective (e.g., Santoro et al., 2019;Stephan et al., 2018;Pereira and Bamel, 2021). For example, Santoro et al. (2018) suggest that companies must be able to absorb both explicit and tacit knowledge regarding their OI relationships and convert this knowledge into innovation. Singh et al. (2012) note that that increased knowledge sharing benefits OI in selected small-sized United Arab Emirates-based firms.The OI concept, as proposed by Chesbrough (2003), has received significant attention from both practitioners and researchers (e.g., Laursen and Salter, 2014;Rauter et al., 2019) because of its potential to intensify the flow of internal and external knowledge in order to improve the innovation process.

        <p>Studies addressing the use of external flows of knowledge to improve the innovation process have suggested that organizations can operationalize OI by intensifying firms' collaborations with suppliers, customers, universities, research institutes, clients and others (e.g., Laursen and Salter, 2014;Jugend et al., 2018;Rauter et al., 2019). Regarding internal flows, their development is recommended to stimulate the use of ideas and the integration of knowledge that is internal to the company. Firms can accomplish this by, for example, increasing employees' participation in innovation activities (Van de Vrande et al., 2009;Burcharth et al., 2014) and harnessing employee-generated ideas, which can be selected to assist future product development as well as procedural and organizational changes (Salter et al., 2015). OI can be operationalized based on two types of knowledge flows: inbound and outbound (Chesbrough, 2006); this can also be a combined process, integrating both inbound and outbound flows (Gassmann and Enkel, 2006;Sikimic et al., 2016).Studies addressing the use of external flows of knowledge to improve the innovation process have suggested that organizations can operationalize OI by intensifying firms' collaborations with suppliers, customers, universities, research institutes, clients and others (e.g., Laursen and Salter, 2014;Jugend et al., 2018;Rauter et al., 2019).

        <p>The acquisition of ideas and technological knowledge from external sources, in addition to generating them internally, is known as inbound OI (Bianchi et al., 2016). As firms often require knowledge and technology beyond that which they are capable of developing internally, inbound practices tend to play a relevant role in innovation activities (Kim et al., 2016). These pieces of knowledge and technology can come from external environmental actors (e.g., research institutes, consultants, universities, and other firms) that have the potential to help companies in their innovation activities (Laursen and Salter, 2006;Jugend et al., 2018).The acquisition of ideas and technological knowledge from external sources, in addition to generating them internally, is known as inbound OI (Bianchi et al., 2016).

        <p>According to Naqshbandi et al. (2018), inbound OI relates to the use of discoveries made by other organizations and involves opening and establishing relationships with external actors. This implies intentional input of knowledge or exploitation of external technologies and knowledge to improve internal innovative performance. Aspects such as absorptive capacity (Spithoven et al., 2010;Jasimuddin and Naqshbandi, 2019) and the company's ability to share and avoid knowledge leakage (Ritala et al., 2015) should be considered part of inbound OI.According to Naqshbandi et al.

        <p>Inbound OI can be especially useful for young, high-tech, resource-poor companies such as startups, which often need to acquire knowledge and technology from external partners (Zhang et al., 2016).Inbound OI can be especially useful for young, high-tech, resource-poor companies such as startups, which often need to acquire knowledge and technology from external partners (Zhang et al., 2016).</p>
        <p>With outbound OI, companies do not rely only on internal paths to market; rather, they also seek out external organizations that are better able to commercialize their knowledge or technologies than they can themselves (Spithoven et al., 2010). Through outbound practices, sending unused or under-used ideas and technologies outside the company for use by other organizations and businesses is encouraged (Bogers et al., 2018); this transmission can occur through licensing of technologies, selling of patents and the creation of spin-offs, for example (Chesbrough, 2006;Kutvonen, 2011;Hung and Chou, 2013;Parida, et al., 2012).With outbound OI, companies do not rely only on internal paths to market; rather, they also seek out external organizations that are better able to commercialize their knowledge or technologies than they can themselves (Spithoven et al., 2010).

        <p>According to Kim et al. (2016), existing works in this field generally focus on only a single type of flow, delimiting their analysis to either inbound or outbound OI. While recognizing the importance of an integrated conception of inbound and outbound flows (Mazzola et al., 2012;Ovuakporie et al., 2021), some research (e.g., Greco et al., 2015;Zhang et al., 2016;Armellini et al., 2018) has suggested that inbound OI generally receives more attention from researchers, and especially from practitioners.According to Kim et al.

        <p>In their theoretical review, Harrison and Corle (2011) demonstrate that OC is composed of a long-lasting set of shared attitudes, values and meanings that influence the thinking and behavior of the members of a company. Shein (1992) and Aldhuwaihi (2013) define OC as a model of assumptions that groups within an organization develop in order to address the issues of external adaptation and internal integration. Due to its influence on employee behavior (Chang and Lin, 2007), OC has been extensively investigated in relation to innovation activities and their outcomes, as well as performance (Mortara and Minshall, 2011). For example, change-resistant behavior, knowledge sharing among employees and non-acceptance of external innovation are OCrelated factors that are known to influence companies' ability to innovate (e.g., Büschgens et al., 2013;Hogan and Coote, 2014;Wiener et al., 2018). In this sense, Hogan and Coote (2014) highlight management's role in encouraging employee support for innovative behaviors in order to achieve an OC that drives innovation. Quinn and Rohrbaugh (1983) propose a framework with three dimensions for analyzing OC: (i) focus (internal versus external); (ii) structure (stable and controlling versus flexible and adaptable); and (iii) means-end (proximity to desired organizational results). In this sense, the framework originally presented by Cameron and Quinn (1985) with which to analyze OC has continued to be investigated and discussed in later works (Cameron and Quinn, 1999;Cameron and Quinn, 2006).In their theoretical review, Harrison and Corle (2011) demonstrate that OC is composed of a long-lasting set of shared attitudes, values and meanings that influence the thinking and behavior of the members of a company.

        <p>The Cameron and Quinn model (2006) proposes four cultural types: clan, adhocracy, hierarchy, and market; this model has been widely used across several research areas, including innovation (Škerlava et al., 2010;Naranjo-Valencia et al., 2011;Wiener et al., 2018;Limaj and Bernroider, 2019;Sánchez-Báez et al., 2019), knowledge management (Gray and Densten 2005;Wiewiora et al., 2013;Santoro et al., 2018), environmental sustainability (Reyes-Santiago and Díaz-Pichardo, 2019;Islam et al., 2019), organizational effectiveness (Hartnell et al., 2011), quality management (Gimenez-Espin et al., 2013;Valmohammadi and Roshanzamir, 2015) and human resources (Rohim and Budhiasa, 2019). Addressing knowledge management, some studies have indicated that innovation depends on OC that improves the mechanisms of knowledge creation, transfer, and absorption (e.g., Gray and Densten, 2005;Santoro et al., 2018;Borges et al., 2019;Pereira and Mohiya, 2021). Comparing organizational cultures in terms of knowledge conversion, Gray and Densten (2005) also point out that in adhocratic companies, externalization is the most notable feature, while those of the hierarchical type are characterized by internalization. Pereira and Mohiya (2021) also observe that the type of OC influences knowledge transfer activities, as a positive and collaborative organizational environment tends to encourage knowledge sharing among employees.The Cameron and Quinn model (2006) proposes four cultural types: clan, adhocracy, hierarchy, and market; this model has been widely used across several research areas, including innovation (Škerlava et al., 2010;Naranjo-Valencia et al., 2011;Wiener et al., 2018;Limaj and Bernroider, 2019;Sánchez-Báez et al., 2019), knowledge management (Gray and Densten 2005;Wiewiora et al., 2013;Santoro et al., 2018), environmental sustainability (Reyes-Santiago and Díaz-Pichardo, 2019;Islam et al., 2019), organizational effectiveness (Hartnell et al., 2011), quality management (Gimenez-Espin et al., 2013;Valmohammadi and Roshanzamir, 2015) and human resources (Rohim and Budhiasa, 2019).

        <p>Considering these four types of OC, Cameron and Quin (2006) and Gray and Densten (2005) also observe that an organization does not necessarily have only a single culture, but will have a dominant one, represented by its most commonly shared values and behaviors. The following section presents a brief definition of each of these types of organizational culture.Considering these four types of OC, Cameron and Quin (2006) and Gray and Densten (2005) also observe that an organization does not necessarily have only a single culture, but will have a dominant one, represented by its most commonly shared values and behaviors. The following section presents a brief definition of each of these types of organizational culture.</p>
        <p>Clan culture has values similar to those of a family business, in which the sense of belonging to the organization is strong, and there is an affective relationship between people and the organization (Cameron and Quinn, 2006). Due to its adherence to the typical values of extended families, this type of culture possesses the characteristic of flexibility, but its focus is on internal organization, teamwork, employee involvement and corporate commitment to employees (Cameron and Quinn, 2006). Moonen (2017) also notes that in this type of culture, feelings of loyalty and tradition are strong and that leaders are usually seen as mentors or as paternal figures. Büschgens et al. (2013) also suggest that in clan organizations, individuals share common values and beliefs, which guide members of the organization towards a perspective based on the best interests of the collective.Clan culture has values similar to those of a family business, in which the sense of belonging to the organization is strong, and there is an affective relationship between people and the organization (Cameron and Quinn, 2006).

        <p>According to Cameron and Quinn (2006), the clan organization type is common in companies at the beginning of their life cycle. Thus, inbound OI can favor newer companies with scarce resources, especially startups, since these types of companies tend to acquire technologies and products from external partners (Zhang et al., 2016). This fact may raise questions regarding the use of inbound OI by clan-type organizations. Naranjo-Valencia et al. (2011) observe that the values of productivity and competitiveness are typical characteristics of clan culture organizations. In this vein, Wiener et al.

        <p>The type of OC named 'adhocracy' is characterized by its promotion of adaptability, flexibility and creativity in uncertain environments (Cameron and Quinn, 2006;Rohim and Budhiasa, 2019). Because adhocracy usually exists in dynamic environments, the major task for management in adhocratic organizations is promoting adaptation, entrepreneurship, and creativity in the development of products and services (Cameron and Quinn, 2006;Leal-Rodríguez et al., 2019). The ability to respond more quickly to changes and take greater risks are also characteristics of the adhocratic culture (Leal-Rodríguez et al., 2019).The type of OC named 'adhocracy' is characterized by its promotion of adaptability, flexibility and creativity in uncertain environments (Cameron and Quinn, 2006;Rohim and Budhiasa, 2019).

        <p>Due to the characteristics of flexibility and creativity, studies by authors such as Naranjo-Valencia and Sanz-Valle (2016) and Leal-Rodríguez et al. (2015) have highlighted that adhocracy culture tends to stimulate innovation and openness (Wiener et al., 2018).Due to the characteristics of flexibility and creativity, studies by authors such as Naranjo-Valencia and Sanz-Valle (2016) and Leal-Rodríguez et al.

        <p>Gimenez-Espin et al. ( 2013) also point to continuous improvement, risk taking, development of products and development of creative solutions as elements of adhocratic culture. In this sense, Khazanchi et al. (2007) note that the presence and valuing of flexibility promotes a culture of experimentation, which tends to stimulate employees' creativity. Thus, following the reasoning set forth by these characteristics, we hypothesize that:Gimenez-Espin et al.

        <p>The 'hierarchy' OC category usually operates in more stable environments and follows the principles of the Weberian school of thought, such as specialization, hierarchy, separate ownership, meritocracy and impersonality (Cameron and Quinn, 2006;Moonen, 2017). Companies with this cultural characteristic follow well-defined rules aimed at creating more efficient processes (Hartnell et al., 2011). Hierarchical culture is also oriented towards internal focus and control (Škerlavaj et al., 2010), and its key characteristics are efficiency and close adherence to rules and regulations (Naranjo-Valencia and Sanz-Valle, 2016). This type of culture favors rules, policies and procedures to the detriment of agility (Moonen, 2017).The 'hierarchy' OC category usually operates in more stable environments and follows the principles of the Weberian school of thought, such as specialization, hierarchy, separate ownership, meritocracy and impersonality (Cameron and Quinn, 2006;Moonen, 2017).

        <p>Due to its focus on prioritizing the stability and predictability of processes, Büschgens et al. (2013) and Wang and Chung (2013) find negative relationships between hierarchical culture and organizational innovation. Moonen (2017) also notes that in organizations of the hierarchical type, there is usually a tension between innovation and compliance with rules. In the same vein, Hartog and Verburg (2004) observe that rules-based guidance impairs the autonomy of employees. This emphasis on stability and control tends to contribute to greater resistance to change and also to decreasing the absorptive capacity of companies with this type of culture (Harrington and Guimaraes, 2005).

        <p>This type of culture is based on the premise that the market is hostile and is populated by demanding customers; thus, management must direct the company towards aggressiveness, productivity, results and competitiveness (Cameron and Quinn, 2006). In aiming to obtain competitive advantages, market culture emphasizes transactions with the external environment (Cameron and Quinn, 2006;Golden and Shriner, 2019), especially transactions involving customers and suppliers (Gimenez-Espin et al., 2013). These characteristics tend to favor a culture which unites members towards achieving common goals (Wiewiora et al., 2013) and the sharing of knowledge among employees (Rohim and Budhiasa, 2019). Considering the characteristics of the market culture type, Polding (2016) observes that the exchange of individual financial incentives for collective goals tends to make companies more competitive. However, stability and control are the primary means emphasized by organizations with market-type OC to achieve their goals (Cameron and Quinn, 2006;Pilch and Turska, 2015), which can inhibit open collaboration (Wiener et al., 2018).This type of culture is based on the premise that the market is hostile and is populated by demanding customers; thus, management must direct the company towards aggressiveness, productivity, results and competitiveness (Cameron and Quinn, 2006).

        <p>Innovative performance is one of the key drivers of organizational performance and can reflect how the firm's innovation efforts reflect its overall objectives (Gunday et al., 2011).Innovative performance is one of the key drivers of organizational performance and can reflect how the firm's innovation efforts reflect its overall objectives (Gunday et al., 2011).</p>
        <p>Innovative performance is associated with the creation of new products and services, the production process and the adoption of successful new management and marketing practices (Hagedoorn and Cloodt 2003;Jugend et al., 2018;Koo and Lee, 2018), and can be assessed at all stages of the innovation process, from R&amp;D investment to market launch (Hagedoorn and Cloodt, 2003). Schneider and Veugelers (2010) suggest that companies with better innovative performance usually achieve better sales results. For Filippetti and Guy (2020), innovative performance not only depends on a company's internal resources and R&amp;D activities, but also benefits from the knowledge and skills developed outside the company, in partnership with external actors (e.g., customers, suppliers and universities). Some studies have analyzed the results of adopting OI in terms of innovative performance (e.g., Laursen and Salter, 2006;Cheng and Shiu, 2015;Jugend et al., 2018;Rauter et al., 2018;Ovuakporie et al., 2021). Laursen and Salter (2006) note that, up to a point, more open companies tend to be more innovative. Cheng and Shiu (2015) verify that inbound activities tend to improve radical innovative performance, while outbound practices have more effect on performance in terms of incremental innovations. Analyzing OI in small and medium sized companies, Popa et al. (2017) note that inbound and outbound OI efforts also tend to improve firm performance.Innovative performance is associated with the creation of new products and services, the production process and the adoption of successful new management and marketing practices (Hagedoorn and Cloodt 2003;Jugend et al., 2018;Koo and Lee, 2018), and can be assessed at all stages of the innovation process, from R&amp;D investment to market launch (Hagedoorn and Cloodt, 2003).

        <p>Considering the concept of business ecosystems, Moore (1993) observes that a business cannot be seen as a member of a single industry, but is rather a part of a business ecosystem including a variety of interconnected industries, in which firms coevolve their capabilities in terms of innovations. Iansiti and Levien (2004) define a business ecosystem as a set of complex interdependencies between companies that make the companies more productive and innovative. Munigala et al. (2018) emphasize that all components of an ecosystem may interact with one another, and that an innovation ecosystem can contribute to the successful transfer of knowledge and technologies (Bacon et al., 2019). For Mazzucato and Robson (2018), the innovation ecosystem must take into account the perspectives of multiple actors, where these various actors interact in the form of a network of companies with which they cooperate and, at the same time, compete. Adner (2006) introduced the concept of innovation ecosystems, whose focus is on value creation, differing from business ecosystems, whose focus is on value capture (Gomes et al., 2018;Adner and Kapoor, 2010). The concept of innovation ecosystems is frequently cited within the OI literature. To Chesbrough and Appleyard (2007), innovation ecosystems play a significant role in boosting companies' individual innovation strategies. For Rohrbeck et al. (2009), an innovation ecosystem is formed by companies working together both cooperatively and competitively, in a system of open innovation. Laursen and Salter (2006) point out the importance of the innovation ecosystem in OI while noting that the external environment also shapes companies' use of different knowledge sources. In terms of OI, an organization forms part of an ecosystem that can include a variety of interconnected actors, including customers, suppliers, competitors, universities and others who play various roles in the value-creation process (Radziwon and Bogers, 2018). Some studies have suggested that strong OI performance also depends on the participation of multiple organizations that coexist and cooperate within an ecosystem in order to create and maintain products, services, and markets (Silva et al. 2018;Pitelis and Teece, 2018). Silva et al. (2018) point out that performance improvements resulting from collaboration within these ecosystems can generate positive results in terms of innovation, such as the development of new products, technologies, market knowledge and intellectual property. Thus, we understand that performance improvements obtained through interactions within an innovation ecosystem can moderate the relationships between inbound and outbound OI flows and innovative performance. Therefore, these final hypotheses are proposed: H11: The performance of the innovation ecosystem affects the relationship between inbound OI flows and innovative performance.Considering the concept of business ecosystems, Moore (1993) observes that a business cannot be seen as a member of a single industry, but is rather a part of a business ecosystem including a variety of interconnected industries, in which firms coevolve their capabilities in terms of innovations.

For example, Kim et al. (2016) indicate that, compared to bigger firms, smaller firms typically have fewer resources for developing innovation, and therefore tend to rely more on the external environment.

        <p>To define company size, the survey utilized criteria from the Brazilian Service for Support for Micro and Small Companies (known as SEBRAE, its acronym in Portuguese). We thus defined micro companies as those with 1 to 19 employees, small companies as those with 20 to 99 employees, medium companies as those with 100 to 499 employees, and large companies as those with more than 500 employees. We used four categories to define company age: up to 5 years old, 6-10, 11-20, and more than 20 years old.To define company size, the survey utilized criteria from the Brazilian Service for Support for Micro and Small Companies (known as SEBRAE, its acronym in Portuguese).

        <p>The questionnaire was sent to the companies using 
            <rs type="software">Google Forms</rs>. We used the databases of (i) the Brazilian Association of Software Companies (known as ABES, its acronym in Portuguese), containing 1,038 companies, and (ii) the Brazilian Chemical Industry Association (known as ABIQUIM, its acronym in Portuguese), with approximately 720 companies, operating in various industrial areas, such as paints, pharmaceuticals, laboratory equipment, fertilizers, and fibers. All the companies registered in these databases at the time of the investigation were contacted by email with an invitation to participate in the survey. After initially sending out these invitations, 398 e-mails were not received or were returned due to incorrect or outdated contact details, or because the companies no longer exist. In total we received valid, completed questionnaires from 169 companies. This number fulfills the minimum sample size requirement (n = 118) that we obtained with the help of the

        <p>Before analyzing the data, we decided to test for a number of the biases associated with our sampling characteristics, which is required according to the standard metrics for reporting the results of partial least squares (PLS) analysis (Benitez et al., 2020;Latan, 2018). First, we examined non-response bias to ensure that the characteristics of our sample do not differ from the general sampling frame. We did this by comparing those respondents who responded early with those who responded after the cutoff date, using an independent sample t-test. This test was deployed to ensure that the sample used is not biased and has the same characteristics as those respondents who did not take part in the survey. Table 1 shows that we obtained a Levene's test value of p &gt; 0.05, meaning that the assumption of homogeneity was fulfilled. Furthermore, our results showed insignificant differences in the equality of means values between the two sample groups (p &gt; 0.05) for the variables tested. In addition, to ensure the robustness of these results, we also assessed the missing data from the returned surveys as a more robust approach to detecting this bias (Groves, 2006). This testing found our data to be missing completely at random (MCAR). Hence, we can conclude that non-response bias is not a threat to our empirical results. Second, we examined common method bias to assess measurement errors, which may occur as a result of correlations between items that measure constructs in the same way. This bias is generally related to the use of the self-reporting technique when collecting data, as using the same measurement method may produce results that are correlated with each other. To detect this bias, we used the Average Full Collinearity VIF (Kock 2017) 2 shows that the majority of respondents held positions directly related to decision-making concerning innovation management (e.g., business owners, directors, and engineers).Before analyzing the data, we decided to test for a number of the biases associated with our sampling characteristics, which is required according to the standard metrics for reporting the results of partial least squares (PLS) analysis (Benitez et al., 2020;Latan, 2018). First, we examined non-response bias to ensure that the characteristics of our sample do not differ from the general sampling frame. We did this by comparing those respondents who responded early with those who responded after the cutoff date, using an independent sample t-test. This test was deployed to ensure that the sample used is not biased and has the same characteristics as those respondents who did not take part in the survey. Table 1 shows that we obtained a Levene's test value of p &gt; 0.05, meaning that the assumption of homogeneity was fulfilled. Furthermore, our results showed insignificant differences in the equality of means values between the two sample groups (p &gt; 0.05) for the variables tested. In addition, to ensure the robustness of these results, we also assessed the missing data from the returned surveys as a more robust approach to detecting this bias (Groves, 2006). This testing found our data to be missing completely at random (MCAR). Hence, we can conclude that non-response bias is not a threat to our empirical results.

        <p>At present, various types of multivariate analysis are available for use with the support of a range of sophisticated pieces of software. As noted in recently published guidelines (Auginis et al., 2018;Latan, 2018), researchers should reveal their reasons for choosing a particular method when analyzing their data. Given that our model utilizes a number of unobserved variables, structural equation modeling (SEM) is the most prominent method currently used for this type of research in this field. There are two types of SEM -covariancebased SEM (CB-SEM) and composite-based SEM (PLS-PM) -which complement each other, rather than competing (Jöreskog and Wold, 1982). We chose to use PLS-PM to analyze our data based on a number of key considerations. First, PLS-PM is a valuable method for estimating models in large systems, where the model is considered complex, with dozens of constructs and indicators (Latan and Noonan, 2017). In this case, our model can be considered to be quite complex, making it difficult to apply CB-SEM or regression analysis (Ramli et al., 2018). Additionally, PLS-PM is more suitable for use when the field of study in question is still in the early stages of exploration, at the advanced testing stage, or both, concerning the relationships between variables (Henseler, 2021). In this context, PLS-PM enables researchers to test models that have various research objectives (Henseler, 2021), which is considered important for the development of theory and practice. Finally, PLS-PM is a continually developing method and offers advanced features that can help to assess our model and hypotheses.At present, various types of multivariate analysis are available for use with the support of a range of sophisticated pieces of software.

        <p>Although PLS-PM relies on soft principles, recent developments in its use have suggested considering a number of assumptions when running the PLS algorithm, including sample size, model identification and collinearity between latent variables. For our research, we found a minimum sample size requirement of 118 cases (where the effect size is 0.15, the power level required is 0.80 and the number of predictors is 10), which was fulfilled in this study. In addition, to ensure that our model is appropriately identified, we used multiple items rather than single items, with a minimum number of three indicators per construct. In short, the process of data analysis and the reporting of results in this study follow recent guidelines, which have been well documented (Benitez et al., 2020;Latan, 2018). This process was followed through three main steps, namely evaluation of the measurement model (a.k.a outer model), evaluation of the structural model (a.k.a inner model) and testing of hypotheses, as well as robustness checks.Although PLS-PM relies on soft principles, recent developments in its use have suggested considering a number of assumptions when running the PLS algorithm, including sample size, model identification and collinearity between latent variables.

        <p>We executed our model and tested the proposed hypotheses using the 
            <rs type="software">SmartPLS 3</rs> software (Ringle et al., 2015), one of the leading pieces of PLS software currently in use. We selected the weighting scheme (path) with the maximum number of iterations at 300 and the stop criterion (10^-X) = 7 on the PLS algorithm. Furthermore, in terms of bootstrapping, we selected a bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap, with a resample number of 5,000 (complete bootstrapping) and 5% significance (two-tailed). The results obtained are described below.

        <p>We carried out the PLS-PM analysis step by step and in accordance with recent guidelines. In the first step, we assessed the results of the measurement model for each latent variable and its indicators. This step is intended to assess the validity and reliability of the indicators that measure the constructs in our model. Drawing on standard evaluation guidelines (Benitez et al., 2020;Latan, 2018), we used several core metrics that are commonly used in PLS to report the assessment of the outer model, including convergent validity, discriminant validity and construct reliability. The assessment of convergent validity aims to ensure that each indicator measures what it should measure.We carried out the PLS-PM analysis step by step and in accordance with recent guidelines.

The assessment of convergent validity aims to ensure that each indicator measures what it should measure.</p>
        <p>We tested convergent validity by looking at the factor loading values and average variance extracted (AVE). The factor loading value for each indicator or variable should be &gt; 0.6, and the AVE should be &gt; 0.5 (Benitez et al., 2020;Hair et al., 2017). As depicted in Tables 3 and4, the factor loading and AVE values we obtained for each indicator of the construct met this threshold. Only a few construct indicators (i.e., certain items of HRC, INB and OTB) yielded values slightly below this threshold, and these were, accordingly, excluded from the model (Hair et al., 2017) in order to strengthen convergent validity (see Figure 2). Furthermore, the assessment of construct reliability is intended to test the consistency of measurements. We tested construct reliability using two measures: Cronbach's Alpha (α) and composite reliability (ρc). The threshold values for α and ρc are recommended to be &gt; 0.70 (Hair et al. 2017;Nunnally and Bernstein 1994). We obtained values above 0.748 for both measures for all constructs in the model (see Table 3 and4 The final process in assessing the measurement model is to test discriminant validity, which is done in order to ensure that the measurements for separate constructs are not correlated. We used the heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) ratio as a contemporary approach to evaluate discriminant validity in this case, as this method is considered to outperform other classical approaches (e.g., the Fornell-Larcker criterion). Scholars suggest that the threshold of values greater than 0.90 for HTMT indicates conceptually similar constructs, while HTMT values less than 0.90 indicate that constructs are conceptually distinct (Hair et al., 2017;Henseler, 2021). In Table 5, we conclude that discriminant validity is met for our case, with HTMT values &lt; 0.90 for the two construct relationships presented, based on 95% BCaWe tested convergent validity by looking at the factor loading values and average variance extracted (AVE).

        <p>The second step after assessing the measurement model and making sure the indicators are valid and reliable is the structural model assessment. In this stage, we evaluated the quality of our inner PLS model by assessing various core metrics to report the structural model assessment. We began by considering the coefficient of determination (R 2 ), followed by effect size (f 2 ), predictive relevance (Q 2 ) and variance inflation factor (VIF). In addition, we assessed our model's out-of-sample predictive power by conducting the PLS predict procedure (Hair et al., 2017). We obtained results as depicted in Table 6 andFigure 2017), these values are quite significant, indicating that the predictors in the model are able to explain the variance in the construct. However, the values of R 2 and adjusted R 2 will depend on the number of predictor variables in the model and the phenomenon being investigated (Benitez et al., 2020;Hair et al., 2017). Given that social science research involves a large number of variables and that this study was undertaken at an early stage of the exploration of this specific area, a lower R 2 value may be considered substantial and acceptable in this case. On the other hand, R 2 values which are too high (e.g., &gt; 0.90) are an indication of over-fit and the occurrence of collinearity between variables. Our model explains 17.4%, 29.8% and 31% of the variance found in outbound (OTB), inbound (INB) and innovation performance (INP), respectively. In addition, the effect size (f 2 ) was evaluated to measure the magnitude of the effect for each predictor in the model. We obtained good f 2 values, ranging from 0.008-0.133, which are included in the small and moderate categories. This shows the respective contributions to the variance seen in the model. Just like actors in a movie, there are those that play leading roles and those that play secondary roles. Therefore, it is not possible for all predictors to have the same f 2 value in a PLS model.The second step after assessing the measurement model and making sure the indicators are valid and reliable is the structural model assessment.

Therefore, it is not possible for all predictors to have the same f 2 value in a PLS model.</p>
        <p>In the next process, we performed a blindfolding procedure to assess the predictive relevance (Q 2 ) of the PLS model. Values of Q 2 larger than zero are considered meaningful. Our model produced Q 2 values ranging from 0.072-0.180, indicating a good level of predictive relevance. We also obtained VIF values of &lt; 3.3 for each predictor in the model, which indicates that there is no vertical or lateral collinearity between latent variables (Kock and Lynn 2012). Finally, we assessed the model's out-of-sample predictive power by conducting the PLS predict procedure to generate holdout sample-based point predictions for the constructs in our model. Because our sample size meets the minimum requirements and is in the medium size category, we used ten folds and ten replications, comparing the root mean squared error (RMSE) values from the PLS-PM analysis with those generated by a naive linear benchmark (Hair et al., 2017). The results of our analysis indicate that PLS-PM yields lower prediction errors than the naive benchmark for all the indicators related to CLN, ADH, HRC, MRK, OTB, INB and INP, offering clear support for our PLS model's predictive power.In the next process, we performed a blindfolding procedure to assess the predictive relevance (Q 2 ) of the PLS model.

        <p>The third step in our analysis procedure is to test the hypotheses proposed through the bootstrapping approach. To do this, we assessed the direction of the estimated parameter coefficients, which are similar to the standardized regression coefficients, as well as the p-value of the 95% confidence intervals. As illustrated in Table 7, most of the path coefficients (direct effect) on the relationships between variables are supported, while some are not supported in this instance. Specifically, the relationships between clan culture (CLN), adhocratic culture (ADH) and inbound (INB) were found to be significant, with beta (β) values of 0.111 and between clan culture (CLN), adhocratic culture (ADH) and outbound (OTB) were also considered significant, with beta (β) values of 0.218 and 0.324, respectively, and significant at p &lt; 0.05 of 95% BCa CI. This means that hypotheses 1, 2, 3 and 4 (H1-H4) are supported.The third step in our analysis procedure is to test the hypotheses proposed through the bootstrapping approach.

        <p>The final step of our data analysis was to carry out robustness tests to keep our main results unbiased and prevent mistakes in drawing empirical conclusions. This is a mandatory standard for reporting the results of PLS analysis, as suggested by the recent literature (Hair et al., 2018, Latan, 2018).

        <p>is no inverse causality between variables (Peel 2014;Zaefarian et al. 2017). We performed the Heckman test to check this bias with the help of the 
            <rs type="software">Stata</rs>
            <rs type="version">16.0</rs> software. As shown in At the end of our robustness testing, we also considered unobserved heterogeneity bias, as a serious threat to the validity of our PLS results. As suggested by the recent guidelines (Hair et al. 2019;Latan, 2018), this supplementary analysis should be conducted to ensure that this bias does not interfere with our results. We assessed this bias using the finite mixture PLS (FIMIX-PLS) approach, following the multi-method procedure proposed by Sarstedt et al. (2017). The results of FIMIX-PLS provide goodness of fit indices such as Akaike's information criterion modified with factor 3 (AIC3), consistent Akaike's information criterion (CAIC), modified AIC with factor 4 (AIC4), the Bayesian information criteria (BIC) and minimum description length with factor 5 (MDL5). In this case, all of these results fall into the k = 1 segment, which indicates that unobserved heterogeneity is not a threat to our results.

        <p>Although the existing literature has previously indicated that OC influences innovative and OI performance, our research presents a new model that integrates the four types of OC proposed by Cameron and Quinn (2006) and their impact on OI and innovative performance, as well as considering innovation ecosystem performance as a moderating variable. Moreover, this research framework was tested in the Brazilian business environment, which differs from most prior research in the field, which has been concentrated in North America, Asia, and Europe, in industry sectors recognized for typically presenting high levels of OI.Although the existing literature has previously indicated that OC influences innovative and OI performance, our research presents a new model that integrates the four types of OC proposed by Cameron and Quinn (2006) and their impact on OI and innovative performance, as well as considering innovation ecosystem performance as a moderating variable.

        <p>Organizational culture, as a set of basic assumptions that guide decision-making (Schein, 1984), influences the operationalization and results of corporate strategy, which includes the adoption of OI strategies (Appleyard and Chesbrough, 2016). To date, most publications in the OI literature dealing with organizational culture have focused on the notinvented-here (NIH) and not-sold-here (NSH) syndromes (Armellini et al., 2018;Burcharth et al., 2014;Tranekjer and Knudsen, 2012;Chesbrough, 2003). However, as some recent articles on OI in the Brazilian context highlight, the incidence of these syndromes in this context is very low (Armellini et al., 2014), and signs of opposite phenomena have even been found (Bogers et al. 2021). Therefore, we consider it timely to use the OC cultural types proposed by Cameron and Quinn (2006) to analyze OC in this context, which has yielded interesting results.Organizational culture, as a set of basic assumptions that guide decision-making (Schein, 1984), influences the operationalization and results of corporate strategy, which includes the adoption of OI strategies (Appleyard and Chesbrough, 2016).

        <p>Our research framework proposed 12 hypotheses, of which 9 were confirmed. The results indicate that adhocracy culture is the OC type that most influences the adoption of inbound and outbound OI flows. This finding, while reinforcing the work of Cameron and Quinn (2006), which suggested that this type of OC is the one that best responds to turbulent conditions, is also in line with recent findings in the literature (Leal-Rodríguez et al., 2015;Naranjo-Valencia and Sanz-Valle, 2016;Wiener et al., 2018;Leal-Rodríguez et al., 2019), which have indicated that adhocracy culture tends to favor innovation and openness. Using the theoretical lens of the KBV, this result suggests that in order to intensify OI, these companies should privilege mechanisms for creating, transferring and sharing knowledge and fostering creativity as an aspect of OC. Characteristics of OC commonly observed in Brazil, such as collectivism and flexibility (Chu and Wood Jr, 2008;Hofstede et al., 2010), tend to favor tacit methods of transferring knowledge, which can boost the development of adhocracy culture.Our research framework proposed 12 hypotheses, of which 9 were confirmed.

        <p>Additionally, the findings also show that the clan organizational culture type positively affects inbound and outbound flows, which also reinforces findings from the literature on innovation management (Naranjo-Valencia and Sanz-Valle, 2016;Wiener et al., 2018). In this sense, it is important to highlight that personalization, as a characteristic of OC in Brazilian companies (Chu and Wood Jr, 2008), is also aligned with the clan-type culture. It is also important to note that these two types of OC (adhocracy and clan), which most influence the adoption of OI in companies operating in Brazil, have characteristics that generally encourage collaborative work between employees (such as teamwork, adaptability, flexibility and creativity), which also tends to boost the transfer of knowledge among employees (Pereira and Mohiya, 2021) and improve the innovation process (Ghosh and Srivastava, 2021).Additionally, the findings also show that the clan organizational culture type positively affects inbound and outbound flows, which also reinforces findings from the literature on innovation management (Naranjo-Valencia and Sanz-Valle, 2016;Wiener et al., 2018).

        <p>Market culture has been shown to influence only inbound and not outbound OI. Due to the cultural characteristics of emphasizing transactions with the external environment and being focused on the consumer (Cameron and Quinn, 2006;Golden and Shriner, 2019), we expected that this type of culture would also significantly influence outbound OI, which was not supported by the results. Additionally, the aggressive context that characterizes the competitive dynamics of companies that typically adopt this kind of organizational culture could make companies less prone to sharing and, consequently, prone to higher levels of the so-called 'Not-Shared-Here syndrome', which negatively affects outbound OI (Burcharth et al., 2014). These two factors may explain this result, but this needs to be confirmed in future studies.Market culture has been shown to influence only inbound and not outbound OI. Due to the cultural characteristics of emphasizing transactions with the external environment and being focused on the consumer (Cameron and Quinn, 2006;Golden and Shriner, 2019), we expected that this type of culture would also significantly influence outbound OI, which was not supported by the results.

        <p>Our results also indicate that the adoption of inbound OI influences innovative performance, and that improved results arising from the performance of the innovation ecosystem positively moderate the relationship between inbound OI and innovative performance. This finding, relating to companies operating in this Brazilian sample, converges with findings from the extant literature on OI, which has shown companies seeking external knowledge and technologies to improve the innovation process (e.g., Bianchi et al., 2016;Kim et al., 2016), as well as to improve the outcomes of knowledge management (Alavi et al., 2005).Our results also indicate that the adoption of inbound OI influences innovative performance, and that improved results arising from the performance of the innovation ecosystem positively moderate the relationship between inbound OI and innovative performance.

        <p>Thus, collaborative relationships with other companies, clients, suppliers, universities, consultants, research institutes and even competitors (Laursen and Salter, 2006;Rauter et al., 2019), conducted with the aim of bringing in new ideas, innovations, and technologies, can improve the innovation process.Thus, collaborative relationships with other companies, clients, suppliers, universities, consultants, research institutes and even competitors (Laursen and Salter, 2006;Rauter et al., 2019), conducted with the aim of bringing in new ideas, innovations, and technologies, can improve the innovation process.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, in the sample surveyed here, there was no significant relationship found between outbound OI and innovative performance. This result may be explained by the fact that Brazilian companies gain access to cutting-edge technology mainly through the licensing of technologies, acquisition of imported capital goods, payment of royalties for the use of imported technologies and acquisition of external R&amp;D (Negri, 2018). That is, this type of company in Brazil is usually more oriented toward inbound than outbound OI.On the other hand, in the sample surveyed here, there was no significant relationship found between outbound OI and innovative performance.

        <p>By presenting and analyzing OI and organizational culture in companies operating in a dynamic Brazilian industrial sector, the results of this research can provide new insights and generate new debates in management and innovation management. Our findings have a number of theoretical and practical implications, which are discussed below.By presenting and analyzing OI and organizational culture in companies operating in a dynamic Brazilian industrial sector, the results of this research can provide new insights and generate new debates in management and innovation management. Our findings have a number of theoretical and practical implications, which are discussed below.</p>
        <p>First, we can highlight that the theoretical model developed and tested in this research is original and makes contributions to the theory of OC, KBV, and OI. The results of this research framework, which has been tested and analyzed with companies in Brazil, may also be useful to broaden the debate on OC and innovation in emerging countries. Thus, our results meet the call of Giannetti and Rubera (2020) for the expansion of studies on innovation in emerging and territorially large countries, such as Brazil.First, we can highlight that the theoretical model developed and tested in this research is original and makes contributions to the theory of OC, KBV, and OI.

        <p>Our findings reinforce the assertion that adhocracy is the type of organizational culture that normally presents the best results in terms of innovation and, at the same time, that hierarchy culture tends to inhibit the practices of inbound OI. Thus, our results also reinforce the importance of promoting elements to strengthen the adhocratic OC type, such as stimulating internal entrepreneurship and creativity. In this sense, it is also important to note that these OC elements tend to encourage knowledge sharing (Pereira and Mohiya, 2021), strengthening innovation activities (Ghosh and Srivastava, 2021) and consequently OI.Our findings reinforce the assertion that adhocracy is the type of organizational culture that normally presents the best results in terms of innovation and, at the same time, that hierarchy culture tends to inhibit the practices of inbound OI.

        <p>We also observed that inbound OI flow significantly influences innovative performance, which is still positively moderated by the performance of the innovation ecosystem. On the other hand, there was no significant relationship found between outbound OI and innovative performance. This result can be explained by the absence of a significant internal R&amp;D tradition among Brazilian companies (Armellini et al., 2014;Negri, 2018;Bogers et al., 2021) and among emerging economies in general (Li and Kozikhode, 2009), as companies operating in these contexts tend to absorb more technology and knowledge from the external environment (via inbound OI) than effectively making technologies and knowledge developed internally available to the market (via outbound OI).We also observed that inbound OI flow significantly influences innovative performance, which is still positively moderated by the performance of the innovation ecosystem.

        <p>Even outside the context of emerging economies, it can be observed that studies which propose to compare the adoption of practices in both directions generally find less significant results relating to outbound flows (e.g., Burcharth et al., 2014;Armellini et al., 2018;Bogers et al., 2018;Wikhamn and Styhre, 2019). One potential explanation for this fact is that it is known that outbound OI is less prominent than inbound. Moreover, what can be inferred about research in this field is that outbound OI presents a great opportunity for a few companies (usually large companies), which have a technological surplus that can be applied beyond the boundaries of their own business models and sectors, but it is not a practice that is usually widely employed by most companies (for example, smaller companies with fewer technological resources). This would explain the difficulty of capturing the benefits of outbound innovation in quantitative surveys that cover a more general population of companies. However, although this research did not find significant relationships between outbound OI and performance in general, significant results were found in relation to the clan and adhocracy types of organizational culture and outbound OI, which in itself is a contribution to the literature.Even outside the context of emerging economies, it can be observed that studies which propose to compare the adoption of practices in both directions generally find less significant results relating to outbound flows (e.g., Burcharth et al., 2014;Armellini et al., 2018;Bogers et al., 2018;Wikhamn and Styhre, 2019).

        <p>Our results show that companies that aim to adopt or improve their OI practices, and consequently their innovative performance, should primarily pursue the characteristics of the adhocracy organizational culture. Thus, it is important that managers encourage habits and values among employees that boost entrepreneurship, creativity, and risk taking. Moreover, adhocratic OC tends to be the most suitable for situations involving technological, environmental and sectoral changes (Leal-Rodríguez et al., 2019). Organizational characteristics present in clan culture (for example, teamwork, and employee involvement) were also favorable for the adoption of OI, and can also guide the work of managers interested in improving the innovation process. Thus, knowledge conversion efforts that prioritize externalization (Gray and Densten, 2005), as well as intensified knowledge exchange interactions between employees of the same company and with external stakeholders (Lopes and Esteves, 2013), can also be useful to strengthen innovation-oriented OC types.Our results show that companies that aim to adopt or improve their OI practices, and consequently their innovative performance, should primarily pursue the characteristics of the adhocracy organizational culture.

        <p>Furthermore, strengthening positive environments, organizational openness, and collaborative work are OC recommendations that favor both KBV and OI. We suggest, therefore, that these aspects of OC should be understood and analyzed by managers who aim to improve innovative and OI performance.Furthermore, strengthening positive environments, organizational openness, and collaborative work are OC recommendations that favor both KBV and OI.

        <p>Our results also indicate that inbound OI efforts are important for improving innovative performance. Thus, collaboration with external organizations for the acquisition of technologies and for obtaining intellectual property, for example, can be useful for obtaining benefits such as an increase in market share and the results of the development of products and services. At the same time, management efforts that intensify collaboration with the actors present in the innovation ecosystem (such as universities, customers, suppliers, and research centers) tend to strengthen the relationship between inbound OI and innovative performance;Our results also indicate that inbound OI efforts are important for improving innovative performance.

        <p>this is another management recommendation that emerges from this research. Furthermore, efforts to develop knowledge management can also benefit absorptive capacity, which can improve OI outcomes.this is another management recommendation that emerges from this research.

        <p>One implication for public policy makers that emerges from the results of this study is that if governments need to identify ways to optimize their resources to support innovation, it is important to also prioritize those organizational cultures which are most conducive to innovation, which in the case of this study was found to be the adhocratic type. In this way, and specifically in the case of Brazil or other countries with similar characteristics, it is relevant that, together with other analysis mechanisms normally used in decision-making in public policies for innovation (such as the company's ability to develop high-tech products, potential for collaboration among companies and universities, development of environmental technologies and industry 4.0), models such as Cameron and Quinn (2006), which aim to accurately identify the dominant OC type in companies, are also adopted.One implication for public policy makers that emerges from the results of this study is that if governments need to identify ways to optimize their resources to support innovation, it is important to also prioritize those organizational cultures which are most conducive to innovation, which in the case of this study was found to be the adhocratic type.

        <p>Our results also suggest that the government can play an important role as a driver of innovation ecosystems, since they can boost and coordinate the sharing and transfer of knowledge and technologies between different actors present in the same ecosystem (such as companies, suppliers, universities and research institutes). As our findings suggest, this effort can assist firms' inbound open innovation and, at the same time, strengthen innovative performance. In addition, government incentives that support the transfer and sharing of companies' knowledge and technologies abroad can also foster outbound flows and thereby enhance the benefits of OI.Our results also suggest that the government can play an important role as a driver of innovation ecosystems, since they can boost and coordinate the sharing and transfer of knowledge and technologies between different actors present in the same ecosystem (such as companies, suppliers, universities and research institutes).

        <p>This research has certain limitations which should be addressed. For example, the sample and the respondent profiles are limitations which must be recognized. Future studies could expand such investigations regarding OC and OI into other industrial sectors and other countries. It would be interesting to compare the results of this study with similar research in countries that have national and organizational cultures which are significantly different from the Brazilian context.This research has certain limitations which should be addressed.

        <p>Considering that companies do not possess only one type of OC and that culture is a dynamic aspect (Cameron and Quinn, 2006), we did not identify, under the scoring model suggested by Cameron and Quinn (2006), the predominant OC type among the companies surveyed (adhocracy, clan, market, and hierarchy), but rather adapted this model for the purposes of this research. Future studies could investigate, in companies that predominantly possess each of these types of OC, the main practices, barriers, and incentives for the adoption of inbound and outbound OI. Future studies could also analyze the relationships between OC and OI using other management theories, such as social exchange theory or social network theory. Finally, studies on organizational change could investigate and propose ways in which companies can gradually modify their organizational culture toward practices that favor innovation.Considering that companies do not possess only one type of OC and that culture is a dynamic aspect (Cameron and Quinn, 2006), we did not identify, under the scoring model suggested by Cameron and Quinn (2006), the predominant OC type among the companies surveyed (adhocracy, clan, market, and hierarchy), but rather adapted this model for the purposes of this research.
