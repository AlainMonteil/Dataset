        <p>Lean Management (LM) is an efficiency-oriented socio-technical management system whose main purpose is to eliminate any source of waste through the simultaneous reduction or minimization of the sources of internal and external variability (Womack, Jones, and Roos 1990;Shah and Ward 2007). The systematic reduction of these sources of variability at both the company level and throughout the supply chain enables business results to be improved and provides the ability to achieve a competitive advantage (Womack and Jones 1996;Moyano-Fuentes and Sacristán-Díaz 2012).Lean Management (LM) is an efficiency-oriented socio-technical management system whose main purpose is to eliminate any source of waste through the simultaneous reduction or minimization of the sources of internal and external variability (Womack, Jones, and Roos 1990;Shah and Ward 2007).

        <p>On one hand, Supply Chain Management (SCM) has been used for planning and control of physical and information flows, internal and external logistics activities, and processes with other companies, and to address the relationship developed and the processes shared with customers and suppliers (Chen and Paulraj 2004;Kache and Seuring 2014). In recent years, SCM has come to be considered a key factor for increasing companies' efficacy and competitiveness (Frohlich and Westbrook 2001;Ataseven and Nair 2017). So, a suitable SCM strategy enables improvements to operating results in terms of greater efficiency in processes, a lower level of inventory, higher customer satisfaction, better quality, cost reductions, and improved delivery (Christopher and Towill 2000). This, along with an increase in global competitive pressure, has led to Lean principles spreading to the supply chain level with a view to optimizing interorganizational processes from the point-of-view of the end customer (Swenseth and Olson 2016). This has given rise to what is known as Lean Supply Chain Management (LSCM). LSCM consists of organizations directly linked by upstream and downstream flows of goods, services, finances, and information that work together to reduce costs and waste by efficiently and effectively pulling what is required to meet the needs of individual customers (Vitasek, Manrodt, and Abbott 2005;Swenseth and Olson 2016;Moyano-Fuentes, Bruque, and Maqueira 2019).On one hand, Supply Chain Management (SCM) has been used for planning and control of physical and information flows, internal and external logistics activities, and processes with other companies, and to address the relationship developed and the processes shared with customers and suppliers (Chen and Paulraj 2004;Kache and Seuring 2014).

        <p>However, supply chains are facing several challenges, such as uncertainty, costs, complexity, and vulnerability. Supply chains must be smart to overcome these issues and equipped with a technological infrastructure that enables information and physical flows to be integrated into supply chain processes (Abdel-Basset, Manogaran, and Mohamed 2018). In this line, supply chain is undergoing a digital transformation commonly referred to as Industry 4.0 (I4.0) driven by the emergence of advanced Information and Digital Technologies (IDT) (Ghobakhloo 2019). Information and Digital Technologies (IDT) of I4.0 refers to the application of a set of technologies related to digital transition whose scope extends beyond organizational boundaries and involves intelligent supply chain and connected customers (Gilchrist 2016;Ghobakhloo 2018). So, IDT of I4.0 includes the application of e-commerce tools such as Electronic Data Interchange (EDI); the adoption of Advanced Manufacturing Technologies (AMT) such as Computer Aided Design (CAD), Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM), Computer Aided Engineering (CAE), Industrial Simulation, and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP); and the most advanced IDT such as the Internet of Things (IOT), Augmented Reality (AR), Additive Manufacturing, Blockchain, Cloud Computing, and Big-Data analytics (Gilchrist, 2016;Lu, 2017;Ghobakhloo, 2019).However, supply chains are facing several challenges, such as uncertainty, costs, complexity, and vulnerability.

        <p>Several studies find a positive link between LSCM strategy adoption and improved efficiency both-at the internal level-of the commercial sectors involved in the strategy and-at the external level-of the supply chain as a whole (Marodin et al. 2017;Tortorella, Miorando, and Marodin 2017). However, IDT also enhance efficiency and reliability when applied to intra-and interorganizational processes (Da Xu, He, and Li 2014;Pfohl, Yahsi, and Kurnaz 2016). So, the concurrent implementation of LSCM and IDT of I4.0 has been demonstrated to be a complementary and synergistic strategic initiative. In this synergistic effect, LSCM is a change in company mentality compared to SCM and it also makes specific principles and practices available for firms to apply.Several studies find a positive link between LSCM strategy adoption and improved efficiency both-at the internal level-of the commercial sectors involved in the strategy and-at the external level-of the supply chain as a whole (Marodin et al. 2017;Tortorella, Miorando, and Marodin 2017).

        <p>For its part, I4.0 digital transition would enable a greater level of flexibility and automatization to be achieved in processes which would make it easier to apply these LSCM practices, and so raise efficiency in the entire supply chain. For this reason, IDT of I4.0 have the ability to enable Lean principles and practices to be extended throughout the entire Supply Chain (Tortorella and Fettermann 2018;Rossini et al. 2019;Tortorella, Miorando and Cawley 2019). It has also been observed that firms and supply chains that aspire to be among the top I4.0 levels must simultaneously implement IDT of I4.0 and LSCM to support the improvement process (Sanders, Elangeswaran, and Wulfsberg 2016;Pinho and Mendes 2017;Buer, Strandhagen, and Chan 2018;Rossini et al. 2019).For its part, I4.0 digital transition would enable a greater level of flexibility and automatization to be achieved in processes which would make it easier to apply these LSCM practices, and so raise efficiency in the entire supply chain.

        <p>Despite the IDT of I4.0-LSCM complementary effect and the multiple studies that analyze a range of digital transition-related aspects in the LSCM context, there is no literature review that presents the current situation of research on the interrelationships between IDT of 4.0 and LSCM. Literature reviews do exist that analyze the IT-Lean Management relationship at a more general level (Pinho and Mendes 2017) or the I4.0-Lean Management relationship at a more specific level (Buer, Strandhagen, and Chan 2018;Pagliosa, Tortorella, and Espindola-Ferreira 2019). In both cases, the focus is on LM at the internal level, not at the supply chain level. The aim of this study is, precisely, to cover this gap and the goal is to offer an overview of the current state of research on IDT of I4.0 in LSCM contexts. It also seeks to contribute a new literature classification with the research lines developed, their findings, the key aspects and implications of the IDT of I4.0/LSCM relationship, existing gaps, and paths for future research. For this, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) (Denyer and Tranfield 2009) will be conducted.Despite the IDT of I4.0-LSCM complementary effect and the multiple studies that analyze a range of digital transition-related aspects in the LSCM context, there is no literature review that presents the current situation of research on the interrelationships between IDT of 4.0 and LSCM.

        <p>On the one hand, the LSCM concept refers to the application and management of LM principles and practices in the supply chain to reduce costs and waste by efficiently and effectively pulling what is required to meet the needs of individual customers (Lamming 1996;Reichhart and Holweg 2007;Moyano-Fuentes, Bruque, and Maqueira 2019). The application and management of Lean principles and practices at the supply chain level is much more complex than LM application at the company internal level, as it entails the need for greater coordination and management of physical, information, and financial flows between the various agents involved (Moyano-Fuentes, Bruque, and Maqueira 2019).On the one hand, the LSCM concept refers to the application and management of LM principles and practices in the supply chain to reduce costs and waste by efficiently and effectively pulling what is required to meet the needs of individual customers (Lamming 1996;Reichhart and Holweg 2007;Moyano-Fuentes, Bruque, and Maqueira 2019).

        <p>Meanwhile, digitalization is defined as the use of computer and Internet technology for a more efficient and effective economic value creation process (Reddy and Reinartz 2017). Digitalization is not only changing business processes and company products but also the processes of the entire supply chain. It is leading to major changes in what has come to be called the digital transformation (Horváth and Szabó 2019). In digital transformation, Internet technologies, and the connectivity that they enable, play a core role in the deployment and use of more traditional IT and of more innovative or emerging IT (Ghobakhloo 2018;Ghobakhloo 2019). This joint use of different technologies, using the connectivity that the Internet allows, has given rise to the concept of Information and Digital Technologies (IDT) (Ghobakhloo 2018;Ghobakhloo 2019) and the digitalization concept is strongly linked to intensive IDT use in the creation of business value (Ivanov, Dolgui, and Sokolov 2019). Applying IDT in the manufacturing industry to raise efficiency and efficacy has sparked its digital transformation and the coining of the term Industry 4.0 (I4.0) (Kagermann, Wahlster, and Helbig 2013;Lee et al. 2018). Digitalization can be considered an over-arching concept and I4.0 a sub-concept (Horváth and Szabó 2019). The term I4.0 was introduced at the 2011 "Hannover Messe" to be precise and since 2013 (the year in which the "Industrie 4.0 Working Group" final report was published) has been fashioned into a technological framework (Kagermann, Wahlster, and Helbig 2013) that embraces a wide variety of technologies, principles, and methods to make production systems and supply chains more autonomous, dynamic, flexible, and precise (Tortorella and Fettermann 2018). Emerging digital technologies such as Cloud Computing, Big-Data, and the Internet of Things (IoT), inter alia, coexist in I4.0 alongside more traditional technologies such as, for example, Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM), a type of AMT (Monostori et al. 2016). These technologies are currently integrated in the so-called Cyber-Physical System (CPS) that links the virtual and physical worlds by establishing smart factories (Kang et al. 2016;Monostori et al. 2016;Strozzi et al. 2017). I4.0 is marked by highly developed automation and digitization processes and the use of electronics and information technologies in manufacturing (Lu 2017). IDT of I4.0 (Ghobakhloo 2018;Ghobakhloo 2019) allows processes to be integrated at both the intraorganizational and the interorganizational levels and provides a set of solutions that meets the growing needs for company informatization and automatization (Xu, Xu, and Li 2018) under a smart factory paradigm in which machines interact with each other (Ivanov et al. 2015;Strozzi et al. 2017). In addition, IDT of I4.0 enables information integration throughout the supply chain and the realtime transmission and processing of information for decision-making (Subramani 2004;Novais, Maqueira, and Ortiz-Bas 2019).Meanwhile, digitalization is defined as the use of computer and Internet technology for a more efficient and effective economic value creation process (Reddy and Reinartz 2017).

        <p>In line with the current followed by a number of other authors, in this study all the IT applied and used in industry to achieve efficacy and efficiency in conjunction with the connectivity provided by the Internet are considered to be IDT of I4.0 (Drath and Horch 2014;Ghobakhloo 2018;Frank, Dalenogare, and Ayala 2019;Ghobakhloo 2019). This article specifically spotlights the application of IDT of I4.0 in LSCM contexts.In line with the current followed by a number of other authors, in this study all the IT applied and used in industry to achieve efficacy and efficiency in conjunction with the connectivity provided by the Internet are considered to be IDT of I4.0 (Drath and Horch 2014;Ghobakhloo 2018;Frank, Dalenogare, and Ayala 2019;Ghobakhloo 2019).

        <p>Although there are no previous SLR studies that focus on LSCM and IDT of I4.0, SLRs exist that analyze the relationship between LM at the internal level and general IT usage (Pinho and Mendes 2017) and LM at the internal level and I4.0 in particular (Buer, Strandhagen, and Chan 2018;Plagiosa, Tortorella, and Espindola-Ferreira 2019).Although there are no previous SLR studies that focus on LSCM and IDT of I4.0, SLRs exist that analyze the relationship between LM at the internal level and general IT usage (Pinho and Mendes 2017) and LM at the internal level and I4.0 in particular (Buer, Strandhagen, and Chan 2018;Plagiosa, Tortorella, and Espindola-Ferreira 2019).</p>
        <p>With respect to the Lean-IT relationship, the results of an analysis of the existing literature show that the greatest consensus and empirical support can be found for the interdependence between the two concepts, i.e., a complementary or synergistic relationship exists between the two (Pinho and Mendes 2017). With respect to Lean-I4.0, the results of the analysis of the existing literature also highlight that this relationship has a complementary or synergistic effect (Buer, Strandhagen, and Chan 2018). Delving further into these works, there is a clear majority of studies that find that IDT of I4.0 act as a support mechanism for LM (Karre et al. 2017;Wagner, Herrmann, and Thiede 2017) with only a token number of studies that have found the opposite effect, i.e., that LM acts as a support to IDT of I4.0 use (Wang et al. 2016). Moreover, the literature stresses that when IDT of I4.0 and LM manifest themselves in conjunction with one another, the impact that this joint effect has on business results is greater (Ma, Wang, and Zhao 2017;Sanders, Elangeswaran, and Wulfsberg 2017;Tortorella and Fettermann 2018). The literature (Plagiosa, Tortorella, and Espindola-Ferreira 2019) clearly states that the intensity of the synergistic effect of this complementary or synergic relationship depends on the specific Lean practices and the specific technologies used (Plagiosa, Tortorella, and Espindola-Ferreira 2019). As such, the mid-high synergistic effect predominates among the majority of internal-level LM practices and some specific IDT of I4.0, such as IoT, CPS, Cloud Computing, Big-Data, and horizontal/vertical integration technologies (web technologies); whereas a mid-low synergistic effect predominates among more the usual internal-level LM and some other IDT of I4.0, such as Robotics, Augmented Reality (AR), Simulation and AdditiveWith respect to the Lean-IT relationship, the results of an analysis of the existing literature show that the greatest consensus and empirical support can be found for the interdependence between the two concepts, i.e., a complementary or synergistic relationship exists between the two (Pinho and Mendes 2017).

        <p>The results presented above and the greater complexity entailed in the use of Lean at the Supply Chain level mean that it is coherent to think that, as in the case of I4.0-internal LM, the IDT of I4.0-LSCM relationship is also complementary and synergic. It would be interesting to dig deeper into the results found in the literature on the I4.0-LSCM relationship in order to shed more light on this, scrutinizing the specific role played by specific types of IDT of 4.0.The results presented above and the greater complexity entailed in the use of Lean at the Supply Chain level mean that it is coherent to think that, as in the case of I4.0-internal LM, the IDT of I4.0-LSCM relationship is also complementary and synergic.

        <p>The applied methodology is SLR. This is a method that enables the location, selection, and evaluation of the contributions that the literature has made to a research topic. The main advantages of this method that can be highlighted are that it guarantees a structured, repeatable, and scientific process that enables existing information to be synthesized in a rigorous and objective process (Tranfield, Denyer, and Smart 2003;Denyer and Tranfield 2009). SLR has been implemented successfully in the area of Operations Management (Morgan and Gagnon 2013;Cherrafi et al. 2017), in SCM (Glock, Grosse, and Ries 2017;Bastas and Liyanage 2018), and in the I4.0 context (Liao et al. 2017;Machado, Winroth, and Ribeiro da Silva 2019;Pagliosa, Tortorella, and Espindola-Ferreira 2019).The applied methodology is SLR.

        <p>This step is essential as, if the selected literature is inadequate, inappropriate or irrelevant, the contribution of the following phases will be amiss (Sangwa and Sangwan 2018). There are two key aspects in this stage: the choice of search engines and the choice of search word strings (Tranfield, Denyer, and Smart 2003;Denyer and Tranfield 2009). The search engines used should correspond to the typical databases in the area of study (Okoli and Schabram 2010;Thomé, Scavarda, and Scavarda 2016;Durach, Kembro, and Wieland 2017). The search words strings must allow precise results to be found, with no false positives or false negatives (Tranfield, Denyer, and Smart 2003;Denyer and Tranfield 2009).This step is essential as, if the selected literature is inadequate, inappropriate or irrelevant, the contribution of the following phases will be amiss (Sangwa and Sangwan 2018).

        <p>In the specific case of this research, the most relevant databases in the area of study have been used as the search engines, i.e., 
            <rs type="software">Web</rs> of 
            <rs type="software">Science</rs> (WoS), Scopus, and ABI/Inform, as these are the databases that are usually used in SLRs in Operations Management. Using more than one database to locate the literature helps to prevent any relevant studies being missed and reduces any possible publication bias (Thomé, Scavarda, and Scavarda 2016;Durach, Kembro, and Wieland 2017).
        </p>
        <p>The research objective, in this case, is in the area where the IDT of I4.0 set, the Lean Management set, and the Supply Chain Management set intersect. The search chains were therefore specifically designed to locate documents in this intersection area (see Figure 1). For this, the search strings have been constructed by combining the most representative key search words for each of the three mentioned sets. The key search words should be sufficiently broad so as not to restrict the number of studies but sufficiently specific to locate only studies related to the topic (Thomé, Scavarda, and Scavarda 2016;Durach, Kembro, and Wieland 2017). Therefore, the key search words were determined jointly by the researchers, established experts in IDT and LSCM, in a brainstorming session.The research objective, in this case, is in the area where the IDT of I4.0 set, the Lean Management set, and the Supply Chain Management set intersect.

        <p>The search string has then been constructed using logical and Boolean operators. The design of the search string seeks to ensure that the located articles contain at least one of the key search words for each of the three blocks (IDT of I4.0, Lean Management, and Supply Chain) either in the title, abstract or document author's keywords (in the case of Scopus and ABI/Inform) or more broadly in the topic (in the case of WoS; title, abstract, author's keywords, expanded keywords). The key search words used in these search strings have been honed down with multiple pilot tests in the three databases in order to prevent any hits on false positives or false negatives and to ensure the identification of relevant papers (Denyer and Tranfield 2009;Durach, Kembro, and Wieland 2017). Bearing that the search engines present differences in the syntax that they use for searches, the specific form of these search strings had to be adapted to each of the databases used. Some of the key search words considered in the pilot tests were later eliminated to cut down the length of the search strings, given that individual searches using these terms individually did not yield any valid results.The search string has then been constructed using logical and Boolean operators.

        <p>The purpose of the third step is to discard any studies that are not relevant. This is achieved by defining some criteria that establish the studies that should be considered in the review (inclusion criteria) and those that should be discarded with no further scrutiny (exclusion criteria) (Denyer and Tranfield 2009;Okoli and Schabram 2010).The purpose of the third step is to discard any studies that are not relevant.

        <p>The criteria established in this phase should be explicit and substantiate the exhaustiveness of the resulting review. It is also necessary to establish which studies do not have sufficient quality so that they can be excluded from the review (Okoli and Schabram 2010). Application of these criteria eliminates articles that clearly do not belong in the review and those that could be included are selected. The chosen articles are then evaluated. For this, the abstracts are reviewed to confirm the inclusion of the studies that comply with the established search criteria (Denyer and Tranfield 2009;Thomé, Scavarda, and Scavarda 2016).The criteria established in this phase should be explicit and substantiate the exhaustiveness of the resulting review.

        <p>In this research, the search was limited to works published in English between 1996 and December 2019. The beginning of the search period corresponds to the first publication on LSCM (Lamming 1996). The search was limited to the research areas of the study (business economics, business, management and accounting, economics, econometrics and finance, decision sciences, computer science, automation control systems, engineering, environmental science, multidisciplinary, operations research management science, transportation, and logistics) and areas that were clearly not related were not considered. Only articles, articles in press and reviews published in journals indexed in the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) and/or SCImago Journal Rank (SJR) were considered to ensure the quality of the selected works. In addition, in the case of the ABI/Inform database, it was possible to select only peer-reviewed studies. These inclusion and exclusion criteria were agreed upon by the researchers, which prevents any bias that might be associated with a single decision-maker (Thomé, Scavarda, and Scavarda 2016).In this research, the search was limited to works published in English between 1996 and December 2019.

        <p>With the application of the above-mentioned inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 1,188 publications were selected out of the 3,829 initially identified. Duplicate papers found in the databases were subsequently eliminated, giving rise to a set of 798 studies.With the application of the above-mentioned inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 1,188 publications were selected out of the 3,829 initially identified.

        <p>WoS was taken as the reference database for the detection of duplicate papers and the papers identified in Scopus that had already been identified in WoS were duly eliminated (253 exclusions).

        <p>The next step was to evaluate the articles, which entailed examining the title, the abstract and the keywords. This enabled the articles to be determined that were clearly related and those that were clearly not related to the research question. Articles were discarded that clearly did not have any links to the research question, which gave rise to a total of 108 articles. In a second step, in cases found that were not conclusively related, the theoretical framework, the main results, and the conclusions were read and, when necessary, the entire article (Thomé, Scavarda, and Scavarda 2016;Durach, Kembro, and Wieland 2017). As good SLR practices in Operations Management and IS advocate, article selection and evaluation was conducted jointly by the researchers in an interactive review process. The level of agreement was high and any discrepancies were discussed and solved (Okoli and Schabram 2010;Thomé, Scavarda, and Scavarda 2016), eliminating in this way all single researcher bias. At the end of this phase, a total of 73 papers were selected for detailed analysis and synthesis (step 4).The next step was to evaluate the articles, which entailed examining the title, the abstract and the keywords.

        <p>The next step has been to review and analyze each of the selected articles by reading them in their entirety. Pre-defined structured coding of the information has been done in this phase in order to mine the relevant details in each of the studies and enable researcher involvement in this process (Denyer and Tranfield 2009;Thomé, Scavarda, and Scavarda 2016) and so reduce all single researcher bias (Thomé, Scavarda, and Scavarda 2016).The next step has been to review and analyze each of the selected articles by reading them in their entirety.

        <p>Forward and back searches were done to ensure a full and exhaustive literature review and new articles were identified by means of the snowballing effect (Okoli and Schabram 2010;Thomé, Scavarda, and Scavarda 2016). Five new articles were detected as a result of examining the references used in the articles selected in step 3 (forward search) and the references in these papers (back search) (snowballing effect) and added to those identified in direct database searches, with a final total of 78 articles eventually obtained.Forward and back searches were done to ensure a full and exhaustive literature review and new articles were identified by means of the snowballing effect (Okoli and Schabram 2010;Thomé, Scavarda, and Scavarda 2016).

        <p>As commented, 78 articles were identified that fulfilled the established criteria and, therefore, contributed to explaining the literature on the interrelationships between IDT of I4.0 and LSCM and responding to the specific research questions proposed.

        <p>Considering TLC in the classification is important for companies because time is a major variable associated with IDT and, in LSCM contexts, the use that organizations can make of it to achieve a competitive advantage depends on the position that IDT occupy in the TLC. As such, even though their effect is uncertain due to their novelty, emerging IDT may represent a competitive advantage, especially when they become critical (key) to an organization. Mature IDT tend to be staples or widespread in a sector and so are no longer generators of competitive advantage, although their use is a strategic requirement just to be able to compete. Obsolete IDT are already being discarded in the sector.Considering TLC in the classification is important for companies because time is a major variable associated with IDT and, in LSCM contexts, the use that organizations can make of it to achieve a competitive advantage depends on the position that IDT occupy in the TLC.

        <p>(1) SL1.1, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) in LSCM EDI is a technology that emerged prior to the Internet reaching the business domain. Its use has currently been adapted to web environments (EDI-web) or it is used as a legacy system integrated into more up-to-date IS (van der Aalst 1999; Medjahed et al. 2003;Witte, Grünhagen, and Clarke 2003).(1) SL1.1, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) in LSCM EDI is a technology that emerged prior to the Internet reaching the business domain.

        <p>EDI has had a strong impact on the Supply Chain and its efficiency (LSCM objective) from the very beginning as it contributed to improving communication between customers and suppliers, business partners and organizations at a time when the Internet did not exist (Evans, Naim, and Towill 1993). EDI enables large volumes of information to be sent at a much greater speed than in paper form and reduces costs, delays, and errors (Abernathy et al. 2000), which is in line with LM objectives at the supply chain level. In general terms, EDI has enabled companies to make faster decisions and bring down waiting times by reducing the time needed to send information, thus contributing to the goal of more efficient supply chains (Mason-Jones and Towill 1997). In particular, EDI has allowed the level of inventory to be brought down and control of replenishment to be had throughout the entire Lean supply chain, which has enabled companies to work with smaller lots and pull system demand management (Abernathy et al. 2000;McMichael, MacKay, and Altmann 2000;Danas, Ketikidis, and Roudsari 2002).EDI has had a strong impact on the Supply Chain and its efficiency (LSCM objective) from the very beginning as it contributed to improving communication between customers and suppliers, business partners and organizations at a time when the Internet did not exist (Evans, Naim, and Towill 1993).

            <rs type="version">1</rs>, Barcode systems in LSCM Barcode systems have contributed to achieving LSCM objectives by enabling the automatic generation, capture, and sending of information from one supply chain member to another, thus rendering the supply chain more efficient. So, for example, barcode systems are used in retail to automate the payment process, thus reducing labor costs and the opportunity for check-out errors (Abernathy et al. 2000). Using these systems standardizes information exchanged between different chain agents and so enables physical, information, and financial flows to be integrated. This brings down costs, eliminates errors and wastage, and, therefore, increases supply chain efficiency (Abernathy et al. 2000). Standardization also provides a tool to collect real-time demand information and to share this with suppliers/customers, thus producing better coordination between Lean Supply Chain (LSC) members (McMichael, MacKay, and Altmann 2000). For example, the use of these systems was a determinant of the transformation of hospital pharmacy supply chains thanks to the benefits that it provides to merchandise flows and inventory control, and less wastage (Danas, Ketikidis, and Roudsari 2002).

        <p>They provide greater integration than other systems such as barcodes, as RFID overcomes many of the latter's limitations, such as incorrect readings when the barcode is damaged or incorrectly positioned. It has, therefore, been found that RFID A concern for key aspects of RFID implementation in LSCM has also been observed in the literature. Huang et al. (2012) develop a platform that eliminates technological barriers to RFID implementation and enables its use in operations by all members of an LSC, thus enabling the traceability and visibility of materials and reducing the bullwhip effect. Dai et al. (2012) stress the way that RFID devices should be deployed to collect and interpret information and conclude that their proper implementation enables data to be processed in real-time, thus reducing the time needed for decision-making (Dai et al. 2012, Huang et al. 2012, Moon et al. 2018).

(2012) stress the way that RFID devices should be deployed to collect and interpret information and conclude that their proper implementation enables data to be processed in real-time, thus reducing the time needed for decision-making (Dai et al. 2012, Huang et al. 2012, Moon et al. 2018). The economic performance of RFID implementation in LSCM has also been verified thanks to a reduction in warehousing costs that can be achieved through the use of this IDT (Tsao, Linh, and Lu 2017).</p>

            <rs type="software">SL</rs>2.4, Workflow systems in LSCM Workflow systems are IS that allow the development of business processes (van der Aalst 1999). These business processes can be collaborative between organizations, in which case they act as a support for operations in the supply chain (Hsieh and Lin 2012). Workflow systems can achieve efficiency in supply chain processes by contributing to LSCM objectives. In this sense, Ma, Wang, and Xu (2011) propose the modeling and analysis of the interorganizational workflow through the use of Petri networks and the standardization of business processes in the LSCM context, enabling organizations to be more efficient and productive, optimizing resources and improving the service that they provide to their customers. Dallasega, Rauch, and Frosolini (2018) propose the use of workflow systems to break down large work orders into smaller, more controllable parts, which enables information to be collected in real-time throughout the entire supply chain and problems and their causes to be identified. This provides the ability to react rapidly to changes in customer demand and any errors identified to be improved. It also allows the inventory level to be reduced thanks to a reduction in delivery times and improved planning. So, LM objectives are achieved at the supply chain level (Dallasega, Rauch, and Frosolini 2018).

Organizations adopting JIT principles and practices for LSC are implementing ERP systems as these are designed to eliminate wastage in the information management process (Green, Whitten, and Inman 2007). In this research subline, Green, Whitten, and Inman (2007) uphold that an ERP system is required as part of the JIT strategy applied to the supply chain so as to provide all chain members with a common database. Information is managed in real-time and has a positive impact on the response capability and on delivery speed, reliability and flexibility, and customer satisfaction. All this has an impact on better organizational and supply chain results (Green, Whitten, and Inman 2007). Information availability is not usually a problem: it is the communication of this information that is ineffective (Bilalis et al. 2002). As a result, information can be presented visually, which makes it easier to interpret and communicate and so manage operations and processes in real-time (Parry and Turner 2006).

        <p>In the construction industry, specific management approaches and IDT tools are increasingly used in LSCM to maximize value and minimize waste (Deng et al. 2019;Meng 2019;Bortolini, Formoso, and Viana 2019). CAD/CAE AMT use in LSCM construction processes (Building Information Modeling or BIM) in conjunction with geographical information systems (GIS) provide solutions to support decision-making for supplier selection, for determining the number of deliveries and the allocation of consolidation centers in congested regions with long transportation distances (Deng et al. 2019). BIM CAD/CAE AMT encourages optimal supply chain collaboration during a construction project (Deng et al. 2019;Meng 2019). When BIM is applied in a project, a new culture is fostered in the project environment. As a result, better supply chain collaboration raises the possibility of improving LM construction practices (Meng 2019). Joint use of BIM CAD/CAE AMT and LSCM presents a synergistic effect that significantly improves delivery costs, increases the reliability of component delivery, increases productivity for site assembly of prefabricated building systems, keeps inventories organized on-site and reduces lead-time (Bortolini, Formoso, and Viana 2019).

        <p>IoT in LSCM contexts provides product visibility and traceability and, even more importantly, information integration (Xu et al. 2018;Wang et al. 2018). By adopting IoT-based technologies, buffer time, inventory level, productivity, re-work, and so on can all be easily identified and duly addressed (Wang et al. 2018). Implementing IoT among supply chain members enables real-time links and information sharing, thus improving interoperability between the main IS of different organizations (Dave et al. 2016;Wang et al. 2018). IoT allows the generation of Big-Data, resulting in significantly improved streamlining of operations (Roy and Roy 2019).

        <p>Given the challenges that the digital transition of I4.0 in LSCM poses, it would be necessary to conduct comparative research with empirical studies to determine whether From a more concrete perspective, VR has been used in LSCM environments as a learning tool. However, technologies such as Augmented Reality (AR) have not been analyzed in LSCM contexts. AR allows virtual information to be added to physical objects and has great potential for application in logistics activities such as warehouse management and distribution, for example, or for picking and packing and expediting delivery. In both cases, AR facilitates the efficient and rapid location of products. For this, conceptual studies and case studies could be conducted that evaluate this technology's use in LSCM environments. Its application would be beneficial for lastmile logistics processes and could drastically reduce the time devoted to searching for and finding physical goods. Other emerging IDT that have still not been explored in the research in LSCM contexts, such as Blockchain and Additive Manufacturing, could also greatly help Lean objectives be achieved in the supply chain. In this sense, it would be interesting to evaluate the capacity for innovation that might result from knowledge generated throughout LSCM due to the use of certain emerging IDT of I4.0. For example, it would be interesting to determine the potential of an emerging IDT such as Blockchain, which renders information unalterable, for achieving efficiency in information processing across a Lean supply chain.

        <p>The results obtained in this study are original and novel compared to the prior literature (Sony 2018;Pinho, and Mendes, 2017;Buer, Strandhagent, and Chan, 2018;Plagiosa, Tortorella, and Espindola-Ferreira 2019). Whereas previous SLR have analyzed the interrelationship between IT in general (Pinho, and Mendes 2017), or IDT of I.4 in particular (Buer, Strandhagent, and Chan, 2018;Plagiosa, Tortorella, and Espindola-Ferreira 2019), and LM applied on the internal level in a single organization (Pinho, and Mendes, 2017;Buer, Strandhagent, and Chan 2018;Plagiosa, Tortorella, and Espindola-Ferreira 2019), this is the first SLR that broadens the focus to the study of the IDT of I4.0-LM relationship at the supply chain level, and this is one of its main contributions.The results obtained in this study are original and novel compared to the prior literature (Sony 2018;Pinho, and Mendes, 2017;Buer, Strandhagent, and Chan, 2018;Plagiosa, Tortorella, and Espindola-Ferreira 2019).

        <p>What stands out in this new focus is the finding that several IDT of I4.0 are being used by companies in the supply chain as an aid to implement Lean practices (LSCM). This effect coincides with the effect that also stands out in the internal-level IT-Lean relationship (Pinho, and Mendes, 2017;Buer, Strandhagent, and Chan 2018;Sony 2018;). Nevertheless, as this paper shows, when extended to the supply chain, a large group of companies uses a large number of IDT of I4.0 and several Lean practices at the same time. The result is a strong accumulated effect on efficiency and, ultimately, on the supply chain results. So, for example, IoT use in LSCM usually occurs alongside the use of RFID, GPS, CPS, Cloud Computing and Big-Data, acting on several Lean practices and having a multiplying effect on the results.What stands out in this new focus is the finding that several IDT of I4.0 are being used by companies in the supply chain as an aid to implement Lean practices (LSCM).

        <p>Another of this paper's main contributions is, precisely, that it shows that the complementary or synergistic effect between IDT of I4.0 and LSCM is very strong and has a tremendous impact on the supply chain results (for example, some of the many benefits are flexibility, agility, information sharing, synchronization and collaboration, integration, coordination, speed, reduced costs, deliveries, and errors, reduced inventory levels, enabling a pull system, enabling traceability and inventory control, reduced risk, improved service quality, and customer satisfaction).Another of this paper's main contributions is, precisely, that it shows that the complementary or synergistic effect between IDT of I4.0 and LSCM is very strong and has a tremendous impact on the supply chain results (for example, some of the many benefits are flexibility, agility, information sharing, synchronization and collaboration, integration, coordination, speed, reduced costs, deliveries, and errors, reduced inventory levels, enabling a pull system, enabling traceability and inventory control, reduced risk, improved service quality, and customer satisfaction).</p>
        <p>This positive impact on the results has also been found in the joint use of IDT of I4.0 and internal LM (Buer, Strandhagent, and Chan, 2018;Plagiosa, Tortorella, and Espindola-Ferreira 2019). However, the novelty of this paper is that it has been proven that when IDT of I4.0 are applied at the LSCM level, the effect on the results is multiplied.This positive impact on the results has also been found in the joint use of IDT of I4.0 and internal LM (Buer, Strandhagent, and Chan, 2018;Plagiosa, Tortorella, and Espindola-Ferreira 2019).

        <p>The following sets out a series of implications that may be useful from an academic, management and policymaker focus. Regarding management implications, this paper can act as a reference on the relationship between the IDT of I4.0 and LSCM. Specifically, it shows the synergic and complementary effects of IDT of I4.0 and LSCM on performance. Thus, using this as a guide, Lean supply chain managers can increase internal and external (Lean supply chain partners) awareness, understanding, and acceptance of an LSCM 4.0 strategy with the main aim of improving mutual efficiency and effectiveness by their Lean supply chain partners triggering the adoption of an internal I4.0 strategy and/or moving forward in a digital transition towards LSCM 4.0. In fact, the lack of understanding of the implications of I4.0 and its expansion to the supply chain level, as well as a lack of knowledge about the potential benefits or uncertain outcomes of investments, have been identified as a challenge in SCM 4.0 research (Luthra and Kumar, 2018). Furthermore, the demonstrated relationship between IDT of I4.0 and LSCM via the TLC is a tool with strategic interest for managers and can act as an aid to making decisions on the use of some specific IDT of I4.0 in LSCM contexts when seeking to obtain competitive advantages, competing not individually, but at the supply chain level.The following sets out a series of implications that may be useful from an academic, management and policymaker focus.

        <p>Finally, there is no doubt about the crucial role that the Public Sector can play to ensure that I4.0 becomes a success at the internal and SC levels (Smit et al. 2016). In fact, a lack of weak government policy has been identified as one of the main barriers to the adoption of I4.0 in the SCM research field (Luthra and Kumar, 2018). In this regard, the main gaps and weaknesses identified by this research could be used as a reference to develop technological forecasting and policies for overcoming them and promoting a roadmap transition towards LSCM 4.0. Thus, this research humbly intends to act as a reference for policymakers.Finally, there is no doubt about the crucial role that the Public Sector can play to ensure that I4.0 becomes a success at the internal and SC levels (Smit et al. 2016).

        <p>It is important to remark that several studies on SCM 4.0 in general (e.g., Smit et al. 2016;Barata, Da Cunha and Stal, 2018;Ali et al. 2019) emphasize the lack of digital know-how, training, managers' awareness of IDT of I4.0 and their potential benefits, the investment capacity of certain supply chain partners (e.g., SMEs), the ability to run pilot projects at the supply chain level, standards, and interoperability concerns, cybersecurity problems, and legal conditions, among other relevant inhibitors or barriers. Therefore, Government policies (at the regional, national, and supranational levels) could support and fund research, coordinate I4.0 initiatives at the SCM level, develop platforms where best practices could be shared and lessons learned, raise awareness of challenges/opportunities, support the development of standards, enable SMEs to have access to funding or boost multidisciplinary consortia, among others.It is important to remark that several studies on SCM 4.0 in general (e.g., Smit et al. 2016;Barata, Da Cunha and Stal, 2018;Ali et al. 2019) emphasize the lack of digital know-how, training, managers' awareness of IDT of I4.0 and their potential benefits, the investment capacity of certain supply chain partners (e.g., SMEs), the ability to run pilot projects at the supply chain level, standards, and interoperability concerns, cybersecurity problems, and legal conditions, among other relevant inhibitors or barriers.

        <p>However, this could be considered as a minor limitation, as the use of various databases reduces publication bias (Thomé, Scavarda, and Scavarda 2016). In addition, using the inclusion criterion for papers published in JCR and/or SJR impact journals might have resulted in some other article of interest not being located. However, this is a criterion that is habitually used in SLR to ensure the quality of the articles (Schmeisser 2013;Vural 2017;Martinelli and Tunisini 2019). In other respects, SLR comes under criticism for the subjectivity of key search word selection and of the classification criteria used. But the involvement of several researchers and the consensus that they arrived at in the choice of key search words and the coding and classification of chosen articles reduces the subjectivity linked to single researcher bias (Thomé, Scavarda, and Scavarda 2016), with the use of research line and subline identification criteria being the norm for classification in SLR (Garza-Reyes 2015;Vural 2017). And yet, despite these limitations, we believe that this study provides a broad view of the IDT of I4.0 -LSCM relationship that can kindle thought and offer useful implications for other researchers to further explore some concrete aspects of the Industry 4.0 transition and LSCM.However, this could be considered as a minor limitation, as the use of various databases reduces publication bias (Thomé, Scavarda, and Scavarda 2016).

        <p>This paper has reviewed the extant literature on the interrelationships between IDT of I4.0 and LSCM. For this, an SLR has been conducted that has enabled the identification of articles of interest and a novel literature classification. TLC has been used as the grouping criterion to construct the classification, which has enabled the interrelationships between LSCM and the specific technologies to be understood according to their lifecycle position. Using the position of IDT of I4.0 in the TLC as a grouping criterion is important due to the consideration of time as a variable and the utility that it has as a tool for decision-making in the pursuit of competitive advantages.This paper has reviewed the extant literature on the interrelationships between IDT of I4.0 and LSCM.
