        <p>Developed to be interconnected by design, the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) and their 169 targets have attracted a growing scientific community committed to exploring the systemic interactions inherent to the 2030 Agenda. Understanding which SDGs influence one another (positively or negatively) is critical to prioritize and implement policies that maximize synergies between goals while navigating trade-offs. In this way, the need for informed decision-making urgently requires knowledge of context-specific SDG interactions. Drawing on an extensive literature review (including scientific reports and scholarly articles), we collected, synthesized, and analyzed data about negative and positive interactions among SDG goals and targets. Based on this unique dataset, our analysis focused on three key elements of the resulting network of SDG interactions: First, we identified the most dominant SDGs in the network. Second, we identified systemic multipliers, defined as nodes with higher weighted amounts of outgoing than incoming influence. Third, we identified critical sub-networks of strongly interconnected SDG targets, highlighting possible virtuous cycles that could serve as concrete entry points to realize the 2030 Agenda.Developed to be interconnected by design, the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) and their 169 targets have attracted a growing scientific community committed to exploring the systemic interactions inherent to the 2030 Agenda.

The present article relates to and builds on the existing literature on SDG interactions in three ways.</p>
        <p>First, many recent publications have stressed the need for sectoral integration (Biermann, Kanie, &amp; Kim, 2017;Griggs et al., 2014;Le Blanc, 2015;Scharlemann et al., 2020;Stafford-Smith et al., 2016), for working with nexus approaches (Avellán et al., 2017;Liu et al., 2018) and considering the SDGs as interacting elements rather than a mere sum of goals, targets, and indicators (Pradhan, 2019). Additionally, authors increasingly apply concepts from formal network analysis, for example, to highlight the imperfect interconnectedness among the goals (McGowan, Stewart, Long, &amp; Grainger, 2019) or to assess the variation of SDG interactions depending on countries' socio-economic status (Lusseau &amp; Mancini, 2019;Pradhan, 2019). Our analysis is aligned with recent studies aiming at understanding how to best prioritize policies that realize the SDGs by exploiting positive direct and indirect effects of specifically targeted measures (Dawes, 2020;Weitz, Carlsen, Nilsson, &amp; Skånberg, 2018). By adapting some concepts of Messerli (2000) to formal network analysis of directional interactions, we propose a methodology for identifying interconnected systemic buffers or multipliers. We further suggest alternative pathways that would maximize the leveraging potential of the 2030 Agenda, in particular by emphasizing highly connected subnetworks that could function as virtuous cycles.First, many recent publications have stressed the need for sectoral integration (Biermann, Kanie, &amp; Kim, 2017;Griggs et al., 2014;Le Blanc, 2015;Scharlemann et al., 2020;Stafford-Smith et al., 2016), for working with nexus approaches (Avellán et al., 2017;Liu et al., 2018) and considering the SDGs as interacting elements rather than a mere sum of goals, targets, and indicators (Pradhan, 2019).

        <p>Second, among existing studies on networks of SDGs, the approaches to pre-analysis data collection vary-in particular, two distinct departure points may be identified. In the first approach, researchers use national-level time series of SDG indicators to statistically infer positive or negative correlations between measured advances toward particular SDGs (Kroll, Warchold, &amp; Pradhan, 2019;Lusseau &amp; Mancini, 2019;Pradhan, Costa, Rybski, Lucht, &amp; Kropp, 2017;Zhou &amp; Moinuddin, 2017). The advantage of using data gathered by national statistical offices lies in that it effectively enables a disaggregation at country-level, or by socio-economic status, and potentially allows for analysis of complex, dynamic networks. However, the approach is often completed by more qualitative analyses due to the challenges and risks of inferring causal relationships between SDGs based solely on correlations between performance measures for certain indicators (Zhou &amp; Moinuddin, 2017). In the second approach, researchers assess causal and directional interactions among SDG targets based on the judgment of experts (Allen, Metternicht, &amp; Wiedmann, 2019;Ehrensperger, de Bremond, Providoli, &amp; Messerli, 2019;Grace et al., 2019;McGowan et al., 2019;Weitz et al., 2018). Usually, these analysts follow the recommendations of the International Science Council to use a seven-point scale scoring system (ICSU, 2017;Nilsson, Griggs, &amp; Visbeck, 2016), ideally reinforced with empirical evidence and explicit references to relevant literature (IPCC, 2018;Maes, Jones, Toledano, &amp; Milligan, 2019;McCollum et al., 2018). While also employing the "ICSU score," our analysis draws on a much larger evidence base than other studies-that is, on a comprehensive sample of publications on SDG interactions as reported in relevant reports and the academic literature. Results thus represent an unprecedented effort to start synthetizing and unveiling the abundant but fragmented body of knowledge on SDG interactions. Third, complementing previous network studies on SDGs, our approach is further distinct in that it assesses positive and negative interactions for each pair of SDG targets separately. Looking at prior analyses, we observed that assigning a mean weight to interactionsby combining positive and negative assessments-has a tendency to "dilute" understanding of the potential trade-offs. In our analysis, we chose to address positive and negative interactions separately, referring to them as "co-benefits" and "trade-offs," respectively.Second, among existing studies on networks of SDGs, the approaches to pre-analysis data collection vary-in particular, two distinct departure points may be identified.

        <p>Our chosen study approach aims at responding to calls for translation of factual knowledge on global phenomena into actionable implications in terms of policy, building on the normative framework provided by the SDGs. As Le Blanc (2015) states, policymaking on behalf of the 2030 Agenda must be "based on studies of the biophysical, social, and economic systems at appropriate scales".Our chosen study approach aims at responding to calls for translation of factual knowledge on global phenomena into actionable implications in terms of policy, building on the normative framework provided by the SDGs.

If the pursuit of one SDG impacts one part of the earth system, direct and indirect interactions with other subsystems may alter the available space for achievement of other SDGs (Avellán et al., 2017;Bouma, 2014;Cowie et al., 2011;Gain, Giupponi, &amp; Benson, 2015).(b) interactions occurring at the level of the allocation of resources for SDG-specific actions; and (c) systemic interactions between socialecological systems that have unintended consequences for other SDGs.

        <p>For example, if agricultural production is intensified with chemical fertilizers, the additional yields can provide co-benefits in terms of local food security as well as increased trade activities. At the same time, however, excessive use of fertilizer may degrade water quality downstream and cause significant health harms within a distant community.For example, if agricultural production is intensified with chemical fertilizers, the additional yields can provide co-benefits in terms of local food security as well as increased trade activities.

        <p>Under business-as-usual scenarios, policymakers tend to prioritize achieving their separately considered goals, making interventions at resource level that bring about unintended effects in the socialecological world. By contrast, pursuing policy coherence to implement the SDGs implies an inverted approach: first, seeking to understand dynamics and interactions in social-ecological systems; only then, considering their normative implications in terms of SDG governance, that is, how to allocate various capacities and financial resources.Under business-as-usual scenarios, policymakers tend to prioritize achieving their separately considered goals, making interventions at resource level that bring about unintended effects in the socialecological world.

The next section on methodology explains our selection criteria for sources of information as well as our coding rules and procedure. This section also details our methods for analysis of the dominance of particular goals and interactions, for identification of the systemic role of goals, and for assessment of systemic reinforcing loops across the entire SDG network. The subsequent section on results and analysis presents an overview of the SDG interactions as well as more detailed individual findings. Finally, our concluding section summarizes the main findings, critically reflects on our approach, and suggests important avenues for further research.By "SDG interactions," we refer in this study to systemic level interactions (cf.

        <p>We undertook a systematic literature review emphasizing identification and summary of negative and positive influences of individual goals on other goals-at the target level, wherever possible, and otherwise at the SDG level. All told, we assembled and assessed a comprehensive corpus including 65 UN flagship reports and international scientific assessments as well as 112 scientific articles. Taken together, this "body of knowledge" enabled us to make evidencebased judgments of SDG interactions, which were codified, scored, and entered into a centralized database (Pham-Truffert, Rueff, &amp; Messerli, 2019).We undertook a systematic literature review emphasizing identification and summary of negative and positive influences of individual goals on other goals-at the target level, wherever possible, and otherwise at the SDG level.

        <p>Within the corpus reviewed, the chosen global assessment reports mainly comprise major global scientific assessments (e.g., IPCC, IPBES) and a selection of flagship reports from the UN system, reflecting a variety of fields of expertise (e.g., UNCTAD, UNESCO). In addition, we extracted peer-reviewed articles based on a query search on ISI Web of Science and Scopus' databases. In order to obtain a manageable set of relevant articles, we decided to limit the selection to the papers matching the keywords "SDG" and "interaction," or very close synonyms (cf. 1. Query search in the Appendices). In early 2018, the total number of items we exported in this manner from Web of Science and Scopus is 366. After merging the duplicates, we had still 231 publications left, and after erasing the documents comprised in the selection but with "SDG" being an acronym for something else than "Sustainable Development Goal," 176 publications were left for us to review.

        <p>Building on the protocol in Nilsson et al. (2018), we codesigned and tested coding guidelines using the seven-point scale scoring framework (cf. Table 1). Specifically, we assessed interactions at the target level whenever possible, and at more generic SDG level otherwise, considering all the 126 SDG targets that were not Means of implementation (MoI)-thus ignoring the "lettered" targets in the 2030 Agenda. A total of eight coders read the articles and reports and systematically filled in an

At the SDG level, we aggregated all the coded data independent of their level of precision, for example, an interaction between target 2.3 and target 1.2 would simply be coded as an interaction between SDG 2 and SDG 1.

        <p>The degree centrality of a node is a straightforward measure used in SNA and defined as the number of ties belonging to a given node (Freeman, 1978). In a weighted network, the measure can also account for the weight of the ties (Opsahl, Agneessens, &amp; Skvoretz, 2010). Hence, we define the node centrality as:The degree centrality of a node is a straightforward measure used in SNA and defined as the number of ties belonging to a given node (Freeman, 1978).

To check whether the overall systemic roles of the SDGs differ when these "popularity effects" are eliminated, we reproduced the analysis with normalized network data in the Appendices (cf. 2. Analysis after normalization). To this end, we down-weight the ties in the network through a normalization process. Using the average activity normalization proposed in Leifeld, Gruber, and Bossner (2018), we divide the interactions' weights by the mean of the popularity of the two connected nodes (i.e., SDGs) in question. The popularity of an SDG would equal the number of coded entries of interactions extending from that given SDG.In this way, some SDGs have a higher "popularity" than others in our data, and these popular goals automatically have higher chances of exhibiting interactions with many other goals.

        <p>Our results confirm the view of other studies that co-benefits outweigh trade-offs in terms of interaction types (Dawes, 2020;Pradhan et al., 2017;Weitz et al., 2018). Nevertheless, some interactions have significant negative-impact shares (in red). For instance, there appear to be important trade-offs between pursuit of climate (SDG 13) and ocean (SDG 14) goals, based, for example, on risks of coastal squeeze when trying to protect coasts from sea-level rise (ICSU, 2017). Further, many interactions relate to the so-called waterenergy-food (WEF) nexus, a topic that was cited repeatedly in the literature. Indeed, we see that the share of negative interactions (in red) is larger between specific goals. In particular, we see that pursuit of food (SDG 2) and energy (SDG 7) goals can cause significant trade-offs with other SDGs, especially water (SDG 6) and ecosystems (SDG 15). Overall, we found that energy (29%) and food (21%) generated half of the assessed trade-offs. This relates, for instance, to competition over use of cultivable land surfaces (e.g., for biofuels or food production) as well as to land-based degradation and ecosystem pollution.

        <p>Our network analysis reveals the twofold role of the SDGs as multipliers and buffers of co-benefits and trade-offs, giving rise to various policy implications. Based on the current state of knowledge embodied in international scientific reports, UN flagship reports, and selected scientific papers, our analysis shows that SDG 1 (poverty), SDG 3 (health), SDG 5 (gender), and SDG 10 (inequality) are predominantly systemic buffers. These goals can benefit from sound implementation of the other goals of the agenda. However, if all efforts are focused on these "buffer" SDGs, the co-benefits and multiplication effects on behalf of the 2030 Agenda will be very limited from a systemic perspective. On the other hand, SDGs 2 and 8 on food and economic growth must be approached carefully, as these goals can act as multipliers of trade-offs. A rapid boost of these goals could bring about unintended side effects and hinder progress toward achievement of the overall agenda. At the same time, several goals can act as multipliers and accelerators of change, in particular SDGs 7 (energy), SDG 9 (innovation), SDG 11 (cities), and SDG 13 (climate).Our network analysis reveals the twofold role of the SDGs as multipliers and buffers of co-benefits and trade-offs, giving rise to various policy implications.

        <p>The experience of coding interactions derived from a systematic literature review revealed the difficulty of identifying precise context-specific interactions capable of informing technological or governance solutions and addressing specific geographic and temporal scales. We found that the available knowledge on interactions has an inherent bias toward global perspectives and generally lacks regional or country-specific differentiation. A great deal of additional knowledge exists, but it currently remains fragmented and relatively inaccessible on behalf of the sciencepolicy-society interface. In terms of sustainability issues, the available body of knowledge may also have a bias toward environmental rather than social perspectives. Indeed, disciplines focused on gender or health, for instance, do not appear to have undertaken assessments of SDG interactions in their studies to date.The experience of coding interactions derived from a systematic literature review revealed the difficulty of identifying precise context-specific interactions capable of informing technological or governance solutions and addressing specific geographic and temporal scales.

        <p>To overcome these shortcomings, a joint initiative by the scientific community has called for creation of a knowledge platform (Nilsson et al., 2018) incorporating context-specific case studies that can inform the global policy process and support key science-based assessments, such as the Global Sustainable Development Report (GSDR). Such initiatives would increase the relevance of science for sustainable development and improve the science-policy interface (Messerli et al., 2019).To overcome these shortcomings, a joint initiative by the scientific community has called for creation of a knowledge platform (Nilsson et al., 2018) incorporating context-specific case studies that can inform the global policy process and support key science-based assessments, such as the Global Sustainable Development Report (GSDR).
