        <p>ICT alters both teaching and learning by adding active elements to the academic environment and is considered as a powerful tool for providing academic services. Nowadays, researchers think that the educational system is capable of improving only when ICT is implemented. At schools, colleges and universities, the staff use technology to execute their duties including technical, office, managerial, administrative, etc. Computer literacy is one of the basic skills when applying for a lecturer's position besides teaching qualifications and skills. Thus, we can state that ICT has contributed much to improving general conditions of the academic environment [26].ICT alters both teaching and learning by adding active elements to the academic environment and is considered as a powerful tool for providing academic services.

        <p>During testing, students are provided with cards with QR-codes (https://www.pli ckers.com/PlickersCards_2up.pdf) containing response options A, B, C, and D (Fig. 1). After reading a question, students raise a card with a chosen response scanned by a teacher's mobile device. After scanning QR-codes of the cards, the data from the teacher's mobile device is transmitted to the Plickers cloud where they are processed and stored.

        <p>Combination of various ways of data presentation is the core of the multimedia learning theory developed by R.E. Mayer who distinguishes four cognitive processes -choice, arrangement, transformation and integration of data [30, p. 118]. Selected text and graphical data are processed separately first. Next, selected data are arranged into two separate models for word and graphical data. While being processed, word data can be transformed into graphical ones (for example, by building mental images) and vice versa (by using internal verbalization of images). To successfully accomplish multimedia learning, both models should be integrated and associated with previously acquired knowledge [30].Combination of various ways of data presentation is the core of the multimedia learning theory developed by R.E.

        <p>1. The multimedia principle: people learn by words and images better than by words only. 2. The space vicinity principle: people learn better when corresponding words and images go together and not far from each other on a page or screen. 3. The time adjacency principle: people learn better, when corresponding words and images go simultaneously and not in succession. 4. The coherence principle: people learn better, when irrelevant words, images and sounds are off and not on. 5. The modality principle: people learn better by using animation and narration than by animation and a screen text. 6. The excessiveness principle: people learn better by using animation and narration than by animation, narration and a screen text. 7. The personalization principle: people learn better, when words are presented in spoken language than in formal one. 8. The interactivity principle: people learn better, when they control the presentation pace. 9. The signalization principle: people learn better, when words contain markers on presentation arrangement. 10. The principle of individual distinctions: multimedia effects affect low-level students better than high-level ones. Multimedia effects are more powerful for highly professional students than for low-professional ones.1. The multimedia principle: people learn by words and images better than by words only. 2.
