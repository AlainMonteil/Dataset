        <p>AI and innovation, we performed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of published work indexed in the Clarivate Web of Science (WOS) and Elsevier Scopus databases (the final sample includes 1448 articles). A bibliometric analysis was deployed to map the focal field in terms of dominant topics and their evolution over time. By deploying keyword co-occurrences, and bibliographic coupling techniques, we generate insights on the literature at the intersection of AI and innovation research. We leverage the SLR findings to provide an updated synopsis of extant scientific work on the focal research area and to develop an interpretive framework which sheds light on the drivers and outcomes of AI adoption for innovation. We identify economic, technological, and social factors of AI adoption in firms willing to innovate. We also uncover firms' economic, competitive and organizational, and innovation factors as key outcomes of AI deployment. We conclude this paper by developing an agenda for future research.</p>
        <p>Technological innovation developments in organizations have been the object of increasing scholarly attention over the last few decades as firms have rapidly discovered how to use technology to enhance their innovativeness and performance (Beilin et al., 2019;Bai and Li, 2020;Hoffman et al., 1988;Musiolik et al., 2020). More specifically, organizations have soon learned that they can blend innovative technologies with their capabilities to enhance their competitive advantage (Porter, 1985). Among digital technologies that are allowing firms to constantly innovate in the digital age, there is artificial intelligence (AI) which is increasingly affecting how firms innovate (Kakatkar et al., 2020;Mariani and Fosso Wamba, 2020;Wamba and Mishra, 2017) and how consumers respond to AI-informed innovations (Mustak et al., 2021).</p>
        <p>Economists have recently tried to make sense of the impact of AI on innovation (Cockburn et al., 2019), and they have called for more research at both the industry and organizational level. So far, management scholars dealing with technology-driven innovation have focused mainly on themes such as the barriers in the implementation of AI systems in organizations (Desouza et al., 2020;Haefner et al., 2021), and ways through which AI can support organizational processes (Frank et al., 2019), decision making (Kakatkar et al., 2020;Verganti et al., 2020), operations (Belhadi et al., 2021), business models (Di Vaio et al., 2020) and the achievement of organizational objectives (Hutchinson, 2021). While this body of research is very recent, it apparently displays several features: (1) it seems rather fragmented; (2) its nature is mostly exploratory; (3) innovation scholars do not have a clear, holistic, and comprehensive picture of what has been researched and where are the most relevant new research gaps that might provide fruitful avenues for further enquiry in the focal domain.</p>
        <p>More specifically, despite AI being increasingly critical in innovation studies, so far, no systematic effort has been made to synthesize and assess comprehensively and quantitatively through a systematic literature review (SLR) the knowledge produced on the role of AI in innovation management. Furthermore, innovation management scholars miss a structured framework clearly mapping out extant literature in relation to the drivers and outcomes of AI adoption in the innovation field. To bridge these research gaps, and in line with tenets of literature review research (Donthu et al., 2021) we carry out a SLR to answer the following research question: "What is the emerging intellectual structure of the innovation literature dealing with AI?"</p>
        <p>To answer this research question, we conduct a SLR to identify the evolution of research in the field of AI in innovation, investigate the scientific knowledge produced so far and portray advancement of innovation research pertaining to AI. After having identified the relevant sample of the review (N = 1448 articles), we use a SLR approach also to identify the drivers and outcomes of AI adoption for innovation purposes. Adopting a SLR allows to embrace a systematic, transparent and reproducible approach which is capable of diminishing researchers' bias (Snyder, 2019).</p>
        <p>This paper makes several contributions to the area at the intersection of innovation and AI by adopting a multidisciplinary perspective. First, we provide an updated overview of the volume and trend of research outputs at the intersection of AI and innovation, thus contributing to the technology innovation management field. Second, we single out economic, technological, and social factors as drivers of AI adoption in firms willing to innovate. Third, we identify firms' economic, innovation, competitive and organizational factors as key outcomes of AI adoption in firms aiming to innovate. Fourth, we leverage a bibliometric analysis to uncover seminal work in the field of AI in innovation research and to map the research field over time. Fifth, we contribute to the innovation literature by developing an interpretive framework which sheds light on the drivers and outcomes of AI adoption for innovation, thus offering a theoretical contribution to the technology innovation management field. Sixth, we identify the most frequently used theories to provide clear directions for further inquiry. Seventh, we develop a rich research agenda that contributes to expand the perimeter of the field, while revealing new research gaps that can lead to fruitful avenues for further enquiry in the focal field.</p>
        <p>The article is structured as follows. In section 2, we review the recent debate on AI in the innovation domain. Section 3 describes the methodology adopted in this study. Section 4 portrays the findings in relation to the descriptive statistics of extant publications, major themes and topics that emerged from the bibliographic coupling analysis, theoretical lenses deployed in the literature, and a comprehensive framework to identify drivers and outcomes of AI adoption. Section 5 elucidates the major contributions. Section 6 illustrates the limitations, while developing a rich research agenda. Section 7 draws synthetically the conclusions.</p>
        <p>As the aim of this study is to map the intellectual structure of innovation literature dealing with AI, we first introduce several key concepts and definitions to better inform this systematic literature review.</p>
        <p>There seems to be general scholarly consensus that the first description of AI appeared in science fiction almost eight decades ago. In 1942 American science fiction writer Isaac Asimov published his book Runaround where a robot was developed by the engineers Gregory Powell and Mike Donavan paying attention to the so called "Three rules" of robotics. In a relatively short time, Asimov's book became a source of inspiration for many scientists, especially in the fields of computer science and robotics. At roughly the same time, the English mathematician Alan Turing worked for the British government on a supercomputer (The Bombe) to break the Enigma code used by the German army during WWII (Haenlein and Kaplan, 2019). This experience was conducive in the fifties to the production of an article describing how to create intelligent machines and test their intelligence. Apparently, the circumlocution Artificial Intelligence was officially coined in 1956 when American cognitive scientist Marvin Minsky and computer scientist John McCarthy hosted the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence (DSRAI) at Dartmouth College, USA. Since then, AI and its relevance have recorded many ups and downs and currently AI technologies are reaching a peak of inflated expectations (Gartner, 2019).</p>
        <p>A number of scholars in business and management has recognized that AI has multiple ramifications. These ramifications have been theorized recently by Davenport and Ronanki (2018) and Huang and Rust (2018). For instance, Davenport and Ronanki (2018) distinguish three types of AI: process automation, cognitive insight and cognitive engagement. More recently, AI has been defined as "the use of computational machinery to emulate capabilities inherent in humans, such as doing physical or mechanical tasks, thinking, and feeling" (Huang and Rust, 2021, p.31). In innovation contexts, AI has been defined as systems developed with the "objective of creating human-like behaviour in machines for perception, reasoning, and action" (Prem, 2019, p.2). AI has gained power due to rapid advances in computational capabilities and a huge variety of new technologies (e.g., computer vision, machine learning, and natural language processing) (Mariani et al., 2022), as well as a blast of available data to train algorithms (Bornet et al., 2021).</p>
        <p>The increasing relevance of AI in innovation is witnessed by the production of several studies on topics such as AI supporting innovation analytics (Kakatkar et al., 2020), AI enabling digital experimentation and digital innovation (Mariani and Nambisan, 2021), AI and sustainable business models (Di Vaio et al., 2020), AI in supply chain management (Toorajipour et al., 2021), strategic uses of AI (Borges et al., 2021), AI and big data integration within business processes (Wamba and Mishra, 2017), and AI capabilities in industrial markets (Akter et al., 2021). However, to the best of our knowledge, there is only one literature review focusing on AI within innovation: Haefner et al. (2021) review the literature on AI and innovation management using the behavioural theory of the firm to identify the application of AI systems in the innovation process, and illustrate the challenges that firms may face during the innovation process.</p>
        <p>Our study is unique and distinctively different compared to the only existing literature review on AI and innovation management (Haefner et al., 2021) for a number of reasons. First, our study embraces a bibliometric and quantitative approach to examine the relevant literature, whereas Haefner et al. (2021) adopted a narrative approach. Second, the work of Haefner et al. (2021) is confined to "innovation management", while our study captures holistically the way AI has been researched in innovation studies. Third, bibliometric techniques allowed us to dig in depth about several key topics, and to portray the scholarly debate on the drivers and outcomes of AI adoption by firms trying to pursue product, process, and business model innovation.</p>
        <p>As such, this work makes the following contributions. First, to the best of our knowledge, our study is the first (or among the first) to conduct a SLR on AI in the wider innovation research context (without a mere focus on innovation management) and to provide an integrated and holistic view of this emerging research area. Second, we leverage on several bibliometric techniques (e.g., citation analysis, co-citation analysis, bibliographic coupling, co-word analysis) as well as network analysis to scrutinize the intellectual structure emerging from the literature, and, subsequently, provide a comprehensive framework which sheds light on the drivers and outcomes of AI adoption for innovation. Third, we single out and examine the wide range of theoretical lenses adopted in this research area to enable a better theoretical and conceptual interpretation of AI in innovation research.</p>
        <p>To develop an updated synopsis of existing research at the intersection of AI and innovation and evaluate quantitatively the literature, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR). SLRs are considered the appropriate tool to systematically assess and evaluate a given body of literature (Tranfield et al., 2003). We deployed a SLR method over other literature review methods for a number of reasons: first, SLRs are more objective than narrative literature reviews (Tranfield et al., 2003); second, SLRs allow to produce holistic conclusions stemming from a detailed, transparent and planned process that enable reproducibility (Cubric, 2020;Snyder, 2019;Williams et al., 2020); third, SLRs entail the adoption of a quantitative approach that allows to identify where there is research, but also where there are research gaps (Snyder, 2019;Tranfield et al., 2003), thus helping generate robust research agendas to advance the field (Williams Jr. et al., 2020). Thus far, the SLR method has been largely adopted in the social sciences (Tranfield et al., 2003) and more specifically in the management literature (Cubric, 2020;Williams et al., 2020;Zupic and Čater, 2015), with the aim of presenting findings in a relevant and accessible manner to scholars and decision-makers (Tranfield et al., 2003;Williams Jr. et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>By following the SLR methodology proposed by Tranfield et al. (2003), andWilliams Jr. et al. (2020), data was gathered by collecting documents from two key databases: Scopus and Web of Science (WOS) (Christofi et al., 2021). These databases were chosen as they assemble a collection of the most important sources of academic research and scholarly articles in the social sciences field (Vieira and Gomes, 2009).</p>
        <p>The Elsevier owned and managed Scopus database is deemed one of the most complete scientific databases indexing research production across a myriad of academic disciplines. It covers more than 22,000 scientific publications from over 5000 international publishers (Mariani et al., 2022). The Clarivate owned Web of Science (WOS) Core Collection offers access to seven databases -Science Citation Index expand (SCIE), Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (AHCI), Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI), Conference Proceedings Citation Index (CPCI), Book Citation Index (BKCI), and Current Chemical Reactions and Index Chemicus, starting from 1900. WOS references cross-disciplinary research covering over 28,000 journals from 3300 publishers with high criteria standards and rigorous protocols (Gaur and Kumar, 2018;Mustak et al., 2021;Vanhala et al., 2020). Both databases allow organizing and integrating data retrieved from different sources (i.e., articles, books chapters, conference papers) in any bibliographic format for each cited reference. Additionally, this embedding feature guarantees the scientific rigour, making this attribute valuable for bibliometric analysis (Mustak et al., 2021) establishing reliability, validity and relevance of the documents retrieved in both databases (Mariani et al., 2018). To support our choice to produce a robust, accurate and effective research we used the same set of terms/keywords to perform an initial advanced search in both Scopus and WOS databases, as presented in Fig. 1.</p>
        <p>Firstly, we identified multiple keywords based on recent (systematic) literature reviews and bibliometric studies focusing on artificial intelligence in the management and marketing field (see for instance Mustak et al., 2021). The keywords include "AI", "artificial intelligence", as well as keywords related to AI subfields and related enabling and supporting technologies and techniques such as "machine learning", "neural network*", "deep learning", "data mining". The Scopus database was searched by looking for combinations of the aforementioned AI-related keywords and "innovat*" in the title, abstract, or keywords (Williams et al., 2020;Christofi et al., 2021). This yielded 10,258 documents. In line with systematic literature reviews conducted elsewhere (Battisti et al., 2021;Christofi et al., 2021;Gaur and Kumar, 2018;Williams et al., 2020), we narrowed down our search considering only articles and review papers (Gaur and Kumar, 2018) in English language in the subject area (Christofi et al., 2021) of Business, Management and Accounting; Decision Science; Economics, Econometrics and Finance. This narrowed down the sample to 1272 articles. Secondly, we searched the WOS database core collection by employing the same combination of keywords previously used on Scopus to search publications. We also added the operator AND to confine the results to the area of Business, Management, Business Finance, Economics. This yielded 825 documents. We excluded all duplicates from our dataset (i.e., articles that were present in both databases were included only once in our final database), that led us to obtain a total of 1448 documents as our final sample. Finally, we retrieved the metadata for these 1448 articles which included author names, titles, country of corresponding author/s, total number of publications, citation counts (i.e., total citations, average article citations, and number of citing articles with and without self-citations), journal sources, keywords, and countries as well as institutional affiliations.</p>
        <p>This analysis and findings section is organized in several subsections. First, we present the descriptive analyses, followed by the bibliographic coupling and co-citation clusters analyses. Next, we elucidate the analysis of key co-occurrence and the temporal mapping of the central keywords. The final subsection reveals the findings related to the Fig. 1. Protocol details of this study.</p>
        <p>M.M. Mariani et al. theoretical lenses deployed to inform the literature field and the most used methodologies in the literature.</p>
        <p>In this section, we develop a descriptive analysis of the focal sample attained by means of our SLR queries. To achieve the aim of the analysis, we deployed the number of publications as a proxy of research productivity and the number of citations as a proxy of research impact.</p>
        <p>In order to identify the different theoretical perspectives that innovation scholars have used to inform their studies, the abstracts were analyzed searching for the keywords "theory" and "model" to identify the theories and models that the articles contributed to Mariani et al. (2022). In total, 730 articles mentioned a theory or a model in the abstract. From those articles, 164 different theories and models were identified, and Table 1 provides a summary of the 5 most frequently used theories organized by frequency of mention.</p>
        <p>The technological innovation systems (TIS) framework is a popular tool for researching the emergence and growth of new technological systems. Technological innovation systems structurally consist of actors and institutions, as well as how they interact with each other (Markard, 2020). The goal of technological innovation systems theory is to improve systems-design understanding of innovation processes and is widely used in processes of system building (Musiolik et al., 2012;Musiolik,2020).</p>
        <p>Fuzzy theories are useful in explaining multiple reasoning processes. Fuzzy set theory is the most common approach to deal with difficult, subjective, and imprecise assessments, and it is useful for measuring the textual attributes of available data. Using fuzzy set approach, Gubán et al. (2019) developed an empirically based model to measure innovation performance and sustainability innovation potential technology. A fuzzy set approach was also applied by Beilin et al. (2019) to forecast financial indicators to determine the degree of competitiveness and attractiveness of businesses. Serrano García et al. (2017) used a fuzzy inference diagnostic system for organisational capacities for innovation in order to design organisational strategies to improve organisational capabilities for innovation in a university. Alidrisi (2021) used a fuzzy analytical network (ANP) to prioritize the 5Vs in Big Data as a decision-making platform in order to apply green supply chain management practices and improve supply chain finance.</p>
        <p>The technology acceptance model (TAM) is one of the most popular models used to explain the antecedents of technology acceptance (Gao and Bai, 2014). According to TAM, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness are important factors in predicting user acceptance of a technology (Davis, 1989). Lancelot Miltgen et al. (2013) combined elements of technology acceptance model (TAM), diffusion of innovations (DOI) and unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) to investigate individual acceptance of biometric identification. Recently Chatterjee et al. (2021b) combined a TAM model with a technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework to identify factors influencing the adoption of Industry 4.0 and especially AI in manufacturing and production firms.</p>
        <p>Dynamic Capabilities theory is one of the most used theoretical lenses in management research to determine firms' strategies to adapt in a volatile environment. Dynamic capabilities allow firms to sense opportunities and threats, seize opportunities, and maintain competitiveness through reconfiguring the business assets and resources (Teece et al., 1997a(Teece et al., , 1997b)).</p>
        <p>Dynamic capabilities theory is based on firms' ability to develop, integrate and restructure internal and external capabilities to enhance their competitive advantage (Teece, 2020). Warner and Wäger (2019) investigate how incumbent firms in traditional industries build dynamic capabilities for digital transformation. Based on senior executives' experiences with leading digitalization projects (including AI projects) at incumbent firm, they develop a model to uncover the factors that cause, facilitate, and obstruct the creation of dynamic capabilities for digital transformation. Recently, Gallego-Gomez and De-Pablos-Heredero (2020) combined dynamic capabilities theory and resource-based view approach to investigate the implementation of AI systems in the banking sector. The used approach was useful to determine how firms can build managerial skills focused on saving costs, increasing efficiency, customer satisfaction and competitive advantage.</p>
        <p>The diffusion of innovation theory explains how new ideas, technology, or products developments ramp up and spread over time within a target community (Rogers, 2003). Diffusion innovation theory is widely used in information technology (IT) topics. Wang and Swanson (2007) investigate the launch of an information technology -professional service automation -to develop a framework of institutional entrepreneurship for launching IT innovations. To investigate factors determining firms' intention to adopt Big Data Analytics (BDA) in logistics and supply chain, Lai et al. (2018) combined diffusion theory with th technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework to assess 210 organizations intentions to adopt BDA. An exemplary empirical study from Butt et al. (2021) combined innovation diffusion theory, technology acceptance model, and flow theory in order to explore the roles of perceived easiness, usefulness, advantage, compatibility, enjoyment, customization, and interactivity of the gamers' intention to play with AI-powered avatars.</p>
        <p>To provide an overview of the different methodologies adopted in the studies in our systematic literature review, the abstracts were analyzed searching for the relevant keywords in relation to the type of methodology in the articles. As clear from Table 2, most of the studies (39%) in our database adopted an empirical quantitative approach; 35% are conceptual studies; 24% of the studies deployed an empirical qualitative approach; and 2% entail literature reviews. We also found 2 studies using a mixed methods research design and both focus on IoT topic. Table 2 provides an overview of the most used methodological approaches.</p>
        <p>We mapped the evolution of publications on the topic of AI in innovation field over time until November 2021. Fig. 2 shows the frequency distribution of studies in AI in innovation studies over time. The growing number of published studies related to artificial intelligence in innovation, especially in recent years, is reflective of the increasing academic interest in the AI field. However, in line with other literature reviews conducted recently, it seems that we are still at the early stages of research (Di Vaio et al., 2020;Mariani et al., 2022Mustak et al., 2021).</p>
        <p>Relevant literature was produced in the field of AI in innovation in the '80s and specifically with a publication in Futures in 1981. Two years later a new article was published in Long Range Planning. In the '90s around 3 to 4 papers were published, recording a rise in the number of publications by the end of 1999. This trend continued in the first years of 2000s. Additionally, the number of publications tripled around the year 2007 with an exponential growth in the number of publications in the following years. While we did not manage to cover entirely 2021 (at the moment of writing), more than 280 articles were published in 2021.</p>
        <p>In terms of geographical distribution, our queries retrieved publications from multiple countries. The top 5 countries in terms of number of publications are illustrated in Table 3. The US dominates the ranking with 227 documents (and 5968 citations), followed by China (151 publications), Italy (125 publications), Germany (123 documents), and the United Kingdom (119 publications). This geographical distribution appears to reflect the countries' technological achievements, which may be driven by large-scale government funding and national industrial policies that encouraged investments in Industry 4.0 technologies in general and AI in particular (Mariani et al., 2022).</p>
        <p>The growing number of publications is spread across a broad variety of research outlets. The journals publishing most of the research on AI and innovation are represented in Fig. 3. Technological Forecasting and Social Change is the outlet hosting the highest share of articles ( 159), with the first publication in 1994.</p>
        <p>One of the first articles at the intersection of AI and innovation was published in 1981 on the topic of Innovation, automation and the long-wave theory, by Rod Coomb, in Futures. The number of publications increased in the ensuing years. After 2004, we can detect a rise in the number of published articles, with ten articles published in diverse research outlets. After 2012, the number of published articles almost quadruples in number (33) reaching the top with 117 publications in 2017. In 2021, more than 280 articles have been published to date by the time of writing this paper.</p>
        <p>In recent years, a growing number of literature review articles have employed bibliometric analysis to measure and map (multidisciplinary) research, and identify knowledge gaps in the social sciences and the management field (Zupic and Čater, 2015). Bibliometric analysis is widely used as a set of analytical techniques and methods to identify leading authors and seminal work (Donthu et al., 2021), and identify and map novel research trends (Mariani and Borghi, 2019). In Table 4, we list the methods used to perform our bibliometric analysis.</p>
        <p>To map the knowledge revolving around AI in innovation studies we used the 
            <rs type="software">VOSviewer</rs> (Version 
            <rs type="version">1.6.17</rs>) software as it is an open free software that enables researchers to conduct bibliometric data analysis easily. The use of free software contributes to the transparency, reliability and replicability of the research (Antons et al., 2020).
        </p>
        <p>To explore the connections of leading researchers in the field, to identify the status of the present knowledge, to identify the most influential publications leading the field we deployed bibliographic coupling by co-citations network and journal co-citation analysis. By analysing connecting documents often cited together in another publication through bibliographic coupling we can assume thematic similarity, allowing to illustrate the intellectual structure of a research field (Donthu et al., 2021). This methodology provides a robust and objective scientific analysis for science mapping (Donthu et al., 2021;Mariani et al., 2022) reducing the risk of biases.</p>
        <p>To identify the relationships among cited publications to understand the evolution of fundamental themes we developed co-citation clusters. Bibliometric maps and graphical representations (Van Eck and Waltman, 2010) were developed. To identify existing relationships between topics and concepts by connecting words across the literature pool we employed Keyword co-occurrence analysis. To map how topics and concepts evolve in the literature over time, we mapped central keywords over time. To identify the conceptual/theoretical base of the research focuses on the literature we deployed density visualization.</p>
        <p>The advancement of scientific research is deeply connected with the recognition of the work of other scientists that can take the form of citations. Accordingly, techniques such as bibliographic coupling are particularly relevant to capture this form of recognition. In particular, bibliographic coupling is based on the assumption that two or more publications that share common references are related as far as their content is concerned (Donthu et al., 2021). Bibliographic coupling represents a robust technique to illustrate how a new research stream is evolving over time (Mariani and Borghi, 2019;Mariani et al., 2022;Zupic and Čater, 2015). Table 5 depicts the most prominent researchers that have examined AI in innovation studies.</p>
        <p>The journal bibliographic coupling and co-citation analyses allow identifying the journals hosting the highest share of publications in the focal area (Zupic and Čater, 2015). Fig. 4 illustrates the bibliographic coupling network between leading academic journals with articles in AI in innovation and displays the dominance of several international journals such as Technological Forecasting and Social Change, Journal of Cleaner Production, Journal of Business Research, Research Policy, and Technovation.</p>
        <p>For the co-citation cluster analysis, we identified semantic similarities based on citation connection across the reference lists to measure publications' influence. Publications cited together are similar in their content, and deal with core themes and concepts. These prominent publications contribute to the development of the research on AI in innovation over time (Donthu et al., 2021). A co-citation analysis represents a reliable technique to make sense of the connections among documents in the reference lists across publications in a literature base (Zupic and Čater, 2015). When a co-citation network is constructed at the level of cited reference, its can allow to identify the connection of the semantic similarities network useful to uncover seminal work (Donthu et al., 2021). Fig. 5 depicts the authors network in the literature of AI in innovation. In line with other bibliometric work in the social sciences, we consider by default articles with a minimum of 50 citations of a cited reference in the literature pool. This produced seven clusters from our sample of 1448 documents.</p>
        <p>The identified clusters reveal the knowledge foundations of the most influential publications and thematic similarities (Donthu et al., 2021) in the field on AI in innovation research.</p>
        <p>Cluster 1 (in green) includes studies on servitization and industry 4.0, smart tourism, IoT and dynamic capabilities. Cluster 2 (in dark blue colour) includes studies about smart cities and open innovation. Cluster 3 (in light blue) consists of studies pertaining to innovation systems and networks in technological innovation. Studies in cluster 4 (red colour) revolve around technology forecasting and technological opportunities. Cluster 5, in purple colour, entails mostly studies on knowledge management, open innovation and technological change. Cluster 6, in orange colour, includes studies linked to customer acceptance of digital technologies. Last. Cluster 7 (yellow) includes studies on green innovation and supply chain.</p>
        <p>In cluster 1, the studies mostly revolve around the digital transformation and the related phenomena of the industry 4.0 and servitization. Some authors have argued that the Digital transformation is allowing firms to improve their business models, restructure their operations, and create new business models (Warner and Wäger, 2019). In the manufacturing industries, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) brings about a modification of business models that rely less on lower skilled workers and boost efficiency (Arnold et al., 2016).</p>
        <p>Digital technologies allow firms to provide digital solutions to the customers whilst collecting customer data to empower capabilities affecting the manufacturing processes (Frank et al., 2019). Also, service industries are being radically transformed by digital technologies including AI as well as big data and IoT (Borghi and Mariani, 2021; Table 4 List of bibliometric analyses performed in this study.</p>

Additionally, digital technologies are supporting smart destinations whereby data are deployed in real time to enhance product development and improve value co-creation (Gretzel et al., 2015).</p>
        <p>studies pertaining to open innovation and smart cities. In recent years, organizations have adopted a more open approach to innovation by cooperating with external actors exchanging knowledge, technology, and resources beyond organisational boundaries in a collaborative manner (Randhawa et al., 2016). In the digital era, large amount of data is produced from open innovation (Scuotto et al., 2016) and this data can potentially feed AI for product innovation. Smart cities are public-private networks that provide services to citizens and their organizations with technological support, whilst taking into account the social and economic impact on society (Abella et al., 2017), generating vast amount of data through open innovation. Organizations collaborative efforts and cooperation in the network (Czakon et al., 2020) combined with web-based applications collective knowledge, contribute to transform smart cities into innovation ecosystems (Scuotto et al., 2016). By generating and compiling large quantities of data, smart cities can improve their internal processes and put into action collaborative options to create innovative products and services (Abella et al., 2017). 4.7.2.3. Technological innovation systems cluster. In cluster 3 we found studies focused on innovation systems and networks in technological innovation. An innovation system is defined as an ensemble of actors, organizations and institutions that collectively develop, diffuse, and utilize a new technology or innovation (Coenen and Díaz López, 2010). An important component of innovation systems are system resourcescollective structures such as standard processes, development programmes, common goals, or experimental facilities -that all members of the network can use collaboratively (Musiolik et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>Studies in cluster 4 are mainly related to technological forecasting and technological opportunities. Technology forecasting has been applied by firms to enhance management capabilities to examine rapidly available information to detect emergent technologies through visual representations (Zhu et al., 2002). In a different study (Boon and Park, 2005), data mining techniques have been deployed to mine R&amp;D document databases for patent analysis. The information extracted is used to create patent maps and patent networks for technology opportunities that can be used to support new product development. The graphical representation of the relationships between patents in the networks helps firms identify possible disruptive technologies at the early stages of the innovation process, thus supporting technology forecasting (Kostoff et al., 2001) and the creation of innovative products (Kostoff et al., 2004). (Lee et al., 2013). Other studies have found that the development of a firm's internal knowledge management capability for radical innovation based on open ecosystems leveraging internal and external data, strengthens firms innovation capability (Santoro et al., 2018). In disruptive technologies implementation such as IoT, firms' involvement with consumers plays a key role as it allows to better manage firm's knowledge of the consumer base in relation to their proneness to adapt new technologies (Lettl, 2007). Additionally, customer knowledge for innovative product development plays an important role for knowledge management as customer attitudes can help firms reduce project risk whilst promoting business competitiveness (Su et al., 2006). 4.7.2.6. Digital technology consumer acceptance cluster. Cluster 6 entails mostly studies on consumer acceptance of digital technologies. Lancelot Miltgen et al. (2013) investigate the challenges of end-user biometrics (i. e., fingerprints, face recognition, iris recognition, hand geometry, and voice recognition) to assess consumers' AI acceptance. They found that compatibility, perceived usefulness and facilitating conditions are the most important variables in biometrics systems acceptance. Consumer acceptance of digital technologies and AI in service innovation has been investigated by Bolton et al. (2018): they emphasize that there are customer experience barriers involving automated technology such as virtual assistants and service robots, when the aim is to deliver customer service excellence in services. 4.7.2.7. Green innovation and supply chain cluster. Cluster 7 embeds studies that mostly revolve around green innovation and the application of big data on the development of green initiatives in the supply chain. Studies on the logistic industry show the importance of relying on big data analytics and IoT for operational cost reduction, improve workers' safety and lower the environmental impacts (Hopkins and Hawking, 2018). Other studies focus on how big data and related AI can be implemented to improve green product and green process innovation on the supply chain for sustainable performance and competitive advantage (El-Kassar and Singh, 2019). Last, it has been found that big data can support firms to enhance their supply chain innovation capabilities to increase competitiveness (Tan et al., 2015), and promote eco-efficiency, eco-innovation, and sustainability (Kiani Mavi et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>Based on the co-citation clusters network, we can identify the publications that have contributed to shaping and developing research on AI in innovation studies. Table 6 identifies works at the intersection of AI in innovation. For this analysis, we applied a normalization association strength method (Van Eck and Waltman, 2010) to measure the link strength between the publications based on co-citation patterns. The association strength method captures how frequently two articles are cited together by others, and how frequently two articles co-occur in the reference list of another publication (Zupic and Čater, 2015). The assumption is that shared articles typically disclose thematic similarities that reveal knowledge foundations and their contribution to the field over time. As clear from the table, most of the works are related to specific subfields of AI involving machine learning and data mining.</p>
        <p>We applied a keyword co-occurrence analysis to proxy the relationships between topics and concepts in the field. Keyword cooccurrence analysis is based on the assumption that the words appearing together are linked to each other by a thematic relationship. Furthermore, we mapped the evolution of the keywords and concepts to understand how they evolved and developed over time. Fig. 6 illustrates the keyword co-occurrence networks in the literature pertaining to AI in innovation studies. To map out the keywords (and to subsequently explore the development of central keywords in the literature), we ran a co-word analysis for network visualization. As is clear from the figure, "innovation" displays the highest co-occurrence frequency values (this is the reason why it is the biggest node of the network), and it is well connected with other words such as "artificial intelligence", "big data", "Internet of Things", and "automation".</p>
        <p>To name the keyword co-occurrence networks in our analysis, we used the keywords with the highest occurrence in each keyword cooccurrence network: innovation, artificial intelligence, big data, and Internet of Things.</p>
        <p>In parallel, and in line with the thematic analysis approach adopted in earlier studies (Braun and Clarke, 2006;Jedynak et al., 2021) the researchers read carefully the data, identifying codes and later themes relevant for the focal phenomenon. The themes emerging from the qualitative thematic analysis converged with the themes identified by means of the keyword co-occurrence analysis. Accordingly, the overall approach followed for the thematic analysis was eventually a mixed method approach entailing both quantitative and qualitative approaches. 4.7.4.1. Innovation. The concept of technology-led innovation has received a lot of attention from academics. For example, technological developments in the manufacturing (Rosenthal, 1984) and construction (Tatum and Funke, 1988) industries, as well as related innovation, have been extensively investigated. New technologies were integrated into corporate operations in various sectors as a strategy to boost productivity, efficiency, competitiveness, and performance (Akter et al., 2020) respond quickly to changing markets (Mariani and Nambisan, 2021), and stay competitive (Hutchinson, 2021). 4.7.4.2. Artificial intelligence. AI has been defined as systems designed with the " objective of creating human-like behaviour in machines for perception, reasoning, and action" (Prem, 2019, p.2). AI has risen in power as a result of significant advances in computational capacity and a wide range of new technologies (e.g., computer vision, machine learning, and natural language processing) (Mariani et al., 2022), as well as the blast of data to train algorithms (Bornet et al., 2021). The growing number of publications over time attests to AI's growing relevance in innovation, particularly in terms of how AI supports innovation decisions (Kakatkar et al., 2020). AI enabling digital experimentation and digital innovation (Mariani and Nambisan, 2021), AI and sustainable business models (Di Vaio et al., 2020), AI in supply chain management (El-Kassar and Singh, 2019), strategic uses of AI (Yams et al., 2020). 4.7.4.3. Big data. In a wide range of industries and contexts, big data helps companies manage internal and external data to uncover new market possibilities and maintain their competitive advantage (Zhang et al., 2019). For example, using big data tools to retrieve, process, analyse, and report customer online opinions and behaviours allows companies to create more tailored products (Ciampi et al., 2021) and services (Mariani and Borghi, 2020;Mariani and Borghi, 2021) that provide them a competitive edge. Furthermore, big data predictive analytics allows businesses to improve product, service, and business model innovation (Blackburn et al., 2017;Mariani and Nambisan, 2021). 4.7.4.4. Internet of things (IoT). Kevin Ashton coined the term "Internet of Things" in the field of supply chain management in 1999. The adoption of IoT technology and devices using IoT technology (biometrics, sensors, radio frequency identification (RFID)) allows devices and services to interact autonomously (Jedynak et al., 2021). For example, IoT technology has been implemented in health care sector (Papa et al., 2020); in the agricultural sector (Gurbuz and Ozkan, 2020); or in the context of smart cities (Scuotto et al., 2016b).</p>
        <p>To explore the development of central keywords over time, we run a dynamic co-word analysis. Fig. 7 illustrates the evolution of concepts in the focal research area.</p>
        <p>The development of central keywords over time suggests that studies in nanotechnology patenting, neural networks, and decision support systems have become more frequent around 2011. Table 7 illustrates the frequency of the keywords in the literature. Starting from 2013, the publications on data mining and innovation adoption emerge. Around 2015, technological innovation and process innovation studies become more frequent and, in 2016, the keywords start highlighting text mining and product innovation. In 2017, concepts such as business model, product development, governance, crowdsourcing and innovation diffusion become increasingly frequent in the focal literature.</p>
        <p>Around 2018, studies including the words "big data", "IoT", "artificial intelligence", "disruptive innovation", "robotics" and "cloud computing" become more numerous. Studies published produced in 2019 start displaying more frequently words such as Industry 4.0, digital transformation, digitalization, business model innovation, digital innovation, blockchain and sustainably, whereas studies published in 2020 tend to focus on digital technologies and circular economy. The increasing relevance of concepts related to sustainabilitysuch as the circular economydisplays that environmental and social dimensions tend to become more relevant, given the increasing number of firms committed to sustainable innovation. Interestingly, it seems that increasing use of AI related keywords reflects technological</p>
        <p>Landmark publications on AI in Innovation literature. advancements of AI, as a consequence of the increasing large-scale government financing of AI initiatives across different sectors of the economy (Mariani et al., 2022).</p>
        <p>By leveraging density visualization techniques, we identified clusters of concepts connected with keywords appearing together in the literature. Density visualization provides a snapshot of the distribution of variables (in our case keywords), using a kernel density (Van Eck and Waltman, 2010). Kernel density is based on the probability density function of variables by co-term occurrences. From an operational viewpoint, for the density visualization, we created a map based on text data, after having extracted information from the title and the abstract fields of the articles and by subsequently applying a full counting method. By default, a minimum of 20 occurrence threshold of a term in the literature pool generated 5 major clusters by relevance. Fig. 8 illustrates a density visualization of the prominent terms' clusters. The cluster displaying the highest density is highlighted in green colour and entails studies related to the application of big data analytics, dynamic capabilities, business processes, sustainable development, organisational firm performance. A second cluster, red coloured, consists of studies on technology development and technological forecasting, text and data mining, patenting and innovation performance. The dark blue colour cluster entails studies on product innovation, digital technologies, digital platforms and digital innovation. The yellow-coloured cluster includes studies on business models, industrial internet, innovative technology, IoT technology and sensor technology. Finally, the cluster in purple embeds research on IoT adoption, bringing together concepts of e-commerce, cloud computing and innovation diffusion.</p>
        <p>We focused on the 30 most cited documents in our database as those articles offer valuable contributions to the research field representing reference points for scholars doing research in the field (Snyder, 2019). In line with other SLRs guidelines (e.g., Donthu et al., 2021) we identified in 120 the minimum number of citations for the articles to be part of this part of the analysis. After and in depth reading, we created a matrix reporting: the research topic; the nature of the study (conceptual or empirical); the research design (methodology); the time frame (cross-section or longitudinal); the theory adopted; the level of analysis (institutional, organizational, individual); in the case of empirical and quantitative studies: dependent variable, independent variables, moderating and mediating variables. The matrix can be useful to portray the different feature of the most cited studies. Table 8 portraits the most cited articles in our literature sample and is organized from the most cited to the least cited article.</p>
        <p>Subsequently we analysed the most recurring words in the titles and abstracts of the articles included in our database (N=1,448) by means of a word cloud visualization. A word cloud graphically represents the most frequent terms appearing in the titles and abstracts of the articles; a word that appears more frequently displays a greater font size. Figure 9 (see Fig. 9) illustrates such word cloud. At a short glance, it seems that the most recurring words are "innovation" (this is by construction, given the choice of terms for the search query) and "technology".</p>
        <p>To map out extant research into our study framework depicted in Fig. 10 we group the articles into two groups: drivers of AI adoption for innovation (Table 9) and outcomes of AI adoption (Table 10). We discuss the drivers and the outcomes of our framework in the ensuing subsections.</p>
        <p>We analyzed the literature to identify the drivers of AI adoption for innovation. Table 9 categorizes and illustrates studies revolving around the drivers of AI adoption for innovation. We categorized the studies into three different categories: economic drivers (cost, productivity, time, decision-making), technological drivers (big data, IoT, digital platforms), and social drivers (sustainability, waste management). 4.9.1.1. Economic drivers. When firms decide to adopt AI technology, they can do it for economic reasons such as cost reduction (Rose et al., 2020;Verganti et al., 2020), compression of time for new product development (Chou and Kimbrough, 2016;Hutchinson, 2021), enhancement of firm productivity (Hwang and Katayama, 2009;Kayser et al., 2018;Li et al., 2019;Makowski and Kajikawa, 2021) and support decision-making processes leading to better economic outcomes (Havins, 2020;Paredes-Frigolett and Gomes, 2016;Yilmaz Eroglu and Kilic, 2017).</p>
        <p>4.9.1.1.1. Costs. To reduce costs, firms adopt AI systems to help them to reduce manufacturing costs which typically translate into offering products and services at competitive prices (Verganti et al., 2020). Additionally, the adoption of AI empowered systems promotes a reduction of R&amp;D costs, enabling firms to compress the costs incurred to create and design new products (Rose et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>4.9.1.1.2. Productivity. AI implementation allows firms to improve their operations, particularly in the manufacturing industry. Typically this involves enhancing assembly lines processes, and ultimately increasing productivity (Hwang and Katayama, 2009). Additionally, the adoption of automated technology such as self-innovating AI (Makowski and Kajikawa, 2021) could independently identify new opportunities for new product development, while controlling productivity and improving manufacturing capacity (Li et al., 2019). As AI systems generate large amount of valuable data, big data analytics firms could make this data useful to make transformation process more efficient and effective (Kayser et al., 2018).</p>
        <p>4.9.1.1.3. Time. Time is of the essence and a key element in the analysis of technology-enabled innovation. Firms can spend time improving existing products (incremental innovation) versus developing new products (radical innovation). AI adoption allows firms to save time for both incremental and radical product innovation (Chou and Kimbrough, 2016), and to dedicate more time to research and development (Hutchinson, 2021).</p>
        <p>4.9.1.1.4. Decision-making. The adoption of AI models can support firms' decision-making to improve financial performance (Havins, 2020). For instance, some studies have illustrated the Hybrid Genetic Local Search Algorithm to identify factors that can better support decision making in firms aiming to enhance innovation performance (Yilmaz Eroglu and Kilic, 2017). The Multi-criteria decision analysis for automated data retrieval from structured and unstructured data sources and platforms (e.g., Internet) has been found relevant to support not only innovation, but also decision-making processes (Paredes-Frigolett and Gomes, 2016) to improve financial performance. 4.9.1.2. Technological drivers. Firms' adoption of innovative AI technology allows them to manage a huge amount of structured and unstructured data available from different sources. Big data (Blackburn et al., 2017;Caputo et al., 2020;Ciampi et al., 2021;Zhang et al., 2019), IoT (Butschan et al., 2019;Gurbuz and Ozkan, 2020;Papa et al., 2020) and digital platforms (Antons et al., 2020;Klein et al., 2020;Thorleuchter and Van Den Poel, 2016) are the most common technological drivers for firms adopting AI to innovate.</p>
        <p>4.9.1.2.1. Big data. The adoption of big data helps firms to manage internal and external data to identify new market opportunities and to maintain their competitive advantage in a wide range of industries and contexts (Zhang et al., 2019). For example, the use of big data tools to retrieve, process, analyse and report customer online opinions and behaviours allows to develop more customized products (Ciampi et al., 2021) and services (Mariani and Borghi, 2020;Mariani and Borghi, 2021) that allow firms to gain a competitive advantage. Additionally, the implementation of AI based analytical tools to manage large datasets allows firms to make better R&amp;D decisions. Moreover, predictive analytics stemming from big data allow firms to enhance product, service and business model innovation (Blackburn et al., 2017;Mariani and Nambisan, 2021). Big data plays a critical role in accelerating firms' sensing capabilities to respond to rapid market changes and thus improve firms' economic performance (Caputo et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>The industrial internet of things (IIoT) represents the expansion and application of the internet of things (IoT) throughout the manufacturing industry. The implementation of IIoT improves firms' productivity, and provides real time analytics to increase the efficiency of operations. In the context of IoT, the adoption of smart wearable healthcare (SWH) devices using IoT technology (biometrics, sensors) that collects, monitor and control individuals' health allow the firm to collect data that can support decision-making process (Papa et al., 2020) and develop more tailored healthcare services. In the agricultural sector, smart IoT applications are being implemented into the supply chain, with three objectives: allowing farmers to better plan the seeding and harvesting activities; deploying analytics to tailor services; reducing the ecological footprint (Gurbuz and Ozkan, 2020).</p>
        <p>4.9.1.2.3. Digital platforms. Digital platforms can be defined as a combination of digital technology applications which facilitate the exchange of information between user groups (Klein et al., 2020) and stakeholders. Digital platforms can provide a customised and dynamic environment that promotes client engagement and massive data flow (Bolton et al., 2018). Digital platforms can be used to enhance the customer journey and experience (Mariani et al., 2022) but also to help digital entrepreneurs (Nambisan, 2017) improve and customize their products. More specifically, the information extracted through digital platforms could be useful to identify new ideas to identify a new customer need or to solve a particular customer problem (Kakatkar et al., 2020) and for new product development (Thorleuchter and Van Den Poel, 2016).</p>
        <p>4.9.1.3. Social drivers. In light of national policies trying to reduce the effects of climate change, firms willing to innovate are deploying more greener and innovative solutions into their business operations. AI deployment as an innovative green solution promotes firms' sustainability, help them to improve their production processes, to reduce waste in product development, and to lower the production costs (Brdulak, 2020;Ozcan et al., 2021;Schuh et al., 2011;Tariq et al., 2017). 4.9.1.3.1. Sustainability. One way firms could improve their sustainability at the R&amp;D stage, is by retrieving data from social media platforms (i.e., Twitter, Facebook and Instagram) to identify new ideas for new product development (Ozcan et al., 2021) as digital platforms provide important information regarding consumers opinions about sustainable products. Additionally, the data retrieved automatically from their reviews supports businesses to detect and monitor environmental concerns and improve the ecological value of new and existing products and services (Mariani and Borghi, 2020). The implementation of AI systems supports firms to promote sustainable transformation in production and innovation processes (Tariq et al., 2017).</p>
        <p>4.9.1.3.2. Waste management. Research and Development of a new product is time consuming and expensive. Firms are implementing innovative strategies into their businesses to ensure project success. By identifying customers' expectations and needs at the beginning of the project through AI, firms reduce waste product development (Schuh et al., 2011) making better use of their resources and materials promoting sustainability at product development stage. Additionally, with the implementation of AI systems in combination with IoT, firms and cities can monitor their pollution, waste or even remotely control equipment or electric illumination systems (Brdulak, 2020).</p>
        <p>We analyzed the literature to identify outcomes of AI adoption for innovation. Table 10 categorizes and illustrates studies revolving around the outcomes of AI adoption Our findings suggest that there are three major categories of outcomes: economic outcomes (performance, effectiveness, efficiency); competitive and organizational outcomes (competitive advantage, organisational capabilities) and innovation outcomes (development of patents; development of new technology; product, process and business model innovation). 4.9.2.1. Economic outcomes. The economic outcomes of firms' AI adoption are linked to firm performance (Bai and Li, 2020;Beilin et al., 2019;Musiolik et al., 2020), effectiveness (Desouza et al., 2020;Yu and Huang, 2014) and firm efficiency (Calvetti et al., 2020;Haefner et al., 2021;Prem, 2019).</p>
        <p>4.9.2.1.1. Performance. AI systems are valuable for firms to adopt measurements models to evaluate their own and their partners' performance, and evaluate the risks related to partnerships, to enhance the value stemming from partners (Beilin et al., 2019). AI can aid organizations to develop standard processes, programmes, goals, or experimental facilities that all stakeholders can use (Musiolik et al., 2020) in a network sharing knowledge to achieve better performance. AI systems aid firms to develop collaborative strategies and actions for performance enhancement and market innovation (Bai and Li, 2020). Loebbecke and Picot (2015) 4.9.2.1.2. Effectiveness. The deployment of AI allows firms to manage effectively their data and their partnership network. Firms assess their data, technological capacity, organisation human capabilities and their surrounding environment (Desouza et al., 2020) to identify potential threats to firms' effectiveness. Additionally, AI systems support firms to reduce process costs, save time and resources to be more effective (Desouza et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>The implementation of digital technology in airports is an example how organizations could leverage their AI adoption. The implementation of automated customer boarder clearance systems facilitates customers to travel using a digital Passport and face recognition. The use of AI technology systems for immigration purposes sets an effective system for boarder security management (Yu and Huang, 2014). Additionally, sets an effective tool for workforce management, is more accurate preventing human error, making as well better use of the their local settings (Yu and Huang, 2014) for their operations to be more effective. With a more accurate use of AI systems tools, customer saves time transforming and improving their experience.</p>
        <p>4.9.2.1.3. Efficiency. AI contributes for firms' efficiency. In the construction industry, AI systems and techniques for workforce management allows to monitor workers performance: those deployments bring benefits to firms for their operation efficiency (Calvetti et al., 2020). Individual performance monitoring could bring together firms' efficiency and workers professional development (Calvetti et al., 2020) possibly decreasing workforce turnover. AI also provides support to managers who are collaborating: firms enhance their internal capabilities and generate efficiency gains when collaborative activity between managers is powered by AI (Haefner et al., 2021). Additionally, human capital is an important key element in firm value creation: training is an important factor for workers to improve their precision ultimately translating into firm efficiency (Prem, 2019). 4.9.2.2. Competitive and organizational outcomes. The implementation of AI systems allows firms to increase their competitive advantage (Milovidov, 2018;Muhlroth and Grottke, 2020) in unstable market environments, reshape firms' (dynamic) capabilities (Warner and Wäger, 2019), thus offering opportunities for a shift from incremental to radical innovation capabilities (Yams et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>4.9.2.2.1. Competitive advantage. The implementation of AI systems allows firms to improve their competitive advantage in unstable market environments. Managing data with AI techniques could minimize human subjectivity in the R&amp;D stage, improving the opportunity to identify and develop new ideas, and identify new emergent technology (Milovidov, 2018). More generally, the deployment of AI can reduce managers' biases and improve managerial decisions making (Milovidov, 2018) that can bring about increased innovation performance and competitive advantage. AI can also be used also to improve market segmentation and therefore improve market positioning ultimately translating into competitive advantage (Muhlroth and Grottke, 2020).</p>
        <p>4.9.2.2.2. Organizational capabilities. Dynamic capabilities allow firms to sense opportunities and threats, seize opportunities, and maintain competitiveness through reconfiguring the business assets and resources (Teece et al., 1997a(Teece et al., , 1997b)). Digital technologies such as AI transforming firms' dynamic capabilities as now they can readjust (increase or decrease) their operations processes in a quicker, easier, and cheaper manner (Warner and Wäger, 2019), maximizing their profits and revenue. Additionally, the implementation of AI allows firms to shift from incremental innovation to radical innovation strengthening organizational innovation capabilities (Yams et al., 2020) as firm strategic renewal.</p>
        <p>4.9.2.3. Innovation outcomes. The use and implementation of AI support firms' products, process and business model innovation (Chatterjee et al., 2021a;Loebbecke and Picot, 2015;Zhan et al., 2017). Additionally, AI can help firms identify new opportunities for product development, by generating more opportunities to create, secure and exploit intelectual proprety rights (Alencar et al., 2007;An and Ahn, 2016;Boon and Park, 2005;Candelin-Palmqvist et al., 2012;Gavilanes-Trapote et al., 2015).</p>
        <p>4.9.2.3.1. Development of patents. Firms intelectual property, especially patents, are an indicator of business's innovation activity and performance, and are tightly related to technological innovation development (Alencar et al., 2007). AI can support firms by extracting from documents a large amount of data on research and development, that can assist to detect trends for innovative product development.</p>
        <p>4.9.2.3.2. Development of new technology. The implementation of AI systems helps firms to detect emergent tecnhologies leading to innovation development. AI supports firms to perform for patent analysis for tecnhological forecasting contributing to enterpreneurial development (An and Ahn, 2016). By extracting information of patents through AI, firms can identify new opportunities for technological development aimed at product or process innovation (Gavilanes-Trapote et al., 2015). Tecnhological forecasting provides firms with valuable geospatial information about the develeopment of technologies in a certain region over time. Tecnhological forecasting used to develop new tecnhologies for product or process innovation (An and Ahn, 2016) allows businesses to create strategies suitable for different geographical settings (Gavilanes-Trapote et al., 2015).</p>
        <p>4.9.2.3.3. Product, process and business model innovation. The use and implementation of AI allows firms to identify and prioritize consumer demand and determine the market potential in the research stage (Mariani and Nambisan, 2021). More specifically, AI can support the generation of innovation analytics (Kakatkar et al., 2020) either based on customers' user generated content about products and services or through digital experimentation (Mariani and Nambisan, 2021;Thomke, 2020). Innovation analytics in their turn support product, process or business model innovation (Mariani and Nambisan, 2021) and suggest if the launch of a new product is warranted or not (Kakatkar et al., 2020;Mariani and Fosso Wamba, 2020) and allow to release products rapidly into the market (Zhan et al., 2017). Generally, AI and data analytics allow firms to reduce their innovation risk and improve the innovation performance (Chatterjee et al., 2021a).</p>
        <p>This study has made several research and theoretical contributions to advance the research area at the intersection of AI and innovation and more generally the technology innovation management literature. First, we quantitatively evaluated the rapidly evolving research at the intersection of AI and innovation by producing an up-to-date and in-depth overview of extant literature and the ongoing debate in the field. This addresses recent calls for more research on the role of AI in innovation contexts (e.g., Cockburn et al., 2019) and systematizes the emergent yet expanding body of research revolving around the role of AI in innovation (e.g., Haefner et al., 2021;Kakatkar et al., 2020;Mariani and Nambisan, 2021). Moreover, given the rapid development of digital technologies (AI in particular) and related innovation management practice, this SLR aims to assist innovation scholars and practitioners to keep track of novel research findings that are beyond their main area of specialization and that represent indeed a frontier in innovation research. Second, our findings suggest that there are seven established topical areas that are informing developments in the research field at the intersection of AI and innovation: digital transformation (e.g., Frank et al., 2019;Warner and Wäger, 2019); smart cities and open innovation management and radical innovation (e.g., Abella et al., 2017;Randhawa et al., 2016); technological innovation systems (e.g., Coenen and Díaz López, 2010;Musiolik et al., 2020); technological forecasting and technological opportunities (e.g., Boon and Park, 2005;Kostoff et al., 2004); knowledge management and radical innovation (e.g., Lettl, 2007;Santoro et al., 2018); digital technology consumer acceptance (e.g., Bolton et al., 2018;Miltgen et al., 2013); green innovation and supply chain (e.g., El-Kassar and Singh, 2019;Kiani Mavi et al., 2019). Interestingly, several studies cover more than one theme and/or different disciplinary areas (Dwivedi et al., 2021;Loebbecke and Picot, 2015;Mariani et al., 2022;Scuotto et al., 2016). On one hand, this reflects the fact that innovation literature covers a broad set of disciplinary domains including entrepreneurship, marketing, strategic management, finance, and organizational behaviour, and indeed our literature review is multi-disciplinary in nature. On the other hand, this seems to suggest that scholars are already doing research across topical areas which might imply that they are trying to gain a more comprehensive view of the phenomenon they are analysing. Third, this study makes a contribution to the innovation literature by leveraging the SLR findings to develop an interpretive framework which sheds light on the drivers of AI adoption for innovation (economic, technological and social) and outcomes of AI adoption for innovation (economic, competitive and organizational, and innovation) providing a theoretical contribution to innovation research studies beyond extant knowledge (e.g., Haefner et al., 2021). Accordingly, through our interpretative framework we synthesize the observed piecemeal and fragmented results, and offer a more holistic understanding of the focal field to innovation researchers and practitioners. Fourth, we have singled out the most deployed theoretical lenses adopted in the focal research stream and identified the most frequently used: Technological innovation systems (TIS) theory; Fuzzy theories (i.e., fuzzy set theory, fuzzy logic); Technology acceptance model (TAM); Dynamic Capabilities; Diffusion of Innovation theory. By identifying the most widely used theories and methods, we also contributed novel ideas and directions for innovation scholars to conduct and undertake novel research in the field of technology innovation management, rather than repeat and recycle extant research. Last, we have contributed to develop directions and guidelines for future scholarship (reported in the Research Agenda section below) by identifying novel research gaps and providing a rich research agenda for further enquiry. This will inform the future evolution of (technology) innovation management research in the next decade and contribute to advance the frontier of innovation research, enabling the next generation of innovation scholars to tackle novel scientific challenges.</p>
        <p>This study displays a few limitations. First, we decided to collect data from Elsevier Scopus and Clarivate WOS over 
            <rs type="software">Google Scholar</rs>. Future research may collect data from 
            <rs type="software">Google Scholar</rs>, thus gathering further research outputs. Second, we decided for a ready on the shelf tool for our SLR (the software 
            <rs type="software">VOSviewer</rs>); future research could use additional tools such as 
            <rs type="software">CiteSpace</rs> for bibliometric maps visualization. Third, further research might look also at the level of analysis adopted across all the articles of the sample by carrying out a more granular analysis of the articles. Last, as most of the studies reviewed have an empirical nature, further research might dissect more analytically the role played by moderating and mediating variables, beyond direct influences.
        </p>
        <p>Based on this SLR, we identify several knowledge gaps and research opportunities in the field of AI in innovation research. Table 11 summarizes a research agenda based on the identification of several key unanswered research questions in the area at the intersection of AI and innovation.</p>
        <p>First, our review emphasizes some important knowledge gaps in relation to the economic drivers (categories 1-3), technological drivers (categories 4-6) and social drivers (category 7) encouraging firms to adopt AI for innovation goals and activities. Second, our SLR identifies research gaps in relation to the economic outcomes (categories 8-10), organizational outcomes (categories 11-12) and innovation outcomes (categories 13-15) of AI adoption for innovation.</p>
        <p>There are clearly some challenges that scholars interested in addressing the aforementioned sets of questions should face. First, as most of the empirical studies are quantitative, qualitative methods should be embraced more widely to better capture processes of AI adoption and use over time, as well as their outcomes, in a longitudinal fashion. Therefore we encourage extensive use of longitudinal data to uncover the underlying mechanisms of the time-varying effects (e.g., De Massis and Kotlar, 2014) inherent in developing AI-enabled innovation. Experiments might also help understand the cognitive underpinning of innovation managers' behaviours and decision processes. Second, it seems that mixed methods such as sequential exploratory methods (Creswell and Clark, 2017) could be suitably employed by scholars to address more comprehensively the research questions put forward in the research agenda. Third, innovation literature has emphasized that firm size matters as it influences organizational resources and capabilities to engage in innovation (Chen and Hambrick, 1995). Certainly, future research might shed light on the (moderating) impact of firm size on organizational adoption of AI and ultimately on AI-enabled innovations. Fourth, some literature has pointed out that, regardless of firm size, firms pursuing innovation can either develop digital technologies in house or outsource them (e.g., Mariani and Fosso Wamba, 2020). Future research might investigate if and to what extent different ways of embracing AI (internally vs. contracting it to external vendors) influence the way organizations actually innovate. Fifth, as some research has found that innovation is more dependent on external knowledge than internal research and development activities (e.g., (Calabrò et al., 2019;Kang and Kang, 2009), it might be fruitful to examine if firms are more likely to achieve favorable innovation outcomes by embedding AI into their R&amp;D activities or rather set up partnership to promote AI-enabled innovations. Sixth, extant studies have neglected that AI adoption for innovation purposes might differ across different types of firms (private, public, non-profit, family-led). For instance, recent research has shown that family-managed firms face difficulties in transitioning toward digital transformation (Ceipek et al., 2020) and that family-influenced firms differ from other types of firms in terms of how they engage in digital business opportunities and business model innovation (Soluk et al., 2021). Future research, especially qualitative case-based research, might explore the processes of AI development in firms with high level of family involvement to shed light on family firm idiosyncrasies regarding AI enabled innovation. Seventh, integrating data science and data analytics literature with mainstream innovation research might offer new research avenues by advancing the innovation analytics research stream (Mariani and Fosso Wamba, 2020;Mariani and Nambisan, 2021), and by enabling the emergence of innovation management research in the area of generative AI (Mariani, 2020). Eight, the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting firms of all sizes and types, but research still lacks profound insights into the managerial implications of this phenomenon. While</p>

        <p>(continued on next page) some firms are coping with this crisis by introducing digital innovations (Borghi and Mariani, 2022), other firms are rejecting digital innovation projects due to resource constraints (Soluk et al., 2021). Future research might unveil how in times of crisis firms engage differently in AI-enabled innovation and develop new digital business opportunities. Last but not least, we call for a multi-disciplinary approach that might blend the fields of management, innovation, information systems, and computer science to generate more holistic responses to the research questions identified.</p>
        <p>Combining a wide set of bibliometric techniquesspanning cocitation analysis, bibliographic coupling, co-word analysisthis work has contributed to reveal, present and map out the emerging intellectual structure (Donthu et al., 2021) of the innovation literature pertaining to AI. In so doing, it has helped to portray and illustrate the ongoing scientific debate on AI in the innovation field. Moreover, the study has made multiple research and theoretical contributions at the intersection of AI in innovation research (see section 5). Finally, by developing a rich research agenda, we hope and believe that this study has identified novel research gaps and research questions conducive to further fruitful enquiry. This will inform the future evolution of (technology) innovation management research in the next decade and contribute to advance the frontier of innovation research, enabling the next generation of innovation scholars to tackle novel scientific challenges. More specifically, the proposed research agenda will help innovation scholars interested in digital technologies (Artificial Intelligence in particular) to identify and address key research questions that will move the ongoing scientific debate on digital technologies in the innovation field to the next level. The proposed research agenda might also become a useful springboard for collaborative multi-and inter-disciplinary research on the focal field.</p>
