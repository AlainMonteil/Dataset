        <p>Data sharing techniques have progressively drawn increasing attention as a means of significantly reducing repetitive work. However, in the process of data sharing, the challenges regarding formation of mutual-trust relationships and increasing the level of user participation are yet to be solved. The existing solution is to use a third party as a trust organization for data sharing, but there is no dynamic incentive mechanism for data sharing with a large number of users. Blockchain 2.0 with smart contract has the natural advantage of being able to enable trust and automated transactions between a large number of users. This paper proposes a data sharing incentive model based on evolutionary game theory using blockchain with smart contract. The smart contract mechanism can dynamically control the excitation parameters and continuously encourages users to participate in data sharing.Data sharing techniques have progressively drawn increasing attention as a means of significantly reducing repetitive work.

        <p>In the era of big data, digital resources have grown exponentially, and data has become an important strategic resource. At present, the big data industry faces a dilemma referred to as the problem of "data islands". An effective solution to this problem would be to establish a reasonable and effective data sharing model [1] . Today, information disclosure and open sharing of data have become general trends in scientific, and even national, innovation. Numerous studies have shown that data sharing and reuse are conducive to accelerating the dissemination of data resources, by improving the efficiency and quality of work, and enhancing the potential for innovation [2][3][4][5] .In the era of big data, digital resources have grown exponentially, and data has become an important strategic resource.

        <p>Although data sharing has varying applications, it provides significant convenience in daily life. However, in the process of data sharing, there are still three problems to be solved: unwillingness to share, fear of sharing, and inability to share [6] . The unwillingness of users to share data is affected by the formation of mutual-trust relationships and the economic utility of data sharing. However, little research has been conducted on data sharing in the big data era and with the support of blockchain technology.Although data sharing has varying applications, it provides significant convenience in daily life.

        <p>Blockchain technology is a distributed, decentralized, and tamper-proof shared ledger technology that allows peer-topeer transmission [7,8] . Contract terms are enforced, which extend the functionality of the blockchain. The execution of smart contracts is shown in Fig. 1 . When a smart contract is called, the nodes in the blockchain run it locally with the parameters. If the result can be mutually verified, it is accepted and added to the blockchain.Blockchain technology is a distributed, decentralized, and tamper-proof shared ledger technology that allows peer-topeer transmission [7,8] .

        <p>Evolutionary game theory -a mathematical method used to study and predict the evolution of social interactions -considers individuals to be rational and then analyzes individual policy choices and game equilibria [20,21] . In the evolutionary game, it is important to determine that the concept behind the game equilibrium is the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), which is equivalent to the Nash equilibrium but can also be applied to the evolution of individual policies. When a state can be maintained under slight disturbances caused by the dynamic system, it is called a steady state.Evolutionary game theory -a mathematical method used to study and predict the evolution of social interactions -considers individuals to be rational and then analyzes individual policy choices and game equilibria [20,21] .

        <p>In addition to the concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy, evolutionary game theory also considers replicator dynamics (RD). According to conclusions derived from the replication dynamic model, the trend of individual strategy selection in the population can be better predicted. The mathematical formula for competitive growth dynamics in RD is a differential equation that simulates the individual participating in the game, so it can better describe the effective rational trend of an individual's behavior in the population. Some scholars have used the idea of games to conduct research on data sharing. Ali and Maheswaran [22] studied online data sharing on social networks from a game theory perspective, showing that when blacklisting is introduced as a triggering strategy, sharing conditions become balanced. Kamhoua et al. [23] used game methods to help online social network (OSN) users determine the optimal strategy for data sharing. Yassine et al. [24] proposed a game theory mechanism that balances the benefits of data use and individuals' privacy in deregulated smart grids. Tosh et al.

        <p>The expectation of data sharing is to get more people involved in data sharing. The data sharers can only choose to participate or not in data sharing. The strategy of these two behaviors depends on the bounded rationality of the user with limited information acquisition ability, and continuous learning, through trial and error, to gradually adjust their strategy. Therefore, the game theory of user participation in data sharing can be modeled by evolutionary game theory to find a way to adjust the user's participation in sharing expectations according to the current situation.The expectation of data sharing is to get more people involved in data sharing.

        <p>The various situations in the income matrix are discussed separately below. Case 1: Both users choose not to participate. In such a case, users in the data sharing blockchain platform will not share data. When users are not involved in data sharing, their utility gain only depends on their own investment costs. We use the logarithmic rate of return to calculate the return, which can be expressed using the logarithmic gain function μln (1 + R ). According to the realistic rationality requirement, μln (1 + R ) &gt; 0, otherwise the user is not willing to make any investment.

        <p>Case 2: Both users choose to participate in the strategy. In this case, each user shares data and can also receive data shared by other users to help increase revenue, which reduces the difficulty of solving problems. When users participate in data sharing, benefits are reaped not only from their own investment, but also from the data shared by other users. We regard these two kinds of income as γ μln (1 + R ), which is the common benefit of investment and sharing. Also based on the realistic rationality requirements, the shared benefit must be greater than 1, otherwise the user would have no motivation to share. When sharing data, a user needs to provide the sharing cost τ &gt; 0. Obviously, the data-sharing blockchain platform can provide incentives for all users, but this may result in saturation of such incentives and may also cause the inflation of virtual currency within the data sharing platform. Therefore, we provide an incentive parameter C, referred to as the incentive and participation cost.

        <p>Case 3: One user chooses to participate, and another user chooses not to. This situation describes the risk of participating in data sharing. Users who choose to participate in the strategy join the data sharing blockchain platform and share their own data, but they cannot obtain data from other users, incurring additional costs without additional shared benefits. The nonparticipating user does not pay any price and does not receive any benefit. Therefore, when one user chooses to participate in the strategy and another user chooses not to, the benefit of the user who chooses to participate in the strategy is μln (1 + R ) -τ -C and the benefit of the user who chooses not to participate in the strategy is μln (1 + R ).Case 3: One user chooses to participate, and another user chooses not to.

        <p>There are only two strategies in the EGI model: participation and nonparticipation. Therefore, in a population consisting of all users, θ ( t ) can be set as the hybrid strategy of the population at stage t , where θ ( t ) = ( θ 1 ( t ), θ 2 ( t )). If θ 1 ( t ) indicates the proportion of users who choose to participate in the policy, then θ 2 ( t ) = 1 -θ 1 ( t ) is the proportion of users who do not participate in the policy. For simplicity, θ 1 ( t ) is denoted as θ in the following. The expected benefit of the user selecting the participation strategy at this stage is Eq.

        <p>1 and θ * 2 are ESSs for users to participate in data sharing evolutionary games and θ * 3 is not an ESS. Condition 1 shows that if the proportion of the population initially choosing to participate in the strategy is less than θ thres , then the ESS tends to be non-participation, because the gain from the system is sufficient to force the entire group to move to the sharing strategy. ESS is not unique to users participating in the data sharing evolutionary game. Both participation and nonparticipation strategies have the potential for evolutionary stability, depending on which of the above conditions is met. To clearly illustrate that users participate in the data sharing evolutionary game with two potential ESSs that depend on the above conditions, Fig. 2 summarizes the ESS trends based on Conditions 1-4. We can see that both the participation and nonparticipation strategies may be ESSs, depending on the initial proportion of users who choose to participate in the strategy. These ESSs can be used as triggers for appropriate data sharing incentives and costs.1 and θ * 2 are ESSs for users to participate in data sharing evolutionary games and θ * 3 is not an ESS.

        <p>The above discussion illustrates the changing trend of the evolutionary stable structure based on blockchain data sharing. The factors affecting the trend change are the incentive/participation cost and the proportion of the population that initially chooses to participate in the strategy. Therefore, modeling the incentive/participation costs based on the above four conditions is critical to establishing and maintaining an effective blockchain platform for data sharing. These conditions not only indicate that ESS is achievable, but also show how incentive/participation costs promote user participation in data sharing; they additionally indicate that incentive/participation costs are an important factor in improving users' revenue through sharing.The above discussion illustrates the changing trend of the evolutionary stable structure based on blockchain data sharing.

        <p>Therefore, to allow the blockchain platform for data sharing to coexist with users, the user can take advantage of data sharing, and enable the blockchain platform for data sharing to advantageously manage users participating in data sharing. This establishes a dynamic incentive mechanism based on the EGI model, which can encourage more users to participate in data sharing, as shown in Fig. 3 . At the beginning of the game k, the initial number of users participating in data sharing is very small. According to the analysis, using conditions 4, incentives can be given instead of charging participation costs to encourage and motivate more users to move toward the participation strategy. Once the proportion of users participating in data sharing exceeds a certain threshold θ thre s k , then using condition 1, the blockchain platform for data sharing can now be implemented without any external incentives. Moreover, at this time, the blockchain platform for data sharing can impose a specific cost on the user. The same process is repeated to iteratively apply a set of participation costs until a set of participation costs is successfully charged or until the maximum phase of the game phase is reached. Therefore, the dynamic incentive/participation cost mechanism can maximize user participation, enabling more users to participate in data sharing, and experience the benefits of data sharing.Therefore, to allow the blockchain platform for data sharing to coexist with users, the user can take advantage of data sharing, and enable the blockchain platform for data sharing to advantageously manage users participating in data sharing.

Using Condition 4, incentives can be given to motivate more users to move toward the participation strategy. Once the proportion of users participating in data sharing exceeds a threshold, using Condition 1, it is possible to ensure that the blockchain platform for data sharing is self-sustaining in terms of participation strategies, and no external incentives are required.

The same process is repeated to iteratively apply a set of participation costs until a set of participation costs is successfully charged or until the maximum phase of the game phase is reached. Thus, the dynamic incentive and participation cost mechanism can maximize user participation, enabling more users to participate in and experience the benefits of data sharing.

        <p>Because the EGI model considers all participating users to be essentially the same, the parameters of all participants are the same. The deployment of smart contracts requires the initialization of the basic parameter com and the ordered incentive and participation cost set The method EGI_GetTage() is used to obtain the current game stage, which is convenient for users to query and can be called at any time. The method EGI_Registe() is called when the user registers, and the user is incremented to update the variable.Because the EGI model considers all participating users to be essentially the same, the parameters of all participants are the same.

        <p>The method EGI_GetCost() is called when the user participates in data sharing, and is used to dynamically adjust the incentive and participation cost parameter and return the incentive and participation cost parameter that should be applied to the current user.

        <p>Assuming that the smart contract for data sharing is ShCon , when the user participates in data sharing, ShCon calls the whether the current participation cost is the largest, then returns the maximum participation cost. Otherwise, the algorithm determines whether the user participation ratio in the current game stage tends to be saturated (i.e. greater than 95%). If saturated, it enters the next stage of the game, resets the number of user participants and level of user participation, and selects a small participating cost that is not used in the participating cost set. Then, the threshold of the current stage is recalculated and compared with the user participation ratio. If the user participation ratio is less than the threshold, the incentive parameter is returned; otherwise, the current participation cost is returned. This system includes a blockchain network, and when users want to enter the blockchain network for data sharing, EGI functions-EGI_Regist on the blockchain will be invoked, as shown in Fig. 5 . When the user wants to share the data, the function EGI_Cost is called to request the excitation cost.And through function EGI_Cost, it returns the incentive cost to the user.Assuming that the smart contract for data sharing is ShCon , when the user participates in data sharing, ShCon calls the whether the current participation cost is the largest, then returns the maximum participation cost. Otherwise, the algorithm determines whether the user participation ratio in the current game stage tends to be saturated (i.e. greater than 95%). If saturated, it enters the next stage of the game, resets the number of user participants and level of user participation, and selects a small participating cost that is not used in the participating cost set. Then, the threshold of the current stage is recalculated and compared with the user participation ratio. If the user participation ratio is less than the threshold, the incentive parameter is returned; otherwise, the current participation cost is returned.

        <p>In this section, by setting different values of γ , μ, R , τ and C, "we verify the role of user participation in the ESS as well as verify the incentive mechanism in the data sharing evolutionary game. The experiment is divided into two groups: the values of the game parameters set in the first set of experiments satisfy Conditions 1 to 4, respectively, and then changes in the data sharing are observed for users participating in the evolution curve; the second group changes C under different initial user ratios, demonstrating the role of the incentive mechanism in the evolution of data sharing participation during the game.In this section, by setting different values of γ , μ, R , τ and C, "we verify the role of user participation in the ESS as well as verify the incentive mechanism in the data sharing evolutionary game.

        <p>For the first set of experiments, to satisfy Conditions 1 to 4, respectively, shared benefit γ = 3, scaling parameter μ = 5, investment amount R = 4, sharing cost τ and participation cost C all change. The settings for each condition are shown in Table 2 .For the first set of experiments, to satisfy Conditions 1 to 4, respectively, shared benefit γ = 3, scaling parameter μ = 5, investment amount R = 4, sharing cost τ and participation cost C all change. The settings for each condition are shown in Table 2 .</p>
        <p>For the second group of experiments, to explain the role of the incentive mechanism and how it promotes the data sharing user's choice of participation strategy, we set the following parameters to the following values: shared benefit γ = 3, scaling parameter μ = 5, investment amount R = 8, , and sharing cost τ = 2. In Condition 1, 0 &lt; C &lt; 9.89 and in Condition 4, C &lt; -2. Thus, for Conditions 1 and 4, we give the participation evolution curve against the ratio of different initial selections of data sharing participation strategies and the participation evolution curves under different excitation parameters 3 and4 below. The value of the game parameters in Fig. 6 satisfies Condition 1 and the user proportion threshold of the initial selection participation strategy θ thres = ( τ + C)/(( γ -1) μln (1 + R )) ≈ 0.31. As can be seen from Fig. 6 (a), when the initial participation ratio is 35%, the users participating in the interaction constantly adjust their strategies through learning and imitation. After multiple games, they finally choose to participate. The proportion of users of this strategy is stable at θ * 2 = 1 . As can be seen from Fig. 6 (b), when the initial participation ratio is 0.25, after multiple games, the proportion of users who finally choose to participate is stable at θ * 1 = 0 . Therefore, when the proportion of users who initially choose to participate in strategy θ * is below the threshold, most other users tend not to participate; however, when the proportion is above the threshold, users tend to participate. The values here of 25% and 35% are less than 50%, indicating that the number of people participating in data sharing is small. More than 50% means that the number of people sharing data is large, and close to saturation.For the second group of experiments, to explain the role of the incentive mechanism and how it promotes the data sharing user's choice of participation strategy, we set the following parameters to the following values: shared benefit γ = 3, scaling parameter μ = 5, investment amount R = 8, , and sharing cost τ = 2.

        <p>The values of the game parameters in Fig. 7 (a) and (b) satisfy Conditions 2 and 3, respectively. It can be seen from the results of these two experiments that regardless of whether the initial proportion of users participating in data sharing is 75% or 25%, after multiple game stages, users eventually tend not to participate. Therefore, for Conditions 2 and 3, regardless of the initial participation ratio, there is a tendency to not participate in the strategy. The values of the game parameters in Fig. 8 satisfy Condition 4. It can be seen from the experimental results that when the initial proportion of users participating in data sharing is 85%, after multiple game stages, users eventually tend to participate in the strategy. Even if the initial proportion of users participating in data sharing is 15%, users will eventually tend to participate in the strategy.

        <p>The value of the game parameters in Fig. 9 and participation costs affect the user's choice of ESS. At the same time, for the evolution curve of the selected participation strategy, the initial proportions of users are compared, and the higher the initial proportion of users, the faster the remaining users will choose to participate in the strategy. Therefore, within the controllable range of incentive and participation cost C (i.e. Condition 1 being satisfied), the participation cost can be gradually increased to encourage more users to participate in data sharing.The value of the game parameters in Fig. 9 and participation costs affect the user's choice of ESS.

        <p>The EGI incentive model dynamically adjusts the incentive/participation cost to facilitate user participation in data sharing. When the number of users participating in data sharing begins to decrease, if there is no incentive adjustment mechanism, users will likely continue to decrease, eventually leading to the failure of the data sharing network. The incentive adjustment mechanism increases the participation of users by increasing incentives, and maintains the scale and activity of users sharing networks, thus ensuring that a balance is achieved between the user participation level of the data sharing network and the network maintenance cost.The EGI incentive model dynamically adjusts the incentive/participation cost to facilitate user participation in data sharing.

        <p>In summary, this paper proposed a smart contract-based incentive method to maintain the level of user participation, by dynamically adjusting incentives and participation costs, which should encourage users to actively share data. A high level of user participation is very important to a data sharing system, and future research should also consider how user-shared data size and data quality can impact to the incentive adjustment required.In summary, this paper proposed a smart contract-based incentive method to maintain the level of user participation, by dynamically adjusting incentives and participation costs, which should encourage users to actively share data.
