        <p>Despite significant scientific achievements, some theoretical and applied problems, including significant differences in the perception of marketing tools by different age groups, remain unresolved. The lack of a comprehensive understanding of consumer attitudes towards different types of marketing communications predetermined the research relevance, aim, objectives, and content. One of the important tasks of this study is to establish cause-and-effect relationships and identify patterns in assessing the effectiveness of advertising through marketing communications. The research aims at studying the effectiveness of various communication channels and determining the most effective channel of communication with consumers. To achieve these goals, ANOVA is used, which helps to reveal the effectiveness of marketing communication tools and to study the impact of qualitative factors on the dependent quantitative variables. The research hypotheses are tested.Despite significant scientific achievements, some theoretical and applied problems, including significant differences in the perception of marketing tools by different age groups, remain unresolved.

        <p>Marketing communication channels play a significant role in influencing consumers as they serve as a tool for enabling two-way communication between a company and its audience, providing essential information about new products or services. Different communication channels are employed to achieve diverse marketing goals, including boosting sales, attracting new customers, retaining existing ones, and increasing brand awareness. Consumers are exposed to a wide range of communication forms, such as online advertising (including search, banner, AI chatbots, SMM, social media advertising, and bloggers), personal selling, direct marketing, public relations (PR), and promotions, among others [42].Marketing communication channels play a significant role in influencing consumers as they serve as a tool for enabling two-way communication between a company and its audience, providing essential information about new products or services.

        <p>A study marketing communication [43], suggests the important of conducting surveys among the target audience to determine the level of brand awareness and the brand's image. Promotions are aimed at stimulating the sales of specific products or services, and they encompass various types, such as discounts, coupons, gifts, and drawings. The digitalization of marketing communication has brought about changes in these practices. In the article [9], the author highlights that the effectiveness of promotions is measured using diverse metrics, including increased sales, website traffic, registrations or subscriptions, and average purchase value, among others. E. Cagnago and N. Ariani [45] investigated the significance and effectiveness of integrated marketing communications for small and medium-sized businesses. The main hypothesis of the study posits that the proper implementation of integrated marketing communications can enhance communication between sellers and buyers, increase sales, and minimize the need for repeated product promotion. The study utilized a qualitative descriptive approach and a case study method to analyse the marketing communication strategies already implemented in pure milk MSMEs. Asrul A. et al.

        <p>Virtual Economics, Vol. 6, No. 1,2023 in approaching consumers and reaching the desired target audience. R. Pehlevi [47] crafted bibliometric analyses of scientific articles on integrated marketing communications and identified four primary trends: the integration of marketing communications with customer relationship management, the concept of added value in communication plans, the utilization of questionnaires as a data collection method, and an equal number of studies on integrated marketing communications in both developed and developing countries. D. Mulder [42] examined the history of marketing communication and emphasized the importance of studying this history to understand a new approach called integrated communication. It is noteworthy that with the emergence of technology and scientific research, marketing communication has become increasingly complex and has evolved into integrated communication. The author explored the different phases of marketing communication development from the early 1960s to the present day and concluded that integrated communication is vital for the overall success of an organization. The issues of production management at different levels of management and management decision-making are also the subject of the scientific research. In this context, it is important to adhere to an integrated approach, which covers all areas of the enterprise's functioning, touching its strategies using marketing tools. Planning a set of marketing communications is one of the important stages of managing product promotion in the market. However, it is important to note that the implementation of strategies for the promotion of goods and services and the management of marketing communications cannot be considered separately since the result of the information exchange of the company under study depends on the interaction of the communication environment and management decisions. Therefore, it is important to ensure that these aspects of the company's activities are mutually consistent.Virtual Economics, Vol. 6, No. 1,2023 in approaching consumers and reaching the desired target audience.

        <p>Effective marketing promotion relies on the integration of communication and management subsystems, which work together to achieve goals and influence the response of the target audience. This ensures the efficiency of activities and impacts the overall performance of the enterprise. The success of product promotion is contingent on a well-thought-out, justified, and implemented promotion strategy that fosters the harmonious development of an enterprise. Streamlining these indicators enables companies to prioritize specific aspects of their marketing communications strategy, leading to more efficient resource allocation and cost-effective goal achievement. Moreover, it is appropriate to employ the latest technologies and interactive formats to engage younger audiences while using more traditional formats for older demographics. This approach enables enterprises to effectively capture the attention of different consumer groups and enhance the effectiveness of their marketing communication strategy [47].Effective marketing promotion relies on the integration of communication and management subsystems, which work together to achieve goals and influence the response of the target audience.

        <p>In the retail industry, careful planning of marketing communications is vital to establish effective consumer communication and ensure sustained demand for products. To achieve this, communication activities should be phased, and the communication policy should be flexible, allowing adjustments as necessary. Successful communication requires periodic review and adjustment of the communication policy, elimination of ineffective promotional methods, and the organization of planned and consistent communication activities. Additionally, reallocating the promotion budget can optimize efficiency in communication activities [48]. Furthermore, conducting marketing channel research and analysing data through ANOVA enables businesses to understand customer needs and preferences, which serves as the foundation for developing products and services that meet those needs. These tools also help determine optimal pricing strategies and distribution channels, resulting in increased sales and profits [49,50].In the retail industry, careful planning of marketing communications is vital to establish effective consumer communication and ensure sustained demand for products.

        <p>The study utilized data collected through a survey conducted among GH customers, leveraging the database of this women's wear chain. The research was conducted from January All respondents were divided into two customer groups within a store. The first group, which comprises 96% of the sample, consists of loyal customers referred to as "Special." These customers highly value the quality of service, actively engage with the store's promotions and events and are likely to become repeat customers. The second group, which makes up 4% of the sample, is labelled "Casual." These customers make a single purchase at the store and do not return. They exhibit limited interest in promotions and perceive prices as being too high. This group cannot be converted into regular customers and requires additional efforts to reengage them.The study utilized data collected through a survey conducted among GH customers, leveraging the database of this women's wear chain.

        <p>To test the selected hypotheses, ANOVA (analysis of variance) was employed as a robust statistical technique [51]. ANOVA allows for the examination of significant differences in consumer perception across a range of marketing communication tools (H1), as well as within specific age groups (H2). In conducting the ANOVA, the dependent variable was consumer perception, measured through survey responses. The independent variables were the different marketing communication tools and age groups. The analysis involved calculating the sum of squares for each variable, determining the degrees of freedom, and estimating the F-statistic and associated p value. A significance level of α = 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance [52,53].To test the selected hypotheses, ANOVA (analysis of variance) was employed as a robust statistical technique [51].

Additionally, to examine the equality of variances between two or more groups of data, Levene's test, which is based on the F test of sample variance, was applied. This test allowed for the assessment of whether there were statistically significant differences in the variances across the different groups. By examining the homogeneity of variances, Levene's test provided valuable information to ensure the validity of subsequent statistical analyses [54].where: W is the value of the Shapiro-Wilk coefficient; 𝑎 𝑡 is the table coefficients; 𝑦 𝑡 is a sample value; n is the number of observations.

        <p>The findings related to the impact of marketing tools are presented in Table 3. The first marketing tool examined is "Internet," which attracted a significant number of customers, with a total of 85 individuals participating in this channel. The total amount associated with this tool sums up to 85, with an average amount of 17. The dispersion value of 214 suggests a wide range of amounts reported by customers within each age group, indicating potential variations in their spending behaviour. Moving on to "Printed Advertisements," this marketing tool attracted a relatively lower number of customers, with only 9 individuals participating. Similar to the previous tool, these customers were also categorized into five different age groups. The total amount associated with printed advertisements is 9, resulting in an average amount of 1.8. The low dispersion value of 0.7 suggests a relatively consistent spending pattern among customers within each age group. The analysis also considered the impact of "billboards" on customer behaviour. This marketing tool attracted 25 customers, divided into five age groups. The total amount associated with billboards is 25, yielding an average amount of 5. However, the relatively high dispersion value of 19 The analysis of Table 3 reveals that the Internet has the greatest impact on young people, specifically consumers under the age of 34, compared to older audiences. This suggests that the Internet as a marketing tool is more effective in reaching and influencing younger demographics. On the other hand, the other marketing tools have shown relatively weaker effectiveness, indicating that newer technologies, such as the Internet, outperform traditional channels.The findings related to the impact of marketing tools are presented in Table 3.

On the other hand, the other marketing tools have shown relatively weaker effectiveness, indicating that newer technologies, such as the Internet, outperform traditional channels.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the analysis highlights that different age groups have varying levels of response to different communication channels. This implies that the age of customers plays a significant role in determining their susceptibility to specific marketing communication channels. Consequently, it is crucial for advertising campaigns to be targeted towards specific age groups that have demonstrated a higher level of response to the advertising information delivered through the respective marketing communication channel. This targeted approach ensures maximum effectiveness and resonance with the intended audience. Based on the outputs presented in Table 4, the analysis reveals statistically significant differences in the average amounts across different age groups. This confirms that age group membership has a significant influence on consumer spending patterns. Furthermore, the "between groups" variation source indicates that the variability in average amounts attributed to the different age groups is significant, as evidenced by the calculated F-statistic (3.558) and the associated p-value (0.0096). These results provide strong evidence to suggest that the average amounts differ significantly between the age groups.

        <p>The analysis reveals insights into consumer behaviour and preferences regarding marketing communication channels. It established that consumers aged 18 to 34 are the most active users of online advertising and direct marketing, while older consumers show a preference for promotions and point-of-sale advertising. This suggests that different age groups have distinct preferences in regard to engaging with marketing messages. Furthermore, the study indicates that younger consumers (under 34 years old) are more likely to accept online marketing communications, while older consumers are more likely to respond to billboards and promotions. This highlights the importance of tailoring marketing strategies to target specific age groups through the appropriate channels. Among the various channels, online advertising exhibits the highest diversity of consumer engagement, with a variance of 17. This suggests that online platforms provide a wider and more diverse audience that can be effectively reached through this channel, making it a valuable avenue for marketing efforts.The analysis reveals insights into consumer behaviour and preferences regarding marketing communication channels.

        <p>In the context of the GH store chain, the research identified the main channels that influence consumers to visit the store. On the one hand, this study indicates that billboard advertising is not an attractive means of communication with consumers as it was in the past. On the other hand, social media marketing campaigns have proven to be highly effective and popular, given the wide audience and diverse social groups that can be targeted using different criteria. In addition, social media platforms enable interaction with consumers, allowing companies to receive feedback and respond to their needs and preferences.In the context of the GH store chain, the research identified the main channels that influence consumers to visit the store.

        <p>The findings of this research have practical implications for marketing and advertising strategies. They can serve as a foundation for further research in the field, leading to the development of more effective communication and marketing strategies that can enhance business performance. The data obtained from the analysis can be used to conduct detailed studies on the effectiveness of various marketing communication channels and develop strategies to attract new customers. These insights can inform management decisions, improve product quality, and increase competitiveness in the market. Additionally, the analysis indicates that different age groups respond to marketing communications in a similar manner, suggesting that no single group can be singled out as being more receptive to advertising. This implies the need for a comprehensive approach when targeting different age groups in marketing campaigns. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of investigating the influence of various factors on consumers' purchasing decisions and establishing relationships between qualitative and quantitative variables. Overall, the research outcomes provide valuable insights into consumer behaviour and offer opportunities for further exploration and the development of effective marketing and advertising strategies.The findings of this research have practical implications for marketing and advertising strategies.
