        <p>Despite the popularity of open innovation in recent years, studies examining the impact of open innovation upon firm performance have shown mixed results. Previous empirical work on this topic is often based on surveys or archival sources, usually done either in isolation or in aggregate through employing proxy measures. In contrast, we employ an unsupervised learning technique (i.e., topic modelling) utilizing natural language processing to extract information on companies' open innovation practices, creating an initial keyword basket for future development. We then revisit the relationship between open innovation practices and financial performance of firms. The results show that a firm's overall openness level is associated with improved financial performance. More granular practices developed from our approach, however, show variations. The inverted U-shaped relationships are observed in specific open innovation practices but not in all, partly supporting the existence of the openness paradox from prior literature. The complementarity between internal R&amp;D and individual open innovation practices also varies by practice. Further, the influence of these open innovation practices also varies by sector. Our findings prompt us to conclude that open innovation's impact on financial performance is nuanced, and that there is no uniform set of best practices to practice open innovation effectively.Despite the popularity of open innovation in recent years, studies examining the impact of open innovation upon firm performance have shown mixed results.

        <p>With firm boundaries becoming more permeable, companies are increasingly embracing open innovation as part of their innovation strategies (Chesbrough, 2019;Shaikh and Levina, 2019). Defined as "a distributed innovation process based on purposively managed knowledge flows across organizational boundaries, using pecuniary and non-pecuniary mechanisms in line with the organization's business model", open innovation has attracted considerable academic attention in recent years (Bogers et al., 2017;Chesbrough and Bogers, 2014). Its impact has spread well beyond academic studies of industrial innovation processes. For instance, LinkedIn now lists more than 500,000 people with open innovation as part of their job, and more than 4600 job postings that involve open innovation. 1 Surveys of large firms practicing open innovation also showed that, while firms were still early in their understanding of how best to practice open innovation, their adoption of many of its practices was on the increase (Brunswicker andChesbrough, 2015, 2018).With firm boundaries becoming more permeable, companies are increasingly embracing open innovation as part of their innovation strategies (Chesbrough, 2019;Shaikh and Levina, 2019).

        <p>Many studies of open innovation look at broad dimensions of open innovation-i.e., outside-in open innovation, inside-out open innovation and coupled open innovation (e.g., Bianchi et al., 2016;Cassiman and Valentini, 2016;Greco et al., 2016;Lichtenthaler, 2009). Other empirical studies mainly focus on one or two open innovation practices (OIPs), like crowdsourcing (Liu et al., 2020), search breadth and search depth (Laursen and Salter, 2014), or external technology acquisition and exploitation (Hung and Chou, 2013). We define an OIP in this paper as the actual application or use of the ideas or methods based upon open innovation that companies implement for their innovation-related processes (Ebersberger et al., 2012;Spithoven, 2013;Spithoven et al., 2013), a definition we operationalize below in our methods section. There are only a limited number of studies that compare fine-grained OIPs (see examples from Ahn et al., 2015;Cheng and Huizingh, 2014;Mazzola et al., 2012). Moreover, these assessments of different OIPs are largely based on survey methods (e.g., Brunswicker and Chesbrough, 2018;Chen et al., 2016), and the relevant constructs derived from surveys are more about measuring innovation performance than firm financial performance. Survey methods also involve some limitations, including self-reported bias (Zobel et al., 2016), quality issues (Köhler et al., 2012),and the scale format and anchors used in survey research can systematically affect results (Podsakoff et al., 2003).Many studies of open innovation look at broad dimensions of open innovation-i.e., outside-in open innovation, inside-out open innovation and coupled open innovation (e.g., Bianchi et al., 2016;Cassiman and Valentini, 2016;Greco et al., 2016;Lichtenthaler, 2009).

        <p>Recently, developments in natural language processing (NLP), and in particular unsupervised topic modelling techniques, have the potential to address some of these limitations. They have been recognized in other areas of social science as powerful tools to analyze large unclassified textual data sources, which can create possible measures for our research interests (Alghamdi and Alfalqi, 2015;Teodoridis et al., 2020). Moreover, growing quantities of unstructured digitized text are available for research with the support of text mining approaches such as topic modelling techniques (Antons et al., 2020). In this paper, we use them to discover fine-grained OIPs, providing insights into the differences among various OIPs and their relationship with firm financial performance.Recently, developments in natural language processing (NLP), and in particular unsupervised topic modelling techniques, have the potential to address some of these limitations.

        <p>Our results show that NLP can capture nuanced variation in OIPs between firms. Our primary finding shows that a firm's overall openness is significantly and positively associated with improved firm financial performance. With our more granular treatment of individual OIPs, though, we find that this association varies significantly across practices and across sectors. The overall openness level does not show a curvilinear correlation with financial performance, yet certain OIPs do follow an inverted U-shape pattern with firm financial performance. The complementarity between internal R&amp;D and individual OIPs is sometimes positive, but other times negative. Moreover, practices that are positively and significantly associated with improved financial performance in one sector might show no significant effect in a different sector. And the salience of OIPs themselves varies largely by sector as well. These findings reveal a subtle, nuanced relationship between open innovation, individual practices, and firm performance. They suggest, among other things, that there are likely to be no single set of best practices in open innovation that would work in all sectors of the economy.Our results show that NLP can capture nuanced variation in OIPs between firms.

        <p>With increasing technological and environmental uncertainty and complexity, firms are relying on open innovation to ensure long-term competitiveness (Chesbrough, 2003). Firms, therefore, are evolving in their practices of open innovation, engaging in a variety of activities, from bilateral transactions to collaborations that involve multiple parties in an interactive relationship (Brunswicker and Chesbrough, 2018). Yet, the adoption of open innovation is not only a source of opportunities for companies as it can also present risks (Marullo et al., 2020).With increasing technological and environmental uncertainty and complexity, firms are relying on open innovation to ensure long-term competitiveness (Chesbrough, 2003).

        <p>On the one hand, by enabling knowledge flows across organizational boundaries, one of the main characteristics of open innovation is the involvement of external parties in the innovation process (Laursen and Salter, 2006;Chesbrough and Bogers, 2014). Companies can acquire needed knowledge from third parties (e.g., customers, competitors, collaborators), and use this augmented knowledge to improve innovative capabilities (Huizingh, 2011), to strengthen competitive advantage (Foss et al., 2010) , and to generate greater business performance (Oltra et al., 2018). On the other hand, however, a potential dark side of adopting open innovation exists as well (Frishammar et al., 2015). For instance, cognitive differences with external partners may occur throughout the process of implementing open innovation projects (Du et al., 2014); Organizational and cultural issues may emerge as a consequence of interacting with external partners (Marullo et al., 2020;Vahter et al., 2014); A focal firm may lose important knowledge to other actors in inter-organizational collaborations, which can lead to knowledge leakage and in turn lower firm performance (Easterby-Smith et al., 2008;Frishammar et al., 2015).On the one hand, by enabling knowledge flows across organizational boundaries, one of the main characteristics of open innovation is the involvement of external parties in the innovation process (Laursen and Salter, 2006;Chesbrough and Bogers, 2014).

        <p>These heterogenous views inevitably spur on a growing theme 'paradox of openness' in the open innovation literature (Arora et al., 2016;Bogers, 2011;Foege et al., 2019;Laursen and Salter, 2014;Wang et al., 2017). And correspondingly, extant empirical studies yield mixed results regarding the use of open innovation. For instance, Laursen and Salter (2006) reported both positive effectsbut also curvilinear effects from the searching modes of open innovation, meaning that after a certain point, the costs of additional openness were greater than its benefits. Lokshin et al. (2008) found evidence of complementarity between internal and external R&amp;D activities. Huizingh (2011) reviewed a variety of evidence on open innovation effectiveness, and reports mixed results. Laursen and Salter (2014) found a "paradox of openness", where the benefits of opening up must be balanced against the risks of unwanted expropriation. West and Kuk (2016) proposed an inherent complementarity of selective openness strategies between open and proprietary components. Cassiman and Valentini (2016), by contrast, found evidence that open innovation's inflows and outflows of knowledge were not complementary to one another, and that R&amp;D costs to generate knowledge outflows could rise faster than the benefits of those outflows. Grimpe and Sofka (2016), who contrasted collaborative vs. transactional open innovation activities regarding knowledge search, found that each had a stronger effect on performance in the presence of the other, making them complementary. Brunswicker and Vanhaverbeke (2015) argued that not all OIPs are beneficial in enhancing firm innovation performance.These heterogenous views inevitably spur on a growing theme 'paradox of openness' in the open innovation literature (Arora et al., 2016;Bogers, 2011;Foege et al., 2019;Laursen and Salter, 2014;Wang et al., 2017).

        <p>One critical reason for these mixed perceptions is that prior studies captured different facets of open innovation, while the phenomenon has been suggested to be broader and more comprehensive in scope (Foege et al., 2019). The aim of leveraging open innovation should include market-based, science-based and transaction-based relationships (Marullo et al., 2020;Vanhaverbeke et al., 2018). Moreover, to facilitate a closer connection between open innovation and firm-specific practices, it has been argued that the general advice implied in the open innovation literature lacks specificity, and more nuanced research on firm-level strategy for open innovation is needed to better understand the specific open innovation strategies (Felin and Zenger, 2020).One critical reason for these mixed perceptions is that prior studies captured different facets of open innovation, while the phenomenon has been suggested to be broader and more comprehensive in scope (Foege et al., 2019).

        <p>In general, innovation itself can be difficult to measure. Previous empirical studies that seek to demonstrate open innovation's impact on firm performance at an aggregate level suffer from some methodological limitations. It has been noted that the most common measures of OIPs are based on surveys (Asakawa et al., 2010;Lichtenthaler, 2009;Podmetina et al., 2014). Some of the best empirical work at the national level, for instance, derives from the Community Innovation Surveys that resulted from the Oslo Innovation Manual (OECD, 1997). This Manual was constructed in 1997, well before open innovation was introduced as a concept. So studies utilized variables contained in the Community Innovation Surveys (e.g., Greco et al., 2016;Grimpe and Sofka, 2016;Laursen and Salter, 2006) to construct proxy measures for openness, such as counts of the number of external sources of knowledge accessed during the innovation process. These variables were originally collected for other purposes, and some OIPs, such as crowdsourcing, were not recorded in specific survey instruments.In general, innovation itself can be difficult to measure.

        <p>There are other limitations to survey data. For instance, it is quite common to see that the scale format and anchors will systematically affect responses in survey research, and respondent characteristics and expectations are also well recognized as potential sources of method biases (Podsakoff et al., 2003). Moreover, the measures derived from surveys are based upon self-reported and largely qualitative data, which may raise quality issues regarding administration, non-response, and response accuracy (Criscuolo et al., 2010;Grimpe and Kaiser, 2010;Köhler et al., 2012). If a single respondent is both the source of the dependent variable and some of the independent variables, this can introduce personal beliefs into the empirical relationships being studied.There are other limitations to survey data.

        <p>Of course there are benefits to conducting surveys in innovation research, as surveys can provide direct and importance-weighted measures (Grimpe and Kaiser, 2010;Podsakoff et al., 2003). More importantly, they can collect information which cannot be accessed through public datasets, such as the turnover of new products to the firm (Laursen and Salter, 2006), or qualitative judgement data like innovation capabilities (Foss et al., 2011) or strategic capabilities (Ovuakporie et al., 2021).Of course there are benefits to conducting surveys in innovation research, as surveys can provide direct and importance-weighted measures (Grimpe and Kaiser, 2010;Podsakoff et al., 2003).

        <p>Another common approach to measure open innovation quantitatively is conducting supplementary quantitative interviews together with surveys in specific industries (e.g., Marullo et al., 2020;Pullen et al., 2012). Some empirical research has validated the contribution of open innovation to firm performance at the project level (Du et al., 2014), with observed differences between more scientifically-based collaborations and more market-oriented collaborations. There is a considerable body of archival research that measured specific activities related to open innovation by utilizing secondary datasets, mainly about alliance relationships (Schilling, 2009), such as investigating strategic technology agreements based on the MERIT-CATI dataset (Duysters and Hagedoorn, 2000). However, these archival datasets typically focus on one specific OIP, rather than covering all types of OIPs. Meanwhile, another research stream took patent data as a proxy to investigate specific technological knowledge flows within an open innovation context (e.g., Li and Tang, 2010;Wadhwa and Kotha, 2006). Such datasets are focused on specific industries or sectors, or specific practices, making it hard to generalize their findings to other industries or sectors. i In a broader scope, a common measure of innovation activity has been the issuance of patents, and citations to those patents (Nagaoka et al., 2010). As with our paper, new research on using patents to measure innovation extracts more insights from unclassified texts, using NLP techniques to construct measures of innovation (e.g., Arts et al., 2020;Vakili and Kaplan, 2020). However, the activities related to open innovation have not been developed to this point in time. Considering the desirability of more nuanced research on firm-level strategy for better open innovation activities (Felin and Zenger, 2020), we attempt to introduce this new methodology to try to improve our ability to identify and measure the interactions between OIPs. ii Following the use of topic modelling techniques in other parts of the social science literature (Antons et al., 2020;Corritore et al., 2020;Kang et al., 2020), we seek to utilize business communications that were constructed to report the financial results of that business, and then employ novel NLP methods to uncover OIPs used by those businesses. These communications can provide another lens to observe an organization's innovation practices. Like patents, these communications also are publicly observable to all, which greatly assists the ability of other scholars to replicate and extend the analyses we report below. And we have posted our keyword basket and source code in a publicly accessible GitHub repository, making it readily observable as well. These virtues, however, do come at a cost. We will discuss the limitations of our approach in the following Methods and Discussion sections of our paper.Another common approach to measure open innovation quantitatively is conducting supplementary quantitative interviews together with surveys in specific industries (e.g., Marullo et al., 2020;Pullen et al., 2012).

        <p>The prior literature has conducted numerous studies to investigate the relationship between open innovation and firm performance (i.e., mainly about innovation performance and financial performance). We reviewed relevant empirical analyses and summarized the main datasets they relied on, the scopes of open innovation, the constructs they built to measure firm performance, as well as the main findings in appendix Table A1 iii . A large portion of prior research featured a variety of constructs to measure innovation performance, most of which were derived from surveys (e.g., Grimpe and Sofka, 2016;Laursen and Salter, 2006). By contrast, we focus on investigating the impact of open innovation on firm financial performance (see Section 3.2.4 for more details), an approach that views innovation as a means to an end, in this case financial performance (Chesbrough, 2019).The prior literature has conducted numerous studies to investigate the relationship between open innovation and firm performance (i.e., mainly about innovation performance and financial performance).

        <p>Studying the relationship between open innovation and firm financial performance is not straightforward because open innovation is a relatively broad concept that comes in various different forms (Chesbrough, 2003;Dahlander and Gann, 2010;Huizingh, 2011). Scholars have studied practices as diverse as crowdsourcing, university partnerships, prize competitions, startup collaborations, corporate venture capital, co-creation with customers and/or with suppliers, intermediaries, and user innovation, all under the rubric of open innovation. As we discussed in Section 2.2, the majority of empirical studies were based on survey data to construct variables for different OIPs (e.g., Greco et al., 2016;Köhler et al., 2012;Sisodiya et al., 2013).Studying the relationship between open innovation and firm financial performance is not straightforward because open innovation is a relatively broad concept that comes in various different forms (Chesbrough, 2003;Dahlander and Gann, 2010;Huizingh, 2011).

        <p>Different effects (positive, negative, curvilinear and not significant) of open innovation activities on firm financial performance have been reported in various contexts (see Table A1). Specifically, while individual practices inspired by open innovation have shown positive results in numbers of studies, more negative results were reported when a more nuanced classification of OIPs was conducted (Ahn et al., 2015;Lichtenthaler, 2015;Mazzola et al., 2012). These disparate findings may be caused by a lack of more nuanced instruments to measure these effects in prior literature, apart from surveys (e.g., Chen et al., 2016;Greco et al., 2016). Owing to the complexity and heterogeneity of the concept of open innovation, which encompasses a variety of innovation activities, there have been substantial challenges to the measurement of open innovation (Ahn et al., 2015;Podmetina et al., 2014;Schroll and Mild, 2012). Thus, one fundamental research direction is to explore new methods to identify individual OIPs in a more fine-grained way, to see the interactions between these practices and examine how these practices influence firm financial performance.Different effects (positive, negative, curvilinear and not significant) of open innovation activities on firm financial performance have been reported in various contexts (see Table A1).

        <p>Internal R&amp;D has long been treated as the most prominent resource to firms' competitive advantage (Chen et al., 2016). It not only helps firms build their knowledge base (Veugelers and Cassiman, 1999), contributing to the development of firms' internal knowledge, but also strengthens their absorptive capacity and the resulting ability to use external knowledge (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990;Hung and Chou, 2013;Laursen and Salter, 2006), which is essential for open innovation effectiveness.Internal R&amp;D has long been treated as the most prominent resource to firms' competitive advantage (Chen et al., 2016).

        <p>In the open innovation process, utilizing internal R&amp;D enables an organization to develop its technological knowledge. Thus, a firm with high R&amp;D capacity has a sufficient degree of relevant knowledge to recognize the value of new ideas and external knowledge flows, and vice-versa (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990;Chesbrough, 2003;Spithoven et al., 2010). By effectively identifying relevant external technological and market-related knowledge, a firm can choose appropriate practices (i.e. license out, co-develop, or cross-license) to advance its innovation process or to gain more profits (Brunswicker and Chesbrough, 2018;Hung and Chou, 2013;Spithoven et al., 2010). Therefore, when a firm invests at a high level of internal R&amp;D activities, it acquires sufficient internal knowledge to appropriate benefits for better performance. These arguments strongly suggest that open innovation would be highly complementary to internal R&amp;D, and associated with better firm financial performance.In the open innovation process, utilizing internal R&amp;D enables an organization to develop its technological knowledge.

        <p>These findings, however, become less consistent, once researchers examine more specific OIPs. Prior research reports diverse findings on the relationship between internal R&amp;D and different types of OIPs (Chen et al., 2016). For instance, some studies revealed a complementary relationship between internal research and leveraging external knowledge (e.g., Cassiman and Veugelers, 2006;Rothaermel and Hess, 2007;Schmiedeberg, 2008). Yet some empirical research showed a substitutability relationship between them (e.g., Hess and Rothaermel, 2011;Laursen and Salter, 2006). And some report no significant results about their interactions (Lokshin et al., 2008). One possible reason for the divergent observations may be attributed to the diversity of different OIPs. Different OIPs or knowledge sources imply distinct characteristics (Chen et al., 2016), wherein the heterogeneity may cause disparate results (Hagedoorn and Wang, 2012). Given the importance of R&amp;D on the adoption of open innovation, as well as its role on firm performance, we also re-evaluate its moderating effect on the relationship between open innovation and firm financial performance, using more fine-grained measures about OIPs in this paper.These findings, however, become less consistent, once researchers examine more specific OIPs.

        <p>Our empirical analysis is based on unstructured data of how companies describe their business operations. The source of our corpus is the annual reports of U.S. publicly traded companies. We examine historical year-end 10-K filings of 2017, 2018, and 2019 (for the years 2016, 2017, and 2018 fiscal years' business operations, respectively), which are pooled for cross-sectional analysis. We obtained these data from the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) EDGAR database for Russell 3000 stocks. The Russell 3000 measures the performance of the 3000 largest publicly held companies incorporated in America by considering total market capitalization, and represents approximately 98% of the American public equity market by market value. Since the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation of 2009, CEOs and CFOs must personally sign these statements. In theory, they can be held personally liable for material errors and omissions in these reports. Therefore, there is a strong motivation for accuracy in these reports, and the top management of each company pays close attention to the content in these communications. They also represent one of the key sources of financial information for outside investors, and the SEC pays close attention to guard against misrepresentation or insider disclosure of material non-public information. These communications, thus, are carefully constructed, closely reviewed and broadly disseminated.Our empirical analysis is based on unstructured data of how companies describe their business operations.

        <p>In the 10-K fillings, we chose the Business section for text extraction. The Business Section describes a company's business, including its main products and services, and what markets it operates in. It also includes information about recent events, competition the company faces, and its strategy for competing in its environment, which is a good place to understand how the company operates its business (Li et al., 2013). More studies are starting to develop new measures to evaluate firms' strategy and performance based on 10-K filings (e.g., Li et al., 2013;Qiu and Wang, 2018). The code of Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS), an industry taxonomy developed in 1999 by the global financial community, is employed for our sectoral analysis in this paper. The data extraction is based on the 'edgar' package, which helps in bulk data gathering and textual analysis of EDGAR filings in the R language environment. 2 We extracted the financial data on all of the Russell 3000 firms from the WRDS CRSP Database. And we further restricted the firm sample to: 1) publicly-traded companies for which we have access to financial performance data from WRDS CRSP Database; and 2) firms with at least five extracted sentences based on our key-word basket to ensure that there is sufficient content to explore the distribution of OIPs. Because of this restriction, companies which are not active in adopting OIPs were not included in our dataset. These resulted in 6624 observations pooled over a three-year period. We also included measures of internal R&amp;D effort, i.e., R&amp;D intensity (RDI, dividing company R&amp;D expenditures by its sales) among these companies when those data were available.In the 10-K fillings, we chose the Business section for text extraction.

        <p>Although the premise of NLP is to develop automated approaches to process free-text data, building those approaches requires a substantial amount of manual analysis and annotation of data (Xia and Yetisgen-Yildiz, 2012). Annotation is an important prerequisite for NLP, as annotated data serves as a resource for creating statistical models by the application of machine learning approaches (Roberts et al., 2009). Based on human annotations of natural language data, machine learning algorithms can replicate directly a human classification task, thereby reducing noise in labels and features for a real-world dataset (Passonneau et al., 2009). Therefore, to improve the quality and accuracy of algorithms, producing high-quality annotations is essential to measure OIPs in our study.Although the premise of NLP is to develop automated approaches to process free-text data, building those approaches requires a substantial amount of manual analysis and annotation of data (Xia and Yetisgen-Yildiz, 2012).

        <p>Since there has not been an annotated dataset available regarding OIPs, we created a primary keyword basket (shown as the first step in Fig. 1, and the detailed steps we employed are shown in Fig. 2). This both informed our own analysis, and also can lay a foundation for future studies by other academics to build upon our keyword basket. To construct this basket, we started with the US publicly traded companies that were selected as the world's most innovative companies from Forbes (2018) 3 as the samples to primarily test different OIPs that are implemented in practice. 52 companies were selected in this step. Then, two scholars with two research assistants annotated the sentences and the keywords in the sentences which were judged to represent OIPs. We obtained 119 phrases that we used to represent OIPs.Since there has not been an annotated dataset available regarding OIPs, we created a primary keyword basket (shown as the first step in Fig. 1, and the detailed steps we employed are shown in Fig. 2).

        <p>To finally check whether the keywords we selected can in fact represent OIPs, we stemmed the keywords and used specific algorithms to extract all sentences in the business section of our 52 sample companies that include these stemmed keywords. A total of 1764 sentences were obtained. We randomly selected 500 sentences and divided them into 10 groups. Following common NLP research practice from other fields, we recruited a panel of 20 open innovation experts to help validate the labeling for 50 sentences each (Ghanem et al., 2019;Khodak et al., 2017). These experts were selected based on following criteria: 1) their core research has been related to open innovation, 2) their papers have been cited by others in the development of the field. As much as possible we tried to balance the seniority and gender of the researchers. The experts were invited to annotate the words (0, not related to OIPs; 1, related to OIPs) by relying on the context of the sentences that we extracted from the business section of annual reports. Table 1 exhibits some examples how invited experts helped validate the phrases which we put into the word basket. For instance, one sentence extracted from the business section of a random firm (#1 in Table 1), "to date, these alliances have taken several forms, including cooperation in the areas of product development, training, procedure development, and marketing activities", which includes a stemmed keyword (allianc) that we put in the keyword basket. Two experts and the authors of this paper then labeled this sentence at the same time. Only when the 2 experts both chose the 1 option (related to open innovation), did we consider the keywords contained in the sentence to represent OIPs. Similar annotation approaches were conduct by other studies to form labeled datasets in other research fields (Kang et al., 2020;Karoui et al., 2017;Skalicky and Crossley, 2018).To finally check whether the keywords we selected can in fact represent OIPs, we stemmed the keywords and used specific algorithms to extract all sentences in the business section of our 52 sample companies that include these stemmed keywords.

        <p>Topic modelling is an unsupervised machine learning technique for text-mining unstructured data, which can discover latent topics in documents (Blei, 2012). It is capable of scanning a set of documents, detecting word and phrase patterns within them, and automatically clustering word groups and similar expressions that best characterize a set of documents. This method assumes that a document is composed of words, and the topics covered in more than one document can be expressed by a combination of closely related words. Any given document can be associated with more than one topic. Therefore, topic modelling is a technique that can be used to infer latent topics in a collection of text documents (Westerlund et al., 2018).Topic modelling is an unsupervised machine learning technique for text-mining unstructured data, which can discover latent topics in documents (Blei, 2012).

        <p>There are multiple techniques and algorithms that can be used to data-mine text documents. Among them, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method has gained popularity, due to its great advantage of dealing with large-scale documents and interpreting identified latent topics (Blei, 2012;Blei et al., 2003). It allows sets of observations to be explained by unobserved word groups that explain why some parts of the data are similar, and it does this without imposing any prior structure on the data. For example, if observations are words collected into documents, it posits that each document is a mixture of a small number of topics and that each word's presence is attributable to one or more of the document's topics. A handful of studies have started to take advantage of such techniques in innovation studies (e.g., Choudhury et al., 2019;Kaplan and Vakili, 2015;Westerlund et al., 2018).There are multiple techniques and algorithms that can be used to data-mine text documents.

        <p>To put it more technically, the LDA approach inputs a documentterm matrix, for which the rows are unigram (single keywords) or bigram (two consecutive words) counts and the columns are annual report documents. LDA identifies distinct topics across the corpus by observing words that tend to co-occur frequently within each text. LDA then outputs a document-topic matrix, for which each document is assigned to a probabilistic mixture of topics, or a probability distribution giving the percentages across all topics. The number of topics to be used in the analysis is itself a choice that researchers must specify. Selecting too narrow a number of topics can lead to a lack of coverage of all the relevant information in the corpus, while choosing too large a number of topics can increase redundancy and complicate interpretation of the results. Because this is a subjective choice, we used a range of topics in our analysis. More details and original algorithms can be found in Blei et al. (2003) and Blei (2012).

        <p>In our study, we first extracted the annual reports (2016, 2017 and 2018 fiscal years) of publicly traded companies included in the Russell 3000 Index of publicly traded stocks in the United States, and then extracted their business sections. Then we removed common stop words and punctuations, discarded word order, and stemmed words by using the Porter stemming algorithm (Cao et al., 2009). After these steps, we constructed a document-term matrix for which the rows represent distinct sentences observed across business sections that contain the word from keyword basket we created. To ensure each document contains enough text for LDA analysis, we removed the samples (companies' annual reports) that do not include more than five sentences (5% of total documents). We ended up with 7925 documents, with 381,261 sentences in total.In our study, we first extracted the annual reports (2016, 2017 and 2018 fiscal years) of publicly traded companies included in the Russell 3000 Index of publicly traded stocks in the United States, and then extracted their business sections.

        <p>Our model training approach requires a key assumption: when companies describe their open innovation activities in their reports, they sometimes explicitly use some of the words in our keyword basket or a synonym and sometimes they do not. Since our research field lacks a mature labeled dataset about open innovation activities that could be used to analyze a corpus of data, we instead use the presence of our keyword basket as the labels that indicate a given phrase contains content relevant to open innovation iv . Training the LDA model with the extracted texts allows us to identify a set of topics related to OIPs.Our model training approach requires a key assumption: when companies describe their open innovation activities in their reports, they sometimes explicitly use some of the words in our keyword basket or a synonym and sometimes they do not.

        <p>We need to select the parameter for the number of topics for LDA analysis. As we aim at investigating the distribution of different OIPs, rather than maximizing the coherence or distinctiveness of the topics, we do not expect the topic numbers to influence significantly our results. We output the topics with different numbers (i.e., 25, 50, and 100 topics), and the results are highly consistent with those we report below. By inspection, 100 topics appeared to include a number of redundant topics, while 25 topics did not appear to cover all of the information in the corpus of data. Thus, we took the number of 50 topics each year as the main output for analysis we report.We need to select the parameter for the number of topics for LDA analysis.

        <p>Our main point is to derive different OIPs regarding the coordination and knowledge sharing in inter-organizational relationships (Brunswicker and Chesbrough, 2018), rather than investigating the types of partners with which firms conduct open innovation activities together (e.g., Du et al., 2014). Thus, to keep consistent with prior literature, we mainly refer to the open innovation classifications in limited existing studies to define clustered topics from LDA analysis. Mazzola et al. (2012), for instance, summarized twelve common OIPs that firm usually adopted, covering the activities from collaboration, licensing, to knowledge commercialization. Ahn et al. (2015) proposed an open innovation taxonomy with seven types of open innovation activities and three open innovation modes based on the dominant changes involved, from user involvement to spin-off. Brunswicker and Chesbrough (2018) distinguished OIPs into four major modes using two dimensions for classification, bilateral versus multi-actor and transactional versus collaborative, with seven individual OIPs.Our main point is to derive different OIPs regarding the coordination and knowledge sharing in inter-organizational relationships (Brunswicker and Chesbrough, 2018), rather than investigating the types of partners with which firms conduct open innovation activities together (e.g., Du et al., 2014). Thus, to keep consistent with prior literature, we mainly refer to the open innovation classifications in limited existing studies to define clustered topics from LDA analysis. Mazzola et al. (2012), for instance, summarized twelve common OIPs that firm usually adopted, covering the activities from collaboration, licensing, to knowledge commercialization. Ahn et al. (2015) proposed an open innovation taxonomy with seven types of open innovation activities and three open innovation modes based on the dominant changes involved, from user involvement to spin-off.

        <p>Based on the defined practices from these studies, we primarily propose eight individual OIPs by taking verified open innovation keyword baskets into account as well: network &amp; community; customer engagement; crowdsourcing; open innovation intermediaries; partnership &amp; joint venture activities; industry-academia collaboration; contract &amp; IP licensing; bilateral transactional activities. The final OIP classification in this study will be defined by the topics generated from LDA analysis.Based on the defined practices from these studies, we primarily propose eight individual OIPs by taking verified open innovation keyword baskets into account as well: network &amp; community; customer engagement; crowdsourcing; open innovation intermediaries; partnership &amp; joint venture activities; industry-academia collaboration; contract &amp; IP licensing; bilateral transactional activities.

        <p>We chose financial performance as our dependent variable rather than innovation performance with following reasons. First of all, while prior studies featured a variety of constructs used to measure innovation performance, (e.g., Brunswicker and Vanhaverbeke (2015); Chen et al. (2016); Grimpe and Sofka (2016); see more studies in Table A1), they remain relatively silent on how individual OIPs will influence the financial performance of the firm. We regard innovation performance as an intermediate measure in the pursuit of overall improved firm performance (i.e., not "innovation for its own sake") (Chesbrough, 2019)., Innovative activities in firms usually are intended to stimulate growth (Artz et al., 2010), and investors tend to reward companies that demonstrate creative business strategies and growth with higher valuations (Kogan et al., 2017). Firms can achieve a more reasonable and efficient allocation of resources by adopting different types of OIPs, which is beneficial for long-term financial performance. Recent publications have argued that open innovation needs to be managed to achieve positive business results (Chesbrough, 2019).We chose financial performance as our dependent variable rather than innovation performance with following reasons.

        <p>We measure firm financial performance by using Tobin's Q-i.e., the ratio of the market value of the firm to the book value of its assets as our dependent variable. Tobin's Q has been used to explain a wide variety of phenomena since it was first introduced, especially as a useful measure of firm financial performance (Bharadwaj et al., 1999;Lang and Stulz, 1994). Applying it to performance has been proved robust in various settings including diversification strategy and innovation (Hung and Chou, 2013). Regarded as a forward-looking measure, Tobin's Q is a good proxy for a firm's competitive advantage and its potential long-term profitability (Chung and Pruitt, 1994), which has been suggested as an appropriate indicator for open innovation related research, as the gains of open innovation will unfold over time in ways that may not always be directly observable (Hung and Chou, 2013;Lin et al., 2006;Sisodiya et al., 2013). Therefore, compared to other commonly used financial performance indicators, such as return on assets (ROA), or return on investment (ROI), Tobin's Q has a smaller average error and higher average correlations (Anderson et al., 2004), and its characteristics can represent open innovation better. When being used as a dependent variable, the potential measurement error of Tobin's Q is less of a concern (Lu and Beamish, 2004). Furthermore, other recent research has linked Tobin's Q to a firm's creativity and innovation, as judged by the market (Corritore et al., 2020). Following other studies to Fig. 3. Matrix notation for LDA with Dirichlet-distributed topic-word distributions.We measure firm financial performance by using Tobin's Q-i.e., the ratio of the market value of the firm to the book value of its assets as our dependent variable.

        <p>There are many factors that influence a firm's financial performance, so it is critical to identify other control variables that influence this relationship, in order to reduce the risk of omitted variable bias in estimating this relationship. Several variables have been identified in the empirical literature as influencing a firm's financial performance as control variables. First, we control for firm size, measured as the number of employees (expressed in log form), as firm sizes are commonly associated with growth prospects (Josefy et al., 2015). Further, we control firm prior performance for firm long-term financial performance, measured by the firm's return on assets (ROA) with a one-year lagged variable (Li and Tang, 2010). Another measure of a firm's investment intangible assets is capital intensity, measured by a firm's capital expenditures (net plant, property and equipment) divided by total assets, as higher expenditures are a natural trigger of firm performance (Li and Tang, 2010). We also control the year fixed effects, as well as including a set of 11 dummy variables for sectors (Chen et al., 2016).There are many factors that influence a firm's financial performance, so it is critical to identify other control variables that influence this relationship, in order to reduce the risk of omitted variable bias in estimating this relationship.

        <p>To measure the importance of internal R&amp;D for OIP adoption, we use firm-level R&amp;D intensity (RDI, R&amp;D expenditure divided by sales) (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990). We replace missing values of R&amp;D expenditure with 0 and cap the upper limit at 1, and then include a dummy variable for missing R&amp;D in the analysis based on prior studies (Blagoeva et al., 2020;Deb et al., 2017).

        <p>A key common issue with topic models is the reliability of topics, as it is based on unsupervised learning approaches to cluster topics. So we employed some pretreatment steps (following earlier LDA analyses in other social science fields) to improve the reliability of our topics. First, we manually read the annual reports to select relevant keywords by choosing the most innovative companies, which can help us observe more OIPs in real practices. Second, we relied on the language that companies are using to describe their real practices, rather than academic papers, to construct the keyword basket. Furthermore, we adopted an expert annotation approach to double check the initial keyword basket, removing the words whose inter-rater reliability is lower than 80%. By setting up these pretreatment steps before LDA analysis, we can reduce the noise from the original corpus and improve the reliability of clustered topics related to OIPs. We have to acknowledge, however, that our resulting keyword basket is likely to be incomplete and may not be comprehensive in its identification of OIPs. We do see it as an important initial step to build up a foundation for future research, which might enhance and extend the keyword basket we report here.A key common issue with topic models is the reliability of topics, as it is based on unsupervised learning approaches to cluster topics.

        <p>Even though we proposed eight individual OIPs based on the defined practices from prior studies (see 3.2.3 section), the final OIPs were derived from our LDA results. Although the presence of keywords represents the probability of OIP adoption by firms in our setting, we still followed the overall meaning of each topic closely. Therefore, only the topics including not less than two key-words were treated as the topics related to open innovation (each topic contains 10 words in our model setting), and other topics are regarded as unrelated topics to open innovation (i.e., the probability of adopting OIP = 0). We sum the probability of topics if they are relevant to any type of these OIPs. All topics generated from LDA analysis are shown on our keyword repository on GitHub. From the analysis, we characterized six main OIPs based on the word distributions among topics. These OIPs are: 1) Network &amp; community; 2) Customer engagement; 3) Partnership &amp; joint venture activities; 4) Industry-academia collaboration; 5) Contracts &amp; IP licensing; and 6) Bilateral transactional activities. Two OIPs were not found from our LDA analysis. These were the practices of crowdsourcing and of open innovation intermediaries. While managers did respond to survey prompts for these two practices in Brunswicker and Chesbrough (2015), our LDA topic modelling did not discern evidence for either practice from our corpus of Russell 3000 companies. We return to this finding in the Discussion section below.Even though we proposed eight individual OIPs based on the defined practices from prior studies (see 3.2.3 section), the final OIPs were derived from our LDA results.

        <p>Table 2 shows the selected topics and their associated words, where bold words are from the open innovation keyword baskets. We find that certain keywords appear together under several topics, and the simple labels we chose generally capture the underlying meanings of the topics regarding different OIPs. For instance, the words in Topic 5 are related to patent licensing, which we manually label this topic as contracts &amp; IP licensing activities. We visually represent an example in Fig. 4, to show how words are associated with different topics, represented by different shades of colors, and also show their topic probability distribution (with 4 topics in our chosen example). Specially for the OIP of bilateral transactional activities, even though some clustered topics are related to it, this type of OIP lacks a sufficient number of keywords to support its distribution among companies based on the keyword basket (see the limitations on Section 5.3). We remove it in the following analysis.Table 2 shows the selected topics and their associated words, where bold words are from the open innovation keyword baskets.

        <p>Table 3 presents the descriptive statistics and simple correlations among our variables. We took the probability of all OIP adoptions (the sum of the probabilities of OIPs, OIP_sum) as the proxy measure for each firm's openness level. The correlation table indicates there are no strong correlations between the independent variables, and we also examined variance inflation factor (VIF) values for the variables, and all the VIF values are below the thresholds suggested by references (Hair et al., 2011), both of which indicate that multi-collinearity is not a problem for this study.Table 3 presents the descriptive statistics and simple correlations among our variables.

        <p>Consistent with the findings proposed by prior studies, the openness level (OIP_sum) has a significant positive association with Tobin's Q, but not all individual OIPs are significantly positively associated with Tobin's Q. And the overall openness level is significantly positively associated with internal R&amp;D intensity. Meanwhile, it is interesting to note even in the descriptive statistics we find a result that we did not expect: the five individual OIPs do not all correlate positively to one another, but on the contrary, some of them are negatively correlated to each other. The correlation table shows a relatively strong positive, statistically significant correlation between OIP1 (Network &amp; communities) and OIP2 (Customer engagement), and also between OIP4 (Industry-academia collaboration) and OIP5 (Contracts &amp; IP licensing). Other OIPs overall show negative correlations to each other, especially OIP3 (Partnership &amp; joint venture activities) to the other OIPs.Consistent with the findings proposed by prior studies, the openness level (OIP_sum) has a significant positive association with Tobin's Q, but not all individual OIPs are significantly positively associated with Tobin's Q.

        <p>Selected topics and their associated keywords from LDA analysis. We can also observe that the adoption of OIPs varies among firms from the descriptive statistics in Table 3. Some OIPs are adopted by specific firms while they are not adopted by other firms (e.g., the max values of all OIPs are all larger than 0.9 and the min values are 0). Therefore, we further display the average probabilities for different OIPs by industry sector in Table 4. It is clear even from these descriptive statistics that OIPs are not evenly distributed across different sectors of the economy.Selected topics and their associated keywords from LDA analysis.

        <p>In these models, we can also see the contribution of internal R&amp;D effort to Tobin's Q, along with individual OIPs and aggregate openness measure. Internal R&amp;D intensity (shown as RDI in the table) remains significantly and positively associated with Tobin's Q. To further investigate the role of in-house R&amp;D capabilities in amplifying the effect of OIPs on firms' financial performances, we use a set of interaction terms between internal R&amp;D intensity and the overall openness level as well as different OIPs in Model 3 &amp; Model 4. The results about the relationships between open innovation with both aggregate and nuanced levels and financial performance remain consistent with Model 1 and Model 2. In Model 3, the overall openness level is still positively and significantly associated with Tobin's Q, while the interaction term (RDI*OIP_sum) has a negative and significant effect. Model 4 shows that the sign of the effect varies across the OIPs. R&amp;D intensity positively moderates the relationship between OIP2 (Customer engagement) as well as OIP3 (Partnership &amp; joint-venture activities) and firm financial performance, whereas R&amp;D intensity negatively moderates the relationship between OIP1 (Network &amp; community) as well as OIP5 (Contract &amp; IP licensing) and financial performance.

        <p>Inspired by prior studies which conducted empirical investigations on the curvilinear relationship between open innovation and firm financial and innovation performance (e.g., Belderbos et al., 2010;Laursen andSalter, 2006, 2014), we further test curvilinear effects of the overall openness level and individual OIPs on firm financial performance in Table 6 v . Among these models, the coefficient of OIP adoption sum (OIP_sum) is significant and positive to financial performance (Tobin' Q), and the coefficients of most of the individual OIPs are significant and positive to financial performance except OIP3, all of which keep consistent with Table 5's observation.Inspired by prior studies which conducted empirical investigations on the curvilinear relationship between open innovation and firm financial and innovation performance (e.g., Belderbos et al., 2010;Laursen andSalter, 2006, 2014), we further test curvilinear effects of the overall openness level and individual OIPs on firm financial performance in Table 6 v .

        <p>The parameters for the overall openness level (OIP_sum) and almost all individual OIPs except OIP3 are significant and positive, whereas the parameters for their squares are significant and negative. To investigate a curvilinear relationship (an inverted U-shaped relationship for the paradox of openness in our study), a significant and positive coefficient for the independent variable and a significant and negative coefficient for its square are necessary. Based on the three-step procedure proposed by Lind and Mehlum (2010) to establish a quadratic relationship, other two conditions should be met as well: the slope must be sufficiently steep at both ends of the data range and the turning points should be located well within the data range (Haans et al., 2015). We follow the above three steps to formally test the quadratic relationships between open innovation and financial performance (See Table A2 in the appendix).The parameters for the overall openness level (OIP_sum) and almost all individual OIPs except OIP3 are significant and positive, whereas the parameters for their squares are significant and negative.

        <p>We find that the firm's overall openness level is positively associated with firm financial performance (Model 5), rather than showing an inverted U-shape, given its turning point out of its data range. The same situation exists in OIP2 (Customer engagement), which means more customer engagement for open innovation activities is positively associated with improved financial performance (Model 7). For OIP1 (Network &amp; communities), OIP4 (Industry-academia collaboration), and OIP5(Contract &amp; IP licensing), we find strong support for asserting that these individual OIPs are curvilinearshowing an inverted U-shapeassociated with firm financial performance (Model 6, 9 and 10). These models partially support the openness paradox, -when firms adopt these specific OIPs too extensively in their business operations, they will decrease financial gains.We find that the firm's overall openness level is positively associated with firm financial performance (Model 5), rather than showing an inverted U-shape, given its turning point out of its data range.

        <p>We conducted several additional analyses to assess the robustness of our findings. First, we varied the number of topics (i.e., 25, 50, 100) to ensure using companies' annual report to extract information can be a good proxy for measuring OIP adoption. And we also pooled three years of data together into one corpus to enable the LDA algorithm to expand its analysis to 150 topics. The results remain robust and consistent with our findings. Second, we have done further regression analysis for firms with the probability of OIP distribution = 0 and the probability OIP &gt;0 also for robustness checks. Our results remain quite consistent, implying that this is not biasing the estimates we report in our paper. Third, we undertook a manual coding approach to identify the OIPs from our samples (10 random cases of 10 each), and then compared them to the OIPs from LDA results. For instance, we manually read the business section of Adobe Systems Inc and extracted the OIPs that Adobe adopted, comparing these OIPs we identified manually to LDA analysis. Our comparison shows that algorithmically-derived measures and outcomes were nearly identical to the results based on our manual analysis. 4 Fourth, we include several other control variables in our analysis, firm age, firm growth (measured as the natural logarithm of sales in t year divided by sales in t-1 year). Including these control variables restricts the size of our samples, but the results obtained were consistent with the results reported here. Finally, we use Tobit models, which are commonly used in the open innovation research stream (e.g., Laursen and Salter, 2006;Du et al., 2014;Greco et al., 2016) for single or double censored continuous dependent variables (i.e., Tobin's Q as a financial performance indicator in our study), and we found the results are robust and consistent.We conducted several additional analyses to assess the robustness of our findings.

Our results remain quite consistent, implying that this is not biasing the estimates we report in our paper. Third, we undertook a manual coding approach to identify the OIPs from our samples (10 random cases of 10 each), and then compared them to the OIPs from LDA results. For instance, we manually read the business section of Adobe Systems Inc and extracted the OIPs that Adobe adopted, comparing these OIPs we identified manually to LDA analysis. Our comparison shows that algorithmically-derived measures and outcomes were nearly identical to the results based on our manual analysis. 4 Fourth, we include several other control variables in our analysis, firm age, firm growth (measured as the natural logarithm of sales in t year divided by sales in t-1 year). Including these control variables restricts the size of our samples, but the results obtained were consistent with the results reported here. Finally, we use Tobit models, which are commonly used in the open innovation research stream (e.g., Laursen and Salter, 2006;Du et al., 2014;Greco et al., 2016) for single or double censored continuous dependent variables (i.e., Tobin's Q as a financial performance indicator in our study), and we found the results are robust and consistent.</p>
        <p>Our methods allow us to build upon the prior literature showing mixed results regarding the performance impact of open innovation (Cheng and Huizingh, 2014). Our aggregate measure of openness, built from the sum of OIPs, shows that firms benefit from the overall openness level, which is consistent with prior research (e.g., Du et al., 2014;Kafouros and Forsans, 2012;Mazzola et al., 2012). Due to our large corpus and our construction of a keyword basket, we can make more fine-grained measures of individual OIPs, without incurring the limitations noted above in self-reported survey data or archival data.

        <p>For instance, we find the practice related to customer engagement has a stronger positive association with improved financial performance, while the practice related to market-based partnership &amp; joint venture shows a negative effect (Du et al., 2014). Indeed, some practices are even negatively associated with other practices. So this provides one explanation for earlier mixed findings: different practices have different effects on financial performance. At the same time, we also find evidence for the curvilinearity of the impact of open innovation -the inverted U-shape effect not only exists in the relationship between open innovation and firm innovation performance (e.g, Laursen andSalter, 2006, 2014), but also exists in the relationship between some (but not all) specific OIPs and firm financial performance. Different OIPs show various patterns, with some being associated with improved financial performance while others are not. The findings partly support the existence of paradox of openness for some OIPs, as some innovation activities usually require openness, but gaining business benefits require protection (Laursen and Salter, 2014). Similar to many relationships in strategic managementtoo much can be as bad as too little (Haans et al., 2015), the adoption of some specific OIPs also follows this pattern, such as building network and communities, or conducting IP licensing contracts (Laursen and Salter, 2014).For instance, we find the practice related to customer engagement has a stronger positive association with improved financial performance, while the practice related to market-based partnership &amp; joint venture shows a negative effect (Du et al., 2014).

        <p>Our results also suggest that a richer, more granular set of measures for how open innovation is practiced within firms yields further important findings. While most OIPs exhibit a positive association with firm financial performance, some OIPs display a positive association only in specific sectors. The overall openness level and all individual OIPs can only play a positive role in the growth of financial performance to a certain extent (Laursen and Salter, 2014). And the relationship between individual practices is nuanced, with some of them exhibiting a complementary relationship to one another, and others showing a substitutive relationship instead. Still other OIPs involving crowdsourcing, intermediaries and bilateral transactional activities were not discernible from our examination of the corpus of Russell 3000 firms.Our results also suggest that a richer, more granular set of measures for how open innovation is practiced within firms yields further important findings.

        <p>We similarly find nuanced results for the role of internal R&amp;D effort on firm performance: a positive moderation effect of internal R&amp;D on the relationship between open innovation adoption and firm financial performance suggested by prior research overall is not supported. By contrast, we observe a negative moderation effect. The usual story of inhouse R&amp;D capability supporting external research (e.g., Chen et al., 2016) appears to be more complex than a simple positive relationship between internal R&amp;D and external innovation. Individual OIPs are moderated by R&amp;D intensity, but the effect is sometimes positive and other times negative, and also varies by the sector of the economy, making an aggregate measure indeterminate. Thus, there is not a clear-cut answer to the question of whether internal R&amp;D and external searching are complementary or substitutive innovation activities (Hagedoorn and Wang, 2012). This suggests that the complementarity between internal R&amp;D effort and external innovation activities (Cassiman and Veugelers, 2006;Hung and Chou, 2013), may vary with specific OIPs and particular economic sectors. Our results indicate that, if we examine open innovation's impact on firm performance at too aggregate a level, we inadvertently might conflate practices that do influence performance with practices that do not. The interactions between individual OIPs and R&amp;D intensity help to show how nuanced the effect of R&amp;D intensity is with open innovation, and that the effect varies with the OIPs being studied, and the sector in which it is studied. Our research design does not allow us to demonstrate causality in our findings as topic models are unsupervised learning approaches, but our findings are quite consistent with other evidence reported at the project level on open innovation and firm performance where causality is more able to be established. For instance, Du et al. (2014) examined 489 projects of a European manufacturer, and reported that scientifically-based collaborations with universities resulted in different performance outcomes when compared to market-based collaborations. They reported that different kinds of collaborations used different practices, leading to different results. The "open innovation paradox" (Laursen and Salter, 2014) also likely works differently in different contexts. A scientifically-based collaboration with a university, for example, might involve a paradox of whether and when to disclose important research outcomes from technical experiments. Here, IP protection may be of critical importance. A market-based collaboration (Oltra et al., 2018), by contrast, likely focuses on whether and when to disclose information on pricing, availability and servicing, instead of technical experimental data. Therefore, IP may be far less relevant in that context. Our results also showed that this set of practices (Contract &amp; IP licensing OIP) has a smaller association with better financial performance, compared to our other observed OIPs. Different OIPs would therefore yield different results. Moreover, these results might vary by the sector of the economy.We similarly find nuanced results for the role of internal R&amp;D effort on firm performance: a positive moderation effect of internal R&amp;D on the relationship between open innovation adoption and firm financial performance suggested by prior research overall is not supported.

        <p>Another important finding from our empirical analysis is that the specific OIPs vary in their salience by sector. Contracts and IP licensing (OIP5), for instance, is commonly used by most of the sectors, whereas Industry-academia collaboration (OIP4) is found extensively in some sectors (e.g., Heath Care sector), and not at all in other sectors. Technologically intensive sectors like Health Care, for example, tend to conduct research collaborations with universities (OIP4). Sectors that place more emphasis on market knowledge flows than technological knowledge flows, such as the Real Estate sector, on the other hand, seem rather to adopt more partnership &amp; joint venture activities (OIP3). Prior research also showed that different external knowledge search patterns exist in different industries and sectors (e.g., Grimpe and Sofka, 2009).Another important finding from our empirical analysis is that the specific OIPs vary in their salience by sector.

        <p>One explanation for this variance is that different sectors might be in different phases of their industry life cycle (Miles et al., 1993). Sectors in the growth stage of their life cycle (e.g., the Information Technology sector), might experience a high rate of new firm entry, creating additional between-firm heterogeneity (Madsen and Walker, 2002). These differences ultimately lead to substantial variance in profitability (Knott, 2003) across competitors, and thus it is not surprising to see the sectors in the growth stage use more multi-collaborative OIPs (i.e. network &amp; community; customer engagement) with more interactive and dynamic characteristics than other sectors in later stages of the life cycle (Chesbrough, 2011;Radziwon and Bogers, 2019). Sectors in the maturity and decline stages of the life cycle (e.g., Real Estate sector), might experience changes that are less radical and more incremental with more standardized established industry norms (Karniouchina et al., 2013). Partnerships and joint venture activities are commonly adopted to further consolidate their positions as growth diminishes and the industry matures. Therefore, we argue that industry life cycle conditions may be important reasons for these sectoral differences.One explanation for this variance is that different sectors might be in different phases of their industry life cycle (Miles et al., 1993).

        <p>Given that the definition of open innovation involves knowledge flows across organizational boundaries (Chesbrough and Bogers, 2014), it is likely that the speed of those knowledge flows and the rate of knowledge iteration (Eppinger, 2001;Escribano et al., 2009;Schulz, 2001) also influence the salience of individual OIPs. For instance, building strong network &amp; communities (OIP1) and putting customers directly into the innovation process (OIP2) requires more complex and dynamic knowledge flows than other OIPs, because they require close and continuing collaborations (Chesbrough, 2011;Maslowska et al., 2016;Sawhney et al., 2005). In our results, we observe that these two types of OIPs are adopted more by specific sectors such as Information Technology and Communication Service, where the speed of knowledge flows across firm boundaries occurs rapidly in these sectors. There is an important implication from these variations across economic sectors: different OIPs work differently in different parts of the economy. Firms have to make the most appropriate choices from among various options to suit their particular situation. This means that there is likely no single set of Best Practices for open innovation that will be effective across all of the economy.Given that the definition of open innovation involves knowledge flows across organizational boundaries (Chesbrough and Bogers, 2014), it is likely that the speed of those knowledge flows and the rate of knowledge iteration (Eppinger, 2001;Escribano et al., 2009;Schulz, 2001) also influence the salience of individual OIPs.

        <p>Also of interest is what we did not find in our analysis. As noted above, two OIPs, crowdsourcing and use of intermediaries, did not emerge from the NLP analysis of the corpus of annual reports (10-Ks) from the Russell 3000 companies. These non-findings are worth discussing, because both practices are actively studied in the academic literature on open innovation (e.g., Katzy et al., 2013;Lee et al., 2010;Liu et al., 2020;Terwiesch and Xu, 2008). A recent search on 
            <rs type="software">Google Scholar</rs>, for example, returned more than 53,000 citations for "open innovation crowdsourcing". Another search from the same source for "open innovation intermediaries" returned even more citations, 270, 000. This lack of salience in the corpus of the Russell 3000 companies' annual reports (10-Ks) suggests that academics might reflect on where they are allocating their research attention. Our non-finding is consistent with other survey results of the adoption of open innovation in large companies (Brunswicker andChesbrough, 2015, 2018). Those surveys reported that the practices of crowdsourcing and intermediaries were the least important, least used practices of large firms that had adopted open innovation. We have to note that one potential reason is that many firms do not necessarily consider crowdsourcing as open innovation but rather a means for marketing, or perhaps they describe the practices related to crowdsourcing and intermediaries in different ways when reporting financial results. vi Because these NLP methods are new to the study of open innovation, we must be cautious in the interpretation of our non-findings. With a more mature keyword basket that has been tested and validated by other scholars, for example, we might see evidence emerge for these practices. Similarly, if scholars apply our methods to other corpora of text, evidence again might also emerge. We would observe, though, that the extensive use of crowdsourcing did not save Quirky from going bankrupt in 2015. And the large Solver community built by the intermediary InnoCentive nonetheless resulted in the acquisition of InnoCentive at less than 5% of its invested capital in 2019 (Chesbrough, 2019). Such negative outcomes have not been much discussed in the academic literature, yet are consistent with both the survey results of open innovation adoption in large firms (Brunswicker andChesbrough, 2015, 2018), and our own NLP analysis reported here. Therefore, more research is clearly needed to resolve the contrast between the robust academic study of these practices, and the lack of empirical support to date for their effects on financial performance.

        <p>In this paper, we employ NLP and machine learning techniques, which are now actively deployed in other social sciences, and recently have arrived in the field of innovation studies (see Arts et al. (2020) and He et al. (2020) for some of the first analyses as well as Antons et al. (2020) for an overview). We believe that our field should welcome these new methods. These approaches do not require a priori specification of particular relationships, but instead can detect complex patterns in unstructured data. As we have already noted, these methods also avoid some of the biases inherent in collecting innovation data with survey methods, and can extend to more practices than most archival sources allow. While there is a valid concern about the ability to discern causal relationships from these methods, new research is developing that employs NLP methods to support traditional hypothesis testing based upon inspection of data patterns that emerge from an initial analysis (Shrestha et al., 2020;Tidhar and Eisenhardt, 2020). These new methods arrive at a time when our prior research on open innovation and performance have employed measures that have many deficiencies. Not least among these deficiencies are self-reporting bias, common method bias, and (depending on the method) an inability for other scholars to observe and replicate the findings. The NLP methods used in our study yield that results are consistent with earlier research on open innovation, making our findings more plausible. To be sure, NLP methods have their own limitations, as we will discuss below.In this paper, we employ NLP and machine learning techniques, which are now actively deployed in other social sciences, and recently have arrived in the field of innovation studies (see Arts et al.

        <p>It is also worth remembering the source of the textual data that forms the corpus for our analysis. Annual reports (10-Ks) or quarterly reports (10-Qs) are public documents, and top managers bear personal responsibility for their accuracy and completeness. The SEC regulates the disclosure of public financial information, and there is a deep infrastructure of accounting and auditing processes that enforce a certain amount of consistency in reporting. External stock market analysts further enforce certain reporting norms and expectations. These documents are also painstakingly constructed every quarter and every year. They form the base of all communications between publicly held companies and their investors. These reports are critical documents for companies to detail their financial performance to external investors.It is also worth remembering the source of the textual data that forms the corpus for our analysis.

        <p>Our analysis reveals that a basket of these words contains many keywords and sentences that allow researchers to compile specific OIPs from the words in these documents. These new methods allow us to construct more fine-grained measures of OIPs that can be observed and replicated by others. We offer our keyword basket for inspection to other scholars, with the expectation that these keywords will be refined and improved with additional research efforts. Hopefully, those improvements also will be made publicly available to scholars. In so doing, we may advance our understanding of how open innovation is practiced, and which practices are associated with better business results. NLP techniques can also be applied to other secondary datasets which have been used to extract specific open innovation activities, such as strategic technology agreements (MERIT-CATI dataset), SDC and industrial partnerships (Schilling, 2009).Our analysis reveals that a basket of these words contains many keywords and sentences that allow researchers to compile specific OIPs from the words in these documents.

        <p>We view our results as promising, initial findings. Much more can be done with these methods. In classification tasks, labeled data is a prerequisite for analysis. However, there exist very few mature labeled datasets in management (Kang et al., 2020) and none to our knowledge in open innovation, that would allow the use of labeled data. To improve the quality and accuracy of algorithms, manually coding data is necessary as the first step, which is time-consuming and subject to coding errors. Fortunately, we can combine manual coding and training algorithms together to ensure quality and efficiency (Song et al., 2019). Our study not only introduces these methods to the open innovation literature, it also offers an initial key-word basket for open innovation practices by using companies' language in their financial reporting. Creating, sharing, and augmenting the keyword basket, and deploying these baskets across other business documents, will doubtless provide additional findings about open innovation and financial performance. Once we have robust classification data, we can begin to employ supervised learning methods, in addition to the topic modelling methods shown here.We view our results as promising, initial findings.

        <p>Our study and these new methods have some important limitations that must be kept in mind. While we are studying the relationship between open innovation and financial performance, we mainly focus on the initial steps of carefully introducing the novel text-based approach as well as creating a key-word basket foundation for future research. Our analysis lacks the identification needed to demonstrate causality for our claims. Another limitation is that many companies do not provide detailed discussion of their innovation practices and performance in their annual reports (10-Ks). Indeed, many do not even report R&amp;D expenditures. Other corpus of text might provide greater evidence of the value of crowdsourcing, open innovation intermediaries and bilateral transactional activities, for example. Our corpus has its own limitation, as firms will mainly talk about the important practices in their business sections, and they may remove other activities such as crowdsourcing in their reports. Other textual sources of data would be helpful for scholars to further investigate companies' innovation practices.Our study and these new methods have some important limitations that must be kept in mind.

        <p>The modelling strategy we used with NLP methods and topic modelling have the usual risk of "garbage in, garbage out". This means that scholars employing these methods must pay close attention to their inputs, lest they generate more garbage than they intend. In our study, we set up a primary annotated word basket which can advance the research of measuring OIPs. We will share our keyword basket with all interested researchers, and hope to construct an open-source resource (see the repository on GitHub: Measuring_OIPs) that would allow others to share and test their own keyword baskets with academic researchers. Due to the laborious process of labeling work, our initial keyword basket is likely to be incomplete and cannot cover all OIP-related phrases comprehensively. Better, more widely shared keyword baskets will reduce the amount of "garbage in", and therefore reduce the amount of "garbage out" in future analyses.The modelling strategy we used with NLP methods and topic modelling have the usual risk of "garbage in, garbage out".

Our approach can identify the incidence and salience of open innovation practices, but cannot demonstrate the causal effects of these practices. A more longitudinal analysis would allow researchers to track the patterns of adoption of OIPs over time by firm, and better identify the relationship of those practices to improved firm performance.A third limitation is that this analysis is essentially a cross-sectional analysis, limited to three years of pooled observational data (2016-2019) with fixed year effects.

        <p>A final limitation is to note that NLP models are rapidly advancing. It will be important to ensure that our studies are robust to alternative specifications of the keyword basket for OIPs and alternative methodologies to train algorithms to analyze those practices across other datasets. To the best of our knowledge, the prior literature in open innovation literature has not yet built up a research foundation by using NLP algorithms to develop new ways to measure open innovation. For example, no annotated text-based dataset exists for NLP analysis, where labeled data plays a central role in supervised learning. Therefore, we consider our work as an initial step, which, while it can be improved further, is a valuable starting point. We encourage scholars to further develop the labeled data (i.e., labelling sentences rather than just words or phrases) based on our work, which would enable the use of more advanced NLP models (i.e., supervising learning algorithms) to do further analyses. It will be important to experiment with these other techniques to identify those that generate the best signal-to-noise ratio in analyzing textual data to extract information on innovation practices.A final limitation is to note that NLP models are rapidly advancing.

        <p>Despite the popularity of open innovation in recent years, performance results from the practice of open innovation in the academic literature have been mixed. Measuring and observing open innovation is usually done either in isolation, such as studying a single practice, or in the aggregate, such as employing proxy measures, whereby most of them are based on a survey approach. Based on these proxies, there is not sufficient research investigating the relationship between nuanced open innovation practices and firm financial performance. There are differing claims in the literature on the performance of open innovation, and the evidence used to support these claims often suffers from a number of biases or other limitations.Despite the popularity of open innovation in recent years, performance results from the practice of open innovation in the academic literature have been mixed.

        <p>We employ a new technique that utilizes natural language processing operating on unstructured data to extract information on companies' open innovation practices, to provide a complementary data source and a new method to revisit the relationship between open innovation and firm financial performance. These methods can avoid some of the limitations of earlier methods, utilizing textual data from their annual financial reports. These reporting documents are taken quite seriously both inside the firm and outside the firm. By using these reports as the corpus, the findings overall are quite consistent with prior empirical research on open innovationopen innovation practices in the aggregate level are indeed associated with improved firm performance. We also find evidence for the curvilinearity of the impact of some of these practices (but not all). Our use of NLP allows us to go further, and shed additional light on what may be driving the disparate results in the prior literature, and the open innovation paradox. The plausibility of our findings should provide some comfort to skeptical readers, who might question the validity of NLP methods in understanding open innovation, while also providing more deeper understanding about open innovation adoption. Our results also confirm the complementarity between internal R&amp;D and some specific OIPs but not others, which suggests there is not a clear-cut answer to the relationship between internal R&amp;D effort and open innovation activities. Moreover, the effect of these practices upon firm financial performance varies with the industrial sector in which they are observed. Thus, it is unlikely that there will be a single set of Best Practices for open innovation that would be equally effective across all sectors in the economy. We invite other scholars to build on these methods, to advance our understanding of whether, how and where open innovation influences firm performance, across different practices and across different parts of the economy.We employ a new technique that utilizes natural language processing operating on unstructured data to extract information on companies' open innovation practices, to provide a complementary data source and a new method to revisit the relationship between open innovation and firm financial performance.

        <p>i More information about different measures in prior empirical studies can be found in the Appendix Table A1. We received a number of queries from anonymous reviewers to substantiate certain claims in our paper, and have developed the Appendix Table to provide this information. ii We were also inspired by recent research in the analysis of ESG influences upon firm performance. While early studies utilized thirdparty ratings of ESG behavior to evaluate a firm's governance, more recent work has deployed NLP techniques to extract this information from firms' communications directly. iii We are indebted to an anonymous reviewer for many of the studies shown in this table, which expanded an already large number of studies that were included in an earlier draft of the manuscript. iv One of our intentions for this paper is to start the process of building a more mature labeled dataset of open innovation practices. Such a dataset will allow other researchers to examine other corpuses of data with a commonly shared set of labels for open innovation practices, as well as replicating the analyses we report here v We wish to express our thanks to an anonymous reviewer for the suggestion to test curvilinear effects of open innovation on firm financial performance, so that we can connect more directly with prior literature about the mixed results on financial performance. vi Thanks to an anonymous reviewer for providing a possible reason of why companies don't report crowdsourcing activities in their annual report, or why we cannot capture the crowdsourcing practices by using topic models.i More information about different measures in prior empirical studies can be found in the Appendix Table A1.
