        <p>AI has received increased attention from the information systems (IS) research community in recent years. There is, however, a growing concern that research on AI could experience a lack of cumulative building of knowledge, which has overshadowed IS research previously. This study addresses this concern, by conducting a systematic literature review of AI research in IS between 2005 and 2020. The search strategy resulted in 1877 studies, of which 98 were identified as primary studies and a synthesise of key themes that are pertinent to this study is presented. In doing so, this study makes important contributions, namely (i) an identification of the current reported business value and contributions of AI, (ii) research and practical implications on the use of AI and (iii) opportunities for future AI research in the form of a research agenda.AI has received increased attention from the information systems (IS) research community in recent years.

        <p>AI has been claimed to offer transformational potential across sectors and industries, ranging from supply chain management (Chi, Huang, &amp; George, 2020;Collins, Youngdahl, Jamison, Mobasher, &amp; Gini, 1998;Nissen &amp; Sengupta, 2006;Rodriguez-Aguilar, Martin, Noriega, Garcia, &amp; Sierra, 1998) to medicine (Ali, Shrestha, Soar, &amp; Wamba, 2018;Cepolina &amp; Muscolo, 2014;Mettler, Sprenger, &amp; Winter, 2017;Wang, Savkin, Clout, &amp; Nguyen, 2015) to automobiles (Lugano, 2017). Studies have reported that AI provides opportunities to reinvent business models (Duan, Edwards, &amp; Dwivedi, 2019), change the future of work (Schwartz et al., 2019), performance improvements (Wilson &amp; Daugherty, 2018), and even enhance human capabilities (Dwivedi, et al., 2021).AI has been claimed to offer transformational potential across sectors and industries, ranging from supply chain management (Chi, Huang, &amp; George, 2020;Collins, Youngdahl, Jamison, Mobasher, &amp; Gini, 1998;Nissen &amp; Sengupta, 2006;Rodriguez-Aguilar, Martin, Noriega, Garcia, &amp; Sierra, 1998) to medicine (Ali, Shrestha, Soar, &amp; Wamba, 2018;Cepolina &amp; Muscolo, 2014;Mettler, Sprenger, &amp; Winter, 2017;Wang, Savkin, Clout, &amp; Nguyen, 2015) to automobiles (Lugano, 2017).

        <p>There are a few reasons attributed to this upswing in AI interest in recent years (von Krogh, 2018). The past few decades have seen tremendous advancements in some of the underlying AI methods such as current and convential neural networks, many of which have been made open-source and thus available to everyone. AI requires extensive and sophisticated computation, so the decreasing cost in computer hardware and dedicated AI chip designs is making it much more feasible and thus attractive to organisations. The expansion of cloud-based services related to AI has also made it much more attainable for organisations would otherwise be hesitant. Additionally, while research is still in the early stages, preliminary studies may be showing that the advent of COVID has also increased interest in AI, as people get used to the reduced human element in all levels of society and the increased use of automation (Coombs, 2020;Sipior, 2020).There are a few reasons attributed to this upswing in AI interest in recent years (von Krogh, 2018).

        <p>AI has a history much longer than is commonly understood, in fields from science and philosophy ranging all the way back to ancient Greece (Dennehy, 2020), but its modern iteration owes much to Alan Turing (Turing, 1950) and conference in Dartmouth College in 1956(McCorduck, 2004), where the term "Artificial Intelligence" was officially coined and defined by John McCarthy at the time as "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines". Russel and Norvig (2020) referred to it as the "the birth of artificial intelligence." One of the initial paradigms of AI was that it revolved around high-level cognition. Not the ability to recognise concepts, perceive objects, or execute complex motor skills shared by most animals, but the potential to engage in multi-step reasoning, to understand the meaning of natural language, to design innovative artefacts, to generate novel plans that achieve goals, and even to reason about their own reasoning (Langley, 2011). This general human like intelligence was referred to as strong AI (Kurzweil, 2005). For strong AI, the primary approach has centred on symbolic reasoning, that computers are not simply numeric calculators but rather general symbol manipulators. As noted by Newell and Simon (1976) in their physical symbol system hypothesis, intelligent behaviour appears to require the ability to interpret and manipulate symbolic structures. While this approach showed promise initially (Newell &amp; Simon, 1963), many branches of AI have retreated from this approach due its difficulty and the lack of progress coming in to the 21 st century. It remains yet uncertain on when and if strong AI will be made a reality.AI has a history much longer than is commonly understood, in fields from science and philosophy ranging all the way back to ancient Greece (Dennehy, 2020), but its modern iteration owes much to Alan Turing (Turing, 1950) and conference in Dartmouth College in 1956(McCorduck, 2004), where the term "Artificial Intelligence" was officially coined and defined by John McCarthy at the time as "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines".

        <p>The distinction between weak AI and strong AI is also concerned with rule adherence, i.e., the way machines interact with rules. Wolfe (1991) distinguishes rule-based decision making in which machines strictly respect the rules set by developers from rule following decision making which machines follow rules that have not been strictly specified to them. Rule-based decision-making matches weak AI, while rule-following decision making is an attempt that tends towards strong AI. An example of rule-following decision making is neural networks (NN), which allow algorithms to learn from themselves. Strong AI would be machines making their own rules and then follow them, which is not possible at the stage of right now (Wolfe, 1991).The distinction between weak AI and strong AI is also concerned with rule adherence, i.e., the way machines interact with rules.

        <p>AI has gone through many peaks and troughs since its early inception in the 1950s, usually referred to as AI "summers and winters" (Russel and Norvig, 2020). Since 2010, however, AI can be said to have once again entered a summer period, mainly due to considerable improvements in the computing power of computers and the access to massive amounts of data (PWC, 2019).This resurgence in AI research is the result of three breakthroughs: (1) the introduction of a much more sophisticated class of algorithms; (2) the arrival on the market of low-cost graphics processors capable of performing large amounts of calculations in a few milliseconds; and (3) the availability of very large, correctly annotated databases allowing for more sophisticated learning of intelligent systems (Jain, Ross, &amp; Prabhakar, 2004;Khashman, 2009;PWC, 2019).AI has gone through many peaks and troughs since its early inception in the 1950s, usually referred to as AI "summers and winters" (Russel and Norvig, 2020).

        <p>Despite the length of time the field has existed, there is still no commonly accepted definition (Allen, 1998;Bhatnagar et al., 2018;Brachman, 2006;Hearst &amp; Hirsh, 2000;Nilsson, 2009). This is not considered a problem yet, as many scientific concepts only get true definitions after they have matured enough, rather than at their conception, and given the complexity and breadth of AI, it may not be feasible to expect AI to have a set definition yet. Still, this doesn't mean that the topic should be ignored, especially with the recent advancements and advancements relating to the field (LeCun, Bengio, &amp; Hinton, 2015;Silver et al., 2016). However, without a clear definition of the term, "it is difficult for policymakers to assess what AI systems will be able to do in the near future, and how the field may get there. There is no common framework to determine which kinds of AI systems are even desirable" (Bhatnagar et al., 2018). A similar concern has been echoed by Monett and Lewis (2018), that "theories of intelligence and the goal of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) have been the source of much confusion both within the field and among the general public".Despite the length of time the field has existed, there is still no commonly accepted definition (Allen, 1998;Bhatnagar et al., 2018;Brachman, 2006;Hearst &amp; Hirsh, 2000;Nilsson, 2009).

        <p>In the years immediately preceding and after the 1956 Dartmouth conference where the term was coined, when the concept for AI was first brewing in academic consciousness, many researchers (would later become famous for their contributions to AI) formulated many theories and proposals that focused on the common features of mind and (McCulloch &amp; Pitts, 1943;Turing, 1950;von Neumann, 1958;Wiener, 1948). While these thought leaders were influential, the field of AI as we know it owes more to McCarthy, Minsky, Newell, and Simon. While this is partly due to their own attendance of the famous 1951 Dartmouth conference, it is likely more since they went on to establish three leading research centres which shaped the stream of though regarding AI for years.

        <p>Despite the heightened interest in AI (Watson, 2017), it is claimed that there is a noticeable absence of theoretically-grounded research on how organisations should develop their digital business strategies incorporating AI to create business (Mikalef, Bourab, Lekakosb, &amp; Krogstiea, 2019). We investigate this claim and identify gaps in AI research conducted by IS scholars. We acknowledge four previous Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) have been conducted (Hofmann, Oesterle, Rust, &amp; Urbach, 2019;Rzpeka &amp; Berger, 2018;Borges, Laurindo, Spínola, Gonçalves, &amp; Mattos, 2021;Karger, 2020) but highlight limitations of these studies (see Table 1).Despite the heightened interest in AI (Watson, 2017), it is claimed that there is a noticeable absence of theoretically-grounded research on how organisations should develop their digital business strategies incorporating AI to create business (Mikalef, Bourab, Lekakosb, &amp; Krogstiea, 2019).

        <p>The literature review conducted by Rzpeka and Berger (2018) cited 91 studies total as their primary studies, taken from a combination of conferences and journals. However, it is focused on the context of individual user interaction with AI systems in IS, while this study studies how it is being defined and gives value. The literature review conducted by Hofmann et al. (2019) was primarily concerned with the effects of AI and ML in the context of the radiology value chain, and so had a time span reflecting that, focusing on 2012 to 2018. The review conducted by Borges et al. (2021) focused more on specific AI interactions with organisational strategy and so misses some of the context in how it is being defined and how it creates value. The literature review conducted by Karger (2020) is focused narrowly on the relations between AI and blockchain and excludes everything else. This study includes all the relevant studies in a fifteen year period in a number of high quality journals and conferences, and includes studies that use AI in more oblique ways than these SLRs, such as studies that use machine learning approaches when researching their focus.The literature review conducted by Rzpeka and Berger (2018) cited 91 studies total as their primary studies, taken from a combination of conferences and journals.

        <p>The current difficulty to settle on an agreed definition of AI has been discussed above, but for the purposes of this systematic literature review, we focus on functions of AI as described by Dejoux and Léon (2018). The broad range of functions is shown in Table 2 below. Already, studies are showing the potential opportunities of adopting AI in a wide range of fields, with manufacturing, digital marketing and healthcare generating considerable academic interest (Juniper Research, 2018). For manufacturing, factories are likely to extensively use AI as product automation increases and industry uses more AI and cyber physical systems (Wang &amp; Wang, 2016). Healthcare researchers propose using AI systems linked to sensors placed on humans to monitor and record their health (Rubik &amp; Jabs, 2018). For digital marketing, Juniper Research (2018) predicts that demand forecasting using AI will more than treble between 2019 and 2023 and that chatbot interactions will reach 22 billion in the same year from current levels of 2.6 billion. However, these opportunities are only available if one can undertsand what AI is.The current difficulty to settle on an agreed definition of AI has been discussed above, but for the purposes of this systematic literature review, we focus on functions of AI as described by Dejoux and Léon (2018).

        <p>This section outlines the systematic review process adopted for this study. A Systematic Literature Review is defined as "means of identifying, evaluating and interpreting all available research relevant to a particular research question, or topic area, or phenomenon of interest" (Kitchenham, 2004). This systematic approach was chosen for its ability to offer reviews of high quality (Dingsøyr &amp; Dybå, 2008) and transparent and replicable review (Leidner &amp; Kayworth, 2006). Additionally, it is useful for studies with a clearly formulated research question (Petticrew &amp; Roberts, 2006) and summarising large quantities of research studies (Fink, 2005). Thus, the SLR was chosen for the following reasons: (i) the study will generate large amounts of literature; (ii) this study aims to answer a specific research question; (iii) we intend to systematically extract relevant AI references from the studies transparently; and (iv) the rigour and replicability it offers leads to an unbiased scientific study. The foundation of our guide was taken from the guideline developed by Okoli (2015). Okoli (2015) propose a systematic review process that consists of 8 steps, namely planning (2 steps), selection (2 steps), extraction (2 steps) and execution (2 steps) that are completed across 4 phases (see Fig. 1.). Each of these four phases and eight steps are discussed in detail in the remainder of the section.This section outlines the systematic review process adopted for this study.

        <p>A literature review's quality is dependent on the rigor of the search process (Vom Brocke et al., 2009). Therefore, the search strategy is best developed in concert with the research question. The goal is to find as many studies as possible capable of answering the research question (Kitchenham &amp; Charters, 2007). The starting point when searching literature is electronic sources and literature databases, followed by a keyword string search to locate the appropriate studies (Levy &amp; Ellis, 2006).A literature review's quality is dependent on the rigor of the search process (Vom Brocke et al., 2009).

        <p>A generally accepted approach to search string strategy is to base the search string on the research questions and include a list of synonyms, abbreviations, and alternative spellings (Kitchenham &amp; Charters, 2007). Due to the nature of Artificial Intelligence and the variety of different types, subtypes, and methods in use, in addition to the different ways it is referred to by researchers, a thorough strategy was needed. The search string was used following the Boolean practice. A simple "OR" operator was used between keywords. The use of "*" after some word was implemented so the search would include multiple variations of the word. The use of quotation marks ("") over some terms was to exclusively search for that specific term.A generally accepted approach to search string strategy is to base the search string on the research questions and include a list of synonyms, abbreviations, and alternative spellings (Kitchenham &amp; Charters, 2007).

        <p>For each of the three selected databases (AIS eLibrary, Scopus, ISI Web of Science), using the specified search string retrieves an initial list of studies. One or many of these databases had been used by multiple researchers in the literature (Agarwal, Kumar, &amp; Goel, 2019;Busalim &amp; Hussin, 2016;Gupta, Kar, Baabdullah, &amp; Al-Khowaiter, 2018;Rekik, Kallel, Casillas, &amp; Alimi, 2018) The records are first imported into 
            <rs type="software">Endnote</rs> for sorting and categorisation, and then further imported into 
            <rs type="creator">Microsoft</rs>
            <rs type="software">Excel</rs> sheet format. The basic input includes meta-data such as (i) title, (ii) author, (iii) year, (iv) publication type, and (v) abstract. The keyword strategy was applied to nine IS journals and the top two IS conferences. The search string used across the three databases retrieved 1877 studies (shown in Table 4).
        </p>
        <p>Once the literature searches in leading journals have commenced, the leading conferences of a field should follow (Webster &amp; Watson, 2002). Due to the multidisciplinary nature of IS literature is heavily dispersed across different data sources (Levy &amp; Ellis, 2006). To ensure all relevant studies were retrieved, three databases were used, these being (i) AIS eLibrary; (ii) Scopus, and (iii) the ISI Web of Science. AIS eLibrary was used as of the databases used it was unique in being able to provide studies from the leading IS conferences. Scopus was used as it claims to be largest database for abstracts and citations (Ballew, 2009;Kitchenham &amp; Charters, 2007). ISI Web of Science was used as it is the largest citation database which stores over 800 million references (Manikandan &amp; Amsaveni, 2016).Once the literature searches in leading journals have commenced, the leading conferences of a field should follow (Webster &amp; Watson, 2002).

        <p>These databases were used to retrieve studies from relevant IS journals, which were chosen as we belief these nine journals focus on the social-technological aspects of AI, which is the scope of this SLR. Conference papers from two of the leading IS conferences, namely, International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS) and the European Conference on Information Systems (ECIS) were also retrieved and analysed. The number of papers retrieved from each selected database is shown in Table 5.These databases were used to retrieve studies from relevant IS journals, which were chosen as we belief these nine journals focus on the social-technological aspects of AI, which is the scope of this SLR.

        <p>Screening of the retrieved studies was achieved by following the best practices proposed by Kitchenham (2004) and Dingsøyr and Dybå (2008). The study selection process used in this study is illustrated in Fig. 1. Two authors independently analysed the 1877 studies to remove (i) duplicate studies, (ii) non-English studies, (iii) non-IS studies, and (iv) non-peer reviewed scientific studies (books, book chapters, experience reports). As searching through literature can result in many studies, using an inclusion and exclusion criteria can serve to eliminate unnecessary studies (Okoli, 2015).Screening of the retrieved studies was achieved by following the best practices proposed by Kitchenham (2004) and Dingsøyr and Dybå (2008).

        <p>Fig. 2 shows the study selection process. After the initial step of identifying a search string was complete, pilot steps were carried out on the databases used. This entailed refining the search string for each database. However, the terms used to search the databases were used the same throughout. The lead author analysed the 1877 studies retrieved in the initial search. A second reviewer was invited to analyse these studies as well, to pre-emptively combat potential bias. The two reviewers had to agree for a study to stay a primary study. Based on the removal of duplicates, non-scientific and non-English studies, 91 were removed, leaving 1786. These 1786 studies were then analysed based on title. The title gave a clear indication on whether they were outside the focus of the study, and thus excluded. If a title did not clearly reveal application domain of the study it was included for review in the subsequent steps, where title, keywords and abstract were examined. Based on title, abstract and keyword, the 1786 studies were further narrowed down to 187. There were still cases where the abstract was unclear, so these studies carried onto the next stage, where the contents of the full study were examined. An in-depth examination of the 187 remaining studies was undertook by the reviewers, which resulted in a further 90 studies being excluded. This resulted in a total of 98 primary studies used as the basis of this SLR.Fig. 2 shows the study selection process.

        <p>There are always several common threats to validity concerning SLRs (Petersen, Vakkalanka, &amp; Kuzniarz, 2015;Wohlin et al., 2012). This section considers those threats and outlines the strategies used to combat and mitigate them, as well as explores the limitations of this study. The validity framework by Wohlin et al. (2012) examines validity threats in terms of (i) construct validity, (ii) external validity, (iii) internal validity, and (iv) conclusion validity. Construct validity states that the author must attain the right measures for the concept under study (Petersen, Vakkalanka, &amp; Kuzniarz, 2015;Wohlin, et al., 2012). To minimise this threat, this SLR followed a structured eight-step guideline required to conduct a scientifically rigorous SLR, as seen in Fig. 1. Within those guidelines was the paper selection process (see Fig. 2.) which documents the process of filtering studies from the original 1877 to the 98 primary studies. To further mitigate this threat, authors three and four were experienced in reviewing studies and acted as external reviewers to validate the research protocol. This, this threat has been significantly neutralised.There are always several common threats to validity concerning SLRs (Petersen, Vakkalanka, &amp; Kuzniarz, 2015;Wohlin et al., 2012).

        <p>To know to what degree the results of a study can be generalised it is essential that the research process is described (Petersen &amp; Wohlin, 2009). As this systematic study followed the eight-step guideline laid out by (Okoli, 2015), it is attributed to mitigating the threats to validity. Internal validity relates to causal relationships and ensuring that it is not a result of a factor that was not measured, or the researcher had no control over. As the aims of this study were not to establish a statistical causal relationship on AI in IS, other mitigations were used to combat it, such as regular meetings with all authors to explore any potential of bias. Conclusion validity relates to bias of the researchers in the interpretation of that data. While this risk cannot be eliminated, several measures were taken to combat it; (i) three authors were involved in data extraction of the primary studies, (ii) a full 'audit trail' from the initial 1877 studies to the identification of 98 primary studies was provided, and (iii) conclusions drawn from analysis of the 98 primary studies involved all authors.To know to what degree the results of a study can be generalised it is essential that the research process is described (Petersen &amp; Wohlin, 2009).

Fig. 4. reveals that studies on AI remained relatively low for most of this period, with a total of 11 studies between the years 2005 and 2015. 2019 and 2020 show an immense surge in AI related studies in IS, signifying a much greater interest in the field.

Table 7 shows that 32 of the primary studies were published in journals and 65 were published in the top two IS conferences. The highest number of studies were published in ICIS, a total of 41 studies over the 15-year period. The journal with the most studies was IJIM with 14 studies, especially notable as the scope for IJIM was five years in comparison to the 15 years of the other journals.The aim of this research question is to identify the main channels where AI studies are disseminated.

        <p>The aim of this research question is to identify and categorise the contributions of the primary studies. These contributions (see Table 10), adapted from Shaw (2003) and Paternoster, Giardino, Unterkalmsteiner, Gorschek, and Abrahamsson (2014) include six types of contributions, namely (i) framework, method, technique, (ii) guidelines, (iii) lessons learned, (iv) model, (v) tool, and (vi) advice/implication.The aim of this research question is to identify and categorise the contributions of the primary studies.

        <p>Although several primary studies could potentially contribute to more than type one contribution type, the categorisation used in this systematic literature review is based on the primary contribution as stated by the authors of each of the 98 primary studies. A visual representation of the contribution types of the primary studies is shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5. shows that 'lessons learned' (40 studies) and 'methods' (26 studies) are the most popular contribution of AI studies in IS research. A limitation to these contributions is that they can often be context specific, especially for the methods contributions. This is compounded upon by AI encompassing such a broad array of uses and designs. This means there is less repetition of contributions and lessons learned, and that cumulative building of knowledge in this context may take time to accumulate. For example, a study that proposes a new framework for improving the radiology supply chain may not be aligned with a study that examines how AI can improve drug innovation. The aim of this research question is to categorise studies on AI based on the type of AI used in the primary study. It is possible to combine a variety of these types together into a single AI system. For example, IBM's Watson combines NLP, ML and machine vision techniques (Jarrahi, 2018a, 2018b). However, for the purpose of this SLR, the study will be categorised solely based on the primary AI type of the study (see Fig. 6.).Although several primary studies could potentially contribute to more than type one contribution type, the categorisation used in this systematic literature review is based on the primary contribution as stated by the authors of each of the 98 primary studies.

It is possible to combine a variety of these types together into a single AI system. For example, IBM's Watson combines NLP, ML and machine vision techniques (Jarrahi, 2018a, 2018b). However, for the purpose of this SLR, the study will be categorised solely based on the primary AI type of the study (see Fig. 6.).</p>
        <p>Fig. 6 shows that ML is the most popular form of AI used in the primary studies, with 69 studies categorised under it. There was less range between the other types, expert systems having 11, machine vision with five and NLP at 6. Robotics was the least common with 3 studies having it as the primary focus. The studies corresponding to each category can be seen on Table 12. There were a few studies that couldn't be said to have focused on any one category specifically, instead looking at AI in the broader sense. These 14 studies that could not be sorted cleanly into the framework were simply categorised as "other".Fig. 6 shows that ML is the most popular form of AI used in the primary studies, with 69 studies categorised under it.

        <p>Contributions across studies. (Davenport &amp; Ronanki, 2018). In this study, we map the 98 primary studies to these three business needs (see Table 13). We acknowledge that it is possible that for some of these studies using AI could result in more than a single value type; however, to avoid complexity, they were mapped to the most relevant category. Fig. 7. shows that the most common value type for AI was process automation (47 studies), followed by cognitive insight (32 studies). Cognitive engagement was reported with the lowest number of studies (17 studies).Contributions across studies. (Davenport &amp; Ronanki, 2018).

        <p>This section summarises the findings of the SLR and highlights some areas that research to date has focused and the key findings from these studies. It is then followed by a discussion on the theoretical contributions and implications for practice. The overall goal is to uncover themes that are relevant for research and practice and identify areas which warrant further research. This section will discuss relevant insights we found from the literature, starting with the lack of cohesion around the definition of AI, the resurgence of AI interest and research in recent years, the specific contribution types of AI literature, and the disproportionate focus on machine learning and process automation.This section summarises the findings of the SLR and highlights some areas that research to date has focused and the key findings from these studies.

        <p>In this study we conducted a SLR that provides a comprehensive overview on AI in IS related studies. By using a systematic literature review, we identified, classified, and analysed 1877 studies on AI and ML in IS that were published between 2005 and 2020. Of these, 98 were identified as primary studies, after a rigorous filtering process. To understand the fundamentals of AI in IS we examined and studied the articles based on studies by year, publication channel, research methods used, and their contribution to IS contributions research. Prior to commencing this task however, we had to consider the problem that the definitions of artificial intelligence were largely varied and ambiguous.In this study we conducted a SLR that provides a comprehensive overview on AI in IS related studies.

        <p>This study identified a lack of cohesion when defining AI, with as many as 28 definitions being used is the respective studies. While the background research elaborated in section 2 shows this is not uncommon when concerning AI, it raises a concern that there is a high risk that IS studies on AI could experience a lack of cumulative building of knowledge (Fitzgerald &amp; Adam, 2000). This resonates with the issue of 'fragmented adhocracy', which has previously overshadowed IS research (Banville &amp; Landry, 1989;Hirschheim, Klein, &amp; Lyytinen, 1996).This study identified a lack of cohesion when defining AI, with as many as 28 definitions being used is the respective studies.

        <p>The most common definition for AI seen was derived from Russel &amp; Norvig, though the specific edition varied, followed by LeCun et al. (2015) and Rai et al. (2019) with two occurrences each. Looking at the definitions gathered from the primary studies, there seems to be a trend where AI is defined more in what its capabilities are rather than strictly defining what it is. Russel and Norvig (2020) defined it as something that "enables the machine to exhibit human intelligence, including the ability to perceive, reason, learn, and interact, etc." for example, while Stone et al. (2016) refers to it as "a science and a set of computational technologies that are inspired by-but typically operate quite differently from-the ways people […] sense, learn, reason, and take action". This means that the definitions of AI often end up being quite similar, even if they are taken from a separate source. While defining AI is outside the scope of this study, the most robust definition of AI in the context of IS research is provided by Rai et al. (2019) who define it as "the ability of a machine to perform cognitive functions that we associate with human minds, such as perceiving, reasoning, learning, interacting with the environment, problem solving, decision-making, and even demonstrating creativity".The most common definition for AI seen was derived from Russel &amp; Norvig, though the specific edition varied, followed by LeCun et al.

        <p>However, there may be issues with how IS research is approaching the defining of AI as there seems to be a believe that there is a true (i.e., real, natural) meaning of "intelligence" that AI research projects should abide by, at least among those that consider defining AI. Yet "intelligence" by its dictionary definition today was formed long before AI, and therefore strictly about human intelligence, where the various levels (conscious and subconscious) are unified, which is not the case for computer intelligence. For human intelligence, structure, behaviour, capability, and function are all relatively unified, while for AI these aspects are commonly pursued in different ways towards different goals. For example, an AI created by mimicking the structure of a human brain and one created by focusing on imitating human behaviour would be end up being very different both in its method and its result. Additionally, human intelligence is developed under certain evolutionary and biological restrictions, which are essential for human, but not really for intelligence in general. After all, "Artificial Intelligence" should not be taken to mean "Artificial Human Intelligence", since "Intelligence" should be a more general notion than "Human Intelligence".However, there may be issues with how IS research is approaching the defining of AI as there seems to be a believe that there is a true (i.e., real, natural) meaning of "intelligence" that AI research projects should abide by, at least among those that consider defining AI.

        <p>Another major concern is the number of studies concerning or using some form of AI that do not define it at all. Of the 98 primary studies, 54 didn't define AI at all. These are primarily the studies that use AI as part of the methodology of their study, often in the case of using some type of machine learning in pursuit of that studies objective. While it is not feasible to ask every researcher, who uses a machine learning technique in their research to dedicate an entire section to AI, the lack of sufficient detail seen in many of the primary studies showcases a possible lack in the cumulative building of knowledge. A related concern is the 7 studies who defined AI by themselves, without sourcing any part it. This is something to be discouraged as much as possible, as it is important both for the individual researchers and for the field as whole to have knowledge built upon clearly and accurately.Another major concern is the number of studies concerning or using some form of AI that do not define it at all.

        <p>Our findings show that while there was a lack of studies in the first decade of the relevant time, there has been a resurgence in recent years. Over half of the primary studies were published in 2019 and 2020. Our findings also show that ICIS published the highest number of studies. ICIS published 41 studies to AI in Information Systems in comparison to the 24 studies published in ECIS. IJIM published 14 primary studies, making them the most published regarding AI in IS journals used in the systematic review.Our findings show that while there was a lack of studies in the first decade of the relevant time, there has been a resurgence in recent years.

        <p>As previously shown in Fig. 4., there was a resurgence in interest in AI in 2017, before it seemed to really expand in 2019 and 2020. It's already been noted that AI research tends to swing between its "winters" and "summers", and it seems clear that we have headed into one of its summer periods in recent years. In 2016, the Economist declared in its June Special Report (The Economist, 2016) that "After many false starts, artificial intelligence has taken off." This was followed by reports released by high level policy makers such as the US and UK governments on future directions and strategy for AI, noting its immense potential but also questions on accountability and use (Government Office for Science, 2016; U.S. National Science and Technology Council, 2016).As previously shown in Fig. 4., there was a resurgence in interest in AI in 2017, before it seemed to really expand in 2019 and 2020.

        <p>This surge of interest in the use of AI among businesses and policy makers naturally resulted in a matching surge in interest among researchers, who now have much more to study due to AIs ever increasing use. This resurgence in AI can be put down to a few reasons. One of the biggest is a convergence of advances in machine learning and big data and graphics processing units (GPUs) which made supervised learning from large datasets much more practical (Morris, Schlenoff, &amp; Srinivasan, 2017). This surge in interest in AI seems to correlate with our own findings, as researchers now have much more access to empirical evidence and AI in use with the advent of this "summer". In the IS community specifically, the increased feasibility of building empirical models from experimental data and using these models to make predictions (the goal of predictive analytics using big data) is likely another reason for the resurgence of interest. However, despite the abundance of research related to machine learning, most of what we found in the literature was related to its technological use in specific domains, whether that domain be healthcare, manufacturing etc. There is a relative lack of research into societal or governmental implications of machine learning and its recent advancements.This surge of interest in the use of AI among businesses and policy makers naturally resulted in a matching surge in interest among researchers, who now have much more to study due to AIs ever increasing use.

        <p>For identifying the contribution types that AI studies have made in IS in the past 15 years, the primary studies were categorised using a framework adapted from Shaw (2003) and Paternoster et al. (2014). The most prominent contribution type among the 98 studies was categorised as "lessons learned" with 40 studies, closely followed by "methods" at 26 and to a lesser extent "advice or implication" at 15. While these findings do show a steady gathering of cumulative knowledge in relating to AI in IS, it also showcases a lack of studies in relation to (i) tools and (ii) models. This is somewhat surprising, as this means there seems to be little interest in IS in researching new and innovative tools relating to AI. Instead, the bulk of the research seems to be focused on using types of AI, primariliy machine learning, to create a particular framework, method, or technique and use that to facilitate the construction and management of software and systems.For identifying the contribution types that AI studies have made in IS in the past 15 years, the primary studies were categorised using a framework adapted from Shaw (2003) and Paternoster et al.

        <p>It seems likely that the reason for this lack of focus on tools or methods is related in some ways to the reasons for the AI resurgence itself noted in section 5.2. That is, the advancement of technology making supervised learning from datasets and machine learning much more feasible means that researchers are now focused on this new foray, and "tools" and "methods" are left to languish because it seems the resurgence doesn't lift up all aspects of AI equally.It seems likely that the reason for this lack of focus on tools or methods is related in some ways to the reasons for the AI resurgence itself noted in section 5.2.

        <p>In terms of studying the categories of AI used, following the framework provided by Dejoux and Léon (2018), machine learning was found to be overwhelmingly prominent in the primary studies, with 69 of the 98 falling under it. Expert systems were the second most studies type of AI with 11 studies categorised as using it. Robotics saw the least use among the primary studies, with 3 studies concerned with it as its main focus. This machine learning dominance seems to be due to, at least in part, the wide variety of contexts in which machine learning is useful in comparison to the other types. For example, many of the primary studies differentiated themselves by using a "machine learning approach" (Meyer et al., 2014;Chatterjee, Saeedfar, Tofangchi, &amp; Kolbe, 2018). In addition, the frequent appearance of machine learning as the AI application used in this paper can be attributed to the fact that it concerns a very broad spectrum of potential applications. Therefore, while the prominence of machine learning may be understandable, it is still a concern. It means there is a relative dearth in studies concerning the other categories under AI, especially robotics. Google Trends show that popularity of the search term for machine learning has surpassed the popularity of AI by almost twice as much (Google Trends, 2020). Additionally, the advances in hardware such as GPUs that has made AI much more feasible in recent years seems to disproportionally favour machine learning, which means more focus from industry and research. For example, text mining relatively inexpensive and can result in a wealth of information if done correctly (He, Zha, &amp; Li, 2013) while there has been some research done on the critical success factors of datamining that is lacking in other areas (Bole, Popovic, Zabkar, Papa, &amp; Jaklic, 2015). This means that some of the other types of AI have received less research focus, though all of them can offer much both practically and academically. For researchers, this seems to have resulted in many more studies approaching research into their own domains using what is often simply called "a machine learning approach" with P1 (Meyers et al., 2014), P13 (Yin, Langenheldt, Harlev, Mukkamala, &amp; Vatrapu, 2019) and P18 (Buettner et al., 2019) just being a few of the many examples.In terms of studying the categories of AI used, following the framework provided by Dejoux and Léon (2018), machine learning was found to be overwhelmingly prominent in the primary studies, with 69 of the 98 falling under it.

        <p>From our own findings here, the papers focused on natural language processing (NLP) have chatbots and similar virtual assistants as a major focus. However, they seem focused on front facing interactions between these agents and customers, and less on actual employees working beside these agents. As chatbots and virtual agents rapidly advance in complexity, there needs to be more research into not just the effects on customers interacting with them, but the human-agent interaction of the people working beside and with them as well.From our own findings here, the papers focused on natural language processing (NLP) have chatbots and similar virtual assistants as a major focus.

        <p>The studies we found that used expert systems (ES) seemed to favour using a hybrid knowledge base using a variety of AI systems, rather than the "classical" method of using just one or more human experts (Kunz, Stelzner, &amp; Williams, 1989). However, it has been noted by other studies that this shift hasn't resulted in a greater impact than earlier systems, despite the advances in technology. This was noted by (Wagner, 2017), who also theorised that the reason for this lack of impact is that the earlier developers were able to capitalise on the 'low hanging fruit' that had bigger impact for organisations.The studies we found that used expert systems (ES) seemed to favour using a hybrid knowledge base using a variety of AI systems, rather than the "classical" method of using just one or more human experts (Kunz, Stelzner, &amp; Williams, 1989).

        <p>Regarding the business value of AI in the primary studies, the results aren't immensely surprising, and in fact align with the findings of Davenport and Ronanki (2018). Just as with (Davenport &amp; Ronanki, 2018), process automation was the most reported business value found because of AI use. This is likely due to process automation being both the least expensive and the easiest to implement of the three value types discussed here (Davenport &amp; Ronanki, 2018). Adopters of RPA have noted the automation can radically transform back offices, delivering much lower costs while improving service quality, and decreasing delivery times, as well as freeing up employees from tedious tasks so they can focus on more important, challenging, and varied work (Lacity, Willcocks, &amp; Andrew, 2015). For the primary studies, this often took the form of the authors using some form of automated ML data mining. Another example would be P36, a paper which studied the application of machine learning in decision support systems and found that the primary value was in acquiring and refining the knowledge used as the basis of the decision, rather than it make decisions themselves, noted in the study for being much more difficult (Merkert, Mueller, &amp; Hubl, 2015).Regarding the business value of AI in the primary studies, the results aren't immensely surprising, and in fact align with the findings of Davenport and Ronanki (2018).

        <p>Cognitive insight was the second most common type of derived business value among the primary studies and was described by Davenport and Ronanki (2018) as "analytics on steroids". Organisations that used such applications of AI find their value in performing and enhancing tasks only machines can do. Among the primary studies of this study, P55 would be a good standout of this, studying the use of deep learning to enhance customer targeting effectiveness (Zhang &amp; Luo, 2019). The paper asserted that given some pilot tests deep learning models would be superior in sales performance compared to the more common industry practices of targeting customers by past purchase frequency or spending amount. These activities involve data analysis at such speeds and at volumes that no human would be possible to process.Cognitive insight was the second most common type of derived business value among the primary studies and was described by Davenport and Ronanki (2018) as "analytics on steroids".

        <p>Cognitive engagement applications of AI were the value attributed to the least number of primary studies within our sample. This is likely partly due to the cognitive engagement dealing more with customers, and businesses being more conservative with customer facing technology (Davenport &amp; Ronanki, 2018). The idea of having frustrating conversions with a chat-bot that just can't seem to understand what the user is saying still quite strong in the public consciousness, never mind the high-profile failures such as Taybot (Badjatiya, Gupta, Gupta, &amp; Varma, 2017).Cognitive engagement applications of AI were the value attributed to the least number of primary studies within our sample.

        <p>Our findings provide an overview of the current state of research when it comes to AI use in the organisational setting, but also helps to draw some interesting points for future research. One of the main findings in our synthesis concerned the lack of definitions when it comes to AI in empirical studies. Since AI applications cover a breadth of different techniques, technologies, and set a different set of requirements on data, infrastructure and leveraging them in the organisational setting it is important that future research accurately frames the definition of AI that is used. Apart from enabling a better comparison between empirical works, clearly articulating definitions can also allow for a better understanding of the assumptions and constraints that characterise the body of work.Our findings provide an overview of the current state of research when it comes to AI use in the organisational setting, but also helps to draw some interesting points for future research.

        <p>Adding to the above, the different applications of AI largely dictate the type of business value that can be expected. This is a point that is mentioned also in the article of Davenport and Ronanki (2018) but is largely overlook in empirical studies. Providing exact definitions on what type of AI application is studied is critical for business value research. In addition, it is important that studies define the exact use and application of the technology since this has an important bearing on how business value is realised. This point also relates heavily to the choice of theory used to support business value generation, as well as the context in which these technologies are deployed.Adding to the above, the different applications of AI largely dictate the type of business value that can be expected.

        <p>Specifically, on the use of theories in studying business value, much of the work that has been published to date remains untheoretical. This poses a major issue as the boundary conditions and context in which AI applications are studied are not grounded on established theoretical frameworks. It also makes the comparison between findings and the identification of complementarities much more difficult. Adding to the above, major themes that have been under-reached remain difficult to identify with an absence of theoretically grounded work. For instance, there is limited work on the diffusion and assimilation of AI application in organisations following longitudinal studies. This creates a large gap in our understanding of how AI applications are gradually assimilated in operations and how business value may evolve depending on the different stages of maturity.Specifically, on the use of theories in studying business value, much of the work that has been published to date remains untheoretical.

        <p>Our findings, apart from their research relevance also raise some important practical implications. Specifically, our analysis documents the types of AI applications that are most pursued by organisations and therefore of highest interest to researchers. The specific applications and technologies of AI that are mostly researched provide practitioners some indication about the future deployments and common technologies in organisations. The fact that machine learning applications are the most researched technology within the AI domain provides some indication about where future investments should be directed, as well as the expected type of business value that they can deliver. Having such insight can allow IT managers to start experimenting with such techniques within their organisations and making appropriate investments to gradually deploy such solutions in business areas where they could be of high value.Our findings, apart from their research relevance also raise some important practical implications.

        <p>In addition, the review of studies points out to those that can enable practitioners to obtain important lessons learned from deployments of AI technologies, identify ways in which methods have been applied and what common challenges emerge, as well as identify those that present general advice and best practices. The broad and extensive literature on AI in organisational settings make it challenging for many practitioners to identify empirical studies that are of value to them. With the synthesis of findings and the presentation of studies based on a thematic categorisation, practitioners are more easily able to identify those studies that contribute to the challenges they and their organisations face when it comes to AI deployments.In addition, the review of studies points out to those that can enable practitioners to obtain important lessons learned from deployments of AI technologies, identify ways in which methods have been applied and what common challenges emerge, as well as identify those that present general advice and best practices.

        <p>In section 2.2, we noted other SLRs conducted in IS concerning artificial intelligence. Rzpeka and Berger (2018) consolidated research streams within IS research that had previously been treated separated and aggregated insights regarding the interaction with different AI-enabled system types. Hofmann et al. (2019) found that nearly every step in the radiology value chain could be improved with the use of machine learning. Borges et al. (2021) found that the strategic use of AI had not been well explored yet and created a preliminary conceptual framework to aid managers in exploring that. Karger (2020) was a first attempt to investigate how block chain and AI could combine. This study took a step back from any specific industry domain to research how AI and machine learning was being defined and used in a broader level, uses a framework adapted from Shaw (2003) and Paternoster et al. (2014) to see the contributions to literature from AI studies in IS and creates a research agenda for future research.In section 2.2, we noted other SLRs conducted in IS concerning artificial intelligence.

        <p>In the following section, we critically evaluate the literature related to our research questions and highlight potential gaps for further study to identify the opportunities for future AI research and thus fulfil the fourth and final aim of this paper. We develop an agenda of future research that build from the identified gaps. This research agenda is presented in Table 14 and was primarily formatted to correspond to the framework provided by Dejoux and Léon (2018) that has been used throughout this study, with the addition of two key areas that warrant further research.In the following section, we critically evaluate the literature related to our research questions and highlight potential gaps for further study to identify the opportunities for future AI research and thus fulfil the fourth and final aim of this paper.

        <p>AI is seeing a small consolidation in how it is defined; as something that exhibits human intelligence, which can be seen in the definitions used by the papers in section 4.1. But the subject and definition of human intelligence is something that is still heavily debated even now. It has been noted that AI technology has tended to "become a somewhat broad church where many forms of automation and limited intelligent machines are labelled as AI" (Dwivedi et al., 2021). There is a gap there for researchers to give more clarity in defining AI, even if that means redefining it away from traditional human intelligence. Section 4.2.1 also points to a resurgence in interest in AI in recent years, though many of the studies here are heavily focused on the technology and performance aspect of AI. More research should be done on the societal and personal effects these recent advances will have on people, both in the workplace and their everyday lives.AI is seeing a small consolidation in how it is defined; as something that exhibits human intelligence, which can be seen in the definitions used by the papers in section 4.1.

        <p>Researchers are increasingly using machine learning as a major component of their methodology when researching various topics, but currently there is a gap where much of this research could further expand on how and why they are using machine learning the way they are. For expert systems, there seems to be a shift away from the "traditional" style of ES with just a few experts managing a system to a more hybrid knowledge base that uses a variety of AI systems (Wagner, 2017). This increased complexity may also mean it will take more time and effort than usual to see a return on the time and resources invested.Researchers are increasingly using machine learning as a major component of their methodology when researching various topics, but currently there is a gap where much of this research could further expand on how and why they are using machine learning the way they are.

        <p>Research into the full aspects of how service robots could potentially affect business and people is still lacking. Wider debate is needed into the interactive and psychological elements of robot-human interaction, especially in the long term, with some studies specifically showing that the strategic use of AI technologies for customer and employee engagement has not been well exploited yet (Borges et al., 2021;Gursoy, Chi, Lu, &amp; Nunkoo, 2019). A specific domain that is currently lacking in research for robotics is technophobia; previous research has examined the fear of computers and have not accounted for new and evolving technologies such as robots (Sinha, Singh, Gupta, &amp; Singh, 2020). Research into extensive interactions between advanced chatbots and humans is still immature, so researchers should take advantage of the increase in NLP capability and the usage of its technologies to do further research. Finally, machine vision doesn't seem to be taking advantage of some of the recent technological advances seen in the new studies in machine learning, so there's a gap there for researchers to see if and how machine learning could be improved. Additionally, much of IS literature recognises that IS alone is ineffective in generating value, so complementary assets are key to realising value from IS (Shea, Dow, &amp; Chong, 2019). AI is one of these complementary assets with potential for transformative value in IS (Nishant, Kennedy, &amp; Corbertt, 2020).Research into the full aspects of how service robots could potentially affect business and people is still lacking.

        <p>There is potential for AI in all its forms. Despite the interest in AI in recent years, there remains gaps in knowledge. However, AI does tend to encompass a broad array of ideas and practises, ranging from the specifics of the technology used to even how it is defined. Many forms of automation, machine learning and intelligent agents are thus labelled as AI. However, despite the great strides in AI noted in the, so called "strong" AI doesn't seem like it will be made a reality within the foreseeable future (Kurzweil, 2005). The future agenda of AI seems set on the further advancement of "weak" AI where specific tasks and decisions are attributed to machines, especially as much of the current research is focused on industry specific uses of AI i.e., AI in healthcare, AI in manufacturing etc. This leaves a gap for researchers to consider the use of AI in other domains, such as agriculture sustainability (Nishant, Kennedy, &amp; Corbertt, 2020) and the public sector (Dennehy, 2020;Abubakar, Behravesh, Rezapouraghda, &amp; Yildiz, 2019).There is potential for AI in all its forms.

        <p>From the findings and analysis of this SLR, it highlights a need for a more coherent working definition of AI among academia. To improve the coherence and efficiency of research and communication, it is better to make our working definitions explicit.From the findings and analysis of this SLR, it highlights a need for a more coherent working definition of AI among academia.

        <p>This systematic literature review study provides a structured understanding of the state-of-the-art of AI research in IS.

        <p>A clear finding emerging from this systematic literature review is the need to (i) increase the number of rigorous academic studies on AI, especially regarding tools and models, (ii) be more detailed on the definition of AI used in studies, even when it is not the focus, and (iii) build on cumulative knowledge. Research on AI in IS is still largely unexplored. While there is a relatively sizable amount of literature concerning AI in some way, a comprehensive review of what is known about AI in IS is lacking. This is especially true for the way AI is defined in IS, which is still disparate. This study examines the body of knowledge about AI in IS. This work has developed one of the very few SLRs on AI in IS and has provided a structured analysis of trends and gaps in the field.A clear finding emerging from this systematic literature review is the need to (i) increase the number of rigorous academic studies on AI, especially regarding tools and models, (ii) be more detailed on the definition of AI used in studies, even when it is not the focus, and (iii) build on cumulative knowledge.

        <p>The study provides new insights to the field of IS through the utilisation of conceptions of AI definition, mapping activities to AI, and value relating to AI. We identified gaps in knowledge in the context of AI research and IS, which provides a starting point for IS researchers and IS practitioners to advance the socio-technical knowledge surrounding AI. Thus, we make a call for future IS studies to examine AI, specifically to how AI is defined in contemporary IS research. • Increase in use of machine learning as a methodology among researchers.The study provides new insights to the field of IS through the utilisation of conceptions of AI definition, mapping activities to AI, and value relating to AI.
