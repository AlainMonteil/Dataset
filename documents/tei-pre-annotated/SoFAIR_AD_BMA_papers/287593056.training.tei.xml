        <p>Opportunity exploitation is a key aspect of the corporate entrepreneurship process and is particularly important to maintain a family firm through multiple generations. Drawing on an organizational design perspective, we investigate opportunity exploitation in family versus nonfamily firms. The empirical analyses on survey data from a sample of 224 Italian firms reveal that family firms exploit significantly fewer opportunities than nonfamily firms, and this result is fully mediated by the organization of their TMT. Our findings show that how family firms organize is crucial for opportunity exploitation, thus extending and enriching prior corporate entrepreneurship research, highlighting the importance of bringing an organizational design perspective to corporate entrepreneurship and family business studies.Opportunity exploitation is a key aspect of the corporate entrepreneurship process and is particularly important to maintain a family firm through multiple generations.

        <p>Corporate entrepreneurship is the process through which firms innovate, set up new businesses, and transform themselves (Guth and Ginsberg, 1990;Sharma and Chrisman, 1999;Teng, 2007;Zahra, 1991Zahra, , 1993;;Zahra et al., 1999) by actively creating and exploiting opportunities (Ireland et al., 2009;Teng, 2007). Product innovation, process innovation, and entering new businesses are just some examples of corporate entrepreneurship (Covin and Slevin, 1991;Miller, 1983;Zahra et al., 2000). Through corporate entrepreneurship, firms can positively affect their survival, growth, wealth, and competitive advantage (Bhardwaj et al., 2006;Bojica and Fuentes, 2012;Dess et al., 2003;Zahra, 1991Zahra, , 1993)). It is therefore seen as vital to the long-term prosperity of family firms (Kellermanns and Eddleston, 2006;Uhlaner et al., 2012).Corporate entrepreneurship is the process through which firms innovate, set up new businesses, and transform themselves (Guth and Ginsberg, 1990;Sharma and Chrisman, 1999;Teng, 2007;Zahra, 1991Zahra, , 1993;;Zahra et al., 1999) by actively creating and exploiting opportunities (Ireland et al., 2009;Teng, 2007).

        <p>The importance of corporate entrepreneurship to family firms' prosperity has spurred research investigating differences between family and nonfamily firms (e.g., Duran et al., 2016;Kellermanns and Hoy, 2017;Zahra et al., 2004), as well as differences among family firms (Eddleston et al., 2012;Kellermanns and Eddleston, 2006;Minola et al., 2016). However, the findings are mixed (i.e., Kellermanns and Eddleston, 2006;Naldi et al., 2007;Patel and Fiet, 2011;Ratten et al., 2017;Sciascia et al., 2012;Zahra et al., 2004;Zellweger and Sieger, 2012), which may be due to the field's predominant focus on opportunity recognition (also labelled opportunity formation, and creation), which is just one side of the corporate entrepreneurship coin (Barney et al., 2018;Foss et al., 2013). Indeed, there is a difference between recognizing an opportunity and taking action to exploit that opportunity (McMullen &amp; Shepherd, 2006).The importance of corporate entrepreneurship to family firms' prosperity has spurred research investigating differences between family and nonfamily firms (e.g., Duran et al., 2016;Kellermanns and Hoy, 2017;Zahra et al., 2004), as well as differences among family firms (Eddleston et al., 2012;Kellermanns and Eddleston, 2006;Minola et al., 2016).

        <p>Opportunity exploitation refers to the deployment of actions, resources, and investments to exploit opportunities that have previously been formed (Cha and Bae, 2010;Eckardt and Shane, 2003;Foss and Klein, 2012;Foss et al., 2013;Shane and Venkataraman, 2000). Thus, opportunity formation 1 and opportunity exploitation are two key aspects of corporate entrepreneurship (Barney et al., 2018). For example, once a firm has recognized an opportunity to develop a new product (i.e., opportunity formation), it must then decide whether to take action to exploit that opportunity, which often includes identifying resources and investments, and making decisions related to production, marketing, and sales. To date, the scarce articles that focus on family firms' opportunity exploitation are largely conceptual (e.g., Goel &amp; Jones, 2016;Sharma and Salvato, 2011). We therefore lack understanding of what drives opportunity exploitation in the context of family firms, despite recent organizational design research stressing the importance of capturing a firm's ability to realize entrepreneurial opportunities (Foss et al., 2013(Foss et al., , 2015)).Opportunity exploitation refers to the deployment of actions, resources, and investments to exploit opportunities that have previously been formed (Cha and Bae, 2010;Eckardt and Shane, 2003;Foss and Klein, 2012;Foss et al., 2013;Shane and Venkataraman, 2000).

        <p>This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved Organizational design is expected to be related to a firm's exploitation of opportunities because it reflects how an organization and its top management team (TMT) are structured to realize its goals, and how different structures are particularly suitable for the performance of certain activities (Nadler &amp; Tushman, 1997;Russo &amp; Harrison, 2005). Specifically, organizational design is defined as the roles, processes, and structures created by an organization to establish accountability and responsibility, and to develop and implement its strategies (Greenwood &amp; Miller, 2010;Miller &amp; Friesen, 1984). As such, it is seen as the architecture of an organization that calls for a configurational approach that considers the holistic, interdependences of a firm's structural elements rather than simply studying each element in isolation (e.g. Ennen &amp; Richter, 2010;Foss et al., 2013;Greenwood &amp; Miller, 2010). The underlying principle of organizational design is that it is only possible to understand the actual effect of the whole organization (i.e., the joint effect of the design of its organizational elements) on firm behavior by simultaneously considering the interdependent elements (Ennen and Richter, 2010;Thompson, 1967). Key organizational design elements expected to affect a firm's opportunity exploitation are: delegation, incentives, coordination, communication, formalization, and organization size (Foss et al., 2013(Foss et al., , 2015)). Thus, although contingency theory recognizes that there is no 'one best way to organize' (e.g., Galbraith, 1973;Mintzberg, 1979;Shetty and Carlisle, 1972), some organizational designs may be more conducive to opportunity exploitation than others.This article is protected by copyright.

        <p>Accordingly, organizational design may help to elucidate family firms' entrepreneurial behavior. For example, in comparison to nonfamily firms, family firms tend to be more centralized and CEO-centric (Carney, 2005;Feltham et al., 2005;Martin et al., 2016), with less incentive compensation (De Massis et al., 2016;Neckebrouck et al., 2018), and less formalization (Stewart and Hitt, 2012;Zhang and Ma, 2008). Research has long recognized that family ownership is associated with unique governance practices (Carney, 2005;König et al., 2013;Lubatkin et al., 2007;Schulze and Gedajlovic, 2010) and the desire for strong control over decision-making that can limit the top management team's participation (Gomez-Mejia et al., 2001, 2007;Kammerlander and Ganter, 2015;Schulze, 2016). Thus, if family firms tend to have a different organizational design than nonfamily firms, this may explain why they are less entrepreneurial. Further, differences in organizational design among family firms may explain why some family firms exploit more opportunities than others.Accordingly, organizational design may help to elucidate family firms' entrepreneurial behavior.

Accordingly, we extend organizational design principles (e.g., Galbraith, 1974;Hambrick and Mason, 1984) to the study of corporate entrepreneurship by exploring whether family firms' propensity to design a more centralized organizational structure explains why their opportunity exploitation differs from that of nonfamily firms. In so doing, and consistent with the principles of organizational design, we follow the suggestions of previous studies (Ennen and Richter, 2010;Foss et al., 2013;Jansen et al., 2005) and adopt a configurational approach, which allows us to capture the interplay and complementarities among different organizational design elements rather than study single elements in isolation (Jensen, 1998;Thompson, 1967).

        <p>We build on Ireland et al.'s (2009) idea of a "pro-entrepreneurial organizational architecture" and propose that a participative TMT configuration (i.e., a TMT where organizational elements are designed so that all members participate in decision-making in a coordinated way) promotes opportunity exploitation, while a more CEO-centric TMT configuration hinders it. While we theorize the existence of two TMT configurations, the cluster analysis of the six organizational design elements (i.e., delegation, incentives, coordination, communication, formalization, and organization size) unexpectedly revealed the presence of three TMT configurations 2 : the CEOcentric TMT organizational configuration, and two participative organizational configurations that we label integrated TMT and incentive-based TMT, which differ in the mechanisms used to align TMT members' objectives with those of the CEO (i.e., coordination and communication mechanisms in the integrated TMT configuration, and incentives in the incentive-based TMT configuration).We build on Ireland et al.'s (2009) idea of a "pro-entrepreneurial organizational architecture" and propose that a participative TMT configuration (i.e., a TMT where organizational elements are designed so that all members participate in decision-making in a coordinated way) promotes opportunity exploitation, while a more CEO-centric TMT configuration hinders it.

        <p>Corporate entrepreneurship refers to activities designed to revitalize and rejuvenate the business through the formation and exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities (Ireland et al., 2009), and has been linked to firm distinctiveness, growth, and profitability (Eddleston et al., 2008;McGrath, 2001;Zahra et al., 2004). Corporate entrepreneurship is realized when a firm actively forms and then exploits opportunities (Carmeli and Halevi, 2009). As such, for a business to accrue the possible benefits of corporate entrepreneurship, it must take action to exploit opportunities that are deemed worthy of pursuit (McMullen and Shepherd, 2006).Corporate entrepreneurship refers to activities designed to revitalize and rejuvenate the business through the formation and exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities (Ireland et al., 2009), and has been linked to firm distinctiveness, growth, and profitability (Eddleston et al., 2008;McGrath, 2001;Zahra et al., 2004).

        <p>Consistent with this view, recent research has highlighted that opportunity formation is just one aspect of corporate entrepreneurship (Barney et al., 2018), and previously formed opportunities are not necessarily exploited since this requires decision-making, taking risks, and dedicating resources (Choi and Shepherd, 2004;Foss et al., 2015). Research on corporate entrepreneurship acknowledges the importance of opportunity exploitation in increasing a firm's innovation capacity and performance (Bojica and Fuentes, 2012;Rauch et al., 2009). The ability to exploit opportunities may be particularly important to sustain the performance of family firms, since they are often mired in tradition, resistant to change, and anchored to the status quo (e.g., Kellermanns and Eddleston, 2006;Strebel, 1996;Sydow et al., 2009).

        <p>Family business research has traditionally explored the distinctive behavior of family firms vis-àvis their nonfamily counterparts (e.g., Kellermanns and Hoy, 2017). However, regarding corporate entrepreneurship the findings have been mixed. While some studies comparing family and nonfamily firms' corporate entrepreneurship show that family firms have an advantage, others show that they have a disadvantage (i.e., Kellermanns and Eddleston, 2006;Naldi et al., 2007;Patel and Fiet, 2011;Ratten et al., 2017;Sciascia et al., 2012;Zahra et al., 2004;Zellweger and Sieger, 2012). For example, although some research demonstrates that family firms have an advantage over nonfamily firms in recognizing opportunities (Patel and Fiet, 2011), other research contends that family firms are more conservative, and therefore, display less corporate entrepreneurship (Morris, 1998). However, in acknowledging the tendency for research to compare family and nonfamily firms' recognition and exploration of opportunities, Sharma and Salvato (2011) called for studies to focus on opportunity exploitation. They further stressed the need for studies to investigate why family firms differ in their ability to exploit opportunities given mixed findings in the literature regarding their corporate entrepreneurship. Accordingly, there is a need to better understand differences in family and nonfamily firm opportunity exploitation since this is an essential element of corporate entrepreneurship (e.g., Choi and Shepherd, 2004;Ireland et al., 2009;Shane, 2001;Teng, 2007) that is not yet well understood (Goel &amp; Jones, 2016;Sharma &amp; Salvato, 2011).Family business research has traditionally explored the distinctive behavior of family firms vis-àvis their nonfamily counterparts (e.g., Kellermanns and Hoy, 2017).

        <p>Opportunity exploitation requires the willingness to take action to pursue an opportunity (Foss et al., 2015). As such, it commonly implies taking risks by committing resources to projects whose results are unknown (Bojica and Fuentes, 2012;Covin and Slevin, 1991;Miller, 1983).

        <p>Family firms are often disinclined to change because the family has a strong emotional attachment to the firm's original business model and strategies (Kellermanns and Eddleston, 2006;Zahra, 2005). That is, family firms often feel pressure to stay true to their legacy and founding conditions whereas nonfamily firms experience greater freedom to make wholesale changes to their business model and exploit new opportunities (Goel &amp; Jones, 2016). Scholars also suggest that family firms may exploit less opportunities because they do not want to jeopardize the family's wealth, thus causing them to invest less in entrepreneurial endeavors than nonfamily firms (Goel &amp; Jones, 2016;Naldi et al., 2007). Our baseline hypothesis is thus:Family firms are often disinclined to change because the family has a strong emotional attachment to the firm's original business model and strategies (Kellermanns and Eddleston, 2006;Zahra, 2005).

        <p>Organizational design captures the structure and coordination of a firm, and thus includes elements associated with delegation, incentives, coordination, communication, formalization, and organization size (Burton and Obel, 1998;Foss et al., 2015). Accordingly, organizational design research typically focuses on the structural configuration of firm governance and leadership, particularly as they relate to the TMT (e.g., Daspit et al., 2018;Ma and Seidl, 2018), since firms are generally considered to be a reflection of their TMT (Cyert and March, 1963;Hambrick and Mason, 1984). To the best of our knowledge, an organizational design perspective has not yet been applied to family firms despite the fact that research has long recognized their unique governance practices stemming from family control which also reflect common organizational design elements such as formalization (Lansberg, 1983;Lubatkin et al., 2005;Stewart and Hitt, 2012), communication (Kellermanns and Eddleston, 2007), and compensation/incentives (Alessandri et al., 2018;Gomez-Mejia et al., 2003). Thus, family firms' unique organizational design, as reflected by their TMT organizational configuration, may explain why, on average, they are less entrepreneurial than nonfamily firms. Indeed, Ireland et al. (2009) suggested that firms that fail to develop an organizational architecture characterized by a participative structure and aligned incentives will struggle to realize entrepreneurial opportunities. We therefore propose that the distinct TMT configuration of family and nonfamily firms explains why family firms exploit fewer opportunities than nonfamily firms.Organizational design captures the structure and coordination of a firm, and thus includes elements associated with delegation, incentives, coordination, communication, formalization, and organization size (Burton and Obel, 1998;Foss et al., 2015).

        <p>In general, the TMT configuration depends on the managerial style and behavior of the CEO who leads the TMT (Lewin and Stephens, 1994;Mintzberg and Waters, 1985). For example, the CEO is directly responsible for selecting, rewarding, and organizing the TMT, as well as deciding how much decision-making authority to delegate to them (Ling et al., 2008). Whether a CEO decides to make decisions more autonomously or to decentralize decision-making by involving the TMT is a key factor that appears to link organizational design elements (Burton and Obel, 1998;Dessein, 2002;Foss et al., 2013;Ling et al., 2008). For instance, greater decentralization is often associated with higher levels of coordination and communication to ensure that the TMT is guided by the objectives of the CEO and the firm (Dessein, 2002). As decentralization increases, it is also likely that incentives and formalization mechanisms are put in place to foster the TMT's commitment and help shape their decision-making (Alonso et al., 2008;Dessein, 2002;Mintzberg, 1979). A larger TMT is also associated with greater decentralization, since delegating decisionmaking authority to the TMT reduces the CEO's information overload (Colombo and Delmastro, 2008).

Thus, following research that portrays centralization/decentralization as one of the most basic organizational design concepts (Fredrickson, 1986;Love et al., 2002;Mintzberg, 1979) associated with several organizational design elements (Burton and Obel, 1998;Dessein, 2002;Ling et al., 2008), we use it as an umbrella concept to capture TMT configuration. We thus expect that a CEO may organize the TMT to be more CEO-centric or more decentralized and participative. A CEOcentric TMT is one where the CEO controls decisions, and therefore the organization does not require a great deal of coordination, communication exchange, or formalization. In contrast, a participative TMT is characterized by shared control and decentralized decision-making, as well as high coordination and open communication (Davis et al., 1997;Ling et al., 2008).This article is protected by copyright.

        <p>Regarding the TMT configuration of family vs. nonfamily firms, research suggests that family firms centralize more decision-making authority (Feltham et al., 2005;Martin et al., 2016), and tend to manage their firms in a less formalized way than nonfamily firms (e.g., Stewart and Hitt, 2012). Family ownership encourages the family to exercise dominance over the business, which is reflected by their choice of CEO, who is most often a family member (Chen et al., 2010). In turn, when the CEO is a family member or hand-selected by the family, the direction of the firm is expected to be led by the CEO (Carney, 2005;Schulze et al., 2001). Additionally, in comparison to nonfamily firms, family firms are typically governed more by informal mechanisms that depend on strong personal relationships (Daily and Dalton, 1992), and rely less on formal, written procedures (De Massis et al., 2015).Regarding the TMT configuration of family vs. nonfamily firms, research suggests that family firms centralize more decision-making authority (Feltham et al., 2005;Martin et al., 2016), and tend to manage their firms in a less formalized way than nonfamily firms (e.g., Stewart and Hitt, 2012).

        <p>Given family firms' proclivity to entrust the majority of decision-making authority to their CEO, they are likely to feel little need for formal coordination, formalized practices, or open communication, particularly since these practices may limit the CEO's discretion (Le Breton-Miller and Miller, 2006;Schulze et al., 2001). Research suggests that family firm CEOs prefer to exercise complete authority, dictate strategy, and choose the developmental path of their firms with little participation from others (Schulze et al., 2003a). Further, studies suggest that performance incentives, bonuses, and compensation are likely to be lower in family firms than nonfamily firms, since the family governs more through shared values than formal control (Bandiera et al., 2015;Dyer and Whetten, 2006). That is, because their managers' interests are typically aligned with those of the family firm, additional compensation is often not required to synchronize managerial and ownership interests (Neckebrouck et al., 2018).

        <p>The TMT is responsible for making strategic decisions (Amason, 1996;Collins and Clark, 2003) and deciding what resources to put in place to pursue strategic opportunities (Foss et al., 2015;Ling et al., 2008). As such, the TMT is key in transforming entrepreneurial ideas into actions (Damanpour, 1991;Stevenson and Jarillo, 1990). Although organizational design elements have typically been studied individually, those associated with a more participative TMT configuration appear to be most conducive to encouraging opportunity exploitation. For example, Ling et al. (2008) suggest that shared decision-making, information, and effort among the TMT members increase the firm's commitment to new entrepreneurial initiatives. Further, Foss et al. (2015) show that opportunity realization is highest when both decentralization and formalization are at their highest. The authors explain that while decentralization gives managers the discretion to transform opportunities into action, formalization streamlines the work processes and provides a roadmap of tasks that help the firm successfully realize a new opportunity. Moreover, the combination of high decentralization and managers' coordination facilitates opportunity exploitation (Foss et al., 2013).The TMT is responsible for making strategic decisions (Amason, 1996;Collins and Clark, 2003) and deciding what resources to put in place to pursue strategic opportunities (Foss et al., 2015;Ling et al., 2008).

        <p>Taken together, we posit that the TMT configuration will mediate the relationship between family firm status and opportunity exploitation. The organizational design literature suggests that the organization of the TMT reflects the underlying organizational structure of the firm (e.g., Beckman and Burton, 2011;Chandler, 1962;Guadalupe et al., 2014). Research also demonstrates a significant relationship between TMT characteristics and firm performance (e.g., Hambrick et al., 1996;Minichilli et al., 2010;Simsek et al., 2005). Accordingly, it appears that firms need to have the appropriate organizational design of their TMT to pursue opportunities (Foss et al., 2013(Foss et al., , 2015;;Ireland et al., 2009;Ling et al., 2008). Put differently, the type of organizational configuration adopted by the TMT may determine the firm's ability to make decisions and implement actions to exploit opportunities. We thus argue that family firms exploit fewer opportunities than nonfamily firms due to their propensity to adopt a CEO-centric TMT configuration. This type of configuration limits the involvement of TMT members, thereby lessening the firm's opportunity exploitation. Conversely, nonfamily firms are expected to experience greater opportunity exploitation than family firms due to their propensity to adopt a participative TMT configuration. Accordingly, we argue that the TMT configuration is the mechanism through which differences in family and nonfamily firms' opportunity exploitation are explained. We synthetize our hypotheses in Figure 1 below.Taken together, we posit that the TMT configuration will mediate the relationship between family firm status and opportunity exploitation.

In terms of the three dimensions used to stratify the sample (i.e., size, industry, and geographic location), the chisquared tests showed the sample is representative of the population. 4 The tests also indicated no particular issues with non-response bias: we compared (i) respondents vs. non-respondents, (ii) early vs. late respondents, and (iii) full vs. dropped respondents (i.e., those who only partially answered the survey). For respondents vs. non-respondents, we considered the same dimensions above and found differences only for geographic location. Early vs. late respondents, and full vs. dropped respondents were then compared considering the three dimensions used to stratify the sample and two CEO characteristics (gender and age). In these cases, we found differences only for the geographic location of early and late respondents (i.e., CEOs closer to the university that administered the survey responded faster). Finally, the reliability of CEOs' answers was confirmed by crosschecking them with secondary sources of information where possible, and administering a second questionnaire to their Chief Human Resource Officer (CHRO).

Due to missing data, the sample used to test the hypotheses consists of 224 Italian firms, 116 of which (51.79%) are family firms. Family firm status was determined by self-identification as a family firm and family ownership, as explained below. The post hoc power analysis suggested that the power levels were acceptable (e.g., Cohen, 1988;Mazen et al., 1987a, b) for both the full sample (statistical power = 0.9962) and the subsample of only family firms (statistical power = 0.9385).General firm characteristics and balance-sheet data were collected from secondary data sources (i.e., the AIDA database).

While they are both characterized by the highest level of delegation, they differ in the mechanisms used to align managers' goals with those of the firm.

Based on these analyses, we can thus conclude that common method bias is not a concern in our study.</p>

        <p>Model 1 shows that family firms exploit fewer opportunities than nonfamily firms, supporting our baseline Hypothesis 1. The coefficient of Family firm is indeed negative and significant (pvalue = 0.058). Model 2 tests the effect of family firm status on TMT configuration, and shows that Family firm is positive and significant (p-value = 0.014), confirming Hypothesis 2. Specifically, the likelihood of adopting a CEO-centric TMT configuration (rather than participative TMT configurations) is 0.169 percentage points greater for family firms than for nonfamily firm. In Model 3, we test the effect of TMT configuration on opportunity exploitation.Model 1 shows that family firms exploit fewer opportunities than nonfamily firms, supporting our baseline Hypothesis 1.

        <p>Model 4 tests the mediating effect of the CEO-centric TMT configuration on the relationship between family firm status and opportunity exploitation (Hypothesis 4). While the coefficient of CEO-centric TMT is negative and significant (p-value = 0.000), Family firm loses its significance (p-value = 0.213). This result indicates the presence of full mediation and is confirmed by both the absence of a moderating effect and by more contemporary approaches to test mediation. That is, Model 5 demonstrates that Family firm does not significantly moderate the negative relation between CEO-centric TMT and Opportunity exploitation, which thereby provides further support for the mediating effect. Further, following Hicks and Tingley (2011) and Sobel (1982), the average causal mediation effect is negative (coef. = -0.087) and significant, as well as the indirect effect (p-value = 0.035) and the total effect (p-value = 0.063), while the direct effect of Family firm is not significant (p-value = 0.233); the percentage of the total effect that is mediated by CEO-centric TMT is equal to 0.378. The Sobel and the Goodman tests are also significant (p-value = 0.035 and 0.031). Coherent results also emerge using the modern bootstrapping approach (Bollen and Stine, 1990;Shrout and Bolger, 2002) whereby the indirect effect is negative and significant (p-value = 0.046), while the direct effect is not significant (p-value = 0.226). Finally, the mediating effect is also confirmed by the most recent approach of Emsley and Liu (2013), which resulted in a natural direct effect of Family firm as negative and not significant (coef. = -0.179, p-value = 0.233), while the natural indirect effect (coef. = -0.109, p-value = 0.035) and the total effect (coef. = -0.288, p-value = 0.063) are negative and statistically significant.

        <p>We conducted additional analyses to test the robustness of the results. First, we checked whether family firms that do not adopt the CEO-centric TMT configuration are similar to nonfamily firms in terms of opportunity exploitation. We thus ran Model 1 excluding family firms that adopt this configuration. Results showed that being a Family firm is no longer significantly related to opportunity exploitation (p-value = 0.647). We can thus further corroborate that family firms adopting a participative TMT configuration appear to exploit as many opportunities as nonfamily firms.We conducted additional analyses to test the robustness of the results.

        <p>Fourth, we performed a robustness check concerning the computation of the multi-item constructs we used to measure some of the six organizational design elements considered to identify the TMT organizational configuration: formal coordination, tacit coordination, and ongoing communication. As mentioned in Table I, to compute these variables, we applied Principal Component Analyses (PCA) to the corresponding items. While it is generally preferred as a data reduction method (Muca et al., 2013), one may argue that as PCA imposes orthogonality, it might not be appropriate. Therefore, we computed these three variables by using the maximum likelihood method, and then reran all the subsequent analyses. 8 The results are in line with those presented above and are available upon request.Fourth, we performed a robustness check concerning the computation of the multi-item constructs we used to measure some of the six organizational design elements considered to identify the TMT organizational configuration: formal coordination, tacit coordination, and ongoing communication.

        <p>While we originally followed the family essence and family involvement criteria to identify family firms, as recommended in the family business literature (see e.g., Chrisman et al., 2012), the TMT configuration may depend on whether a family firm is family owned and managed or is only family owned. Following this approach, we identified 87 firms that are family owned and managed and 29 firms that are only family owned. Adopting a more restrictive definition, we thus ran our estimates considering only family firms that are both family owned and managed.While we originally followed the family essence and family involvement criteria to identify family firms, as recommended in the family business literature (see e.g., Chrisman et al., 2012), the TMT configuration may depend on whether a family firm is family owned and managed or is only family owned.

        <p>We have investigated opportunity exploitation in family firms, applying an organizational design perspective. The data reveal that family firms exploit fewer opportunities than their nonfamily counterparts. However, they can overcome this negative difference by organizing their TMT in a participative way, as nonfamily firms tend to do. Results showed that the adoption of a more CEO-centric TMT configuration mediates the negative relationship between family firm status and opportunity exploitation. As such, family firms tend to organize their TMT substantially differently from nonfamily firms, preferring the CEO-centric TMT configuration to the participative configurations, namely, integrated TMT or incentive-based TMT. Further, our robustness test revealed that family firms' preference for a CEO-centric TMT increases as the percentage of family members on the TMT increases. In turn, the CEO-centric TMT configuration was found to negatively affect opportunity exploitation. It is the adoption of a CEO-centric TMT configuration that therefore explains (i.e., fully mediates) the negative relationship between family firms and opportunity exploitation. As such, our study suggests that it is the distinctive choices that family firms tend to make in organizational design that explain differences in family and nonfamily firms' opportunity exploitation, and not the firm's family status per se.We have investigated opportunity exploitation in family firms, applying an organizational design perspective.

        <p>Our paper advances the literature in numerous directions. First, we add to the debate on corporate entrepreneurship in family firms by studying the exploitation of previously formed opportunities, which remained under-investigated in relation to family firms (Kellermanns and Eddleston, 2006;Kraus et al., 2012;McKelvie et al., 2014).

All rights reserved research largely overlooks the role of organizational design in controlling and coordinating the activities necessary to achieve a family firm's goals, assuming that once an opportunity is identified, successful opportunity exploitation will follow (Chrisman et al., 2016). This may, however, not always be the case. Our study shows that how a family firm organizes its TMT has a profound effect on its ability to exploit opportunities. Thus, the extent to which a family firm is able to exploit opportunities depends on the family firm's capacity to organize, i.e., to choose an appropriate TMT configuration. From a contingency theory perspective (e.g., Galbraith, 1973;Mintzberg, 1979;Shetty and Carlisle, 1972), our results therefore suggest that a TMT's configuration is often contingent on a firm's family status; however, the results also suggest that an integrated or incentive-based TMT configuration appear 'best' in fostering opportunity exploitation.This article is protected by copyright.

        <p>Organizational design therefore offers an important piece of the puzzle in understanding family firms' opportunity exploitation since it allowed us to discover how family and nonfamily firms tend to organize their TMTs in distinct ways and, in turn, how the TMT's configuration influences a firm's opportunity exploitation. As such, our findings should encourage family business scholars to move beyond their primary focus on family ownership and management (Revilla et al., 2016;Sciascia &amp; Mazzola, 2008) to also consider the organization's design and specifically, the TMT's configuration. We therefore hope to see additional research that places the principles of organizational design at the center of family business theory and research. Further, because our study demonstrates that it is not family status per se that explains family firms' lower opportunity exploitation, but rather, their choices in organizational design, we call on family business scholars to further leverage mainstream management theories to explore how the business-owning family influences key choices of their firm. Although family business scholars often express a need to develop theories specific to family firms, our study suggests that mainstream management theories can be usefully applied to the study of family firms. Further, with their extension to the family firm context, such research could contribute to the wider management literature by demonstrating how family ownership alters the assumptions and predictions of mainstream management theories.Organizational design therefore offers an important piece of the puzzle in understanding family firms' opportunity exploitation since it allowed us to discover how family and nonfamily firms tend to organize their TMTs in distinct ways and, in turn, how the TMT's configuration influences a firm's opportunity exploitation.

        <p>Despite limitations, our findings also have important implications for family firms. They caution family business owners and managers that their firms may be disadvantaged in exploiting opportunities compared to nonfamily firms, and highlight how their TMT organization is at the core of such disadvantage. Family firms should therefore keep in mind that their natural tendency toward centralizing decision-making authority with the CEO and limiting the use of incentives, formalization, communication, and coordination mechanisms, can jeopardize their ability to successfully exploit business opportunities. Thus, if the family firms' TMT configuration is CEOcentric, their opportunity exploitation is likely to suffer. However, by organizing their TMT in a more participative way, they can significantly bolster their ability to exploit opportunities. Indeed, those family firms that adopted an integrated TMT or incentive-based TMT configuration had a similar level of opportunity exploitation as nonfamily firms.

        <p>This study extended organizational design principles to the study of family and nonfamily firms' corporate entrepreneurship by investigating how their TMT's configuration affects their opportunity exploitation. We show that family firms exploit significantly fewer opportunities than nonfamily firms because they tend to adopt a CEO-centric TMT configuration, whereas nonfamily firms adopt an integrated TMT or incentive-based TMT configuration. Thus, it is not being a family firm, per se, that leads to less opportunity exploitation than nonfamily firms, but rather, family firms' strong tendency to adopt a CEO-centric TMT configuration. For those family firms with a more participative TMT configuration (i.e., integrated or incentive-based), there was no significant difference in their opportunity exploitation and that of nonfamily firms.
