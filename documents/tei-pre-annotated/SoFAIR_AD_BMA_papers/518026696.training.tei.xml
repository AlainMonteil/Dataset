        <p>The transition towards a Circular Economy (CE) in the built environment is vital to reduce resource consumption, emissions and waste generation. To support the development of circular building components, assessment metrics are needed. Previous work identified Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as an important method to analyse the environmental performance in a CE context. However, questions arise about how to model and calculate circular buildings components. We develop an LCA model for circular building components in four steps. First, we elaborate on the CE principles and LCA standards to identify requirements and gaps. Second, we adapt LCA standards and propose the 'Circular Economy Life Cycle Assessment' (CE-LCA) model. Third, we test the model by assessing an exemplary building component: the Circular Kitchen (CIK). Finally, we evaluate the CE-LCA model with 44 experts. In the CE-LCA model, building components are considered as a composite of parts and materials with different and multiple use cycles; the system boundary is extended to include these cycles, dividing the impacts using a circular allocation approach. The case of the CIK shows that the CE-LCA model supports an ex-ante assessment of circular building components in theoretical context; it makes an important step to support the transition to a circular built environment.The transition towards a Circular Economy (CE) in the built environment is vital to reduce resource consumption, emissions and waste generation.

        <p>The building sector is said to consume 40% of global resources, and to generate 33% of all emissions and 40% of waste globally (Ness and Xing, 2017). The concept of the Circular Economy (CE) -originating from several schools of thought and popularised by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (2013) -proposes an alternative to the linear economy of 'take-make-use and dispose'. The CE aims to enable economic growth without an ever-growing pressure on the environment (Pomponi and Moncaster, 2017). We understand CE as "a regenerative system in which resource input and waste, emission, and energy leakage are minimised by slowing, closing and narrowing material and energy loops." (Geissdoerfer et al., 2017 p. 759) Narrowing loops is reducing resource use (i. e., increasing efficiency); slowing loops means prolonging the use of (building) components, parts and materials by extending lifespans and introducing multiple cycles; closing loops is to (re)cycle materials from End-of-Life (EoL) back to production (Bocken et al., 2016). The cycles in the CE can be divided into biological and technical material cycles (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2013). Value Retention Processes (VRPs) -also called R-imperativesare key in realising the cycles in a CE (Potting et al., 2017;Reike et al., 2018;Wouterszoon Jansen et al., 2020). Examples of VRPs are reduce, repair, re-use, and recycle; we refer to the framework of Wouterszoon Jansen et al. (2020).The building sector is said to consume 40% of global resources, and to generate 33% of all emissions and 40% of waste globally (Ness and Xing, 2017).

        <p>As the building sector has the highest share in resource consumption, emissions and waste generation of all industries (Ness and Xing, 2017), the transition towards a CE in the built environment is vital to create a more sustainable society. The built environment can be made more circular by integrating CE principles in building components. These components can be placed in new buildings and in existing buildings during maintenance and renovation to gradually make the existing stock more circular. To integrate CE principles in building components, integral changes in their designs, supply chains, and business models are needed (Bocken et al., 2016;Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2013;Hart et al., 2019;van Stijn et al., 2020;van Stijn and Gruis, 2020;Wouterszoon Jansen et al., 2020). Yet, there are many possible design alternatives for (more) circular building components (van Stijn and Gruis, 2020). A roof which is constructed with non-virgin materials, or modular, or bio-based and biodegradable could be considered more circular in its own respect. To transition to the 'most' circular built environment, we need to assess which designs result in the most environmentally-circular building components; so, an assessment method is needed.As the building sector has the highest share in resource consumption, emissions and waste generation of all industries (Ness and Xing, 2017), the transition towards a CE in the built environment is vital to create a more sustainable society.

        <p>In previous research, two methods are often identified to support assessment of environmental performance in the CE: in a Material Flow Analysis (MFA), mass balances are calculated over time to identify the state and changes of material flows within a defined system (Corona et al., 2019). MFA can be used to analyse quality of resource flows (e.g., virgin, renewable, recycled) and the resource consumption of building components in a CE (Elia et al., 2017;Pomponi and Moncaster, 2017). Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is the best-defined method to analyse environmental impacts, and can be applied in a CE context (Pomponi and Moncaster, 2017;Scheepens et al., 2016).

        <p>In LCA, the environmental impacts of a building (component) are assessed along (parts of) its life cycle. However, conventional LCA studies focus on analysing the impact of a building for a single service life (cycle) (Eberhardt et al., 2020;Hauschild et al., 2018;Suhariyanto et al., 2017). Whereas in a CE, within the building (component) lifecycle, parts and materialspotentiallyhave different and multiple (use) cycles (Eberhardt et al., 2020;van Stijn et al., 2020;van Stijn and Gruis, 2020;Wouterszoon Jansen et al., 2020).

        <p>Approaches to multiple cycles in LCA are discussed in standards (EN 15804, 2012;EN 15978, 2011;ISO 14040, 2006;ISO 14044, 2006), and have been compared for short-lived, products (e.g., Allacker et al., 2017;van der Harst et al., 2016), for re-use of building components (see De Wolf et al. (2020)) and in a circular built environment context (see Eberhardt et al. (2020)). Allacker et al. (2017) compared 11 allocation approaches. Only the 'Linearly Degressive' (LD) approach included all cycles of the product system within the product assessment. Ultimately, Allacker et al. (2017) preferred to (only) include the previous and subsequent cycle of the product within the assessment as they found predicting all cycles challenging. On the other hand, Eberhardt et al. (2020) suggested the LD approach incentivizes narrowing, slowing and closing cycles both now (i.e., downstream) and in the future (i.e., upstream). They built upon the LD approach, presenting the CE LD approach. De Wolf et al.

        <p>These studies focused on allocation, concluding with recommendations and/or (optimized) allocation formulas. Studies addressing CE adoption in building LCA remain sparse (Hossain and Ng, 2018). Comprehensive and practical guidance to apply LCA in circular building components remains lacking. Doing such an LCA, we touch upon multiple methodological questions: how to set the system boundary and model the system; how to apply an allocation approach which shares impacts between all cycles; how to address system uncertainties? In turn, it influences how to define the object of the assessment, period of assessment, functional unit, stages of assessment, modelling of the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI), calculations of environmental impacts (LCIA), and sensitivity analysis. Consequently, adaptations to LCA standards for building products and buildingssuch as EN 15978 (2011) andEN 15804 (2012) are needed.These studies focused on allocation, concluding with recommendations and/or (optimized) allocation formulas.

        <p>We built upon the aforementioned allocation studies; we depart from the application perspective by exploring how these abovementioned methodological questions can be addressed in multi-cycle LCAsand testing the (dis)advantages. By adapting existing building LCA standards, we aim to propose a model to apply LCA in the development of circular building components.We built upon the aforementioned allocation studies; we depart from the application perspective by exploring how these abovementioned methodological questions can be addressed in multi-cycle LCAsand testing the (dis)advantages.

        <p>An iterative, stepwise approach was used to develop the model (see Fig. 1). In step 1, we elaborated on key principles of CE in building components and analysed how existing LCA standards deal with these; we identified potential gaps in theory and current standards, and defined requirements for LCA of circular building components. In step 2, we built on the existing LCA standards, proposing the CE-LCA model for building components. In step 3, we tested the CE-LCA model by applying it in the assessment of an exemplary circular component: the Circular Kitchen (CIK). In step 4, we evaluated the model with experts. Iterations of refinement, test and evaluation were continued until the model fulfilled the requirements and the evaluation step yielded no new remarks by the experts. This paper is structured following these stepspresenting the final iteration of the CE-LCA model.An iterative, stepwise approach was used to develop the model (see Fig. 1).

        <p>To cycle building components at their highest utility and value, we should consider the building components as a composite of parts and materials, each with their ownoptimisedlifespan. Duffy coined the concept of 'shearing layers', which was later elaborated on by Brand (1994): a building consists of 'layers' with their own lifespan which could be changed independently. Similarly, building components could be regarded as a composite of parts and materials with different lifespans. Per building component more levels (e.g., sub-components, resources) or fewer could be identified.To cycle building components at their highest utility and value, we should consider the building components as a composite of parts and materials, each with their ownoptimisedlifespan.

        <p>To increase the overall lifespan of building components, parts and materials might be exchanged at a different rate (Bocken et al., 2016;Wouterszoon Jansen et al., 2020). Alternatively, parts or materials might have longer lifespans than the building component. Consider a façade with a 30-year lifespan and brick finishing with 75-year lifespan. Commonly bricks are laid using mortar making them hard to separate and re-use after 30 years. If during design the 'layers' were differentiated based on lifespan, alternative finishing materials andequally importantjoining-techniques could have been considered to prevent premature disposal.To increase the overall lifespan of building components, parts and materials might be exchanged at a different rate (Bocken et al., 2016;Wouterszoon Jansen et al., 2020).

        <p>Current European LCA standards focus on building (EN 15978, 2011) and building product (EN 15804, 2012) assessment. An intermediate linkon building component levelis missing (Lützkendorf, 2019). In the EN 15978 (2011), the building is considered as a composite of components, parts and materials with different lifespans. Yet, different levels of the building system are commonly not integrated into a single LCA. How multiple levels are 'connected' can influence the lifespans and cycles of each element in the system; optimising these is a key principle to keep elements cycling at their highest utility and value. Therefore, a multi-level LCA is required in CE-context. For a building component LCA, this means including underlying levels such as parts and materials; as the building component is installed in a building, the cohesion with the building level should be considered.Current European LCA standards focus on building (EN 15978, 2011) and building product (EN 15804, 2012) assessment.

        <p>Understanding the interplay of different types of lifespan is vital to slow and close loops optimally. For example, Geraedts et al.(2009, p. 298) distinguish technical, functional and economic lifespan. The technical lifespan is defined as "the maximum period during which it can physically [perform]" (Cooper (1994, p. 5). The economic lifespan is the period in which the benefits outweigh the costs (Geraedts et al., 2009). The functional lifespan can be influenced by regulations and changing user needs, including the function or appearance of the building component (Geraedts et al., 2009;Méquignon and Ait Haddou, 2014). By analysing the interplay of different lifespansin the entire building component systemthe leading lifespan can be identified. This is 'the weakest' link determining the obsolescenceand replacement rateof (parts of) the system.Understanding the interplay of different types of lifespan is vital to slow and close loops optimally.

        <p>Assumptions on lifespan in LCAs are complex; how they are made varies. When applying LCA, Reference Service Lifespans (RSL) of building types are provided in national standards (e.g., Stichting Bouwkwaliteit (2019, p. 37)). Building product and material RSL may be found in reference lists which could be based on argued assumptions by the producer (Stichting Bouwkwaliteit, 2019, p. 13) or calculated by balancing the technical, functional, aesthetic and economic lifespan (e. g., Aagaard et al. (2013)). For newly-designed circular components, an estimated Service Life (SL) needs to be determined. ISO 15686, 2011 provides the standard for SL planning for buildingsincluding for 'innovative' components. It includes the 'factor method' in which the 'Estimated SL' of the component is calculated by multiplying its RSL by a number of factors that affect the technical lifespan (e.g., 'material quality' or 'work execution level'). However, no functional or economic lifespan factors are included. Previous work concluded that buildings or components are replaced more frequently than assumed (Barras and Clark, 1996;Seo and Hwang, 2001;Slaughter, 2001) indicating that the functional or economic lifespan was shorter than expected. Junnila &amp; Horvath (2003) argue that the influence of obsolescence is insufficiently considered in LCA.

        <p>To slow and close cycles optimally, each element of the building component system might have multiple and different use cycles, requiring different VRPs. These cycles can be 'open-' or 'closed loops': In recycling theory, closed loops refer to recycling for the same quality or use (Huysveld et al., 2019). However, in circular supply chains, closed cycles may refer to VRPs realised by the industry(partners) involved in the original production (French and LaForge, 2006;Genovese et al., 2017). Additionally, VRPs can take place 'inside' the assessed building component, or 'outside'. For example, windows can be refurbished and re-installed in the same façade, or they can be re-installed elsewhere.To slow and close cycles optimally, each element of the building component system might have multiple and different use cycles, requiring different VRPs.

        <p>Guidelines for dealing with multiple cycles (also named 'multifunctionality' or 'secondary functions') can be found in LCA standards (EN 15804, 2012;EN 15978, 2011;ISO 14040, 2006;ISO 14044, 2006). The ISO 14044 (2006) includes a hierarchical procedure explained well by Bjørn et al. (2018, p. 90): dividing impacts between cyclesi.e., allocationshould be avoided by (1) dividing the processes between the cycles and 'cutting off' the processes of secondary cycles. If this is not possible, then (2) 'system expansion' should be applied: multiple cycles are included in the system boundary (e.g., through displacement or avoidance of impacts). If system expansion is not possible, (3) allocation should be used. The European building LCA standards -EN 15804 (2012) and EN 15978 (2011) -handle multifunctionality by combining approaches. Impacts from production, use and waste disposal (module A-C) are calculated using the 'cut-off' allocation approach; the system boundary is extended to include re-use, recycling and recovery potential of building products and materials in one subsequent cycle. The net benefits and burdens are reported separately in the informational module D.Guidelines for dealing with multiple cycles (also named 'multifunctionality' or 'secondary functions') can be found in LCA standards (EN 15804, 2012;EN 15978, 2011;ISO 14040, 2006;ISO 14044, 2006).

        <p>In a CE-LCA, the abovementioned approach is problematic for two reasons. First, it is difficult to standardize crediting of re-use, recycling or recovery benefits (de Valk and Quik, 2017;Delem and Wastiels, 2019;Eberhardt et al., 2020;Wastiels et al., 2013). Second, cycles prior to the SL of the assessed building component or after one subsequent cycle remain invisible: they are not included in the scope of the assessment. In CE-LCA, the VRPs for all cycles in the building component system should be included in the system boundary of the assessment; these include VRPs inside and outside the assessed building component.In a CE-LCA, the abovementioned approach is problematic for two reasons.

        <p>We built upon EN 15804 (2012) andEN 15978 (2011) to develop a Circular Economy Life Cycle Assessment (CE-LCA) model for building components which fulfils the requirements identified in section 3. We explore how the methodological questions mentioned in the introduction can be addressed. We present the CE-LCA model following the LCA phases (adjusted from ISO 14040 (2006)): (1) goal and scope definition, (2) CE Life Cycle Inventory (CE-LCI), (3) CE Life Cycle Impact Assessment (CE-LCIA), and (4) interpretation of results.We built upon EN 15804 (2012) andEN 15978 (2011) to develop a Circular Economy Life Cycle Assessment (CE-LCA) model for building components which fulfils the requirements identified in section 3.

        <p>In current standards, the object of assessment is 'the building (component) during its SL, including re-use and recycling potential'; previous cycles and cycles after one future cycle are not considered. If we consider all cycles, the object becomes 'the entire building component system including all use cycles'. This might be useful to assess the impacts of entire circular systems. Yet, it hinders comparability of individual building components as impacts of multiple uses are integrated into one assessment. In CE-LCA the purpose is to assess a building component within a circular system. Herein we distinguish two possible objects of assessments. Consider, a kitchen with fronts which can be reused once. A possible object of assessment could be to determine the environmental impacts of an average kitchen within the circular system. We then assume that half of the fronts are made with virgin material and half with second-hand material. Such analysis is relevant to determine Environmental Product Declarations (EPD) of standardized designs, to assess a Product-Service System (PSS) or for LCAs in early-stage design. However, in some cases, we need to determine the impact of a specific kitchen within the circular system. For example, if we apply a kitchen with second-hand fronts in a building, we should only declare impacts of second-hand fronts. Such analysis is relevant in the context of LCAs for building projects. See Fig. 2 for an overview.In current standards, the object of assessment is 'the building (component) during its SL, including re-use and recycling potential'; previous cycles and cycles after one future cycle are not considered.

        <p>In EN 15978 (2011), the life cycle of a building (component) -and system boundary of the LCAis described in modules A, B, C, and D. We have adapted this framework, applying elements of the butterfly model of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (2013) and the VRP framework of Wouterszoon Jansen et al. (2020). We extended the system boundary to include all use cycles on all levels of the building component lifecycle. We identify four modules and 45 life cycle stages in a CE-LCA (see Figure 3). Module CE-A 'Production, construction and pre-use' commences with the extraction and supply of the virgin materials and ends with the installation of the assessed building component in the building. If non-virgin material is applied in the building component, module CE-A also includes all the previous use cycles of this material. Module CE-B is the use of the building component. Module CE-C reports all following VRPs of the building component, parts and materials. Module CE-D reports on the final disposal of the material back into the bio and techno sphere.In EN 15978 (2011), the life cycle of a building (component) -and system boundary of the LCAis described in modules A, B, C, and D.

        <p>In the LCA standards, the Reference Study Period (RSP) is aligned with the SL of the building (e.g., 60, 75, 100 years). At t = 0 the building (component) is constructed. At the end of the RSP, the building (component) is (assumed to be) demolished and materials are re-used, recycled or disposed. This approach increases comparability. In CE-LCA, the RSPand what happens whenis more precarious to determine. We assume that at t = 0 the building component is constructed and taken into use. Yet, materials and parts could have been produced and cycled prior to this moment (t&lt;0); and they might cycle long after the assumed SL of the building component has ended. To be able to assess if 'loops are slowed', the (functional, economic and technical) lifespans for the building component, parts and materials need to be reported exact. Therefore, the RSP should be determined by the longest, leading lifespan within the assessed building component. To ensure comparability, the impact may be calculated back to an impact/time unit (e.g., impact per x year(s)).In the LCA standards, the Reference Study Period (RSP) is aligned with the SL of the building (e.g., 60, 75, 100 years).

        <p>In phase 2 of the CE-LCA, the CE-LCI is made in accordance with the system boundary described in section 4.1.3. See a model flowchart in Fig. 3. Building components need to be inventoried as a composite of (e. g.,) parts and materials. Materials with different use cycles within their lifecycle and different lifespans should be distinguished; all VRPs and use cycles are inventoried. Processes occurring 'inside' the assessed building component are included in the 'foreground system'; processes occurring 'outside' are part of the 'extended foreground system'. Note that in the CE-LCIA (Section 4.3), impacts are allocated at the material level. So, processes taking place on part or building component levels (i. e., lifecycle stages CE-A.3.2 to CE-C.3.6) should be divided (e.g., based on mass) over and modelled on the associated material level. For example, a kitchen front (consisting of a coated board) is re-used. Then a fraction of the processes of the re-use cycle is included in the lifecycle of the board material and the remaining fraction in the lifecycle of the coating material.In phase 2 of the CE-LCA, the CE-LCI is made in accordance with the system boundary described in section 4.1.3.

Already introduced in the introduction, the LD (Allacker et al., 2017) or CE LD (Eberhardt et al., 2020) approach allocates impacts between cycles: the largest share of initial production and disposal impacts is allocated to the cycle where they occur, namely the first and last, respectively. The share of impacts allocated to following or previous cycles reduces linearly. The impacts of VRPs are divided evenly between cycles.Alternative approaches can be found in previous works on 'multicycle LCA' (mLCA) and research on allocation.

        <p>Different approaches could have merit in different instances. For short-cycling parts and materials when re-use and recycling avoids primary production of the same 'thing', applying the same processes, an equal distribution of impacts between all cycles could be reasonable (and simple). A condition is that quality or value should be retained throughout cycles. For example, for kitchens in which cabinets are reused twice, we could assume that for every cabinet only one-third of material is virgin. On the other hand, CE LD allocation is preferable when the building component, part or material is cascaded into something else (i.e., the value between cycles is not the same). In such instances, equal distribution between all cycles is undesirable and it becomes necessary to distinguish which cycle a building component, part or material is in. Furthermore, CE LD is more suitable for longcycling parts and materials, when it becomes less certain if, and what, impacts are avoided in the future.Different approaches could have merit in different instances.

        <p>The number of use cycles (N cycles ) for all materials applied in the building component is difficult to predict. N cycles influences how much impact is allocated to the assessed building component (through parameter Af ). If assumptions are optimistic, impacts might be spread over too many cycles and vice versa. So, the effects of adding or subtracting cycles should be tested. A distinction can be made between (1) known cycles, (2) likely past or future cycles, and (3) uncertain past or future cycles. The uncertainty is larger for cycles far into the future, for future cycles which are yet to be organised, when the partners who manufacture the building component are not involved in past or future cycles, or when materials are not traced through cycles (e.g., material passport). The analysis should focus on testing the most uncertain cycles.The number of use cycles (N cycles ) for all materials applied in the building component is difficult to predict.

The housing associations are a logical primary target group owning 30% of the nation's housing stock; they have a substantial interest in implementing CE principles. Their kitchens are basic, have a similar layout and, usually, no appliances are provided. Therefore, the design variants focussed on redesign of the cabinetry.

In this design variant, we assumed a similar technical, industrial and business model as the BAU kitchen. We assume The Plug-and-Play (P&amp;P) kitchen slows and closes loops by combining circular design strategies. It is a modular design, in which parts are separated based on their functional and technical lifespan. The cabinets consist of a construction (frame) with a long lifespan of 80 years. Infill parts, (e.g., drawers and shelves) have a medium lifespan between 20 and 40 years. The finishing parts (e.g., fronts) have shorter use cycles of 20 years. Parts are joint with de-and remountable connections, which facilitate future adjustments and re-use. The kitchen is made from plywood, to allow for a longer technical lifespan and multiple use cycles of parts. The kitchen manufacturer sells the kitchen to housing associations with a take-back guarantee and maintenance subscription. Extra kitchen modules and finishing-updates are offered to tenants through lease and sale-with-deposit contracts. At end of use, returned parts are sorted locally, to be re-used or sent back to the kitchen manufacturer where they are sorted to be remanufactured, recycled or recovered.The 'Reclaim! kitchen' is based on substituting virgin materials with non-virgin alternatives. In this design variant, we assumed a similar technical, industrial and business model as the BAU kitchen. We assume The Plug-and-Play (P&amp;P) kitchen slows and closes loops by combining circular design strategies. It is a modular design, in which parts are separated based on their functional and technical lifespan. The cabinets consist of a construction (frame) with a long lifespan of 80 years.

        <p>We compared the environmental impacts of the CIK variants and the BAU variant. The functional unit was 'the use of a specific configuration of a lower kitchen cabinet in a circular system over a period of 80 years'. The system boundary included life cycle stages CE-A to CE-D (as defined in 4.1.3). Yet, none of the variants had processes in stage CE-B and CE-D. In the foreground system, we excluded capital goods.We compared the environmental impacts of the CIK variants and the BAU variant.

        <p>The CIK design variants were developed to the level of concept or prototype. As these remain 'theoretical' designs for which suppliers and VRP-partners were unknown, estimations were made on transport distances, production, VRPs and disposal processes. We also estimated the number of use cycles, and functional and technical lifespans. The assumptions were based on the expectations on how various circular design strategies could perform (compared to the BAU variant). For example, if directly re-used materials were applied in the Reclaim! variant, we expect a lower technical lifespan than in the BAU kitchen. Additionally, the assumptions were based on experience of the housing associations and industry partners involved in the development. Furthermore, assumptions were aligned between variants (e.g., similar distance between manufacturer and user, similar recycling scenarios). For materials recycled in infinite 'open loops', we set N cycles at 10.The CIK design variants were developed to the level of concept or prototype.

            <rs type="software">openLCA</rs> version 
            <rs type="version">1.9</rs> software; the background system was modelled with the Ecoinvent 3.4 APOS database (Wernet et al., 2016), using system processes to get aggregated results. The CE-LCIA was calculated using characterization factors from the Centre for Environmental Studies (CML)-IA baseline (Guinée et al., 2001). CML includes 11 environmental, resource-depletion and toxicology midpoint impact categories and is commonly used by the building sector. We excluded biogenic carbon (e.g., in wood) from the impact assessment. As we consider all cycles, it is assumed that carbon uptake equals carbon emission over the lifecycle of the material; we question the fairness to give first cycles a benefit from carbon uptake occurring prior to initial use cycles. Therefore, we applied the '0-0 rule' to biogenic carbon. The CE-LCIA parameters were determined for each material (see appendix 3). The value differs between cycles, so we applied the CE LD approach to determine Af . As the object of assessment was a specific configuration of a lower kitchen cabinet, P is set at 1: each inventoried VRP is assumed to occur.

        <p>The results of the CE-LCIA are summarised in Table 1. The Reclaim! kitchen has a lower environmental impact than the BAU on 6 of the 11 impact categories. P&amp;P realises a significant impact reduction in all indicators in comparison to the BAU case. We refer to appendix 4 for further analysis on the impact distribution between 'production, construction and pre-use' and 'value retention post-use', allocation of impacts to the kitchen over the RSP, and the distribution of impacts between use cycles of materials applied in the kitchen over time.The results of the CE-LCIA are summarised in Table 1.

When cycles were added, we assumed local, direct re-use for the entire kitchen cabinet; when cycles were subtracted, we removed the 'outer' cycles (i.e., recycling) first, followed by remanufacturing and re-use, respectively. Only the industry standard incineration for energy recovery and open-loop recycling were retained. For the P&amp;P kitchen, scenario 'C-3 ′ can be considered a linear scenario.We analysed the sensitivity of the N cycles by adding one cycle ('C+1 ′ ), two cycles ('C+2 ′ ) and subtracting (up to) three cycles ('C-1 ′ , 'C-2 ′ , 'C-3 ′ ) from the baseline scenario.

        <p>We tested the sensitivity varying L functional and L technical of (parts of) the kitchen variants. In the BAU and Reclaim! kitchen, all parts have the same lifespan and the L functional and L technical are equal. Any changes to either results in the replacement of the entire kitchen. On the other hand, P&amp;P kitchen parts have different lifespans and L technical of finishing parts is longer than L functional . So, we varied both L functional of finishing parts and L functional and L technical of all parts in parallel. To make the scenarios comparable, lifespans were varied between ±7 and 80 years. Note that such a long lifespan is unlikely for the BAU and Reclaim! kitchens as their materials have shorter lifespans, and these kitchens are not adaptable.We tested the sensitivity varying L functional and L technical of (parts of) the kitchen variants.

        <p>For the BAU, adding two cycles (C+2) reduced impacts between 31% and 47% compared to its baseline scenario; for the Reclaim! kitchen, the reduction is only between 10% and 20%. The deviation is less as the difference between Af is larger when adding a re-use cycle to virgin material then to material in a second use cycle. From the P&amp;P variant we found that additional cycles do not necessarily lead to less allocated impact: removing the outer recycling processes in scenario C-1 resulted in impact savings between -4% and 73% compared to the baseline scenario. So, adding cycles with relatively high impact processes does not reduce impacts. The most beneficial cycles are the direct, local re-use cycles of scenarios C+1 and C+2 which lead to significant savings in all variants on all impact categories.For the BAU, adding two cycles (C+2) reduced impacts between 31% and 47% compared to its baseline scenario; for the Reclaim! kitchen, the reduction is only between 10% and 20%.

        <p>We found that varying L functional and L technical in parallel results in significant deviations from the baseline scenarios: a proportional relationship is visible. For the P&amp;P, we found that only varying L functional is less impactful: although more finishing parts need to be placed (i.e., R increases), they are also re-used more often. Therefore, the Af of finishing parts decreases and less impact is allocated to the kitchen. If all variants are compared on a 20-year L technical (see appendix 6, Table A6.2), the Reclaim! variant decreases environmental impacts between 35%-60% compared to the BAU. The P&amp;P results in a -38% to 10% reduction compared to the BAU. This has two reasons: finishing parts are still replaced every 10 years; the circular design principle of the P&amp;P designfacilitating partial replacements to keep the whole of the kitchen in use longeris nullified in this scenario.We found that varying L functional and L technical in parallel results in significant deviations from the baseline scenarios: a proportional relationship is visible.

        <p>From the CE-LCIA and sensitivity analyses, we conclude the following: First, applying non-virgin material, can reduce the environmental impact. However, if the lifespan of the kitchen is reducedresulting in a higher replacement ratereductions in impact can be nullified. Additionally, the impacts of initial production and construction of non-virgin materials remain visible, so using non-virgin is less attractive if these materials had a high(er) initial production and construction impact. Second, facilitating multiple cycles results in a lower (allocated) environmental impact, particularly for direct, local re-use cycles. High-impact recycling cycles are less attractive. Third, we found that the P&amp;P kitchen resulted in the least environmental impacts through longer use of parts, introducing more use-cycles of components, parts and materials and facilitating partial replacement of parts. Yet further environmental impact reduction is possible by combining variants: a P&amp;P kitchen in which non-virgin materials are applied, but only if these materials do not lower the technical lifespan of the kitchen.From the CE-LCIA and sensitivity analyses, we conclude the following: First, applying non-virgin material, can reduce the environmental impact.

Determining all use cycles on all levels of a building component is complex: it extends beyond the control of building component manufacturers and the scope of building projects. Including multiple cyclessome far into the future increases uncertainty. Burdens could be shifted to cycles which might not come to pass, making CE-LCA sensitive to misuse.

        <p>Our findings corroborate Allacker et al. (2017): including multiple cycles within the scope of the assessed product results in the best 'physical realism' for multi-cycling products [or building components] within the circular system.

Howeveras concluded by Allacker et al. (2017), De Wolf et al. (2020) and Eberhardt et al. (2021) we found that all cycles of the building component system are difficult to determine in a practice setting; this increases uncertainty, makes the approach sensitive to mis-use and could hinder reducing environmental impacts both in the short and long term.Our findings corroborate Allacker et al.

        <p>Yet, our recommendation differs from Allacker et al. (2017). They suggested to not include all cycles; we suggest that applying CE-LCA, or equivalent multi-cycling LCA, is necessary to transition to a 'truly' circular built environment. Without including all cycles within the assessment, we cannot get an accurate overview of the burdens and benefits of circularity. Yet, we urge the utmost care with CE-LCA in practice. We propose two pathways to manage the disadvantages of CE-LCA. First, the CE-LCA approach could be developed further to reduce uncertainty, improve accuracy, usability and fair-use: the CE LD allocation approach does not yet incorporate length of use cycles; regulations (or 'templates') on how to approach various types of cycles for different materials could be developed; CE-LCA should be tested with industry. Alternatively, LCA which does not include all cycles could be optimised to incentivise narrowing, slowing and closing (all) cycles now and in the future. Consider, for example, the 'Circular Footprint Formula' as part of the Product Environmental Footprint method (Zampori and Pant, 2019). Yet, blending approaches could also increase complexity and cloud the (dis)advantages of each approach. A second pathway is to exercise awareness of the value and limitations of CE-LCA and use the model appropriately. A CE-LCA should include extensive sensitivity analysis and/or could be done in parallel to standard LCAfunctioning as a 'circular potential' informational module.

        <p>Future research could also focus on CE-LCA for the building level. Although, the testcase in this paper does not support building CE-LCA, theoretically, this model could be applied to buildings. Especially if the building is considered as a composite of building components. Undoubtedly, this increases the complexity of CE-LCA. Additionally, more knowledge is needed on which design variants for circular buildings and components perform best environmentally to support the transition to a 'truly' circular built environment.

As such it makes an important step to support the assessment of circularity in the built environment and, subsequently, to the transition to a CE in the built environment.We conclude that the CE-LCA model can successfully support LCAs of circular building componentsespecially in theoretical setting; the stepby-step description of the model and example case can provide practical guidance for future assessments.

(2020) propose in their CE LD approach to set the F on 50; we applied this in the case of the circular kitchen. The value for N cycles is determined by the number of use cycles for the material, represented by C number, n in Figure A1.1. This value should be found in the CE-LCI of the building material. Please note that VRPs indicate the start of a new use cycle, for example, re-use, remanufacturing, recycling, composting, or recovery; we do not consider the final disposal of a material as a use cycle.Where F is the factor determining how much more impact is allocated to the first use cycle versus the last use cycle.

Introducing multiple use cycles results in higher shares of impact originating from 'value retention post-use': in the P&amp;P kitchen, only 53-79% of impacts originate from production, construction and pre-use. An exception is the 'abiotic depletion for elements' category, where only 23% are production, construction and pre-use impacts. This is due to the high abiotic depletion potential of 'wood chipping for OSB production' during recycling of wooden parts. The effect of including multiple cycles is also visible in the stainless-steel connectors: the assumed 10 recycling cycles for virgin stainless steel result in an Af of 0.18 for initial production and construction impacts and an Af of 0.09 for impacts of each recycling cycle. As such the share of impacts of value retention post-use is larger than the share of impacts of production, construction and pre-use: double or triple for the first five impact categories. However, the distribution of impacts also greatly depends on impacts emanating from production versus recycling processes. For example, in the toxicity categories, the impacts from initial production and construction of stainless steel still contribute the majority share. Which materials or processes contribute most to the results varies per impact category. From the CE-LCI, we see that the panels form the bulk of the material in the BAU and Reclaim! kitchens and the infill and finishing parts in the P&amp;P kitchen. Their initial production and construction contribute significantly in nearly all impact categories; in the P&amp;P kitchen the recycling process 'chipping for OSB production' results in high share of impacts, especially in the abiotic depletion for elements category. However, considering the limited mass of the stainless steel and coatings (i.e., melamine), we found that these materials contribute significantly to the total impacts, especially for the toxicity categories. When normalising the results (see also appendix 6, Table A6.3), we found these are most significant. Finally, most of the impact originates from material production and VRPs; transport played a limited role.Detailed CE-LCI for the Plug-and-Play (P&amp;P) kitchen. use.

        <p>To illustrate how impacts are allocated to the kitchen over the RSP we plotted the (allocated) GWP over time in Figure A4.1. The y-axis shows the years within the RSP when impact is allocated to the kitchen. For the BAU and Reclaim! variants, impacts are allocated to the kitchen when the entire kitchen cabinet is placed and replaced every 20 or 10 years, respectively. For the P&amp;P kitchen the largest shares of impact are allocated at initial placement (t = 0), and the replacement of the finishing, infill and connectors (t = 40). The replacement of the finishing and part of the infill at t = 20 and t = 60 result in a modest increase in allocated impact, showing the benefit of facilitating partial replacements.To illustrate how impacts are allocated to the kitchen over the RSP we plotted the (allocated) GWP over time in Figure A4.1.

        <p>The above mentioned results merely show the impacts of the circular system allocated to the kitchen. Neither Table A4.1 nor Figure A4.1 provides insight into the distribution of impacts between the use cycle in the kitchen and the use cycles happening 'outside' of the assessed kitchen. Reporting the impacts allocated 'inside' and 'outside' of the use cycle of the assessed kitchen does not necessarily lead to more transparency. First, impacts which have already occurred in the use cycle of the kitchen are allocated to cycles occurring 'outside' of the assessed kitchen. Likewise, some of the impacts of cycles which are yet to occur have already been allocated to the use cycle of the kitchen. Second, depending on which materials are applied, impacts 'outside' of the assessed kitchen could compile impacts of multiple use cycles. For metals used in the kitchen, impacts outside the use cycle of the kitchen include impacts of 10 recycling cycles. Whilst for particle boards in the BAU variant, it only includes impacts of one use cycle (e.g., recovery of particle board for energy). To increase the transparency of multi-cycling LCAs, the impacts could be reported per use cycleper material.The above mentioned results merely show the impacts of the circular system allocated to the kitchen.

Appendix 1. Determining the allocation fraction in CE-LCA using an equal distribution or CE LD allocation approach</p>
        <p>In this appendix we explain how to determine the allocation fractionparameter Afin a Circular Economy Life Cycle Assessment (CE-LCA) of a building component following an equal distribution approach or using the Circular Economy Linearly Degressive (CE LD) approach (Eberhardt et al., 2020). As discussed in section 3.4.1 of this paper, Af determines the fraction of impact of the building component system that is allocated to the assessed building component. In CE-LCA, the impacts are calculated on material level using Eq. (3). There, the Af specifies how much impact of each lifecycle stage within a material's life cycle is allocated to the use cycle where the material is applied in the assessed building component.In this appendix we explain how to determine the allocation fractionparameter Afin a Circular Economy Life Cycle Assessment (CE-LCA) of a building component following an equal distribution approach or using the Circular Economy Linearly Degressive (CE LD) approach (Eberhardt et al., 2020).

        <p>Af is influenced by the total number of use cycles within a material's lifecycle, captured by parameter N cycles . For example, before wood is applied in the assessed building componenta façadeit had a previous use cycle in another building (use cycle 1); after use in the façade (use cycle 2), the wood is chipped for OSB production (use cycle 3); after that use cycle, the wood is incinerated for energy production (use cycle 4). In this case the number of use cycles within the wood lifecycle (N cycles ) is 4. If impacts are distributed equally between cycles and we assume the cycles are of equal length, the value of Af equals a fraction of N cycles (see equation A1.1a):Af is influenced by the total number of use cycles within a material's lifecycle, captured by parameter N cycles . For example, before wood is applied in the assessed building componenta façadeit had a previous use cycle in another building (use cycle 1); after use in the façade (use cycle 2), the wood is chipped for OSB production (use cycle 3); after that use cycle, the wood is incinerated for energy production (use cycle 4). In this case the number of use cycles within the wood lifecycle (N cycles ) is 4. If impacts are distributed equally between cycles and we assume the cycles are of equal length, the value of Af equals a fraction of N cycles (see equation A1.1a):</p>
        <p>If impacts are distributed equally and the cycles are not of equal length, the length of the current cycle (Δt current cycle ) can be divided by the length of all use cycles within the material's lifecycle (Δt all cycles ) using equation A1.1b.If impacts are distributed equally and the cycles are not of equal length, the length of the current cycle (Δt current cycle ) can be divided by the length of all use cycles within the material's lifecycle (Δt all cycles ) using equation A1.1b.</p>

        <p>The CE LD approach divides impacts from initial production and construction (all life cycle stages before the first use), VRPs (all life cycle stages after first use and prior to disposal), and disposal differently. The majority share of the impact is allocated to the use cycle where the impacts occur. For the initial production and construction this is cycle number (C number ) 1. The share of impact allocated to subsequent cycles decreases linearly (see Fig. A1.1). For disposal impacts the majority share is allocated to the last cycle and impacts are allocated to previous cycles in a linearly degressive manner. The impacts of VRPs are allocated equally over all use cycles. Note that the impacts from initial production and construction, VRPs and disposal allocated per use cycles should add up to 100% of the impacts generated throughout the entire lifecycle (represented by the grey area in Figure A1.1). In other words, impacts over the entire lifecycle do not 'disappear'.The CE LD approach divides impacts from initial production and construction (all life cycle stages before the first use), VRPs (all life cycle stages after first use and prior to disposal), and disposal differently.

        <p>The CE LD approach consists of a series of equations: how the impacts are divided between cycles depends on two parameters. First, on the total number of use cycles within the materials lifecycle -parameter N cycles . Second, a factor (F) determining how much more impact of initial production and construction should be allocated to the first cycle versus the last cycle; vice versa for the disposal impacts. To apply the CE LD approach in the CE-LCA of a building component, the Afof initial production and construction, VRPs and disposal of each material (with different use cycles) applied in the building component needs to be determined.The CE LD approach consists of a series of equations: how the impacts are divided between cycles depends on two parameters.
