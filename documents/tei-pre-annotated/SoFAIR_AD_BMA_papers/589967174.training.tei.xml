        <p>This paper goes beyond the relationship between a bank ESG performance (ESGP) and corporate financial performance (CFP). Here, the link between ESG factors and financial benchmarks is analysed to verify whether banks may find in the market reaction sufficient stimuli (higher CFP) to adopt ESG conduct spontaneously. Using panel estimation methods on European banks listed in STOXX Europe 600, between 2008 and 2019, this paper tests the relationship between ESGP and CFP considering different dimensions of financial performance at once, both accounted-based (ROA and ROE) and market-based (Capitalisation to Book Value, Tobin's Q). Besides, we employ VBM (EVA Spread) not previously considered. The main findings support the current approach of banking authorities, focusing on bank ESG risks, more than ESG opportunities, in order to "force" banks into adopting a new ESG business model, at this early stage of transition to sustainability.This paper goes beyond the relationship between a bank ESG performance (ESGP) and corporate financial performance (CFP).

        <p>A growing strand of literature on banking business models have started to focus on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues as new promising paradigms for business management (Galbreath, 2013). The attention on ESG issues in the bank decision-making processes (particularly for lending decisions) is driven by heightened pressure from shareholders and different stakeholders (Houston &amp; Shan, 2019). The shareholders, as usual, are interested in those ESG practices that can increase their financial wealth (Friedman, 1962); the second (e.g., consumers, investors, businesses, employees, and governments) are moved from a variety of instances regarding ESG issues. For instance, policymakers and international institutions, involved in fostering sustainable economic growth, count on the prominent role of banks in the development of countries, due to their role as investment project selectors and risk managers (Beck, Demirgüç-Kunt, &amp; Levine, 2010). The underlying assumption is that, if banks were willing to change their investment strategies encompassing ESG factors, then sustainable growth could be possible (Ahmend, Ahmed, &amp; Hasan, 2018;EBA, 2020).A growing strand of literature on banking business models have started to focus on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues as new promising paradigms for business management (Galbreath, 2013).

        <p>In this scenario, at the EU level, regulators and supervisors have pictured a precise ESG path that will lead banks to include ESG factors in their risk appetite framework by 2023 (EC, 2018;ECB, 2020). Moreover, the EBA has identified priorities and objectives for the integration of ESG factors into the EU banking regulatory and supervisory framework (EBA, 2020).In this scenario, at the EU level, regulators and supervisors have pictured a precise ESG path that will lead banks to include ESG factors in their risk appetite framework by 2023 (EC, 2018;ECB, 2020).

        <p>After the latest financial crisis, it seems that banks are exploring costs, risks and opportunities of reinventing their business under the umbrella of sustainability to restore the trust lost by some of their stakeholders. This leverages the growing attention of stakeholders to the new socially responsible practices (Carroll &amp; Schwartz, 2003) and the application of proper governance practices (Cucari, Esposito De Falco, &amp; Orlando, 2018;Widyawati, 2020).After the latest financial crisis, it seems that banks are exploring costs, risks and opportunities of reinventing their business under the umbrella of sustainability to restore the trust lost by some of their stakeholders.

        <p>While the value added in including ESG practices in their strategies may be less evident to banks (compared to other sectors), the longterm benefits may be equally significant. For example, preferring investments that include ESG factors in the selection process enables banks to finance more robust projects and businesses with more stable profitability (Ioannou &amp; Serafeim, 2019). This class of investments is hailed due to its ability to align long-term economic and social environmental performance objectives (OECD, 2020). Also, including social goals in internal processes can allow efficiency recoveries and reduction of costs. Furthermore, according to Serafeim (2020), the attention to ESG issues helps the management to reduce the cost of capital (Dhaliwal, Li, Tsang, &amp; Yang, 2011) and expand the shareholder base.While the value added in including ESG practices in their strategies may be less evident to banks (compared to other sectors), the longterm benefits may be equally significant.

        <p>In the light of the above, it is crucial to understand whether banks find sufficient stimuli to be spontaneously ESG-oriented, or whether it is necessary to "force" them with regulatory prescriptions.In the light of the above, it is crucial to understand whether banks find sufficient stimuli to be spontaneously ESG-oriented, or whether it is necessary to "force" them with regulatory prescriptions.</p>
        <p>Therefore, looking for evidence from a positive relationship between Environmental, Social and Governance Performance (ESGP) and Corporate Financial Performance (CFP), this paper aims to investigate the motivation of banks to undertake voluntary ESG practises.Therefore, looking for evidence from a positive relationship between Environmental, Social and Governance Performance (ESGP) and Corporate Financial Performance (CFP), this paper aims to investigate the motivation of banks to undertake voluntary ESG practises.</p>
        <p>Even if the relationship between ESGP and CFP of firms has been explored in several previous studies, using different ESG dimensions and performance measures as evidenced by the abundance of literature reviews on the subject (Busch &amp; Friede, 2018;del Mar Miras-Rodríguez, Carrasco-Gallego, &amp; Escobar-Pérez, 2015;Hou, Liu, Fan, &amp; Wei, 2016;López-Arceiz, Bellostas, &amp; Rivera, 2018;Lu &amp; Taylor, 2016;Revelli &amp; Viviani, 2015;Rost &amp; Ehrmann, 2017;Wang, Dou, &amp; Jia, 2016), only a small number of studies is related to the banking system (Buallay, 2019;Buallay, Fadel, Al-Ajmi, &amp; Saudagaran, 2020;Buallay, Hamdan, &amp; Barone, 2019;Cornett, Erhemjamts, &amp; Tehranian, 2016;Forgione, Laguir, &amp; Staglianò, 2020;Miralles-Quirós, Miralles-Quirós, &amp; Redondo Hernández, 2019;Miralles-Quirós, Miralles-Quirós, &amp; Redondo-Hernández, 2019;Miralles-Quirós, Miralles-Quirós, &amp; Valente Gonçalves, 2018;Nizam, Ng, Dewandaru, Nagayev, &amp; Nkoba, 2019;Shakil, Mahmood, Tasnia, &amp; Munim, 2019). According to Finger, Gavious, and Manos (2018), this is because banks have peculiarities that lead to operating according to a shared regulation, which requires them to follow fixed rules, in terms of accounting and reporting. These peculiarities, together with process specificities, and often standardised and opaque information, tend to exclude banks from studies with multi-sector samples (Miralles-Quirós, Miralles-Quirós, &amp; Redondo-Hernández, 2019).Even if the relationship between ESGP and CFP of firms has been explored in several previous studies, using different ESG dimensions and performance measures as evidenced by the abundance of literature reviews on the subject (Busch &amp; Friede, 2018;del Mar Miras-Rodríguez, Carrasco-Gallego, &amp; Escobar-Pérez, 2015;Hou, Liu, Fan, &amp; Wei, 2016;López-Arceiz, Bellostas, &amp; Rivera, 2018;Lu &amp; Taylor, 2016;Revelli &amp; Viviani, 2015;Rost &amp; Ehrmann, 2017;Wang, Dou, &amp; Jia, 2016), only a small number of studies is related to the banking system (Buallay, 2019;Buallay, Fadel, Al-Ajmi, &amp; Saudagaran, 2020;Buallay, Hamdan, &amp; Barone, 2019;Cornett, Erhemjamts, &amp; Tehranian, 2016;Forgione, Laguir, &amp; Staglianò, 2020;Miralles-Quirós, Miralles-Quirós, &amp; Redondo Hernández, 2019;Miralles-Quirós, Miralles-Quirós, &amp; Redondo-Hernández, 2019;Miralles-Quirós, Miralles-Quirós, &amp; Valente Gonçalves, 2018;Nizam, Ng, Dewandaru, Nagayev, &amp; Nkoba, 2019;Shakil, Mahmood, Tasnia, &amp; Munim, 2019).

        <p>Since the concept of ESG was introduced (Compact, 2004), ESG performance has received much attention from scholars. First, ESG dimensions are used in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) studies to investigate the effect on profitability and value creation of socially responsible conduct voluntarily adopted by management. Second, in Social and Responsible Investing (SRI), ESG measures are employed as a proxy for the investment strategy that integrates ESG concerns with financial objectives into investment decision-making (Renneboog, Horst, &amp; Zhang, 2008).Since the concept of ESG was introduced (Compact, 2004), ESG performance has received much attention from scholars.

        <p>There is a significant part of literature that underlines the evolution of CSR and ESG and their related issues (Carroll, 2008;Sheehy, 2015;Montiel &amp; Delgado-Ceballos, 2014;Huang, 2019). CSR is theoretically rooted in the stakeholder theory (Freeman, 1984;Jones, 1995), which implies identifying a firm's stakeholders and integration of their interests into the profit-maximising objectives of the firm. Starting from stakeholder theory and going through a CSR framework and CG best practices, different scholars have tried to demonstrate how important it is to meet both shareholder and stakeholder expectations to create value. Although the shareholders share the financial wealth (Friedman, 1962), the stakeholders (including employees, customers, local communities) are the final bearers of risk concerning the social impact (Freeman &amp; Liedtka, 1991). The ESG can be considered as the evolution of the concept of CSR (Aguinis, 2011), since it specifies three core typologies of stakeholder-firm relationships: environmental, social and governance (Hassel &amp; Semenova, 2013) and, in this sense, regarded as the modern "idea" of social responsibility (Barnett, 2007;Carroll, 1991;Clarkson, 1995;Donaldson &amp; Preston, 1995;Wood, 1991).There is a significant part of literature that underlines the evolution of CSR and ESG and their related issues (Carroll, 2008;Sheehy, 2015;Montiel &amp; Delgado-Ceballos, 2014;Huang, 2019).

        <p>By taking this approach, the ESGP becomes a tool of addressing the requirements of stakeholders in terms of ESG initiative and providing them with the knowledge to evaluate business practices. For stakeholder theorists, and followers of the "doing-good-while-doing-well" hypothesis (Kramer &amp; Porter, 2011), ESG performance leads to better profits and market value by ensuring: (a) lower explicit costs (e.g., potential penalties and taxes); (b) greater operational efficiency (Brammer &amp; Millington, 2005;Porter &amp; Kramer, 2002); (c) recovery of employee productivity and a broader consumer base (Margolis, Elfenbein, &amp; Walsh, 2007); (d) improved corporate reputation (Dhaliwal, Radhakrishnan, Tsang, &amp; Yang, 2012);By taking this approach, the ESGP becomes a tool of addressing the requirements of stakeholders in terms of ESG initiative and providing them with the knowledge to evaluate business practices.

        <p>Following this approach, since CSR practices of companies lead to the distribution of results to both shareholders and all stakeholders, helping to enhance long-term corporate growth and financial performance, then ESGPs are strictly related to CFP (Shirasu &amp; Kawakita, 2020).

The Paris agreement on climate change has defined how financial market participants, and financial advisors, should integrate ESG risks and opportunities into their processes as part of their duty to act in the best interests of their clients.Following this approach, since CSR practices of companies lead to the distribution of results to both shareholders and all stakeholders, helping to enhance long-term corporate growth and financial performance, then ESGPs are strictly related to CFP (Shirasu &amp; Kawakita, 2020).

        <p>To verify the validity and the consistency of instrumental variables chosen, we tested the five models applying the Hausman test (Hausman, 1978). Results revealed that, for Models 2-5, marked by a Prob &gt; χ 2 0.0000 (Table 5), the estimator within (Fixed effects, Fe) was the most suitable, which made us reject the null hypothesis for the individual α i effects which significantly correlated with at least one regressor. On the other hand, after finding a high Prob &gt; χ 2 0.7035 for Model 1, we explored the possibility of better estimates using Random effects (Re). Results of Breusch and Pagan Lagrange Multiplier, Prob &gt; χ 2 0.000, (Breusch &amp; Pagan, 1980) suggested that the GLS estimator (Re) was the most appropriate to describe Model 1, excluding the OLS option. In the case of Model 1, panel data model estimates could be expressed with the following:To verify the validity and the consistency of instrumental variables chosen, we tested the five models applying the Hausman test (Hausman, 1978).

        <p>Examining the regression results (Table 5), we must point out relevant differences with previous empirical research. Our estimates exhibited a lack of causal effect between ESGP and both ROA and ROE in the banking sector, unlike studies that find evidence of a positive and statistically significant relationship with both CFPs (Buallay, 2019;Buallay et al., 2020;Cornett et al., 2014), or with ROE (Buallay, 2019;Cornett et al., 2016;Nizam et al., 2019), and those who revealed a negative relationship (Buallay et al., 2019). Exploring Analysing the extent to which the ESGP may influence Tobin's Q (Model 3), results showed that the coefficient of the variable that represents the interaction between ESGP-CFP is statistically significant whereas negative (-0.00072833***), supporting Buallay et al. (2019).Examining the regression results (Table 5), we must point out relevant differences with previous empirical research.

        <p>CFP in Model 3 also seems influenced by the capability of banks to absorb expected losses, confirming the attitude of this ratio to favour better evaluation in the stock market of banks (Miralles-Quirós, Miralles-Quirós, &amp; Redondo Hernández, 2019).CFP in Model 3 also seems influenced by the capability of banks to absorb expected losses, confirming the attitude of this ratio to favour better evaluation in the stock market of banks (Miralles-Quirós, Miralles-Quirós, &amp; Redondo Hernández, 2019).</p>

        <p>Finally, focus was on metrics that could help managers and investors to discriminate if a company points in the direction of wealth creation. In Model 1, we highlighted the relationship between ESGP and EVA_S, which helps investors to evaluate the direction in which companies moved in terms of value creation. We have chosen EVA_S as CFP in believing that incorporating ESG parameters in the management process may result in higher and more stable margins and a lower cost of capital. Our results appear to confirm the initial hypothesis displaying a positive and significant correlation (EVA_S, 0.02771013*). The low value is because EVA_S is almost always negative during the period considered. The LTD, measuring the coverage of loans with stable funding, is negatively correlated to the bank performance but only significant in the case of EVA_S. This was probably owing to a higher value of the ratio connected with a higher cost of funding, directly affecting WACC.Finally, focus was on metrics that could help managers and investors to discriminate if a company points in the direction of wealth creation.

        <p>The relationship between ESGP and CFP has been extensively investigated in several areas, with fewer inconclusive studies in the banking sector. The topic is relevant since banks are themselves the object of investment, and, at the same time, play a crucial role in the allocation of resources in the economy: selecting investment, managing risks, and deciding who merits access to capital and what activities deserve to be financed (Beck et al., 2010).The relationship between ESGP and CFP has been extensively investigated in several areas, with fewer inconclusive studies in the banking sector.

        <p>The presence of a positive and verifiable relationship between ESGP and CFP would mean that bank management finds strong incentives to adopt such conduct, including selecting sustainable projects. In this manner, a virtuous circle would be set in motion to drive both banks as companies themselves and companies to see their sustainable-driven projects funded.The presence of a positive and verifiable relationship between ESGP and CFP would mean that bank management finds strong incentives to adopt such conduct, including selecting sustainable projects.

        <p>Previous studies carried out in the banking sector have mainly Even where statistically significant, the results do not seem to provide a strong indication of incentives, in terms of profitability, to direct bank management towards ESG practices, when adopting a short-term vision. These results also justify the current approach of banking authorities, who concentrate their supervisory perspectives on bank ESG risk, which, at this stage, are likely to appear as the main driver to "force" banks into adopting a new ESG business model.Previous studies carried out in the banking sector have mainly Even where statistically significant, the results do not seem to provide a strong indication of incentives, in terms of profitability, to direct bank management towards ESG practices, when adopting a short-term vision.

        <p>Further investigations could take into account risk-adjusted performance measures in order to assess if the approach of banking authorities may be supported by evidence, as well as ESG ratings, in order to better capture the ESG attitude of banks. Also, it would be advisable to envisage regulatory impulses that can trigger the virtuous circle that leads bank managers to a long-term vision consistent with sustainable growth. In this way, banks would be pushed to embrace the "ESG philosophy" more comprehensively, and not only for short-term green-washing marketing strategies.Further investigations could take into account risk-adjusted performance measures in order to assess if the approach of banking authorities may be supported by evidence, as well as ESG ratings, in order to better capture the ESG attitude of banks.
