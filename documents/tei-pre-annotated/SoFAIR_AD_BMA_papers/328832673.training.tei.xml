        <p>Abstract-Pandemics and other forms of epidemic outbreaks are a unique case of manufacturing risk typified by high uncertainty, increasing propagation and long-term disruption to manufacturers, supply chain actors as well as the end-users and consumers. For manufacturing the COVID-19 disruption scope has been largely two-fold; an endogenous disruption of manufacturing processes and systems as well as extreme shifts in demand and supply caused by exogenous supply chain disruption. Existing literature on disruptions in manufacturing suggests that pandemics are qualitatively different from typical disruptions. There is no literature available to manufacturing practitioners that identify the barriers and enablers of manufacturing resilience, especially with regards to pivoting of the manufacturing sector in response to a pandemic. This study draws on an extensive survey collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. The respondents were employees of manufacturing firms in all regions of the world who had engaged in manufacturing during the pandemic or had opted out from manufacturing due to various identified reasons. By collating their responses, we offer to practitioners and policymakers an analysis for identifying a bestpractice framework for pivoting successfully as a response to major manufacturing disruptions. Index Terms-manufacturing, manufacturing resilience, COVID-19, coronavirus, pivoting, digital technologies, pandemic, supply chain disruption.Abstract-Pandemics and other forms of epidemic outbreaks are a unique case of manufacturing risk typified by high uncertainty, increasing propagation and long-term disruption to manufacturers, supply chain actors as well as the end-users and consumers.

        <p>Beyond pandemics and epidemics, manufacturing and supply chains have experienced large-scale disruption due to natural disasters and political risks. The impact of the 2011 tsunami event on the Japanese car manufacturing industry led to closures of Sony, Toyota and Nissan factories in Japan and the United Kingdom. The US-China "Trade War", with its highest impact in 2019, caused many Chinese manufacturers to shift production facilities to other parts of South East Asia [4]. Car sales in the UK experienced its worst month since 1946 in April 2020, as sales fell by 97% [5].Beyond pandemics and epidemics, manufacturing and supply chains have experienced large-scale disruption due to natural disasters and political risks.

        <p>Overall, statistics show that disruptions caused by unexpected and catastrophic events are increasing and organizational disruptions are at their highest. Traditionally, servitization, the shift from a product-centric to a service-centric business model and logic, has helped manufacturing firms to stabilize their firms in the face of disruption [6]. Despite the availability of such options, manufacturing is expected to be one of the most severely affected sectors in terms of the negative economic impact [7]. This outcome is due to the sheer scale of the crisis and the extreme methods taken to mitigate it. Some manufacturing firms took responsibility for supplying critical equipment and devices needed by the public and medical institutions. Specifically, repurposing and pivotingthe process of manufacturers rapidly switching to a new product or process-has been successfully implemented by some manufacturers. Many found it challenging to repurpose. This study assesses survey responses from 71 manufacturing practitioners across North America, Europe, Asia, South America and Africa. We identify the enablers and barriers of manufacturing repurposing within the context of disruption caused by COVID-19. We establish the assumption that these enablers and barriers are similar across regions as long as the context is restricted to manufacturing firms and pandemic disruption.Overall, statistics show that disruptions caused by unexpected and catastrophic events are increasing and organizational disruptions are at their highest.

        <p>The electronic survey included identifying the kinds of manufacturing industries globally available. For these categorizations we used the American Enterprise Institute2 website which had developed a tableau interface for corporate responses to Covid-19; manufacturing industries were also identified from the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) 3 website. We thus identified 39 manufacturing industries. We identified 13 countries based on the pandemic spread and growth from the Johns Hopkins University's Coronavirus Resource Centre and gave allowance for other countries to ensure a global outlook. Our survey also captured nonmanufacturing industries as we attempted to track their enablers and barriers to operations during the disruption.The electronic survey included identifying the kinds of manufacturing industries globally available.

        <p>A UNIDO report also observes several of these barriers [16]. Beyond these identified barriers, current literature argues that firms which operate or support their operations with servitized business models-including leasing and renting of products-are more resilient than traditional models purely focused on selling products [12]. Fluctuating demand and supply was also identified as a barrier by respondents. The next section provides some recommendations for manufacturing practitioners and managers based on these findings.

        <p>Traditional manufacturing "toolboxes" do not offer best-practice frameworks that can be used for structured approaches in preparing for and responding to disruptive events. The lean toolbox provides blueprints for achieving value at the lowest possible cost by maximizing flows in stable demand conditions; whilst the agile paradigm with decoupling points, caters mainly for responsiveness to demand fluctuations on existing product lines. This situation has in many cases resulted in reactive planning and deadlocked schedules of production with manufacturing operations detrimentally affected. For example, Scania-a vehicle manufacturer-has had to temporarily close its manufacturing facilities for over three weeks, and may not return to full production capacity until 2021. An updated toolbox should be created to enable manufacturers to prepare for higher levels of resilience that account for the needs of pivoting and repurposing, by incorporating a systematic factoring of the identified key challenges, barriers and opportunities for manufacturing. For maximum impact such a toolbox would need to be tailored to the specific industrial sector and regional context of each enterprise with a holistic engagement of its supply network.Traditional manufacturing "toolboxes" do not offer best-practice frameworks that can be used for structured approaches in preparing for and responding to disruptive events.

For maximum impact such a toolbox would need to be tailored to the specific industrial sector and regional context of each enterprise with a holistic engagement of its supply network.</p>
        <p>We identified that several manufacturers and service-sector providers were successful in weathering the pandemic crisis. For example, the Volvo Group did not report any fluctuation in service revenue in the first quarter of 2020--which was near the peak months of the disruption, March -2020. Organizational flexibility was highlighted as the key reason for manufacturing firms to continue manufacturing-either as normal or through manufacturing repurposing. Organizational flexibility may include actions such as setting up work at home capabilities, redesigning office and manufacturing space for social distancing, access to appropriate technology for remote working, and an expansion of sourcing portfolios. These are multiple levels of flexibility and are comprehensive. Robust flexibility may vary from sector to sector; and even industry to industry. Regulatory, compliance and emergency legislation factors may however affect such flexibility from sector to sector or even country to country.We identified that several manufacturers and service-sector providers were successful in weathering the pandemic crisis.

        <p>The uptake of digital technologies within manufacturing has become increasingly pervasive as manufacturers gradually move from a low-cost business model to one which is primarily premised on value. The President of a major aerospace manufacturing company in the US stated: "We need to trace supply chain visibility beyond the Tier 1 supply base and digital tools can provide traceability beyond Tier 1 to the entire supply network to understand supply side risk. The company also leveraged additive manufacturing to produce thousands of PPE products such as handsfree door openers and face shields for their employees and the medical community".The uptake of digital technologies within manufacturing has become increasingly pervasive as manufacturers gradually move from a low-cost business model to one which is primarily premised on value.

        <p>Our study shows that manufacturing firms with a high level of digitization-in production facilities and helping in employee skills-display higher resilience and adaptability than manufacturers with lower digital adoption. Accelerating the digital transformation of manufacturing can increase visibility of pivoting and collaboration opportunities, with investment in digital upskilling becoming a serious prerequisite.Our study shows that manufacturing firms with a high level of digitization-in production facilities and helping in employee skills-display higher resilience and adaptability than manufacturers with lower digital adoption.

        <p>Manufacturing firms who were able to make decisions much quicker were found to be more responsive during the pandemic. For example, commissioning new technologies quickly to enable both in-house and contract staff to work from home, were seen to have supported manufacturing processes more efficiently. For a particular manufacturer during the early stages of the pandemic growth, rapid decision-making enabled them to saturate their existing market and expand to new ones. Thus, the pandemic accelerated growth plans within their operating region.Manufacturing firms who were able to make decisions much quicker were found to be more responsive during the pandemic.

        <p>Practitioners must ensure the availability and development of the necessary information systems, rapid analytical capability, and protocols to enable a culture and structure of rapid, and delegated decisionmaking. This effort may require organizational change programs with substantial leadership drive, effort and resources to effect it.Practitioners must ensure the availability and development of the necessary information systems, rapid analytical capability, and protocols to enable a culture and structure of rapid, and delegated decisionmaking.

        <p>The lack of such planning has proved to be a lost opportunity for many organizations and may be explained by the attitude towards opportunity cost reduction in risk provisioning. The wisdom of strategic task production focus needs to be reexamined in light of lessons learned and the ability to flex production assets from a focused-factory to a reconfigurable factory. This capability should be considered as an important capital budgeting criterion.The lack of such planning has proved to be a lost opportunity for many organizations and may be explained by the attitude towards opportunity cost reduction in risk provisioning.

        <p>Industry 4.0 technologies that can enable such multipurpose and re-purpose manufacturing will require prioritization. Repurposing investments could also be considered long-term investments in potentially new product markets for potential long-term benefits.Industry 4.0 technologies that can enable such multipurpose and re-purpose manufacturing will require prioritization.

        <p>We identified similarities across industrial sectors in their response to the disruption; responses included operational changes as well as the changes in product line. Reflections from respondents within these organizations suggests that these changes and implementation were considered strictly within individual organizations. We propose benchmarking be effectively completed. This is the process of evaluation of organizational products, services and processes in relation to best practice [26]. The efficiency of this tool can be seen in the success of the VentilatorChallenge UK program. We propose a cross-industry benchmarking exercise given the similarities we observed across industrial sectors. Sharing and learning across industrial sectors is an important continuous improvement tool for manufacturing this pandemic; but also in other disruptive situations.We identified similarities across industrial sectors in their response to the disruption; responses included operational changes as well as the changes in product line.

        <p>Overall, there is promise in mitigating the immense pandemic crisis disruption in manufacturing. Some of the key enablers and barriers are introduced in this paper. While we offer recommendations to industry practitioners, we concede that the industry sectors are subject to external factors-such as national or regional policy, new or previously unseen shocks in the supply chain-which can change the internal processes of businesses. These geographical idiosyncratic situations are not captured fully in our recommendations. Further research should investigate related nuances associated with specific manufacturing sectors taking into account the caveats of implementation in the context of different countries and geographic regions.Overall, there is promise in mitigating the immense pandemic crisis disruption in manufacturing.

        <p>The lessons learned in this study set a baseline for future disruptions and occurrences. It is not clear if similar enablers and barriers will be observed, but we believe there will be significant commonalities with other disruptions. Building a flexible manufacturing environment that is resilient should mean managing with enablers and barriers in mind.The lessons learned in this study set a baseline for future disruptions and occurrences.
