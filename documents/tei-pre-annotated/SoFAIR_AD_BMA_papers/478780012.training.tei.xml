        <p>Examining the role of consumer satisfaction within mobile eco-systems: evidence from mobile banking servicesExamining the role of consumer satisfaction within mobile eco-systems: evidence from mobile banking services</p>
        <p>The financial sector has over the last ten years gone through a process of significant disruption, changing consumer behaviour, creating new technologies and providing customers with new products and services (Baptista &amp; Oliveira, 2016;Malaquias &amp; Hwang, 2016). As part of this change consumers have started to move towards e-banking to carry out common money transactions and account features. However, research suggests, especially in developing countries there are still issues around consumer satisfaction in relational to the utilisation of ebanking services within mobile eco-systems (Al-Otaibi, Aljohani, Hoque, &amp; Alotaibi, 2018;The financial sector has over the last ten years gone through a process of significant disruption, changing consumer behaviour, creating new technologies and providing customers with new products and services (Baptista &amp; Oliveira, 2016;Malaquias &amp; Hwang, 2016).

Thus, in this paper we investigate the mechanism of customer satisfaction enhancement in mobile banking (MB), focusing on the role of trust. This is primarily discussed within the context of mobile ecosystems. For clarity we define MB as the accessing of banking networks and conducting transactions and other banking services remotely via mobile phone devices (Tam &amp; Oliveira, 2016b). This we argue is a growing area of importance which has had little attention in the literature, we identify a significant gap where the majority of the research has focused on the adoption and behavioural intention towards MB (Alalwan, Dwivedi, &amp; Rana, 2017;Choudrie, Junior, McKenna, &amp; Richter, 2018;Oliveira, Faria, Thomas, &amp; Popovič, 2014) while very little research has been conducted in post-adoption behaviours such as satisfaction.Baabdullah, Alalwan, Rana, Kizgin, &amp; Patil, 2019;Sampaio, Ladeira, &amp; Santini, 2017;Tam &amp; Oliveira, 2016b).

        <p>Satisfaction has been widely accepted as a key measure of continuous use and success in the information systems and e-commerce contexts. A number of studies have used the information system success model (DeLone &amp; McLean, 2003) to investigate customer satisfaction with MB (Baabdullah, Alalwan, Rana, Kizgin, et al., 2019;Motiwalla, Albashrawi, &amp; Kartal, 2019;Tam &amp; Oliveira, 2016b). We intend to utilise this model and expand on the discussion on this area and consider the mediating impact of trust on customer satisfaction, this is a significant shift away from previous research which has a focus on trust as an independent variable or outcome. In addition, we add nuance to the research area by including task characteristics and structural assurance along with the quality factors in the model of DeLone and McLean (2003). This was done to include all aspects of customer trust and satisfaction building on the recommendations of Petter, DeLone, and McLean (2013) who proposes the need for including other multiple factors in the model. Our research suggests that trust fully mediates the relationships between (service quality and structural assurance), and customer satisfaction. From our research we also find that trust partially mediates the relationships between (system quality, information quality and task characteristics), and customer satisfaction. Our results make an important contribution to knowledge and enhance our understanding on the aspects of trust that need to be taken into account to enhance MB customer satisfaction.Satisfaction has been widely accepted as a key measure of continuous use and success in the information systems and e-commerce contexts.

        <p>Thus, in differentiating this paper from previous research we carry out the following; firstly we build on the DeLone and McLean (2003) advocating continuous resting and refinement by extending the range of factors supplementing with task characteristics and structural assurance (Malaquias &amp; Hwang, 2016;Zhou, 2012) alongside the three quality factors in the in the DeLone and McLean (2003) model. Secondly, we extend the research by including trust as a mediator, this provides a better understanding of customer satisfaction in MB satisfaction as an indicator of MB success. Thus, in this area of research we put forward number of contributions.Thus, in differentiating this paper from previous research we carry out the following; firstly we build on the DeLone and McLean (2003) advocating continuous resting and refinement by extending the range of factors supplementing with task characteristics and structural assurance (Malaquias &amp; Hwang, 2016;Zhou, 2012) alongside the three quality factors in the in the DeLone and McLean (2003) model.

        <p>In developing this paper, we structure it as follows, we start by discussing the study problem and providing context to the study. We then proceed to review the literature regarding trust and satisfaction within MB, we further explore the role of the (DeLone &amp; McLean, 2003) model within MB. We then present our hypotheses and outline our results from the data collection process, this allows the authors to discuss and provide some managerial implications, limitation and future research direction.In developing this paper, we structure it as follows, we start by discussing the study problem and providing context to the study.

        <p>Malaquias and Hwang (2016) view MB as a disruptive tool which has the potential to bring significant efficiency to traditional customer tasks, saving time, money and customer service time, freeing up resources to ensure the quality of their mobile service networks. In addition, the positioning of MB within mobile eco-systems specifically mobile devices can reduce the level of financial fees compared with other conventional banking channels (Baabdullah, Alalwan, Rana, Kizgin, et al., 2019). Thus, for many banks the movement towards specific services such as MB which sit within a wider mobile eco systems is a significant part of future growth strategy (Albashrawi, Kartal, Oztekin, &amp; Motiwalla, 2019). However, developing any such strategy requires significant investment with some researchers (Baabdullah, Alalwan, Rana, Kizgin, et al., 2019) suggesting that banks have invested funds of $115 Billion worldwide. What is clear from this investment is that banks only recoup costs based on continuous usage, so for many banks the incentive is to persuade consumers to utilise more of the online services. Hence, the challenge in building trust within MB is crucial for long term efficiency and strategy.Malaquias and Hwang (2016) view MB as a disruptive tool which has the potential to bring significant efficiency to traditional customer tasks, saving time, money and customer service time, freeing up resources to ensure the quality of their mobile service networks.

        <p>However, while there is data to suggest that MB adoption is widespread and commonplace, recent trends and statistics related to MB services suggest that MB customers tend to use limited services of MB which may result in view MB as unsatisfactory. This is summed quite nicely in the following manner:However, while there is data to suggest that MB adoption is widespread and commonplace, recent trends and statistics related to MB services suggest that MB customers tend to use limited services of MB which may result in view MB as unsatisfactory.

        <p>(index mundi, 2019b). Thus, in order to remain competitive and to increase efficiency many banks are implementing MB services as a key aspect of their organisational growth strategies (CBL, 2019). As part of this the Libyan Government and central bank of Libya have invested significant sums by investing in IT infrastructure and payment system that rely on mobile devices to stimulate adoption in this area. (CBL, 2019). Thus, this paper is the first of its kind to investigate the use of MB within a Libyan context and what influences usage of MB devices.(index mundi, 2019b).

        <p>Trust has been widely accepted as a key element in human social relationships (Liu, Zhou, Ding, Palomares, &amp; Herrera, 2019), and as a concept is a crucial component in influencing customer behaviour (Dang, Nguyen, &amp; Pervan, 2020). Past research has suggested that the development of trust in the online environment is a precarious event, difficult to obtain but easily lost (Santa, MacDonald, &amp; Ferrer, 2019;Stouthuysen, 2020). Thus, prior e-commerce literature has highlighted that trust positively affects customer behaviour in many ways (Guo, Bao, Stuart, &amp; Le-Nguyen, 2018;Lin, Wang, &amp; Hajli, 2019;Oliveira, Alhinho, Rita, &amp; Dhillon, 2017). Trust involves different perspectives and concepts and is underpinned by areas such as psychology, sociology, organisational behaviour, economics, strategy, marketing, decision making and information system (Mayer, Davis, &amp; Schoorman, 1995).Trust has been widely accepted as a key element in human social relationships (Liu, Zhou, Ding, Palomares, &amp; Herrera, 2019), and as a concept is a crucial component in influencing customer behaviour (Dang, Nguyen, &amp; Pervan, 2020).

        <p>In response to the literature and the detailed work around trust research in e-commerce, trust can be namely broken down into three key areas; personality-based trust, institutional-based trust and interpersonal-based trust (Mayer &amp; Davis, 1999;McKnight, Choudhury, &amp; Kacmar, 2002;Moorman, Deshpandé, &amp; Zaltman, 1993). In the first instance personality-based trust conceptualises trust as a belief that is constructed psychologically in the early development of individuals (Rotter &amp; Rotter, 1967). According to Mayer et al. (1995), individuals are different regarding their willingness to trust based on their characteristics. Therefore, it is challenging to predict certain behaviours relying on personality in the online business environment (Yousafzai, Pallister, &amp; Foxall, 2009). In the second instance institutional-based trust deals with the uncertainty associated with the exchange process (Yousafzai et al., 2009). As a concept this has been investigated in the online business environment, mainly e-finance services using structural assurance (Wang, Guan, Hou, Li, &amp; Zhou, 2019;Wingreen, Mazey, Baglione, &amp; Storholm, 2019;Yu, Li, Li, Zhao, &amp; Zhao, 2018). Structural assurance refers to the extent to which customers believe that institutional structures "like guarantees, regulations, promises, legal recourse, or other procedures are in place to promote success" (McKnight et al., 2002, p. 393). In the third instance interpersonal-based trust, is the common type of trust; it considers trust as a social relationship between a specific trustor and the trustee (Mayer et al., 1995). This is made up of three core constructs; ability, integrity and benevolence (Chari, Christodoulides, Presi, Wenhold, &amp; Casaletto, 2016;Choi &amp; Cho, 2019). While ability and integrity are more about the characteristics of the MB, Benevolence reflects the specific relationship between the bank and customers (Choudrie et al., 2018;Zhou, 2012).In response to the literature and the detailed work around trust research in e-commerce, trust can be namely broken down into three key areas; personality-based trust, institutional-based trust and interpersonal-based trust (Mayer &amp; Davis, 1999;McKnight, Choudhury, &amp; Kacmar, 2002;Moorman, Deshpandé, &amp; Zaltman, 1993).

        <p>Thus, based on our research we establish that the majority of trust studies in MB have focused on initial trust. Establishing initial trust in the adoption stage is rational, however as the popularity of MB increasers it is becoming increasingly necessary to shed light on trust impacts on customer behaviour in the post-adoption stage to evaluate the effectiveness of such systems.Thus, based on our research we establish that the majority of trust studies in MB have focused on initial trust.

        <p>A unique attribute of this paper is the application of the DeLone and McLean (2003) information systems success model within an online MB context. The key reason for such an approach is due to its flexible nature in mediating the role of trust in shaping customer satisfaction. The DeLone and McLean (2003) model seeks to provide an understanding of the quality dimensions on satisfaction and in turn the success of information systems. It was initially developed based on the mathematical theory of communication (Shannon &amp; Weaver, 1949), which argue that information systems success can be assessed at three different levels namely the technical, the semantic, and the effectiveness level. In suppleminting their model, DeLone and McLean (1992) also adopted the view of Mason (1978), who views the effectiveness of information systems as a series of events from antecedents to outcomes.A unique attribute of this paper is the application of the DeLone and McLean (2003) information systems success model within an online MB context.

        <p>In response to the criticisms that were raised by Pitt, Watson, and Kavan (1995) regarding the evaluating of services quality and by Seddon (1997) about the lack of theoretical clarity, DeLone and McLean (2003) updated their model to integrate services quality (Fig. 1). In the updated model, DeLone and McLean (2003) argue that while information and system quality the most important constructs to measure the success of an individual system, service quality is the most important factor to measure the overall success of information systems. In addition, the updated model combines individual and organisational impacts into the net benefits construct.In response to the criticisms that were raised by Pitt, Watson, and Kavan (1995) regarding the evaluating of services quality and by Seddon (1997) about the lack of theoretical clarity, DeLone and McLean (2003) updated their model to integrate services quality (Fig. 1).

        <p>Trust has long been considered as a Catalyst in shaping satisfying business relationships in the online environment, in particular, the e-commerce contexts (Cao, Yu, Liu, Gong, &amp; Adeel, 2018;Chen, Hsiao, &amp; Hsieh, 2019). Trust is about the expectation of a party regarding specific actions of another party and the risk associated with these actions (McKnight &amp; Chervany, 2001). Similarly, in the MB context, customers expect that the bank will provide them with convenient and proper services. Hence, if MB meets users' expectations, customers will tend to build their trust in the MB services (Malaquias &amp; Hwang, 2016). Developing trust in MB should lead to achieving a high level of customer satisfaction which is required to guarantee the success of such services (Baabdullah, Alalwan, Rana, Kizgin, et al., 2019;Tam &amp; Oliveira, 2016b). Hence, within an e-business setting, MB services can raise concerns of customers not only about the security issues associated with online transactions but also about the required ability, integrity and benevolence of such system. Thus, our paper considers all dimensions of overall trust that explain the mediating role of trust in shaping customer satisfaction. We argue that in the current MB literature, very few studies have investigated the impact of trust on customer satisfaction (Berraies, Ben Yahia, &amp; Hannachi, 2017;Lee &amp; Chung, 2009;Sharma &amp; Sharma, 2019). In addition, these studies have not fully developed a comprehensive conceptualisation of trust in MB and failed to fully develop discussion around the mediating impact of trust on customer satisfaction. Thus, through this research and based on our comprehensive literature we formulate the following hypothesis:Trust has long been considered as a Catalyst in shaping satisfying business relationships in the online environment, in particular, the e-commerce contexts (Cao, Yu, Liu, Gong, &amp; Adeel, 2018;Chen, Hsiao, &amp; Hsieh, 2019). Trust is about the expectation of a party regarding specific actions of another party and the risk associated with these actions (McKnight &amp; Chervany, 2001). Similarly, in the MB context, customers expect that the bank will provide them with convenient and proper services. Hence, if MB meets users' expectations, customers will tend to build their trust in the MB services (Malaquias &amp; Hwang, 2016). Developing trust in MB should lead to achieving a high level of customer satisfaction which is required to guarantee the success of such services (Baabdullah, Alalwan, Rana, Kizgin, et al., 2019;Tam &amp; Oliveira, 2016b).

        <p>DeLone and McLean (1992) explain the notion of system quality as to how individuals perceive the quality of the overall performance of a specific system. System quality is most important in the e-commerce context due to the anonymity of services providers (Choudrie et al., 2018). In this study and according to the discussion in section 3.1 regarding the conceptualisation of trust in the MB context, system quality measures the ability of MB. It is reasoning that, if customers perceive MB to be of high quality, for example, easy to use, easy to navigate and attractive, they will be likely to have high levels of trust in the bank's ability and will be willing to transact using such system (Choudrie et al., 2018). This view is supported by several prior studies who through their research argue that systems quality has a significant effect on customer satisfaction (Baabdullah, Alalwan, Rana, Kizgin, et al., 2019;Motiwalla et al., 2019;Tam &amp; Oliveira, 2017). Sharma and Sharma (2019) however found no relationship between the two variables. We add to the previous literature by investigating the mediating role of trust in the relationship between system quality and customer satisfaction, which has not been considered in the MB research. Therefore, we attempt to examine the following hypothesis:DeLone and McLean (1992) explain the notion of system quality as to how individuals perceive the quality of the overall performance of a specific system.

        <p>Information quality has been confirmed as one of the main factors that influences trust, satisfaction and use in an information systems and e-business context (Motiwalla et al., 2019;Oliveira et al., 2017).

        <p>Within a non-physical environment information quality plays an essential role in shaping the online experience of consumers, in many scenarios MB customers need to rely on their perceptions regarding the quality of the information generated from the MB system (Gao &amp; Waechter, 2017). Poor quality information can cause significant issues from a consumer perspective, poor, out-of-date, inaccurate and irrelevant information can raise concerns about the ability and integrity of MB resulting in a low level of customer trust (Zhou, 2011). This can result in a low level of customer trust in MB services. By extension, the lack of trust can lead to the failure in achieving a high level of customer satisfaction (Lee &amp; Chung, 2009;Sharma &amp; Sharma, 2019). Therefore, we argue that information quality affects customer trust and satisfaction. In the MB research, information quality has been investigated as an independent variable that influences customer trust, satisfaction and use (Lee &amp; Chung, 2009;Sharma &amp; Sharma, 2019;Tam &amp; Oliveira, 2017;Trabelsi-Zoghlami et al., 2018;Zhou, 2011Zhou, , 2012)).Within a non-physical environment information quality plays an essential role in shaping the online experience of consumers, in many scenarios MB customers need to rely on their perceptions regarding the quality of the information generated from the MB system (Gao &amp; Waechter, 2017).

        <p>However, from our research we found no clear studies that have considered the influence of information quality on customer satisfaction indirectly through trust.

        <p>As discussed in section 3.2, service quality was integrated into the updated information system success model (DeLone &amp; McLean, 2003) to measure the services provided by a specific system. Service quality evaluates the reliability, promptness, personalisation of the services, and whether the services are professional (Gefen, 2002). In the view of Choudrie et al. (2018), this component plays a significant role in customer quality within the context of MB. Thus, the development of service quality becomes a competitive driver in the investment of funds and strategies to enhance the quality of such services. Zhou (2013) argues that poor service quality through MB can cause poor customer trust and satisfaction. Research in the area has investigated the use of service quality as a measure of the overall quality of MB and its impact on initial trust and customer satisfaction (Gao &amp; Waechter, 2017;Sharma &amp; Sharma, 2019;Zhou, 2012). While this may be the case, we still argue that there is a gap in the MB research pertaining to the indirect effect of service quality on customer satisfaction through trust as a key predictor of satisfaction.

        <p>Design, function and usability can impact customer usage habits, behaviour and perceptions of products, services and technology (Choudrie et al., 2018). Technological adoption has the potential for positive impact on user performance if it is perceived as a useful tool which can provide convenience and ease of use as part of daily life (Tam &amp; Oliveira, 2019). Thus, new technology can lead to tasks being optimised in a manner which allows for efficiency, effectiveness and good user experience (Oliveira et al., 2014). According to Baabdullah, Alalwan, Rana, Kizgin, et al. (2019), task characteristics are the incentive that drives users to adopt a specific technological innovation. Hence, in the context of MB the potential for adoption in this area to drive innovation is huge, conducting normal everyday tasks such as money transfer, account inquires and account management are precursors for the build-up of trust (Malaquias &amp; Hwang, 2016). Research in this area suggests that MB services are viewed as "benevolent" activities which make the life of the consumer easier and more convenient (Baabdullah, Alalwan, Rana, Patil, et al., 2019;Tam &amp; Oliveira, 2016b). Thus, in this paper we argue that the task characteristic variable can be used to measure the benevolence of MB in accordance to our framework. Recent research has utilised task characteristics as a mechanism to predict customer behaviour in MB (Baabdullah, Alalwan, Rana, Patil, et al., 2019;Malaquias &amp; Hwang, 2016;Malaquias, Malaquias, &amp; Hwang, 2018). Where we find a gap is the investigation of the direct and indirect relationships between task characteristics and customer satisfaction.

        <p>For H6 we investigate structural assurance, widely used in studies as the main dimension for institutional-based trust. Research by Baptista and Oliveira (2016) has outlined structural assurance as a critical contributor towards the building of trust within the MB setting. In this context structural assurance is defined as technological and legal structures which are essential to ensure security (McKnight et al., 2002). This is a critical component within MB, the infrastructure is built on wireless networks and cellular data points and in the past, these have had the perception that they are vulnerable to hacker attacks or information interception. Thus, strong structural assurances such as SSL certification and government regulations are essential in ensuring security, acting as the foundation on which customers can build their trust in MB (Oliveira et al., 2014). Strong trust in the infrastructure can result in achieving a high level of customer satisfaction. This view has been confirmed by prior research which discusses the importance of structural assurance on user trust in MB (Baptista &amp; Oliveira, 2016;Oliveira et al., 2014;Zhou, 2012). Thus, in developing our study we argue that there have been very few studies which investigate the direct effect of structural assurance on customer satisfaction and indirect effect through the mediating impact of trust. Hence, this study argues that in the MB context structural assurance plays an integral role in enhancing customer satisfaction.

The Bristol online survey (BOS) was employed as an appropriate method for gathering large-scale data from different Libyan regions and banks (Epstein, Klinkenberg, Wiley, &amp; McKinley, 2001).

        <p>After the development of the questionnaire the research team conducted a pilot study to ensure there was no ambiguity in the questions, and to evaluate the time required for completion. The pilot study was also used as a mechanism to test the internal consistency of the research model using Cronbach alpha (Iacobucci &amp; Churchill, 2010). The pilot study was conducted over a period of one week in September 2018 where paper-based hardcopy versions of the questionnaire were distributed to participants. The random sample for the pilot study consisted of Libyan students who were studying in the UK and have used MB in Libya. A total of 22 students agreed to participate in the pilot, which is an adequate number to conduct a valuable pilot study (Isaac, Michael, Educational, &amp; Industrial Testing, 1995). 21 responses (15 male and 6 female) were returned.

However, sending an online survey by email or SMS requires a list of all the email addresses or mobile phone numbers of the potential respondents which are not possible to the nature of the study population and the data restriction by banks due to privacy and data protection laws. Therefore, social media platforms can be an appropriate channel to collect the data. Facebook is the most popular social media platform in Libya with 67.4% of the population having access to the platform (Statcounter, 2019). Thus, we decided to use this platform to distribute the survey. To facilitate this, we joined the 18 most popular banking communities to gain access to as many participants as possible, these communities were especially valuable as they included participants from all regions and banks.

This study used SEM with partial least squares (PLS), which is more appropriate for the prediction and exploratory of the structural relationships (Hair, Hult, Ringle, &amp; Sarstedt, 2017). PLS-SEM also provides a practical method to conduct mediation analysis and identify its level (full or partial mediation) (Sarstedt, Ringle, Smith, Reams, &amp; Hair, 2014). We used The

        <p>To validate the measurement model, we first examined the indicator (item) loadings to evaluate the indicator reliability. Second, the internal consistency reliability by testing the composite reliability (CR) and Cronbach's alpha. Third, assessing the convergent reliability of each construct to explain the variance of its items. The convergent validity was addressed using the average variance extracted (AVE) values for all indicators on each construct (Hair, Risher, Sarstedt, &amp; Ringle, 2019).To validate the measurement model, we first examined the indicator (item) loadings to evaluate the indicator reliability.

Third, assessing the convergent reliability of each construct to explain the variance of its items. The convergent validity was addressed using the average variance extracted (AVE) values for all indicators on each construct (Hair, Risher, Sarstedt, &amp; Ringle, 2019).</p>
        <p>As shown in table 3, the loadings of all items is above the acceptable level (0.70) (Sarstedt et al., 2014). This implies that the constructs explain more than 50 % of the indicators' variance (Hair et al., 2019). Also, all the composite reliability (CR) values are above 0.7, which is an indicator of adequate internal consistency reliability (Hair et al., 2017). The Cronbach's alpha values of all constructs are ranged from 0.787 to 0.914 which are higher than the acceptable threshold of the test (Nunally &amp; Bernstein, 1978). In addition, the AVE values ranged from 0.605 to 0.809, exceeding 0.5, which is the threshold recommended by (Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981). This means that each construct in the model interprets more than 50% of its items' variance (Hair et al., 2019). Regarding discriminant validity, two assessments are traditionally recommended for the purposes of estimation: while the Cross-loadings criterion deals with the indicator level, Fornell and Larcker criterion deals with the construct level (Hair et al., 2017). For the cross-loading criterion, table 4 depicts that the loadings of the measures on each assigned construct are higher than their loadings on all other constructs. This indicates that the items of a particular construct measure their construct, not other constructs (Chin, 1998). The second criterion is examining the Fornell and Larcker criterion. Table 5 exhibits that the square root of average variance extracted (AVE) of each construct have a greater value than the correlations with all the other constructs. This denotes that each construct explains better the variance of its own items than the variance of the other constructs (Hair, Sarstedt, Hopkins, &amp; G. Kuppelwieser, 2014). Despite the dominant use of the cross-loadings and Fornell-Larcker criteria to estimate the discriminant validity, recent investigation has found that both criteria are not reliable detectors of discriminant validity issues (Henseler, Ringle, &amp; Sarstedt, 2015). To deal with this insufficient detection of discriminant validity problems, Henseler et al. (2015) suggested a new approach for assessing discriminant validity namely heterotrait-monotrait ratio (HTMT) of the correlations. "(HTMT) is the mean of all correlations of indicators cross constructs measuring different constructs [......] relative to the (geometric) mean of the average correlations of indicators measuring the same construct" (Hair et al., 2017, p. 218). The acceptable threshold of the HTMT test is controversial. However, in general, the correlation values close to one indicates a lack of discriminant validity. The present research adopts the threshold proposed by (Henseler et al., 2015), which is 0.90. Table 6 shows that the calculation of the HTMT ratio for each pair of constructs yielded values between 0.402 regarding (information quality, task characteristics) and 0.838 regarding (satisfaction, trust). Thus, all HTMT ratios are lower than 0.90 which signifies that there are no discriminant validity problems according to this criterion.As shown in table 3, the loadings of all items is above the acceptable level (0.70) (Sarstedt et al., 2014). This implies that the constructs explain more than 50 % of the indicators' variance (Hair et al., 2019). Also, all the composite reliability (CR) values are above 0.7, which is an indicator of adequate internal consistency reliability (Hair et al., 2017). The Cronbach's alpha values of all constructs are ranged from 0.787 to 0.914 which are higher than the acceptable threshold of the test (Nunally &amp; Bernstein, 1978).

Despite the dominant use of the cross-loadings and Fornell-Larcker criteria to estimate the discriminant validity, recent investigation has found that both criteria are not reliable detectors of discriminant validity issues (Henseler, Ringle, &amp; Sarstedt, 2015). To deal with this insufficient detection of discriminant validity problems, Henseler et al. (2015) suggested a new approach for assessing discriminant validity namely heterotrait-monotrait ratio (HTMT) of the correlations. "(HTMT) is the mean of all correlations of indicators cross constructs measuring different constructs [......] relative to the (geometric) mean of the average correlations of indicators measuring the same construct" (Hair et al., 2017, p. 218). The acceptable threshold of the HTMT test is controversial. However, in general, the correlation values close to one indicates a lack of discriminant validity. The present research adopts the threshold proposed by (Henseler et al., 2015), which is 0.90. Table 6 shows that the calculation of the HTMT ratio for each pair of constructs yielded values between 0.402 regarding (information quality, task characteristics) and 0.838 regarding (satisfaction, trust). Thus, all HTMT ratios are lower than 0.90 which signifies that there are no discriminant validity problems according to this criterion.</p>

        <p>(2017) which comprises collinearity issues test, path coefficient, effect size (F 2 ), coefficient of determination (R 2 ), Prediction relevance (Q2) and the model's out-of-sample predictive power by using the PLS predict procedure (Hair et al., 2019). The first step is to ensure that there are no significant levels of collinearity among the predictor constructs which can create redundant in the analysis (Hair et al., 2019). When conducting the PLS algorithm procedure in 
            <rs type="software">SmartPLS</rs> (table 7), all the VIF values are between 1 and 2.5431 and below the threshold of the collinearity test which is 5 (Hair et al., 2017). This demonstrates that there is no significant indication of multicollinearity issues and proved that the path coefficients are not biased.
        </p>
        <p>Regarding the path coefficient, for the purpose of this paper, we examined the significance of the hypothesised relationship between trust and customer satisfaction using the Bootstrapping procedure in 
            <rs type="software">SmartPLS</rs> with 5000 subsamples (Hair et al., 2014). As depicted in table 10, H1 in the conceptual model is significantly supported. Also, table 7 shows the results of F 2 and R 2 . The last step in the assessment of the structural model is examining the predictive relevance of the structural model to measure the endogenous latent variables. We applied the blindfolding procedure in 
            <rs type="software">SmartPLS</rs> to calculate Q 2 values. As shown in table 7, Q2 values are above zero, which implies that the structural model has a high predictive ability (Hair et al., 2019). Our model demonstrated a high explanatory power and predictive ability of the in-sample model. However, it is essential to assess the out of sample predictive power "to mimic how the PLS model will eventually be used to predict a new observation" (Shmueli et al., 2019(Shmueli et al., , p. 2334)). Shmueli, Ray, Estrada, and Chatla (2016) developed a new and straightforward approach to assess the out-of-sample predictive power, namely PLS predict. To employ this technique, we used the guideline recommended by (Hair et al., 2019;Shmueli et al., 2019). We predict statistic (Shmueli et al., 2019). Table 8 shows that all Q 2 predict are above zero, which indicate that all the indicators of endogenous constructs outperform the naïve benchmark. The second step is to analyse the prediction errors by comparing the prediction statistics values (RMSE and MAE) from the PLS path model with the linear regression model (LM). The rule of thumb is the predictive power of a model depends on the outcomes of comparison (Shmueli et al., 2019). PLS-SEM &lt; LM for none of the indicators: lacks predictive power; PLS-SEM &lt; LM for a minority of the indicators: low predictive power; PLS-SEM &lt; LM for a majority of the indicators: medium predictive power; PLS-SEM &lt; LM for all indicators: high predictive power. Table 8 shows that the majority of indicators in the PLS-SEM path model yielded lower prediction errors comparing to the naïve LM benchmark. However, Shmueli et al. (2019) state that the focus should be on the key endogenous construct of the model rather interpreting all indicators of the endogenous constructs. Thus, our model has a high predictive power.

        <p>As mention, the first step in the mediation analysis is to test the indirect effects of the independent variables on customer satisfaction through trust. The second step is to test the direct effects between the independent variables and customer satisfaction to specify the mediation types. Thus, based on the criteria of Zhao et al.

In addition, trust is partially mediating the relationships between (System Quality, Information Quality and task characteristics), and customer satisfaction.As mention, the first step in the mediation analysis is to test the indirect effects of the independent variables on customer satisfaction through trust.

        <p>In this paper we aim to investigate the centrality of trust as a mediator between our identified five factors (system quality, information quality, service quality, structural assurance and task characteristics) and customer satisfaction. Our model explains a 67% of variation in trust and 64% of variation in customer satisfaction. In the view of Chin (1998) Through this paper we have identified two clear contributions to knowledge, in the first contribution we outline the role of trust and its impact on MB post-adoption customer behaviour. In our results we found that trust acts as a strong determinant of customer satisfaction and our findings add value to the area of literature where researchers seek to conceptualise and investigate the role of trust and satisfaction in MB services. From our exhaustive literature review we find that there are no studies that consider the mediating impact of trust on customer satisfaction (Lee &amp; Chung, 2009;Sharma &amp; Sharma, 2019;Susanto et al., 2016;Trabelsi-Zoghlami et al., 2018). Thakur (2014) did combine within these two factors but did no investigate the relationship between trust and satisfaction.In this paper we aim to investigate the centrality of trust as a mediator between our identified five factors (system quality, information quality, service quality, structural assurance and task characteristics) and customer satisfaction.

        <p>For our second contribution we investigate the indirect effects of MB quality factors, task characteristics and structural assurance on customer satisfaction through trust. In our research within H1, H2 and H3 it quickly became apparent that all the quality dimensions of MB have indirect effects on customer satisfaction through trust. These results consistent with the work of other researchers in this area who link system quality, information quality and services quality to trust (Gao &amp; Waechter, 2017;Lee &amp; Chung, 2009;Zhou, 2011Zhou, , 2012)). In addition to this Motiwalla et al. (2019) found that the three quality factors of MB have significant impacts on customer satisfaction while Sharma and Sharma ( 2019) confirmed the effects of information quality and service quality on MB customer satisfaction. Our work has built on this research and in developing the second contribution we considered the impact of the quality factors on customer satisfaction through the mediating impact of trust. When considering the mediating of trust, it is noteworthy that the strongest mediating impact of trust is associated with services quality. Trust has a full mediating impact on the relationship between services quality and customer satisfaction. The mediating effects of trust on the two other quality factors are partial (Complementary). These findings are inconsistent with the study of (Sharma &amp; Sharma, 2019), who found that information quality and service quality have direct impacts on satisfaction and system quality does not affect satisfaction.For our second contribution we investigate the indirect effects of MB quality factors, task characteristics and structural assurance on customer satisfaction through trust.

        <p>To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first that investigates the impact of task characteristics on customer satisfaction. The test of H4 revealed that task characteristics have a significant direct effect on customer satisfaction and also a significant indirect effect through trust. This result is in accordance with the study of (Malaquias &amp; Hwang, 2016) in supporting the positive relationship between task characteristics and trust. In addition, it emphasises the importance of MB for customers to perform their activities and also consistent with other studies regarding the influence of task characteristics in the adoption and usage of MB (Tam &amp; Oliveira, 2016b;Zhou, Lu, &amp; Wang, 2010). Finally, for the H5, the current study confirms that structural assurance is the most influential factor of trust. Earlier work has emphasised the importance of structural assurance in building trust in MB (Baptista &amp; Oliveira, 2016;Gu et al., 2009;Oliveira et al., 2014;Zhou, 2011Zhou, , 2012)). However, all these studies considered the role of structural assurance in developing initial trust in the pre-adoption stage. Our study considers the role of structural assurance in MB trust in the post-adoption stage, and in turn customer satisfaction. Our findings revealed that structural assurance has only an indirect impact on customer satisfaction via trust, demonstrating that structural assurance can also have a key influence on customer behaviour in the post-adoption stage.To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first that investigates the impact of task characteristics on customer satisfaction.

The measures used in this study can be also applied to survey MB customers discovering potential weaknesses and/or strengths in these factors. Dealing with this, can create competitive advantages for banks.The conceptual framework of this paper comprises the three MB quality dimensions, task characteristics and structural assurance and their influence on customer satisfaction.

        <p>This paper proved that trust mediates the relationship between system quality, information quality and services quality, and customer satisfaction. These results will provide high values to banks in making their MB system increasingly trusty and in turn, satisfactory. As trust is fundamental in e-finance in achieving customer satisfaction, MB should encourage customers to use such services continuously. We offer a guideline to enhance trust in MB. Our findings reveal that MB quality dimensions have substantial effects on trust. Thus, these dimensions should be considered in designing MB apps and their related services. This is important as high trust level will be translated to a high level of customer satisfaction influencing the success of MB. The improvement of MB system quality through ensuring convenient accessibility, improving ease of use and navigation and enhancing visual attractiveness, is expected to lead to higher user satisfaction directly and indirectly via trust. Information quality can be improved by paying attention to accuracy, completeness, relevance and timeliness of the information customer obtain from MB. Our findings reveal that high-quality information directly and indirectly via trust has a positive impact on customer satisfaction. In terms of overall quality of MB services, our findings show that service has a significant effect on customer satisfaction but only through trust. Hence, in order to reinforce customers' perception regarding the ability and integrity of their banks to offer quality MB services, banks must continuously assess service quality. This can be achieved by ensuring reliability, promptness, professionality and personalization of their MB services.

        <p>As mentioned, task characteristics has a significant direct and indirect effect on customer satisfaction. This proved the fact that customers need to feel that their banks behave in the interest of them by providing them with the required support to do their banking transactions through MB which can support them in performing their activities. Therefore, banks must ensure that customers can do banking convivially and properly. Finally, in addition to the important attention that should be paid to the characteristics of MB and supporting customers' activities, banks should reinforce feelings of security of their customers. This can be achieved by guaranteeing information protection and transactional confidentiality (Zhou, 2012). This is most important due to that MB is operated using wireless networks which can be perceived by customers as vulnerable to hacker attacks and information interception. Accomplishing this will enhance trust in MB, resulting in achieving high levels of customer satisfaction.As mentioned, task characteristics has a significant direct and indirect effect on customer satisfaction.
