        <p>Challenges such as climate change and resource depletion are deeply shaping society (Cagno, Negri, Neri, &amp; Giambone, 2023;Govindan &amp; Hasanagic, 2018), favouring the emergence of new needs and evolutionary trends in the industry (Kumar, Sezersan, Garza-Reyes, Gonzalez, &amp; AL-Shboul, 2019). Among them, Circular Economy (CE) and Industry 4.0 have emerged as crucial transitions that are currently under discussion among scholars, practitioners, and policymakers (Gupta, Kumar, &amp; Wasan, 2021). The CE concept entails a shift from the traditional linear production and consumption mode to a circular one, by closing the material loop to decrease material extraction and waste disposal (Moreno, Court, Wright, &amp; Charnley, 2019). It also replaces the 'end-of-life' concept with reducing, alternatively reusing, recycling, and recovering materials in production/distribution and consumption processes. CE principles can be addressed at different levels, namely micro (single firm), meso (industrial systems and networks) and macro (society or country) levels (Kirchherr, Reike, &amp; Hekkert, 2017). At the micro level, to foster the transition towards CE, firms have to rethink the logics through which they create, deliver, and capture value within their business model (Franzò, Urbinati, Chiaroni, &amp; The extant literature provides some indications of how DTs can support the circular transition by industrial SMEs, but efforts appear rare and scattered. In particular, valuable contributions only consider selected DTs or CE practices. However, for a proper understanding of the role that DTs can play in supporting the circular transition by industrial SMEs, there is the need to investigate such a relationship from an integrated and holistic perspective (Cagno et al., 2021), and, above all, from an empirical viewpoint (Awan, Sroufe, &amp; Shahbaz, 2021). This means that the investigation should encompass as many DTs and CE practices as possible, rather than focusing on a limited set of DTs or CE practices (holistic perspective), also considering the possible synergies among different DTs in supporting the circular transition (integrated perspective). Moreover, to the best of the authors' knowledge, contributions that empirically investigate the role of DTs in supporting the implementation of CE practices by industrial SMEs from both a holistic and integrated perspective are still lacking. Therefore, this study aims to contribute to this direction by answering the following research question:Challenges such as climate change and resource depletion are deeply shaping society (Cagno, Negri, Neri, &amp; Giambone, 2023;Govindan &amp; Hasanagic, 2018), favouring the emergence of new needs and evolutionary trends in the industry (Kumar, Sezersan, Garza-Reyes, Gonzalez, &amp; AL-Shboul, 2019).

        <p>To answer the research question, an exploratory empirical investigation involving ten Italian manufacturing SMEs has been carried out, through the conduction of semistructured interviews, which sheds light on the supporting role played by DTs in the implementation of CE practices by industrial SMEs, also providing preliminary evidence on the support offered by the concurrent adoption (i.e. integration) of different DTs for the circular transition. The remainder of the paper follows. A literature background for the study is offered (Section 2), along with the methods employed for the empirical analysis (Section 3). The results of the empirical analysis are then presented and extensively discussed against the extant literature (Section 4). Finally, conclusions as well as limitations and avenues for future research are offered in the last section (Section 5).To answer the research question, an exploratory empirical investigation involving ten Italian manufacturing SMEs has been carried out, through the conduction of semistructured interviews, which sheds light on the supporting role played by DTs in the implementation of CE practices by industrial SMEs, also providing preliminary evidence on the support offered by the concurrent adoption (i.e. integration) of different DTs for the circular transition.

        <p>DTs have emerged as an interesting tool, or even a pivotal one (Chauhan, Parida, &amp; Dhir, 2022), to enable the circular transition by industrial firms (Agrawal, Wankhede, Kumar, Luthra, &amp; Huisingh, 2022;Ciliberto, Szopik-Depczyńska, Tarczyńska-Łuniewska, Ruggieri, &amp; Ioppolo, 2021;Rusch, Schöggl, &amp; Baumgartner, 2022;Sahu, Agrawal, &amp; Kumar, 2022). The main benefits DTs can bring include (Wynn and Jones, 2022) increased transparency and visibility (Ivanov, Dolgui, &amp; Sokolov, 2022;Lu, Zhao, &amp; Liu, 2022), improved collection of data (Bag, Pretorius, Gupta, &amp; Dwivedi, 2021), increased efficiency in the use of resources (S. A. R. Khan, Ponce, et al., 2021;S. A. R. Khan, Umar, Asadov, Tanveer, &amp; Yu, 2022), enabling circular design (S. A. R. Khan, Piprani, &amp; Yu, 2022;Pinheiro, Jugend, Lopes de Sousa Jabbour, Chiappetta Jabbour, &amp; Latan, 2022), and servitisation (Atif et al., 2021). Accordingly, the relevance of DTs in supporting the circular transition by industrial firms has been proven in different sectors, such as electronic equipment (Magrini et al., 2021;Pinheiro et al., 2022), electric motors (Tiwari, Miscandlon, Tiwari, &amp; Jewell, 2021), waste management (Mastos et al., 2021), and construction (Elghaish et al., 2022).DTs have emerged as an interesting tool, or even a pivotal one (Chauhan, Parida, &amp; Dhir, 2022), to enable the circular transition by industrial firms (Agrawal, Wankhede, Kumar, Luthra, &amp; Huisingh, 2022;Ciliberto, Szopik-Depczyńska, Tarczyńska-Łuniewska, Ruggieri, &amp; Ioppolo, 2021;Rusch, Schöggl, &amp; Baumgartner, 2022;Sahu, Agrawal, &amp; Kumar, 2022).

        <p>However, the current debate on the topic is characterised by the fact that both DTs and CE practices are addressed from a general perspective, i.e. without detail on specific DTs or CE practices (Hettiarachchi, Seuring, &amp; Brandenburg, 2022;Lei, Cai, Cui, Wu, &amp; Liu, 2022;Taddei, Sassanelli, Rosa, &amp; Terzi, 2022). Interestingly, efforts considering the specificity of DTs or CE practices are present and are increasing in number, yet they mainly focus on selected DTs or CE practices (Bressanelli, Adrodegari, Pigosso, &amp; Parida, 2022;Ertz et al., 2022;Gebhardt et al., 2022;Patyal et al., 2022;Rusch et al., 2022).However, the current debate on the topic is characterised by the fact that both DTs and CE practices are addressed from a general perspective, i.e. without detail on specific DTs or CE practices (Hettiarachchi, Seuring, &amp; Brandenburg, 2022;Lei, Cai, Cui, Wu, &amp; Liu, 2022;Taddei, Sassanelli, Rosa, &amp; Terzi, 2022).

        <p>2.1.1. The role of specific digital technologies in supporting the implementation of circular economy practices Deepening the discussion on the role of DTs in supporting the circular transition, interesting insights can be grasped by focusing on the support offered by specific DTs. IoT is one of the most widely adopted DTs to enable the circular transition by firms, given the many opportunities it offers by allowing the interaction, cooperation, collection, and exchange of data through wireless telecommunications (Rejeb et al., 2022;Rusch et al., 2022). IoT can support different CE strategies (Laskurain-Iturbe et al., 2021;Massaro et al., 2021;Trevisan, Zacharias, Castro, &amp; Mascarenhas, 2021), such as a reduction of resources consumption (Awan, Sroufe, et al., 2021;Lopes de Sousa Jabbour, Frascareli, Santibanez Gonzalez, &amp; Chiappetta Jabbour, 2021). IoT is also acknowledged to help raise industrial firms' awareness of circular opportunities, e.g. in the textile sector (Ghoreishi &amp; Happonen, 2022), also thanks to the enabled connection among different stakeholders (de Oliveira Neto, da Conceição Silva, &amp; Filho, 2022;Rizvi, Agrawal, &amp; Murtaza, 2021). BDA can facilitate and support the decision-making process in a circular perspective (Spaltini, Poletti, Acerbi, &amp; Taisch, 2021;Voulgaridis, Lagkas, Angelopoulos, &amp; Nikoletseas, 2022), thanks to the provided data-driven insights (Awan, Shamim, et al., 2021). Such insights have been connected to the possibility of performing remanufacturing and disassembly activities in a more efficient manner (Agrawal et al., 2022), as well as reuse and recycling (Hallioui, Herrou, Santos, Katina, &amp; Egbue, 2022), also fostering resource efficiency (Hettiarachchi, Seuring, et al., 2022;Laskurain-Iturbe et al., 2021). Cybersecurity and Blockchain (CYB) are of interest for the circular transition due to their ability to assure transparency as well as the protection of the cyber environment, which may foster internal and external communication that allows collaboration among different stakeholders within industrial systems (Bekrar, Cadi, Todosijevic, &amp; Sarkis, 2021;Chauhan et al., 2022;Mastos et al., 2021;Nandi, Sarkis, Hervani, &amp; Helms, 2021). This ability has been empirically proved, for example in the automotive sector (Rizvi, Agrawal, &amp; Murtaza, 2022). Moreover, CYB can support circular purchasing and design (S. A. R. Khan, Razzaq, Yu, &amp; Miller, 2021;S. A. R. Khan, Zia-ul-haq, Umar, &amp; Yu, 2021), as well as waste management (Upadhyay et al., 2021) and material recovery, refurbishing, and recycling activities (Hallioui et al., 2022;Hennemann Hilario da Silva &amp; Sehnem, 2022). AM and especially 3D printing are considered strong enablers for the circular transition (Hettiarachchi, Brandenburg, &amp; Seuring, 2022b), due to their ability to build parts with geometrical and material complexity, not feasible with traditional manufacturing processes (Garza-Reyes, Salomé Valls, Peter Nadeem, Anosike, &amp; Kumar, 2019). AM can be adopted at different stages of the supply chain (Patyal et al., 2022;Ponis, Aretoulaki, Maroutas, Plakas, &amp; Dimogiorgi, 2021;Tavares-Lehmann &amp; Varum, 2021) and it helps reduce waste (Burmaoglu, Ozdemir Gungor, Kirbac, &amp; Saritas, 2022) and favour the use of recovered materials instead of virgin raw materials (de Mattos Nascimento et al., 2022;Kayikci, Gozacan-Chase, Rejeb, &amp; Mathiyazhagan, 2022). Artificial Intelligence (AI) is often connected to the identification of new routes for CE activities and increased process quality (Chauhan et al., 2022), thanks to the offered predictions based on data analysis (S. A. R. Khan, Piprani, et al., 2022;Rizvi et al., 2021). Specifically, AI can support circular design (Awan, Sroufe, &amp; Bozan, 2022;Kayikci, Gozacan-Chase, et al., 2022) and procurement (Hallioui et al., 2022), as well as resource efficiency (Laskurain-Iturbe et al., 2021), waste management (Hennemann Hilario da Silva &amp; Sehnem, 2022;Talla &amp; McIlwaine, 2022) and reverse logistics (Wilson et al., 2022). Simulation (SIM) shows potential for tracing and predicting the material flow along the supply chain (Tiwari et al., 2021) and it is considered crucial for disassembly activities (Sassanelli, Rosa, &amp; Terzi, 2021). Automated Robots (ROBs), which help with the automation of the production process (Kamble &amp; Gunasekaran, 2021), are mainly associated to disassembly (Kayikci, Gozacan-Chase, et al., 2022;Kintscher, Lawrenz, &amp; Poschmann, 2021) and repairing activities (Wynn &amp; Jones, 2022), with insights from different industries (Tiwari et al., 2021;Trevisan, Zacharias, Liu, Yang, &amp; Mascarenhas, 2021). Additionally, evidence proved the suitability of ROBs for activities related to recovery and recycling strategies (Laskurain-Iturbe et al., 2021;Lopes de Sousa Jabbour, Chiappetta Jabbour, Choi, &amp; Latan, 2022). Augmented Reality (AR)by providing an interactive computer simulation, can support the virtualisation strategy promoted within the ReSOLVE Framework (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2015) for CE (Bressanelli et al., 2022) and disassembly (Kayikci, Kazancoglu, Gozacan-Chase, Lafci, &amp; Batista, 2022). Horizontal and Vertical Systems Integration (HVSYS) can facilitate access to data (Hirota et al., 2022;Trevisan, Zacharias, Castro, et al., 2021), particularly allowing collaboration among different stakeholders (Awan et al., 2022;del Vecchio, Passiante, Barberio, &amp; Innella, 2021;S. A. Khan, Laalaoui, Hokal, Tareq, &amp; Ahmad, 2022). This offers great opportunities for recycling activities and the redesign of products and processes (Oyinlola et al., 2022). Finally, Cloud computing (CLOUD) allows the storage and sharing of data between stakeholders along the supply chain (Godinho Filho, Monteiro, de Oliveira Mota, dos Santos Leite Gonella, &amp; de Souza Campos, 2022). Specifically, CLOUD shows great potential in different industries to promote collaboration (Gebhardt et al., 2022), whereas no specific CE practices enabled by this DT have been discussed within the extant literature.2.1.1.

        <p>2.1.2. The integration of digital technologies in supporting the implementation of circular economy practices Despite the discussion on the topic has been mainly focused on single DTs at a time, the scholarly debate is nonetheless starting to address digital ecosystems, i.e. the integration of different DTs to support the implementation of CE practices (Ertz et al., 2022), which are associated to different benefits (Rusch et al., 2022).2.1.2.

        <p>Most of the contributions focus on the integration between IoT and other DTs, as the ability of IoT of collecting and exchanging data is recognised as the basis for the adoption of other DTs (Schöggl, Rusch, Stumpf, &amp; Baumgartner, 2023). As a way of example, Agrawal et al. (2022) suggest that coupling IoT and AI can lead to improved manufacturing performance and better analysis of product usage, leading to optimised disassembly and remanufacturing processes (Järvenpää, Salminen, &amp; Kantola, 2021;Spaltini et al., 2021). Moreover, when coupled with IoT and AI, BDA can support data analysis and the identification of possible improvements for CE (Bag, Pretorius, et al., 2021;Liu, Trevisan, Yang, &amp; Mascarenhas, 2022). IoT, AI, and SIM can support the traceability of products and materials along the supply chain. Positive effects for traceability can be also obtained by concurrently adopting IoT, CYB, and HVSYS (de Oliveira Neto et al., 2022;Huynh, 2022;Marini et al., 2021). CYB can ensure the safety of the use of other DTs (Caterino, Fera, Macchiaroli, &amp; Pham, 2022;Ivanov et al., 2022), such as IoT or AM (Laskurain-Iturbe et al., 2021;Upadhyay et al., 2021). Furthermore, the integration of ROB and AI has been perceived as particularly beneficial for recycling activities (Elghaish et al., 2022). Moreover, AM, BDA, IoT, AI, and ROBs can work synergically for improved efficiency of activities and processes. As a way of example, they can collect and analyse real-time data supporting the decision-making process (Ghoreishi &amp; Happonen, 2022;Patyal et al., 2022).Most of the contributions focus on the integration between IoT and other DTs, as the ability of IoT of collecting and exchanging data is recognised as the basis for the adoption of other DTs (Schöggl, Rusch, Stumpf, &amp; Baumgartner, 2023).

        <p>The adoption of DTs, and especially the integration of different DTs, might prove challenging for industrial SMEs (Lei et al., 2022), as they are usually characterised by a limited availability of resources (Micheli et al., 2021) such as financial resources and managerial competences. This might lead SMEs to adopt fewer DTs than larger firms (Aldrighetti, Battini, Das, &amp; Simonetto, 2022;Schöggl, Rusch, Stumpf, &amp; Baumgartner, 2023). Given the industrial SMEs' relevance in the overall industrial economy from economic, environmental, and social viewpoints (e.g. in the European economy) (Chatzistamoulou &amp; Tyllianakis, 2022;Journeault, Perron, &amp; Vallières, 2021) as well as their idiosyncratic characteristics (Cagno et al., 2023;Negri, Neri, Cagno, &amp; Monfardini, 2021), relevant contributions address the relationship between DTs and CE practices by these firms. For example, Bressanelli et al. (2018aBressanelli et al. ( , 2018b) ) analyse the coupled adoption of IoT and BDA supporting the development of servitised business models, such as Product-Service Systems. They find that IoT and BDA can also help overcome specific challenges, such as operational risks, technology improvements, and return flow uncertainty, yet recognising the limited generalisability of the results based on a single case study in the household appliances sector in Italy. De Marchi and di Maria (2020) consider a larger set of DTs while focusing on the support they offer to Italian SMEs for implementing resource efficiency and recycling CE strategies. As they underline the role of DTs as enablers for CE, they do recommend understanding the specific role played by each DT. Chaudhuri et al. (2022) discuss the support that CYB and AM can offer to SMEs involved in recycling plastic waste, particularly addressing the processes of sorting and managing such waste, underlying the necessity to tailor the two DTs to each specific SME's features. The contribution also provides insights into the business transformations required to properly exploit DTs for the circular transition, yet it appears limited due to the number of DTs and CE practices being considered. Di Maria et al. (2022) address both DTs and CE practices from a general perspective. Indeed, they mainly focus on recycling practices and the reduction of resource consumption but consider the empirical results obtained from an aggregated viewpoint. Attention is nonetheless drawn to the role of supply chain integration in mediating the relationship between DTs and CE practices.The adoption of DTs, and especially the integration of different DTs, might prove challenging for industrial SMEs (Lei et al., 2022), as they are usually characterised by a limited availability of resources (Micheli et al., 2021) such as financial resources and managerial competences.

        <p>Although the discussion over the relationship between DTs and CE practices is getting momentum, several gaps can be identified within the extant literature. On the one hand, many studies address the two concepts of DTs and CE practices from a general perspective, thus neither underlying nor investigating the peculiarities of different DTs and CE practices; on the other hand, many studies only focus on selected DTs or CE practices, thus missing a comprehensive perspective on the topic (Cagno et al., 2021). A more holistic perspective on the relationship is thus needed (Lei et al., 2022), considering not only a large set of DTs and CE practices but also the possible integration (i.e. synergies) among DTs in supporting the implementation of CE practices (de Felice &amp; Petrillo, 2021;Ertz et al., 2022;Trevisan, Zacharias, Castro, et al., 2021). Furthermore, apart from specific notably valuable contributions (e.g. de Mattos Nascimento et al., 2022;Tang, Chau, Fatima, &amp; Waqas, 2022), the debate is still mainly carried out at a theoretical and conceptual level, thus lacking an empirical analysis of the relationships between DTs and CE practices. For this reason, empirical applications and validations of the proposed relationships between the two have been called out (Bekrar et al., 2021;Ghoreishi &amp; Happonen, 2022;Taddei et al., 2022). Among the possible research methods, previous literature underlines the strategic role of qualitative research, such as semi-structured interviews or case studies (Aldrighetti et al., 2022;Cagno et al., 2021). On top of this, despite their relevance in the industrial context, the investigation of the relationship between DTs and CE practices in supporting circular transition by industrial SMEs has been only partially addressed so far, and considerable room for further development remains (Cagno et al., 2021).Although the discussion over the relationship between DTs and CE practices is getting momentum, several gaps can be identified within the extant literature.

        <p>To tackle the abovementioned gaps and provide empirical evidence on the role that DTs can play in supporting the implementation of CE practices by industrial SMEs, we performed an explorative empirical investigation that relied on the conduction of semistructured interviews, complemented by the collection of secondary data. Semi-structured interviews are an appropriate method for complementing extant knowledge when the related empirical literature seems fragmented (Cagno et al., 2023;Kallio, Pietilä, Johnson, &amp; Kangasniemi, 2016). Semi-structured interviews are indeed the right method to embrace to shed preliminary and exploratory light on a limited addressed topic (Cotta, Klink, Alten, &amp; al Madhoon, 2022;Negri, Cagno, &amp; Colicchia, 2022). Moreover, they allow asking immediate follow-up questions when issues arise (Adams, 2015), thus benefitting from the emerging free dialogue (Dicicco-Bloom &amp; Crabtree, 2006).To tackle the abovementioned gaps and provide empirical evidence on the role that DTs can play in supporting the implementation of CE practices by industrial SMEs, we performed an explorative empirical investigation that relied on the conduction of semistructured interviews, complemented by the collection of secondary data.

        <p>To select firms to be involved in the empirical analysis, we adopted purposive sampling (Acharya, Prakash, Saxena, &amp; Nigam, 2013;Hibberts, Johnson, &amp; Hudson, 2012). In particular, we designed a heterogeneous sample in terms of industrial sectors (manufacturing ones) (Trianni, Cagno, Neri, &amp; Howard, 2019), with the intention of improving external validity and the robustness of the results (Baškarada, 2014), as detailed in the following. The manufacturing sector plays a central role in the European industrial sector and economy (Eurostat, 2020); moreover, it has crucial repercussions for environmental impacts, also leading the way in the circular transition (Zamfir, Mocanu, &amp; Grigorescu, 2017). In this domain, SMEs are key contributors to European economic growth, innovation, job creation, and social integration (Eurostat, 2018), representing more than 99% of firms in Europe (European Commission, 2019;OECD, 2022). SMEs are commonly identified in the European context as firms with less than 250 employees and an annual turnover not exceeding 50 million euros (European Union, 2003). These firms have a significant environmental impact, with considerable room for improvement (Marrucci, Iannone, Daddi, &amp; Iraldo, 2022;Sáez-Martínez, Díaz-García, &amp; González-Moreno, 2016). We specifically focused on Italian manufacturing SMEs. Italy ranks first for the circularity index implementation among the main European economies (Circular Economy Network &amp; ENEA, 2020) and plays an increasingly relevant role in the European panorama regarding the digitalisation level (European Commission, 2022). The Italian manufacturing sector shows encouraging and interesting steps toward both CE and DTs adoption (Ghisellini &amp; Ulgiati, 2020;Zangiacomi, Pessot, Fornasiero, Bertetti, &amp; Sacco, 2020), as also demonstrated by the interest accrued in the extant debate (di Maria et al., 2022;Roos Lindgreen, Salomone, &amp; Reyes, 2020;Tiscini, Martiniello, &amp; Lombardi, 2022). We identified possible firms to be included in the empirical analysis through the AIDA database (https://aida.bvdinfo.com/), also pre-screening them by looking at secondary information on their CE and digital-related strategies or activities in place. Firms were then contacted by e-mail or phone, asking for their willingness to voluntarily take part in the research. All in all, ten Italian manufacturing SMEs have been selected, whose main characteristics are summarised in Table 1 (while additional information on such firms is available in Appendix A).To select firms to be involved in the empirical analysis, we adopted purposive sampling (Acharya, Prakash, Saxena, &amp; Nigam, 2013;Hibberts, Johnson, &amp; Hudson, 2012).

The number of conducted interviews is in line with previous works adopting the same methodology (Villamil &amp; Hallstedt, 2021;von Kolpinski, Yazan, &amp; Fraccascia, 2022). Each interview lasted approximately one hour and was conducted in person when allowed by each firm, due to the Covid-19 emergencysee details in Table 1.

        <p>The structure of the interview guide is aligned with previous research adopting semistructured interviews as the research method (Cagno et al., 2023;von Kolpinski et al., 2022). In particular, the interview guide includes four parts, also following the indication provided by DeJonckheere &amp; Vaughn (2019). The first part focuses on a general description of the firm, products, and processes. The second part concentrates on CE, where interviewees were asked to provide an understanding of CE and an overview of the CE practices implemented by their firms, recalling the implementation process, and providing an indication of each practice's implementation level (Q. Zhu, Sarkis, &amp; Lai, 2008). For the indication of the level of implementation, we relied on the following 4-point Likert-like scale: 1: We are currently evaluating its implementation; 2: We are currently implementing it; 3: We have implemented it for less than 3 years; 4: We have implemented it for more than 3 years. The respondents were then asked to elaborate on the identified level. The third part focuses on DTs. Interviewees were asked to provide an understanding of DTs and an overview of the DTs adopted by their firms, recalling the adoption process, and providing an indication of each DT's use level. For the indication of the level of use, we relied on the following 4-point Likert-like scale: 1: We are currently evaluating its adoption; 2: We are currently adopting it; 3: We are starting using it; 4: We use it in an advanced manner. The respondents were then asked to elaborate on the identified level. The fourth and last part is centred on the relationship between DTs and CE practices. We asked the respondents whether each of the adopted and used DTs was of any support in the implementation of each CE practice previously discussed, and to what extent. For the indication of the level of support offered, we relied on the following 4-point Likert-like scale: 1: From no to very limited support; 2: Quite significant support that nonetheless did not completely change the implementation process and/or outcome of the CE practice; 3: Significant but not pivotal support that changed the implementation process and/or outcome of the CE practice; 4: Pivotal support for the implementation process and/or outcome of the CE practice. The respondents were then asked to elaborate on the identified level. Finally, secondary data and field notes were used to integrate and corroborate primary data collected through the interviews (Cannas, Gosling, Pero, &amp; Rossi, 2019;Silva, Rodrigues, &amp; Ferreira Alves, 2022).

        <p>As far as data analysis is concerned, interviews were recorded (upon interviewees' agreement) and transcribed (Kohlbacher, 2006). They were subsequently manually coded together with field notes and secondary data. We first applied open coding, with themes emerging inductively from the data and enabling the identification of main aspects and general contents. The coding was performed by at least three different researchers independently, reducing bias. To have a common reference for the categorisation of CE practices and DTs (Trianni et al., 2019), we compared our inductive open coding with a coding system developed based on the extant literature, trying to find a conciliation with literature concepts (Neri, Cagno, &amp; Trianni, 2021;Silva, Pereira, &amp; Gold, 2018).As far as data analysis is concerned, interviews were recorded (upon interviewees' agreement) and transcribed (Kohlbacher, 2006).

        <p>Concerning CE practices, we referred to the list of micro level (internal and external) practices for SMEs offered by Garza-Reyes et al. ( 2019). As for DT, we referred to the classification by Rüßmann et al. ( 2015) and to the descriptions by Cagno et al. (2021). These classifications (which are reported in Appendix C) were used as a reference model for the analysis and discussion of the obtained results, considering their straightforwardness and ease of applicability in the industrial SMEs' context. Following the suggestions by Adams (2015) and Meredith (1998), results related to CE practices implemented, DTs adopted, as well as the relationship between the two, were analysed by considering their frequency and reported using graphs and supplemented by illustrative examples. The choice is in line with previous works adopting semi-structured interviews as the research method, and it is an interesting approach to allow grasping a snapshot of the overall results (Fallahi et al., 2022;Julkovski et al., 2022;Neri, Cagno, &amp; Trianni, 2021).Concerning CE practices, we referred to the list of micro level (internal and external) practices for SMEs offered by Garza-Reyes et al.

        <p>An overview of the CE practices implemented by the investigated SMEs, together with their level of implementation, is shown in Figure 1 (for a more detailed view, please refer to Appendix D). Interestingly, all the investigated firms have implemented at least one CE practice, but none of them has implemented all the CE practices suggested by Garza-Reyes et al. (2019). Furthermore, some CE practices have been very poorly implemented by the sampled firms, especially those related to external practices for longevity (category 'E' in Figure 1). As far as implemented CE practices are concerned, the average level of implementation is equal to 2.7, with most of the SMEs that have implemented such practices for less than 3 years (i.e. level 3), or are still in the implementation process (i.e. level 2). Results overall underline that efforts towards the circular transition by SMEs mainly address internal practices for resource efficiency (category 'A' in Figure 1), thus confirming Mura et al. (2020) and Nudurupati et al. (2022), but also in line with other studies that are not focused on SMEs (Elia, Gnoni, &amp; Tornese, 2020;Masi et al., 2018). As proof, the Sustainability Manager from Firm 1 stated:An overview of the CE practices implemented by the investigated SMEs, together with their level of implementation, is shown in Figure 1 (for a more detailed view, please refer to Appendix D).

        <p>Among the internal practices, the most frequently implemented ones refer to reducing resources, energy consumption, and waste, as well as green packaging and distribution, thus corroborating previous research (Guerra et al., 2021;Stumpf, Schöggl, &amp; Baumgartner, 2021).Among the internal practices, the most frequently implemented ones refer to reducing resources, energy consumption, and waste, as well as green packaging and distribution, thus corroborating previous research (Guerra et al., 2021;Stumpf, Schöggl, &amp; Baumgartner, 2021).</p>

(2022) for the implementation of resource efficiency practices by SMEs. These practices are perceived by the sampled firms as bringing economic advantages, as stated for example by Firm 4's CEO:Reducing resources and waste is also characterised by a relatively high level of implementation, in line with Antonioli et al.

        <p>Also, practices related to internal awareness (category 'B' in Figure 1) show quite an interesting rate of implementation, especially for the conduction of auditing and continuous monitoring, supporting Kamble &amp; Gunasekaran (2021) and Q. Zhu et al. (2010). Conversely, external practices, which require the involvement of stakeholders beyond a firm's boundaries (Antonioli et al., 2022) through collaborations along the supply chain (Negri et al., 2021;Neri, Cagno, Lepri, &amp; Trianni, 2021), seem less implemented, in line with Calzolari et al. (2021). Moreover, such practices are characterised by a lower level of implementation compared to internal practices for resource efficiency. Nonetheless, half of the investigated firms particularly focus on the selection of suppliers by using environmental criteria, in line with Nudurupati et al. (2022), although this can be biased due to the number of textile firms included in the investigated sample (Saha, Dey, &amp; Papagiannaki, 2021). Similarly, although the same number of firms claimed to collaborate with external partners on circular solutions and to promote joint initiatives with other firms by establishing eco-industrial chains, most of them are still predominantly implementing linear business models, as shown by the limited number of CE practices being implemented.Also, practices related to internal awareness (category 'B' in Figure 1) show quite an interesting rate of implementation, especially for the conduction of auditing and continuous monitoring, supporting Kamble &amp; Gunasekaran (2021) and Q. Zhu et al. (2010).

        <p>ROBs are not largely adopted, contrasting Zheng et al. (2020) but supporting Cimini et al. (2021), whereas firms adopting them show a medium-high level of use. AM and SIM show an even lower adoption by the sampled firms, while their relatively high level of use seems to be driven by a specific activity carried out by related firms, such as using moulds within the production process (Firm 1) or the management of logistics activities (Firm 2). Finally, CBY and AR show very limited or even no use. The result is consistent with previous literature (Cimini et al., 2021;Toufaily, Zalan, &amp; Dhaou, 2021;Zheng et al., 2020), and it might underline the presence of significant challenges in the adoption of these DTs. A considerable relationship seems to emerge between some DTs and CE internal practices for resource efficiency (Category 'A'), while it appears to be very sporadic for the other CE practices. Overall, specific DTs (i.e. ROBs, AM, BDA, SIM, and CLOUD) seem to support only internal practices, while others (i.e., HVSYS, CYB, and IoT) extend their backing to external practices, although to a limited extent. These results confirm previous research from various standpoints. First, DTs show a strong potential to reduce the material loop by enabling more efficient use of resources (De Marchi &amp; Di Maria, 2020), by acting on internal processes (Rajput &amp; Singh, 2021). From this perspective, the role of automated control, computing, and connecting technologies is fundamental (Kamble &amp; Gunasekaran, 2021;Lorenz, Benninghaus, Friedli, &amp; Netland, 2020;Marcon et al., 2022).

        <p>IoT. IoT is adopted in different ways and with different aims, underlining its versatility (Atzori, Iera, &amp; Morabito, 2017). In particular, the most widespread adoption that emerges from the empirical investigation, consistent with the extant literature (Kamble &amp; Gunasekaran, 2021), refers to the use of interconnected sensors for collecting and communicating real-time production and process-related data. These data can help support the monitoring of working environment parameters, such as humidity (Firm 7), temperature (Firm 8) or air emissions (Firm 3), also tracking the product over the supply chain (Firm 1). Bringing the example of Firm 8, the owner stated: 'These sensors are instrumental for measuring process parameters, which must be constant over time.'IoT.

        <p>CLOUD. Despite CLOUD being the most widespread DT among the sampled firms -also providing the infrastructure to support the adoption of other DTs, as discussed in Section 4.3.2. -, a very limited role of this DT in supporting the implementation of CE practices emerges from the empirical investigation, consistent with previous studies that have not tackled this specific relationship. In particular, CLOUD helps raise firms' internal awareness of their performance, thus facilitating the process of obtaining certifications (Firm 4) or setting environmental targets (Firm 6). Indeed, CLOUD makes data always accessible from any place, allowing prompt resolution of possible issues, and constant alignment with internal goals and targets. CYB. CYB is exploited by the sampled firms to a very limited extent, as only one firm (Firm 1) adopts it, with a twofold aim. On the one hand, it helps exchange product information with final customers, thus increasing their knowledge of the production process, yet not focusing on specific environmental or sustainable-related information. On the other hand, it helps control the different production stages over the supply chain to spot possible quality problems, to identify the faulty batch without the need to extensively check or eliminate all the production. The empirical evidence does not support previous studies addressing CYB, which show that it is crucial for product traceability and recycling (Huynh, 2022). Moreover, it is acknowledged as an enabler for the adoption of CE practices at the meso level by facilitating data sharing among the stakeholders along the supply chain and reflecting in different adoption rates (Pirola et al., 2020). The results of the empirical investigation support this argument and will be thus discussed for Vertical Systems Integration (VSI) and Horizontal Systems Integration (HSI) in a separate manner. VSI is fairly widespread among the sampled firms. It allows better control of productionrelated issues, such as production progress, work in process, machine blocks or real-time delays, as it is also supported by the extant literature (Dev et al., 2020). The most adopted systems refer to Production Management Systems (PMS) (Firm 9) and MES (Firm 5), with the latter also allowing horizontal integration with the customers' systems to control the status of the orders. The better processes control enabled by VSI can help reduce the overproduction and loss of resources and materials, thus backing the implementation of CE practices in terms of reduced energy and material consumption and waste production, while also supporting the setting of strategic environmental goals. Interestingly, firms adopting VSI introduced it to increase the control on production processes, only later acknowledging the entailed possibilities for supporting the CE transition.

        <p>ROBs are adopted by some of the sampled firms to manage the product during the overall production phases to increase resource efficiency, in particular by enabling the design of processes to minimise waste, reducing resources and energy consumption as well as waste generation, confirming Kamble &amp; Gunasekaran (2021). Some sectorial specificities emerge, such as the reduction of waste from the dyeing process (Firm 6), or the reduced consumption of plastic (Firm 10) or glue (Firm 5).

        <p>Designing process for minimisation of waste. Half of the firms implementing this CE practice (2 out of 4) are considerably supported by DTs. In particular, Firm 4 implements tests and simulations on new products by exploiting 3D printing, thus limiting both time and resource waste, whereas Firm 6 adopts ROBs to enable a more efficient design of the printing process, especially on digital printing, thus limiting the waste of dyes. The concurrent adoption of AM and ROBs is considered within previous studies. Cimini et al. (2021) include them under the term 'automation'. Lorenz et al. (2020) consider them important for 'shop floor connectivity'. Huynh (2022) includes them in the 'pull demand model' for CE transition. However, the empirical analysis shows that the two DTs do not seem to act in a synergic manner (i.e. leveraging one on the other), rather they seem to act independently.Designing process for minimisation of waste.

        <p>Reducing water and raw materials. About half of the firms implementing this CE practice (3 out of 7) are supported by different DTs (specifically, BDA, HVSYS, ROBs, and AM), although with different levels of support. These DTs act in two different manners. On the one hand, some DTs help reduce the use of input resources standalone. For example, by exploiting ROBs Firm 10 reduced the consumption of production material by 40%, whereas AM helps Firm 5 in reducing material consumption. On the other hand, other DTs are synergically adopted. For example, the joint adoption of BDA and HVSYS helps Firm 2 in controlling the process and quantitatively intervening in a targeted way. A strong synergic action between ROBs and HVSYS (MES in particular) emerges from Firm 4, where MES supports the planning of the production according to customers' orders, whereas ROBs automatically and adaptively dose the amount of material based on the specific order.Reducing water and raw materials.

For example, by exploiting ROBs Firm 10 reduced the consumption of production material by 40%, whereas AM helps Firm 5 in reducing material consumption. On the other hand, other DTs are synergically adopted. For example, the joint adoption of BDA and HVSYS helps Firm 2 in controlling the process and quantitatively intervening in a targeted way. A strong synergic action between ROBs and HVSYS (MES in particular) emerges from Firm 4, where MES supports the planning of the production according to customers' orders, whereas ROBs automatically and adaptively dose the amount of material based on the specific order.</p>
        <p>Almost half of the firms implementing this CE practice (3 out of 8) are supported by different DTs, specifically IoT, BDA, HVSYS, and ROBs. In this case as well, these DTs act in different manners. IoT, BDA, and HVSYS appear to all offer quite good support in a standalone manner, by allowing the control of energy consumption and the exploitation of optimisation techniques for its reduction. The three DTs can thus be linked to the concept of 'automated control' offered by Marcon et al. (2022). As proof, Firm 5 considers MES crucial to control the production process, thanks to the analysis of data collected from the plant through sensors. As for ROBs, their use (not coupled with other DTs) considerably supports Firm 7 to optimise the energy consumption associated with the production process.Almost half of the firms implementing this CE practice (3 out of 8) are supported by different DTs, specifically IoT, BDA, HVSYS, and ROBs.

        <p>Reducing waste.

        <p>On the one hand, some DTs help reduce waste standalone. AM shows the potential to considerably support waste reduction by allowing the conduction of tests and simulations of 3D printed products (Firm 4). HVSYS can strongly support keeping track of and control on production and logistics-related aspects (Firm 5). CLOUD can offer quite a good support for the dematerialisation of processes as the conversion to digital of active and passive invoices, active bubbles, registers of purchases and sales, and documents of transport; however, the impact of CLOUD has been identified only as for the administrative process (Firm 10). On the other hand, other DTs are synergically adopted. IoT and ROBs can act in a synergic manner, allowing tighter control over the production process, and thus over the generation of waste (Firm 7). HVSYS and BDA can act in a synergic manner too, as the data collection and analysis enabled by both DTs strongly support the reduction of waste along the supply chain, by limiting errors, excess production, and distribution waste, as well as the loss of shipments and deliveries (Firm 2).On the one hand, some DTs help reduce waste standalone.

The adopted DTs emerge as acting standalone. ROBs act on the packaging side, by allowing a reduction of the material used for the packaging (Firm 10). SIM strongly enables efficient logistics, especially concerning the delivery process (Firm 2) and the distribution chain (Firm 10). As for AM, as tests and trials can be produced via 3D printing by the firm itself, logistics activities from and to suppliers are reduced (Firm 2).Green packaging and distribution.

        <p>HVSYS and CLOUD considerably support the implementation of this CE practice by only one firm (Firm 6) among the two implementing it. The concurrent adoption of both DTs helps monitor parameters such as energy and material consumption or downtimes to support the setting of quantitative and realistic environmental targets. The possibility to collect and manage data is thus seen as an opportunity to understand the potentialities of improved CE-related performance and act accordingly.HVSYS and CLOUD considerably support the implementation of this CE practice by only one firm (Firm 6) among the two implementing it.

        <p>This CE practice is implemented by only one firm (Firm 1). The joint adoption of IoT and CYB emerges as an enabler of this practice for having a direct link with customers. Particularly, Firm 1 exploits near-field communication to trace the product, thus allowing the customer to be aware of the different stages of the production process followed by the product. At the time of the interview, the support offered by the two DTs was nonetheless limited due to their low level of adoption.This CE practice is implemented by only one firm (Firm 1).

        <p>Based on the obtained results, two different types of support provided by DTs to foster the circular transition seem to emerge (Figure 3), and each one can help achieve different objectives. The first type of support leverages a synergic interaction among DTs, which are concurrently adopted to achieve a specific objective. First, DTs can act synergically to allow better control over production processes, in terms of parameters and emissions, as well as of waste generation. For example, IoT and BDA are often coupled, as BDA allows proper exploitation of data collected through IoT. BDA can also act synergically with HVSYS, as the analysis of the collected data can greatly help the effective use of HVSYS. Last, the combination of IoT and ROBs allows effective control over the production process inputs. Second, DTs can support production planning activities. This is the case for example of the joint adoption of ROBs and HVSYS. Third, DTs can support the exploitation of data and information for performance monitoring and continuous improvements. From this perspective, the combination between HVSYS and CLOUD emerges as beneficial. Fourth, DTs can also support communication and collaboration between a firm and the other stakeholders along the supply chain. From our analysis, it emerges that the integration of IoT and CYB can offer synergic support in this direction. The second type of support is based on the adoption of a single DT in a standalone manner. Indeed, some of the analysed DTs show the potentiality to act alone to foster the circular transition. AM and SIM emerge as contributing only as standalone DTs to support the circular transition, as no synergies with other DTs emerged from our empirical investigation. Interestingly, some DTs (i.e. ROBs, HVSYS, and CLOUD) seem to support the implementation of different CE practices both alone and coupled with other DTs. On the contrary, IoT, BDA, and CYB are never adopted alone, rather they are always coupled with other DTs.Based on the obtained results, two different types of support provided by DTs to foster the circular transition seem to emerge (Figure 3), and each one can help achieve different objectives.

        <p>Our preliminary investigation sheds light on the role that DTs may have in supporting the implementation of CE practices by industrial SMEs. The results suggest that DTs are an enabler of CE practices, yet to different extents. Despite this, SMEs seem to adopt DTs mainly for production-related reasons, looking for efficiency, cost savings, and better quality. Only in a second stage do they recognise the opportunities offered by DTs to foster their circular transition. Among DTs, IoT, BDA, and ROB emerge as the most promising ones, as they strongly support the implementation of a variety of CE practices. Besides a holistic perspective on the relationship between DTs and CE practices, we provide some preliminary insights on the support towards circular transition offered by the integrated and synergic adoption of different DTs. Particularly, the integration among IoT, BDA, HVSYS, CLOUD, and ROBs is of great interest to foster the circular transition by SMEs. By performing our analysis, we respond to the call for a holistic and integrated empirical investigation of the relationship between DTs and CE practices in SMEs, thus providing interesting insights into the relationships' characterisation and tackling the digital and circular divides. Newly compared to previous literature, the level of detail offered by our analysis allows for deepening the knowledge of the supporting role played by each DT on the implementation of specific CE practices, thus offering a comprehensive perspective on the relationship between the two pivotal topics. From an academic perspective, we thus contribute to the advancement of the knowledge on the relationship between DTs and CE practices in the SMEs domain, thus offering an interesting starting point for future research. The provided knowledge is of interest from a managerial perspective as well. Industrialdecision makers are indeed provided with an understanding of how and to what extent the adoption of specific DTs could impact the circular transition, possibly allowing them to better organise their resources and concentrate their efforts towards adopting those DTs that could be more effective in achieving CE targets. Indeed, although CE and environmental conservation appear not to be primary objectives, international and national policies for pollution and waste control will make DTs' adoption even more appealing to practitioners. Finally, we should highlight the caveats of this research that nonetheless pave the way for future research. The investigated sample is appropriate for an exploratory investigation of the topic, yet the findings, being based on 10 firms (15 interviewees), do not allow generalisability. Moreover, the sample is limited to Italian manufacturing SMEsthus excluding other sectors and countries, posing limitations for the generalisation of the results in other contexts, as the specific region entails unique characteristics. The sample might also pose risks for biases, as SMEs autonomously decided to take part in the research. Future research is encouraged to replicate or expand the sample size, as well as perform empirical analyses in other contexts. For a broader understanding of the topic, we suggest including more firms characterised by different contextual factors, such as, among others, size, geographical area, and sector. As for the size, we think that interesting insights might arise from comparing SMEs with larger enterprises, but also small with medium enterprises, as previous research showed significant differences between the two of them. Such a broader understanding could also benefit the deployment of quantitative research. Specifically, we encourage future research to perform quantitative analysis to investigate co-presences and correlations between DTs and CE practices. The current debate also focuses on possible mediators of the relationship between DTs and CE practices. From our perspective, this topic actually deserves further exploration, as it can offer additional insights into the role that DTs can play in supporting the circular transition by SMEs. The main activity of Firm 1 is the production of rubber soles for shoes, particularly to be used outdoors in mountain climbing. The firm started its sustainability journey in the year 1994 through the use of an eco-compound aiming at reducing the amount of virgin material in the soles by 30%. Nowadays, Firm 1 works in three different countries and it is considered the global leader for the production of soles embedded in high-quality shoes.Our preliminary investigation sheds light on the role that DTs may have in supporting the implementation of CE practices by industrial SMEs.
