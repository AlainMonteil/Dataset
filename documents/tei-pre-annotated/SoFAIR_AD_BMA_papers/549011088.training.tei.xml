        <p>Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are the newest products in the intelligent transportation system that can move around with minimal human intervention. These products continue their path with all kinds of sensors with different parts. Effective use of these technologies in the logistics industry can create a competitive advantage. Nowadays, there are many AVs, some of which are superior to others in terms of build quality, variety of features, and design. Choosing an efficient, optimal, and reliable vehicle is one of the most important challenges in logistics planning. Therefore, choosing an AV based on a series of criteria can be considered a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. Due to the complication of decision-making issues, criteria are usually not independent of each other and there are relationships between them. Therefore, this study develop an extended MCDM framework based on Choquet integral (CI) under group decision-making with a Spherical fuzzy set (SFS) for assessing logistics AVs. The CI technique is expanded with SFS to increase the power of CI. Furthermore, the combination of CI with SFS leads to greater freedom for decision makers to express opinions and use three independent membership functions. Accordingly, the interactions between the criteria are considered and the skepticism and uncertainty present during the decision are controlled. The proposed approach is implemented in selecting the best AVs in the logistics industry, and the results are compared with Pythagorean fuzzy CI and Intuitionistic fuzzy CI. Moreover, sensitivity analysis is done by changing the weights and creating different scenarios to confirm and check the robustness of the proposed approach results. The results indicate the suggested approach's efficiency and the ranking's stability in different scenarios.Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are the newest products in the intelligent transportation system that can move around with minimal human intervention.

        <p>Today, the transportation of goods and people has a very important role in daily life and economic issues. Therefore, the environmental effects on the environment are increasing and the sustainability of the environment is threatened. Government officials and agencies are looking for innovative ways to deliver freight, with high productivity, flexibility, high reliability, and quality (Flämig, 2016;Li et al., 2021). Logistics means the whole process of moving materials, money, services, information, and goods, as well as controlling the arrivals and departures of shipments and goods and the information flow throughout the supply chain. It also includes information integration, transportation, inventory, warehousing, handling, and security (Gonzalez-R et al., 2020;Abosuliman &amp; Almagrabi, 2021). Nowadays, due to air pollution, many researchers have focused on the sustainability of all issues including production planning, supply chain, logistics, and transportation (Fathollahi-Fard et al., 2022;Kaviyani-Charati et al., 2022;Rajabzadeh et al., 2022).Today, the transportation of goods and people has a very important role in daily life and economic issues.

        <p>When the city's transportation system is sustainable and has no effect on environmental sustainability, that city can be called smart (Abosuliman &amp; Almagrabi, 2021). In modern business environments, transportation and logistics play an important role in delivering services and products to the destination. Important management decisions must be made to ensure efficient management of logistics transportation and the safety of information, resources, energy, and means of transportation (Mollanoori et al., 2019;Zahedi et al., 2021;Nezhadroshan et al., 2021). The logistics environment is vulnerable and needs fundamental changes. Also, the need to use new technology is felt due to various social, economic, political, technical, technological, and social issues (Petrović et al., 2018). On the other hand, usually, the lack of smart equipment in the field of transportation leads to the occurrence of most accidents and these accidents lead to environmental disasters.When the city's transportation system is sustainable and has no effect on environmental sustainability, that city can be called smart (Abosuliman &amp; Almagrabi, 2021).

        <p>Therefore, the use of smart technologies can prevent all environmental damage (Sadri et al., 2021). One of the newest solutions to deal with the problem of traffic and accidents are Autonomous vehicles (AVs), which, due to having electronic systems, have high performance and more accuracy than human capabilities (Severino et al., 2021). Due to current technological advances in AVs, logistics is an ideal environment for AVs implementation (Li et al., 2021). AVs are commonly known as wheeled mobile robots. Based on the high safety of these vehicles and the reduction of road accidents caused by human error, many people are in favor of these vehicles. They are also eco-friendly and in addition, can decrease exhaust pollution and progress fuel efficiency (Hula et al., 2018;Tan et al., 2019). AVs have a world map, multiple sensors installed in various components and specialized software. These sensors track the position of surrounding vehicles and pedestrians These vehicles are classified into five levels (Manogaran et al., 2020). Fig. 1 describes the five levels of AVs graphically (seniorsfuturetech.com).Therefore, the use of smart technologies can prevent all environmental damage (Sadri et al., 2021).

        <p>Adoption of AVs in logistics can create a useful competitive environment. Logistics provide the ideal work area for AVs since it provides controlled environmental operations such as remote locations and storerooms. So the logistics sector will probably use this technology sooner than passenger transport (Van Meldert &amp; De Boeck, 2016). Evaluation of AVs according to their different capabilities can be considered a group multi-criteria decision making (MCDM). The MCDM methods can present a more effective and logical approach to solve transportation decision problems (Mardani et al., 2016;Pamucar et al., 2021;Simic et al., 2022).Adoption of AVs in logistics can create a useful competitive environment.

        <p>The MCDM methods can be used for various evaluation and prioritization issues. Relationships between criteria are very important, and in many MCDM issues, criteria are interrelated or interdependent with other criteria. But in most traditional MCDM methods such as the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) (Saaty, 1977), Best-Worst method (BWM) (Rezaei, 2015;Cheraghalipour et al., 2018;Haseli et al., 2021), and Base-criterion on multi-criteria (BCM) (Haseli et al., 2020;Haseli &amp; Sheikh, 2022), these relationships are usually ignored. Ignoring the relationships between the criteria prevents accurate and reliable evaluation. To overcome this crucial challenge, this study proposes the use of the CI technique, which ensures the consideration of the dependencies between the criteria.The MCDM methods can be used for various evaluation and prioritization issues.

        <p>The crisp values are commonly used in decision-making methods to evaluate criteria (Rahnamay Bonab &amp; Osgooei, 2022). The crisp values are not always available and incapable of solving real problems. For this reason, the fuzzy sets are introduced to control uncertainty in DMs' opinions (Jafarzadeh Ghoushchi et al., 2022). Ordinary fuzzy sets were first introduced by Zadeh (1965). Due to the capability of fuzzy set theory, it was considered by many researchers and new fuzzy sets, including the type-2 fuzzy sets (Zadeh, 1975), intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFS) (Krassimir &amp; Parvathi, 1986), hesitant fuzzy sets (HFS) (Torra, 2010), and Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFS) (Yager, 2013) were developed intuitively to control data uncertainty. The Spherical fuzzy sets (SFS) introduced by Kutlu Gündogdu and Kahraman (2019b) are one of the latest extensions of the fuzzy set theory.The crisp values are commonly used in decision-making methods to evaluate criteria (Rahnamay Bonab &amp; Osgooei, 2022).

        <p>The three-dimensional nature of SFS distinguishes this set from other fuzzy sets (Ghoushchi et al., 2022). In SFS, membership, nonmembership, and hesitant degrees are defined independently and can take values between zero and one. The SFS define membership functions on a spherical surface and provide a wider range for expressing DMs' preferences than other fuzzy sets (Kutlu Gündogdu et al., 2019;Ghoushchi et al., 2021).The three-dimensional nature of SFS distinguishes this set from other fuzzy sets (Ghoushchi et al., 2022).

        <p>The aim of the present paper is to combine two powerful methods available for the first time in the field of AVs. Evaluating logistics AVs and selecting the best and most appropriate ones based on relevant criteria can help manage costs and reduce time in the logistics industry. From another point of view, choosing the best logistics AVs is essential given the diversity that exists. To ensure efficient logistics transportation management, decisions regarding AVs in the logistics industry must be made correctly and accurately. For this purpose in this study, the CI technique with SFS is expanded to the evaluation of logistic AVs. In this approach, unlike other decision-making methods, weighting is done by considering the relationships between criteria, then logistics AVs are ranked. The SFS environment allows DMs to define membership functions independently in a spherical area. Thus, considering the relationships between the criteria and controlling the ambiguity and uncertainty in the data, the proposed approach can be very effective, and given the benefits of the CI and SFS, reliable and reasonable results are obtained. Therefore, the novelty of the suggested approach is the development of an MCDM framework based on the CI under group decision making with SFS for the evaluation of AVs.The aim of the present paper is to combine two powerful methods available for the first time in the field of AVs.

        <p>Given the importance and application of AVs, Shi et al. (2019) proposed a Bilevel Optimal Motion Planning model for the automatic parking of AVs. In fact, this research presents a Optimal Motion Planning model with high speed and accuracy for parking cars. Also, Donghao Zhou et al. (2019) stated that one of the fundamental and challenging issues in the new technology of AVs is mixed-flow intersections while they interact with motorized, non-motorized and pedestrian traffic simultaneously. To solve this problem, a Decision-Plan-Action was introduced to plan the rotational motion of AVs at mixed-flow intersections. The outcomes also showed that the safety performance of AVs is better than manual vehicles.Given the importance and application of AVs, Shi et al.

        <p>Given the full acceptance of AVs and the complete transformation of global transportation, Monios &amp; Bergqvist (2020) examined the provision of services that will become a completely smart network. According to the advantages of this smart network operator and the extracted business models, an update to the well-known OECD transportation model was introduced for this smart network. Abosuliman &amp; Almagrabi (2021) studied AVs with the Internet of Things to optimize the operational process in industrial logistics and increase efficiency. They introduced an IoT-assisted intelligent logistics transportation management model to address the challenges of industrial logistics management, including: transportation costs, planning, customer service and risk management. This model has improved customer service, and reduced shipping costs by identifying optimal routes for AVs. Iranmanesh et al. (2019) proposed a path optimization algorithm for Autonomous Drone Logistics Networks. They have developed an exploratory WFPP algorithm to optimize routes, deliver packages and goods in the shortest possible time. This study shows that WFPP is more efficient than other route planning methods and delivers more packages in less time. Willems (2021) examined AVs in freight transport and material handling in logistics. Examining the results, it was found that AVs can effectively achieve mass ordering and reduce shipping time. Hence, the opportunities and challenges associated with this technology are discussed in this paper and the concrete applications of AVs are also presented. Xidias et al. (2022) studied the management of the automobile fleet. This paper examined the routing and movement planning of a fleet of AVs. Then they introduced a hybrid approach derived from the A-star algorithm with two modified genetic algorithms to make routing and motion planning decisions based on the latest traffic conditions. To check the performance and capability of the proposed model, simulated experiments were performed in Greece.

        <p>According to the review of previous researches, the lack of investigation of logistics AVs and the selection of the best and most suitable ones is felt due to the existing variety. Therefore, in this paper, an effort has been done to provide a MCDM framework for evaluating logistics AVs based on relevant criteria for efficient transportation management, cost management, and time reduction in the logistics industry. In this approach, unlike other decision-making methods, the weighting of the criteria is done by considering the relationships between the criteria, to control the ambiguity and uncertainty, the proposed approach has been implemented in the SFS environment.According to the review of previous researches, the lack of investigation of logistics AVs and the selection of the best and most suitable ones is felt due to the existing variety.

        <p>In this section, published papers on AVs that use MCDM methods are examined to examine the gaps. Zavadskas et al. (2019) declared that MCDM methods significantly impact emerging issues and new technologies. Hence, they used the CRITIC and EDAS methods to weight criteria and evaluate AVs, respectively. Also in this research, seven other MCDM methods have been used to compare the results. Karasan et al. (2019) studied the AVs driving system (ADS) and the existing safety risks and hazards on these systems. They used the AHP method to analyze and evaluate risks. Decision methods have also been used to assess the smartness of AVs. Zapolskyt ė et al. ( 2020) considered criteria such as congestion reduction measures and motor travel, travel safety and, etc. to evaluate the smartness of AVs. Also, the AHP method has been used to weigh these criteria. In addition, they claimed that the proposed model is suitable for evaluating the smart mobility system of individual cities. Dogan et al. (2020) provided a decision model based on the methods of AHP and TOPSIS to choose the appropriate road for starting AVs. Based on the relevant criteria and the results obtained, they stated that the BRT corridor is the most appropriate place to run AVs. Erdogan et al. (2021) developed a approach of DEMATEL, VIKOR and ANP methods for managing and controlling the operation of AVs. This paper aims to create a risk assessment program for AVs. Finally, the results show that software specification and reliability are the most important criteria. Deveci et al. (2021) examined issues related to traffic congestion challenges to improve traffic flow. Therefore, six different methods of realtime traffic management, in which AVs are included, have been examined based on safety, economic, environmental and political criteria. The CoCoSo method has been used to evaluate these methods. Abdel-Basset et al. (2021) studied the potential physical and security risks posed by cyber threats to AVs. Therefore, they proposed a decision model to measure and evaluate potential risks. The proposed model includes the methods of MABAC and AHP.In this section, published papers on AVs that use MCDM methods are examined to examine the gaps. Zavadskas et al.

        <p>review of the research identifies the need for a model for evaluating AVs in logistics. Examining Table 2, it can be seen that few studies have emphasized on the subject of AVs. None of the papers has examined the interactions, relationships, and interdependencies between the criteria to obtain more accurate results. In this research, SFS-based MCDM approach to fill this gap for AVs evaluation in logistics is presented. SFS is more applicable to MCDM methods to cover the disadvantages and limitations of classical methods, because in this environment uncertainty is reflected more appropriately and judgments of DMs are expressed with higher flexibility.review of the research identifies the need for a model for evaluating AVs in logistics.

        <p>Based on research, it can be seen that so far, the paper has not focused on the combination of SFS and CI. in this paper, this issue is addressed, and by creating a comprehensive decision-making framework based on SFS and CI for the first time, the relationship between the criteria is evaluated and the current situation is improved. In Table 3 the combination of CI with other fuzzy sets is presented. As can be seen, the CI is a powerful, simple, and enforceable approach to all different decision-making issues in different areas. However, given the benefits and potential of SFS, the CI has not yet been combined with SFS. Therefore, in this paper, for the first time, the SFS-CI approach under group decision-making is extended to the subject of AVs in logistics to provide more reliable, precise, and flexible results.Based on research, it can be seen that so far, the paper has not focused on the combination of SFS and CI. in this paper, this issue is addressed, and by creating a comprehensive decision-making framework based on SFS and CI for the first time, the relationship between the criteria is evaluated and the current situation is improved.

        <p>This section provides an integrated SFSCI approach to evaluating AVs in logistics is provided. The basic concepts of SFS and the steps of the proposed approach are presented in this section. Zadeh (1965) first introduced the theory of fuzzy sets to control the skepticism and uncertainty in decision problems. Researchers then developed new fuzzy sets, including IFS, HFS, Neutrosophic set (NS) and PFS for more reliable results. Finally, SFS were introduced by Kutlu Gündogdu and Kahraman (2019b) as the expansion of IFS, NS and PFS. In the SFS, the hesitant degree is not determined by the values of membership and non-membership degrees. In addition, all degrees of membership, non-membership and hesitation are defined independently. Accordingly, DMs are more flexible in expressing their views (Kutlu Gündogdu and Kahraman, 2019a;Ghoushchi et al., 2021). This section presents some of the properties, arithmetic operations, and principles of SFS.This section provides an integrated SFSCI approach to evaluating AVs in logistics is provided.

        <p>In recent times, many technologies have evolved that affect the logistics industry. AVs are one of the newest technologies that can make an impact in the logistics field and also change logistics dynamics extensively. Due to their features such as computer technology, artificial intelligence, camera technology, GPS technology and sensor technology, these vehicles eliminate human interference as much as possible. AVs are rarely gaining market share. In 2019, approximately 31 million people were working with this technology worldwide, and their number is expected to reach more than 54 million in 2024 (Autonomous vehicles worldwide1 *). Not only car companies but also the top tech giants have invested heavily in this area. AVs can not only eliminate driver errors and increase safety, but also deliver goods safely to their destination. AVs can make decisions in seconds, which is certainly somewhat impossible for humans.In recent times, many technologies have evolved that affect the logistics industry.

SFS, with membership, non-membership, and hesitant degrees, allow DMs to express their opinions and judgments with greater freedom. As a result, uncertainty is reduced and leads to more accurate results. Therefore, the SFS is more competent in managing decision-making issues in situations of uncertainty and inaccuracy. The proposed model can simultaneously consider the criteria's interactions and reduce the uncertainty in the decision. The novelty of this paper stems from its power to showcase CI development in the SFS.New in MCDM issues, evaluation criteria may not be independent of each other and there may be relationships between them.

        <p>The present study, like other researches, faces limitations. One of the main limitations is access to data and information needed to check AVs. In this paper, the opinions and evaluations of three experts have been used to review and prioritize AVs, which may lead to different results with the opinions and evaluations of different experts. Also, the scale of spherical fuzzy linguistic variables used in this research is a 9-point scale. If the scale becomes larger and the number of linguistic variables increases, experts will express their opinions with greater freedom and breadth.The present study, like other researches, faces limitations.

        <p>This finding provides the following insights for future research: In future research, more experts in this field can be used to improve the accuracy and validity of the results. Also, considering the importance of environmental sustainability, criteria related to sustainability can be added, which is very important. On the other hand, due to the unavailability of information, the proposed approach can be implemented using the theory of Z number or R number to test the reliability of opinions of experts and the use of two fuzzy numbers. Also, the proposed approach can be implemented for other decision-making issues, including large-scale transportation management, sustainable transportation, and digital carbon footprint review. Furthermore, other MCDM methods that were not involved in this study can be used, such as BCM, LMAW, BWM, CoCoSo, and MARCOS in the SFS environment.This finding provides the following insights for future research: In future research, more experts in this field can be used to improve the accuracy and validity of the results.
