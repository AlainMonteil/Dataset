        <p>Physical Internet (PI) is an open global logistics system of which components are hyperconnected for increased efficiency and sustainability. Digital twin (DT), referring to the virtual representation of a physical object, is well-perceived as a key driver in the development of PI-based Supply Chain Management (SCM). Due to the capabilities of real-time monitoring and evaluation of large-scale complex systems, significant research efforts have been made to exploit values of PI/DT in SCM. Despite this, the current literature remained largely unstructured and scattered due to a lack of systematic literature reviews to synergise research findings, analyse the evolution of research fronts and extract emerging trends in the field. To address this issue, the paper deploys a bibliometric knowledge mapping approach to provide a bird's eye view of the current research status in the PI/DT-SCM area. Using 
            <rs type="software">CiteSpace</rs>'s keyword co-occurrence network, 518 journal articles are clustered into 10 key research streams on PI/DT applications in: job shop scheduling, smart manufacturing design, PI-based SCM, manufacturing virtualisation, information management, sustainability development, data analytics, manufacturing operations management, simulation and optimisation, and assembly process planning. Based on citation burst rate, keywords representing research frontiers of the PI/DT are detected and their temporal evolutions are discussed. Likewise, some identified emerging research trends are production process and system, robotics, computer architecture, and cost. Finally, seven future research directions are suggested, which emphasise on several PI/DT-related issues, including business ecosystem, sustainability development, SC downstream management, cognitive thinking in Industry 5.0, citizen twin in digital society, and SC resilience.

        <p>Fourth Industry Revolution (Industry 4.0) paradigm connotes the creation and convergence of cutting-edge technologies, e.g., Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), cloud computing, and digital twins, which are ubiquitous. These prevailing innovations are in dire need of productivity enhancement and automation that reduces human flaws and intervention (Gaikwad et al., 2020;Sheuly et al., 2021) .Fourth Industry Revolution (Industry 4.0) paradigm connotes the creation and convergence of cutting-edge technologies, e.g., Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), cloud computing, and digital twins, which are ubiquitous.

        <p>Over the last decade, the terms of physical internet (PI), digital twin (DT) and their related innovations have gained many attentions among scholars. PI is defined as a seamless global logistics and distribution infrastructure incorporating physical objects (e.g., sensors) and interfaces to digitally interconnect (Montreuil, 2011). It is expected to help overcome the inefficiencies of the current logistics paradigm in the global volatile market context (Ballot et al., 2012). Indeed, significant efforts have been made to explore various applications and advanced techniques of PI in transportation and distribution aspects such as material handling system (Fahim et al., 2021;Hao Luo et al., 2021;Montreuil et al., 2010;Pan et al., 2017), interconnected modular containers (Lin et al., 2014;Sarraj et al., 2014), informational dimensions of PI-container (Sallez et al., 2016), auction logistics (Kong et al., 2016) and humanitarian SC (Grest et al., 2021). Its applications are also reaching to the operations of well-known firms such as Amazon, UPS and Fedex (Dans, 2019).Over the last decade, the terms of physical internet (PI), digital twin (DT) and their related innovations have gained many attentions among scholars.

        <p>As the Covid-19 pandemic has been accelerating the transformation of digital economy and digital society, DT, which refers to the digital representation of non-living and living physical objects (e.g., people, process, system, and others), has soon become one of the key technological enablers in the new era. With the capabilities to generate virtual instances and control the changes of a physical object in real-time, DT is often integrated with advanced technologies such as IoT, big data analytics and blockchain, to develop smart, interconnected supply chain (SC) and logistics system, so called logistics/SC DT (Ivanov et al., 2019;Ivanov and Dolgui, 2021). Some perceived benefits of DT in SC management (SCM) are to remotely and instantly monitor the operations (e.g., production) and proactively mitigate risks and disruptions through timely decision makings (Ait-Alla et al., 2021;Tao et al., 2019b). Due to its functions, DT is thus well-known as a key driver of hyperconnected PI systems. Its applications and values have also been rapidly gaining relevancy in both academics and practices recently.As the Covid-19 pandemic has been accelerating the transformation of digital economy and digital society, DT, which refers to the digital representation of non-living and living physical objects (e.g., people, process, system, and others), has soon become one of the key technological enablers in the new era.

        <p>Given the emerging nature of the PI/DT in SCM topic, not surprisingly, there is a limited number of literature reviews available, and most of them only focus on niche subject areas, for example, smart manufacturing system design (Leng et al., 2021;Semeraro et al., 2021), information sharing in remanufacturing (Chen and Huang, 2021a), product design and development (Lo et al., 2021), sustainable intelligent manufacturing (He and Bai, 2021), additive manufacturing (Zhang et al., 2020), auction logistics (Kong et al., 2018), and smart maintenance (Errandonea et al., 2020). Few review papers take more holistic view of PI/DT across various SCM disciplines. Sternberg and Norrman (2017) prominently focused on PI literature discussing about the concept and provided research agenda using content analysis. Treiblmaier et al. (2020) reviewed the evolution of PI in the context of logistics and SCM practices. These unveil a significant gap in exploring the evolution of PI and DT literature in the holistic SCM research domain. Furthermore, all the mentioned reviews adopted either conventional content analysis approach, bibliometric analysis such as co-citation, co-author analysis or text mining approach. They cannot fully capture the critical paths and evolution of research forefronts overtime. The work by Treiblmaier et al. (2020) did study the evolution of PI in SCM, but using only thematic analysis, which is subject to limitations such as timeconsuming and susceptibility to human errors, hence, the inability to work with a large volume of literature.Given the emerging nature of the PI/DT in SCM topic, not surprisingly, there is a limited number of literature reviews available, and most of them only focus on niche subject areas, for example, smart manufacturing system design (Leng et al., 2021;Semeraro et al., 2021), information sharing in remanufacturing (Chen and Huang, 2021a), product design and development (Lo et al., 2021), sustainable intelligent manufacturing (He and Bai, 2021), additive manufacturing (Zhang et al., 2020), auction logistics (Kong et al., 2018), and smart maintenance (Errandonea et al., 2020).

        <p>To help fill in the research gap and overcome certain limitations in existing methodologies, this paper takes a holistic view of the literature in PI and DT in SCM, deploys a hybrid approach with bibliometric knowledge mapping using co-occurrence keywords, and timeline analysis to detect and analyse the research frontiers and their evolutions over time, thus triggering new research opportunities for future studies. The proposed approach is believed to be more robust and scalable than other comparable papers in the field. In particular, this literature review aims to address three key research questions as below: The remain of the paper is organised as follows.

        <p>Regarding inclusion criteria, studies that focusing on the application of DT or development of PI to solve SCM's issues are included. Even though simulation is only one of the three important features of DT besides data and modelling, in the earlier years, most of the literature defined DT as multidisciplinary simulation without taking into consideration the real-time connection with the physical entity (M. Liu et al., 2021). Therefore, we included papers where the authors use simulation interchangeably with DT as well.Regarding inclusion criteria, studies that focusing on the application of DT or development of PI to solve SCM's issues are included.

        <p>Bibliometric is one of the most common quantitative approaches for systematic literature review. The technique was first suggested by Alan Pritchard, a British intelligence scientist, in 1969. Since then, it has been widely adopted in a variety of fields such as medicine (Kokol et al., 2020), distribution (Z.-C. Li et al., 2020), SC finance (Xu et al., 2018), and marketing (Martínez-López et al., 2018). The frequency of keyword occurrence is a commonly used method in bibliometric analysis to identify research topics and research frontiers (Su and Lee, 2010). Keyword co-occurrence network (KCN) is the interconnected system between keywords that appear in at least two different articles. Typically, a KCN is formed by keyword nodes connected by links, of which the thickness indicates the number of times the keyword pair co-occurs (Error! Reference source not found.). Figure 6. A simple keyword co-occurrence network (Radhakrishnan et al., 2017) Since keywords reflect the main content of a research article, keyword analysis can reveal the key topics of the paper, as well as the relevancy of two or more documents. Therefore, the KCN can summarise a selected field more accurately by focusing more on the literature content rather than the results (Radhakrishnan et al., 2017). Furthermore, compared to other bibliometric techniques, the KCN analysis minimises the subjective bias in judgement (Peters and van Raan, 1993). Due to its advantages, KCN is performed in this paper to explore the emerging topic of DT in SCM.Bibliometric is one of the most common quantitative approaches for systematic literature review.

        <p>To address RQ2, we analysed CiteSpace's keyword citation burst and timeline view of the KCN, while emerging research trends as part of RQ3 were identified using 
            <rs type="software">CiteSpace</rs>'s keyword citation burst.
        </p>
        <p>Adapted from Kleinberg's (2002) burst detection algorithm, 
            <rs type="software">CiteSpace</rs> can extract the burst terms which are explosive keywords with sharp increases of interest over a certain period of time. The more abrupt change of the keyword, the more popularity and attention is being paid to it within the considered time interval, and to some degree, it represents the research front and hotspot of a subject area (Chen, 2006;Q. Li et al., 2020). Timeline view is an effective visualisation approach which helps evaluating trends. This is based on human ability to capture spatial proximity between any two items and deduce their relation (Morris et al., 2003). Small and Greenlee (1989) used timeline view to show temporal relations between research topics along with their evolution and diversification in AIDS research from 1981 to 1987. Meanwhile, Braam et al. (1991) used timeline view to explore the growth of several characteristics, such as citation rates of key documents, or of a set of documents over time.
        </p>
        <p>
            <rs type="software">CiteSpace</rs> is used in this paper to build the KCN and cluster analysis for 518 documents collected. The software is a Java-based application developed by Chen (2006), with scientific literature data mining and visualisation as the main feature. The 
            <rs type="software">CiteSpace</rs> parameter settings for KCN are as follow: (1) The time span is from 2013 to 2021, reflecting the publication period of all collected articles. Time slice is selected as one year. (2) Term sources include author keywords (i.e. author selected keywords in the published paper) and indexed keyword (i.e. publisher selected keywords), as suggested by Duvvuru et al. (2013). (3) Keyword is selected as the node type in the network as shown in Error! Reference source not found.. Finally, (4) G-index with k=7 is selected as criteria for cluster analysis.
        </p>
        <p>A scaling value k of G-index (Egghe, 2006) is a metric using in 
            <rs type="software">CiteSpace</rs> to sample high cited papers to be visualised in the network (Diez-Martin et al., 2019;Zhu and Hua, 2017). It helps simplify the KCN while highlight the most impactful nodes in each cluster. The Silhouette metric is useful to evaluate the nature of a cluster by taking into account its keyword members (Diez-Martin et al., 2019). Several experiments with various k of g-index should be implemented to derive the optimal average Silhouette score (Chen Chaomei, 2020). Previous works have used the Silhouette score to evaluate the precision and degree of homogeneity between the keywords forming each cluster (Chen et al., 2010;Rawat and Sood, 2021). The default setting on 
            <rs type="software">CiteSpace</rs> is k = 25. After various k ranging from 5 to 35 were tested, k = 7 yields the best result for the clustering task (Silhouette values = 0.9481).
        </p>
        <p>The clusters based on KCN are obtained and visualised in Figure 7. As a result, 10 labelled clusters are identified.The clusters based on KCN are obtained and visualised in Figure 7. As a result, 10 labelled clusters are identified.</p>
        <p>Table 2 shows the most important keywords for each cluster based on the Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) ranking system. LLR (Dunning, 1993) is a statistical metric to rank and test the significance of rare and common keywords. It is calculated by considering the frequencies of a keyword in all papers and number of keywords in each paper. A keyword with a high LLR represents the high strength of association within a set of papers.Table 2 shows the most important keywords for each cluster based on the Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) ranking system.

        <p>The silhouette value of a cluster measures the quality of a clustering configuration. Its value ranges between -1 and 1.

        <p>The cluster labels were decided by the authors based on common themes among the top keywords ranked by LLR. Labelling cluster using common themes is a practical strategy as comprehensively identifying the nature of one group of research papers can be too complex (Chen et al., 2010). For instance, White and McCain (1998) along with Zhao and Strotmann (2008) relied on their decades of specialist knowledge to decide the common themes of the members of specialties.The cluster labels were decided by the authors based on common themes among the top keywords ranked by LLR.

        <p>From the original set of articles in every cluster that were obtained from CiteSpace (518 papers), the most representative papers for each cluster were selected (211 papers in total across all clusters) by matching each cluster's top ten keywords ranked by LLR as in Table 2.From the original set of articles in every cluster that were obtained from CiteSpace (518 papers), the most representative papers for each cluster were selected (211 papers in total across all clusters) by matching each cluster's top ten keywords ranked by LLR as in Table 2.</p>
        <p>To determine the research focus for each cluster with in-depth content analysis, lead papers were identified using Scimago Journal Ranking (SJR) system. This is a common practice within bibliometric literature review (e.g., Fahimnia et al., 2015;Xu et al., 2018), where lead papers represent a general description of each cluster. Overall, out of 211 papers, 94 papers published in journals of SJR Q1 (best quartile) were selected for further in-depth content analysis due to their generally higher academic rigour and quality. These papers are analysed in Section 3.2 around the corresponding cluster's keywords. The summary of paper members of each cluster can be seen in Appendix. *Note: the detailed discussion of each cluster is shown in Section 3.2To determine the research focus for each cluster with in-depth content analysis, lead papers were identified using Scimago Journal Ranking (SJR) system.

        <p>There are two main research streams in DT-AI-based approaches: (1) monitoring and forecasting, and (2) defect detection. For monitoring, with growing digital transformation and the integration of sensors and cameras in manufacturing sector, DT-based technologies such as computer vision can generate both synthesis and real-time data (e.g., image, 3D and historical data). It empowers AI techniques, e.g., deep learning (DL) and ML to monitor and predict the WIP and machine quality in material processing (e.g., welding, metal), machine maintenance and assembly (Aivaliotis et al., 2021;Alexopoulos et al., 2020;Klingaa et al., 2021;Q. Wang et al., 2020;Yi et al., 2021). In terms of defect detection, product or process-generated data from IoTs can be used to visualise as a digital replica of a physical object. By building ML/DL predictive models, a simulation of scenarios and errors can be visible in a complex manufacturing process, hence helps minimise defect rate (Sheuly et al., 2021;Xia et al., 2021). This approach has also been widely studied specifically in laser powder bed fusion, one of the most popular additive manufacturing (3d printing) processes (Gaikwad et al., 2020;Mukherjee and DebRoy, 2019).

However, with the availability of DT tools enabling a continuous single flow of information along the product lifecycle, obtaining accurate geometrical deviations of compliant parts could become feasible. In particular, DT of product design could be built to send real-time specifications information and variation information to support the general assembly planning (Franciosa et al., 2020;Polini and Corrado, 2020;Sierla et al., 2018), including in automotive industry (Balakrishnan et al., 2019).

        <p>In response to RQ1, ten clusters representing the research frontiers are summarised in Table 3. Top 20 keywords with the strongest citation bursts are presented in Figure 13, in which "Year" represents the starting time of the analysis, "Strength" shows the burst rate, "Begin" and "End" indicate the starting and ending year of the burst duration. As can be seen, prior to 2019, a larger extent of research efforts was into the technological development of PI-based system as keywords with high citation bursts are "physical internet", "internet", "internet of thing", "virtual reality", "big data", "digital storage", and "computer simulation". From 2019 onwards, as the technological capabilities become more matured, the research focus has shifted towards the implementation of PI and DT in SC applications, in which several operational management issues are addressed as implied in burst terms like "production system", "production process", "robotics", and "cost". Apart from citation burst, research fronts can also be identified based on the keyword's betweenness centrality and Sigma ( ). The centrality estimates the number of times a node belongs to the shortest paths of any pair of nodes in the KCN (Radhakrishnan et al., 2017). The keyword with higher centrality reflects the greater influence in the KCN. Sigma () combines both the burst rate and betweenness centrality to indicate the transformative strength of a keyword over a time interval (F.-F. Cheng et al., 2018). Hence, to capture a more integrative view of research frontiers, we identify top 30 most important keywords based on their Sigma values, as presented in Table 4.In response to RQ1, ten clusters representing the research frontiers are summarised in Table 3.

        <p>The first keyword within DT/PI application in SCM research domain was "computer simulation" from 2013.

        <p>The evolution of "physical internet" keyword in the KCN can be seen in Figure 9 (only shows nodes having direct connection with "physical internet") and Figure 10 below. Starting from 2014, PI was first brought up as an approach to improve the logistics efficiency by creating synchronised interconnections between logistics networks (Sarraj et al., 2014). In the same year, to establish the foundation for PI, Lin et al. (2014) initiated the idea of standardising packaging and containers for more efficient product handling across the network. During 2015 -2016, while there were still works on PI-container design (Sallez et al., 2016), a fast-growing number of research worked on PI-based logistics operations issues such as transportation and inventory problem (Pan et al., 2015) or resource allocation (Walha et al., 2016). From 2017 to 2018, while logistics problems remained of interest (Onal et al., 2018;Yang et al., 2017a), researchers started to extend the PI concept to manufacturing shop floor (Onal et al., 2018;Zhong et al., 2017) and urban logistic (Ben Mohamed et al., 2017;Fazili et al., 2017;Sun et al., 2018). In 2019, blockchain was first discussed alongside PI as one of the key technological enablers (Meyer et al., 2019), even though the general theme was still logistic network and manufacturing related. Some new research streams were also emerged to bring PI implementation closer to the practice, for example cost minimisation (e.g. Ji et al., 2019) and sustainability assessment (e.g. L. Li et al., 2020). With the maturity of IoT and ML techniques, 2020 witnessed a rise of works in utilising big data-driven and ML-supported solutions to different DT-based SC problems (Kantasa-ard et al., 2020;Vanvuchelen et al., 2020). During the first half of 2021, most research was to tackle transportation, and vehicle routing problem (Ancele et al., 2021;H Luo et al., 2021;Yee et al., 2021).The evolution of "physical internet" keyword in the KCN can be seen in Figure 9 (only shows nodes having direct connection with "physical internet") and Figure 10 below.

        <p>The evolution of "digital twin" keyword in the KCN can be seen in Figure 11 (only shows nodes having direct connection with "digital twin") and Figure 12. At the early stage in 2017, works were mainly focused on the introduction of DT concept into manufacturing (Brenner and Hummel, 2017;Tao and Zhang, 2017;Uhlemann et al., 2017;Zhang et al., 2017), and exploring DT's potential in virtualising machines (Angrish et al., 2017) or manufacturing process (Moreno et al., 2017). Moving on to 2018, while works were still underway in virtualisation of manufacturing process (Lu and Xu, 2018), researches focused more on exploiting the convergence of physical and virtual data in DT-enabled smart manufacturing (Y. Cheng et al., 2018;Qi and Tao, 2018;Zheng et al., 2018;Zhuang et al., 2018). In the meantime, new paradigms were added and even carried into 2019 such as cloud technology (Lu and Xu, 2019;Urbina Coronado et al., 2018), and DT-driven product design (Tao et al., 2019a(Tao et al., , 2018)).The evolution of "digital twin" keyword in the KCN can be seen in Figure 11 (only shows nodes having direct connection with "digital twin") and Figure 12.

        <p>From the cluster analysis, it is clear that research in PI/DT application in SCM is still in its infancy and highly fragmented.

        <p>As suggested by cluster 4, in line with the transition towards circular economy, the traceability of PI/DT can play a key role in improving the performance of reverse logistics and closed loop-SC operations. For example, to enhance product recycling rate, PI/DT can help firms track and trace the whole product life cycle including its reverse flows, thereby accurately predicting the quality, quantity and timing of the core returns. Prior studies have explored the value of PI/DT in remanufacturing (Chen and Huang, 2021b); however, by elaborating its benefits to address the issues of return uncertainty across closed-loop SC, this can be a valuable and fruitful research area for future scholars.As suggested by cluster 4, in line with the transition towards circular economy, the traceability of PI/DT can play a key role in improving the performance of reverse logistics and closed loop-SC operations.
