        <p>Current modes of production result in unsustainable socioeconomic and environmental consequences (Ansell and Cayzer, 2018;Freire, 2018): substantial long-term oriented changes are required and should be implemented through both sustainable products and sustainable industrial processes, from a technological, managerial, organizational and behavioural perspective (Blok et al., 2015). The role of sustainability in industrial supply chains (SCs) is central in the industry and management related debate (De Angelis et al., 2017;Tavassoli et al., 2020). Competition is nowadays occurring amongst whole industrial systems rather than single firms (Massaroni et al., 2015;Shibin et al., 2017) and high advantages can be brought holistically addressing sustainability (Carter and Rogers, 2008;Taticchi et al., 2015).Current modes of production result in unsustainable socioeconomic and environmental consequences (Ansell and Cayzer, 2018;Freire, 2018): substantial long-term oriented changes are required and should be implemented through both sustainable products and sustainable industrial processes, from a technological, managerial, organizational and behavioural perspective (Blok et al., 2015).

        <p>Definitions of sustainable SC are thus focused on the creation of a bridge between sustainability and SC (Ahi and Searcy, 2013). A sustainable SC can be then addressed a systemic and strategic coordination and relationships among firm's functions and different firms (Carter and Rogers, 2008;Seuring and Müller, 2008), with the final aim of improving in the long -but finite (Babu and Mohan, 2018)term the sustainability performance both of firms and SC firms (Stock and Boyer, 2009). The sustainability performance addressed should simultaneously consider and balance the three dimensions of sustainability, as well as their intersections (Cagno et al., 2019(Cagno et al., , 2018)), particularly integrating the environmental and social ones with the economic criteria (Gualandris et al., 2015;Seuring and Müller, 2008).Definitions of sustainable SC are thus focused on the creation of a bridge between sustainability and SC (Ahi and Searcy, 2013).

        <p>The inclusion of sustainability within a SC, however, appears rather challenging (Jaehn, 2016). Sustainability measurement is the backbone (Howard et al., 2018) for many following activities such as improvement actions (Trianni et al., 2017), reporting (Katiyar et al., 2018), and benchmarking (Ferrari et al., 2019). Nevertheless, the required engagement and coordination among all tiers necessary for proper measurement of performance (Pagell and Shevchenko, 2014;Varsei et al., 2014) is hard to obtain (Marshall et al., 2016) and looks even more difficult when the metrics both within and across organizations are lacking (Carter et al., 2019). Recent research has highlighted two main challenges: the adoption of a standard but context-based set of performance indicators (PIs) (Rojaslema et al., 2020) and the inclusion of SC tiers (Bové and Swart, 2016;Searcy, 2017). Measuring SC sustainability performance implies the consideration of all the players in the SC (Searcy, 2016) but identifying priorities and tracing impacts, aligning data collection and reporting systems can be extremely difficult, above all in SCs encompassing potentially several different tiers (Searcy and Ahi, 2014). Both academia and industry suggested the need for a concise set of general PIs, allowing different results to be compared with minimal level for reporting and with a long-term perspective (NAEM, 2019;Searcy and Ahi, 2014).The inclusion of sustainability within a SC, however, appears rather challenging (Jaehn, 2016).

        <p>Reporting standards already exist, as ESG1 and GRI 2 (EQUITA, 2020;KPMG, 2017). The ESG one is recognized to bring positive effect to the industrial world from a system perspective (Forbes, 2019), nevertheless few firms are using it within the scope of SC (Callan Istitute, 2019). As a large share of firms would need a more standardized approach toward ESG (EQUITA, 2020), firms practically mainly rely on the GRI Standard (KPMG, 2017). Nevertheless, the GRI still presents specific issues for its widespread applicability. Firstly, it presents a corporate perspective rather than an operative (Fuente et al., 2017;Sisco and Chorn, 2009) and process-oriented one (Raine and Ulrich, 2009), besides being recognized as difficult to assess (Sangwan et al., 2019); as for the last issue, many indicators considered in the GRI require information not easily to be collected and are challenging to evaluate, while no guidelines are provided on how to select the right indicators (Adams and Ghaly, 2006;Sangwan et al., 2019). Secondly, it is mainly adopted by large corporations (Chen et al., 2015;Dragu and Tiron-tudor, 2010), and the GRI itself recognized the urgency to modify the standard to reach Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) (GRI, 2018) as well as companies currently striving to introduce sustainability in their daily activities (Cagno et al., 2019). Thirdly, specific shortcomings of GRI have been highlighted when trying to address the overall SC, with further issues arising for those sectors with strong relationships and dependencies among the different tiers (Chen et al., 2015;Isaksson and Garvare, 2003).Reporting standards already exist, as ESG1 and GRI 2 (EQUITA, 2020;KPMG, 2017).

        <p>Therefore, despite thousands of PIs have been developed (Ahi and Searcy, 2013), research is still lacking the identification of the appropriate PIs (Bai and Sarkis, 2018;Taticchi et al., 2015) given the heterogeneity of firms within a SC in terms of contexts, industries, size and sustainability awareness. Furthermore, since PIs would not equally fit in all contexts (Rojas-lema et al., 2020), previous literature deems crucial to identify general key performance indicators (KPIs), representing a minimum set for the evaluation of sustainability performance and a common ground for firms characterized by different contextual factors, availability of resources and sustainability awareness. Such a set could then be complemented by specific PIs designed by individual firms and tailored to the unique needs of their own SCs (Ahi and Searcy, 2015;Searcy, 2017).Therefore, despite thousands of PIs have been developed (Ahi and Searcy, 2013), research is still lacking the identification of the appropriate PIs (Bai and Sarkis, 2018;Taticchi et al., 2015) given the heterogeneity of firms within a SC in terms of contexts, industries, size and sustainability awareness.

        <p>Starting from this main research gap, the present work aims at developing a balanced general set of KPIs for evaluating the sustainability-related performance in the context of industrial SCs, also providing an empirical validation of the set, as strongly suggested by Taticchi et al. (2015). The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Stemming from the review of previous literature (Section 2), we defined the methods for the development of the new set of KPIs and its validation (Section 3). We then presented the set and the results from its validation, thoroughly discussing the theoretical foundations of our set of KPIs in light of the empirical validation (Section 4). We have further summarized the contributions of the study, acknowledging limitations of the study and sketching future research avenues in this domain (Section 5).Starting from this main research gap, the present work aims at developing a balanced general set of KPIs for evaluating the sustainability-related performance in the context of industrial SCs, also providing an empirical validation of the set, as strongly suggested by Taticchi et al.

        <p>To get an understanding of previous models for measuring sustainability performance in an industrial SC, we opted for a narrative literature review, taking an in-depth but no systematic approach (Green et al., 2006;Robinson and Lowe, 2015). According to Carter and Washispack (2018), indeed, the wealth of systematic literature reviews on the specific topic under evaluation leaves room for just periodic updates.To get an understanding of previous models for measuring sustainability performance in an industrial SC, we opted for a narrative literature review, taking an in-depth but no systematic approach (Green et al., 2006;Robinson and Lowe, 2015).

        <p>To retrieve relevant contributions in the field, we identified an initial set of contributions considering literature reviews addressing sustainability-related performance in SCs published from 2015 onwards (Table 1). We then applied snowball method on this initial set: as suggested by Heckathorn and Cameron (2017) and applied by several scholars (Harris et al., 2021;Skolarus et al., 2017;Wohlin, 2014), the snowballing takes the form of identifying an initial set of contributions from which new contributions to analyse are retrieved using the references and the citations (Backward and Forward Snowballing). We are confident that previous literature reviews can provide an in-depth and complete overview on what was developed recently and so far (Carter and Washispack, 2018), allowing us to use them as a solid initial set.To retrieve relevant contributions in the field, we identified an initial set of contributions considering literature reviews addressing sustainability-related performance in SCs published from 2015 onwards (Table 1).

        <p>Each contribution of the initial set was studied, paying attention to its references (Backward Snowballing) and to those contributions citing it (Forward Snowballing) (Wohlin, 2014). Starting from the initial set of 15 reviews reported in Table 1, we identified 69 relevant contributions (Table 2 and Table 3) proposing a model or framework for the evaluation of sustainability performance in SCs. These contributions have been addressed with a twofold perspective: on the one hand, we analysed the specific content and context of development and application; on the other hand, we analysed the indicators provided by all the contributions in the overall. The two analyses led to the identification of interesting open research gaps.Each contribution of the initial set was studied, paying attention to its references (Backward Snowballing) and to those contributions citing it (Forward Snowballing) (Wohlin, 2014).

        <p>Regarding the organizations of the proposed indicators (Table 2), authors mainly chose a standard (Clift, 2003;Susanty et al., 2019) or slightly modified (Uysal, 2012) Triple Bottom Line (TBL) approach, or a Balanced Scorecard (BSC) framework (Brewer and Speh, 2000;Verdecho et al., 2020). Besides, a few authors used a classification based on the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) (Bai et al., 2012;Subramanian and Gunasekaran, 2015), developed their categorization (Beamon, 1999;Popovic et al., 2018), or just provided a list of indicators (Ahi and Searcy, 2015;Hassini et al., 2012). Some authors also further characterized the proposed indicators according to decision levels -tactical, strategical, operational (Baba et al., 2019;Liebetruth, 2017), financial base -financial, non-financial (Bhagwat and Sharma, 2007a;Gunasekaran and Kobu, 2007), measurement basequalitative, quantitative (Chan, 2003;Shepherd and Günter, 2006) and components of performance -time, cost, quality, flexibility, asset (Sellitto et al., 2015;Stefanović and Stefanović, 2011). Some contributions focused on other specific characteristics (Narimissa et al., 2020;Said et al., 2020), but the majority did not provide any characterization.Regarding the organizations of the proposed indicators (Table 2), authors mainly chose a standard (Clift, 2003;Susanty et al., 2019) or slightly modified (Uysal, 2012) Triple Bottom Line (TBL) approach, or a Balanced Scorecard (BSC) framework (Brewer and Speh, 2000;Verdecho et al., 2020).

        <p>As for the type of the study (Table 3), based on Murillo-Luna et al. (2011) and Seuring (2013), the selected contributions are almost equally divided between only theoretical ones (Ortas et al., 2014;Schaltegger and Burritt, 2014) and theoretical ones with an empirical application (Erol et al., 2011;Govindan et al., 2013). The proposed models and indicators were not developed to specifically address a given context, except for a few cases. As for sectors, contributions took up manufacturing in general (Thakkar et al., 2009), or a specific sector, among them food (Sufiyan et al., 2019), textile (Charkha and Jaju, 2015) and automotive (Gopal and Thakkar, 2015); regarding the geographical area, contributions mainly addressed Asia (Xu et al., 2016); about firms' dimension, only two contributions were specifically developed for Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) (Faisal, 2012;Thakkar et al., 2009). From an empirical perspective, authors explored several contexts of applications. Specific industries were investigated, among them automotive (Büyüksaatçi Kiriş et al., 2020), textile (Verdecho et al., 2012), plastic (Xu et al., 2016), as well as the manufacturing sector in general (Chia et al., 2009); as for geographical area, authors conducted studies in single countries in Europe -among them Italy and Portugal (Ferreira et al., 2016;Marconi et al., 2017), Asiaamong them India and Thailand (Malviya and Kant, 2019;Sopadang et al., 2017), and the Middle East (Tajbakhsh and Hassini, 2015); few contributions focused on a particular size, with examples on SMEs (Bhagwat and Sharma, 2007b;Faisal, 2012), Medium Enterprises (Erol et al., 2011) and Large Enterprises (Jalali Naini et al., 2011;Olugu and Wong, 2012).As for the type of the study (Table 3), based on Murillo-Luna et al.

        <p>From the selected contributions detailed in Table 2 and Table 3, 2,661 single sustainability performance measures were retrieved. Due to high heterogeneity, we classified the indicators in different "performance areas" and identified the specific "performance" related to each performance area. Furthermore, for each performance, different "performance indicators" can be related, in turn, gaugeable adopting different "performance measures". Performance areas and performance were deductively defined based on the reviewed contributions reported in Table 2 and Table 3, grounding on the approach of Saeed and Kersten (2017) and Stindt (2017). The retrieved indicators and measures were pigeonholed according to the identified performance areas and performance.From the selected contributions detailed in Table 2 and Table 3, 2,661 single sustainability performance measures were retrieved.

        <p>An example of the procedure followed for the classification of indicators is reported in detail for the performance area costs, that emerged as relevant for SC. The reviewed literature considers a wide and comprehensive spectrum of costs associated with the operating of a SC (Charkha and Jaju, 2014), and the total SC cost performance is considered by almost all contributions selected. A large share of contributions consider a general minimization of cost (Büyük zkan and Ci fçi, 2013), or refer straightforwardly to SC management cost (Sangwan et al., 2019), while other provide a more detailed list of costs. As the single costs considered in the literature show a high heterogeneity, we decided to analyse them according to the direct/indirect classification (Xu et al., 2009), adding cost variance as a third performance. Direct costs gather indicators spanning over the source-make-deliver-return SCOR structure, as supply cost (Tajbakhsh and Hassini, 2015), production cost -to which labour cost is strictly related (Hervani et al., 2005), inventory cost including obsolescence, opportunity and Stockout costs (Büyüksaatçi Kiriş et al., 2020), distribution and transportation cost (Bigliardi and Bottani, 2010), disposal cost (Bhattacharya et al., 2014) and return cost (Liebetruth, 2017). Indirect costs consider the importance of transaction cost (Aramyan et al., 2007), information carrying cost (Charkha and Jaju, 2015), sales and advertisement cost (Mishra and Sharma, 2014), training cost (Narimissa et al., 2020) and other overhead costs (Charkha and Jaju, 2014). Cost variance, lastly, includes risk (Bhagwat and Sharma, 2007b) and variations against budget (Sellitto et al., 2015).An example of the procedure followed for the classification of indicators is reported in detail for the performance area costs, that emerged as relevant for SC.

More in-depth, the following performance areas with the related performance were deemed as relevant for measuring sustainability in SCs, according to the review literature:</p>
        <p>-Economic and Finance. It measures the success of a firm's activities (Xu et al., 2016). The literature addressed this performance area considering market (Sangwan et al., 2019), financial performance (profitability) (Sopadang et al., 2017), economic performance (Hassini et al., 2012), context characteristics (Reefke and Trocchi, 2013) and corporate image (Subramanian and Gunasekaran, 2015). -Costs. It relates to the costs associated with the operating of a SC (Charkha and Jaju, 2014). As the costs considered in the literature are rather heterogeneous: they were analysed according to the direct/indirect classification (Xu et al., 2009), adding cost variance as a third performance (Bai et al., 2012). -Management. It plays a relevant role in the promotion (Gopal and Thakkar, 2016a;Marshall et al., 2015) and implementation (Luthra et al., 2018) of sustainability practices in a SC. The literature considered awareness (Hsu et al., 2011), procedures (Uysal, 2012), motivational effort (Olugu and Wong, 2012) and ethical conduct (Hsu et al., 2011). -Production. The production performance area is fundamental for properly manage SCs (Bhagwat and Sharma, 2007b), and, if shared across the SC, can lead to improved sustainability (He et al., 2019). Production performance area addresses production performance (Malviya and Kant, 2019), process (Charkha and Jaju, 2014), schedule (Sambasivan et al., 2009), Research and Development (R&amp;D) (Subramanian and Gunasekaran, 2015), Information Technology (IT) (Govindan et al., 2013) and production characteristics (Izadikhah and Saen, 2018). -Product. The product performance area is fundamental for properly manage SCs (Olugu and Wong, 2012), and, if shared across the SC, can lead to improved sustainability (He et al., 2019). For this performance area, product characteristics (Ahi and Searcy, 2015), defectiveness (Tajbakhsh and Hassini, 2015), innovation (Thakkar et al., 2009), design (Schaltegger and Burritt, 2014) and responsibility (Varsei et al., 2014) are underlined as relevant. -Quality. Quality refers to the standard of a product and service provided, linked to the customer satisfaction level and fitness to use (Chan, 2003;Charkha and Jaju, 2014).-Economic and Finance. It measures the success of a firm's activities (Xu et al., 2016). The literature addressed this performance area considering market (Sangwan et al., 2019), financial performance (profitability) (Sopadang et al., 2017), economic performance (Hassini et al., 2012), context characteristics (Reefke and Trocchi, 2013) and corporate image (Subramanian and Gunasekaran, 2015). -Costs.

Quality refers to the standard of a product and service provided, linked to the customer satisfaction level and fitness to use (Chan, 2003;Charkha and Jaju, 2014).</p>
        <p>The quality performance area is tackled focusing on purchase quality (Shafiee et al., 2014), product quality (Subramanian and Gunasekaran, 2015), returns service quality (Chia et al., 2009) and quality management (Sloan, 2010). -Flexibility. Flexibility refers to the ability of the SC to respond to market changes or to gain and maintain a competitive advantage (Supply Chain Council, 2012). The performance identified are production flexibility (Sufiyan et al., 2019), SC flexibility (Stefanović and Stefanović, 2011) and operation flexibility (Chan, 2003). -Inventory. Inventory in the SC ranges from raw materials to finished products (Shafiee et al., 2014). The effective management of inventory is critical, being related to customer service requirements (Bhagwat and Sharma, 2007b). The identified performance are inventory level (Sellitto et al., 2015), inventory coverage (Sambasivan et al., 2009), and inventory performance (Xu et al., 2016). -Information. It relates to the data and knowledge flowing along the tiers of a SC (Sambasivan et al., 2009). Performance considered by the literature refers to the extent of sharing of information (Susanty et al., 2019), and to their characteristics (Narimissa et al., 2020). -Order procedures and delivery. It relates to the soundness of order procedures and delivery (Bhagwat and Sharma, 2007b;Charkha and Jaju, 2014). This performance area addresses the order performance, invoice (Liebetruth, 2017), delivery performance (Büyüksaatçi Kiriş et al., 2020), timeliness of the delivery (Sopadang et al., 2017), and quality of the delivery (Chan, 2003). -Suppliers. Suppliers are a force acting towards improved sustainability (Carter and Dresner, 2001;Gopal and Thakkar, 2016a), both in individual firms and SCs (He et al., 2019). As supplier performance evaluation is not enough anymore and the partnership should be considered as well (Bhagwat and Sharma, 2007b), suppliers performance area can be then addressed considering dependency (Yakovleva et al., 2012), suppliers' performance (Schaltegger and Burritt, 2014), suppliers' collaboration (Sambasivan et al., 2009), SC characteristics (Said et al., 2020), and reverse SC (Erol et al., 2011). -Customers. Customers exert great pressure towards improved sustainability (Luthra et al., 2018) both in individual firms and SCs (He et al., 2019). The customer performance area includes satisfaction (Sopadang et al., 2017), service (Izadikhah and Saen, 2018) and characteristics (Baba et al., 2019). -SC response time. The SC response time performance area is influenced by the total order lead time -the time elapsing between the customer's order and delivery of the goods (Gunasekaran et al., 2001) -and the order cycle time plays a relevant role in it (Bhagwat and Sharma, 2007b). Shepherd and Günter (2006) linked it to the ability of a SC to deliver high customer service. The performance identified is related to cycle time (Gunasekaran et al., 2001) and lead time (Subramanian and Gunasekaran, 2015). -Environment. It assesses the environmental awareness of the SC (Sarkis and Dhavale, 2015). The environment performance area addresses resource consumption (Verdecho et al., 2020), recycling (Bhattacharya et al., 2014), emissions, waste (Chia et al., 2009), environmental management (Gopal and Thakkar, 2015), environmental cost (Ortas et al., 2014) and environmental ethical conduct (Izadikhah and Saen, 2018).The quality performance area is tackled focusing on purchase quality (Shafiee et al., 2014), product quality (Subramanian and Gunasekaran, 2015), returns service quality (Chia et al., 2009) and quality management (Sloan, 2010). -Flexibility.

        <p>-Social. It assesses the social consequences of the firm's activity on its stakeholders (Chardine-Baumann and Botta-Genoulaz, 2014). Social performance includes external stakeholders (Zailani et al., 2012), community (Faisal, 2012), employees (Popovic et al., 2018), social management (Stindt, 2017), social related cost (Subramanian and Gunasekaran, 2015) and ethical conduct (Hsu et al., 2011).-Social.

        <p>1. Holistic perspective on sustainability: literature contributions still do not provide a holistic and balanced perspective on the three TBL pillars (Taticchi et al., 2015;Xu et al., 2016) (see Table 2).  The economic pillar has been so far investigated more than the other two (Shepherd and Günter, 2006;Stindt, 2017), focusing particularly on the financial indicators (Chia et al., 2009). The environmental pillar has been largely investigated as well (Babu and Mohan, 2018), having acquired recently prominence with the concept of "green" SC (Marshall et al., 2015;Varsei et al., 2014). The social pillar is the weakest link of the chain, calling for additional research efforts (Cole and Aitken, 2019;Munny et al., 2019) that started to be carried out recently. These two specific insights can be appreciated in Table 4, with more detail provided in Appendix I.  Industrial sustainability-related literature largely underlined the necessity to address the pillars of sustainability in a holistic and integrated manner (Cagno et al., 2019). This aspect seems to be still absent in the specific SC discussion. Some contributions recently started investigating the relationships among different pillars (Macchion et al., 2017;Marshall et al., 2015), while also the impact of specific indicators on different pillars (Ahi and Searcy, 2015;Zailani et al., 2012). However, none develops a holistic and balanced perspective on sustainability, not accounting for intersections and interrelations among the different pillars (see Table 2).1.

        <p>The success of a strategy formulation depends on the alignment and balance of the operational, tactical and strategical decision levels (Gunasekaran et al., 2001;Gunasekaran and Kobu, 2007;Thakkar et al., 2009).The success of a strategy formulation depends on the alignment and balance of the operational, tactical and strategical decision levels (Gunasekaran et al., 2001;Gunasekaran and Kobu, 2007;Thakkar et al., 2009).</p>
        <p>The developed models for PIs, however, seem to lack a connection with a long-term strategy (Shepherd and Günter, 2006), as only a few contributions consider the different decision level (see Table 2). The lack of such an approach also negatively impacts on the addressing of a strong long-term sustainability perspective (Carter and Rogers, 2008;Morali and Searcy, 2013). 3. Balance of the performance indicators: the concept of balance is particularly relevant (Gunasekaran et al., 2001). Besides the abovementioned balance among TBL pillars and decision levels, models should consider the balance between financial and non-financial indicators and among the different SCOR processes and linked components of performance (Supply Chain Council, 2012). These aspects were already highlighted by Gunasekaran and Kobu (2007), and the review of the literature confirmed they are subsistent. Although balancing financial and non-financial indicators may help reach higher performance (Said et al., 2003) and an exclusive focus on financial indicators may produce a misleading picture of actual SC performance (Chen and Paulraj, 2004;Shepherd and Günter, 2006), many contributions have not considered this aspect as a base for the development models (see Table 2). As the balance among SCOR locations of measures and components of performance, could facilitate the integration of various functional areas within a SC (Kocaoǧlu et al., 2013), some contributions developed their proposal on the SCOR model (Hwang et al., 2008;Sellitto et al., 2015), but too many still do not (see Table 2). Lastly, interesting to note, none of the reviewed models was simultaneously covering all the performance areas identified from the literature, as it can be inferred by Table 4.The developed models for PIs, however, seem to lack a connection with a long-term strategy (Shepherd and Günter, 2006), as only a few contributions consider the different decision level (see Table 2).

        <p>indicators a model should entail (Searcy and Roca, 2012). As largely suggested, a model should propose a manageable number of indicators (Bhagwat and Sharma, 2009;Sambasivan et al., 2009), possibly allowing firms to start with a limited set of indicators, moving then to a larger one (Eckerson, 2009;Searcy and Ahi, 2014), as too many indicators could distract from pursuing a focused strategy (Epstein and Widener, 2010).indicators a model should entail (Searcy and Roca, 2012).

        <p>There is no agreement in the literature about the threshold number of the "trivial few" (Thakkar et al., 2009) -see (Collins et al., 2016;Krajnc and Glavič, 2003;Siskos, 2014): trade-off arises then between an outright view of sustainability performancefor which a considerable amount of indicators is required, and the slenderness of the decision-making process (Gunasekaran et al., 2001;Medini et al., 2015) -maximum effectiveness and minimum operating cost (Gunasekaran and Kobu, 2007). For the analysed contributions PIs range from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 159 (see Table 2). The issue of the number of indicators becomes even more crucial by considering the massive presence of SMEs within SCs (Faisal, 2012), usually typified by limited available of resources (as, money, staff and time) to measure performance in an appropriate and effective manner (Borga et al., 2009). 5. Focus on the overall SC: contributions are still way too much focused on local optimization (mainly addressing focal firm), rather than on the optimization of the entire SC (Masi et al., 2018), which should also comprehend a multi-tier perspective (Maestrini et al., 2017), leading to the still open point on how the indicators should be measured along the SC (Qorri et al., 2018). As an example, the routing flexibility PI (Chan, 2003) proposes a local and internal optimization, rather than a systemwide one (Lambert and Pohlen, 2001;Taticchi et al., 2013). Despite the ambitious objective of almost all contributions to assess the performance of the overall SC, the empirical applications are still conducted from the perspective of focal firms, not clearly discussing how to apply the proposed PIs along the overall SC (see Table 3). Some authors, however, provide some first example, as Chia et al. (2009) through the application of the same BSC to all the tiers of a SC, or Sellitto et al. (2015) analysing three-tiers of a SC, although proposing specific PIs to each tier (see Table 3). 6. Appropriate for application in different contexts: too little attention has been paid so far on developing a model of PIs applicable in different contexts. Indeed, as many models were developed for a general context, their validation or application took place in limited and specific ones, as Sangwan et al. (2019) (see Table 3). Such model of PIs would allow for a cross-sectoral analysis with a side policy-making purposes, considering the great heterogeneity of SCs in different sectors, geographical locations and firm sizes (Grimm et al., 2014;Plambeck, 2012;Sarkis, 2012).There is no agreement in the literature about the threshold number of the "trivial few" (Thakkar et al., 2009) -see (Collins et al., 2016;Krajnc and Glavič, 2003;Siskos, 2014): trade-off arises then between an outright view of sustainability performancefor which a considerable amount of indicators is required, and the slenderness of the decision-making process (Gunasekaran et al., 2001;Medini et al., 2015) -maximum effectiveness and minimum operating cost (Gunasekaran and Kobu, 2007).

        <p>The rationale for the development of the proposed set of KPIs was based on two steps: first, the identification of an appropriate structure for the set; second, the definition of a method for the identification and selection of the most appropriate KPIs to be included in the set.

As for the empirical validation, we assured to cover, from a literature perspective, the gaps identified after the literature review; this process goes hand in hand with the identification and selection of the most appropriate KPIs to be included in the set. By taking inspiration from previous literature (Voss et al., 2002), we then assessed the capability of the set to survive the test of empirical data and real-cases confrontation.

        <p>The BSC is largely recognized as a management system facilitating the implementation of a strategy (Beske-Janssen et al., 2015;Hoque, 2014); as it goes beyond the traditional accounting system (Reefke and Trocchi, 2013), also considering non-financial aspects, it maintains a balance between short and long-term objectives (Bhagwat and Sharma, 2007b;Shafiee et al., 2014). The traditional Kaplan and Norton (1992)'s BSC is organized around four perspectives, namely: Financial, Customer, Internal processes, Learning and growth (Bigliardi and Bottani, 2010;Shafiee et al., 2014). As sustainability started to be incorporated in management tools, three different approaches were discussed for framing sustainability within the BSC (Hsu et al., 2011): incorporate environmental and social aspects within the already present perspectives (Ferreira et al., 2016); add a fifth non-market aspects related perspective (Reefke and Trocchi, 2013); add fifth and sixth perspectives related to social and environmental aspects (Verdecho et al., 2012). As the inclusion of environmental and social aspects in the traditional four perspectives may not sufficiently represent them (Reefke and Trocchi, 2013), the latter approach is deemed suitable for strategically coordinating and controlling relevant environmental and social aspects (Figge et al., 2002). Traditionally developed to be applied in firms, the BSC can also provide foundations for a strategic SC management system (Bhagwat and Sharma, 2007b). To include considerations of SC management, aspects related to coordination, instructional and partnership have been included in the BSC (Brewer and Speh, 2000;Liebetruth, 2017;Verdecho et al., 2012), or the same BSC had been applied to different entities of the SC (Chia et al., 2009), but the need for an adaptation of the traditional perspectives to apply the BSC at a SC decision level is still vivid (Liebetruth, 2017;Reefke and Trocchi, 2013).The BSC is largely recognized as a management system facilitating the implementation of a strategy (Beske-Janssen et al., 2015;Hoque, 2014); as it goes beyond the traditional accounting system (Reefke and Trocchi, 2013), also considering non-financial aspects, it maintains a balance between short and long-term objectives (Bhagwat and Sharma, 2007b;Shafiee et al., 2014).

        <p>The SCOR model, on the other side, is a standard framework enabling effective and collaborative SC management (Gulledge and Chavusholu, 2008) along the SC activities (Sellitto et al., 2015). The SCOR model indeed considers five business process types -Plan, Source, Make, Deliver and Return, while also addressing five strategic SC performancetraditionally Reliability, Responsiveness, Flexibility, Cost and Asset (Supply Chain Council, 2012), then adapted by specific contributions (Bai et al., 2012). Despite the SCOR importance for achieving operational improvements, it is not appropriate for the development of a comprehensive operations strategy, aligned with the firm's overall strategy (Stewart, 1997).The SCOR model, on the other side, is a standard framework enabling effective and collaborative SC management (Gulledge and Chavusholu, 2008) along the SC activities (Sellitto et al., 2015).

        <p>A combined framework could help to focus on a long-term SC strategy, seeking a two-fold aim: due to the SCOR foundation, it is a structured framework able to cover the entire SC (Balfaqih et al., 2016b); due to its BSC structure, it can align strategy and performance (Brewer and Speh, 2000), while also providing a balanced approach to the TBL pillars (Eskafi et al., 2015) see (Epstein and Roy, 2003;Figge et al., 2002;Sloan, 2010).A combined framework could help to focus on a long-term SC strategy, seeking a two-fold aim: due to the SCOR foundation, it is a structured framework able to cover the entire SC (Balfaqih et al., 2016b); due to its BSC structure, it can align strategy and performance (Brewer and Speh, 2000), while also providing a balanced approach to the TBL pillars (Eskafi et al., 2015) see (Epstein and Roy, 2003;Figge et al., 2002;Sloan, 2010).</p>
        <p>An open issue still needs to be tackled as BSC and SCOR were mainly developed for use in medium and large firms, not taking into consideration the specific needs of smaller enterprises (Thakkar et al., 2009). Perforce, the set of KPIs should be simple to understand and easy to use, focusing on few but critical indicators (Chia et al., 2009;Thakkar et al., 2009). As previous literature suggests from 5 (Collins et al., 2016;Krajnc and Glavič, 2003) up to 60 (Globerson, 1985) indicators as the right number of PIs a model should entail, we deem a number between 20 and 40 to be an appropriate one, relying on the theoretical and empirical insights by Cagno et al. (2019) and Trianni et al. (2019).An open issue still needs to be tackled as BSC and SCOR were mainly developed for use in medium and large firms, not taking into consideration the specific needs of smaller enterprises (Thakkar et al., 2009).

        <p>Identified the frame for the set, we proceeded to the selection of KPIs to include, so to provide a handy set of indicators, i.e. straightforward, easy-to-use and communicable (Faisal, 2012;Thakkar et al., 2009), while also covering the identified gaps. In doing so, we relied on Gunasekaran and Kobu (2007) for their structured and broadly valued approach (Ahi and Searcy, 2015;Balfaqih et al., 2016b;Taticchi et al., 2015), adding the environmental and social PIs emerged from the literature. Furthermore, during the overall selection process, we also considered the suggestions by Chia et al. (2009) and Reefke and Trocchi (2013) for the development of indicators for sustainability in SCs.Identified the frame for the set, we proceeded to the selection of KPIs to include, so to provide a handy set of indicators, i.e. straightforward, easy-to-use and communicable (Faisal, 2012;Thakkar et al., 2009), while also covering the identified gaps.

        <p>The rationale for the selection of indicators to include was based on different but parallel reasonings: (i). We considered as a proxy of relevance the frequency of occurrence in the literature (Cagno et al., 2019;Veleva and Ellenbecker, 2001) and the prioritisation of indicators performed by several authors -please consider, for example (Aramyan et al., 2007;Chia et al., 2009;Stindt, 2017) -thus focusing on indicators acknowledged by previous literature as the most relevant ones (Ahi and Searcy, 2015). (ii).We addressed the gaps that emerged from the conducted revision of the literature, particularly: a. To tackle the SC in the overall, as abovementioned, we considered the traditional SCOR processes, namely plan, source, make, deliver and return (Chehbi-Gamoura et al., 2019;Supply Chain Council, 2012), deeming a KPI able to foster integration and cooperation along the entire SC if able to cover more than one process, while also focusing on the coverage of the components of performance, namely time, cost, quality, flexibility and asset (Bai et al., 2012;Shepherd and Günter, 2006). b. To provide a balanced set of KPIs, we focused on the coverage of (b 1 ) the three TBL pillars and their intersections (Cagno et al., 2019;Trianni et al., 2017); (b 2 ) the different decision levels (Björklund et al., 2012); (b 3 ) and the diverse financial bases (Gopal and Thakkar, 2016b). During the selection, we acknowledged that an indicator can be related to more than one SCOR process, components of performance, TBL pillar, decision level or financial base.The rationale for the selection of indicators to include was based on different but parallel reasonings: (i).

        <p>An example is here reported for the selection of the KPIs Inventory cost. (i). Selection of relevant indicators. Firstly, the literature reviewed allowed (see Table 2) to identify and retrieve 28 different performance measures related to inventory management (see Table 2). Among these performance measures, the most frequent one is Inventory cost. We pigeonholed the 28 performance measures according to 21 PIs. Among these, Inventory cost remains the most frequently cited. We also reorganized the 21 PIs in 3 performance, namely Inventory cost, Inventory level and Inventory performance. Among the three performance, since Inventory cost is still the most frequently cited, we thus deemed it to be a proper KPI for the proposed set. The steps and related details for the selection of the KPI are reported in Table 5. Secondly, we sought confirmation of our selection in previous literature: in this case, Gunasekaran et al. (2001) deemed Inventory cost as a KPI of fundamental importance to evaluate the cost associated with the inventory. Additionally, we also found confirmation of this in grey and industry-related literature (Kaçan, 2019;Stackpole, 2020). (ii). Addressing of the literature gaps. We considered the capability of the selected KPI to cover the performance and performance areas presented in Section 2.2 (Table 4). The Inventory Cost KPI results able to cover the performance Direct cost; Inventory level; Inventory performance and the performance areas Cost and Inventory. This procedure is crucial to evaluate the coverage of the Inventory Cost KPI concerning the SCOR process and components of performance, as well as to identify which sustainability pillar in the TBL is most addressed by the KPI. In this case, Inventory cost is relevant in all the SCOR processes (Bigliardi and Bottani, 2010). Notably, addressing both the cost and flexibility components of performance (Gunasekaran and Kobu, 2007;Sellitto et al., 2015), it can impact the financial (Hadiguna et al., 2011), internal process (Shafiee et al., 2014) and learning and growth (Eskafi et al., 2015) BSC's perspectives. When considering sustainability pillars, Inventory cost is largely targeted as a financial indicator (Bhagwat and Sharma, 2007b). As a general KPI, more detailed aspects can be evaluated by focusing on specific inventories (Gunasekaran et al., 2001) -as raw material, finished goods of WIP (Shafiee et al., 2014), on the obsolescence cost (Gunasekaran and Kobu, 2007), and on costs related to the control of inventory (Shepherd and Günter, 2006), given the service level (Giannakis and Papadopoulos, 2016). The KPI straightforwardly affects the TBL's economic dimension (Xu et al., 2016), but can also impact the environmental one, as better inventory management could lead to lower space utilisation, emissions and waste level (Stindt, 2017;Xia and Li-Ping Tang, 2011). Finally, authors also noted that Inventory cost spans from the strategical to the operational decision levels (Liebetruth, 2017;Subramanian and Gunasekaran, 2015). (Baba et al., 2019;Bai et al., 2012;Bhagwat and Sharma, 2007b;Bigliardi and Bottani, 2010;Chan, 2003;Charkha andJaju, 2015, 2014;Eskafi et al., 2015;Faisal, 2012;Gunasekaran and Kobu, 2007;Liebetruth, 2017;Mishra and Sharma, 2014;Narimissa et al., 2020;Olugu and Wong, 2012;Sambasivan et al., 2009;Shafiee et al., 2014;Shepherd and Günter, 2006;Subramanian and Gunasekaran, 2015) 26.1% 58.1%An example is here reported for the selection of the KPIs Inventory cost.

        <p>After the theoretical validation, we have assessed the proposed set of KPIs against its capability of addressing sustainability within a whole SC and its applicability in SCs with different characteristics. The aim was to understand whether the theoretically developed set of KPIs was also effectively helpful and adequate for an empirical application (Denzin and Lincoln, 2011;Ketokivi and Choi, 2014). Particularly, the set of KPIs was tested for its: (i) capability to representadequately taking into consideration all the PIs addressing sustainability in a SC; (ii) usefulness -being meaningful if applied; and (iii) ease of useevaluating the effort (resources and possible difficulties) required for the application of the set.After the theoretical validation, we have assessed the proposed set of KPIs against its capability of addressing sustainability within a whole SC and its applicability in SCs with different characteristics.

        <p>As multiple case studies are recommended for theory testing purposes (Voss et al., 2002), the overall sample investigated includes 3 SCs -2 three-tiers and one dyadic -and 7 focal firms, for a total of 15 firms. Indeed, the perspective of the investigation is two-fold: on the one hand, we aim to evaluate the applicability of the proposed set of KPIs on the whole SC -thus on all the firms within a SC; on the other hand, we required a response by focal firms on the views of their suppliers on the proposed set of KPIs.As multiple case studies are recommended for theory testing purposes (Voss et al., 2002), the overall sample investigated includes 3 SCs -2 three-tiers and one dyadic -and 7 focal firms, for a total of 15 firms.

        <p>Each case study has then been treated and examined as a single case (Handfield and Melnyk, 1998;Voss et al., 2002). The level of investigation adopted is the single firm, belonging to the manufacturing sector, located in Italy. We thus focused on a sample heterogeneous by activity and size, but alike as for country (Morioka and Carvalho, 2014;Osagie et al., 2016), as reported in Table 6. Our sample finds justification as: on the one hand, Northern Italy is a strongly industrialised Italian region, particularly relevant for the European manufacturing sector (European Commission, 2018;Eurostat, 2018); on the other hand, the possibility for the manufacturing sector to improve and enhance its industrial sustainability-related performance is largely highlighted (European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, 2009;European Commission, 2017;Meng et al., 2018). We selected the firms from "AIDA" (https://aida.bvdinfo.com/), a database displaying containing Italian firms' information according to the EU's industrial activities classification (European Commission, 2008). About two-thirds of the firms contacted accepted to take part in the research (Firms A2, B2, C2, D, E, F, G, H, I, J). We asked these firms to extend the invitation to members of their SC. Firms A2, B2 and C2 accepted the request, and other 5 firms were included in the sample investigated, allowing for 3 SCs and 7 single firms. The final sample includes therefore 15 firms. The size of the sample is judged adequate for the aim of the empirical validation with a replication logic (Meredith and Vineyard, 1993;Voss et al., 2002). Moreover, a less qualitative description may be involved, with a relatively slight narrative for all sites, but a more thorough depiction for a few cases (Meredith and Vineyard, 1993). The collection of both primary and secondary the data relied on five different sources of evidence, detailed in Appendix II.Each case study has then been treated and examined as a single case (Handfield and Melnyk, 1998;Voss et al., 2002).

We selected the firms from "AIDA" (https://aida.bvdinfo.com/), a database displaying containing Italian firms' information according to the EU's industrial activities classification (European Commission, 2008). About two-thirds of the firms contacted accepted to take part in the research (Firms A2, B2, C2, D, E, F, G, H, I, J). We asked these firms to extend the invitation to members of their SC. Firms A2, B2 and C2 accepted the request, and other 5 firms were included in the sample investigated, allowing for 3 SCs and 7 single firms. The final sample includes therefore 15 firms. The size of the sample is judged adequate for the aim of the empirical validation with a replication logic (Meredith and Vineyard, 1993;Voss et al., 2002). Moreover, a less qualitative description may be involved, with a relatively slight narrative for all sites, but a more thorough depiction for a few cases (Meredith and Vineyard, 1993). The collection of both primary and secondary the data relied on five different sources of evidence, detailed in Appendix II.</p>
        <p>For the 15 firms participating, we collected secondary data on firms' structure and processes, as well as reports, projects, initiatives and similar related to sustainability. The source of primary data is the investigation within the firms. As the main source of data in the present research comes from the investigation, we have selected as interviewees industrial decision-makers knowledgeable of aspects related to sustainability and all the processes of the firm (Meredith and Vineyard, 1993). The investigation within the firms took place with the use of semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire, using a protocol as a guide (Patton, 1990) while also collecting any further comments emerging during the interview (Dicicco- Bloom and Crabtree, 2006). We have divided the investigation into two parts, lasting a total of 2 hours on average. In the first part, employing semi-structured interviews, interviewees were asked to describe the firm in terms of the sector, production processes, the number of employees, SC characteristics and attitude towards sustainability. Interviewees were asked to focus their attention on the sustainability of the SC and to identify the KPIs currently used for evaluation of SC performance within their SC. To facilitate this process, we asked the interviewees to recall recent sustainability interventions implemented within their firms and within the SC, and to focus on the performance reached and measured after the implementation in the overall SC. In the second part of the investigation, employing a questionnaire, we introduced the set of KPIs to interviewees, describing each single KPI, asking them to evaluate the set with the help of a questionnaire based on a 3-points Likertlike scale. As a part of the investigation, the interviewers involved also visited the production plant to directly observe and better understand the context under investigation and took field notes.For the 15 firms participating, we collected secondary data on firms' structure and processes, as well as reports, projects, initiatives and similar related to sustainability.

        <p>We transcribed the interviews promptly after the investigation, so to maximise recall (Voss et al., 2002). We analysed the data using a content analysis approach. The transcriptions were independently coded manually by the investigators and the results were then discussed together reaching a common understanding of them. We adopted an emergent coding, developing categories based on the research questions (Kohlbacher, 2006;Kolbe and Burnett, 1991). Detailed, we applied a Structural code, appropriate for semi-structured interviews (Saldaña, 2009), succeeded by an Axial code, relating codes to each other (Voss et al., 2002). The analysis conducted for SC A and SC B is reported in Appendix III, by way of example. We corroborated the information obtained through the different sources and in case of misalignments we requested a second meeting with the interviewees for additional clarification.We transcribed the interviews promptly after the investigation, so to maximise recall (Voss et al., 2002).

        <p>The final set proposes 33 KPIs, organized according to six perspectives. Based on the considerations in Section 3.1.1, we adopted a six perspectives BSC: to the traditional Financial, Internal process, Learning and Growth, Customer perspectives (Bigliardi and Bottani, 2010;Shafiee et al., 2014), we added Environment and Social perspectives (Figge et al., 2002;Verdecho et al., 2012). The KPIs are selected according to the rationale discussed in Section 3.1.2. In the following, we offer an overview of the six perspectives and the 33 KPIs, whilst further details related to the selection of each specific KPIs are reported in Appendix IV.The final set proposes 33 KPIs, organized according to six perspectives.

        <p>The results of the empirical evaluation of the proposed set of KPIs are reported in Table 9. Regarding capability to represent, notably, the completeness of the set was largely confirmed, focusing in particular on the integration of the TBL pillars. Regarding the distinction among the proposed KPIs, the interviewees spotted no overlapping, also meaning the interviewees identified a practical application for all the KPIs. A2 and A3 lie in the small set of firms that partially disagreed. The Production Manager of A2, during the investigation, underlined that they often perceived logistics to be one of the most important aspects for a SC, given also the high number of suppliers and customers of A2. Since, as they stated, "the first point is to find suppliers as close as possible", distribution is considered notably important for the development of sustainability in a SC, while other aspects are left behind as "I can't tell you about social aspects: there are more stringent issues". The same reasoning can be applied to A3, whose Managing Director perceived SC sustainability as being related mainly to lead time and quality.The results of the empirical evaluation of the proposed set of KPIs are reported in Table 9.

        <p>Focusing on usefulness, the overall results were positive. Some interviewees seemed to be aware of (some of) the proposed KPIs, but, as a shared opinion, the model helped them to better reorganise what they had already in mind, while also being a valid and quick help for the evaluation of the sustainability performance of the SC. Particularly, the Plant Manager of C2 recognised the proposed set of KPIs as a useful instrument to align each tier within the SC, adding that: "if a SC is aligned, the performance of every tier improves, and, as a consequence, the performance of the overall SC improves". The Commercial Manager of Firm D and the Coowner of Firm E also pinpointed this aspect. Both, indeed, deemed the improvement in the performance of one tier to bring about benefits overall, but "there is the need for perfect alignment in terms of actions and evaluation of effects" (Co-owner, Firm E). Some interviewees stated they were already aware of the proposed KPIs: this does not represent a flaw of the study since we did not aim to identify new KPIs but rather to reorganise in a balanced manner the PIs already available. We expected more proactive or sustainability-aware firms to have a broad knowledge of the topic. This turned out to be correct as firms B2 and D, both holding quality and environmental certifications, had a proper perspective on sustainability -"[sustainability] is the necessity, for all the tiers, to broadcast the message that sustainable means to keep the same performance [price and quality], having a more ethical perspective" (Commercial Manager of D); "Sustainabilit is something for rich: first of all ou need the economic availabilit , after that, ou need foresight […] it would be good to extend the [sustainability time] horizon because it would allow taking completel different decisions"(Health Safety and Environment Manager of B2) -and considered various SC PIs, spanning among the different pillars, also addressing Safety and Environment performance areas.Focusing on usefulness, the overall results were positive.

        <p>Ease of use was confirmed by the vast majority of interviewees. The few deeming the model a bit complex, offered nonetheless a positive evaluation, pinpointing its worth of use. Notably, the interviewees seemed to appreciate the low number of KPIs, as underlined by the Plant Manager of C2, as: "it is very important to select manageable performance indicators, so to check them steadfastl ". Moreover, the interviewees showed interest in the possible use of the set during the decision-making process, so to help them in evaluating possible measures and practices to be adopted.Ease of use was confirmed by the vast majority of interviewees.

        <p>The present section discusses the set of KPIs proposed with respect to the research gaps addressed in the present work, in light of both theoretical and empirical validation. First, from a theoretical perspective, a major challenge and element of novelty was represented by the need to encompass the previous literature with the newly proposed set of KPIs. We can see that the selected KPIs cover all the performance areas, the performance and related indicators identified in the prior literature. Focusing on previous literature (see Table 4) any contribution was covering all the performance areas identified in the literature, for example, Marconi et al. (2017) focused almost exclusively only on Product, Production and Environmental areas; Chardine-Baumann and Botta-Genoulaz ( 2014) spanned on all the performance areas identified, but missed aspects related to Orders procedures and delivery. Looking at the specific KPIs encompassed in the present set, not all the previous contributions were considering them, despite their relevance (see Table 8 and Appendix I for details), for example, ROI was not considered by Narimissa et al. (2020), who however provided quite a numerous set of indicators; Inventory Cost, whose importance has been underlined in Section 3.1, is not mentioned by Ferreira et al. (2016), who nonetheless recommended a strategyoriented approach based on BSC; Waste, a fundamental aspect of the environmental pillar of the TBL, is not directly tackled by Verdecho et al. (2020) despite the focused on a TBL perspective; Employees' satisfaction, strongly related to customer satisfaction and operational performance Fernández-Muñiz et al. ( 2012) is not addressed by Said et al. (2020) who focused mainly in Social and Environmental aspects.The present section discusses the set of KPIs proposed with respect to the research gaps addressed in the present work, in light of both theoretical and empirical validation.

Focusing on previous literature (see Table 4) any contribution was covering all the performance areas identified in the literature, for example, Marconi et al. (2017) focused almost exclusively only on Product, Production and Environmental areas; Chardine-Baumann and Botta-Genoulaz ( 2014) spanned on all the performance areas identified, but missed aspects related to Orders procedures and delivery. Looking at the specific KPIs encompassed in the present set, not all the previous contributions were considering them, despite their relevance (see Table 8 and Appendix I for details), for example, ROI was not considered by Narimissa et al. (2020), who however provided quite a numerous set of indicators; Inventory Cost, whose importance has been underlined in Section 3.1, is not mentioned by Ferreira et al. (2016), who nonetheless recommended a strategyoriented approach based on BSC; Waste, a fundamental aspect of the environmental pillar of the TBL, is not directly tackled by Verdecho et al. (2020) despite the focused on a TBL perspective; Employees' satisfaction, strongly related to customer satisfaction and operational performance Fernández-Muñiz et al. ( 2012) is not addressed by Said et al. (2020) who focused mainly in Social and Environmental aspects.</p>
        <p>Second, the set of KPIs has been assessed against its capability to effectively measure sustainability issues according to the TBL pillars without the common unbalance towards economic (or financial) issues, thus neglecting the environmental and social dimensions. In this regard, the proposed encompasses 8 financial based KPIs, e.g. ROA (Xu et al., 2016), with 18 non-financial based KPIs, e.g., labour efficiency (Gunasekaran and Kobu, 2007), plus 6 KPIs that can are not economic/financial but have of course economic/financial implications such as e.g., deliver reliability (Gunasekaran et al., 2001). By a closer look to the TBL pillars, 14 out of 33 KPIs address all the three of them, thus in line with remarks of previous literature about the need to focus on the intersection of all pillars (Biely et al., 2018;Mulia et al., 2016). Another 14 address the socio-economic and economic-environmental pillars, whilst only 5 are focused exclusively on the economic pillar. As several of the previous contributions address sustainability according to the TBL concept, to our knowledge any of them evaluated the balance of the proposed set in terms of TBL pillars and above all in terms of TBL pillars' intersections (see Table 2). Three contributions, however, started moving in this direction, still showing some limitations as for the area of interest of the present study: Faisal (2012) proposed a theoretical methodology for evaluating the relationship among different variables of sustainability; Zailani et al. (2012) applied factor analysis to understand the outcomes related to specific and limited in number performance-for example, they do not consider employees' related performance; Ahi and Searcy (2015) evaluated the impact of specific indicators on the three pillars of the TBL, yet indicators are provided without a categorization and mainly address environmental aspects.Second, the set of KPIs has been assessed against its capability to effectively measure sustainability issues according to the TBL pillars without the common unbalance towards economic (or financial) issues, thus neglecting the environmental and social dimensions.

        <p>Third, in response to previous studies (Ahi and Searcy, 2015;Searcy and Ahi, 2014), the limited number of selected KPIs represents a major strength of the present set, as also appreciated during the empirical investigation. The importance of a limited number of indicators has been remarked by extant research (Isaksson and Garvare, 2003;Vanleer et al., 2016), and could result particularly useful when applied to firms with limited resources to be devoted to measuring sustainability performance and managing related issues (Borga et al., 2009;Tremblay and Badri, 2018). By having a manageable number of indicators (Epstein and Widener, 2010;Medini et al., 2015), enterprises and SCs can effectively measure the overall sustainability performance, still capturing relevant operational elements and viable for empirical application. The present study, by presenting this set of KPIs, seems to allow overcoming the issues emerged in previous approaches, as for example the ones by Sambasivan et al. (2009) and Sangwan et al. (2019), either too broad or too burdensome for companies and SCs, either lacking the operational dimension, or too onerous for an effective deployment on the field. Furthermore, contributions focused on TBL and entailing around 30 indicators, do not covered all the performance areas, as Sopadang et al. (2017), Susanty et al. (2019) and Xu et al. (2016).Third, in response to previous studies (Ahi and Searcy, 2015;Searcy and Ahi, 2014), the limited number of selected KPIs represents a major strength of the present set, as also appreciated during the empirical investigation. The importance of a limited number of indicators has been remarked by extant research (Isaksson and Garvare, 2003;Vanleer et al., 2016), and could result particularly useful when applied to firms with limited resources to be devoted to measuring sustainability performance and managing related issues (Borga et al., 2009;Tremblay and Badri, 2018).

Furthermore, contributions focused on TBL and entailing around 30 indicators, do not covered all the performance areas, as Sopadang et al. (2017), Susanty et al. (2019) and Xu et al. (2016).</p>
        <p>Moreover, the proposed set presents a strong integration between three different decision-making levels, (i.e., strategical, tactical and operational), with about two-thirds of KPIs addressing the strategical decision level that can be turned into tactical and operational decisions. Such capability of entailing a long-term orientation about sustainability is deemed as crucial by previous studies (Carter and Rogers, 2008;Morali and Searcy, 2013). Additionally, the proposed set of KPIs is meant to offer a guideline of the most important ones to be considered but could always be complemented by more specific ones tailored to the unique needs of their own SC. Furthermore, the proposed set considers in the development and consequently offers an appropriate balance of the different SCOR processes and components of performance, as well as a balance and integration of the different BSC's perspectives. As for the abovementioned features, the set of indicators proposed by Gunasekaran and Kobu (2007) is undoubtedly the most detailed one, nevertheless, it does not focus on sustainability. Contributions focusing on sustainability, on the other hand, do not make the same considerations. For example, Liebetruth (2017) and Baba et al. (2019) only focused on decision levels, Büyüksaatçi Kiriş et al. ( 2020) only on the SCOR processes, Verdecho et al. (2020) only on the BSC perspectives.Moreover, the proposed set presents a strong integration between three different decision-making levels, (i.e., strategical, tactical and operational), with about two-thirds of KPIs addressing the strategical decision level that can be turned into tactical and operational decisions.

        <p>The empirical investigation allowed us to further corroborate the judgments about the completeness of the proposed set of KPIs. The details of this analysis are reported in Table 10. All the PIs listed by the firms were considered in the proposed set, or easily attributable to them, as Sales Growth PI, ascribable within the KPI Market share (see also Appendix IV). Although some indicators were not considered by the interviewees, the obtained overlap is significant. KPIs related to economic aspects appear to be the most considered, while environmental indicators are mainly related to emissions, and social ones to the relationship with the community, confirming Henri and Journeault (2008) and Pawłowska (2015). Notably, PIs like energy use or OHS are largely diffuse among firms (Trianni et al., 2019) but the same cannot be directly applied to SCs, as already noticed by Marshall et al. (2016). Some indicators related to Cost evaluation were not considered either, regardless of their proven importance in the literature (see Table 8) as the Total SC costs or Investments. The findings support the results of Vuorenmaa and Helo (2011) and Pettersson and Segerstedt (2013), also considering the highly confidential data that would need to be shared (Pagell and Shevchenko, 2014;Patrucco et al., 2019). Our set is contributing to this direction, helping SCs in identifying the sustainability KPIs to be collectively addressed, allowing for independent and autonomous management of the issues by each tier (Sisco and Chorn, 2009). According to this preliminary empirical validation, the proposed set of KPIs seems to be applicable in different contexts, according to diverse firm size and sector, following the advice from Ahi and Searcy (2015). Moreover, as per the feedbacks from interviewees, the proposed set looked manageable and easy to be used: this result seems positive, although preliminary and with more empirical research needed, considering the share of SMEs in the investigated sample (Arena and Azzone, 2012). The applicability along the entire SC was confirmed by investigating 3 SCs and by asking focal firms to consider their extended SC. This approach can provide better results than investigating only the perspectives focal firms, as largely recommended (Ahi and Searcy, 2015;Winter et al., 2013) and recently remarked (Tuni et al., 2018). As for the previous literature, not many applications exist along the entire SC in different sectors. Authors started moving in this direction, still the contributions show limitations as for the scope of the present study: Lauras et al. (2011) did not specifically address sustainability and focused only on the make SCOR process; Izadikhah and Saen (2018) entailed a limited number of indicator for a specific sector and country; Sellitto et al. (2015) and Tajbakhsh and Hassini (2015) both addressed a specific sector and suggested the use of specific indicators for each tier, thus not considering a general set applicable in all the tiers, as suggested by Ahi and Searcy (2015) and Aramyan et al. (2007).The empirical investigation allowed us to further corroborate the judgments about the completeness of the proposed set of KPIs. The details of this analysis are reported in Table 10.

        <p>The growing pressures experienced by SCs to address sustainability and the need for a balanced, holistic and integrated set of KPIs for measuring sustainability represent a crucial aspect that we wanted to tackle. We deem the proposed set of KPIs to successfully contribute to the discourse over the measurement of sustainability in firms and SCs.The growing pressures experienced by SCs to address sustainability and the need for a balanced, holistic and integrated set of KPIs for measuring sustainability represent a crucial aspect that we wanted to tackle.

        <p>From an academic perspective, the proposed set offers a balanced set of specific KPIs prioritized looking at the overall SC and not only from the perspective of the focal firm, and consolidated through an application in different real-world contexts involving industrial decision-makers. To our knowledge, as can be inferred by the conducted literature review, the present work provides a relevant advancement in the literature. As for the industry side, industrial decision-makers are provided with a set of KPIs for a comprehensive assessment of sustainability performance in SCs. This allows for a more focused and general approach along all the SC tiers, allowing a better grasping what actions could be undertaken to enhance sustainability performance. From a policy-making perspective, the set could also support policy-makers in developing more effective regulation and policy frameworks for sustainability, further encouraging firms and SCs towards improved sustainability, also considering the Sustainable Development Goals.From an academic perspective, the proposed set offers a balanced set of specific KPIs prioritized looking at the overall SC and not only from the perspective of the focal firm, and consolidated through an application in different real-world contexts involving industrial decision-makers.

        <p>In conclusion, we would like to acknowledge some caveats and limitations. When conducting case studies, interviewees of the different firms and SCs were not in the same managerial position. Further, we could not interview multiple industrial decision-makers within the same firm, thus being unable to simultaneously gather multiple views and opinions within the same firm. Albeit the empirical validation was conducted in a relevant European economy, it is not representative of all manufacturing economies, and therefore slight differences could be experienced.In conclusion, we would like to acknowledge some caveats and limitations.

        <p>Nevertheless, the aforementioned limitations offer interesting opportunities for future studies, and we would like to conclude by sketching some research avenues. First, further empirical research could consider the perspectives of multiple industrial decision-makers differently acknowledgeable for sustainability, allowing a better understanding of possible mismatches and conflicting perspectives. Second, although the sample size of our empirical validation is adequate for theoretical generalizability, statistical one would require further research. Third, future work could explore different contexts more in detail, considering SC sector, geographic location, length and characteristics, as well as leverage on longitudinal research, evaluating the evolution over time of firms and SCs. Our investigation revealed that some contextual variables seem to hinder or foster an integrated approach of the SC towards increased sustainabilityas the degree of alignment -calling for further research on them to better understanding the decision-making process. As for additional stream of research, in our study, we could grasp a thorough relationship between sustainability-oriented and quality management-oriented SC literature, calling for additional research on the topic. Others interesting aspects seem to be then related to the quantitative evaluation of PIs and to the computation of the PIs along the whole SC. All these insights would provide strong support for the measurement of sustainability performance in SCs.Nevertheless, the aforementioned limitations offer interesting opportunities for future studies, and we would like to conclude by sketching some research avenues.
