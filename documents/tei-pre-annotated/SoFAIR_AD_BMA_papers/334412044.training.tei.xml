        <p>In many professional situations, experts are confronted with a given set of alternatives that they need to choose from, for example when selecting a supplier or a technology. This type of decision-making problem is intuitive when considering a single criterion, since experts can choose the alternative of the highest preference. It becomes complicated when there are multiple criteria. These criteria are often not of equal importance and the alternatives have very varied performance. Formal methods are needed to ensure a structured means of making decisions. Many methods are available such as Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) (see Chai et al. (2013), Karsak and Dursun (2016) and Zimmer et al. (2016) for an overview of available decision-making methods). Among them, AHP proposed by Saaty (1980) has been applied extensively to evaluate complex multi-criteria alternatives in a number of fields (Subramanian &amp; Ramanathan, 2012;Emrouznejad &amp; Marra, 2017). It outperforms by ease of use, structuring problems systematically and calculating both criteria weights and alternative priorities. As a popular methodology for handling imprecision, fuzzy sets proposed by Zadeh (1965) are combined with AHP, namely fuzzy AHP or FAHP. This integrated method maintains the advantage of AHP and has been widely applied (Mardani et al., 2015). The procedure of building a fuzzy AHP model follows establishing the comparison matrix, aggregating multiple judgements, measuring the consistency and defuzzifying the fuzzy weights. Various techniques exist for each aspect. However, Little research has examined fuzzy AHP in terms of these aspects and set out the relative benefits of the techniques. This paper reviews the techniques regarding these four aspects, aiming to guide both academics and industrial experts to choose suitable techniques according to their practical context.In many professional situations, experts are confronted with a given set of alternatives that they need to choose from, for example when selecting a supplier or a technology.

        <p>AHP structures a problem in a hierarchical way, descending from a goal to criteria, subcriteria and alternatives in successive levels (Saaty, 1990). The hierarchy provides the experts with an overall view of the complex relationships inherent in the context; and helps them to assess whether the elements of the same level are comparable. Elements are then pairwise compared according to 9 level-scales to derive their weights. However, pairwise comparison, the essence of AHP, introduces imprecision because it requires the judgements of experts. In practical cases, experts might not be able to assign exact numerical values to their preferences due to limited information or capability (Chan &amp; Kumar, 2007;Xu &amp; Liao, 2014).AHP structures a problem in a hierarchical way, descending from a goal to criteria, subcriteria and alternatives in successive levels (Saaty, 1990).

        <p>To handle the imprecision in AHP, exact numbers are replaced with fuzzy numbers representing the linguistic expressions in fuzzy AHP. This tolerates the vague judgements by assigning membership degrees to exact numbers to describe to what extent these numbers belong to an expression. However, introducing fuzzy sets to AHP makes the calculation process less straightforward because different fuzzy sets exist and the associated operations are complex. The techniques for AHP such as eigenvector method and geometric mean cannot directly be used to derive the weights/priorities from a fuzzy comparison matrix.To handle the imprecision in AHP, exact numbers are replaced with fuzzy numbers representing the linguistic expressions in fuzzy AHP.

        <p>The earliest reference that we have found dates from 1983 (Van Laarhoven &amp; Pedrycz, 1983). Now, fuzzy AHP has become a popular fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method (Kubler et al., 2016). It is applied in various industries, for example airline retail (Rezaei et al., 2014), agriculture (Hashemian et al., 2014;Liu et al., 2019), automobile (Büyüközkan &amp; Güleryüz, 2016;Zimmer et al., 2017), logistics (Yayla et al., 2015), manufacturing (Kar, 2014;Ayhan &amp; Kilic, 2015), maritime (Celik &amp; Akyuz, 2018), pharmacy (Alinezad et al., 2013) and service (Khorasani, 2018), and to solve various problems, for example location selection (Erbas et al., 2018;Singh et al., 2018), machine selection (Nguyen et al., 2015;Parameshwaran et al., 2015), supplier selection (Akkaya et al., 2015;Shakourloo et al., 2016;Kumar et al., 2017;Awasthi et al., 2018), technique selection (Budak &amp; Ustundag, 2015;Naderzadeh et al., 2017;Balusa &amp; Gorai, 2018), sustainability management (Calabrese et al., 2016;2019), business impacts assessment (Lee et al., 2015), risk analysis (Mangla et al., 2015), intellectual capital assets management (Calabrese et al., 2013) and teaching performance evaluation (Chen et al., 2015). These decision problems all deal with the assessment and prioritisation of the alternatives which could be physical entities (e.g. machines, suppliers and locations) or abstract items (e.g. business impact indicators and risk factors). The results are used for selection if a preferred solution is required. The fuzzy AHP models built for the assessment problem in one field are applicable to other fields. This review paper is based on a systematic search of literature published since 2008 where fuzzy AHP is applied to the decision-making problems in industry.

Its reciprocal, 1/ ij c , is equal to the relative importance of criterion j over i, ji c . For example, the triangular fuzzy number (2,3,4) in the judgement table of expert 1 is the relative importance of criterion 1 over criterion 2 and thus (1/4,1/3,1/2) is that of criterion 2 over criterion 1. Replacing crisp values with fuzzy sets is the fundamental difference between fuzzy AHP and AHP. It results in that the techniques to derive weights/priorities in AHP cannot directly be used.[] nn be the matrix for n criteria against the goal. ij c is a fuzzy set representing the relative importance of criterion i over j.

        <p>Check the consistency: Without this step, weights can still be obtained, and thus it is overlooked by some research. However, it is necessary to measure the fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix for the consistency. Suppose that criterion 1 is more important than criterion 2 and much more important than criterion 3. Logically, criterion 2 is more important than criterion 3. If the expert judges criterion 2 less important than criterion 3, then the judgements between criteria 1, 2 and 3 are in conflict. This step takes place after the comparison matrix is established (either the one from an individual expert or the aggregated one from multiple experts). The matrix is considered consistent if the contradictions among the pairwise comparisons are within a predefined threshold, namely consistency ratio. Otherwise, the experts need to re-compare the criteria.

        <p>The calculations of the sub-criteria weights and the alternative priorities follow the same process as described above. The calculated weights of sub-criteria are 'local weights', which are transformed to 'global weights' by multiplying with the weight of their parent criterion. For ease of explanation, we use 'weight' for 'global weight'. The overall priority of alternative Si is the aggregation of its priorities under all the criteria/sub-criteria. wj is the weight of criterion/sub-criterion j; pj Si is the priority of Si under criterion j; n is the number of criteria/sub-criteria.The calculations of the sub-criteria weights and the alternative priorities follow the same process as described above.

        <p>This research was carried out in two stages as shown in Figure 2. In the first stage, we chose 'supplier selection' as the primary investigation topic. Fuzzy AHP is a generic decisionmaking method, applicable to most problems. Supplier selection is a typical and representative decision-making problem, involving prioritisation, assessment and ranking. It has a mixture of subjective and objective criteria and brings out many situations for which fuzzy AHP is required. As listed in Table A.9, it has been applied in a number of industries. Therefore, supplier selection is a potential target for many of the techniques. It is also a topic where fuzzy AHP has been most commonly used, according to the numbers of the reviewed articles. This corresponds to the survey result of Kubler et al. (2016). We selected 57 articles to analyse the methodological development of fuzzy AHP in terms of the four aspects. Under each aspect, the identified techniques were further categorised according to their properties (cf. fishbone diagram in Figure 2). Each part of the fishbone diagram is presented in details in the following sections (cf.

The topics were selected according to the number of articles using fuzzy AHP in the review paper by Kubler et al.

Compared with supplier selection, fewer articles apply fuzzy AHP to rank the alternatives.

        <p>It is the fundamental step of building a fuzzy AHP model to establish the pairwise comparison matrix with the expert's judgement. Linguistic terms describe the relative importance of a criterion or an alternative over another (e.g. 'equally preferred', 'fairly strongly preferred' and 'absolutely preferred'). In fuzzy AHP, such a term is represented by a fuzzy set which consists of two components, a set of elements x and an associated membership function (Klir &amp; Yuan, 1995). The membership function assigns to each element a value between 0 and 1 as its membership degree to the set. The mappings between the fuzzy set and the linguistic term must conform to a scale so that the same judgement produces the same measurable value. Such a scale is called fuzzy scale. Figure 4 outlines the structure of this section. Different types of fuzzy sets are explained by referring to the application context.It is the fundamental step of building a fuzzy AHP model to establish the pairwise comparison matrix with the expert's judgement.

        <p>The fuzzy set described by a set of elements and crisp values as their membership degrees is called type-1 fuzzy set. A crisp number can be fuzzified. For example, 2 is definitely close to itself, so its membership degree to 'approximate 2' is 1. If 1.5 is considered neither close nor far to 2, 0.5 can be assigned as its membership degree to 'approximate 2'. A series of such numbers with their membership degrees compose a fuzzy set 'approximate 2', denoted as .The fuzzy set described by a set of elements and crisp values as their membership degrees is called type-1 fuzzy set.

        <p>Let 2 describe 'moderate importance' of one criterion over another in AHP. In fuzzy AHP replaces 2. Including a series of numbers addresses the problems that experts in some cases are unable to assign an exact number to the judgement. Their memberships indicate to what extent the experts are sure about the numbers to be used for the judgemnt. Mathematically, a fuzzy number is a convex normalised fuzzy set of the real line such that its associate membership function is piecewise continuous (Zimmermann, 2001). Because complicated fuzzy numbers may cause important difficulties in data processing such as hard to define arithmetic operations, several simple and representative fuzzy numbers have been proposed (Yeh, 2008;Ban &amp; Coroianu, 2012;Yeh, 2017). Triangular fuzzy number (TFN) and trapezoidal fuzzy number (TraFN) are two kinds of such fuzzy numbers that have been well studied.Let 2 describe 'moderate importance' of one criterion over another in AHP.

Triangular fuzzy number (TFN) and trapezoidal fuzzy number (TraFN) are two kinds of such fuzzy numbers that have been well studied.</p>
        <p>TFN is the mostly popular means of judgement representation in the reviewed articles (99 out of the 109 articles, i.e. 91%). A TFN can be expressed as a triple where l and h are the smallest and the largest values with the smallest membership respectively and m is the value with the largest membership. The membership function of a TFN is defined as follows and illustrated in Figure 5 (a).

        <p>The α-cut set of a TFN can be represented as an interval, i.e. TFN is useful when the expert is definitive about a single point representing the total belongingness. For example, if 30℃ is considered as a definitely high temperature, slightly below it is hot but not so hot and above it is also hot but too hot, then TFN describes this judgement (i.e. m = 30℃). But if the expert is certain within an interval, such as any temperature between 28 to 32 ℃ is considered as a definitely high temperature while below 28 ℃ is hot but not so hot and above 32 ℃ is also hot but too hot, then TraFN is needed. It is characterised by a quadruple (l, ml, mh, h) as shown in Figure 6. In the example, ml = 28℃ and mh = 32℃. When ml = mh, a TraFN reduces to a TFN. Sometimes, there is a mixed use of TFN and TraFN, for example, Aydin and Kahraman (2010).The α-cut set of a TFN can be represented as an interval, i.e. TFN is useful when the expert is definitive about a single point representing the total belongingness.

        <p>The membership space of type-1 fuzzy set is assumed to be the space of real numbers. A natural extension is the definition of type-2 fuzzy set whose membership values are type-1 fuzzy sets rather than real numbers (Zimmermann, 2001). Type-2 fuzzy set captures more imprecision because it expresses the imprecision on both the elements and their memberships. It helps when the expert is not sure about the membership of an element to a set.

        <p>Fuzzy programming methods are iterative algorithms that search every possible value and gradually achieve a solution to a prescribed accuracy (Luenberger &amp; Ye, 2008).

Mathematical models have to be established first, and assistant tools like

The choice of the fuzzy sets determines the overall calculation complexity of the model. Among the three types of fuzzy sets, type-1 fuzzy set requires the least effort, followed by intuitionistic fuzzy set and interval type-2 fuzzy set. This is because the operations on fuzzy sets are defined via the elements and their memberships, as compared in Table 7. As indicated in Figure 1, there is no fixed execution sequence of synthesising multiple judgments, checking consistency, calculating weights/priorities and defuzzifying the fuzzy values.

        <p>There are 5, 6, 7 and 9-level scales that have been applied to describe the relative importance between every two criteria/alternatives. There seems no explanation on the choice of the scale in the research that have applied the fuzzy scale. Saaty (2008) discusses that psychologically people are able to distinguish between high, medium and low at one level and for each in a second level below to also distinguish between high, medium and low. This produces nine different categories, where the smallest is (low, low) and the highest is (high, high). This is the principle that AHP has a 9-level scale for the top of pairwise comparisons as compared with the lowest value on the scale. A scale provides a reference for comparison. It is reasonable that other scales exist as long as they cover the spectrum of possibilities and discriminate the alternatives in their application context. Small changes in judgement lead to small changes in the derived weights/priorities (Wilkinson, 1965).There are 5, 6, 7 and 9-level scales that have been applied to describe the relative importance between every two criteria/alternatives.
