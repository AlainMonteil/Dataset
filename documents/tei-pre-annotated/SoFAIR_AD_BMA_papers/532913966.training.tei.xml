        <p>We empirically estimate the effect of the GEJE on the stock prices of firms. Our analyses are based on a global sample of 470 firms collected from articles and announcements in the business press that identify affected firms, as well as 382 firms that are not mentioned in the business press but are in industries potentially subject to contagion or competitive effects.We empirically estimate the effect of the GEJE on the stock prices of firms.

        <p>We estimate that firms experiencing supply chain disruptions due to the GEJE lost on average 5.21% of their shareholder value during the one-month period after the GEJE. For Japanese firms, the effect was much more severe with an average 9.32% loss in shareholder value. Non-Japanese firms averaged a 3.73% loss in shareholder value. We also find that upstream and downstream supply chain propagation effects from the GEJE are negative, and the contagion effect on firms related to the nuclear industry is very negative. For firms in the rebuilding industries or competitors to firms affected by the GEJE, the competitive effect from the GEJE is positive.We estimate that firms experiencing supply chain disruptions due to the GEJE lost on average 5.21% of their shareholder value during the one-month period after the GEJE.

        <p>The loss suffered by both Japanese firms and non-Japanese firms experiencing supply chain disruptions due to the GEJE is economically significant. Although the loss is more severe for firms whose operations were directly affected by the GEJE, it is also significant for firms who experienced indirect effects from their upstream and downstream supply chain partners, further confirming the importance of supply chain risk mitigation strategies.The loss suffered by both Japanese firms and non-Japanese firms experiencing supply chain disruptions due to the GEJE is economically significant.

        <p>The March 11, 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake (hereafter referred to as the GEJE) that hit the Pacific coast of Japan is considered as one of the most severe earthquakes on record. The earthquake, tsunami, aftershocks, and the subsequent meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant brought devastating human, social, and economic damages. It also severely disrupted global supply chains. The business press characterized the GEJE as "the most significant supply chain disruption ever" (Tibken 2011) and a "black swan" catastrophic event for global supply chains. Six Japanese prefectures were primarily impacted, home to over 6,000 factories (Todo et al. 2015). Both domestic and global supply chains in automotive, electronics, and semiconductor industries were especially disrupted (Park et al. 2013).The March 11, 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake (hereafter referred to as the GEJE) that hit the Pacific coast of Japan is considered as one of the most severe earthquakes on record.

        <p>The financial performance is measured by changes in stock prices (or shareholder value). The analyses are based on a primary sample of 470 publicly traded firms collected from articles and announcements in the business press that identify firms affected by the GEJE. The sample is global and consists of firms from 24 different countries, with 48% of the firms headquartered in the US, 19% in Japan, and 13% in Europe. The sample includes firms from both manufacturing and service industries. In addition, we create a sample of 382 firms that are not mentioned in the business press but are in industries potentially subject to contagion effects (negative spillover) and competitive effects (positive spillover) from the GEJE. We use evidence from the financial effects of the GEJE to develop insights and implications into various issues including: the direct effects; upstream and downstream effects of supply chain disruptions; and the contagion and competitive effects in varied industries.The financial performance is measured by changes in stock prices (or shareholder value).

        <p>In the immediate aftermath of the GEJE, there was a great deal of debate about the risks and vulnerabilities of global supply chains. Articles in the business press questioned whether supply chains were more susceptible to disruptions because of popular strategies such as: concentration of plants, suppliers, and inventories in a single region; limited redundancies and lack of slack in supply chains; single sourcing; etc. Some articles also questioned the risks implicit in the popular just-in-time system approach to managing supply chains. For example, The New York Times reported that "Japan's vaunted just in time approach to business has become wait and see" (Jolly 2011). This was perhaps driven by the perception that negative financial impacts from supply chain disruptions due to the GEJE were very severe. However, [4] much of the evidence on the financial impact is anecdotal and qualitative. By estimating the shareholder value effects of GEJE, we provide objective evidence on the financial impact of a significant and catastrophic natural disaster.In the immediate aftermath of the GEJE, there was a great deal of debate about the risks and vulnerabilities of global supply chains.

        <p>A subset of our sample consists of firms whose operations in Japan were not directly affected by the GEJE but instead indirectly affected due to disruptions at either their suppliers or customers. We estimate the financial impact on these firms to provide evidence on the degree to which disruption effects propagate through supply chains. Since firms are dependent on their supply chain partners through exchange of material and information, their financial performance will depend on the performance of their supply chain partners. There is considerable interest in the literature to study the magnitude and persistence of financial performance dependencies in supply chains. Cohen and Frazzini (2008) and Menzly and Ozbas (2010) use firm level and industry level supplier-customer relationships and find that economically significant relationships can help predict each of the related firms' stock returns. Lanier et al. (2010) document accounting-based performance linkages in three-firm supply chains. By estimating the stock price effects of the GEJE across the supply chain, we add to this literature and provide evidence on the financial dependency of supply chain partners from a major supply chain shock.A subset of our sample consists of firms whose operations in Japan were not directly affected by the GEJE but instead indirectly affected due to disruptions at either their suppliers or customers.

        <p>We also provide evidence on the contagion and competitive effects of the GEJE. The idea behind a contagion effect is that negative events affecting a firm or set of firms in an industry can make investors, customers, and suppliers wary of other firms in the same and/or related industries, which can have a negative effect on those firms. In the case of the GEJE, several global industries were impacted including motor vehicle manufacturing, electronics manufacturing, nuclear, and insurance. Although a subset of our sample firms were not affected by the GEJE either directly on their own operations or indirectly via suppliers or customers, they were involved with these industries. We use these samples to study the contagion effects of the GEJE. The alternative to a contagion effect is a competitive effect where negative events such as a natural disaster can create business opportunities for certain firms and industries. A subset of our sample firms were in rebuilding industries or were competitors to firms affected by the GEJE. We use these samples to shed light on the competitive effects of the GEJE.We also provide evidence on the contagion and competitive effects of the GEJE.

        <p>We also compare and contrast our results with Hendricks and Singhal (2003, 2005, 2014) who measure the financial performance impacts from endogenous, firm-specific supply chain disruptions from parts [5] shortages, order changes, production problems, ramp-up issues, etc. They do not study supply chain disruptions that result from natural disasters. In contrast, the GEJE is an exogenous, systemic shock that disrupted global supply chains and affected many firms at the same time.We also compare and contrast our results with Hendricks and Singhal (2003, 2005, 2014) who measure the financial performance impacts from endogenous, firm-specific supply chain disruptions from parts [5] shortages, order changes, production problems, ramp-up issues, etc. They do not study supply chain disruptions that result from natural disasters.

        <p>Much of the literature that examines the impact of natural disasters on firm performance, including shareholder value, focuses on the localized effects experienced by firms or industries that are directly involved in or impacted by the disaster. Examples include the effects of the 1989 San Francisco earthquake on real estate firms (Shelor et al. 1990), and the impact of the 1992 hurricane Andrew on insurance firms (Lamb 1995). There are also a few studies that consider the impact from the GEJE itself. For example, Todo et al. (2015) use both survey and secondary data to study the impact on sales growth and recovery time for firms physically located in the impacted prefectures of Japan (also see Carvalho et al. 2014). More recently, researchers consider indirect effects from natural disasters as well. For example, Barrot and Sauvagnat (2016) study the impacts to sales growth and shareholder value of firms with suppliers headquartered in US counties hit by natural disasters.Much of the literature that examines the impact of natural disasters on firm performance, including shareholder value, focuses on the localized effects experienced by firms or industries that are directly involved in or impacted by the disaster.

        <p>Our paper adds to the extant literature in a number of ways. First, our sample comprises firms headquartered in a number of nations whose shares are traded on a variety of national markets, enabling us to consider impacts to complex and global supply chains. Second, we examine not only firms whose operations in Japan were directly affected; we also consider firms not necessarily located in the areas directly affected by the GEJE but whose upstream or downstream supply chain partners were impacted.Our paper adds to the extant literature in a number of ways.

        <p>Third, we consider negative and positive spillover effects that such major disasters have for firms in certain industries. Last, we estimate the impacts to shareholder value, a more encompassing measure than either revenue-or cost-based performance metrics.Third, we consider negative and positive spillover effects that such major disasters have for firms in certain industries.

        <p>Firms experiencing supply chain disruptions due to the GEJE lost on average 5.21% of their shareholder value during the one-month period after the GEJE. For the Japanese firms in our supply chain disruption subsample, the effect was much more severe with an average 9.32% loss, whereas the non-Japanese firms averaged a 3.73% loss. This percent loss is statistically and economically significant for both the Japanese and non-Japanese firms. For the non-Japanese firms, whose operations are generally not in the region directly affected by the GEJE, the magnitude is less than that for the Japanese subsample.Firms experiencing supply chain disruptions due to the GEJE lost on average 5.21% of their shareholder value during the one-month period after the GEJE.

        <p>We find that upstream and downstream supply chain propagation effects from the GEJE are significantly negative for shareholder value. The average downstream effect from suppliers to customers is -3.06% over the one-month period after the GEJE, and the average upstream effect from customers to suppliers is -4.97% over the same period. The contagion effect of the GEJE on firms related to the nuclear industry is very negative and sustained; the average effect is -12.59% over the one-month period after the GEJE. We find that the motor vehicle manufacturing industry experiences a significant contagion effect but the electronics manufacturing industry does not. Insurance companies with exposure to the GEJE lost 2.09% of their shareholder value over the one-month period after the GEJE. For firms in the rebuilding industries or competitors to firms affected by the GEJE, the competitive effect of the GEJE is positive over the onemonth period after the GEJE.We find that upstream and downstream supply chain propagation effects from the GEJE are significantly negative for shareholder value.

        <p>To get an idea of the industry distribution of our sample, we segment our sample into eight industry groups using the grouping from Hendricks and Singhal (2003) (see Panel B of Table 1). Over 60% of the sample are firms whose primary SIC code is manufacturing (SIC codes 0001-3999) and nearly 40% are firms whose primary SIC code is services (4000-9999). Amongst the manufacturing firms, about 17% of the sample is from rubber, leather, stone, metals, machinery, and equipment; 15% from computers, electronics, communications, and defense; and 12% from food, textile, furniture, paper and chemicals. On the service side, services and financial services account for 90 firms (19% of the sample), half of which are insurance firms. Logistics and supply account for 67 firms (14% of the sample), one-third of which are airlines. The industry distribution suggests that the effect of the GEJE was broad and across most industry sectors. 1 reports sample firm statistics based on the most recent fiscal year completed preceding March 2011. The median observation in the sample represents a firm with $8.52 billion in market value of equity, $12.40 billion in total assets, and $9.34 billion in sales.To get an idea of the industry distribution of our sample, we segment our sample into eight industry groups using the grouping from Hendricks and Singhal (2003) (see Panel B of Table 1).

        <p>To analyze the effects of the GEJE in more detail, we break our sample into various subsamples (see Table 2). We read each article to determine the primary impact of the GEJE on the firm. There are a small number of sample firms that were impacted in multiple ways. In these few cases, we ascertain which source was more prominently highlighted in the press articles.To analyze the effects of the GEJE in more detail, we break our sample into various subsamples (see Table 2).

        <p>Negative impacts from the GEJE include damage and destruction of physical assets, production and service stoppages, supply shortages, decreased demand from business customers or consumers, insurance losses, and negative spillover effects. In considering supply chain disruptions, we take a holistic view of supply chains that includes internal operations as well as those of supply chain partners such as suppliers and customers (e.g., Hendricks and Singhal 2003). Thus, supply chain disruptions in our sample include firms whose operations in Japan were directly affected by the GEJE and also those firms indirectly impacted because of disruptions at their suppliers or customers. Based on the announcements from the business press, the GEJE had a potentially negative effect on 377 firms in our sample (80% of the sample). Negative events such as a natural disaster can also create positive business opportunities for certain firms and industries.Negative impacts from the GEJE include damage and destruction of physical assets, production and service stoppages, supply shortages, decreased demand from business customers or consumers, insurance losses, and negative spillover effects.

        <p>Positive effects include increased demand for reconstruction and rebuilding services and materials, and for alternative products to replace or supplement goods that are in short supply. Based on the announcements from the business press, the GEJE had a potentially positive effect on 93 firms (20% of the sample).

This subsample also includes airlines as many airlines curtailed their operations for a number of reasons including reduced demand for air travel; disruptions in airport operations; and protecting airline crews from radiation and aftershocks.Upstream (113 firms)firms whose operations were not directly affected by the GEJE but instead indirectly affected by upstream propagation from some of their business customers or end consumers affected by the GEJE.

        <p>Since our sample is based on articles appearing in the business press, one can argue that our sample is more representative of larger multinational firms. However, in our research context that considers the [10] impact of the GEJE on global supply chains, larger multinational firms are the ones we are most interested in. As mentioned earlier, compared to other natural disasters, the GEJE has received much more attention from the press, practitioners, and academicians because it disrupted global supply chains and had global impact. Given this, it is not surprising that the English-language business press would have more articles about larger multinational firms based in the US and Europe. However, we note that in 2010, only three of the 100 largest global firms were Japanese headquartered (DeCarlo 2010). Given that our sample has 19% Japanese firms, large Japanese firms appear to be well-represented. Nonetheless, we note that our sample is representative of the impact of the GEJE on large multinational firms, and not necessarily on small and Japan-only firms.Since our sample is based on articles appearing in the business press, one can argue that our sample is more representative of larger multinational firms.

        <p>The GEJE struck the east coast of Japan on March 11, 2011at 2:46 PM local time. Since most of the Asia-Pacific stock markets were open at that time, March 11, 2011 is the first trading day that these markets could react to the GEJE event. Although European, North American and many other stock markets were closed when the GEJE struck Japan, they could react to the GEJE when these markets opened later on March 11, 2011. Thus, March 11, 2011 is the first trading day when markets worldwide could react to the GEJE event. Following event study conventions, we convert calendar time into event time such that the day of the event (March 11, 2011) is Day 0, Day 1 is the trading day following the event, Day -1 is the trading day before the event, etc.The GEJE struck the east coast of Japan on March 11, 2011at 2:46 PM local time.

        <p>It is quite common in event studies to estimate abnormal returns on the day of the event and the day before or after, and attribute this to the event under study (e.g., Hendricks andSinghal 2003, Thirumalai andSinha 2011). The one-or two-day event period is typically preferred because, according to the EMH, information is quickly incorporated into stock prices. However, in our case, information about the severity of the GEJE gradually unfolded over a number of days. For example, in the immediate aftermath of the GEJE, many firms indicated that they were affected by the GEJE, but were uncertain about the nature and severity of the disruptions. Subsequent announcements by these firms provided more details about the nature and severity of the effects. Thus, to capture the abnormal returns associated with the GEJE, we must consider a longer event period.It is quite common in event studies to estimate abnormal returns on the day of the event and the day before or after, and attribute this to the event under study (e.g., Hendricks andSinghal 2003, Thirumalai andSinha 2011).

        <p>The literature does not provide much guidance on the appropriate length of the event period for events such as the GEJE. Jacobs and Singhal (2017) use an 11-day event period to study the stock market reaction to the collapse of the Rana Plaza building in Bangladesh, one of the worst industrial accidents in history. Tielmann and Schiereck (2017) and Ramiah et al. (2017) both examine the stock market reaction to Brexit, using a 15-day event period and an 11-day event, respectively. Carter and Simkins (2004) use a 6-day event period to examine the stock market reaction to airlines from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack in the US. Given the significance of the GEJE, and the ongoing information release about the GEJE, we estimate the abnormal returns on the day of the GEJE as well as the subsequent 20 trading days. Thus, we use a 21-day event period (Day 0 to Day 20) as our main focus, but we also report results for alternate event periods.The literature does not provide much guidance on the appropriate length of the event period for events such as the GEJE.

A number of factors influence our choice of using a 21-day event period.</p>
        <p>First, analysis of the business press indicates that press coverage mentioning our sample firms peaks in the first month after the GEJE, and then declines substantially. For example, the first month after the GEJE accounts for nearly 78% of the articles about our sample firms from our search from March 11, 2011 through September 30, 2011. The second and third months account for 13% and 4% of the articles, respectively.First, analysis of the business press indicates that press coverage mentioning our sample firms peaks in the first month after the GEJE, and then declines substantially.

        <p>Second, we examine the overall stock market volatility before and after the GEJE for the three most represented countries in our sample (US, Japan, and United Kingdom). Increases in stock market volatility could indicate that new information is being released in the market and/or there is uncertainty about the financial implications of an event. Figure 1 plots the daily stock returns from 20 trading days before the GEJE (Day -20) through 60 trading days after the GEJE (Day 60). As seen in Figure 1, there is not much change in the volatility of the US and United Kingdom stock markets before and after the GEJE. Our analyses indicate that post-and pre-GEJE stock market volatilities (measured by the standard deviation of daily stock returns) are not significantly different for the US or United Kingdom stock markets. On the other hand, the volatility in the Japanese market appears to increase for the first several days following the GEJE, and seems to return to the pre-GEJE levels after Day 20. The Japanese stock market volatility during the first 20 trading days after the GEJE (Day 0 to Day 20) is three times higher than the volatility during the 20 trading days before the GEJE (Day -20 to Day -1), statistically significant at the 1% level. Figure 1 and our statistical tests indicate that increases in stock market volatilities are observed generally in the first month (20 trading days) after the GEJE, and only in the Japanese stock market.Second, we examine the overall stock market volatility before and after the GEJE for the three most represented countries in our sample (US, Japan, and United Kingdom).

Figure 1 and our statistical tests indicate that increases in stock market volatilities are observed generally in the first month (20 trading days) after the GEJE, and only in the Japanese stock market.</p>
        <p>Finally, there is some evidence on the recovery of Japanese manufacturing firms from the GEJE. Todo et al. (2015) report the median recovery (defined as restart of production) was five days, and less than 30 days for 90% of the firms that they surveyed. Carvalho et al. (2014) report that although the industrial production in areas directly affected by GEJE fell to 67% in March 2011, it recovered to 91% in June 2011.Finally, there is some evidence on the recovery of Japanese manufacturing firms from the GEJE.

        <p>Given the pattern of press reporting of the GEJE, changes in stock market volatility, evidence on the recovery of Japanese manufacturing firms, and the fact that the stock market is forward looking, a 21-day event period (a month in calendar time) seems reasonable. Thus, our primary focus will be on interpreting the abnormal returns over the 21-day event period. For robustness, we will also report results over both shorter (3-day and 11-day) and longer (61-day) event periods. Note that the 61-day event period spans about three calendar months.Given the pattern of press reporting of the GEJE, changes in stock market volatility, evidence on the recovery of Japanese manufacturing firms, and the fact that the stock market is forward looking, a 21-day event period (a month in calendar time) seems reasonable.

        <p>To calculate the abnormal return on Day t for stock i (see equation 2), we estimate 𝛽 𝛽 ̂𝑖𝑖 𝑅𝑅 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 . Note that 𝛽 𝛽 ̂𝑖𝑖 𝑅𝑅 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 depends on the estimated beta of the stock and the market return on Day t. In the days after the earthquake, the Japanese stock market experienced extreme movements when compared to the movements before the earthquake and other stock markets (see Figure 1). Clearly, the Japanese market returns during the period of interest [Days (0, 20)] do not represent the Japanese market returns in the world where the GEJE did not happen. Thus, using the Japanese market returns from the period of interest underestimates the abnormal return that can be attributed to the GEJE. To correct for this, we assume that the Japanese market returns during the pre-event period represent what would have happened to the Japanese market returns in the world where the GEJE did not happen. To reflect this, we use the distribution of the Japanese returns during the pre-event period to simulate the Japanese market returns in the period of interest. For each of the 61 days in our event period (Day 0 to Day 60), we randomly draw with replacement one return from the 200 daily returns of the Nikkei 225 Index over Days -202 through -3. Each random draw corresponds to a single day return. We then use the market model with alphas and betas estimated from the pre-event period and these randomly drawn market returns to estimate the abnormal returns for each of the 88 Japanese firms in our sample. We repeat this process 1000 times to get 1000 abnormal returns for each event day for each Japanese firm in our sample. We average the abnormal returns from the 1000 trials for each Japanese firm, and use this average as our estimate of daily abnormal returns in reporting the results.To calculate the abnormal return on Day t for stock i (see equation 2), we estimate 𝛽 𝛽 ̂𝑖𝑖 𝑅𝑅 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 .

        <p>As a robustness check, we compare our estimates for the Japanese firms obtained from the market model using simulated Japanese market returns, with the actual returns as well as those obtained from the mean-adjusted model that does not require or use market returns.

        <p>We are estimating the abnormal returns for multiple firms with an event on the same calendar day. This can cause cross-sectional dependence in abnormal returns across the sample firms. If such cross-sectional dependence is not adjusted for, then the standard deviation can be underestimated, and the magnitude of the test statistics can be overestimated. To account for this, we use the test advocated by Brown and Warner 1985) that adjusts for cross-sectional dependence.

        <p>The supply chain disruption results in Table 3 are based on a sample of firms mentioned in the business press such as the Financial Times, the Asian, European, and US editions of the Wall Street Journal, and the Dow Jones News Service. As discussed earlier, one can argue that results based on firms mentioned in the business press may not be representative of the industry. To address this issue as well as to consider the potential contagion effect of the GEJE, we collect an additional sample of firms that are not mentioned in the business press sources that we searched. We focus our analyses on the two largest industry groups in our sample of firms that experienced supply chain disruptions due to the GEJE. These industries are motor vehicle manufacturing (SIC code 371) and electronics manufacturing (SIC code 367). See the online appendix for details of how we collect additional sample firms for these two industries.The supply chain disruption results in Table 3 are based on a sample of firms mentioned in the business press such as the Financial Times, the Asian, European, and US editions of the Wall Street Journal, and the Dow Jones News Service.

        <p>Given that our sample is generated from business press articles, it is possible that some direct effects to firms went unreported, and instead indirect effects from customers or suppliers were reported. If this occurred, the Upstream and Downstream subsamples might over-estimate the magnitude of supply chain propagation effects. If our subsample composition is affected in this manner, the relative difference between the direct effects and indirect effects of the GEJE might be even greater. Hendricks and Singhal (2003, 2005, 2014) Although not a perfect comparison, it is useful to benchmark the results of the supply chain disruptions in our sample with the supply chain disruptions results in Hendricks and Singhal (2003, 2005, 2014), henceforth referred to as H&amp;S. As mentioned earlier, H&amp;S do not study supply chain disruptions that result from natural disasters. Instead, they focus on endogenous, firm-specific disruptions. Given the differences between our sample and H&amp;S, comparisons must be made with caution, but they can provide some perspective on the magnitude of the GEJE impact relative to the impact of supply chain disruptions examined by H&amp;S. Hendricks and Singhal (2003) attribute supply chain disruptions to either internal operations, suppliers, and/or customers, which are analogous to our subsamples of Firm, Downstream, and Upstream, respectively.

        <p>In the case of the GEJE, the contagion (negative) effects for firms involved with the nuclear industry are especially strong and persistent. This is not surprising as the nuclear industry is particularly susceptible to contagion, as observed in the Three Mile Island incident of 1979 (Bowen et al. 1983) and the Chernobyl incident of 1986 (Kalra et al. 1993). Bowen et al. (1983) find that the Three Mile Island incident resulted in a 21-day stock market reaction of -5.39% for US utilities with at least 20% of their capacity from nuclear energy. Kalra et al. (1993) find that the Chernobyl incident resulted in a 21-day stock market reaction of -2.30% for US utilities with at least 20% of their capacity from nuclear energy.In the case of the GEJE, the contagion (negative) effects for firms involved with the nuclear industry are especially strong and persistent.

        <p>We compare our results with other studies on the impact of natural disasters on the insurance industry. Shelor et al. (1992) discuss two opposing hypotheses regarding the impact of natural disasters on insurers: loss claims can deplete insurer resources, leading to loss in shareholder value ("loss as loss"); or, disasters might lead to increased demand for policies as well as premium increases, leading to gain in shareholder value ("loss as gain"). They study the impact of the 1989 California earthquake on US insurers, and find a 2-day CAR of 1.72%, supporting the "loss as gain" hypothesis. Conversely, other researchers (e.g., Angbazo and Narayanan 1996, Lamb 1995, Ewing et al. 2006, Yamori and Kobayashi 2002) find that insurers suffer negative CARs from hurricanes and earthquakes, in the range of -2% to -5%. The average 21-day CAR of -2.09% that we find for insurers affected by the GEJE is in line with these latter findings, and lends support to the "loss as loss" hypothesis.We compare our results with other studies on the impact of natural disasters on the insurance industry.

        <p>The results for the competitive effects indicate that if the focus is on the market reaction over Days (0, 20), then the competitive effect is positive as predicted. However, if one extends the time period to 60 days after the GEJE, the market reaction is not persistent for either the Rebuild or Competitors subsamples. We conjecture that lack of persistence could be due to either quicker-than-anticipated recovery from the disaster, or initial over-exuberance by the stock market in estimating either the potential windfall from reconstruction or stumbles from competitors, or a combination of both.The results for the competitive effects indicate that if the focus is on the market reaction over Days (0, 20), then the competitive effect is positive as predicted.

        <p>Of the 47 firms in the Competitors subsample, 15 are in the renewable energy industries (wind, hydro, and solar). As mentioned earlier, these industries benefited from the backlash against the nuclear industry that emerged subsequent to the meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant. To analyze the competitive effect on renewable energy industries in more depth, we generate a subsample of firms in the renewable energy industries that are not from the business press and compare it with our subsample of firms from the business press.

        <p>This paper provides empirical evidence on the effect of the GEJE on the stock prices (or shareholder value) of firms. The analyses are based on a global sample of 470 publicly traded firms collected from articles and announcements in the business press that identify firms affected by the GEJE. Firms experiencing supply chain disruptions due to the GEJE lost on average 5.21% of their shareholder value during the one-month period after the GEJE. For the Japanese firms, the effect was much more severe with an average 9.32% loss in shareholder value. Non-Japanese firms averaged a 3.73% loss in shareholder value. For both Japanese and non-Japanese firms, this level of loss is statistically and economically significant.This paper provides empirical evidence on the effect of the GEJE on the stock prices (or shareholder value) of firms.

        <p>The contagion effect of the GEJE on firms in the motor vehicle manufacturing industry is significantly negative but not for the electronics manufacturing industry. For the nuclear industry, the contagion effect is very negative and sustained; the average effect is -12.59% over the one-month period after the GEJE for firms mentioned in the business press, and -14.84% for firms not mentioned in the business press. Insurance companies with exposure to the GEJE lose 2.09% of their shareholder value over the one-month period after the GEJE, but insurance firms not mentioned in the business press did not suffer significant losses, indicating no contagion effect.

        <p>A limitation of our analyses is that we study only the GEJE. Although a major disrupter of global supply chains, the GEJE is still only a single event. Generalizing our results to other natural disasters or supply chain shocks must be done with caution. However, given the severity of the event in a highly industrialized region and its global impact on supply chains, it should serve as an upper bound for the effects of natural disasters. Future studies of similar events would aid in generalizability.A limitation of our analyses is that we study only the GEJE.

        <p>Our analyses provide some preliminary explanation of the heterogeneity in abnormal returns across affected firms by comparing and contrasting the results for the various subsamples, as well as those for the Japanese and non-Japanese firms.

Developing and testing appropriate hypotheses regarding the moderating effects of firm level characteristics on abnormal returns could extend our research.Our analyses provide some preliminary explanation of the heterogeneity in abnormal returns across affected firms by comparing and contrasting the results for the various subsamples, as well as those for the Japanese and non-Japanese firms.

        <p>To assess the robustness of our abnormal return estimation method that employs the market model together with simulated market returns for the Japanese sample firms, we compare abnormal returns using two other methods that do not rely on market returns: 1) the mean-adjusted model; and 2) actual returns.To assess the robustness of our abnormal return estimation method that employs the market model together with simulated market returns for the Japanese sample firms, we compare abnormal returns using two other methods that do not rely on market returns: 1) the mean-adjusted model; and 2) actual returns.</p>
        <p>We also assess the robustness of our method to the length of the estimation window by comparing the results obtained using 100-day, 200-day, 250-day, and 300-day estimation periods versus our reported method that employs a 200-day estimation period.We also assess the robustness of our method to the length of the estimation window by comparing the results obtained using 100-day, 200-day, 250-day, and 300-day estimation periods versus our reported method that employs a 200-day estimation period.</p>
        <p>The mean-adjusted model (also known as the comparison period model) makes no assumptions regarding the market returns, and instead assumes that the return of a sample firm without the event is the average return that the sample firm experienced during an estimation period before the event. Thus, abnormal return from the mean-adjusted model is:The mean-adjusted model (also known as the comparison period model) makes no assumptions regarding the market returns, and instead assumes that the return of a sample firm without the event is the average return that the sample firm experienced during an estimation period before the event. Thus, abnormal return from the mean-adjusted model is:</p>
        <p>where 𝑅 𝑅 � 𝑖𝑖 is the average daily return of Firm i from the estimation period. For each sample firm traded in the Japanese market, we estimate 𝑅 𝑅 � 𝑖𝑖 using pre-event returns from Days -202 to Day -3 (a 200-day estimation period).where 𝑅 𝑅 � 𝑖𝑖 is the average daily return of Firm i from the estimation period. For each sample firm traded in the Japanese market, we estimate 𝑅 𝑅 � 𝑖𝑖 using pre-event returns from Days -202 to Day -3 (a 200-day estimation period).</p>
        <p>We note that the mean-adjusted model is commonly used in the literature (e.g., Thirumalai andSinha 2011, Hendricks andSinghal 2003) and is also discussed in methodology papers dealing with event studies (e.g., Brown andWarner 1985, MacKinlay 1997). Although the mean-adjusted model does not require estimation of betas, the results are generally very similar to the models that estimate betas to compute abnormal returns.We note that the mean-adjusted model is commonly used in the literature (e.g., Thirumalai andSinha 2011, Hendricks andSinghal 2003) and is also discussed in methodology papers dealing with event studies (e.g., Brown andWarner 1985, MacKinlay 1997).

        <p>While actual returns do not adjust for betas or other factors, and they are not a CAR in the traditional sense, they help provide some perspective on the reasonableness of the choice of model used to estimate CAR. It is well accepted in the literature that the choice of the model to estimate abnormal returns is less serious in event studies that focus on short windows (ranging from a few days to a few months) since daily expected returns are very small (e.g., Fama 1998).

        <p>Table A.1 reports the comparative results for the 88 Japanese sample firms using the three approaches for Days (0, 20), our main event period of interest. The mean CAR is -8.13% using the market model with simulated Japanese market returns, and it is -8.09% using the mean-adjusted model that does use any market returns. The mean cumulative actual return is -7.59%, which is very similar to both of the estimated CARs. This is what one would expect given that the daily actual return for the 88 Japanese firms based on a 200-day period before the GEJE (Days -202 to Day -3) is about 0.02%, which is quite small. None of the differences in estimation from the three methods are statistically significant. This suggests that our primary estimation method, the market model with simulated Japanese market returns during the event period, is robust.Table A.1 reports the comparative results for the 88 Japanese sample firms using the three approaches for Days (0, 20), our main event period of interest.

This suggests that our primary estimation method, the market model with simulated Japanese market returns during the event period, is robust.</p>
        <p>In our manuscript, we estimate abnormal returns for the Japanese firms using the market model together with simulated market returns. The parameters of the market model and the pool of Japanese market returns used for the simulation are both obtained using a 200-day estimation period (Day ─202 to Day ─3).

        <p>[3] robustness, we also estimate results using four different estimation windows (100-day, 150-day, 250-day, 300-day). We use the same procedure as described in the manuscript. For each estimation window, we run the regressions for each firm to estimate unique market model parameters. Next, for each of the 61 days in our event period (Day 0 to Day 60), we randomly draw with replacement one return from the daily returns of the Nikkei 225 Index over the corresponding estimation window [either Days (─102, ─3), Days (─152, ─3), Days (─252, ─3), or Days (─302, ─3)]. We repeat this process 1000 times to get 1000 abnormal returns for each event day for each Japanese firm in our sample. We average the abnormal returns from the 1000 trials for each Japanese firm, and use this average as our estimate of daily abnormal returns.

        <p>presents the results obtained from using the four different estimation windows, and compares them with the results obtained from using the 200-day estimation window. The results indicate that abnormal returns of the Japanese firms using the simulation method are robust with respect to different estimation periods. As a further check on the robustness of our results to the length of the estimation window, we repeat this analysis for the non-Japanese firms in our sample (N=382). For each firm, we calculate abnormal returns using the market model for four different estimation windows (100-day, 150-day, 250-day, 300day). For each estimation window, we run the regressions for each firm to estimate unique market model parameters. Next, we estimate the abnormal returns for each firm as the difference between the actual returns and the predicted returns from the market model.

Electronics Manufacturing: For the electronics manufacturing industry, our sample from the business press includes 30 firms. For these 30 firms, the dominant SIC codes are 3674 (semiconductors; 14 firms) and 3670 (electronic components; 10 firms). We use the Compustat Global and Compustat North America databases to identify all firms in SIC codes 3670 and 3674 with revenues in 2010. We select the 100 largest firms (by revenue) that are not in our business press sample. We exclude firms that are in the renewable energy industry (photovoltaic components manufacturers) because we suspect a potentially positive competitive effect for these firms. The selected firms have median revenues of $1.5 billion compared to the median revenue of $2.7 billion for our 30 sample firms. 17 of these 100 firms are headquartered in Japan.[4] day estimation window.

We also obtain names of all global nuclear reactor owners and operators from the World Nuclear Association website (http://www.worldnuclear.org/information-library/facts-and-figures/reactor-database.aspx, accessed 11 Jul 2017). This yields an additional 109 firms. Further, we search the Compustat Global and Compustat North America databases [6] to identify any firm in 2010 with the words "nuclear", "atomic", or "uranium" (or foreign variants) in the firm name. This generates another 25 firms. In total, we compile a list of 255 unique firms of which 48 are in the Nuclear subsample obtained from the business press. Of the remaining 207 firms not announced in the business press, 140 are not publicly traded as they are either privately held, state entities, or state owned firms. Of the remaining 67 firms, 44 have sufficient stock price data to estimate abnormal returns during the event period.
