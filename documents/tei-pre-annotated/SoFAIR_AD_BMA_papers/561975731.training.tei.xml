        <p>We find that social capital in U.S. counties, as captured by strength of social norms and density of social networks, is positively associated with innovation of firms headquartered in the county, as captured by patents and citations. This relation is robust in fixed-effect regressions, instrumental variable regressions with a Bartik instrument, propensity score matching regressions, and a difference-in-differences design that isolates the effects of over time variations in social capital due to corporate headquarter relocations. Strength of social norms plays a more dominant role than density of social networks in producing these empirical regularities. Crosssectional evidence indicates the prominence of the contracting channel through which social capital relates to innovation. Additionally, we find that social capital is also positively associated with trademarks and effectiveness of corporate R&amp;D expenditures.We find that social capital in U.S. counties, as captured by strength of social norms and density of social networks, is positively associated with innovation of firms headquartered in the county, as captured by patents and citations.

        <p>Organizations, including government agencies and public corporations, are susceptible to influences arising from social environment in the geographical areas in which they reside. In particular, a vast literature spanning sociology, political sciences, and economics finds that social capital in geographical areas engenders trust, enhances cooperation, and facilitates transactions; and, a nascent stream of this literature finds that social capital surrounding corporate headquarters facilitates corporate contracting, affects corporate decisions, and even mitigates agency conflicts in Chief Executive Officer (CEO) compensation. 1 Building on these insights, we conjecture that social capital surrounding corporate headquarters is positively associated with corporate innovation because social capital facilitates contracting for innovation within the firm and eases a firm's access to external capital.Organizations, including government agencies and public corporations, are susceptible to influences arising from social environment in the geographical areas in which they reside.

        <p>Using a sample of 22,010 firm-year observations for 2,142 unique firms during 1992-2010, we find that firms headquartered in U.S. counties with higher levels of social capital file more new patents in any given year and the patents they filed generate more citations in subsequent years, holding firm attributes and county-level factors constant. The social capital measure we use embodies county-level social influences arising from both social networks and cooperative norms (e.g., Rupasingha, Goetz, and Freshwater, 2006), where cooperative norms are non-religious social norms that emphasize cooperative behaviors (Knack, 2002;Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales, 2010). Based on our estimates, a one-standard-deviation increase in the social capital variable in our data implies a net increase of three new patents filed in a given year.Using a sample of 22,010 firm-year observations for 2,142 unique firms during 1992-2010, we find that firms headquartered in U.S. counties with higher levels of social capital file more new patents in any given year and the patents they filed generate more citations in subsequent years, holding firm attributes and county-level factors constant.

        <p>On average, firms in our sample produce 26 new patents per year.

        <p>The positive linkage between social capital and innovation is robust when we use alternate patent-based measures that are scaled by either R&amp;D expenditures or the total number of employees and when we use alternate citation-based measures that exclude self-citations. It holds when we use a longer-lead window of up to three years to measure both patents and citations and when we use fixed time windows to account for citations. It also holds when we use firm fixed-effect regression and county fixed-effect regression to isolate the influences of unknown, and therefore omitted, firm-level and county-level factors that are stable over time, respectively. It remains robust when we use instrumental variable regressions with a Bartik instrument, when we use a propensity-score matched sample to estimate the regressions, and when we use a difference-in-differences empirical design to isolate the effects of over time changes in social capital resulting from corporate headquarter relocations on innovation. Lastly, we find that social capital is positively associated with alternate innovation outcome measures such as trademarks (Heath and Mace, 2019) and effectiveness of corporate R&amp;D expenditures (Knott, 2008).The positive linkage between social capital and innovation is robust when we use alternate patent-based measures that are scaled by either R&amp;D expenditures or the total number of employees and when we use alternate citation-based measures that exclude self-citations.

        <p>If social capital lessens employees' perception of expropriation risk in innovation or improves employees' perception of executive trustworthiness, the positive social-capital-innovation linkage should be more pronounced among geographically diversified firms and among firms beleaguered by significant concern in employee relations. We find that, relative to firms with narrower geographical reach (firms with no employee concerns), an increase in social capital in geographically diversified firms (firms with one or more employee concerns) has significantly stronger positive effects on innovation.If social capital lessens employees' perception of expropriation risk in innovation or improves employees' perception of executive trustworthiness, the positive social-capital-innovation linkage should be more pronounced among geographically diversified firms and among firms beleaguered by significant concern in employee relations.

        <p>Organization capital, a type of firm-specific intangible asset, could contribute to corporate innovation (e.g., Lev, Radhakrishnan, and Zhang, 2009;Lev and Radhakrishnan, 2005;Bresnahan and Trajtenberg, 1995); but, both shareholders and key talent involved in innovation have a claim on the gains accruing from organization capital (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2013).Organization capital, a type of firm-specific intangible asset, could contribute to corporate innovation (e.g., Lev, Radhakrishnan, and Zhang, 2009;Lev and Radhakrishnan, 2005;Bresnahan and Trajtenberg, 1995); but, both shareholders and key talent involved in innovation have a claim on the gains accruing from organization capital (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2013).</p>
        <p>Accordingly, it could be that corporate innovation is positively associated with organization capital and that social capital strengthens this positive linkage. We provide evidence consistent with these conjectures.

        <p>Staggered deregulation of interstate bank branching laws produce exogenous shocks to banking competition that expand the availability of bank credits to firms (Rice and Strahan, 2010). We provide evidence that deregulation significantly moderates the positive social-capitalinnovation linkage, possibly affording evidence of a financing channel through which social capital indirectly enhances a firm's innovation by easing its access to external capital.Staggered deregulation of interstate bank branching laws produce exogenous shocks to banking competition that expand the availability of bank credits to firms (Rice and Strahan, 2010).

        <p>Broadly speaking, this study provides fresh evidence that adds to an already fruitful line of research that explores the effects of social environment on corporations (e.g., Hilary and Hui, 2009;McGuire, Omer, and Sharp, 2012;Dyreng, Mayew, and Williams, 2012;Benjamin, Choi, and Fisher, 2016). Narrowly speaking, it provides evidence that adds to the strand of research that specifically explores the influences of external environmental factors such as competition, laws, religion, and accounting standards on corporate innovation. 2 Our study is closely related to prior research that specifically explore the social-capitalinnovation linkage at the macro-level using country-level data or region-level data and at firmlevel using survey data. 3 On one hand, we differ from prior macro-level studies (Dakhli and De Clercq, 2004;Akçomak and Ter Weel, 2009) in that we focus on innovation outcomes in publicly listed corporations. On the other hand, we provide large-sample evidence using corporate innovation outcome measures that are based on archival data of patents and citations; in contrast, prior firm-level studies (Landry, Amara, Lamari, 2002;Molina-Morales and Martinez-Fernandeze, 2010) provide small-sample evidence using innovation measures based on surveys.Broadly speaking, this study provides fresh evidence that adds to an already fruitful line of research that explores the effects of social environment on corporations (e.g., Hilary and Hui, 2009;McGuire, Omer, and Sharp, 2012;Dyreng, Mayew, and Williams, 2012;Benjamin, Choi, and Fisher, 2016).

        <p>In particular, our study complements Laursen, Masciarelli, and Prencipe (2012), hereafter LMP, which also provide large-sample evidence based on data from 2,413 manufacturing firms 2 Aghion, Bloom, Blundell, Griffith, and Howitt (2005) examine the effect of market characteristics such as competition. Acharya and Subramanian (2009) and Acharya, Baghai, and Subramanian (2014) examine the effects of state-level legal institutions such as bankruptcy laws and wrongful employee discharge laws. Chen, Podolski, Rhee, and Veeraraghavan (2014) focus on the effect of county-level factor such as religious adherence. He and Tian (2016) examine the effect of a market-wide short-sale regulation change, Regulation SHO, on corporate patenting activities. Zhong (2018) examines the effects of country-level factor such as international accounting standards. 3 Dakhli and De Clercq (2004) provide evidence using country-level data from a sample that consists of 59 countries from all five continents. Likewise, Akçomak and Ter Weel (2009) provide evidence using region-level data from 102 regions across 14 European Union countries. These studies provide macro-level evidence relating either country-level or region-level social capital to country-level or region-level innovation activities. Consistent with these macro-level findings, Thompson (2018) provides an analytical model that links societal social capital to innovation and economic growth at the country level. Aside from these macro-level studies, prior research have also explored the social-capital-innovation linkage using firm-level survey data. Landry, Amara, Lamari (2002) provide evidence using survey data from a sample of 440 manufacturing firms in Montreal, Quebec. Molina-Morales and Martinez-Fernandeze (2010) and Pérez-Luño, Medina, Lavado, and Rodríguez (2011) provide evidence using survey data from 220 industrial firms in Valencia region in Spain and 143 firms in Spain, respectively. These firmlevel studies typically rely on smaller samples because it is difficult to obtain responses from firms. Moreover, they tend to focus on the "relational side of social capital" (Pérez-Luño, Medina, Lavado, and Rodríguez, 2011) that focuses on the influences of social networks and social interactions on innovation. Consequently, prior research are mostly silent on the extent to which social norms relate to corporate innovation, with the exception of Dakhli and De Clercq (2004). These researchers make a distinction between social norms and social networks. Using country-level data, they provide evidence that social networks are positively associated with innovation but social norms do not. In contrast, Florida, Cushing, and Gates (2002) argue and provide some preliminary evidence that strong social interactions per se do not necessarily encourage innovation. Following these research, we provide an exploratory analysis to examine the distinct effects of social norms and social networks on corporate innovation in Section 7. across 21 Italian regions. LMP find that firms located in a region in Italy with a higher level of social capital, as captured by more extensive social networks and more frequent social interactions, are associated with a higher propensity to introduce a product innovation, where innovation propensity is measured using survey response that indicates whether the firm introduced a product innovation during the three-year period that immediately preceded the survey, or not.In particular, our study complements Laursen, Masciarelli, and Prencipe (2012), hereafter LMP, which also provide large-sample evidence based on data from 2,413 manufacturing firms 2 Aghion, Bloom, Blundell, Griffith, and Howitt (2005) examine the effect of market characteristics such as competition.

        <p>We extend the LMP's findings in three ways. We use patent-based and citation-based measures to capture innovation outputs and performance. We provide evidence on contracting and financing channels through which the positive social-capital-innovation linkage arises. LMP do not. Additionally, LMP focus on the association between social networks/social interactions and a firm's propensity to innovate. In contrast, we explore the distinct effects of cooperative norms and social networks on corporate innovation. We find that strength of cooperative norms plays a more dominant role than density of social networks in our data.We extend the LMP's findings in three ways.

        <p>Innovation promotes economic growth (Schumpeter, 1942;Solow, 1957;Guiso, Sapienza and Zingales, 2004). Adding to this literature, we show that social capital engenders economic benefit for the society through corporate innovation. If shareholders benefit from corporate innovation outputs (Kogan, Papanikolaou, Seru, and Stoffman, 2017), the positive social-capitalinnovation linkage implies that social capital surrounding corporate headquarters fosters an external, social environment that is beneficial to shareholders of publicly listed firms. This particular insight adds to recent advents documenting the effects of social capital surrounding corporate headquarters on corporations. Besides mitigating agency problems (Hoi, Wu, and Zhang, 2019), reducing costs of debt (Hasan, Hoi, Wu, and Zhang, 2017b), reducing costs of equity (Gupta, Raman, and Shang, 2018), and improving financial reporting quality (Jha, 2019), social capital apparently also benefits shareholders by cultivating an external environment that fosters corporate innovation.Innovation promotes economic growth (Schumpeter, 1942;Solow, 1957;Guiso, Sapienza and Zingales, 2004).

        <p>Social capital can facilitate contracting for innovation within firms. Alternatively, social capital can ease a firm's access to external capital, which, in turn, facilitates financing for innovation.

This section presents these arguments, both predicting a positive association between social capital and corporate innovation.</p>
        <p>Contracting for innovation is difficult because it requires an assessment of risk-return tradeoffs conditional on incomplete information (Aghion and Tirole, 1994). In the corporate setting, the difficulty is exacerbated for at least two reasons. First, innovation activities are undertaken by employees who are often assigned multiple tasks and led by corporate executives who are themselves delegates of shareholders (Holmstrom, 1989;Holmstrom and Milgrom, 1991;Hellmann and Thiele, 2011). Second, corporate executives and employees usually do not maintain frequent and repeated interactions because they are seldom engaged in joint production.Contracting for innovation is difficult because it requires an assessment of risk-return tradeoffs conditional on incomplete information (Aghion and Tirole, 1994).

        <p>Despite that, formal contracts with a long-term focus can facilitate corporate innovation (Xue, 2007;Manso, 2011). Additionally, state laws preventing arbitrary termination of employee labor contracts and wrongful discharge laws can spur corporate innovation by mitigating hold-up problems in innovation on the part of employers that arise from expropriation of ex-post surplus on the upside when innovation activities undertaken by employees produce successful outcomes in the firm (Acharya, Baghai, and Subramanian, 2013;Acharya, Baghai, and Subramanian, 2014). North (1994) emphasizes that institutions "are made up of formal constraints (e.g., rules, laws, constitutions), informal constraints (e.g., norms of behavior, self-imposed codes of conduct), and their enforcement characteristics" (p. 360); and, these institutions could alter the benefit/cost ratios in favor of cooperation. Accordingly, we conjecture that informal, non-legal social institution, such as social capital, could facilitate contracting for collective innovation processes within firms, possibly by reducing employees' perception of expropriation risk in innovation or improving employees' perception of executive trustworthiness (Nooteboom, 2013).Despite that, formal contracts with a long-term focus can facilitate corporate innovation (Xue, 2007;Manso, 2011).

        <p>Evidence suggests that social capital surrounding corporate headquarters limits firm and managerial opportunistic behaviors (Hasan, Hoi, Wu, andZhang 2017a and2017b;Hoi, Wu, and Zhang, 2019). Accordingly, one would expect that corporate executives residing in high-socialcapital communities are also less likely to engage in expropriation of ex-post surplus in innovation, possibly because they view such opportunistic behaviors as contradictory to the prescribed values associated with the attendant norms in communities and anticipate greater psychic costs and higher social sanctions for perpetrating such opportunistic behaviors.Evidence suggests that social capital surrounding corporate headquarters limits firm and managerial opportunistic behaviors (Hasan, Hoi, Wu, andZhang 2017a and2017b;Hoi, Wu, and Zhang, 2019).

        <p>Moreover, public corporations are large organizations where activities, including innovation, are coordinated through processes of centralized resource allocation implemented by corporate executives. These internal capital markets are effective in resource allocation in firms where little or no information asymmetry exists between divisions and corporate headquarters (Williamson 1975;Stein 1997). However, in the case of innovation such an assumption is likely violated. Managers and other employees with research responsibilities often have substantial information advantage when compared to corporate executives (Scherer, 1984), and these individuals and corporate executives only interact infrequently because they are only rarely involved in joint production. As such, non-executive employees involved in innovation could exploit their informational advantages to tilt resource allocation in their favor (Seru, 2014), reducing the efficacy of formal contracts. Moreover, once the R&amp;D investment has been made and the innovation process starts, these individuals may have incentives to expropriate rents by demanding higher wage concessions, which creates ex-post holdup problem on the part of employees that could lead to an underinvestment in innovation activities (Malcomson, 1997;Bradley, Kim, and Tian, 2017). In this regard, social capital can also help by building trust between parties involved in the collective innovation processes.Moreover, public corporations are large organizations where activities, including innovation, are coordinated through processes of centralized resource allocation implemented by corporate executives.

        <p>It is well known that trust among contracting parties could encourage cooperation. In particular, evidence suggests that social capital engenders trust and cooperation among strangers and among people who encounter each other infrequently (Coleman, 1988;Putnam, 1993), which, in turn, facilitates contracting among these individuals (Guiso, Sapienza, andZingales, 2004. 2008). Taking this logic a step further, Fukuyama (1995) argues that social capital could facilitate contracting in all organizations. Knack and Keefer (1997) and La Porta, Lopez-De-Silane, Shleifer, and Vishny (1997) provide evidence to confirm this conjecture. Recent advents show that social capital produces such contracting benefits in public corporations, possibly by building a more trusting corporate environment. 4 Accordingly, it stands to reason that employees, including those involved in innovation, could perceive corporate executives as more trustworthy if the firm's headquarter is located in an area with a higher level of social capital.It is well known that trust among contracting parties could encourage cooperation.

        <p>These foregoing studies imply that social capital surrounding corporate headquarter could lessen employees' perception of expropriation risk in innovation and foster trust between employees and executives, which, in turn, allay hold-up problems in collective innovation processes. Consequently, social capital could facilitate the contracting for innovation between executives and employees within the firm, leading to a positive relation between social capital and corporate innovation.These foregoing studies imply that social capital surrounding corporate headquarter could lessen employees' perception of expropriation risk in innovation and foster trust between employees and executives, which, in turn, allay hold-up problems in collective innovation processes.

        <p>The importance of financing for innovation has been discussed extensively in the literature (e.g., Arrow, 1962;Hall, 2002;Hall and Lerner, 2010;Ayyagari, Demirguc-Kunt, and Maksimovic, 2011;Kerr and Nanda, 2015). Recent advents in the literature provide growing evidence that firms use both equity and debt to finance innovation. 5 In particular, Mann (2018) finds that debt financing is common for innovating firms and patents are often used as collateral in securing such debt financing.The importance of financing for innovation has been discussed extensively in the literature (e.g., Arrow, 1962;Hall, 2002;Hall and Lerner, 2010;Ayyagari, Demirguc-Kunt, and Maksimovic, 2011;Kerr and Nanda, 2015).

        <p>In this context, social capital can play an indirect role by facilitating external financing between firms and debt or equity investors. Hasan, Hoi, Wu, and Zhang (2017b) find that banks perceive social capital as providing environmental pressure that constrains firm opportunistic behavior in debt contracting. Gupta, Raman, and Shang (2018) find that equity investors perceive social capital as serving as a "societal monitoring mechanism" that reduces the hazards facing shareholders. Accordingly, it is reasonable to posit that social capital eases a firm's access to external capital, including both equity and debt, which, in turn, spurs innovation and, ultimately, creates a positive association between social capital and corporate innovation.In this context, social capital can play an indirect role by facilitating external financing between firms and debt or equity investors.

        <p>The preceding arguments suggest that social capital cultivates an external, social environment that mitigates hold-up problems in innovation, fosters trust between employees and executives, and facilitates a firm's access to external capital. A strong implication of these arguments is that social capital is positively associated with corporate innovation outputs. We state the associated refutable hypothesis as follows.The preceding arguments suggest that social capital cultivates an external, social environment that mitigates hold-up problems in innovation, fosters trust between employees and executives, and facilitates a firm's access to external capital.

        <p>We measure density of social networks using NRCRD data on social organizations (Assn) and non-profit organizations (Nccs).

        <p>Nccs is the total number of tax-exempt non-profit organizations with a domestic focus in the county divided by populations per 10,000. 6 Following Rupasingha, Goetz, and Freshwater (2006), we use a principal-component analysis (PCA) to construct our own measure of county-level social capital in the US for each year in 1990, 1997, 2005, and 2009 in which NRCRD data exist. Social capital is the first principal component from a PCA based on Pvote, Respn, Nccs, and Assn in the year. We fill in the data for the missing years using the social capital measure in the preceding year in which data are available. This is consistent with the procedure adopted by Hilary and Hui (2009), which examines the effects of local religiosity on corporate decisions. For example, we fill in the missing data from 1998 to 2004 using Social capital in 1997 and the missing data from 2006 to 2008 using Social capital in 2005.

        <p>Figure 1 presents spatial distributions of Social capital in 2005. We sort this variable into quintiles and use its quintile ranks (Low = 1 to High = 5) to create the snapshot, in which a darker shade represents a higher rank of the variable. Figure 1 shows that social capital is higher in upper Midwest/Northwest counties and lower in Southeast/Southwest counties. The pattern is similar to those reported by Rupasingha, Goetz, and Freshwater (2006), which uses the 1997 data from NRCRD. 6 We adjust the Nccs and Assn data in 1990 and 1997 for the following reasons. First, we use only the 10 types of social organizations that are consistently reported in NRCRD to account for social organizations. This affects the Assn data in both 1990 and 1997. Second, we find that NRCRD underreports the number of non-profit organizations in 1990, and, consequently, we use a time trend method to adjust the Assn data in 1990. The NRCRD reports the variables and data in two different datasets. The old dataset, OLD_NRCRD, reports data for 1990, 1997, and 2005. The new dataset, NEW_NRCRD, reports data for 1997, 2005, and 2009. There are discrepancies in the Nccs and Assn variables between OLD_NRCRD and NEW_NRCRD. We make adjustments to these two variables for years 1990 and 1997. In the end, our social capital measures in 1990 and 1997 are highly correlated with the corresponding social capital indexes reported in NRCRD. The corresponding Pearson correlation coefficients are statistically significant at the 1% level and they are 0.93 and 0.99, respectively. Our main findings are qualitatively unchanged when we use the original NRCRD social capital indexes as an alternate measure of social capital.Figure 1 presents spatial distributions of Social capital in 2005.

        <p>Following Hirshleifer, Low, and Teoh (2012), Faleye, Kovacs, andVenkateswaran (2014), andBernstein (2015), we use the total number of patents a firm filed in a given year and the total number of citations the firm ultimately received from the patents it filed during the given year to capture corporate innovation performance. The filing year is used because there is a time lag between the filing year and the year in which a patent is granted. There is evidence that these patent-based metrics reflect the timing, the quantity, and the quality of corporate innovation (Trajtenberg, 1990). Firm-level patent and citation data are from the database complied by Kogan, Papanikolaou, Seru, and Stoffman (2017), hereafter KPSS. 7 Based on these data, we compute the total number of new patents firm i filed in year t (Patenti,t) and the total number of citations firm i ultimately received from the new patents it filed in year t (Citationi,t).Following Hirshleifer, Low, and Teoh (2012), Faleye, Kovacs, andVenkateswaran (2014), andBernstein (2015), we use the total number of patents a firm filed in a given year and the total number of citations the firm ultimately received from the patents it filed during the given year to capture corporate innovation performance.

        <p>A firm with more growth opportunities naturally is more innovative. We expect that growth prospect (Market-to-bookt-1) is positively correlated with innovation. Balsmeier, Fleming, and Manso (2017) argue that leverage accounts for financial constraints, which, in turn, dampen corporate innovation. Therefore, we expect a negative relation between leverage (Leveraget-1) and innovation. In contrast, large firms might have greater capabilities to innovate (Acs and Audresch, 1987). We use natural logarithm of net sales to capture the influences of firm size. A firm with more tangible assets invests less in intangible assets, thus we expect a negative relation between asset structure (Tangibilityt-1) and innovation. Firms with better accounting performance should have greater latitude to engage in innovation activities. Thus we expect a positive relation between profitability (ROAt-1) and innovation. Fang, Tian, and Tice (2014) show a positive relation between capital expenditure and innovation, so we also control for capital expenditure (Capital expendituret-1) in our model.

        <p>Cross-county differences in economic development, infrastructure quality, and labor market quality could drive differences in corporate innovation across counties; such differences are likely to correlate with county-level demographical factors such as income level, population size, population growth, educational level, and age profile (Alesina and La Ferrara, 2000;Putnam, 2001;Rupasingha, Goetz, and Freshwater, 2006).8 Accordingly, we include all of the aforementioned county-level factors in the empirical models to isolate the association between social capital and corporate innovation. Geographical agglomeration could affect corporate innovation by facilitating information sharing and creating knowledge spillover among firms colocated in the same location or in nearby locations (Marshall, 1920;Jaffe, Trajtenberg, and Henderson, 1993;Carlino, Chatterjee, and Hunt, 2007). Accordingly, we include county-level variables to control the influences of population density on information sharing in the county and we include two dummy variables to capture whether a firm is headquartered in an urban setting or whether the firm is headquartered in a location known for innovation (i.e., hot spot). Lastly, we include industry fixed effects (based on 2-digit SIC codes), state fixed effects, and year fixed effects in the models to isolate the influences of unknown omitted factors across industries, across states, and across years (Audretsch and Feldman, 1996).

        <p>Table 2, Panel A, presents the results from two baseline regression models, where the dependent variables are Log(1+Patent) and Log(1+Citation), respectively. In both models, the coefficients on Social capital are positive and significant at the 1% level. These results are economically meaningful. Based on the estimates in the model with Log(1+Patent), a one-standard-deviation increase in Social capital in the data is associated with an increase of almost three new patents filed in a given year, implying an increase in patent production of roughly 12 percent based on the mean number of 26 new patents filed in a given year per firm in our data.9 Likewise, the same increase in Social capital is associated with an increase of about 41 citations in a given year, which amounts to an increase in citation performance of about 17 percent based on the mean number of citation per firm in our data. These results are in the range of those observed in prior studies. Atanassov (2013) finds that the enactment of business combination state law reduces citation performance by about 21 percent.Table 2, Panel A, presents the results from two baseline regression models, where the dependent variables are Log(1+Patent) and Log(1+Citation), respectively.

        <p>One may argue that time-varying industry specific factors could drive our findings, such as technological opportunities or R&amp;D sentiments. To mitigate this concern, we control for industry-year fixed effect, which is the interactions between industry dummies and year dummies (e.g., Heider and Ljungqvist, 2015). The results are reported in Panel C of Table 3. Our findings hold after controlling for industry-year fixed effect.One may argue that time-varying industry specific factors could drive our findings, such as technological opportunities or R&amp;D sentiments.

        <p>Estimates from the county fixed effect regression provide some confidence that our findings are not significantly affected by omitted, time-invariant county factors that jointly influence innovation and social capital. To bolster confidence on this issue, we perform an instrumental variable regression using a Bartik instrument (Bartik, 1991) that is based on weighted average of national immigration inflow rates from each source country, with weights that depend on the historical shares of the country's immigrants in each county as of 1990.

𝑁𝑁 𝑘𝑘,𝑡𝑡 0 is the total number of immigrants in the U.S. from source country k in 1990. The ratio of these two numbers captures the historical share of county j's immigrants from source country k in 1990.

        <p>Our results are robust to firm or county or industry-year fixed-effect regressions that control for influences of firm-specific/county-specific omitted variables that are time-invariant or time-varying industry-specific omitted factors. However, innovation and social capital could be affected by an unobserved (and hence omitted) variable that is not firm-specific, not countyspecific, and not industry-specific. Additionally, if corporate headquarter location decision is endogenous, so is social capital. These endogeneity issues could result in spurious association between innovation and social capital. In this section, we use the propensity score-matching technique to mitigate these endogeneity concerns. Caliendo and Kopeinig (2008) provide a useful survey of this method. Specifically, from 1992 to 2010, we rank Social capital annually based on the data in that year; and, we classify those firm-years in the top quartile as treatment and those in the bottom quartile as control. For each treatment firm-year, the dummy variable, High social capital, equals one; for each control firm-year, High social capital equals zero. This procedure generates 5,436 firm-years for treatments (High social capital = 1) and 5,389 firm-years for controls (High social capital = 0) during the sampling period 1992-2010. To generate the propensity score, we run a Probit regression model using High social capital as the dependent variable. The independent variables include all variables as specified in the baseline model except the state and year dummies. We then match, without replacement, each treatment in a given year (High social capital = 1) with a unique control in that same year (High social capital = 0) using the closest propensity score. We use a caliper of 1 percent to find the closest match, where caliper refers to the difference in the predicted propensity scores between the treatment and match. Based on these procedures, we identify 846 matched pairs of treatment-control firms.Our results are robust to firm or county or industry-year fixed-effect regressions that control for influences of firm-specific/county-specific omitted variables that are time-invariant or time-varying industry-specific omitted factors.

        <p>Patent-based measures are by no means perfect. Firms with heavy investments in R&amp;D would naturally produce more patents. However, this does not mean that the firm's innovation process is efficient. To get at this issue, we define innovation efficiency (Patent/R&amp;D) as the total number of new patents a firm filed in a given year scaled by the total R&amp;D investment in that year (Hirshleifer, Low, and Teoh, 2012;Hirshleifer, Hsu, and Li, 2013;Shen and Zhang, 2018). As well, following Acharya, Baghai, and Subramanian (2014), we use Patent/total employees as an additional measure of innovation efficiency, which is defined as the total number of new patents a firm filed in a given year scaled by the total number of employees in that year. This measure could also capture the degree of employee effort in innovation process (Acharya, Baghai, and Subramanian, 2014).Patent-based measures are by no means perfect.

        <p>To address the time truncation issue of citations, we follow Hirshleifer, Low, and Teoh (2012) and scale the total number of citations from each patent by the average citation count of all patents in the same technology class in the same year. The variable T_citation is the total sum of the scaled citation count across all new patents a firm filed in year t. To adjust for potential issue arising from self-citations, we gauge the quality of corporate innovation using an alternate measure that excludes all self-citations.

        <p>[Insert Table 6 here] We use a one-year lag to estimate the relation between innovation outputs and social capital. This raises two potential concerns. First, innovation activities have long gestational period. Even if social capital encourages innovation, its influences could take time to materialize, particularly when one uses outcome-based innovation measures such as patents and citations. To mitigate this concern, we measure patents and citations using a three-year leading window. The alternate variables, namely, Log(1+Patent+3) and Log(1+Citation+3), are the total number new patents a firm filed in year t+3 and the total number of citations a firm received from these patents, where t indicates the year in which Social capital is measured. Second, patents obtained in earlier years have a longer time period to generate citations. We address this concern using a three-year (five-year) window to count the total citations that a firm received for the new patents it filed in a given year. The variable, Citation_3 (Citation_5) is the total number of citations a firm received in year t+1 to year t+3 (year t+1 to year t+5) for all the patents a firm filed in year t. Because there is a time lag between the filing year and the year in which a patent is granted, these measures are likely to provide conservative estimates of citation performance.

        <p>Recall that we have actual social capital data from NRCRD in the years of 1990, 1997, 2005, and 2009 during the sample period; and we back fill the missing years with social capital data in the most recent year in which data are available. This back-filling procedure could inflate the statistical significance of the estimates in the regressions. To mitigate this concern, we run the regressions using a reduced sample limited to the four years in which NRCRD social capital data are actually available. Given that our empirical model requires a one-year lag between social capital and innovation, we run the regressions using innovation observed in 1992, 1998, 2006, and 2010 and social capital measured in 1990, 1997, 2005, and 2009. As before, we continue to use either Log(1+ Patent) or Log(1+Citation) as the dependent variable. Table 6, Panel C, reports the results.

        <p>If social capital lessens employees' perception of expropriation risk in innovation or fosters trust between employees and executives by allaying hold-up problems in collective innovation processes, social capital should promote innovation by reducing the difficulties in innovation contracting between employees and executives. Accordingly, the positive socialcapital-innovation linkage should be more pronounced among geographically diversified firms, namely, firms that maintain a significant and material presence in multiple non-headquarter localities. This is so because geographically diversified firms are more likely to undertake innovation activities in non-headquarter locations, creating greater geographical distance between executives and innovating employees. As the number of non-headquarter locations increases, so do information collection costs and transaction costs associated with frequent interactions and intensive involvement that are required to maintain information flow.If social capital lessens employees' perception of expropriation risk in innovation or fosters trust between employees and executives by allaying hold-up problems in collective innovation processes, social capital should promote innovation by reducing the difficulties in innovation contracting between employees and executives.

        <p>Consequently, executives and innovating employees in geographically diversified firms face greater contracting problems for innovation, which, in turn, amplifies the benefit of social capital on contracting.Consequently, executives and innovating employees in geographically diversified firms face greater contracting problems for innovation, which, in turn, amplifies the benefit of social capital on contracting.</p>
        <p>We examine this conjecture using material subsidiary disclosures in Exhibit 21 in 10-K filings as required by the SEC. These disclosures contain the total number of states in which a firm has at least one material subsidiary. The requisite data are provided by Dyreng Scott via his personal website at https://sites.google.com/site/scottdyreng/Home/data-and-code. We define a geographically diversified firm as a firm that reports material subsidiaries in at least three different states in a given year, where the cutoff represents the median value in the sample. The dummy variable, Geographically diversified firms, equals one if a firm has material subsidiaries in at least three different states in a given year, and it equals zero otherwise. We modify the baseline model by adding two variables to the specification, namely, Geographically diversified firms and an interaction term, Geographically diversified firms × Social capital. Table 8, Panel A, reports the results.12 [Insert Table 8 here] Across the models, the coefficients on Social capital remain positive and significant at the 10% level, indicating a positive social-capital-innovation linkage among firms with narrower geographical reach. Consistent with Gao and Chou (2015), the coefficients on Geographically diversified firms are negative and significant, possibly indicating that geographically diversified firms face greater challenges when contracting for innovation. More importantly, the coefficients on the interaction term, Geographically diversified firms × Social capital, are positive and significant at the 5% level, providing evidence that the positive social-capital-innovation linkage is more pronounced among firms with greater geographical diversification. If executives and innovating employees in geographically diversified firms face greater contracting problems for innovation, this finding suggests that social capital alleviates such contracting difficulties in these firms.We examine this conjecture using material subsidiary disclosures in Exhibit 21 in 10-K filings as required by the SEC.

        <p>Significant concerns in employee relations in a firm could adversely affect trust in firm and trust in executives among employees of the firm. Therefore, it stands to reason that the presence of significant concerns in employee relations could heighten employees' anticipation of potential holdup problems and create contracting difficulties in a firm. In this section, we focus on how the social-capital-innovation linkage varies with the presence or the absence of a significant concern in employee relations based the evaluation of a well-recognized third party. Specifically, we define a significant concern in employee relations as a reported weakness in any of the five categories in employee relations as reported in the KLD Research &amp; Analytics database, hereafter KLD. These categories include significant concerns in union relation, health and safety, workforce reduction, retirement benefit, and supply chain controversies. If the presence of a significant concern in employee relations exacerbates contracting problems for innovation, the positive social-capital-innovation linkage should be more pronounced among firms plagued by such matter.Significant concerns in employee relations in a firm could adversely affect trust in firm and trust in executives among employees of the firm.

        <p>We obtain the sample for this analysis by merging our data with data on the aforementioned five categories of concerns in employee relations in KLD. In the end, we obtain a reduced sample of 12,860 firm-years with 1,508 unique firms for the analysis. Data attrition is due to coverage in KLD. We find that about 40% of sample firms report at least one significant concern in employee relations in a given year, providing a natural cutoff for our analysis. We use the dummy variable, Employee concern, to denote a firm that is beleaguered by one or more significant employee concern in a given year.

        <p>Intangible assets are important to organizations, including corporations. Recent research find that organization capital, a type of firm-specific intangible asset, contributes positively to firm performance, market valuation, executive compensation, and expected stock returns (e.g., Lev, Radhakrishnan, and Zhang, 2009;Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2013). Additionally, information technology is a major constituent of organization capital (Lev and Radhakrishnan, 2005) and it offers innovation complementarities that enhance productivity in research and development efforts (Bresnahan and Trajtenberg, 1995). Collectively, these findings imply that organization capital is positively associated with corporate innovation.Intangible assets are important to organizations, including corporations.

Contracting for innovation is difficult because it is conditional on incomplete contract between the firm and its key talent (Aghion and Tirole, 1994). In this regard, social capital can help by fostering trust between contracting parties, namely, executives and key talent involved in the collective innovation processes. If social capital facilitates contracting for innovation within firm, social capital should amplify the positive linkage between organization capital and corporate innovation.However, "the distinguishing features of organization capital are that its efficiency is partly firm specific and that it is embodied in the firm's key talent" and "both shareholders and key talent have a claim on the cash flows accruing from organization capital (Eisfeldt andPapanikolaou, 2013: 1365)."

        <p>Following Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou (2013) and Lev and Radhakrishnan (2005), we measure organization capital by cumulating inflation-adjusted selling and general administrative (SGA) expenditures using the perpetual inventory method. In particular, we use the variable, Organization capitalit, to denote the level of firm i's organization capital in a given year. Specifically, Organization capitalit = (1 -0.15) × Organization capitalit-1 + SGAit ÷ CPIit, where CPI denotes consumer price index, 0.15 is the constant depreciation rate for organization capital, and the initial level of organization capital is calculated as SGAi1 ÷ 0.25 (where 0.25 is the sum of the constant depreciation rate of 0.15 and the assumed growth rate of 0.10). Hereafter, we drop the subscripts for ease of exposition. We modify the baseline model by adding two variables to the specification, namely, Organization capital and an interaction term, Organization capital × Social capital.

        <p>The IBBEA deregulation represents a watershed event that increases banking competition and expands bank credit availability (Rice and Strahan, 2010). However, its effectiveness varies from state to state because states can erect state branching laws to limit the effect of IBBEA deregulation. Cornaggia, Mao, Tian, and Wolfe (2015) find that more effective banking competition, as captured by fewer state branching laws limiting IBBEA's effect, is associated with reduced state-level innovation by publicly listed firms headquartered within deregulating states. However, the negative effect is muted among firms that are more dependent on external financing. This is so because these firms benefit from the improved access to bank credits after deregulation, which, in turn, offsets the reduction in private innovating firms available for acquisition after deregulation.The IBBEA deregulation represents a watershed event that increases banking competition and expands bank credit availability (Rice and Strahan, 2010).

        <p>We argue that social capital is positively associated with corporate innovation, in part, because social capital facilitates a firm's access to external capital. Based on the findings of Cornaggia, Mao, Tian, and Wolfe (2015), one would anticipate that more effective banking competition reduces the positive social-capital-innovation linkage, particularly among firms that are more dependent on externally financing. This is so because these firms benefit 13 SGA could include R&amp;D expenditure, which, in turn, causes a positive association between Organization capital and our innovation measures. To mitigate this concern, we regress Organization capital on R&amp;D and use the regression's residuals to replace Organization capital in the analysis. R&amp;D is the ratio of R&amp;D expenses scaled by total assets. We find the same results in this alternate analysis.

Rice and Strahan (2010) provide data on staggered enactments of state laws limiting the effect of IBBEA after 1994. In particular, they provide the specific years in which these laws were enacted and the total number of these laws each state enacted. Using these data, we construct the dummy variable, Deregulation, to capture firm-years in which IBBEA became effective in each state after 1994. We consider IBBEA as effective when a state enacted no law to restrict entry of large, national banks and distort their means of entry, corresponding those states with RSINDEX equals to zero in Rice and Strahan (2010). Deregulation equals one for firm-years after the year in which a state enacted no law to limit the effect of IBBEA; it equal zero otherwise.disproportionately from the improved access to bank credits after deregulation, plausibly crowding out the financing effect of social capital.

        <p>Thus far, we have argued and provided evidence that strong cooperative norms and dense social networks surrounding corporate headquarters jointly cultivate an external environment that contributes positively to innovation of local companies headquartered in the areas. In this section, following Florida, Cushing, and Gates (2002) and Dakhli and De Clercq (2004), we explore the possibility that cooperative norms and social networks have separate and distinct effects on corporate innovation. 14 We perform F-tests to examine the joint significance of the estimates on Social capital (β1) and the interaction term, Social capital × Deregulation (β2), across the models. We cannot reject the null hypothesis that β1 + β2 = 0 in any of the models. This implies that the positive social-capital-innovation linkage could be overpowered by effective banking competition in states that enacted no branching law to limit the effect of IBBEA. Staggered enactment of state branching laws occurred between 1994 and 2005. Using data based on observations in the year of 2010, Table 6, Panel D, shows that the positive estimate on social capital is statistically significant. This suggests that social capital remains relevant in the post-deregulation era, on average. Additionally, we find that the positive estimate on social capital remains significant when we include the RSINDEX of Rice and Strahan (2010) as an additional control variable to isolate the effect of state branching laws on innovation in the model. This suggests that the strength of banking competition within states does not completely crowd out the effect of social capital on innovation in the post-deregulation era.

        <p>Our main test variable, Social capital, is the first principal component from a factor analysis based on Pvote, Respn, Assn, and Nccs. Following Hasan, Hoi, Wu, and Zhang (2017a), we use the first principal component from a factor analysis based on Pvote and Respn (Assn and Nccs) to measure the strength of cooperative norms (density of social networks) in a county, creating the variable, namely, Cooperative norm (Social network). 15 We modify the baseline model by replacing Social capital with Cooperative norm and Social network. Table 10 presents the regression results. Across both models, the estimates on Cooperative norm are positive and significant at the 1% level. Although the estimates on Social network are also positive, they are not significant at the conventional levels. These findings afford two tentative inferences. First, strength of social interactions need not encourage innovation because it could be that "relationships can get so strong that the community becomes complacent and insulated from outside information and challenges." (Florida, Cushing, and Gates, 2002, p. 20). Second, the positive social-capital-innovation linkage could be driven by strong cooperative norms, as opposed to dense social networks, surrounding corporate headquarters. 16 [Insert Table 10 here]Our main test variable, Social capital, is the first principal component from a factor analysis based on Pvote, Respn, Assn, and Nccs.

We then use the natural logarithm of one plus Trademark, namely, the variable, Log(1+Trademark), to capture trademark activity for the firms in our sample.Along with patents and copyrights, trademarks represent an important form of intellectual properties.

        <p>This study highlights the linkage between corporate innovation and a specific construct that captures social norms and social networks arising from the social environment surrounding a firm's corporate headquarter location, namely, social capital. It goes beyond prior research that examines the specific social-capital-innovation linkage (see footnote 3 for a summary of this stream of research) by providing robust, large-sample, firm-level evidence using patent-based and citation-based innovation measures and using a social capital construct that goes beyond "the relational side of social capital". Specifically, we use a social capital construct that takes into consideration not only the effect of social interactions as captured by density of associational networks but also the effect of cooperative norms as captured by voter turnout and census participation.This study highlights the linkage between corporate innovation and a specific construct that captures social norms and social networks arising from the social environment surrounding a firm's corporate headquarter location, namely, social capital.

        <p>Additionally, our study provides evidence that informs a nascent research stream that explores the influences of external environment, including both influences of religious and social environment, on corporate innovation outputs (e.g., Chen, Podolski, Rhee, and Veeraraghavan, 2014;Benabou, Ticchi, and Vindigni, 2015) and, more broadly, on corporate decisions (e.g., Hilary and Hui, 2009;Hasan, Hoi, Wu, and Zhang, 2017a;Hoi, Wu, and Zhang, 2018). In this light, our study adds to a fruitful line of research that enriches the understanding of how social environment, including but not limited to social capital, affects corporations, including but not limited to corporate innovation.Additionally, our study provides evidence that informs a nascent research stream that explores the influences of external environment, including both influences of religious and social environment, on corporate innovation outputs (e.g., Chen, Podolski, Rhee, and Veeraraghavan, 2014;Benabou, Ticchi, and Vindigni, 2015) and, more broadly, on corporate decisions (e.g., Hilary and Hui, 2009;Hasan, Hoi, Wu, and Zhang, 2017a;Hoi, Wu, and Zhang, 2018).

        <p>To the extent that corporate innovation is value-enhancing (Kogan, Papanikolaou, Seru, and Stoffman, 2017), our results point to an important insight that social environment in local areas surrounding corporate headquarters could help to promote the interests of shareholders. In particular, our findings reveal two channels through which social capital relates to corporate innovation. Social capital relates to innovation by allaying the contracting problems in innovation within the firm and by easing firm access to external financing. These results corroborate the findings of Hoi, Wu, and Zhang (2019) All estimates are based on ordinary least squares regressions of the baseline model with modifications as specified below. In all regressions the sampling period is 1992-2010. Panel A uses four alternate dependent variables to gauge innovation performance. Patent/R&amp;D and Patent/total employees are the total number of patents a firm filed in a given year scaled by the firm's R&amp;D investment in that year and the total number of employees of the firm in that year, respectively. Log(1+NS_citation) and Log(1+T_citation) are alternate measures of citation performance, where Log is natural logarithm, NS_citation is the total number of citations from other companies a firm received for the new patents it filed in a given year, and T_citation is the total sum of the scaled citation count across all new patents a firm filed in a given year. Scaled citation is the total number of citations from each patent scaled by the average citation count of all patents in the same technology class in the same year. Panel B uses four alternate dependent variables to gauge patent and citation performance. Log(1+Patent+3) and Log(1+Citation+3) are the total number new patents a firm filed in year t+3 and the total number of citations a firm received from these patents, where t indicates the year in which Social capital is measured. Citation_3 (Citation_5) is the total number of citations a firm received in year t+1 to year t+3 (year t+1 to year t+5) for all the patents a firm filed in year t. The sample for Panels A and B contains up to 22,010 firm-year observations from 2,142 unique firms. Panel C report results using a reduced sample that includes only data for the years 1990, 1997, 2005, and 2009 in which social capital data from NRCRD are actually available. Corresponding innovation data for these regressions are observed in 1992, 1998, 2006, and 2010, respectively. The sample contains 4,363 observations. Panel D reports annual regression results based on each of the years in which NRCRD data are available. Panel E uses an alternate measure for social capital, A1_social capital, which is constructed using a linear interpolation method. The corresponding sample contains 18,037 firm-year observations. All controls include firm-level and county-level variables plus Urban and Hot spot as specified in the baseline regression model of Eq. ( 1). The sample contains 615 firm-year observations from 119 unique firms with a single social-capital-changing relocation event during the period 1995-2007. Of these, 54 firms experienced a social-capital-increasing relocation and 65 experienced a social-capital-decreasing relocation. A three-year window straddling both sides of the relocation event is used. Sampled firms must have at least one year of data available in the three-year window before and the three-year window after the relocation. A total of 344 firm-year observations are from the pre-relocation window and a total of 271 firm-years are from the post-relocation window. Panel A presents diagnostics on firm attributes across the subsample of 54 firms with a social-capital-increasing relocation and the subsample of 65 firms with a social-capital-decreasing relocation. The data are based on firm-year observations of these two subsamples in the year immediately preceding the relocation. Estimates in Panel B are based on ordinary least squares regressions. The dependent variables are Log(1+Patent) and Log(1+Citation). All independent variables are as specified in the baseline regression models in Eq. ( 1), except that Social capital is replaced with Post, Increasing relocation, and Post × Increasing relocation. Post equals one if a firm-year observation is from post-relocation window; it equals zero otherwise. Increasing relocation equals one if a firm experienced a social-capital-increasing relocation during the period 1995-2007; it equals zero if a firm experienced a social-capital-decreasing relocation during the period 1995-2007. All controls include firm attributes and county demographics as specified in the baseline regression models in Eq. ( 1 (1+Citation). Social capital captures the joint effect of social networks and cooperative norms across US counties. Regressions in Panel A are based on a sample of 18,660 firm-years for which the requisite material subsidiary data are available. Geographically diversified firms equals one if a firm has material subsidiaries in at least three different states in a given year, and it equals zero otherwise. The sample in Panel B consists of 12,860 firm-years for which additional data for employee concerns from KLD are available. Employee concern equals one if the total number of concerns in employee relations is greater than zero (the sample median); it equals zero otherwise. A concern is a weakness in employee relations over one of five categories including union relation, health and safety, workforce reduction, retirement benefit, and supply chain controversies based on KLD data in employee relations. Organization capital is calculated by cumulating inflation-adjusted selling and general administrative expenditures using a perpetual inventory method. All controls include firm-level and county-level variables plus Urban and Hot spot as specified in the baseline regression model of Eq. ( 1).

We use this database rather than the National Bureau of Economics Research patent database complied byHall, Jaffe and Trajtenberg (2001) because it contains recent data on patents. Additionally, the KPSS data are advantageous because patent assignees are matched with publicly listed firms with available data in CRSP up to the year of 2010. Furthermore, we supplement KPSS data with additional patent data in 2010 collected from USPTO.The KPSS patent database is based on information from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and from Google Patents.

        <p>, Social capital is the first principal component from a principal component analysis based on Pvote, Respn, Nccs, and Assn in the years of 1990, 1997, 2005, and 2009, respectively. Data for missing years are back-filled using estimates in the preceding year in which data are available. For example, we fill in missing data for Social capital from 1992 to 1996 using Social capital estimates in 1990. Number of sport clubs, managers, and promoters 1 Nccs: We observe significant discrepancies in the reported Nccs values between the OLD_NRCRD and the NEW_NRCRD in 1997. There are two reasons. First, the OLD_NRCRD includes all non-profit organizations, but the NEW_NRCRD excludes non-profits with an international reach. Second, the OLD_NRCRD data might be incomplete as they report many counties with very few non-profit organizations in 1990. Accordingly, we use the 1997 and 2005 Nccs data from NEW_NRCRD and estimate the 1990 Nccs data as follows. Estimated 1990 Nccs = 1997 Nccs ÷ (1 + Average growth rate of Nccs between 1997Nccs between and 2005Nccs between and between 2005Nccs between and 2009)), where Nccs data from the left-hand side of the equation are based on data from NEW_NRCRD. We use this procedure because there is an upward trend in the number of non-profit organizations from 1997 to 2005 as reported in NEW_NRCRD. The mean numbers of non-profit organizations in NEW_NRCRD are 354 and 443 for the years of 1997 and 2005, respectively. 2 Assn: We use the data for the 10 types of social organizations as listed in the table above to calculate the sum of social organizations because these are the organizations that are consistently reported in both the OLD_NRCRD and the NEW_NRCRD. The OLD_NRCRD includes additional information for organizations such as membership sports and recreation clubs in 1990 and 1997, but NEW_NRCRD no longer carries the information for these organizations in 2005.
