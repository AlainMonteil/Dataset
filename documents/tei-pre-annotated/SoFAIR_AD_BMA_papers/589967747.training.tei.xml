        <p>Despite an abundance of research, still there is a gap in understanding the underlying cultural mechanisms behind entrepreneurial behavior of nations in the literature. This study contributes to the debate through a new perspective of analysis based on behavioral reasoning theory (BRT). Specifically, this research analyses the role cultural values play in formation of the reasoning behind entrepreneurial behavior. The data and variables are taken from the GLOBE project and the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) for a multiple regression analysis spanning from 2007 to 2017 for 50 countries. The results show that, with the exception of Institutional Collectivism, all of GLOBE's cultural dimensions affect the reasoning justifications behind entrepreneurial intentions in various countries. Thus, the novel contribution of the present research is the application of BRT in explaining entrepreneurial intentions. This contribution is substantial to the international entrepreneurship field through clarification of the role of cultural values in the reasoning processes behind entrepreneurial activities of nations. Some findings are surprising with regard to the conventional understandings. These findings are fully discussed in the concluding sections.</p>
        <p>was the first author who questioned how values affect entrepreneurship. A century later, the Weberian question is still a hot debate in the entrepreneurship research (Calvelli, Cannavale, Parmentola, &amp; Tutore, 2014;Cannavale &amp; Wallis, 2015;Coviello, McDougall, &amp; Oviatt, 2011;Liñán &amp; Fayolle, 2015;Stephan &amp; Uhlaner, 2010). Most pertinent studies provide evidence about the association between entrepreneurship and cultural values, which are specific to each group of people and create personality traits and motives among them (Hofstede, 1980;House, Hanges, Javidan, Dorfman, &amp; Gupta, 2004;Schwartz, 1994). However, these studies result in different and sometimes contrasting conclusions (Shneor, Camgöz, &amp; Karapinar, 2013). Engelen, Heinemann, and Brettel (2009) claimed that more effort was needed to develop a consistent theory in this field. This desperate need for theoretical development of culture-entrepreneurship research was later reiterated by Paul and Shrivatava (2016). In the meanwhile, some scholars referred to various knowledge gaps that existed in understanding how culture affects entrepreneurship (Chand &amp; Ghorbani, 2011;Lim, Oh, &amp; Clercq, 2016;Liu &amp; Almor, 2016). In parallel, Jones, Coviello, and Tang (2011), who reviewerd the international entrepreneuship literature, including culture-entrepreneurship issue, believed that this "field is described as phenomenally based, potentially fragmented and suffering from theoretical paucity" (p. 632). More recently, Laffranchinia, Kim, and Posthuma (2018) pointed out the need for understanding how culture influences the relationship between entrepreneurial cognition and actual entrepreneurship activities. Specifically, the cognitive mechanisms in which culture affects entrepreneurial behaviors is still a significant gap in this area of research according to Pathak and Muralidharan (2018).</p>
        <p>The stream of entrepreneurial cognition research provides scholars with many theories and methods for a clearer understanding of the effects of deep, basic beliefs and values on intentions to act entrepreneurially (Krueger, 2007). Within this stream, the theory of reasoned action (TRA), by Fishbein and Ajzen (1975), and the theory of planned behavior (TPB), by Ajzen (1991), are the most utilized theories of social psychology (Liñán &amp; Fayolle, 2015;Lortie &amp; Castogiovanni, 2015). These theories explain deep beliefs and global motives underlying decisions and actions. Therefore, the abundance of research about underlying cognitions of entrepreneurial intentions that used TRA and TPB contributed a lot to this domain of study. However, they simply fail to bring up the concept of "reasoning" behind those entrepreneurial cognitions. As a consequence, the research lacks any opinion about how people find reasons for entrepreneurial intention and also reasons against it. While, behavioral reasoning theory (BRT) conceptualizes the role of reasons in regards to specific intentions. BRT posits that reasons, as the means of explanation and justification of behaviors, are influenced by beliefs and values, and at the same time, they impact global motives and intentions (Westaby, 2005). Addressing two types of reasons (for and against specific intentions), BRT offers an insight into complex reasoning processes, and gives the possibility to comprehend complex decision-making processes getting an idea of the factors that might accelerate or limit the action phase because of the way they affect the formation of intentions. BRT is a novel theory to be employed in the field of entrepreneurship (Miralles, Giones, &amp; Gozun, 2017). Moreover, it can be of specific theoretical contributions about the effects of cultural values on the reasoning behind entrepreneurial intention (EI) and activity in various countries. Previous studies mostly utilized the other theoretical frameworks, including TPB, to explain the entrepreneurial intentions (Liñán &amp; Fayolle, 2015) while our study focuses on a novel theoretical framework, named BRT, through which entrepreneurial intention is explained more comprehensively by considering the role of cognitive reasoning processes people employ in their intentions and actions. Thus, BRT could shed new light on the apparent contrasting effects of cultural values. This study provides answer to this research question as its main contribution to the culture-entrepreneurship debate based on BRT:</p>
        <p>RQ: How do cultural values affect entrepreneurial cognitions and behaviour (including reasons, intention, and entrepreneurial activity) at country level?</p>
        <p>To provide response to the above question, a positivist analysis of the data from GLOBE and GEM will be quantitatively performed to test the proposed hypotheses. By doing so, our study presents a novel approach for understanding the association between culture and entrepreneurship. Also, it offers substantial findings for international entrepreneurship researchers who seek to understand how cultural values affect the cognitions behind entrepreneurial intentions at country level. These findings are to some extend surprising, that are fully discussed in the concluding sections.</p>
        <p>First in 1934, Joseph Schumpeter, the political economist, noted that entrepreneurs are individuals of specific traits and characteristics. He emphasized that only some people enjoy from such characteristics. He also believed that expansion of entrepreneurial activity depends on both entrepreneurial climate and prospective entrepreneurs. Later in 1985, Peter Drucker, the influential author in business arena, stated that the literature on entrepreneurship branches into two streams: one focusing on traits and characteristics of entrepreneurs, while the other is mostly concerned with the behaviour of entrepreneurs. Shapero's (1982) model is now considered as an important step forward in the second stream. Through the same stream, Bird (1988) theoretically attempted to provide the behavioral model of entrepreneurial intentions that helped to distinguish entrepreneurial activity from strategic management. In another considerable contribution to at-that-time newly-born concept of 'psychology of the entrepreneur', Shaver and Scott (1991) shed light on the importance of personal attributes and cognition, as well as behavioral choices in entrepreneurship domain.</p>
        <p>Then, Ajzen (1991) developed the social psychology theory of planned behavior (TPB). Later, Krueger and Carsrud (1993) theorized the application of TPB in entrepreneurship domain. In an attempt to reconcile Shapero's model with TPB, Krueger and Brazeal (1994) shed light on the concept of potential entrepreneurs as individuals with the tendency to launch their own business in the near future. In parallel, Boyd and Vozikis (1994) developed Bird's model of intentions in convergence with TPB, which consequently became the dominant theory in the field of behavioral models. Mitchell et al. (2002) called for more attention by researchers to the people side of entrepreneurship. They believed that the entrepreneurial decision-making process, by entrepreneurs as 'people', was missing in entrepreneurship research. Five years later, Mitchell et al. (2007) reported that entrepreneurial cognition research was still embryonic. They reiterated their call for a "growing community of entrepreneurship researchers from across multiple disciplines to further develop the 'thinking-doing' link in entrepreneurship research" (Mitchell et al., 2007, p. 2).</p>
        <p>From a different perspective, Krueger (2007) argued that human learning process (including entrepreneurial learning) is inherently constructivist. Therefore, he called for a better understanding of entrepreneurship by delving into entrepreneurial intentions, attitudes, cognitive structures, and deep beliefs (Krueger, 2007, p. 124). He concluded that cognitive sciences provide entrepreneurship researchers with an ocean of new methods suitable for exploration of the phenomenon for many years (Krueger, 2007, p. 134).</p>
        <p>Another researcher who emphasized the human side of entrepreneurship was Baron (2007). He theorized the possible influence of behavioral and cognitive aspects of entrepreneurs on the process of entrepreneurship, and built on the concept that entrepreneurship appears to be depended on the people who act entrepreneurially (Shane, Locke, &amp; Collins, 2003).</p>
        <p>For more than two decades, research on cognitive aspects of entrepreneurship has substantially focused on the application of the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) by Fishbein and Ajzen (1975) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) by Ajzen (1991). In general, these theories are the most applied theories of intention in the relevant literature (Kolvereid &amp; Isaksen, 2006;van Gelderen et al., 2008;Engle et al., 2010;Kautonen, van Gelderen, &amp; Tornikoski, 2013;Hattab, 2014;Heuer &amp; Kolvereid, 2014;Entrialgo &amp; Iglesias, 2018). The literature review performed by Liñán and Fayolle (2015) revealed that TPB became the most important theory in entrepreneurial intention research inspired by the study of Krueger and Brazeal (1994).</p>
        <p>A great part of entrepreneurial cognition field of study is focused on examination of the role of country culture (Alon, Lerner, &amp; Shoham, 2016;Bouncken, Zagvozdina, &amp; Golze, 2009;Dheer &amp; Lenartowicz, 2016;Dodd, Jack, &amp; Anderson, 2013;Engle, Schlaegel, &amp; Dimirriadi, 2011;Liñán &amp; Chen, 2009;Liñán, Urbano, &amp; Guerrero, 2011;Schlaegel, He, &amp; Engle, 2013). Terjesen, Hessels, and Li (2016) pointed out many research opportunities in this field, such as the examination of the role of institutions (including culture) on entrepreneurial activities of individuals at a national level. Pathak and Muralidharan (2018) stated that the role of culture is attracting more scholars, although the underlying mechanisms through which entrepreneurial behaviours are shaped have not been fully understood in this area. Indeed, there is a gap about the role of informal institutions, such as culture, in entrepreneurship. The purpose of this research is to understand the role of cultural values in entrepreneurial cognitions according to behavioral reasoning theory as a novel theory from social psychology.</p>
        <p>Behavioral Reasoning Theory (BRT), rooted in the explanationbased model (Pennington &amp; Hastie, 1988) and the reasons theory (Westaby &amp; Fishbein, 1996), was introduced by Westaby in 2005.</p>
        <p>The overarching difference between BRT and the previous theories (such as TRA and TPB) is that BRT brings up the concept of 'reasons' (Westaby, 2005;Westaby, Probst, &amp; Lee, 2010). Westaby (2005) defined reasons as 'the specific subjective factors people use to explain their anticipated behavior' (p. 100).</p>
        <p>BRT also distinguishes beliefs form reasons. Beliefs "refer to a person's subjective probability judgments concerning some discriminable aspect of his world" (Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975, p. 131), but reasons are the explanations people employ in defending their behavioral choices (Westaby, 2005). For example, an individual values the choice to become an entrepreneur because he believes that good business opportunities exist and that self-affirmation is important to him. This is a belief. However, he decides not to pursue the opportunities because of some problems related to his family and the necessity to get a regular, although limited, income. This is a reason. In BRT, there are some reasons for performing specific behaviours and some against it. This novelty that BRT provides to the social psychology could be of specific value for the entrepreneurial cognitions research stream, since TRA and TPB do not bring up the concept of reasons. While, application of BRT can contribute to the literature by scrutiny of reasons for and against entrepreneurial behavioral choices.</p>
        <p>Researchers have addressed the topic of entrepreneurial reasoning process from various angles, not including the novel aspect that BRT posits. Teal and Carroll (1999) proposed that entrepreneurs enjoy from higher moral reasoning skills than non-entrepreneurs do. Sarasvathy (2001b) conceptualized the distinction between effectual and causal reasoning processes in the field of entrepreneurship. Sarasvathy (2001a) performed an empirical study of 27 entrepreneurs and found out that most entrepreneurs mobilize effectual reasoning in their cognitive processes. Cornelissen and Clarke (2010) further analysed the reasoning by entrepreneurs arguing that new venture creation consists of inductive reasoning. Moreover, inductive reasoning is shaped by experience and by the motivation to tolerate uncertainty (Cornelissen &amp; Clarke, 2010). Furthermore, Grégoire, Barr, and Shepherd (2010) analysed the reasoning strategies of entrepreneurs to describe why some people detect those opportunities that other people cannot see. Whereas various types of reasoning have been studied in regards to entrepreneurship, BRT has not been among these.</p>
        <p>Since its development, BRT has received attention by many scholars in different fields of research, such as innovation adoption (Claudy, Garcia, &amp; O'Driscoll, 2015), leadership (Westaby et al., 2010), and consumer behavior (Gupta &amp; Arora, 2017;Paul, Modi, &amp; Patel, 2016;Ryan &amp; Casidy, 2018). Our review of the literature about BRT lead us to the fact that it is still a totally new perspective of analysis in entrepreneurship research. Miralles et al. (2017), as the only direct study of BRT in the entrepreneurship domain, examined a modified model of intentions considering the influence of previous experience as a moderator in the linkages in BRT. Still, the work of Miralles et al. (2017) did not take the concept of reasoning from BRT into consideration. Hence, we believe operationalization of BRT brings new insight into the related literature that is of specific theoretical value. BRT is a theory derived from social psychology domain. Therefore, it can provide a suitable and robust tool for examination of the association between cultural values and entrepreneurial cognitions at social level. Also, psychological traits approach confirms application of BRT in the field of entrepreneurship. According to this approach, the higher the pro-entrepreneurial cultural values in a society are, there would be more entrepreneurial intention among individuals living in that society (Davidsson, 1995;Thurik &amp; Dejardin, 2011). In the following sections, the framework of this research is developed based on the BRT.</p>
        <p>Throughout the literature on cognitive models of entrepreneurship, some scholars have examined direct as well as moderating effects of cultural values on entrepreneurship (Bouncken et al., 2009;Liñán &amp; Chen, 2009;Liñán, Urbano, &amp; Guerrero, 2011;Schlaegel et al., 2013). Cultural values are defined as the shared ideals and long-term goals of being (Stephan &amp; Pathak, 2016) that develop certain personality traits and motives (Hofstede, 1980;Schwartz, 1994). They impact on the people's desire for achievement. They also create motivations among people toward initiatives (Baughn &amp; Neupert, 2003). Values determine risk taking and proactiveness that push people to launch businesses (Busenitz &amp; Lau, 1996;Kreiser, Marino, Dickson, &amp; Weaver, 2010;Lee &amp; Peterson, 2000;McGrath, MacMillan, &amp; Scheinberg, 1992, 1992;Mitchell, Smith, Seawright, &amp; Morse, 2000;Mueller &amp; Thomas, 2001). And they also guide social groups' evaluations of personal initiatives (Baughn &amp; Neupert, 2003). It is known from the literature that difference in cultural values of various societies produces various levels of entrepreneurial intentions and activities (Bruton, Ahlstrom, &amp; Li, 2010;Turró, Urbano, &amp; Peris-Ortiz, 2014).</p>
        <p>In the last two decades, cross-cultural entrepreneurship emerged, devoted to understanding of the effects of cultural norms and values on entrepreneurship in international arena (Engelen et al., 2009). Most cross-cultural entrepreneurship contributions refer to Hofstede's cultural dimensions (Baughn &amp; Neupert, 2003;Hayton, George, &amp; Zahra, 2002;Hofstede et al., 2004;Hunt &amp; Levie, 2003;Pinillos &amp; Reyes, 2011;Wennekers, van Stel, Thurik, &amp; Reynolds, 2005). On the basis of Hofstede's model, scholars claimed that high power distance, individualism, and masculinity and low degree of uncertainty avoidance create higher entrepreneurial orientation (McGrath, MacMillan, Scheinberg et al., 1992;McGrath, MacMillan, Yang, &amp; Tsai, 1992). On the same hand, Mueller and Thomas (2000) and McGrath, MacMillan, Scheinberg et al. (1992) showed that individualism positively associates with entrepreneurial orientation. However, Ardichvili and Gasparishvili (2003) found no significant association between the two, and Baum et al. (1993) hypothesized a reverse effect of individualism on entrepreneurship. Baum et al. (1993) argued that people cannot satisfy their personal needs in collectivist societies and thus they have a positive opinion to self-employment, which is an important motivation for new start-ups.</p>
        <p>In the last decade, scholars have started referring more consistently to the GLOBE project (Alon, Lerner, &amp; Shoham, 2016;Autio, Pathak, &amp; Wennberg, 2013;Canestrino, Ćwiklicki, Magliocca, &amp; Pawełek, 2020;Castillo-Palacio, Batista-Canino, &amp; Zúñiga Collazos, 2017;Johnstone et al., 2018;Koenig, Frese, Steinmetz, Rauch, &amp; Wang, 2007;Laspita, Breugst, Heblich, &amp; Patzelt, 2012;Rauch et al., 2013;Stephan &amp; Uhlaner, 2010;Zhao, Li, &amp; Rauch, 2012). Rauch et al. (2013) found out that assertiveness has a negative effect on female entrepreneurship, while in-group collectivism, and power distance have a positive effects on TEA and on female entrepreneurship. Stephan and Uhlaner (2010) claimed positive impact of future orientation, uncertainty avoidance, performance orientation, and humane orientation, and negative effect of assertiveness. Similar results have been reached by Zhao et al. (2012), who found a positive impact of in-group collectivism, humane orientation, low uncertainty avoidance and low gender egalitarianism on early-stage entrepreneurial activity (Calvelli et al., 2014). Alon et al. (2016) also found a positive effect of collectivism, but their findings were opposite to the formers with regard to uncertainty avoidance.</p>
        <p>Despite many studies on cultural values and entrepreneurship, there is no agreement in the literature. Findings of these studies are mixed and contrasting (Shneor et al., 2013). Stephan and Pathak (2016), who also admitted existence of mixed findings in the literature, suggested that cultural values should be specifically redefined. This helps overcome the lack of consensus, according to them, based on the fact that entrepreneurship is a specific behavior while cultural values are broad and general concepts. In contrast to Stephan and Pathak (2016), we believe that entrepreneurship is also a broad and complex behavior mainly determined by underlying cultural and cognitive mechanisms. Thus, we propose to specifically focus on the cognitive antecedents of entrepreneurial behaviors of nations, too. Behavioral reasoning theory provides us with a robust tool to perform an analysis about the effects of cultural values on entrepreneurial cognitions and behaviors of nations.</p>
        <p>In order to consider the impact of cultural values on the 'reasons for' and "reasons against" entrepreneurship rates in various countries, we refer to the GLOBE project's 'should-be' scores (House et al., 2004). We chose to base our study on the GLOBE instead of Hofstede because of several significant strengths of the project. First, GLOBE can be considered as one of the four main cross-cultural projects due to the quantity of direct observation and the relatively recent time period in which it was conducted, thus reinforcing the validity of the data (Hofstede, 2006). Second, it offers more updated data and higher number of values than the latter, and this ficilitates the investigattion of more values in societies under study (Calza, Cannavale, &amp; Tutore, 2016;Canestrino et al., 2020). In addition, by measuring the preferences about the behavior of others, the GLOBE scholars are able to build predictors of culture's effects (Smith, 2006), which is in alignment with the aim of our study on entrepreneurial intention.</p>
        <p>According to the GLOBE project, culture is the practices and values shared among people in a society: cultural practices (as is) measure how people perceive of the present culture, while cultural values (should be) measure how they wish the culture to change (House et al., 2004). Because of their rigorous measurements (Javidan, House, Dorfman, Hanges, &amp; de Luque, 2006), should-be scores are able to give a proxy of the prevailing values characterizing contexts and can be considered to verify how cultural values affect 'reasons for' and 'reasons against' EI. We decided to focus on "should be" scores, because we are interested in the normative effect of culture on the reasoning behind formation of intentions. As highlighted by (Hanges &amp; Dickson, 2004) should be scores can be considered as measures of values. While values are the principles that guide behaviors (Maseland &amp; Van Hoorn, 2009). They have been extensively employed in management research, however; some scholars have been sceptical about the appropriateness of should be scores. While, should be scores have been considered as shaped patterns of behavior, and therefore as measures of cultural values (Alon, Lerner, &amp; Shoham, 2016;Brewer &amp; Venaik, 2010, 2011;Maseland &amp; Van Hoorn, 2009;Smith, 2006).</p>
        <p>The authors of the GLOBE measured values -'should be scores' -in nine cultural dimensions of: uncertainty avoidance, future orientation, power distance, institutional collectivism, in-group collectivism, humane orientation, performance orientation, gender egalitarianism, and assertiveness.</p>
        <p>Uncertainty Avoidance (UA), according to the GLOBE, indicates individuals' intolerance of ambiguity. Cornelissen and Clarke (2010) argued that the motivation to resolve uncertainty reinforces the inductive process of reasoning in the creation of novel ventures and entrepreneurial activities. In addition, Hofstede et al. (2004) found out that uncertainty avoidance increases entrepreneurship rates because people look at entrepreneurial activities as a way to reduce their dissatisfaction. However, many studies show a negative relationship between UA and entrepreneurial motivation (Baughn &amp; Neupert, 2003;Busenitz &amp; Lau, 1996;Hayton et al., 2002;Kreiser et al., 2010;Lee &amp; Peterson, 2000;McGrath, MacMillan, Scheinberg et al., 1992;Mueller &amp; Thomas, 2001;Shane &amp; Venkataraman, 2000;Thomas &amp; Mueller, 2000;Yetim &amp; Yetim, 2006). This is mostly due to the fact that entrepreneurs are risk-takers who do not avoid uncertainty.</p>
        <p>McGrath, MacMillan, Scheinberg et al. (1992) also found a negative association between entrepreneurship and uncertainty avoidance since entrepreneurship is a risky activity and entrepreneurs have a more positive attitude toward risk than non-entrepreneurs do. In addition, prior research declares that uncertainty avoidance, as well as the fear of possible barriers, limits entrepreneurial activity and the creation of new ventures (Bouncken et al., 2009;Dwyer, Mesak, &amp; Hsu, 2005).</p>
        <p>In societies with high scores on future orientation (FO), individuals are highly motivated and organizations have a longer strategic orientation (House et al., 2004). Long-term orientation is theoretically proposed to be related to higher innovativeness, proactiveness, and autonomy of family businesses (Lumpkin, Brigham, &amp; Moss, 2010). Future-oriented societies value the efforts of successful entrepreneurs. Planning, hard work, and delayed gratification are characteristics of such societies.</p>
        <p>Power Distance (PD) reflects the degree to which a society accepts power differences and privileges (House et al., 2004). Throughout the literature on international entrepreneurship, PD is found to have mixed influences on entrepreneurship. House et al. (2004) pointed out that PD can increase individuals' job dissatisfaction and pushes people toward entrepreneurship. However, other scholars find a negative association between PD and entrepreneurship (Kreiser et al., 2010;Lee &amp; Peterson, 2000). Also, PD research is problematic regarding entrepreneurial intentions. Vinogradov and Kolvereid (2007) found out immigrants from higher PD cultures are less likely to become self-employed. similarly, Shneor et al. (2013) compared entrepreneurial intentions of two opposite cultures, characterized by high vs. low PD. In a clear contradiction to Vinogradov and Kolvereid (2007), findings of Shneor et al. (2013) indicated that higher PD provides better conditions for entrepreneurial intentions.</p>
        <p>Scholars do not agree on the impact of collectivism on entrepreneurship. Lee and Peterson (2000), as well as McGrath, MacMillan, Yang et al. (1992), explained that in countries with a high level of in-group collectivism people are discouraged from individual initiatives. On the contrary, other authors claim that collectivism has a positive impact on entrepreneurship because building a new business is considered as a way of taking care of others (Baum et al., 1993;Pinillos &amp; Reyes, 2011). Other researchers found no significant relation between individualism/collectivism and entrepreneurship (Stephan &amp; Uhlaner, 2010). Indeed, Tiessen (1997) noted that individualism and collectivism are not the two extremes of the continuum in regard to entrepreneurship. It is vital to know, however, that collectivists are motivated by the group's implicit norms, and that contradicts with what individualists are motivated by (Ouchi, 1980(Ouchi, , 1982;;Wilkins &amp; Ouchi, 1983). Moreover, results of the empirical analysis by Bouncken et al. (2009) as well as by Pinillos and Reyes (2011) showed that the impacts of collectivism and individualism on entrepreneurial activities differ according to the context. House et al. (2004) divided collectivism into Institutional collectivism (Col I) and In-group Collectivism (Col II). Col I is the degree to which institutions encourage collective action, while Col II refers to the degree of individuals' loyalty to groups and families (House et al., 2004). Morris, Davis, and Allen (1994) conceptualized the positive and negative impacts of collectivism on the development of entrepreneurship at organizations. According to them, loss of personal self to the group, emotional dependence of individuals on the group or organization, and less personal responsibility for outcomes are listed among the negative impacts of collectivism on entrepreneurial activities. They also provided a list of positive influences of collectivism on entrepreneurship, among which are: greater synergies from combined efforts, ability to incorporate diverse perspectives and achieve comprehensive views, fewer interpersonal conflicts, equally shared credit for failure and success, teamwork, and steady progress (Morris et al., 1994). This view indicates both pros and cons of collectivism in entrepreneurship simultaneously. Thus, the impact of collectivism on entrepreneurship is complex.</p>
        <p>Humane Orientation (HO) measures how much each society encourages and rewards fairness, altruism, generosity, and kindness to others (Gelbrich, Stedham, &amp; Gäthke, 2016;House et al., 2004). Just a few scholars have investigated the effects of HO on entrepreneurship.</p>
        <p>Stephan and Uhlaner (2010) associated HO with Socially Supportive Culture (SSC) and found a positive relationship between HO and entrepreneurship. Similarly, Zhao et al. (2012) associated HO with traditionalism in society and assumed a positive effect of HO on entrepreneurship, given that traditionalism may help people deal with the risks of entrepreneurship through social support. From another perspective, if we look at the conceptualization of the GLOBE HO dimension, House et al. (2004) highlighted that in HO societies, the need to belonging and being affiliated is the dominant motivation (House et al., 2004). This dominant motivation of HO societies does not increase 'reasons for' entrepreneurial intention. This is in line with Schwartz (1992), who analysed the prevailing norms of societies according to the dichotomy of self-transcendence and self-enhancement. According to the theory of basic values (Schwartz, 1992), extreme selftranscendence is associated with altruism, benevolence, and universalism; while extreme self-enhancement values consist of power, achievement, and hedonism. Entrepreneurial activities conceptually lie in the territory of the latter.</p>
        <p>Improvements, results, performance, and targets are important issues in societies with a high Performance Orientation (PO). Stephan and Uhlaner (2010) defined higher order cultural norms of socially supportive vs. performance-based culture (PBC). Results of their study indicate that PBC predicts demand-side variables of entrepreneurship, such as 'opportunity existence' and 'quality of formal institutions to support entrepreneurship'. Although PBC does not directly affect entrepreneurship, cultures oriented towards performance provide demands for entrepreneurial activities.</p>
        <p>High PO societies are result-driven, characterized by an orientation to act and to set regular review targets. Changes in strategy and planning new action are acceptable. People are more prone to take initiative than to focus on relationships and status in such societies (House et al., 2004).</p>
        <p>According to the GLOBE, societies with higher Gender Egalitarianism (GE) minimize role differences between genders (House et al., 2004). The contributions on this dimension are very limited. Zhao et al. (2012) found an inverse relationship between gender egalitarianism and entrepreneurship. GE is associated to Hofstede's dimension of masculinity vs. feminity, which considers two different aspects of societies: the inclination to be assertive and goal oriented, and the perception of role differences and inequalities (House et al., 2004). Scholars generally agree on the positive relationship between masculinity and entrepreneurship (McGrath, MacMillan, Scheinberg et al., 1992;Mueller, 2004;Hofstede et al., 2004).</p>
        <p>In addition, Gupta, Turban, Wasti, and Sikdar (2009), who performed an interesting study about gender stereotypes and entrepreneurial intentions among adults of three nations (India, Turkey, and the US), found that entrepreneurship is viewed as masculine in general and entrepreneurs are predominantly recognized to have masculine characteristics. Their findings, when controlled for female-entrepreneurship congruence, indicated that entrepreneurial intentions of men are higher than women.</p>
        <p>Assertiveness (ASS) refers to people who are dominant, assertive, and tough (House et al., 2004). According to the GLOBE, societies that score high on assertiveness value competition, success and progress, and believe that anybody can be successful in case of hard work. Assertive societies value taking initiative, and having control over the environment. In addition, as mentioned before, ASS is a specific trait of masculine societies, normally considered supportive of entrepreneurship.</p>
        <p>In assertive societies, individuals emphasize results over relationships. They expect demanding and challenging results, and the desire for self-affirmation makes them more decisive.</p>
        <p>This study investigates the influences of cultural values on the psychological reasoning processes behind country level entrepreneurial behaviors according to BRT. But what are the 'reasons for' and 'against' entrepreneurial activities that people employ in their decision-making processes? The need for achievement is a 'reason for' entrepreneurship, since entrepreneurs are high achievers (Dinis, do Paco, Ferreira, Raposo, &amp; Rodrigues, 2013). According to the theory of needs, the need for achievement drives people to excel, to achieve standards, and to strive to succeed (Clark &amp; McClelland, 1956;Liu &amp; Arendt, 2016;McClelland, 1985). BRT postulates that reasons are the explanations and justifications that people apply when defending their intentions and actions. Therefore, societies that give high social status to successful entrepreneurs, as high achievers (Dinis et al., 2013), create role models for individuals to follow and thus to find good reasoning for entrepreneurship activity, since they are in fact promoting the need for success/achievement/status through entrepreneurship among their people. In this study, the GEM indicator, 'High status to successful entrepreneurs', is considered as the 'reason for' entrepreneurship, i.e. as a 'reason for' a high level of entrepreneurial intention (EI).</p>
        <p>Another indicator of GEM, called the 'fear of failure' rate, is assumed to provide a strong 'reason against' entrepreneurship. In contrast to high social status to successful entrepreneurs, that is assumed here as a proxy of 'reason for', people might recoil at the idea of their business establishment since the risks of such activity may seem considerably high to them. Simply, people, who have even a positive attitude about entrepreneurship and also opportunities do exist for them, might intend not to launch their own business based on the fact that they are afraid of high risks of failure. These people might explain their intention through the fear of failure as a strong 'reason against' entrepreneurship. Thus, fear of failure is considered also as a proxy of 'reason against' entrepreneurship with a negative effect on EI.</p>
        <p>According to BRT, illustrated in Fig. 1, behaviour is formed through intention to act, that is in turn affected by motives, reasons, beliefs and values. In BRT, beliefs and values are the deepest cognitive variables that form intention. Moreover, global motives play a significant role in formation of intention to perform specific actions and behaviours, including attitudes, norms, and perceived control. Nevertheless, the main focus of the present research is the effect of cultural values on the reasoning for and against entrepreneurial intention. It is according to the fact that the existing literature is replete with too many studies examining the role of motives in this regard, while failing to bring the reasons (for and against) into consideration, as mentioned earlier.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, this study is based on the proposed impact of values on Fig. 1. Behavioral Reasoning Theory (Westaby, 2005).</p>
        <p>F. Calza, et al. International Business Review 29 (2020) 101725</p>
        <p>reasons by BRT in the field of entrepreneurship. It is hypothesized, therefore, that cultural values affect the reasoning for and against entrepreneurship. On the other hand, reasons for and against entrepreneurship are hypothesized to respectively increase and decrease the intention to launch own business. As such, the following hypotheses are stated:</p>
        <p>H1a. Cultural values affect reason for entrepreneurship, which is presented by high status to successful entrepreneurs.</p>
        <p>H1b. High status to successful entrepreneurs, as a proxy of 'reason for' entrepreneurship, positively influences intention to act entrepreneurially.</p>
        <p>H2a. Cultural values affect reason against entrepreneurship, which is presented by fear of failure rate.</p>
        <p>H2b. Fear of failure rate, as a proxy of 'reason against' entrepreneurship, negatively influences intention to act entrepreneurially.</p>
        <p>According to the widely accepted theories of social psychology (Ajzen, 1991;Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975;Westaby, 2005;Westaby et al., 2010), we generally expect a positive effect of intentions on behaviors (acts). Also, EI is the main predictor of entrepreneurial behavior according to BRT. Thus, it is hypothesized as below that:</p>
        <p>H3. Entrepreneurial intention significantly predicts entrepreneurial behavior at country level. Fig. 2 summarizes the hypotheses and illustrates the theoretical framework of the paper.</p>
        <p>The necessary data for the analysis of this study were taken from the secondary datasets of GLOBE and GEM about cultural values and also about entrepreneurship, respectively. The GLOBE is a ten-year program, from 1994 to 2003, to study culture and also effective leadership in 62 societies (House et al., 2004). The GEM program, that was launched in 1988, provides cross-national harmonized data about entrepreneurship on annual basis aiming at determination of the factors that cause differences in the level of entrepreneurship rates among nations (Reynolds et al., 2005). Our independent variables of cultural values come from the GLOBE and our dependent variables of entrepreneurship are taken from the GEM. The overlap of the GLOBE and GEM contains 50 countries in the interval of 2007-2017. We performed a post-hoc analysis to overcome the issue of time in the overlap of GLOBE, as a cross-sectional dataset, and GEM, as a longitudinal one. This is discussed in the following sections.</p>
        <p>This study explores the effects of cultural values on the 'reasons for' and 'reasons against' EI and consequently on entrepreneurial behavior. Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) is a globally renowned body of entrepreneurship survey that gathers data from many countries using specific robust methods. In the GEM there are some variables that are suitable as proxies of some BRT variables in the field of entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurial behavior, which is the dependent variable in this study could be measured as the early-stage entrepreneurial activities of nations under investigation. This is of value to our research since we are going to understand how entrepreneurial intention brings about behaviors according to BRT. Therefore, focusing on the early stage entrepreneurship activities can assure us of the effect of intentions that are formed recently on the new-born businesses. The early stage entrepreneurship is measured by GEM as the percentage of 18-64 population who are either nascent entrepreneurs or owner-managers of a new business. This variable is called in GEM as total early-stage entrepreneurial activity (TEA). Previous research have chosen to operationalize upon TEA as the start-up activity of nations (Beynon, Jones, &amp; Pickernell, 2016). TEA is of specific importance in our research since we focus on the process of timely effects of intentions on activities in a specific field. Therefore, we would need a measurement that correctly measures recent activities that ensures us of the correct effects of intentions on them. This is mainly due to the fact that Westaby (2005) emphasized on the timely effects of the BRT variables on each other, too. Following BRT, we have assumed a positive effect of the 'reasons for' and a negative effect of the 'reasons against' on EI, measured as the percentage of 18-64 population who are latent entrepreneurs and who intend to start a business within three years. This is in line with a great portion of research to define EI in the same way as defined in GEM (Liñán, Rodríguez-Cohard, &amp; Rueda-Cantuche, 2011;Thompson, 2009). The secondary data of GLOBE and GEM are employed for measuring cultural values, entrepreneurial reasons, intentions, and rates in various countries. While GLOBE is essentially at national level, in our study GEM's Adult Population Survey (APS) data at national level are utilized for the purpose of harmony. In GEM, a specialized team performed the consolidation process of data of APS at individual level to create national level data (Reynolds et al., 2005). Validity, reliability, and richness of these data are assured by standardized collection procedures (Reynolds et al., 2005;Lim et al., 2016).</p>
        <p>Cultural values are considered as the 'should-be' scores of nine dimensions of the GLOBE Project (House et al., 2004): 'UA', 'FO', 'PD', 'Col I', 'HO', 'PO', 'Col II', 'GE', and 'ASS'.</p>
        <p>In the GEM, two variables can be considered as indicators of the Fig. 2. Research Framework.</p>
        <p>F. Calza, et al. International Business Review 29 (2020) 101725</p>
        <p>'reason for' and 'reason against' entrepreneurship at a country level: 'High Status to Successful Entrepreneurs' rate -defined as the percentage of 18-64 population who agree with the statement that in their country, successful entrepreneurs receive high status -stands for the 'reasons for', while 'Fear of failure' rate -defined as the percentage of 18-64 population perceiving good opportunities to start a business who indicate that 'fear of failure' would prevent them from setting up a business -stands for the 'reasons against'. Obviously, there is asymmetry between the GEM measurements of 'reason for' and 'reason against'. This asymmetry, is conceptualized according to the different reasons that are conceptualized in BRT, as 'anticipated reasons', 'concurrent reasons', and also 'post-hoc reasons' (Westaby, 2005). The measurement of 'reason for' provides an anticipated one, since people need to be motivated prior to the decision of entrepreneurial activity. While, the fear of failure as a proxy for 'reason against' entrepreneurship, provides a 'post-hoc reasoning'. This is mainly because of the fact that when people do not intend to act entrepreneurially, the reasoning against entrepreneurship through fear of failure happens after they have decided previously not to be entrepreneurs. In spite of the asymmetry, 'High Status to Successful Entrepreneurs' rate and 'Fear of failure' rate seem to be appropriate proxies of 'reasons for' and 'reasons against' entrepreneurship because of their coherence with the main social mechanisms through which culture affects entrepreneurship at an aggregate level (Bogatyreva, Edelman, Manolova, Osiyevskyy, &amp; Shirokova, 2019;Lortie, Barreto, &amp; Cox, 2019). As stated earlier, the psychological traits approach claims that pro-entrepreneurial values provide people with personality traits suitable for entrepreneurial activities (Thurik &amp; Dejardin, 2011). In this kind of culture, dissatisfaction can be another important driver of entrepreneurship for all people who don't feel satisfied by their career (Noorderhaven, Thurik, Wennekers, &amp; van Stel, 2004). Through primary and secondary socialization (2001( , Hofstede, 1991)), people learn that entrepreneurs receive social legitimation, and the desire of a high status is a strong push toward entrepreneurial activities (Davidsson, 1995). The effect of socialization is amplified by institutions, which develop rules that reward or discourage behaviours (Hofstede, 1991(Hofstede, ,2001)), and in a country where culture is characterized by values which discourage entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial intention will be limited by the lack of moral approval and people will pay more attention to the effects of their potential failures, so that fear becomes a strong barrier to the development of entrepreneurial activities, even when dissatisfaction exists.</p>
        <p>Since this study aims at investigation of the effects of cultural values (independent variables) on entrepreneurial cognitions (dependent variables), we have performed multiple regression analyses to test the previously-mentioned hypotheses, and we have used 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> software package version 
            <rs type="version">3.5.0</rs>. 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> is a widely used programming package for statistical analyses. It was basically introduced by Ihaka and Gentleman (1996); however many other statisticians and scholars are continuously contributing to the development of this open-source language of future statistical analyses.
        </p>
        <p>According to the probable collinearity in the GLOBE variables (Smith, 2006;Stephan &amp; Uhlaner, 2010), variance inflation factors (VIF) of the GLOBE scores are calculated. Collinearity is the harmful phenomenon in regression analyses in which some independent variables are predicted by other independent variables. Higher magnitudes of VIF indicate higher possibilities of collinearity. The cut-off threshold for the VIF is 5 (Sheather, 2009).</p>
        <p>The list of countries present in each of GEM and GLOBE are not completely the same. Thus, the overlap of the two datasets, consisting of 50 countries around the globe and 341 observations (from 2007 to 2017), are taken into account for the study. This sample passes the criteria, proposed by Franke and Richey (2010), of using at least seven to ten countries in culture-business studies to avoid biases (Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1971), and provides safe margins for generalization.</p>
        <p>When combining GLOBE and GEM an issue arises. GEM data are gathered every year, and GLOBE project data had been gathered in cross-sectional way. In spite of this 'time' issue, the difference of the datasets helps us to control the role of time and to understand whether the proposed relationships are robust over time. Time is then added to the model, and by checking the effect of time on R 2 , we test its effect on the variables of the study. To measure the effect size of the control variable, this formula is employed (Hair, Hult, Ringle, &amp; Sarstedt, 2014, p. 177):</p>
        <p>R 2 included and R 2 excluded are respectively the R 2 of the endogenous variables when a control exogenous variable is included and excluded. Cohen (1988) states that values of 0.02, 0.15, and 0.35 for f 2 are respectively considered low, medium, and high. Small effect sizes indicate an unimportant relationship, regardless of its statistical significance (Franke &amp; Richey, 2010). This kind of analysis is important to evaluate the magnitude of relationships (Brock, 2003), and to understand (Shaver, 2006).</p>
        <p>Table 1 indicates the descriptive statistics as well as the correlations among variables of the research framework. Four separate multiple linear regression models were performed using the R language coding process.</p>
        <p>In each of the four models, different endogenous variables are considered as the dependent variable of the regression. Then, for each regression, the effects of time on the dependent variables have been controlled so that the effect size of time could be calculated. Results of the regressions are summarized in Table 2.</p>
        <p>We have calculated the variance inflation factors of the GLOBE values as the predictor variables in R using lm() function. In nine OLS regression models, each GLOBE dimension was tested as a function of other dimensions. This is done so that collinearity among GLOBE values could be tested. Results of the VIF tests showed acceptable range of lower than 5.</p>
        <p>According to the results of multiple linear regressions, only two cultural values show significant impacts on both 'reason for' and 'reason against' EI at the same time: 'performance orientation' and 'gender egalitarianism'. The relationship between PO and 'reason for' is positive (t-value = 5.60), while the relationship between GE and 'reason for' is negative (t-value = -4.02). The relationships of PO and GE with 'reason against' narrate the same story; i.e., the relationship between PO and 'reason against' is negative (t-value = -4.22), while the relationship between GE and 'reason against' is positive (t-value = 3.91).</p>
        <p>The other dimensions affect either 'reason for' or 'reason against' EI, and only Col I has no effect. FO, ASS, and Col II show significant effects on 'reason for': all have a negative impact on it. In addition, the FO, Col II, and ASS do not significantly impact on the 'reason against'. UA, PD, and HO significantly influence only the 'reason against', and have a positive impact on it. Col I influences neither 'reason for' nor 'reason against'.</p>
        <p>As assumed by BRT, the 'reason for' has a positive impact on EI, while the 'reason against' has a negative impact, and both are significant. Finally, EI predicts the total entrepreneurial activities of a country significantly.</p>
        <p>In sum, the results indicate that some cultural values affect high status to successful entrepreneurs, as proxy of reason for entrepreneurship. While PO positively influences the reason for entrepreneurship, the effects of FO, Col II, GE, and ASS on reason for entrepreneurship are negative. Other cultural values do not exhibit any significant relationship with reason for entrepreneurship, including UA, PD, Col I, and HO. Thus, H 1a is partially approved, meaning that some cultural values influence the reasoning for entrepreneurship. As hypothesized, the proxy of reason for increases EI and hence H 1b is confirmed.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, some cultural values significantly affect reason against entrepreneurship, presented by fear of failure rate. These cultural values are: UA, PD, HO, PO, and GE, all of which exhibited a positive role except for PO. As a conclusion, H 2a is also partially confirmed. Moreover, reason against entrepreneurship negatively influences entrepreneurial intention as hypothesized and H 2b is confirmed, too. The effect of EI on TEA is proved significant in line with social psychology theories and thus, H 3 is also proved.</p>
        <p>In each of the regression models, time was introduced to test whether the variables significantly change over time. Table 2 shows the post-hoc models in which time influences 'reason against' and EI positively, while its relationships with 'reason for' and TEA is not significant. In other words, as time passes 'fear of failure' as well as EI increase for all the countries under investigation. The results of f 2 indicate that the effect size of time on the regression Models 1 and 4 are negligible (f 2 (reason for) = 0.003 and f 2 (TEA) = 0.000); therefore, time does not affect these two variables' explanations in the corresponding models.</p>
        <p>In addition, according to Cohen (1988), the levels of f 2 (reason against) = 0.025 and f 2 (intention) = 0.077 can be considered low, and we can conclude that the models are robust over time.</p>
        <p>Our findings show that, with the exception of Institutional Collectivism (Col I), all the dimensions affect both 'reason for' and 'reason against' entrepreneurship. This finding confirms previous research about the effects of cultural values on the development of entrepreneurial behaviour in a society (Davidsson, 1995;Thurik &amp; Dejardin, 2011). The regression analysis indicates that 'reason for' and 'reason against' entrepreneurship have a positive and negative effect on EI, respectively, and this confirms the application of the BRT in entrepreneurship.</p>
        <p>For discussions of the results in details, we have to go through the effects of cultural values on reasons and also the effects of reasons on EI. Performance orientation and gender egalitarianism have the strongest effects on the reasoning process because they impact both on the 'reason for' and the 'reason against' entrepreneurship. PO impacts positively on the 'reason for' and negatively on the 'reason against', and both effects are significant. Thus, PO increases 'reason for' and decreases 'reason against' that will collectively increase EI. On the contrary, GE impacts negatively on the 'reason for' and positively on the 'reason against', and again both effects are significant. And therefore, GE decreases EI through the negative impact on 'reason for' and positive impact on 'reason against'. PO is a trigger of entrepreneurship through the reasoning processes, while GE works as a barrier. By elaborating about the two mentioned dimensions, some important implications arise that are discussed below.</p>
        <p>PO forces individuals to look for high status and to compete for success. The desire to emerge is an important push towards personal initiative and risk-taking. A country which aims at improving entrepreneurship should value these behaviors and educate people to consider failures as opportunities for learning more than as negative outcomes of their activities. This is not easy in cultures which do not feel comfortable with risks and failures, but incentives, as well as the educational policies, can play an important role in improving performance orientation. Goal and success orientation are also typical of what Hofstede (1980) names masculine society, and this finding is coherent with all the contributions highlighting a positive impact of masculinity on entrepreneurship (McGrath, MacMillan, Scheinberg et al., 1992;Mueller, 2004;Hofstede et al., 2004). It is also coherent with the results reached by Stephan and Uhlaner (2010) on the positive effects of performance orientation on entrepreneurship.</p>
        <p>Our results show that GE impacts negatively on entrepreneurial intention through reasoning processes. In a country where GE is high, the 'reason for' entrepreneurial intention (high status to successful entrepreneurs) is low, while the 'reason against' entrepreneurial intention (fear of failure) is high. Countries with a high level of GE care about equality and equal opportunities, and this probably reduces the importance of prestige and success. Also, the literature associates GE with readiness to take care of others, inclination to harmony, valuing quality of life, and showing concerns for the future generations (Canestrino, Ćwiklicki, Magliocca, &amp; Pawełek, 2020;Katz, Swanson, &amp; Nelson, 2001;Peng, Dashdeleg, &amp; Chih, 2012;Power, Klassen, Kull, &amp; Simpson, 2015). In other words, societies that score higher in GE might not encourage individuals' success which costs dissonance and while it may jeopardize the regular income and consequently the quality of life. In such countries, people focus more on rights than on results, and this can discourage personal initiative and risk-taking. This is coherent with Zhao et al. (2012) findings about the relationship between low GE and entrepreneurship.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Cheraghi, Wickstrøm and Klyver (2019) pointed out that it is not easy to assume more women enter into entrepreneurial career in pro GE societies. In such societies, institutions provide paid maternity leaves, care about work-family balance, and subsidise childcare. This raises the women's opportunity costs to launch their own businesses and hence the correlation between GE and female entrepreneurship is negative (Klyver, Nielsen, &amp; Evald, 2013;Thébaud, 2015).</p>
        <p>In addition, House et al. (2004) associate GE with femininity -the opposite of the masculinity dimension. This reinforces the coherence between our results and the previous contributions on the positive effects of masculinity on entrepreneurship (such as : Mueller, 2004;McGrath, MacMillan, Scheinberg et al., 1992;Hofstede et al., 2004). The output of our analysis reinforces the idea of a connection between PO and masculinity on one side, and between GE and femininity on the other, and suggests that the values associated with masculinity are the ones which affect EI the most.</p>
        <p>Other cultural dimensions impact either on the 'reason for' or on the 'reason against' entrepreneurship. Future orientation, assertiveness, and in-group collectivism have a significant negative impact on the 'reason for', while uncertainty avoidance, power distance, and humane orientation have a significant positive impact on the 'reason against' entrepreneurship. In other words, FO, ASS, and Col II decrease 'reason for' and consequently EI. Also, UA, PD, and HO increase 'reason against' and eventually decrease EI.</p>
        <p>The negative effect of ASS has been found by other scholars in the same field (Rauch et al., 2013;Stephan &amp; Uhlaner, 2010). ASS reduces the value of 'high status to successful entrepreneurs' at country level. This is in line with those of Stephan and Uhlaner (2010), who found that performance-based culture (PBC), highly affected by FO, does not affect either entrepreneurial rate or desirability. They also found that ASS is highly associated with socially supportive culture (SSC), which increases entrepreneurial rates, although it has no impact on beliefs of entrepreneurial self-efficacy.</p>
        <p>It is very critical to note, instead, that FO behaves unconventionally in our results that surprise the audience. While researchers might assume that FO would have a positive impact on 'reason for', it turns out to have a negative effect on it. FO is an indicator of the value of futureoriented behaviors such as planning and delaying gratification for better results in future. The negative effects of FO and ASS seem to suggest that long-range planning and inclination to compete and dominate do not push people to become entrepreneurs, and suggests that the capability to see opportunities, as well as the desire to succeed, are much more important values of entrepreneurs.</p>
        <p>With regard to in-group collectivism, we found that it can inhibit EI through its negative impact on 'reason for'. This is in contrast to previous results of other scholars who applied the GLOBE dimensions (Rauch et al., 2013;Zhao et al., 2012;Alon et al., 2016). However, if we look at the wider cross-cultural literature, we find contrasting results about the effects of collectivism, and our focus on reasoning could be helpful to explain these contrasting results. When collectivism is high, harmony is much more important than individual success, and people do their best to satisfy the group. Collective actions are valued more than individual ones, and this reduces the value of 'high status to successful entrepreneurs', which on the other hand increases EI. This result suggests that policies aimed at encouraging entrepreneurship should be aware of this negative impact of in-group collectivism on EI through 'reason for' entrepreneurship.</p>
        <p>Uncertainty avoidance, power distance, and humane orientation do not affect the 'reason for', but have a significant positive impact on the 'reason against' entrepreneurship. Uncertainty avoidance creates risk aversion and reduces EI through its positive impact on 'reason against' entrepreneurship. This finding is in line with the previous literature in the field, and easily understandable if we consider that entrepreneurial activities are risky, and policies aimed at supporting entrepreneurship in uncertainty avoidance countries should create social mechanisms through which the effects of risks are reduced. Networking and support services could be of help in this regard.</p>
        <p>We found a negative effect of power distance, which is in contrast with other studies in the field. The negative effect of PD on EI, through its positive impact on 'reason against', could be due to the importance people give to their position. Failures would reduce their prestige, and this is of low desirability in power distant societies. Information control and the lack of social mobility seem to reduce individuals' inclination to act and to start a business, although the negative effect of PD on the 'reason for' entrepreneurship intention is not statistically significant.</p>
        <p>Finally, our results suggest that ffects of cultural values on entrepreneurship had focused on the rates of entrepreneurship at the country level. Our study posits that the question "Which aspect of entrepreneurship cognition is affected by cultural values?" is as important as the question "How do cultural values affect entrepreneurship?". The focus on reasoning (as an aspect of entrepreneurship cognition) helps to understand the complex relationship between culture and entrepreneurship at a country level through the lens of 'reasoning processes'.</p>
        <p>Future orientation (FO), in-group collectivism (Col II), and assertiveness (ASS) have significant negative effects on the 'reason for' EI, while uncertainty avoidance (UA), power distance (PD), and humane orientation (HO) have a significant positive impact on the 'reason against' EI. Only performance orientation (PO) and gender egalitarianism (GE) have a significant impact both on the 'reasons for' (+, -) and 'reasons against' (-, +), with a clear positive effect of the former and a clear negative effect of the latter on EI, and consequently on entrepreneurial activity at a country level. Finally, institutional collectivism (Col I) has no significant effect on neither the 'reason for' nor the 'reason against' EI; but given that in our analysis we tested linear relationships, we cannot exclude its probable impacts in a non-linear way.</p>
        <p>From the theoretical points of view, these results are important because they suggest a new way to approach cross-cultural entrepreneurship, and to understand more about the effects of cultural values on the phenomenon of entrepreneurship. Considering the reasoning behind intention, we can clarify the ambiguous effects of some cultural values, and overcome the contradictions existing among some previous findings of other scholars. At a practical level, they can be useful to promote policies which leverage some values, and to organize activities and programs which fit with the prevailing values, in order to have a positive effect on the reasoning behind entrepreneurial intention, and consequently on the level of entrepreneurial activities across countries.</p>
        <p>Despite its novelty and originality, there are some limitations, too. Our study is mainly focused on the 'reason for' and the 'reason against' EI, and consequent activities, but it does not consider global motivesattitudes, norms, and perceived control, which are conceptually affected by reasons and simultaneously impact intentions. It is highly recommended that future studies focus on the simultaneous effects of all the aforementioned variables, to empirically test whether reasons behave differently from motives in the field of entrepreneurship.</p>
        <p>It is important to note that we limited our analysis to linear relationships among cultural values and reasons. However, an investigation of nonlinear correlations among different cultural values of GLOBE (Hofstede, 2006;Javidan et al., 2006) would shed more light on the complexity of cultural values and on their effects on the reasoning behind entrepreneurial intention.</p>
        <p>Another limitation of the present study is based on the GEM dataset, which offers just one variable corresponding to 'reason for' and one to 'reason against' entrepreneurial intention. Considering just one value as a proxy for a complex reasoning creates the risk of a limited analysis and understanding. According to the theory of needs, the 'reason for' entrepreneurial intention is taken as equivalent to 'high status to successful entrepreneurs', but this image of the 'reason for' entrepreneurial intention is incomplete. The same limitation is at play for the 'reason against' EI, which takes as equivalent the 'fear of failure'. Also, the asymmetry, mentioned in the methodology section, between the two measurements brings about another limitation for this study. While conceptually linked to the mechanisms through which culture affects intention and action, 'High Status to Successful Entrepreneurs' rate and 'Fear of failure' rate are asymmetric and refer to different timing of the cognitive processes. Further research should be aimed at finding different measures of 'reason for' and 'reason against' entrepreneurship, and test again their relationships with cultural values and entrepreneurial intention.</p>
        <p>Secondary data from GLOBE and GEM cause another limitation in our study. Some social scientists observe that secondary data based on the opinions of individuals are distorted and therefore not trustworthy. The inspirational book by Stephens-Davidowitz (2017), a data scientist at Google, provides new knowledge about how data might deceive researchers. Although much research in the field of culture and entrepreneurship rely on GLOBE and GEM, it is highly recommended that we move forward to the great data era of social networks and search engines to provide a better picture of the issue to overcome this limitation.</p>
        <p>Since its development, BRT has received attention by many scholars in different fields of research (Claudy et al., 2015;Gupta &amp; Arora, 2017;Paul et al., 2016;Ryan &amp; Casidy, 2018;Westaby et al., 2010). With the exception of Miralles et al., work of 2017, there is a lack of application of this interesting cognitive theory in the field of entrepreneurship.</p>
        <p>Our analysis suggests that the application of the BRT can provide deeper insight about the relationship between values and entrepreneurship, confirming the importance of considering the cognitive process behind the development of intention and its translation into activities, and confirming also some results existing in the literature, such as the effects of PO and GE. It offers new insight into the controversial effects of other cultural values, whose impacts become clear if we look at reasons, and not directly at activities.</p>
        <p>Our results confirm that the consideration of social psychology theories of intention and behavior can be a source for theoretical development of entrepreneurial cognition research across cultures. The application of these theories can contribute to the understanding of the complex relationship between culture and entrepreneurship, helping to understand how cultural values impact on the reasoning behind entrepreneurial intention and entrepreneurial activity, as well as which cultural values really affect entrepreneurship.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, this study was an endeavour to scrutinize the cognitions of entrepreneurial intention and behaviour through a novel theoretical framework (BRT). Doing so helped us to analyse the effects of all the nine cultural values of the GLOBE model on the reason for as well as reason against entrepreneurship at country level. Moreover, this study contributes substantially to the debate about culture and entrepreneurship by analysing controversial relationships among values and reasons that have not been studied in the literature. Some surprising findings that were discussed in the previous section can contribute to the creation of consensus in our collective body of understanding about how culture affects entrepreneurial cognitions by looking at various aspects of BRT in the field of entrepreneurship including reasons for and against entrepreneurship.</p>
