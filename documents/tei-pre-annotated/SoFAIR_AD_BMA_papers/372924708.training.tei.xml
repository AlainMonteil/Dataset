        <p>The integration of products and services into a bundled product/service offering by manufacturing organisations is seen as a global trend in today's competitive business environment. The shift of product-based manufacturers towards offering business solutions and value-added services to consumers is termed as 'Servitization'. Contrary to the potential benefits expected by adding service activities to the offerings, advocates voice their concerns towards experiential problems and challenges in employing the servitization strategy -termed as 'Servitization Paradox'. Nevertheless, the shift from product-based delivery to a service-based provision has the potential to significantly impact on developing sustainable and eco-friendly environment. To provide greater insights to the servitization phenomenon, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the servitization implementation in manufacturing organisations. In order to respond to the latter, we propose the following three research questions "Q1what are the different types of servitization strategies", "Q2what are the different servitization definitions", "Q3what are the potential benefits in selecting a servitization strategy?", "Q4what are the challenges in transitioning towards servitization?". A systematic literature review is carried out to understand the past trends and extant patterns/themes in the servitization strategy research area, evaluate contributions, summarise knowledge, thereby identifying limitations, implications and potential further research avenues. The key findings confirm servitization studies have contributed both conceptually and empirically to the development and accumulation of intellectual wealth to the manufacturing operations and supply chain discipline. Moreover, the findings clearly indicate the potential of servitization in transitioning manufacturing organisations (e.g. benefits) and utilising innovative technologies to generate business value. Nevertheless, some voices are backing further research/development in the area of servitization due to the several existing challenges.The integration of products and services into a bundled product/service offering by manufacturing organisations is seen as a global trend in today's competitive business environment.

        <p>In realising the global transformations in digitising businesses, the industry emphasizing in smart initiatives, in automation and robotisation and the competitive business environment, manufacturing organisations are shifting from traditional product-based business models towards developing and implementing service-oriented business models (Baines et al., 2009a;Baines et al., 2010;Lightfoot et al., 2013;Ferreira et al., 2016;Martin et al., 2018). For instance, several leading multinational titans, such as GE, IBM, Rolls Royce, Fujitsu, and Siemens remained competitive through the basis of value delivered by shifting their market share from manufacturing to more product-service-oriented systems.In realising the global transformations in digitising businesses, the industry emphasizing in smart initiatives, in automation and robotisation and the competitive business environment, manufacturing organisations are shifting from traditional product-based business models towards developing and implementing service-oriented business models (Baines et al., 2009a;Baines et al., 2010;Lightfoot et al., 2013;Ferreira et al., 2016;Martin et al., 2018).

        <p>Over the years, providing services embedded within products' offerings has gradually become a fundamental business constituent for the manufacturing sector (Parida et al., 2014;Bigdeli et al., 2017;Vaittinen et al., 2018). Advocates support that traditional manufacturers can acquire more revenue from their service provisions (as a promising approach) compared to product-based offerings, with added value primarily secured from the service units (Wise and Baumgartner, 1999). This gradual shift towards offering value-added services (i.e. "going downstream") is influenced by several change factors e.g. changing consumer demands and behaviour, information sharing and management, globalisation of the manufacturing sector, sustainable competitive advantage, market saturation, triadic nature of service supply chains, and diffusion of innovation products and services (Dimache and Roche, 2013;Opresnik and Taisch, 2015;Aminoff and Hakanen, 2018).Over the years, providing services embedded within products' offerings has gradually become a fundamental business constituent for the manufacturing sector (Parida et al., 2014;Bigdeli et al., 2017;Vaittinen et al., 2018).

        <p>The transformation towards services-led business model is collectively referred to as "Servitization", which was initially discussed by Theodore Levitt (e.g. Levitt, 1976), but later captured by Vandermerwe and Rada (1988) and has led to a developing stream of research, including influential works by the likes of Wise and Baumgartner (1999). In essence, servitization, as a process of value-creation through bundling service provision with manufacturing products, has been broadly recognised as a competitive manufacturing strategy. As a research domain, it has been developed considerably in recent years, pushing manufacturing organisations to change their perspective from merely delivering products to creating value added services (Lightfoot et al., 2013).The transformation towards services-led business model is collectively referred to as "Servitization", which was initially discussed by Theodore Levitt (e.g. Levitt, 1976), but later captured by Vandermerwe and Rada (1988) and has led to a developing stream of research, including influential works by the likes of Wise and Baumgartner (1999).

        <p>Contrary to the potential benefits expected by adding service activities to the product offerings, contenders voice their concerns towards experiential problems and challenges in employing the servitization strategy 1 (Gebauer et al., 2005). Large investments in developing the manufacturing service business may lead to increasing service offerings and greater costs; nevertheless, it may also not always produce the anticipated higher returns (Guo et al., 2015). Neely (2008) further suggests that, even if they increase their income returns, servitized manufacturing organisations often make reduced profits compared to non-servitized manufacturing organisations who do not extend their activities into servicestraditional product-centric. Matschewsky et al., (2017) and Lim et al., (2018) also identified challenges that manufacturing organisations encounter while implementing servitization e.g. related to strategic alignment and to ensuring customer trust. Despite the significance of the servitization phenomenon, these theorised conceptions clearly question the extent to which manufacturing organisations are able to effectively and efficiently master the transition from product manufacturing to 1 By strategy(ies) we mean "a plan of action(s) designed to achieve a long term-term goal of a business.

        <p>To provide detailed insights to the phenomenon of servitization and establish a fundamental cognitive reference point, the authors respond through a comprehensive Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of the servitization research literature. To analyse and synthesize the extant literature on servitization strategy research area, we followed the SLR approach proposed by Tranfield et al., (2003). The scope and applicability of servitization phenomenon clearly indicates that this area has the potential to support the manufacturing organisations to transition effectively into services (Baines et al., 2009b;Dimache and Roche 2013). This SLR compliments existing literature through an enhanced descriptive and thematic awareness of the resulting body of knowledge, structuring the servitization research area so as to further develop in a more cognizant and multidisciplinary approach. This type of profiling research is essential in order to establish an understanding of the servitization area and the growth in the theory and application of servitization strategy within the manufacturing organisations. This paper is predominantly descriptive and inductive in nature; the interest is on understanding the concepts of servitization and its distinctiveness as practiced by manufacturing organisations. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a normative perspective on the servitization area.To provide detailed insights to the phenomenon of servitization and establish a fundamental cognitive reference point, the authors respond through a comprehensive Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of the servitization research literature.

        <p>Manufacturing organisations have been selling services for some time (Baines et al., 2010). There has been a dramatic change in the way services are produced and marketed by manufacturing organisations leading to different forms of servitization strategies (Finne et al., 2013). Ahamed et al., (2013) highlights that the rationale for developing service operations, extending the services business and integrating products and services can be classed into viewpoints that drive companies to pursue a servitization strategy; such as, strategic, financial, economic, marketing and environments. There are various other categorisations of servitization (or product-service systems) types.

        <p>Regardless of any servitization strategy adopted, a common theme in this service provision is the drive for demonstrating how the inclusion of intangible services can supplement the sale or lease of tangible products, and their significance for the development and competitive success of manufacturing organisations. Through this SLR exercise, we recognised the significance of the product-service based servitization strategy and the way in which this strategy supports traditional manufacturing in transitioning to service-based manufacturing. Almost all the papers reviewed in this SLR exercise clearly highlight the reasons manufacturing organisations aspire to include more services in the offerings e.g. expedite their products sales, prolong relationships with existing customers and expand on market share, support in developing more growth opportunities in global markets and respond to demands from different stakeholders. From the SLR analysis, it is also evident that services and manufacturing organisations may have several distinct differences that derive from the consumable, intricate and multifunctional character and type of services and service operations. With the scale of the types of manufacturing operations (e.g. production, design and development, distribution), it can be alleged that production and delivery system of products are two separate operations in the manufacturing organisations, nevertheless, they are inseparable in services.Regardless of any servitization strategy adopted, a common theme in this service provision is the drive for demonstrating how the inclusion of intangible services can supplement the sale or lease of tangible products, and their significance for the development and competitive success of manufacturing organisations.

        <p>There is no uniform definition of the term servitization (Baines et al., 2009b). Nevertheless, what servitization may bring to manufacturing organisations appears to be substantial as evidenced from the viewpoints presented in servitization literature. For example, it can set entry barriers for potential competitors, and similarly, can offer distinguished market offerings and new innovations. Having reviewed the literature, both the findings from the earlier (i.e. Vandermerwe and Rada, 1988) and also the findings from the contemporary (e.g. including among others Slack et al., 2004;Johnson and Mena, 2008;Pawar et al., 2009;Baines et al., 2009a;2009b) with particular consideration to the sections of the articles that made explicit references to servitization, a series of contributions extracted from these references were reviewed. Our research addresses Q2 by providing in Table 2 (please refer to the Appendix) a classification of servitization definitions2 including presenting the core theme arising from each definition/description. All these definitions/descriptions emphasize the strategic significance of servitization for a traditional manufacturer. Within these definitions/descriptions of servitization, the essential focus is transitioning from product only manufacturing to product and service manufacturing. The essence of servitization is on adding value to customers (i.e. demand pull) and to solve traditional manufacturing problems, nevertheless, the degree of innovative nature of making use of technology is still largely missing i.e. service innovation (Roos, 2015). In today's global competitive business environment and omni-channel supply chain landscape, the use of advanced innovative technologies has necessitated a paradigm shift to provide integrated service provision i.e. integrated solutions traversing from manufacturing the product through last mile delivery to customer, entrenched with services (Goduscheit and Faullant, 2018). In developing a sustainable end-to-end integrated product-service system that delivers customised products with embedded services, the synergy between servitization and innovative technologies (e.g. industry 4.0, big data analytics, digital manufacturing, artificial intelligence) has the required capability to optimise internal manufacturing processes and achieving optimal decision-making (Cavalcante et al., 2019). The latter is also referred to as the foundation of the digital transformation, which in essence is more about developing digital solutions to facilitate inherently new forms of modernisation, integration (both horizontal and vertical) and creativeness, rather than merely augmenting and supporting conventional approaches.There is no uniform definition of the term servitization (Baines et al., 2009b).

        <p>Thus, based on our in-depth review and understanding of the servitization area, we define that "Servitization is the strategic shift of an organisation's capabilities, human and financial resources and processes in order to offer end-to-end integrated services utilising innovative technologies that deliver added value to products".Thus, based on our in-depth review and understanding of the servitization area, we define that "Servitization is the strategic shift of an organisation's capabilities, human and financial resources and processes in order to offer end-to-end integrated services utilising innovative technologies that deliver added value to products".</p>
        <p>In line with the above proposed servitization definition, Xiong et al., (2012) assert that innovation of service with core product offerings is vital to the servitization strategy.

        <p>There is a growing understanding and acceptance of the benefits of servitization among manufacturers. The benefits of servitization are many and varied and have been widely discussed in the extant literature. As highlighted by Baines and Shi (2015), some of the benefits of servitization are not universally agreed in the extant literature. For instance, some researchers suggest significant improvements have been made in terms of increased profit margins whereas others argue that, despite significant investment, returns do not match managers' expectations (Gebauer and Fleisch, 2007).There is a growing understanding and acceptance of the benefits of servitization among manufacturers.

        <p>Nevertheless, manufacturers have several reasons to include more services in their total offering as by using the servitization approach to get closer to customers, drive up customer loyalty levels, develop more valuable supplier-customer relationships and ultimately generate recurring and incremental revenue streams (Brax, 2005). Advocates e.g. Gebauer and Friedli (2005); Opresnik and Taisch (2015) and Neuhüttler et al., (2018) report that service addition can help an organisation differentiate itself from its competitors and support the consolidation and protection of the core product business and allow for better customer relationship. As services are more labour dependent and provide less visible rendering, it makes it more difficult to imitate, and therefore leads to sustainable competitive advantage for organisations (Guo et al., 2015).Nevertheless, manufacturers have several reasons to include more services in their total offering as by using the servitization approach to get closer to customers, drive up customer loyalty levels, develop more valuable supplier-customer relationships and ultimately generate recurring and incremental revenue streams (Brax, 2005).

As services are more labour dependent and provide less visible rendering, it makes it more difficult to imitate, and therefore leads to sustainable competitive advantage for organisations (Guo et al., 2015).</p>
        <p>In order to successfully address 'Q3', we reviewed all 204 articles in detail to extract relevant data on the benefits acquired from transitioning towards servitized manufacturing. To do so, we focused on conceptual as well on empirical based research studies conducted in different manufacturing organisations e.g. semi-conductors; organisations that design and manufacture high value capital equipment for the power; defence and aerospace markets; heating, ventilation air conditioning (HVAC), automotive, personal computers, etc. The empirical findings in the form of a classification of servitization benefits are illustrated in Figure 5. On analysing the benefits, it is evident that where other benefits are vital and clarify the significance of servitization -one of the most cited benefits is "a sustainable source of competitive advantage".In order to successfully address 'Q3', we reviewed all 204 articles in detail to extract relevant data on the benefits acquired from transitioning towards servitized manufacturing.

        <p>Competitive advantages acquired through supplementary service provision are often more sustainable since, being less visible and more labour dependent, services are more challenging to replicate (Gebauer et al., 2005). According to Ren and Gregory (2007), "manufacturing servitization" or "servitization within manufacturing" as a process i.e. choose a service-oriented strategy and develop better services to meet customer needs, supports achieving competitive advantages and improving manufacturing performance. Thus, supplementary service provision is a key construct influencing customer satisfaction and vital source for improving competitiveness (Norman, 1984). servitized systems arguably results in several benefits but also involves significant challenges.Competitive advantages acquired through supplementary service provision are often more sustainable since, being less visible and more labour dependent, services are more challenging to replicate (Gebauer et al., 2005).

        <p>For instance, Coreynen et al., (2017) reports that the reasoning behind many manufacturing organisations that are still averse in using supplementary service provision for growth purposes is that servitization is still considered 'a black box'. Similar, Klein et al., (2018) report that poor service culture and lack of support from decision-makers are among the central challenges when moving to a service-centric approach. Baines et al., (2009), being main advocates of servitization, confer that the adoption of servitization by a conventional manufacturer principally presents challenges for the service design, the organisational strategy and the organisational transformation. Implementing servitization requires fundamental top to bottom changes, for example aligning servitization strategy with corporate culture, marketing, production, and high investment resources, thus making it highly challenging for organisations to shift to a servitization business model (e.g. Baines et al., 2008;Brax, 2005;Peillon et al., 2018). In line with the latter argument, Martinez et al., (2010) also argue that relationship-based value creation increases the human resources needed (i.e. number of staff members) to interact with the customer and meeting their demands, which is often not an easy task for organisations.For instance, Coreynen et al., (2017) reports that the reasoning behind many manufacturing organisations that are still averse in using supplementary service provision for growth purposes is that servitization is still considered 'a black box'.

        <p>To address Q4, we reviewed all 204 papers in detail to extract relevant data on the types of challenges faced by manufacturing organisations in transitioning to servitization. The empirical findings in the form of a classification of servitization challenges is illustrated in Figure 6. On analysing the challenges in transition towards servitization, issues that are commonly referred to in the extant literature include challenges such as failure in deploying successful service strategy (e.g. Olivia et al., 2003), lack of strategic relationships with suppliers/customers (e.g. Martinez et al., 2010) and slow and cautious transition towards servitization (e.g. Alix and Zacharewicz, 2012). It is certain that servitization within manufacturing is evidently a diverse and complex field with contributions arising across a range of research communities that are interdependent. Improved awareness and cohesion across these communities will help to improve the quality and rate of knowledge production, and establish important future research challenges. Increasing awareness of these challenges linked to servitization in research and the modest application of servitized business models in industrial practice indicate that a critical examination of the servitization phenomenon is necessary (Lay, 2014).To address Q4, we reviewed all 204 papers in detail to extract relevant data on the types of challenges faced by manufacturing organisations in transitioning to servitization.

        <p>To achieve the desired servitization outcomes, manufacturing organisations need to evaluate the stream of challenges in line with their performance objectives and the challenges addressed, both in the shortterm as well as in the long-term. More importantly, manufacturing organisations should align their servitization strategy with their organisational culture (Peillon et al., 2018) and enhancing ability and enabling space for service innovation (Lindhult et al., 2018).To achieve the desired servitization outcomes, manufacturing organisations need to evaluate the stream of challenges in line with their performance objectives and the challenges addressed, both in the shortterm as well as in the long-term.

        <p>In this section, we summarise the theoretical contributions of this study, paying specific attention to its relevance for practitioners. Finally, we discuss the limits of our work and offer recommendations for future research. Since its inception in 1988, scholars from operations management, supply chain management, and service operations disciplines have studied servitization and applied in different context, though mainly in manufacturing. It is predominantly regarded as a means for an integrated delivery of both products and services along a seamless flow of information, enhancing the knowledge sharing between and among the manufacturing supply chain partners and providing a win-win basis for both organisations and customers (Guo et al., 2015). This paper presents the past and current state of servitization research published in a number of key operations and production management journals and conferences. Following Tranfield's et al., (2003) 'Systematic Review Approach', the authors extracted and reviewed 204 journal and conference articles from 1988 to 2018. Figures 1 to 6 and Tables 1 to 2 clearly indicate the past trends and current patterns in the papers published on servitization. Moreover, the continuing interest and the use of servitization strategies specifies that in future research studies academics, researchers and practitioners may focus on the factors driving or inhibiting implementing servitization to further propose robust solutions to the service related problems. The intention in conducting this detailed investigation was to provide a useful, yet usable, source of information for future researchers.In this section, we summarise the theoretical contributions of this study, paying specific attention to its relevance for practitioners.

        <p>Over the past few decades, research in the manufacturing sector has gradually increased and shifted from product-only manufacturing sector to thorough service provision integrated with products (Coreynen et al., 2017). However, Lenka et al., (2018) argue that most of these servitization studies have primarily focused on the journey of servitizing organisations along a unidirectional, advanced productto-service continuum. Today there is a growing need for intangible (no more only tangible) goods and services (along a bi-directional continuum) such as specialised skills, knowledge and processesthe focal point of almost every leading manufacturing organisation. While valuable knowledge has been developed, recent studies have begun to highlight servitizing organisations' persistent inclination to focus on their product-oriented businesses in parallel with their rising service-oriented business (e.g. Kowalkowski et al., 2015). This paper provided a number of insights into the extant status of research into servitization phenomenon, how it is defined and conceptualised. In reviewing the articles, it was evident that the prime emphasis was on qualitative (case study based) research studies, followed by very limited studies using quantitative approach, including some articles focusing on design research, analytical, action and experimental research.Over the past few decades, research in the manufacturing sector has gradually increased and shifted from product-only manufacturing sector to thorough service provision integrated with products (Coreynen et al., 2017).

        <p>The authors assert that more practical insights into servitization can be attained by utilizing the findings of this SLR to enlighten and direct research towards a more comprehensive analysis of the servitization i.e. including the key conceptual as well as empirical developments (specifically also utilizing surveybased research). More detailed research is required to understand the existence of product and service business orientations. This is because product-based businesses focus on productivity and standardisation, which largely opposes the heterogeneity and flexibility required to run a service centric business. In this paper, we have not dwelt on identifying specific lines of enquiry on servitization, but rather focused on synthesising and presenting a comprehensive analysis of the systematic literature on servitization. This paper extends the research stream on servitization by demonstrating and analysing the key trends related to the servitization strategies, classifying servitization definitions, benefit and challenges and identifying the gaps that require further investigation.The authors assert that more practical insights into servitization can be attained by utilizing the findings of this SLR to enlighten and direct research towards a more comprehensive analysis of the servitization i.e. including the key conceptual as well as empirical developments (specifically also utilizing surveybased research).

        <p>While business models are regularly seen as planned strategies, servitization may occur incrementally in response to requests from customers (Kowalkowski et al., 2012;Raja et al., 2018). This SLR research highlights the importance of actively developing capabilities to ensure that they are aligned with the business model, which may evolve to match customer demand. More specifically, the challenges presented in Figure 6 clearly offer opportunities for researchers and practitioners to further the research on servitization from strategic (e.g. need for successful alignment between organisation and service strategy), organisational (e.g. focus on transforming organisational culture and developing simple business models to facilitate servitization implementation process), operational (e.g. provide relevant training to staff to enable smooth transition towards servitized manufacturing), financial (e.g. reducing the cost of service provision), technological (e.g. developing sophisticated designs of service offerings)While business models are regularly seen as planned strategies, servitization may occur incrementally in response to requests from customers (Kowalkowski et al., 2012;Raja et al., 2018).

An organisation's design capabilities should be clearly identified, because these define what types of products and services can be designed and, hence, whether customer demand can be met. As well as enabling offerings to customers, design capabilities may restrict the nature of services that can be offered. Therefore, managers must ensure that these capabilities are updated.and environmental (e.g. supporting the improved environmental performance) viewpoint.

Despite a considerable body of literature examining many aspects of servitization, there are still several areas that remain under-explored.Building upon the rich underpinning of the research findings described and overall understanding acquired in this paper, the authors presents the concerns that merit further research and anticipate that these gaps may hold the potential in contributing towards the future research studies.

        <p>• Firstly, the analysis of the selected articles reveals that the opportunity clearly exists, specifically to strengthen empirical research on predictive tools and quantitative approach. Most of the papers analysed follow an inductive qualitative case-study based approach. As Martinez et al., (2010, pp. 449) stated "given the nature of research design, the identified patterns cannot be used as a predictive tool". It would be crucial to conduct transversal studies with a quantitative approach, which is particularly important in the context of analysing servitization implementation effectswith specific focus on users (customers).• Firstly, the analysis of the selected articles reveals that the opportunity clearly exists, specifically to strengthen empirical research on predictive tools and quantitative approach.

        <p>• Secondly, as a result of product commoditisation and the ever-increasing competition among manufacturing organisations, managers sought to offer supplementary services to their customers to secure their competitive positioning in the market. Nevertheless, many organisations (mainly from emerging economies) are often not able to offer services embedded with products. To remain competitive, they link with service providers in a "service network" collaboration to provide services for their customers. Weigel and Hadwich (2018) argue that despite the significance of this area, research on managing these service networks in the context of servitization is still limited and needs further investigation and we would also add that the organisational development of such networks including the partnering premises should be further substantiated in terms of approaches, methods, impact and resilience.• Secondly, as a result of product commoditisation and the ever-increasing competition among manufacturing organisations, managers sought to offer supplementary services to their customers to secure their competitive positioning in the market.

        <p>• Thirdly, innovative technological developments in manufacturing (such as cloud manufacturing, industry 4.0 manufacturing linked with servitization or digital servitization) are challenging the traditional manufacturing business models, and adapting these is key to a sustainable competitive advantage. The potential of cloud manufacturing and servitization is a growing field of interest that still requires further research for developing new servitization based business models to capture value (Charro and Schaefer, 2018;Heinis et al., 2018). There is also a need to consider the use of automation and robotics, and artificial intelligence in playing a significant role in delivering services for manufactures. Baines et al., (2020) reiterate the latter argument that the influence of disruptive innovation and dynamics of technology shift on servitization is still underdeveloped.• Thirdly, innovative technological developments in manufacturing (such as cloud manufacturing, industry 4.0 manufacturing linked with servitization or digital servitization) are challenging the traditional manufacturing business models, and adapting these is key to a sustainable competitive advantage.

        <p>• Lastly, there is a growing need for additional focus and research on how servitization adopts and works with circular economy business models and avoid any fragmented research (Kühl et al., 2019). Businesses and organisations can shift from a linear servitization strategy to a more sustainable service-oriented business models that provides resource efficiency-related services for customers which will be the most resilient and profitable in the future. There is much more need for creating commercial opportunities that focuses on the economic construct (e.g. increased revenues, extended product lifecycles, economic recoverability) by bringing new and more resource efficient services to the market (Doni et al., 2019;Parida et at., 2014). In this context, a growing relevant topic comes from developing co-creation mechanisms that enable capabilities, reduce the adverse effects of servitization and improve the product development.• Lastly, there is a growing need for additional focus and research on how servitization adopts and works with circular economy business models and avoid any fragmented research (Kühl et al., 2019).

        <p>Overall, there is a need for stronger infusion of general strategy theory into the servitization debate.Overall, there is a need for stronger infusion of general strategy theory into the servitization debate.</p>
        <p>Servitization is a cross-cutting theme, and many linkages exist with established topics across engineering, management, technology and sustainability. Moving forward, we advocate in favour of the substantial need to understand the value of servitization for manufacturing companies in terms of resource consumption, impact on the competitiveness of the firm in order to evaluate the boundaries of flexibility and improve the corporate agility and resilience. Furthermore, based on our research we would propose to further study how new production concepts like Internet of Things (IoT), Circular Economy, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning enable servitization strategies. Especially considering the current fluid economic environment, the collaborative strategies should be further investigated in terms of best-fitness with the servitization strategies. Last but not least, we would also propose addressing the potential of servitization to other, less mainstream industries, for example processing, smart manufacturing and recycling. Many papers that our method selected discussed conceptual studies and the empirical elements have been rather limited. This asks for more work on this aspect with real cases and the development of new, empirically backed theories. Similarly, we propose an additional focus on the behavioural side of servitization and the implications to the current business models.Servitization is a cross-cutting theme, and many linkages exist with established topics across engineering, management, technology and sustainability.
