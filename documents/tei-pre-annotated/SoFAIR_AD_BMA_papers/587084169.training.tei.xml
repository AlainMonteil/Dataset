        <p>This paper delves into the multifaceted concept of sustainability, covering its evolution, laws, principles, as well as the different domains and challenges related to achieving it in the modern world. Although capitalism, socialism, and communism have been utilized throughout history, their strengths and drawbacks have failed to address sustainable development comprehensively. Therefore, a holistic approach is necessary, which forms the basis for a new development model called sustainalism. This study proposes a new socio-economic theory of sustainalism that prioritizes quality of life, social equity, culture, world peace, social justice, and well-being. This paper outlines the six principles of sustainalism and identifies sustainalists as individuals who embrace these new concepts. This study also explores how to attain sustainalism in the modern world through a sustainable revolution, representing a step toward a sustainable era. In conclusion, this paper summarizes the key points and emphasizes the need for a new approach to sustainalism in the broader sense. The insights provided are valuable for further research on sustainalism and sustainability.This paper delves into the multifaceted concept of sustainability, covering its evolution, laws, principles, as well as the different domains and challenges related to achieving it in the modern world.

        <p>Sustainability has been widely accepted since the olden days, especially in rural societies. The world's ancient cultures combine worship and religious convictions with environmental preservation, which calls on people to take care of the planet and keep it in good condition; this may be considered a demonstration of sustainability in the ancient ages. The "sustainability" term's origins can be found in the realm of hunting, wherein hunters and gatherers were eager to establish a stable means of subsistence. In old German, "sustenance" refers to provisions kept in reserve for emergencies. The verb "to sustain" or the phrase "sustainable" have both been "proven to be a derivation of the noun "sustenance" (literally retain, what one retains). Nowadays, the word "sustainable" still has the meaning of being "enduringly effective" in common usage [1].Sustainability has been widely accepted since the olden days, especially in rural societies.

        <p>Silent Spring by Racheal Carson, The Ecologist's A Blueprint for Survival, and The Population Bomb by Ehrlich are some early works that significantly impacted the world in the cradle stage of sustainable development during the 1960s. After that, within a short time, the words "sustainable" and "sustainability" were introduced in the Oxford English Dictionary [2]. The word "sustainable" comes from the Latin word "sustinere". Thomas Malthu's postulates on the drastic consumption of natural resources and energy emerged, addressing the aftermaths of the population explosion. In his essay, he stated the principle of population, showing that population growth is not sustainable, which is not in proportion with the available resources and carrying capacity of the Earth [3].Silent Spring by Racheal Carson, The Ecologist's A Blueprint for Survival, and The Population Bomb by Ehrlich are some early works that significantly impacted the world in the cradle stage of sustainable development during the 1960s.

        <p>The future and existence of humanity were described as "sustainability" in the British book Blueprint for Survival and a United Nations statement in 1978. Policy journals began using the word "sustainability" along with technical articles and studies around 1978. Most of these concentrated on the major sustainability domains and the environment. Soon, the World Bank started working to integrate sustainability into its organizational structure, operational procedures, and policy frameworks. Due to the fact that the term "sustainability" has roots in so many fundamentally different ideas, each with a compelling argument for its legitimacy, it seems futile to attempt to define it in a single sense [4]. The concept of sustainable development has acquired acceptance and significance theoretically. Its further development is frequently overlooked or minimized. While some people may think evolution is irrelevant, it may still be used to predict future trends and defects, which can be helpful now and in the future [5]. The unchecked economic expansion may cause the planet's carrying capacity to be exceeded and civilization to crumble. The ideas of sustainability and sustainable development, as a result, emerged [6].The future and existence of humanity were described as "sustainability" in the British book Blueprint for Survival and a United Nations statement in 1978.

        <p>The repercussions of anthropogenic activity and environmental devastation are becoming increasingly well-known, thanks to the media and publications. Works such as Limits of Growth or Small is Beautiful argued that economy-based development is unsustainable in this finite world of limited resources, and this started to question ongoing economic growth [7]. The early discourse was radical and demanded structural reform, arguing that capitalist economic development cannot be integrated with social and ecological development, which contradicts the concept of a sustainable world [8].The repercussions of anthropogenic activity and environmental devastation are becoming increasingly well-known, thanks to the media and publications.

        <p>Reiterating the need for SD, the "World Commission on Environment and Development", headed by Gro Harlem Brundtland of Norway, produced the Brundtland Report titled "Our Common Future" in 1987. The report defined sustainable development as "the development that meets the demands of the current generation without compromising the ability of the future generation to meet their own needs", as was already mentioned. The Rio Earth Summit, also known as the UNCED or Rio Earth Summit, was inspired by the Brundtland Report in 1992 [9]. The main subject of discussion at the UNCED was the report's recommendations. The conference outcome document for the UNCED included Agenda 21 as one of the critical sustainable development outcomes. It urged that national policies be devised and implemented to address the economic, social, and environmental components of sustainable development after stating that sustainable development should become an essential item on the international community's agenda [10]. The World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD), also known as Rio+10, was convened in Johannesburg in 2002 to assess the status of putting the Rio Earth Summit's outcomes into practice. The World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) introduced several multi-stakeholder partnerships for sustainable development and the Johannesburg Plan, an implementation plan for the measures outlined in Agenda 21 [11]. Figure 1 illustrates the sequence of activities associated with sustainable development. Rio+20, also known as the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD), occurred in 2012, 20 years after the first Rio Earth Summit. The conference's two main sustainable development topics were the green economy and an institutional framework. The conference conclusion document "The Future We Want" placed a strong emphasis on sustainable development to the point that the term "sustainable development" was used [13]. The Rio+20 outcomes included a procedure for creating new SDGs, which would go into effect in 2015 and promote targeted action regarding sustainable development in all areas of the global development agenda. SD was thus one of the five main objectives of the United Nations in 2012 (UN), highlighting the important part that sustainable development (SD) should play in national and international development policies, programs, and agendas [14].

        <p>The term "sustainability" is scrutinized by Albert Bartlett using different laws, hypotheses, observations, and predictions. They may not apply to small groups of people or to tribes living in primitive conditions as they are all based on populations and rates of resource and good consumption found in the world. The laws are more exacting than the hypotheses [19]. Though they are limited in many perspectives, some postulates may be proven correct by experience and given the status of laws. The observations may provide insight into the issues and possible solutions. These postulates can be classified into four categories: Population and consumption, Energy, Resource and Environment, and Humanand Society-centric (Table 2). [20].The term "sustainability" is scrutinized by Albert Bartlett using different laws, hypotheses, observations, and predictions.

        <p>First Law: Population growth and increase in the rates of consumption of resources cannot be sustained. Second Law: The difficulty of transforming a society, with more growth in population and higher consumption of resources, into being sustainable is higher. Third Law: Population Momentum: The response time of populations to changes in the human fertility rate is the average length of a human life. Fourth Law: The size of the population that can be sustained (the carrying capacity) and the sustainable average standard of living of the people are inversely related. Eighth Law: Sustainability requires that the size of the population be less than or equal to the carrying capacity of the ecosystem for the desired standard of living. Ninth Law: The benefits of population growth and growth in the rates of consumption of resources accrue to a few; all of society bears the costs of population growth and growth in the consumption of resources. Seventeenth Law: If, for whatever reason, humans fail to stop population growth and growth in the rates of consumption of resources, nature will eliminate these growths.First Law: Population growth and increase in the rates of consumption of resources cannot be sustained.

        <p>Tenth Law: Growth in the rate of consumption of a non-renewable resource, such as a fossil fuel, causes a dramatic decrease in the life expectancy of the resource. Eleventh Law: The time of expiration of non-renewable resources can be postponed, possibly for a very long time. Twelfth Law: When considerable efforts are made to improve the efficiency with which resources are used, the resulting savings are wholly and rapidly wiped out by the added resources consumed due to modest population increases. Thirteenth Law: The benefits of large efforts to preserve the environment are rapidly canceled by the added environmental demands resulting from small increases in the human population. Fourteenth Law: (Second Law of Thermodynamics) When rates of pollution exceed the natural cleansing capacity of the environment, it is easier to pollute than it is to clean up the environment.Tenth Law: Growth in the rate of consumption of a non-renewable resource, such as a fossil fuel, causes a dramatic decrease in the life expectancy of the resource.

        <p>Seventh Law: A society that has to import people to do daily work ("We can't find locals who will do the work") is not sustainable. Sixteenth Law: Humans will always be dependent on agriculture (This is the first of Malthus' two postulates).

        <p>Sustainable development can only be realized if a few principles are followed. However, the economy, environment, and society are typically prioritized when discussing the basics of sustainable development [21]. Population control, human resource manage-ment, ecological and biodiversity preservation, production systems, the preservation of progressive culture, and public participation are among the issues addressed [22].Sustainable development can only be realized if a few principles are followed.

        <p>One of the tenets of sustainable development is the preservation of the environment. Since all life would end without the environment and biodiversity, they must be protected. The Earth's finite resources cannot meet the population's needs and means. Natural resource extraction must not exceed the Earth's capacity for sustainable development because resource depletion hurts the ecosystem [23]. This suggests that development activities need to consider the Earth's capabilities. Due to this, having renewable energy sources, such as solar, is essential, rather than relying too heavily on hydroelectricity and things made from petroleum. To accomplish sustainable development, population control is also crucial [24]. People can live by using the limited resources of the Earth. The growing population raises human needs, such as those for food, clothing, and housing, but there are limits to how much the world's resources can be expanded to provide. Therefore, population management and control are essential for sustainable development [25]. Effective human resource management is another integral component of sustainable development. The individuals are in charge of seeing that the principles are upheld. The environment must be used wisely and protected by humans. It is up to individuals to maintain peace on Mother Earth [13]. The argument is built on the premise that sustainable development cannot be accomplished solely through the efforts of one person or organization, which alludes to the system's theory. All individuals and relevant organizations must share this obligation. The concept of participation, which calls for optimistic attitudes from the populace in order to make real progress while accepting responsibility and accountability for stability, is the cornerstone of sustainable development [24]. In order to achieve genuine, long-lasting change, participation entails the combined effort of numerous people and organizations who are all working toward a shared vision of sustainability. We are more likely to succeed if we recognize the responsibility that is placed on each of us as well as the power that comes from working together for a common goal [26].One of the tenets of sustainable development is the preservation of the environment.

        <p>Sustainable development requires promoting socially progressive traditions, behaviors, and political cultures. In order to maintain social cohesion and support environmental appreciation and preservation for sustainable development, advanced traditional and political culture must be developed, nurtured, and expanded [22]. The systematic integration of ecological, social, and economic considerations into all areas of outcome across generations can be summed up as the central tenet of sustainable development. A socially progressive culture is crucial for sustainable development because it enables people to understand their obligations to society and the environment. Therefore, in order to achieve sustainable development, a progressive traditional and political culture must be created. This can be achieved by implementing measures such as encouraging grassroots organizations to increase public awareness and participation in sustainable development initiatives [27].Sustainable development requires promoting socially progressive traditions, behaviors, and political cultures.

        <p>A systematic consensual and heuristic approach was used to arrive at sustainability principles based on studies of humans as a social species, the Laws of Thermodynamics, and the science behind them [28]. The lack of a comprehensive definition of "sustainability" and the recognition of the inherent issues involved in the current use of the term "sustainable development" served as the inspiration for this [29]. These pillars support several logical deductions about how social and ecological systems communicate. The guiding principles gradually evolved and were consented to after discussions with experts from the larger scientific community. A framework with logical guiding principles was used to apply the system conditions (Figure 2). These concepts effectively outline how the system parameters may be addressed using "back-casting".A systematic consensual and heuristic approach was used to arrive at sustainability principles based on studies of humans as a social species, the Laws of Thermodynamics, and the science behind them [28].

        <p>A sustainable structure is said to be built on three pillars. Three intersecting circles are a common visual depiction of sustainability and its dimensions [31]. Many research findings also use a nested approach with a particular dimension at the center. Present-day sustainable development is frequently represented by literal "pillars" supporting it. The hierarchy of the dimensions is highlighted in the schematic with the nested ellipses, with "environment" serving as the basis for the other two. Three interconnected "pillars", "dimensions", "components", "stool legs", "aspects", "perspectives", etc., are frequently used to describe sustainability and include economic, social, and environmental (or ecological) factors or "goals" [32]. It must be acknowledged that these conflicting terms are typically used synonymously, and our preference for "pillars" is largely arbitrary. The three intersecting circles of society, environment, and economy are frequently, though not always, used to represent this multi-stakeholder description, with sustainability situated at the crossroads. While frequently referred to as a "Venn diagram," this diagram frequently lacks the particularly emphasized attributes associated with such a construction. It describes "sustainability" in academic literature, policy documentation, business literature, and online [33].A sustainable structure is said to be built on three pillars.

The three intersecting circles of society, environment, and economy are frequently, though not always, used to represent this multi-stakeholder description, with sustainability situated at the crossroads. While frequently referred to as a "Venn diagram," this diagram frequently lacks the particularly emphasized attributes associated with such a construction. It describes "sustainability" in academic literature, policy documentation, business literature, and online [33].A sustainable structure is said to be built on three pillars. Three intersecting circles are a common visual depiction of sustainability and its dimensions [31]. Many research findings also use a nested approach with a particular dimension at the center. Present-day sustainable development is frequently represented by literal "pillars" supporting it. The hierarchy of the dimensions is highlighted in the schematic with the nested ellipses, with "environment" serving as the basis for the other two.

        <p>Alternative ways of expressing the three concepts include using nested concentric circles or actual "pillars" to represent them visually and using them independently of visual aids to represent distinct categories of sustainability objectives or metrics [34]. While captivating due to their simplicity, the meaning these diagrams and the larger "pillar" concept themselves convey is frequently ambiguous, restricting their ability to be coherently operationalized. However, the conceptual underpinnings of this description and the time when it entered popular culture are unclear, and its precise meaning is up for debate. The three-pillar conception has undoubtedly attained widespread acceptance, but this should not obscure its flaws [7].Alternative ways of expressing the three concepts include using nested concentric circles or actual "pillars" to represent them visually and using them independently of visual aids to represent distinct categories of sustainability objectives or metrics [34].

        <p>Critics argue that the sustainable development framework is not ambitious enough to address the scale and urgency of today's environmental and social challenges. Some also argue that focusing on economic growth and development can perpetuate the unsustainable use of natural resources and the unequal distribution of wealth and power. Some alternatives to traditional sustainable development have been proposed, including "Degrowth" and "Post-Development" [35,36]. Degrowth advocates for a reduction in consumption and production, particularly in wealthy countries, to reduce pressure on the environment and address social inequalities. Post-Development argues that the focus on economic growth has created a distorted view of development that prioritizes Western values and disregards the knowledge and values of marginalized communities [35,36]. Ultimately, the debate around sustainable development and its alternatives highlights the need for a more nuanced and inclusive approach to development that prioritizes both human well-being and environmental sustainability. In order to better navigate the turbulent and uncertain conditions that make up the post-Brundtland world, academics, development practitioners, environmental managers, sustainability advocates, and government planners must work together [37].Critics argue that the sustainable development framework is not ambitious enough to address the scale and urgency of today's environmental and social challenges.

        <p>Since the Brundtland Report was released, mainstream sustainable development has advanced rapidly. The notion of sustainable development is firmly rooted in many government offices, corporate boardrooms, and the hallways of international NGOs and financial institutions, despite the risk of cooptation and abuse, frequently resulting in a scaling-back of its more progressive prescriptions for achieving sustainability [38]. At the very least, its willingness to offer some commonality for deliberations among various development and environmental sectors, which are frequently at odds, can be used to explain why sustainable development has endured. Strongest proponents of the idea, such as those in international environmental NGOs and intergovernmental organizations, are thus at ease advancing a concept that most effectively converts former opponents into social constructivism, contending that understanding the world invariably entails a series of mediations between human social relations and individual identities. Critics also tend to conduct qualitative research based on a case study methodology and emphasize the historical contingency of development processes. Perhaps most significantly, proponents of traditional sustainable development still view the policy-making process as a legitimate means of reform [39].Since the Brundtland Report was released, mainstream sustainable development has advanced rapidly.

        <p>The framework assumes that three domains-the economy, the environment, and the social domain-should be considered when discussing sustainability [34]. These domains are claimed to connect as three separate spheres of life. Sustainability is foundational to public administration, policymaking, and political governance; variations of this three-domain framework can be found throughout all policy documents [40]. Despite this prevalence, the framework is infrequently subjected to sustained or in-depth stakeholder discussion. The economy (or profit), the environment (or ecology, the planet), and the social sector (or society, prosperity) are typically left as the framework for defining and operationalizing sustainability, with the economy typically leading the pack as the first between many "equals". This approach to sustainability is often seen as one that places too much emphasis on economic prosperity while not giving enough attention to social and environmental aspects. The idea of sustainability has become ubiquitous in the public sector, but its implementation and application often fail to capture the complex realities of social and environmental interdependencies [41]. In other words, economic factors have taken over almost all decision-making processes. They are viewed as fundamental to the human condition, defining and serving as a standard by which everything else is measured [42].The framework assumes that three domains-the economy, the environment, and the social domain-should be considered when discussing sustainability [34].

        <p>In order to envision and create a shared future, a deliberative political process is fundamentally required. In sustainability politics, resources are mobilized with an eye toward respect and harmony along multiple axes and over an extended period. Sustainability politics requires a unique approach to democratic deliberation that does not simply focus on immediate policy solutions but instead takes a broader and longer-term view of the impact of policies on society and the environment [44]. This approach enables us to identify and engage stakeholders, communities, and policy-makers in a shared vision of a sustainable future, allowing us to include all perspectives in the debate and reach equitable and effective decisions [44].In order to envision and create a shared future, a deliberative political process is fundamentally required.

        <p>The topic of system regulation and governance identifies a fourth fundamental category of organization; the political sphere, which regulates the relations between (and within) the environmental sphere and the economic and social spheres. Establishing conventions, laws, and institutional frameworks for controlling society's social, economic, and, indirectly, environmental spheres creates the political sphere [49]. The political sphere serves as the "referee" who settles disputes involving the various, frequently incompatible claims made by participants in the social and economic spheres, both for themselves and concerning other spheres, such as the environment. This occurs through the political sphere as an intermediary, highlighting that, rather than direct environmental "governance", there is frequently an indirect connection between the political and environmental spheres [50]. The transition from politics to the environment may involve the "supply" of public policy meant to impact how environmental systems operate. Environmental-social then social-political integrations or environmental-economic then economic-political integrations are two ways to communicate societal demands "on behalf of the environment" [51]. Establishing conventions and procedures for regulating each sphere in relation to the others, to ensure the concurrent respect for quality/performance goals of all three spheres, constitutes the political or governance dimension of the organization [10]. This is the area of arbitrage between various principles and asserts of concern, obtained de facto or on purpose through coercion and institutional arrangements ranging from town and county councils to national government institutions to United Nations and other active international organizations. This type of regulation is a powerful force and creates a system of checks and balances that protects the interests of society and the environment. Such regulation works to ensure that all interests and needs, both those of individuals and larger groups, are taken into account to produce an optimal outcome for everyone involved [38].The topic of system regulation and governance identifies a fourth fundamental category of organization; the political sphere, which regulates the relations between (and within) the environmental sphere and the economic and social spheres.

        <p>Along with sustainable development's environmental, social, and economic dimensions, culture has gained increasing attention in recent years. The protection of ecology and the environment is motivated by the environmental dimension. The economic dimension encourages the effective use of financial resources and aims for long-term benefits, whereas the social dimension concentrates on the needs of humans, both present and future [53]. Since culture was previously included in the social dimension of sustainability, it was not considered a separate dimension. The situation gradually changed, though culture is now acknowledged as crucial to achieving sustainable development [27]. A separate cultural dimension of sustainability has been established to focus on the protection of traditional values and lifestyles, as well as the preservation of tangible and intangible heritage [52]. This separation of culture from the social dimension of sustainability is significant due to globalization, which has led to increased displacement and destruction of traditional cultures.

        <p>The objectives can only be met if they are incorporated into every aspect of government. Due to the complementarities, achieving one aim may aid in attaining others at the same time. Consider how tackling climate change challenges could enhance energy security, human health, ecosystems, and marine health. The main characteristic of the SDGs is that they are not standalone goals. Most goals are interconnected and interdependent and are well-defined in their perspectives and their plan of action of applications. Interconnectedness implies that achieving one goal leads to supporting another; therefore, they should be seen as connecting frames of a holistic and harmonic prominent structure. This is the key feature of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which was adopted in 2015 by the United Nations [69]. There are 17 SDGs and recommendations for collaborative relationships among and within people, policy-makers, and other stakeholders worldwide. They address social, economic, and environmental concerns and promote sustainable perspectives from a broader viewpoint [58]. Hence, to pursue a sustainable world, the focus will be global collaboration and reducing inequalities and discrimination inside the states. Accordingly, all countries must work together to create a unified plan for implementing these goals, which can only be accomplished if each country accepts accountability for its conduct [23].The objectives can only be met if they are incorporated into every aspect of government.

In other words, environmental justice and sustainable development goals must all be addressed effectively in order to achieve the full range of objectives for global sustainability [73].</p>
        <p>The interpretation of definitions and concepts of sustainability and sustainable development is still incomplete, and the perspectives are different for stakeholders in various domains and spheres. Even though sustainability addresses the relation and harmony between environmental, economic, and social spheres more extensively, executing the concept in the present scenario must be very specific and introduce a holistic approach. The ecological and biological aspects must be considered to accomplish the sustainability goals, which have not yet been met. To get rid the planet of anthropogenic problems, an integrated approach is urgently and consistently needed [74].

        <p>Environmental pollution is a problem that affects both developed and developing nations, so it is a concern that is felt everywhere in the world. Researchers and decisionmakers are eager to learn about the causes and effects of environmental pollution to develop potential remedies because it makes the Earth uninhabitable for living things and significantly contributes to global climate change. According to researchers, if environmental pollution persists, many regions will be covered by water while others will turn into deserts. In addition, extreme temperatures may exist everywhere [78]. The primary goal of the modern world is to combat environmental pollution by taking practical steps to safeguard those of us who live on the planet while being careful not to upset ecological balances. People must start reducing their waste and implementing environmentally friendly behaviors such as recycling and composting if they want the planet to remain habitable [44]. Additionally, people must avoid using too much energy or water from the environment [79]. Assisting citizens in lowering their carbon footprints, launching awareness campaigns, and implementing new laws that will lessen the effects of climate change are all things that governments should be implementing as well [77].Environmental pollution is a problem that affects both developed and developing nations, so it is a concern that is felt everywhere in the world.

        <p>Another threat that is affecting more and more parts of the world is drought. Frequent cycles of drought and flooding have been brought on by climate change, and long stretches of water scarcity have led to desertification. Droughts have increased significantly over the past 40 years, particularly in the tropics and subtropics. The world has been experiencing water stress and environmental problems since the Anthropocene era, primarily attributed to human activity. One of the most noticeable effects of drought is on nutrient uptake because water is the medium by which nutrients are transported in plants [86]. Due to the unevenly distributed C, N, and microbial diversity caused by these adverse effects, the soil becomes infertile over time. In addition to biodiversity loss, wildfires, and soil erosion, drought harms habitats.Another threat that is affecting more and more parts of the world is drought.

        <p>The disappearance of biological diversity has grown into a complex and ongoing issue. Due to this, biological heterogeneity has decreased, which has led to an unprecedented decline in terrestrial and marine species, including flora and fauna, affecting the ecosystems' overall stability. The main issue is the extinction of plant species because they are crucial to keeping the ecosystem balanced and directly impact how it functions by providing a habitat for various other organisms [90]. Although extinction is a natural occurrence, there is no denying that a wide range of human activities also contributes to the loss of biological diversity. Over the past 40,000 years, extinctions due to human activity have increased. Within the next 240 years, the Earth will likely experience its sixth mass extinction if current trends hold [87]. In fact, some researchers contend that anthropogenic activities alone are to blame for the beginning of the sixth species mass extinction. Estimates indicate that artificial habitats have replaced natural vegetation on 43% of the Earth's land surface [88]. This century, the rate of extinction is predicted to rise by a factor of two; with accelerated climate change, this rate may grow even faster.The disappearance of biological diversity has grown into a complex and ongoing issue.

        <p>Climate change refers to the long-term changes in temperature, precipitation, wind patterns, and other measures of climate that occur over several decades or longer. It is primarily caused by burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and other human activities, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, trapping heat and warming the planet. Addressing climate change is, therefore, a key component of sustainable development. This can include reducing greenhouse gas emissions by increasing the use of renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, and implementing carbon pricing [74]. Additionally, adaptation measures such as building sea walls or drought-resistant crops can help communities and ecosystems cope with the impacts of a changing climate. Therefore, it is essential to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to the changes that are already happening and those that are projected to occur in the future. Climate change can negatively impact the balance of global society by increasing poverty, reducing access to food and water, and exacerbating health problems [110].

        <p>Natural disasters can have a significant impact on sustainability. They can cause loss of life and injury, damage infrastructure and buildings, and disrupt economic activity. Additionally, natural disasters can exacerbate poverty, inequality, and vulnerability, particularly among marginalized communities. Climate change is projected to increase the frequency and intensity of many natural disasters, such as floods, droughts, and storms. This makes sustainability even more important as it can help to build resilience to these events [112].Natural disasters can have a significant impact on sustainability.

        <p>Population growth can significantly impact sustainability, both positively and negatively. On the one hand, a larger population can lead to increased economic growth, technological innovation, and cultural diversity [106]. On the other hand, a rapidly growing population can strain natural resources and lead to environmental degradation, urbanization, and increased demand for energy, food, and water. One of the main concerns regarding population growth is its impact on the environment [115]. As the population increases, so does food, water, and energy demand. This can lead to the overconsumption of natural resources, deforestation, and pollution. Additionally, population growth can lead to urbanization and land-use changes, which can cause a loss in biodiversity and ecosystem services.Population growth can significantly impact sustainability, both positively and negatively.

        <p>The task of defining sustainability and sustainable development has been a complex and ongoing endeavor for researchers. The lack of a universally accepted definition stems from the diverse interpretations attributed to the phrase, particularly in relation to its association with "economic growth". This has sparked a debate among scholars, as some argue that traditional notions of development, synonymous with continuous economic expansion, are incompatible with sustainability, given the finite resources of our planet [119]. Bringing together the diverse perspectives of sustainability under a unified framework has proven to be a challenging task. Over the years, the definitions of sustainability have evolved while retaining their core essence [105]. However, there is still a need for a comprehensive explanation that can encompass all the different domains of sustainability. Additionally, it is important to acknowledge that the concept of sustainability is influenced by the economic growth and political ideologies prevalent in different nations. Table 4 presents a comparative analysis of different socio-economic growth models. Capitalism: Capitalism is an economic system in which the means of production, prices of commodities (goods and services), and distribution are privately owned and operated. The prices are determined by supply and demand in a competitive market [120]. In a capitalist economy, the goal is to make a profit, and businesses are free to operate and compete with one another [121].The task of defining sustainability and sustainable development has been a complex and ongoing endeavor for researchers.

Most generally, communism refers to community ownership of property, with the end goal being complete social equality via economic equality. Under communism, the goal is to create a society where everyone works according to their abilities and receives according to their needs [125]. Fundamentally, communism argues that all labor belongs to the individual laborer; no man can own another man's body, and therefore each man holds his work.Communism: Communism is a political and economic ideology that seeks to create a classless, stateless society in which the means of production and distribution are owned and controlled by the community as a whole [124].

        <p>The universally accepted capitalistic GDP growth-driven economic model, which has prevailed for the last century, has proven to be a complete failure and is leading us toward a disastrous path. Reliant on fossil fuel burning, this model exacerbates climate change, pollution, biodiversity loss, and freshwater depletion while reinforcing unequal wealth distribution. Its promises of economic success and improved quality of life for citizens have come at the expense of the environment and social equity. In summary, these socio-economic models have their drawbacks and challenges, and there is no one-sizefits-all solution for achieving sustainable economic growth and development. Urgent and comprehensive revaluation is needed to shift toward alternative mechanisms prioritizing sustainable development, incorporating concepts such as the circular economy, naturebased solutions, social innovation, and responsible consumption and production patterns, to ensure a resilient and equitable future for all. A more holistic and inclusive approach must be identified and developed to create a more sustainable and equitable future.The universally accepted capitalistic GDP growth-driven economic model, which has prevailed for the last century, has proven to be a complete failure and is leading us toward a disastrous path.

The role of sustainalists in the future will be crucial in promoting and advocating for sustainable practices and policies that prioritize the well-being of current and future generations [183]. Sustainalists will work toward creating a more equitable and environmentally responsible world by promoting environmentally friendly technologies and practices, reducing carbon emissions, preserving natural resources, and practicing social justice and equality. They will also play a key role in raising public awareness about the importance of sustainalism, and influencing businesses, governments, and the public to adopt a new socio-economic-environmental model of sustainalism. By working toward a more sustainable future, sustainalists will help ensure that the planet remains habitable and that future generations can thrive. Becoming a sustainalist involves incorporating sustainable principles and practices into your daily life and advocating for policies and initiatives that prioritize sustainability [183].</p>

        <p>Sustainability, closely related to sustainalism, is a relatively new concept that has gained widespread recognition and support in recent years, and this trend will likely continue. However, the ideas and values associated with sustainalism will likely continue to be meaningful and influential. As the global population continues to grow and the impacts of human activity on the environment become more apparent, there will likely be increasing emphasis on finding ways to live and consume more sustainably. We have an exceptional opportunity for individuals, sectors, companies, and organizations to go down in history as the generations that changed the course of the world for the better [183]. This may involve a focus on local communities, self-sufficiency, intergenerational equity, and other values and practices associated with sustainalism. A sustainable lifestyle consists of promoting social equity, diversity, inclusion, social justice, fair labor practices, advocating for human rights and reducing inequality. Adopting a sustainable lifestyle requires a shift in our attitudes, values, and beliefs. It requires us to recognize our interconnectedness with each other and the natural world. It also requires us to take collective responsibility for our actions and their impact on the environment and society.Sustainability, closely related to sustainalism, is a relatively new concept that has gained widespread recognition and support in recent years, and this trend will likely continue.

        <p>Sustainable revolution refers to a significant transformation at the global level to achieve a more sustainable future [184]. It involves a shift in values, attitudes, and behaviors toward sustainalism and adopting sustainable practices and policies at all levels of society, from individuals to governments and various states [185]. The sustainable revolution aims to create a more equitable and environmentally responsible world wherein economic growth is balanced with environmental protection and social justice. "Sustainable Era" refers to a time in which sustainalism is the dominant paradigm, and sustainable practices and policies are widely adopted and implemented. A strong focus on environmental protection, resource conservation, and social equity and the widespread adoption of sustainable technologies and practices characterizes the sustainable era. In this era, economic growth is decoupled from environmental degradation, and the world operates in a way that prioritizes the well-being and survival of both current and future generations. The sustainable era aims to create a more livable and sustainable world for all.Sustainable revolution refers to a significant transformation at the global level to achieve a more sustainable future [184].

        <p>In conclusion, sustainability has emerged as a crucial response to environmental degradation, social inequality, and economic instability. However, traditional approaches to sustainable development have proven inadequate in tackling these complex challenges, necessitating a more comprehensive and holistic approach.In conclusion, sustainability has emerged as a crucial response to environmental degradation, social inequality, and economic instability.

        <p>To address these limitations and foster a paradigm shift toward a more sustainable and inclusive world, this paper proposes an integrated socio-economic and environmental model, the 6S principles of global sustainability. We have presented a novel perspective on achieving sustainable development goals through a social movement centered around sustainable education, sustainable living, peace, social justice, social equity, sustainable housing, sustainable networks (including mobility and health infrastructure), and sustainable energy. The 6S theoretical framework offers a clear roadmap toward achieving global sustainability and effectively tackles the challenges related to sustainability through an inclusive approach.To address these limitations and foster a paradigm shift toward a more sustainable and inclusive world, this paper proposes an integrated socio-economic and environmental model, the 6S principles of global sustainability.

        <p>To enhance individual responsibility toward sustainable development, the concept of sustainalism is introduced. Building upon the principles of sustainalism, the Global Sustainability Framework recognizes the interconnectedness of different dimensions of sustainability and the diverse Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It highlights the importance of collective action, dedication, and collaboration among individuals, organizations, and governments for a fair and inclusive quality of life. Sustainalists adopt this new way of thinking and practice, recognizing the interdependence of all living beings and advocating for social and environmental justice.To enhance individual responsibility toward sustainable development, the concept of sustainalism is introduced.

        <p>Implementing the Global Sustainability Framework and embracing sustainalism necessitates a sustainable revolution-an unprecedented collective movement to reshape our societies, economies, and governance systems toward sustainability. The sustainable revolution offers a transformative pathway toward achieving an equitable world, marking a significant step toward a sustainable era.Implementing the Global Sustainability Framework and embracing sustainalism necessitates a sustainable revolution-an unprecedented collective movement to reshape our societies, economies, and governance systems toward sustainability.
