        <p>Our study focuses on how public policy can effectively increase collaboration for innovation among firms, entrepreneurs, research institutions and the public sector in a way that is easily accessible and beneficial for SMEs. In recommending Local Open Innovation (LOI), this paper helps to shape regional innovation policies by strengthening regional networks to efficiently facilitate collaborative innovation. Considering cognitive barriers and constrained resources and capabilities for applying open innovation (OI) in SMEs with unrestricted scope, a local approach offers advantages to facilitating OI. In light of our findings, we present the impact of such a policy mechanism on the adoption of OI, the unique combination of features of the LOI process, and how they affect collaboration. We also present the respective stakeholder relations, barriers preventing SMEs from engaging in OI and potential remedies LOI offers to overcome these barriers. We conclude with varieties of LOI for strengthening regional development in different contexts.Our study focuses on how public policy can effectively increase collaboration for innovation among firms, entrepreneurs, research institutions and the public sector in a way that is easily accessible and beneficial for SMEs.

        <p>Policymakers have launched many initiatives to stimulate the adoption of Open Innovation (OI). Given the reluctance of small and medium sized enterprises (SME) to engage in OI, policy initiatives strive to encourage them to open up in order to foster technological progress and economic growth. Public institutions even provide consulting services to counter associated risks (Carayannis &amp; Meissner, 2017); however, to effectively increase collaboration for innovation in SMEs, not all OI strategies, policy mechanisms and frameworks may be equally appropriate. Taking into account the fact that some firms, especially smaller ones, face resource and capability constraints or cognitive barriers regarding the adoption of OI, major benefits such as reaching external knowledge and distant experts with unrestricted scope may be difficult to use (Chesbrough, Vanhaverbeke &amp; West, 2014; Van de Vrande, De Jong, Vanhaverbeke, &amp; De Rochemont, 2009). A locally bound approach can offer advantages in this context. Especially when it comes to research and development, SMEs rather stay closed, developing internally without benefitting from external input. Hence, it would be beneficial to effectively increase collaboration for innovation between firms, entrepreneurs, research institutions and the public sector in a way that is easily accessible and beneficial for SMEs. A specific form of OI is Local Open Innovation (LOI), which constitutes a local intermediated network approach established by a regional development agency together with practitioners and innovation management scholars. The objective of LOI is to collaborate on concrete problems in order to innovate while establishing a regional innovation ecosystem of diverse organizations within a community.Policymakers have launched many initiatives to stimulate the adoption of Open Innovation (OI).

        <p>Considerable public policy has focused on regional innovation systems (see recent editorial and special issue on regional innovation policies by González-López, Asheim and Sánchez-Carreira, 2019). Referring to research on both regional studies and facilitating open innovation, Shearmur and Doloreux (2016) summarize that innovation occurs more eagerly in urban settings or clusters, which generate local buzz and allow access to external actors. A main theme in SME research is access to inter-firm knowledge networks that are considered a crucial element for the economic success and competitiveness of regions (Asheim, Isaksen, Nauwelaers &amp; Tödtling, 2003;Bathelt, Malmberg &amp; Maskell, 2004;Rutten &amp; Boekema, 2007).Considerable public policy has focused on regional innovation systems (see recent editorial and special issue on regional innovation policies by González-López, Asheim and Sánchez-Carreira, 2019).

        <p>At the firm level, this is recognized as a means to secure competitive advantage by accessing external knowledge and facilitating innovation (Dyer &amp; Hatch, 2006;Gulati, 2007;Huggins &amp; Johnston, 2010;Kogut, 2000;Lavie, 2006;Owen-Smith &amp; Powell, 2004). Given the manifold theoretically derived necessity to form, manage and exploit external networks, various literature streams in innovation management also recognize that resource constraints and low levels of absorptive capacity constitute substantial barriers (Alexander &amp; Martin, 2013;Billington &amp; Davidson, 2013;Carayannis &amp; Meissner, 2017). Since these constraints are typical conditions of SMEs, the LOI approach is a suitable means for public policy to help smaller firms build local networks (Cohen &amp; Levinthal, 1990;Huggins &amp; Johnston, 2010).At the firm level, this is recognized as a means to secure competitive advantage by accessing external knowledge and facilitating innovation (Dyer &amp; Hatch, 2006;Gulati, 2007;Huggins &amp; Johnston, 2010;Kogut, 2000;Lavie, 2006;Owen-Smith &amp; Powell, 2004).

        <p>While the benefits of OI are recognized, relevant public policy for OI is less thoroughly understood, not least because of the remaining challenge of uncertainty in innovation as discussed by Bogers, Chesbrough and Moedas (2018). The motivations, structures and outcomes of these efforts lack empirical analysis (Bogers et al., 2017;Santos &amp; Mendonça, 2017). Furthermore, we could greatly benefit from better understanding best mechanisms to implement OI since despite the extensively researched advantages, many SMEs struggle with the adoption of OI (Chesbrough, Vanhaverbeke &amp; West, 2014; Van de Vrande, De Jong, Vanhaverbeke, &amp; De Rochemont, 2009). Furthermore, there is relatively little literature focusing directly on innovation policy instruments (Martin, 2016), and a lack of research regarding OI outside the firm environment, such as in networks, innovation systems, and public policies (Santos, 2015), as well as a need for more evidence-based innovation policymaking (Dosso, Martin &amp; Moncada-Paternò-Castello, 2018). Therefore, the problem addressed in this study is how to effectively increase collaboration for innovation of private productive sector organizations in a manner that is suitable for firms with high resource and capability constraints.While the benefits of OI are recognized, relevant public policy for OI is less thoroughly understood, not least because of the remaining challenge of uncertainty in innovation as discussed by Bogers, Chesbrough and Moedas (2018).

        <p>Following Bogers et al. (2017), Santos and Mendonça (2017), and Svare and Gausdal (2015), this study aims to answer recent calls for practical, manageable policy instruments to stimulate regional innovation systems. Suggesting LOI as an empirical concept to describe an observed phenomenon that has already proven successful in Canada, this study helps shape policy to effectively use funds and, more importantly, regional networks to facilitate OI. We strive to demonstrate empirical evidence about the impact of LOI as a means for public policy to facilitate the adoption of OI by private productive sector organizations in various industries.Following Bogers et al.

        <p>The implementation of this approach has led to the development of expertise by an intermediary organization, which subsequently extended its use to other cities, regions and industrial clusters.The implementation of this approach has led to the development of expertise by an intermediary organization, which subsequently extended its use to other cities, regions and industrial clusters.</p>
        <p>These initial experiences from the perspective of the involved practitioners and the regional development agency have been shared with the innovation management community (Berger- Masson, 2013;Deutsch, 2013), and are now complemented by a theoretical underpinning and further empirical data eight years after the initiation of the local approach. A unique feature of LOI is to combine OI methods, i.e., the broadcast search mechanism, typically used in online settings to reach out to a global mass of potential solution providers, with a local face-to-face event that is similar to collaborative and problem-oriented "hackathon" events. LOI contributes to the discussion on regional and industry dimensions that could make a difference for interorganizational networking and its outcomes (Oliver &amp; Ebers, 1998). Situating LOI in the broader context of public policy ambitions to facilitate innovation, Figure 1 introduces the basic framework that will be extended throughout this study. This paper is structured as follow. First, we derive the theoretical underpinning of a local intermediated network approach and its potential for the adoption of OI in SMEs. We then present empirical data from an in-depth case study including interviews supplemented by additional sources, i.e. surveys, observations and archival data (Eisenhardt, 1989;Yin, 2017).These initial experiences from the perspective of the involved practitioners and the regional development agency have been shared with the innovation management community (Berger- Masson, 2013;Deutsch, 2013), and are now complemented by a theoretical underpinning and further empirical data eight years after the initiation of the local approach.

        <p>Regarding the interviews with the three stakeholder groups that participated in LOI events (solution seeking firms, problem solvers, public actors as network promoters), for the purpose of this study, the focus lies on the public actors as network promoters, e.g. regional development facilitators. As a result of the data analysis, we present the characteristics of the LOI process and how they can increase collaboration for innovation in SMEs and regional development.Regarding the interviews with the three stakeholder groups that participated in LOI events (solution seeking firms, problem solvers, public actors as network promoters), for the purpose of this study, the focus lies on the public actors as network promoters, e.g. regional development facilitators.

        <p>Defined as "a distributed innovation process that relies on purposively managed knowledge flows across organizational boundaries, using pecuniary and non-pecuniary mechanisms in line with the organization's business model to guide and motivate knowledge sharing" (Chesbrough &amp; Bogers, 2014, p. 24), the concept of OI has had a tremendous impact on innovation practice and is a widely-debated paradigm in innovation management research. As a firm-centric paradigm, OI is primarily concerned with leveraging external knowledge to improve internal innovation processes such as technical problem solving in order to increase the firm's performance (Piller &amp; West, 2014). Depending on the level of openness, the possible institutional arrangements for external capability and knowledge transfer include dyadic research contracts, in-and out-licensing or IP agreements, but also network-based approaches (Janssen, Castaldi &amp; Alexiev, 2018), such as the often tournament-based crowdsourcing via the broadcast search mechanism (Dahlander &amp; Gann, 2010;West &amp; Bogers, 2014). The latter is a thriving method, often distributed through online platforms, where specific problems are dispersed to a mass of diverse problem solvers who can self-select to a problem and submit a solution (Afuah &amp; Tucci, 2012;Jeppesen &amp; Lakhani, 2010).Defined as "a distributed innovation process that relies on purposively managed knowledge flows across organizational boundaries, using pecuniary and non-pecuniary mechanisms in line with the organization's business model to guide and motivate knowledge sharing" (Chesbrough &amp; Bogers, 2014, p. 24), the concept of OI has had a tremendous impact on innovation practice and is a widely-debated paradigm in innovation management research.

        <p>Whereas OI has found widespread acceptance, especially in large multinational enterprises, one of the OI literature streams focuses solely on adoption and implementation strategies in SMEs (Brunswicker &amp; Vanhaverbeke, 2015;Spithoven, Vanhaverbeke, &amp; Roijakkers, 2013;Wynarczyk, 2013;). This research stream has identified multiple benefits of OI in terms of increasing innovative performance. However, scholars have also recognized multiple barriers (Bigliardi &amp; Galati, 2016;Radziwon &amp; Bogers, 2018;Usman, Roijakkers, Vanhaverbeke &amp; Frattini, 2018), suggesting that OI research has failed to some extent in promoting the right setting for widespread adoption among SMEs (Parida, Westerberg &amp; Frishammar, 2012). Many SMEs lack resources as well as the absorptive capacity to manage OI (Carayannis &amp; Meissner, 2017). Whereas large companies often develop so-called internal 'knowledge gatekeepers' to seek new opportunities and engage in knowledge transfer, this type of inter-organizational intermediation is often too resource-intensive for smaller companies, as they are unable to bear the cost of such dedicated roles (Alexander &amp; Martin, 2013). The same applies to other concepts such as the development of organizational learning routines that require resources difficult for SMEs to provide, for instance, dedicated managers to coordinate multiple networks or OI online platforms to find the appropriate approach for the respective problem (Billington &amp; Davidson, 2013).Whereas OI has found widespread acceptance, especially in large multinational enterprises, one of the OI literature streams focuses solely on adoption and implementation strategies in SMEs (Brunswicker &amp; Vanhaverbeke, 2015;Spithoven, Vanhaverbeke, &amp; Roijakkers, 2013;Wynarczyk, 2013;).

        <p>Other than the resource constraints of SMEs, cultural or psychological aspects constitute further OI barriers such as the Not-Invented-Here Syndrome (Antons &amp; Piller, 2015), or the challenge for R&amp;D professionals to proclaim that they are not able to solve a problem in their field of expertise, struggling with the need to re-define their professional identity from problemsolver to solution-seeker (Lifshitz-Assaf, 2016). Another main barrier that eventually emerges is the fear that competitors will gain sensitive knowledge when revealing technical problems. Thus, management choices on the degree of openness within SMEs depend on the nature of the appropriation strategies available to the organization (Freel &amp; Robson, 2016).Other than the resource constraints of SMEs, cultural or psychological aspects constitute further OI barriers such as the Not-Invented-Here Syndrome (Antons &amp; Piller, 2015), or the challenge for R&amp;D professionals to proclaim that they are not able to solve a problem in their field of expertise, struggling with the need to re-define their professional identity from problemsolver to solution-seeker (Lifshitz-Assaf, 2016).

        <p>To conquer their liability of smallness, a repeatedly proposed solution to support collaboration for innovation in SMEs is an intermediated network approach (Knockaert et al., 2014;Lee et al., 2010). Intermediaries are defined as "organizations that provide a supportive role for collaboration between two or more parties during various stages of the innovation process" (De Silva, Howells &amp; Meyer, 2018, p. 70;Howells, 2006, p. 720). As Howells (2006) undeniably demonstrates, scholars have attributed different terms, activities and roles to such organizations. Acknowledging their blending and overlaps, Howells (2006) clusters them into four categories: diffusion and technology transfer, innovation management, innovation management systems and networks and, finally, intermediaries as service organizations. For the conceptual framework of this study, we increase the density of these clusters to only differentiate between two main intermediary roles. First, intermediaries as service organizations, functioning as methodical experts of facilitating OI processes and activities. This view corresponds among others to Czarnitzki and Spielkamp (2003), Pilorget (1993), Wolpert (2002), focusing on the innovation management aspect of advising other organizations as consultants. Second, the three remaining closely related clusters focusing on the relational, boundary-spanning aspect of bridging ties to exploit the network synergy potential and the transformation of occurring collaboration intentions into actual realization (Hargadon &amp; Sutton, 1997;Stankiewicz, 1995;Watkins &amp; Horley, 1986). Following Lynn, Reddy andAram (1996), andMcEvily andZaheer (1999) we highlight the role of public actors in this second role, i.e. regional institutions that provide proactive advice and bridging ties (unique, non-redundant ties in a network). In line with Howells (2006;2018), and closely following Knockaert et al. (2014, p. 380) and Lee et al. (2010, p. 299), we define an intermediated network approach for SMEs as a mechanism initiated and conducted by one or more intermediaries who facilitate collaboration between two or more parties during various stages of the innovation process, their main mission being technology and knowledge transfer and network creation, which takes account of SMEs' limited ability in searching for partners and contributes to building trust among network members.To conquer their liability of smallness, a repeatedly proposed solution to support collaboration for innovation in SMEs is an intermediated network approach (Knockaert et al., 2014;Lee et al., 2010).

        <p>As pointed out by Castellaci, Grodal, Mendonca and Wibe (2005), innovation studies need not only to deepen on the organizational level, but also on the systematic level, i.e. linking actors and structure. Within this view of "innovation systems" (IS), the interactive learningbased approach views IS as a combination of relations between economic agents where knowledge is transmitted at a national, regional, local or sectoral level of the economy. The approach aims to draw attention to relations and interaction as knowledge creation processes that explain socio-economic change, and eventually to develop innovation policy based on a deeper understanding of innovation processes in terms of interactive learning. One of the challenges for future research on systems of innovation requires that boundaries of IS (Edquist, 2004) be defined. In the 'regional innovation systems' (RIS) approach, boundaries are geographically determined, meaning that a system is identified within the boundaries of a nation or a region. According to RIS scholars, geographical clustering of economic activity promotes localized learning, because of the local embeddedness of economically relevant knowledge. In the long run, this tends to drive the endogenous growth of regions (Maskell &amp; Malmberg, 1999;Morgan, 1997). Cluster theory then emphasizes that each territory requires specific regional innovation policies to leverage its strengths (Porter, 1998;2000;2003). Strong regional clusters positively influence the growth of regional industries in terms of employment and patenting as well as the emergence of new regional industries (Delgado et al., 2014). The strength of other clusters both in the region and in adjacent regions also increases regional industry growth.As pointed out by Castellaci, Grodal, Mendonca and Wibe (2005), innovation studies need not only to deepen on the organizational level, but also on the systematic level, i.e. linking actors and structure.

        <p>Regional innovation policies could lead to smart specialization strategies in line with its particular trajectory (Gonzalez-Lopez et al., 2019). Qualitative indicators such as control and governance parameters (value network, technical architecture), value and public value parameters (financial architecture, value proposition) can be used to evaluate smart city strategies in an economy undergoing digital transition as part of local policy to increase the problem-solving capability of communities and cities (Walravens, 2015). Usages of network infrastructures and Internet-based applications allow for new forms of collaboration among local governments, research institutions, universities, companies, and even citizens within the context of open innovation (Komninos, Pallot &amp; Schaffers, 2013). Approaches such as Living Labs involve users in combination with all the other stakeholders to stimulate the emergence of breakthrough ideas, concepts and scenarios in order to bridge the gap between technology push and application pull. These are particularly valuable to SMEs for their access to technology infrastructures, science and innovation services.Regional innovation policies could lead to smart specialization strategies in line with its particular trajectory (Gonzalez-Lopez et al., 2019).

        <p>Acknowledging the pivotal role of social capital for regional innovation systems (Cooke, 1992;Cooke, Uranga &amp; Etxebarria, 1997;Doloreux &amp; Parto, 2005;Laursen, Masciarelli &amp; Prencipe, 2012;Rutten &amp; Boekema, 2007;Yoon, Yun, Lee &amp; Phillips, 2015), scholars emphasize the importance for research to focus on inter-firm networks for SMEs as they are perceived as a crucial element for the economic success and competitiveness of regions (Asheim et al., 2003, Bathelt et al., 2004, Rutten &amp; Boekema, 2007), as well as a model for entrepreneurial firm growth (BarNir &amp; Smith, 2002;Iturrioz, Aragón, &amp; Narvaiza, 2015;Lechner &amp; Dowling, 2010;Molina-Morales &amp; Martínez-Fernández, 2010). Not only connecting with other SMEs but also integrating into the supply chains of larger firms allow smaller firms to benefit from symbiotic relationships arising from the expanded network (Dana, 2001;Etemad, Wright &amp; Dana, 2001). Social capital is defined as the resources available to individuals and groups through membership in social networks, i.e. the connections among individuals in social networks and the norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness that arise from them (Putnam, 2001). As Coleman (1998) puts it, social capital is anything that facilitates individual or collective action, generated by networks of relationships, reciprocity, trust, and social norms. It necessary for successful cooperation in a network, positively affecting resource exchange and combination in order to innovate (Tsai &amp; Ghoshal, 1998).Acknowledging the pivotal role of social capital for regional innovation systems (Cooke, 1992;Cooke, Uranga &amp; Etxebarria, 1997;Doloreux &amp; Parto, 2005;Laursen, Masciarelli &amp; Prencipe, 2012;Rutten &amp; Boekema, 2007;Yoon, Yun, Lee &amp; Phillips, 2015), scholars emphasize the importance for research to focus on inter-firm networks for SMEs as they are perceived as a crucial element for the economic success and competitiveness of regions (Asheim et al., 2003, Bathelt et al., 2004, Rutten &amp; Boekema, 2007), as well as a model for entrepreneurial firm growth (BarNir &amp; Smith, 2002;Iturrioz, Aragón, &amp; Narvaiza, 2015;Lechner &amp; Dowling, 2010;Molina-Morales &amp; Martínez-Fernández, 2010).

        <p>As a practical application of a network approach, also in this rich literature stream, intermediaries are renowned to create a network for idea generation, problem solving and acquiring resources (Cromie, Birley &amp; Callaghan, 1993;Hingley, Lindgreen &amp; Beverland, 2010). Whereas both spatially proximate and distant interactions between firms are of great value for the innovative performance of SMEs (Doran, Jordan &amp; O'Leary, 2012), local networks are important for firms unable to engage in frequent distant network interaction. In this context, Knoben and Oerlemans (2006) discuss with an in-depth literature review why geographical proximity is not a necessity for successful knowledge sharing and might even decrease knowledge variety, while also indicating alternative forms of proximity as (more) important factors for knowledge transfer. However, regarding trust building and the exchange of tacit knowledge and resources through (serendipitous) face-to-face interactions, the aspect of spatial proximity is recognized as an important factor of network structure and operation (Capello &amp; Faggian, 2005;Davenport, 2005;Giuliani, 2007;Iyer et al., 2005;Lorenzen, 2007;Pittaway et al., 2004;Westlund &amp; Bolton, 2003).As a practical application of a network approach, also in this rich literature stream, intermediaries are renowned to create a network for idea generation, problem solving and acquiring resources (Cromie, Birley &amp; Callaghan, 1993;Hingley, Lindgreen &amp; Beverland, 2010).

        <p>Intra-organizational networks can be used as a strategic resource shaped by managerial actions that enable knowledge flows both in an informal and tacit way, and in a rather formal and explicit way. Drawing on Coleman's (1988) definition of social capital and implying a spatial perspective, Huggins and Johnston (2010) argue that, in both cases, knowledge flows depend on the trustworthiness of the social environment, the information flow capabilities of social structure, and norms accompanied by sanctions. Hence, the creation of localized trust within the social environment is a main objective when establishing inter-organizational networks in order to facilitate the transfer and connection of knowledge, continuously reinforcing the cycle of knowledge creation (Iyer et al., 2005). Therefore, we focus on a local intermediated network approach for SMEs, which adds a local emphasis on the definition above. This implies not only the spatial restriction to a region, but also that the (second mentioned) role of the intermediary focusing on the relational, boundary-spanning aspect of bridging ties is fulfilled by a regional institution (Hargadon &amp; Sutton, 1997;Howells, 2006;Lynn et al. 1996;McEvily &amp; Zaheer, 1999;Stankiewicz, 1995;Watkins &amp; Horley, 1986).Intra-organizational networks can be used as a strategic resource shaped by managerial actions that enable knowledge flows both in an informal and tacit way, and in a rather formal and explicit way.

        <p>Following the logic of the regional innovation systems approach (Cooke, 1992), public policy initiatives attempt to facilitate innovation and growth of SMEs by encouraging them to collaborate with external institutions across industries and organizational boundaries in order to increase social capital in inter-firm knowledge networks (Cooke &amp; Wills, 1999;Inkpen &amp; Tsang, 2005;Partanen, Möller, Westerlund, Rajala &amp; Rajala, 2008). Reducing associated costs and risks, these SME-focused programs include state funding for R&amp;D projects, dedicated innovation managers and initiatives to facilitate networking between business and science. In contrast, direct policy measures include the provision of direct incentives for R&amp;D, such as R&amp;D subsidies, government tax credits and loans. However, research has shown that market failure increasingly relates to the transfer and flows of information between firms or between firms and public research organizations rather than to the actual production of R&amp;D itself (Autio, Kanninen, &amp; Gustafsson, 2008). Therefore, indirect policy measures focus on networkfacilitating activities such as financing of science parks, incubation centers, business network initiatives and technology intermediaries (Knockaert et al., 2014). In this context, it is crucial to identify and refine promising policy means for SMEs, since existing policy plans are questioned by practitioners.Following the logic of the regional innovation systems approach (Cooke, 1992), public policy initiatives attempt to facilitate innovation and growth of SMEs by encouraging them to collaborate with external institutions across industries and organizational boundaries in order to increase social capital in inter-firm knowledge networks (Cooke &amp; Wills, 1999;Inkpen &amp; Tsang, 2005;Partanen, Möller, Westerlund, Rajala &amp; Rajala, 2008).

        <p>There are pivotal regional aspects affecting the possibilities for institutional support such as differences between urban and peripheral regions or the number and diversity of research institutions (Doloreux &amp; Dionne, 2008;Masiello, Izzo &amp; Canoro, 2015). Referring to regional studies and open innovation research, Shearmur and Doloreux (2016) conclude that innovation happens more fervently in urban settings or clusters, which generate local buzz and allow access to external actors. Firm size plays an important role in that context since small firms consider knowledge of external actors outside the region to be less important than larger firms do. In choosing regional development instruments that fit the current state of the target firms, it is important to consider that small firms, and especially those engaged in incremental innovations, are more likely to be locally embedded (Freel, 2003). Finding a balance between the advantages of local embeddedness and localized trust in contrast to advantages of accessing external knowledge by engaging in distant search is a key challenge in establishing a regional innovation ecosystem that aims to integrate organizations that are not used to collaborating on a larger scale.There are pivotal regional aspects affecting the possibilities for institutional support such as differences between urban and peripheral regions or the number and diversity of research institutions (Doloreux &amp; Dionne, 2008;Masiello, Izzo &amp; Canoro, 2015).

        <p>Consistent with related research streams from innovation systems (Stankiewicz, 1995), social capital in RIS (Cromie et al., 1993;Hingley et al., 2010) and knowledge intensive business services (Castaldi, Faber &amp; Kishna, 2013), OI research suggests tackling this challenge through knowledge brokers and boundary spanners (Vanhaverbeke &amp; Cloodt, 2014;Zeng, Xie &amp; Tam, 2010). In order to provide support for SMEs, current research highlights the need for policy-makers to focus on such open innovation intermediaries to stimulate interaction with external knowledge sources through networking (De Silva et al., 2018;Knockaert et al., 2014).Consistent with related research streams from innovation systems (Stankiewicz, 1995), social capital in RIS (Cromie et al., 1993;Hingley et al., 2010) and knowledge intensive business services (Castaldi, Faber &amp; Kishna, 2013), OI research suggests tackling this challenge through knowledge brokers and boundary spanners (Vanhaverbeke &amp; Cloodt, 2014;Zeng, Xie &amp; Tam, 2010).

        <p>Building on the above conceptualizations of intermediaries and a local intermediated network approach for SMEs, we emphasize that for LOI in particular, we distinguish between two complementary intermediary roles.

The other intermediary role is the OI expert and event facilitator, referred to as "consultancy intermediary."Building on the above conceptualizations of intermediaries and a local intermediated network approach for SMEs, we emphasize that for LOI in particular, we distinguish between two complementary intermediary roles.

        <p>Conflating the elements of the conceptual reasoning above, Figure 2 In order to gain a deeper understanding of how policy instruments can facilitate the adoption of OI, qualitative explorative research is appropriate to enrich theory by studying an empirical concept to describe an observed phenomenon in an under-researched context (Eisenhardt, 1989;Yin, 2017). Since novel findings are expected, the research method needs to be open to new insights. In this regard, a qualitative research method is most useful. As discussed by Yin (2017) and Eisenhardt (1989), a single source case study is the most adequate method for the present purpose as it enables to gain deep insights into various data types that, when combined together, give a complete picture in order to understand how the phenomenon works. Regarding the techniques for analyzing case study data, Yin (2017) suggests that an open-ended research question leads to the use of an explanation-building technique, which involves deliberately entertaining rival explanations. Using a single case design that has embedded subcases reinforces this, rather than keeping the case holistic, meaning that starting from one focal firm, multiple units of analysis are investigated. We conducted the qualitative study over four months, which involved the analysis of archival data, direct observations and interviews.Conflating the elements of the conceptual reasoning above, Figure 2 In order to gain a deeper understanding of how policy instruments can facilitate the adoption of OI, qualitative explorative research is appropriate to enrich theory by studying an empirical concept to describe an observed phenomenon in an under-researched context (Eisenhardt, 1989;Yin, 2017).

Moreover, in the development process, we shared our understanding with other researchers to further inform the conceptualizations with regard to related research fields. Open-ended interview questions make it possible to follow an emergent, non-linear methodological approach as they offer richer and more extensive insights by revealing how participants refer to their personal situation to construct reality (Yin, 2017).While looking for evidence that might inform existing theory, we were open to existing and emerging constructs.

        <p>Interviews lasted between 60 and 90 minutes. Each interview was audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The coding was conducted in multiple iterations (as outlined above) using 
            <rs type="software">QDA Miner</rs> software. The data analysis to compare and discuss the results, as well as modifications to the coding table when appropriate, were carried out by two investigators (Kolbe &amp; Burnett, 1991;Perreault &amp; Leigh, 1989). Interviews were analyzed one by one (Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994), followed by a comparison between them (Yin, 2017) to identify common patterns. To explain similarities and differences in the interview data, the investigators kept referring to the literature during this iterative process, since inconsistencies with the literature may lead to opportunities to uncover deeper meaning and ultimately to proposals that could explain the phenomenon (Eisenhardt, 1989). Given that the local approach they have developed is significantly different from established concepts in previous OI literature, and that it can be deemed successful over the past eight years, it is an interesting data source for an explorative case study on regional development instruments promoting collaboration for innovation in SMEs. Referring to the approach as "Local Open Innovation" seems to be paradoxical in terms of wording since OI is usually used on the largest possible scale. In contrast to the "connectors and bridges between innovation and digital strategies" portrayed by Komninos (2016), our approach uses OI in two counterintuitive ways: local and offline.

The data show that most responding firms found a solution or valuable solution approach to their problem. However, a potentially positive response bias must of course be considered.</p>

        <p>The iterative data analysis of all four interview-sections of the semi-structured interviews makes it possible to identify the dominant characteristics of the LOI approach. These characteristics and their indicated effect on collaboration shed light on how the geographically local approach can increase collaboration for innovation across distant knowledge spheres. The characteristics and their assumed effects are presented in Table 2 along with sample quotes from regional network promoters. The findings are consistent with the interview data from seekers and solvers, whose data representation was purposefully omitted to avoid data saturation and maintain a clear focus on the public policy context. "Because, to be honest, me and my colleague, we were not sure about the do-it-yourself "arts and crafts" aspect of the afternoon with En mode solutions. We said, 'Well, let's see!

        <p>1. Anxiety about intellectual property rights (IPR). 2. Organizational culture aspects in the sense of a lack of an innovation culture, especially the willingness to admit to not being able to solve a problem within the firm, and the disturbance of day-to-day business. Both the anxiety about intellectual property rights as well as the reluctance to (publicly) admit to not being able to solve a problem internally were addressed in private discussions between the network promoter and the seeker firm after the invitation to submit a problem was sent. Initially curious but hesitant firms could be convinced to try LOI due to long-term relations and localized trust between these organizations, together with the reassuring fact that the revealed information stays within the regional community in contrast to an unknown mass of global solversincluding global competitorson OI online platforms. Network promoters were able to mitigate the anxiety about IPR issues by convincing firms that it makes more sense for them to protect the final solution, but to pursue an "open-source" style during the problemsolving event. The aim is to share information about the problem itself and to allow for a collaborative brainstorming process where participants build on each other's ideas to generate potential solutions. Nevertheless, during the first events, the network promoter also offered onsite consultation with an IPR specialist, which was eventually not needed in that context. The LOI approach mitigates the lack of resources hindering SMEs from initially engaging in a new innovation management method, as it does not require knowledge or monetary investments prior to the event. For SMEs, it is good practice to have an engineer or manager of the respective department and a top manager on-site to ensure that the developed concepts are subsequently implemented as solutions.1.

        <p>Along with the barriers preventing SMEs from adopting OI, external conditions must be considered regarding the effect of LOI on collaboration for innovation in SMEs. The compilation of the literature review, the secondary data as well as the interview data with the consultancy intermediary and the network promoters suggest the following regional economic conditions as key factors influencing the scope to diverse actors: the level of urbanization; the geographical distance to larger cities; industry diversity; and the number of research institutions (Doloreux &amp; Dionne, 2008;Freel, 2003;Masiello, Izzo &amp; Canoro, 2015;Shearmur &amp; Doloreux, 2016). Yet, the willingness to participate, and thus the number of participants in problem-solving events, is not affected. Therefore, LOI is also applicable in rural settings. It is rather the type of problem that differs depending on the specific regional conditions. While rural settings with low industry diversity and few research institutions are rather suitable for creative tasks or to promote community involvement in public sector issues, high-tech challenges that require specific skills and knowledge are better suited for research-intensive, urban areas. The types of problems covered in the different LOI events are presented in Table A6 together with a description of the economic profile of the respective region. Further details on network promoters and seeker firms and their sectors and problems are presented in table A7. The summarized findings on key influence factors are represented in Figure 4. Building on these, concrete implementation measures for regional development to establish an innovation ecosystem with LOI are outlined below.Along with the barriers preventing SMEs from adopting OI, external conditions must be considered regarding the effect of LOI on collaboration for innovation in SMEs.

        <p>Resulting from the interview data, the main applications of LOI from the perspective of regional development initiatives are presented in Table 3, together with further details regarding their particular usage patterns. Policymakers can use regional economic development facilitators and consultancy intermediaries to benefit from their experience and network ties to either use or distribute funds for innovation programs to strengthen economic regions or certain industries within a region. Findings suggest that, despite great hesitance to open up, there is a large curiosity for the local OI approach that serves as a basis for SMEs to initially experience the advantages of opening up their organizational boundaries to unobvious others. With the support of regional public institutions, spatial proximity seems to be a major factor for hesitant and inexperienced organizations to try OI methods.Resulting from the interview data, the main applications of LOI from the perspective of regional development initiatives are presented in Table 3, together with further details regarding their particular usage patterns.

        <p>In addition, the observation of three events with LOI-like characteristics indicate that the type of organization the network promoter is associated with and the case-dependent objective of the appointed consultancy intermediary organization both play a central role regarding the outcome of local and offline problem-solving conferences. As outlined above, En Mode Solutions, the consultancy intermediary used as reference point for data access to different LOI events, offer their services not only to municipalities, publicly funded economic development organizations and industrial consortia, but also directly to private companies and associations such as NGOs or conference organizers. Our observations from conferences in the second category indicate that events that are not initiated by regional institutions do not primarily focus on collaboration for innovation with external parties as they do not concentrate on broadcasting problems and attracting unobvious others. They have other objectives that can best be compared to consultancies that help firms solve a specific problem at hand, but in a closed circle of handselected guests, mostly from within the existing, extended network. Large corporations use such a local problem-solving conference to bring different (internal) groups together, in order to communicate key challenges and facilitate internal information flows across departments or stakeholder groups. Another interesting case is when the organizing party assumes a hybrid role as network promoter and consultancy intermediary at the same time. Building on the LOI approach, this case is described by Krätzig, Mennerich and Sick (2018), where a research Figure 4 Framework: LOI for SMEs and Regional Development "We especially wanted this to be the opportunity for various initiatives in our region to find solutions to the problems they were experiencing here, be it in terms of their functioning, in terms of their customers, in terms of their capacity to make their activities profitable, to attract tourists, all that.

        <p>The broadcast search mechanism accounts for the OI-typical interdisciplinary nature of the solver crowd. Co-creation stimulates creativity in the ideation process, and may lead to serendipitous discoveries in the emergence of interdisciplinary project teams. The lean approach involves early prototyping to get first results through experimentation. Support and guidance in the OI process from local network promoters and methodological experts increase willingness to adopt OI. Comparatively low cost for all stakeholder groups in contrast to other OI approaches accounts for lower barriers to participation thanks to the lack of any upfront monetary investments. Connecting various stakeholder groups opens doors to new business and research opportunities and to directly allocate funding in these projects.The broadcast search mechanism accounts for the OI-typical interdisciplinary nature of the solver crowd.

        <p>Small firms, and especially those that are not engaged in radical innovation, tend to be locally embedded (Section 2.3). Hence, new regional development instruments need to meet the current state of the SME in order to facilitate openness for collaboration outside the present network. Further building on localized trust, expanding the network with local industry-, research-and public-sector organizations of different backgrounds (Section 2.2), facilitates accessing external knowledge of unobvious actors by engaging in distant search (Section 2.1), while at the same time establishing a diverse regional innovation ecosystem. Not only seekers, but also problem-solvers, researchers and entrepreneurs, clearly benefit from a local OI approach in terms of interdisciplinary and networking effects, problem clarity through group discussions, as well as collaborative concept development and prototypingproviding them with insights about real industry problems. Direct feedback and a sense of control over potential collaboration intentions lowers frustration, compared to submitting solutions to online platforms where solvers usually have no opportunity to communicate with the seeker in order to establish further business relationships. In addition, learning and interactions among all actors from different sectors in the innovation ecosystem could increase their alignment to favor its economic performance and competitiveness (Edler &amp; Fagerberg, 2017;Fagerberg, 2016;Schot &amp; Steinmueller, 2019). Such cohesion and mobilization among actors could even lead to transformative change to address societal challenges with innovation policies across all governmental departments and agencies.

        <p>As a constant means for regional development connecting industry, research and the public sector, it can be easily coupled with other powerful policy instruments such as identifying projects worthy of receiving R&amp;D funding, which is one of the most efficient policy instruments according to practitioners (Carayannis &amp; Meissner, 2017). However, it is only one facet of the institutional structure of national R&amp;D also composed of scientific and technological resources that are overall predictors of knowledge flows (Azagra-Caro &amp; Consoli, 2016). Public-private cooperation then plays a moderating role in the national context as a catalyst of knowledge flows, while research intermediaries can be seen as knowledge brokers acting as gatekeepers (Mendonca, Pereira &amp; Ferreira, 2018). Innovation policy is therefore required to address actors and their interactions as a whole.As a constant means for regional development connecting industry, research and the public sector, it can be easily coupled with other powerful policy instruments such as identifying projects worthy of receiving R&amp;D funding, which is one of the most efficient policy instruments according to practitioners (Carayannis &amp; Meissner, 2017).

        <p>By investigating collaboration for innovation as a local phenomenon, this study addresses central factors in regional economic development with regard to increasing competitiveness and economic growth in entrepreneurship and small firm development by facilitating access to inter-firm knowledge networks (Section 1 and 2.2). Concrete applications (which are not mutually exclusive) to establish a regional innovation ecosystem with LOI are to: (i) create local networks by uniting multiple stakeholder groups; (ii) identify or create interdisciplinary research projects; (iii) support small regions or single sectors within a region; and (iv) generate stakeholder involvement in public sector issues (Section 4.3). LOI as a local intermediated network approach constitutes a means for regional policy development that overcomes some of the main barriers preventing SMEs from engaging in OI.By investigating collaboration for innovation as a local phenomenon, this study addresses central factors in regional economic development with regard to increasing competitiveness and economic growth in entrepreneurship and small firm development by facilitating access to inter-firm knowledge networks (Section 1 and 2.2).

        <p>While events with LOI-characteristics as well as LOI events initiated by non-public actors also show potential for positively affecting collaboration for innovation in SMEs, our findings suggest that a public actor has the greatest potential to increase the adoption of OI in SMEs.While events with LOI-characteristics as well as LOI events initiated by non-public actors also show potential for positively affecting collaboration for innovation in SMEs, our findings suggest that a public actor has the greatest potential to increase the adoption of OI in SMEs.</p>
        <p>The regional network promoter institutions seem to play a central role in initiating such knowledge exchange and harnessing the potential for resulting local networks by commissioning and accompanying LOI events. Benefitting from public infrastructure and support, this policy means can initiate interactive and integrative community development to democratize innovation in society through co-creation among individuals, firms and public entities. Thus, it can increase collective benefits for the community without controlling or interfering in private sector OI activities (Carayannis &amp; Meissner, 2017). LOI, as an OI-informed means for public policy aimed at the private productive sector, also shows potential to serve as a bridge between open innovation and the growing body of literature on Public Procurement for Innovation (PPI) (for an overview see Obwegeser &amp; Müller, 2018). According to Wesseling and Edquist (2018), PPI is a powerful, underutilized demand-side innovation policy instrument. Not only in the formation of markets for innovation (Bleda &amp; Chicot, 2019), but also specifically targeted at SMEs. Although recent research indicated mixed findings on whether promoting SMEs as suppliers in public procurement would facilitate innovation (Rolfstam, 2018), the new EU Procurement Directives have been revised with the ambition to facilitate in particular the participation of SMEs in public procurement (OJ L, 2014). Nevertheless, resource constraints impede SMEs from accessing innovation procurement contracts, or if they do, overcoming the last step into the commercialization stage. In line with the findings of this study, as a remedy, Saastamoinen, Reijonen and Tammi (2018) find that inter-organizational networks are a means to extend SMEs' resources and thus increase SMEs' innovative performance in public procurement. We suggest using LOI to launch PPI initiatives that focus specifically on integrating SMEs. The LOI approach provides SMEs with the opportunity to work directly on concrete calls while engaging in networking and discussing the potential for resource bundling. PPI phases are supposed to be designed for SMEs as they are aligned with entrepreneurial firm development; yet, for a single small firm, the process still entails obstacles that only a network seems to be able to overcome. Finally, this study contributes to research on the impact of public instruments on the adoption of OI by private productive sector organizations in various industries by providing empirical evidence on the motivations, structures and outcomes of public policy efforts as recently requested in the OI literature (Bogers et al., 2017;Santos &amp; Mendonça, 2017.The regional network promoter institutions seem to play a central role in initiating such knowledge exchange and harnessing the potential for resulting local networks by commissioning and accompanying LOI events.

Hence, LOI enables smaller firms to expand their network and subsequently benefit from resulting network effects both among SMEs as well as between small and large firms, as LOI helps larger firms find suitable partners to outsource core-business-unrelated problem-solving tasks within the local network (Etemad, Wright &amp; Dana, 2001). Although the approach is valuable for organizations of all types and sizes, as it enables them to balance the tradeoff between advantages of a great scope in distant search (regarding knowledge spheres) and advantages of spatial proximity for close collaborations, we focus on SMEs and regional development because of the outstanding opportunities the local approach provides for them.We demonstrate that LOI is a means to helping solution-seeking firms open up their boundaries, to bring them together with problem-solvers from research and industry in local face-to-face problem-solving events, to benefit from networking, collaborative concept development and the exchange of ideas in a trusting environment, while receiving guidance throughout the process by the consultancy intermediary and regional network promoter.

        <p>To reach the aforementioned goal, it is important to reflect that LOI can only succeed as a means for public policy for increasing the adoption of open innovation in regional development when applied as a structured, long-term approach. If it does not become an established process, the break-out of daily routines by connecting with unobvious others and satisfying curiosity about OI only serves as a starting point to open up the innovation process, but may end in the same old inertia effect of sticking with those new partners within a closed network. A profit-driven consultancy intermediary alone will focus its efforts more on providing this promising approach in the form of design-thinking-related consulting services, but in order to keep SMEs open and innovative, our findings indicate that a public actor is needed to establish such a local open innovation process and a growing ecosystem around it.To reach the aforementioned goal, it is important to reflect that LOI can only succeed as a means for public policy for increasing the adoption of open innovation in regional development when applied as a structured, long-term approach.

        <p>Our explorative study opens doors for future research in innovation management, where the present relations will need to be examined with a larger sample to validate the findings on increasing collaboration for SMEs and regional innovation ecosystems through local and offline events promoted by regional public network promoters. Further samples can be collected from OI approaches that share many similarities with LOI, and partially even build upon LOI, as for example OI events initiated by German universities and research centers in order to facilitate university-industry collaborations in the pharmaceutical sector (Krätzig, Mennerich &amp; Sick, 2018). There are also certain international healthcare and programming initiatives, as well as Australian NGO approaches that use the broadcast search mechanism and a local problem-solving conference that could be investigated to further validate and improve the LOI approach.Our explorative study opens doors for future research in innovation management, where the present relations will need to be examined with a larger sample to validate the findings on increasing collaboration for SMEs and regional innovation ecosystems through local and offline events promoted by regional public network promoters.

        <p>To critically examine the central role that our study accredits to the regional network promoter for facilitating the adoption of OI among SMEs, it might be helpful to specifically focus on the aforementioned cases that are not initiated by regional public institutions. Hence, to deepen this explorative line of research and to identify important similarities and differences, we suggest further investigating how the type or organization of the network promoter, as well as the consultancy intermediary, and thus the objectives of such events, affect the adoption of OI in SMEs.To critically examine the central role that our study accredits to the regional network promoter for facilitating the adoption of OI among SMEs, it might be helpful to specifically focus on the aforementioned cases that are not initiated by regional public institutions.

        <p>Our main contribution to existing research is the formulation of a definition of an intermediated network approach and, more importantly, a local concept of open innovation.Our main contribution to existing research is the formulation of a definition of an intermediated network approach and, more importantly, a local concept of open innovation.</p>
        <p>Further research could start building on this definition to overcome the fuzziness regarding the aspect of proximity in OI networks. Finally, this study aims to direct policy makers toward a form of OI that may be more appropriate for regional innovation systems than previous OI concepts. As a means for public policy that is adaptable for a number of different regional considered more important than the final idea generation and solution concretization, in light of the fact that this could be assumed to be a very important aspect for the seekers but to be less interesting for the solvers. An interesting fact regarding the emphasis on the problem discussion is that, according to En Mode Solutions, oftentimes seekers just found their actual problem within this phase, realizing that it was not necessarily the problem that they identified before the conference.Further research could start building on this definition to overcome the fuzziness regarding the aspect of proximity in OI networks.

        <p>Ranging between 94%-100%, the satisfaction with their own participation and networking activities is extraordinarily high. Ranging between 43%-88 %, the expectation of developing business relations with either seeking firms and/or other participants can also be considered very high. 58%-100 % of the participants expressed their unexpected contribution to solving industry problems other than those for which they had come. This illustrates the value of an interdisciplinary approach and serendipity in creative problem-solving processes and in OI in general. Both aspects were deliberately promoted by En Mode Solutions through the various methods that were performed alternately during the conference, thus keeping up a dynamic working atmosphere and establishing unobvious collaborations. The last survey from 2015 aimed to assess the success of the existing local problemsolving approach regarding finding and implementing a suitable solution. It demonstrates in which aspects the existing approach was already of great value to the seekers, but also where obstacles need to be addressed. Table A4 shows that the problems were thematically diverse affecting different parts of the seeker firms. Selection criteria for problem definition include that problems must be within the responsibility of the firm to ensure feasible solutions.Ranging between 94%-100%, the satisfaction with their own participation and networking activities is extraordinarily high.

        <p>Submitted questions such as "How can we stop climate change" were thus not chosen for conferences. From the ten seekers who answered the survey, seven indicated that they found a solution for their problem. One firm did not give an answer to that question but later indicated that it had already implemented the found solution, which raises the number to eight seekers who found a solution. A positive response bias must be considered, however. Although there are considerable shortcomings in the availability of necessary resources in SMEs, four seekers could already implement their solution, three of them within six months after the respective event. Three were still working on the implementation at the time of the survey. Five seekers indicated that they had already spent up to $50,000 (Canadian dollars) on the problem-solving process, whereas three seekers had not yet invested any funds.Submitted questions such as "How can we stop climate change" were thus not chosen for conferences.

        <p>Semi-structured interviews were conducted with two problem solvers, two seekers and the respective network promoter of each of the eight events. Several plausible sample selection criteria were applied: availability of contact data; still being in contact with the intermediary firm; snowball-system (being forwarded from one participant to another); and different firm sizes for seeker and solver organizations. Due to issues of contact data availability or willingness to participate during the timeframe of the study, the final number of completed interviews is 25. The sample can be characterized as follows: Participants from our sample are firmly established in their professional lives, average age around 40, equal number of men and women, can be characterized as upper-middle class, i.e. generally high socio-economic status, high educational background.Semi-structured interviews were conducted with two problem solvers, two seekers and the respective network promoter of each of the eight events.

The answers clearly reflect the value of becoming part of a local network: for seekers mainly due to establishing contacts to experts of distant knowledge spheres who offer new insights regarding the focal problem and possible solutions, and for solvers mainly due to potential business opportunities.Table A1 summarizes the findings from an initial survey that was conducted after the first Seeking Solutions event in 2010, whose results have been presented by Deutsch (2013).
