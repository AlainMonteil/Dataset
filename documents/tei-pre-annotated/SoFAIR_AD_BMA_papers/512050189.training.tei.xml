        <p>The circular economy (CE) emerged as an alternative model to the linear system to foster sustainable development. Entrepreneurship represents a key factor in capturing new circular business opportunities. Research on circular entrepreneurship remains at an early phase and is correspondingly somewhat dispersed. Thus, the research objective here is to bring entrepreneurship into the focus of discussions on CE through a systematic literature review. In the absence of any systematic review on this theme, this work aims to map the relevant research and identify the themes discussed in the literature straddling entrepreneurship and the CE currently dispersed across the existing literature. Based on a sample of 102 articles collected from the Scopus and Web of Science databases, this approach identified four thematic groups: growing circular SMEs, born circular firms and start-ups, social entrepreneurship in CE, and support ecosystem for circular entrepreneurship. A greater emphasis on the study of growing circular SMEs to the detriment of other groups is observed. Also, research in the field is mainly focused on European countries. We then propose a future research agenda and a conceptual model for the entrepreneurial process in CE as a point of departure for further developing and deepening the literature on circular entrepreneurship.The circular economy (CE) emerged as an alternative model to the linear system to foster sustainable development.

        <p>The concept of sustainable development arose from the discussions following the publication of the Brundtland report in 1987. This defined the concept as development that considers the present without compromising the capacity of future generations to meet their own needs (Brundtland, 1987). Henceforth, a series of sustainable development based initiatives have taken place. The most recent involved the definition of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for Agenda 2030, based on balancing the three dimensions to sustainable development: economic, social, and environmental (United Nations, 2015).The concept of sustainable development arose from the discussions following the publication of the Brundtland report in 1987.

        <p>Within the sustainability paradigm, the circular economy (CE) holds an important and relevant role (Geissdoerfer et al., 2017) and represents an alternative to the linear economic system based on "take-make-dispose" characterised by the primacy attributed to economic objectives with only very low relevance awarded to ecological and social concerns (Sauvé et al., 2016). The CE holds the objective of maintaining products, components, and materials at the highest level of utility and value over time through slowing, closing, and narrowing production cycles (Bocken et al., 2016). The CE enables the Abbreviations: CBM, circular business model; CE, circular economy; CSR, corporate social responsibility; EMM, environmental management maturity; MCDM, multicriterion decisionmaking; PEERD, public environmental and energy research and development; RCC, resources, competences and capabilities; SCRM, supply chain relationship management; SDG, sustainable development goals; SME, small and medium sized enterprises; SSCD, sustainable supply chain design; TPB, theory of planned behaviour; WEEE, waste from electrical and electronic equipment; WEFW, water, energy, food and waste; WMC, wood-frame multistorey construction; WoS, web of science. establishment of a basis for conciliating the problem of enhancing productivity while considering the externalities to production processes, the consumption of products and the impacts of the end of their useful lifespan. Therefore, the CE becomes a means by which companies may operationally implement sustainable development (Geissdoerfer et al., 2017;Sauvé et al., 2016).Within the sustainability paradigm, the circular economy (CE) holds an important and relevant role (Geissdoerfer et al., 2017) and represents an alternative to the linear economic system based on "take-make-dispose" characterised by the primacy attributed to economic objectives with only very low relevance awarded to ecological and social concerns (Sauvé et al., 2016).

        <p>The transition to a CE means a systemic change that aims to reduce the impacts of the linear economy and construct long-term resilience and establish economic and business opportunities in addition to returning environmental and social benefits (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2015). In CE, one of the main goals is to transform waste into a resource. In this sense, waste management emerges as a relevant CE subsector (Merli et al., 2018). New smart technologies are required to promote efficient waste management as a basis for CE (Dantas et al., 2021).The transition to a CE means a systemic change that aims to reduce the impacts of the linear economy and construct long-term resilience and establish economic and business opportunities in addition to returning environmental and social benefits (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2015).

        <p>Hence, the CE represents an economic system that encapsulates a change in paradigm in the ways that human society interrelates with nature within the scope of preventing the depletion of resources, closing energy and material cycles, and facilitating sustainable development through implementation across the micro (companies and consumers), meso (economic actors acting through symbiotic integration) and macro (cities, regions, governments) levels (Prieto-Sandoval, Jaca, &amp; Ormazabal, 2018). From a micro perspective, companies are crucial to any transition to a CE in keeping with how they hold the responsibility and implement innovative strategies to plan for waste, reutilising materials and products, and influencing consumer awareness and demand for green products (Veleva &amp; Bodkin, 2018).Hence, the CE represents an economic system that encapsulates a change in paradigm in the ways that human society interrelates with nature within the scope of preventing the depletion of resources, closing energy and material cycles, and facilitating sustainable development through implementation across the micro (companies and consumers), meso (economic actors acting through symbiotic integration) and macro (cities, regions, governments) levels (Prieto-Sandoval, Jaca, &amp; Ormazabal, 2018).

        <p>Research within CE scope has received increasing attention from scholars, as evidenced by reviews addressing different perspectives in recent years. These reviews comprise studies analysing CE and issues as CE concept (Homrich et al., 2018;Kirchherr et al., 2017;Prieto-Sandoval, Jaca, &amp; Ormazabal, 2018), business models (Centobelli et al., 2021;Hina et al., 2021;Pieroni et al., 2019a), innovation (de Jesus et al., 2019;de Jesus &amp; Mendonça, 2018;Suchek et al., 2021), industry 4.0 (Agrawal et al., 2021;Awan et al., 2021;Dantas et al., 2021;Rosa et al., 2020), supply chains (MahmoumGonbadi et al., 2021;Masi et al., 2017), and others. However, Hofstetter et al. (2021) noted that CE research is still fragmented, and a particular challenge in researching CE from a business or economic perspective is that circular economies are largely nonexistent, although there are examples of regional industrial symbiosis or internal company configurations. Thus, issues such as the complex articulation of global value chains, the dominant linear logic that continues to display institutional capture, and the inclusion of the Global South in North-dominated circular economies are issues that require scholars attention to achieve an accurate circular economic model (Hofstetter et al., 2021).Research within CE scope has received increasing attention from scholars, as evidenced by reviews addressing different perspectives in recent years.

        <p>In the literature, the studies on circular business models (CBM) primarily focus on established companies and large corporations due to their high profile and influence over their respective markets (Henry et al., 2020). Despite this, the business models of incumbents and start-ups are different; while the former can influence the ecosystem in which they are embedded towards CE, can also be less flexible than start-ups in capturing opportunities and developing radical innovations (Suchek et al., 2021).In the literature, the studies on circular business models (CBM) primarily focus on established companies and large corporations due to their high profile and influence over their respective markets (Henry et al., 2020).

        <p>Entrepreneurs represent individuals with the function of identifying and leveraging new opportunities through staging new combinations, resulting in new products, methods of production, sources of raw materials and markets, as well as new forms of organisations (Schumpeter, 1934). Considering how entrepreneurship derives from the willingness to assume risks when faced with uncertainty, the entrepreneur is the individual that accepts challenges with confidence in their own judgements over committing financial resources that they may end up losing (Knight, 1921). As uncertainties surround environmental questions, they pose major opportunities for entrepreneurial activities. Entrepreneurial actions may offset environmental market failures by discovering, evaluating and exploiting the opportunities encapsulated by these failures to drive the more efficient utilisation of environmental and natural resources and bring about the development of an ecologically sustainable economy (Dean &amp; McMullen, 2007). Furthermore, sustainable entrepreneurs are also capable of advocating changes in the institutional structures that thereby enable the exploitation of sustainable opportunities, improving the competitiveness of sustainable behaviours and paving the way for new entrepreneurial attitudes (Pacheco et al., 2010).Entrepreneurs represent individuals with the function of identifying and leveraging new opportunities through staging new combinations, resulting in new products, methods of production, sources of raw materials and markets, as well as new forms of organisations (Schumpeter, 1934).

        <p>Furthermore, entrepreneurs are also able to foster transformations in the social dimension. Social entrepreneurs target opportunities within the scope of boosting social wealth through establishing new ventures or innovatively managing existing organisations (Zahra et al., 2009). They thus represent a means of overcoming marketbased mechanisms for profit-making organisations and promoting the reinvestment of their positive results in the respective communities, groups, and stakeholders (Phillips et al., 2015). Sustainable entrepreneurship, therefore, interconnects with business, creative processes and wellbeing across the social, economic, and environmental dimensions (Crecente, Sarabia, &amp; Del Val, 2021).Furthermore, entrepreneurs are also able to foster transformations in the social dimension.

        <p>However, sustainable entrepreneurs encounter difficulties in bringing about changes in the market on their own account and, to this end, require the support of government and other stakeholders to bring about better mediation, more ambitious political policies, infrastructures and new social norms for nurturing more sustainable lives (Veleva, 2021).However, sustainable entrepreneurs encounter difficulties in bringing about changes in the market on their own account and, to this end, require the support of government and other stakeholders to bring about better mediation, more ambitious political policies, infrastructures and new social norms for nurturing more sustainable lives (Veleva, 2021).</p>
        <p>Circular entrepreneurship, in turn, is defined as the process of exploration and exploitation opportunities in the CE domain (Zucchella &amp; Urban, 2019). In this sense, as CE is considered a strategy to achieve sustainability outcomes (Geissdoerfer et al., 2020), circular entrepreneurship is a form of sustainable entrepreneurship. Crecente, Sarabia, and Del Val (2021) argue that circular entrepreneurship is one of the emerging forms of sustainable entrepreneurship that aims to care for and protect people and their environments. According to the authors, entrepreneurship interrelates with other forms of entrepreneurship, especially organic entrepreneurship (focusing on health and well-being), green entrepreneurship (focusing on climate and ecosystems), and blue entrepreneurship (focusing on clean water and marine life).Circular entrepreneurship, in turn, is defined as the process of exploration and exploitation opportunities in the CE domain (Zucchella &amp; Urban, 2019).

        <p>Circular entrepreneurship can be represented by born-circular companies, consisting of young ventures created to deliver circular value propositions and explore CE opportunities (Zucchella &amp; Urban, 2019). New circular businesses contribute to solutions to environmental problems by creating new environmentally sustainable products, services, and institutions through actions that pose higher risks to incumbents (York &amp; Venkataraman, 2010). Given their newcomer status, such ventures are more credible when they claim to be part of the solution rather than the problems caused by incumbent firms (Hockerts &amp; Wüstenhagen, 2010).Circular entrepreneurship can be represented by born-circular companies, consisting of young ventures created to deliver circular value propositions and explore CE opportunities (Zucchella &amp; Urban, 2019).

        <p>At the same time, circular entrepreneurship can be represented by growing circular enterprises, namely, established companies that are transitioning to less impactful activities and adopting circularity principles (Zucchella &amp; Urban, 2019). In this sense, SMEs can observe business opportunities in CE, such as niche opportunities with customers predisposed to sustainable consumption (Linder &amp; Williander, 2017;Šebestová &amp; Sroka, 2020), increased prestige, reduced costs and financial profitability, restoration of the local environment or the sustainability of the company (Ormazabal et al., 2018;Rizos et al., 2016) and contribute to the transition to CE by opting for CE principles. Importantly, opportunities are observed for entrepreneurial companies with innovative business models to fill the gap and provide critical linkages for corporations in reverse supply chains while creating new business opportunities with social benefits (Veleva &amp; Bodkin, 2018).At the same time, circular entrepreneurship can be represented by growing circular enterprises, namely, established companies that are transitioning to less impactful activities and adopting circularity principles (Zucchella &amp; Urban, 2019).

        <p>While sustainable development focused entrepreneurship has received considerable discussion over the last decade, the literature still requires further development (Filser et al., 2019). The case of CE entrepreneurship is no different, and the study of the role of entrepreneurship in the transition process towards establishing a CE is recent and remains at an early phase (Heshmati, 2017).While sustainable development focused entrepreneurship has received considerable discussion over the last decade, the literature still requires further development (Filser et al., 2019).

        <p>Most of the published studies seem to focus on implementing CE by SMEs (Demirel &amp; Danisman, 2019;Linder &amp; Williander, 2017;Rizos et al., 2016;Sawe et al., 2021;Zamfir et al., 2017). For example, Prieto-Sandoval, Ormazabal, et al. (2018) identified the key elements in assessing CE implementation in SMEs, namely, CE fields of action (take, make, distribute, use, and recover), industrial symbiosis and environmental certifications. Some authors have explored the implementation of CE in SMEs in different contexts, such as in Spain (Ormazabal et al., 2016(Ormazabal et al., , 2018;;Prieto-Sandoval et al., 2019), the United Kingdom (Dey et al., 2020), Italy (Mura et al., 2020), Germany (Schmidt et al., 2021), Austria (Holzer et al., 2021), and India (Sharma et al., 2021). On the other hand, there is a lack of studies about borncircular firms (Cullen &amp; De Angelis, 2021;Henry et al., 2020;Hull et al., 2021;Millette et al., 2020;Rok &amp; Kulik, 2021) and very little is known about designing and implementing CBM from scratch. This may indicate a focus on incremental innovations rather than more radical innovations.Most of the published studies seem to focus on implementing CE by SMEs (Demirel &amp; Danisman, 2019;Linder &amp; Williander, 2017;Rizos et al., 2016;Sawe et al., 2021;Zamfir et al., 2017).

        <p>Studies on this issue confirm that entrepreneurs can introduce business models, innovative products and services, explore the opportunities deriving from the CE and resolve issues around the social and environmental spheres (Veleva &amp; Bodkin, 2018). In this perspective, there remains much to be done in entrepreneurship research ranging In this sense, our study adds to the field by providing a theoretical background around entrepreneurship in CE. Furthermore, our study presents itself as a reference point for entrepreneurs aiming to implement CBMs and policy-makers who aim to develop the conditions for entrepreneurship in CE.Studies on this issue confirm that entrepreneurs can introduce business models, innovative products and services, explore the opportunities deriving from the CE and resolve issues around the social and environmental spheres (Veleva &amp; Bodkin, 2018).

        <p>Intending to systematise the literature, identify research paths and present the emerging aspects interrelating entrepreneurship and the CE, the articles incorporated into this SLR derive from the Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases. We used two databases to cover most articles. We have chosen to use WoS and Scopus since they are well-established bibliographic databases (Paul &amp; Criado, 2020). The research in these databases was made in September 2021 using de following: "circular econom*" OR "circularit*" or "closed-loop*" AND "entrepreneur*" OR "start-up*" OR "startup*" OR "start up*" OR "new venture*" OR "new enterprise*" OR "new business*" OR "new compan*" OR "small enterprise*" OR "small business*" OR "small venture*" OR "small compan*" OR "SME*" within the topics in the case of the WoS and in the titles, abstracts and keywords in the case of Scopus. We followed the recommendation of Kraus et al. (2020) for entrepreneurship literature reviews, and we have conducted the search via online databases and for journal articles only. In this sense, we aimed to ensure the highest standards of transparency. The filter applied to article selection stipulated only English language articles with no further filter on the research field to identify publications and capture all of the articles of relevance to the research. However, this decision may have held consequences for the number of articles subsequently excluded from the final set of publications following the screening and eligibility phases.Intending to systematise the literature, identify research paths and present the emerging aspects interrelating entrepreneurship and the CE, the articles incorporated into this SLR derive from the Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases.

        <p>This group is composed of studies that explore the factors influencing SMEs decision to CE implementation, including motivations, obstacles and enablers for these firms. The principal factors can be highlighted from the studies. In the first place, different motivations are observed for implementing CE. Financial attractiveness and external recognition are benefits targeted by SMEs (Rizos et al., 2016). In the beer and mushroom sectors, the motivations for industrial symbiosis highlight the focus on economic and environmental gains and observed market opportunities (Patricio et al., 2018). Czech entrepreneurs are motivated to implement sustainable solutions mainly when they are involved in export activities or when they are at the beginning of their activities because this is what their customers desire (Šebestová &amp; Sroka, 2020). In the case of a Brazilian born-sustainable in the fashion sector, the search for innovative sustainable practices was noted as the main driver of CE implementation (Ostermann et al., 2021). Holzer et al. (2021) found that the key factors for Austrian SMEs are sustainability, resource efficiency, and differentiation. A gap is noticed between perceived importance and performance when acquiring more efficient resources and processes becomes an opportunity. Singh et al. (2018) added the environmental commitment and green economic incentives to the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) model to study the CE readiness of Indian SMEs. The results confirm the influence of both the environmental commitment and green economic incentives. Also, attitude is a dominant component influencing the readiness to CE. Social pressure also influences CE readiness, while perceived behaviour control, which represents technological, financial, infrastructure and human barriers, has a negative impact on environmental commitment. Both environmental commitment and green economic incentives influence supply chain relationship management (SCRM) and sustainable supply chain design (SSCD), which in turn are key factors to improving SMEs' CE capabilities (Centobelli et al., 2021).This group is composed of studies that explore the factors influencing SMEs decision to CE implementation, including motivations, obstacles and enablers for these firms.

        <p>Both internal and external factors can influence SMEs when implementing CE practices. From an intern perspective, the lack of capital for investments in CE is a barrier observed (Caldera et al., 2019;Rizos et al., 2016). In some cases, it is highlighted the high start-up costs (Jaeger &amp; Upadhyay, 2020) and high costs to implement remanufacturing (Pla-Julián &amp; Guevara, 2019;Sharma et al., 2021). Ghisetti and Montresor (2020) observed that financial-as-usual fundraising patterns enable the implementation of CE practices. Selffinance is the most important source, followed by public financing and debt financing. It also highlights the role of support from policymakers to enable CE implementation.Both internal and external factors can influence SMEs when implementing CE practices.

        <p>Administrative burdens are also a challenge observed by SMEs (Rizos et al., 2016). Implementing CE requires time and knowledge, and the studies report the lack of these two factors as barriers observed by SMEs (Caldera et al., 2019;Patricio et al., 2018). The lack of technical skills and information on product design and production are also reported (Jaeger &amp; Upadhyay, 2020).Administrative burdens are also a challenge observed by SMEs (Rizos et al., 2016).

The lack of technical skills and information on product design and production are also reported (Jaeger &amp; Upadhyay, 2020).</p>
        <p>In this sense, an environmental culture and leadership commitment to implementing CE become fundamental to address these challenges (Rizos et al., 2016;Torres-Guevara et al., 2021). Sharma et al. (2021) noted that strong "management will" is one of the major prerequisites to CE implementation in Indian SMEs. Other prerequisites referred to employee training, motivation, and appropriate guidelines (Sharma et al., 2021). Ünal, Urbinati, Chiaroni, and Manzini (2019) argue that the contextual factors, both internal (strategic orientation, industrial capabilities, learning and training mechanisms, company size and age) and external (local and cultural settings, regulatory framework, level of market competition) determine the nature of value creation in CBMs by characterising the bundles of managerial practices to be implemented.In this sense, an environmental culture and leadership commitment to implementing CE become fundamental to address these challenges (Rizos et al., 2016;Torres-Guevara et al., 2021).

        <p>In relation to the company's external context, issues related to the supply chain, market, and governmental support are highlighted.In relation to the company's external context, issues related to the supply chain, market, and governmental support are highlighted.</p>
        <p>Depending on the position in the supply chain, CE opportunities were more or less evident, and the need to think about the relationship with stakeholders had different dimensions (Pla-Julián &amp; Guevara, 2019). CE practices in the design, manufacturing and distribution stages are mainly observed in companies at the beginning of the value chain. Because they depend on their customers' needs, companies that lack design power do not have as many opportunities and can try to generate value from waste instead of paying for disposal, changing energy sources and looking for positive ways to impact the environment (Pla-Julián &amp; Guevara, 2019). Different barriers are also seen for different CE practices, while companies that undertake disruptive innovation, redesigning products and services to minimise the use of materials, are more likely to perceive more barriers than companies that implement activities such as waste minimisation, replanning energy use, and using renewable energy, which only perceives barriers related to administrative and regulatory procedures (García-Quevedo et al., 2020).Depending on the position in the supply chain, CE opportunities were more or less evident, and the need to think about the relationship with stakeholders had different dimensions (Pla-Julián &amp; Guevara, 2019).

        <p>In terms of supply, obstacles are observed regarding inputs required for the CBM (Marino &amp; Pariso, 2021;Ostermann et al., 2021;Rizos et al., 2016). In terms of demand, specifically convincing costumers of the potentials of CE and that recycled products have no inferior quality (Rizos et al., 2016) and selling circular products in the fashion sector, due to the fast fashion trend, are challenges (Ostermann et al., 2021).In terms of supply, obstacles are observed regarding inputs required for the CBM (Marino &amp; Pariso, 2021;Ostermann et al., 2021;Rizos et al., 2016).

        <p>Governmental support, in turn, is pointed out in most of the studies. Challenges include lack of legislation and support from local authorities, difficulty getting clearance for new raw material production, and quality certification, among others (Marino &amp; Pariso, 2021;Rizos et al., 2016). From the study of European SMEs, it was found that the main decision factor in practising CE is the country in which they are located, highlighting the importance of factors such as economic development, national programmes, financing mechanisms, the institutional framework, and incentives (Zamfir et al., 2017). Regulatory barriers, namely, the cost of complying with regulations and the existence of complex administrative and legal procedures, are the main obstacle for European SMEs (García-Quevedo et al., 2020;Ghent ¸a &amp; Matei, 2018).Governmental support, in turn, is pointed out in most of the studies.

        <p>In this sense, interaction with other ecosystem actors is fundamental to CE implementation in SMEs. While the lack of supporting reference points and challenging B2B cooperation (Jaeger &amp; Upadhyay, 2020;Rizos et al., 2016) may be barriers, networks are considered a valuable information source (Ostermann et al., 2021), and the existence of a fertile ecosystem, CE intermediaries for the implementation process, and stakeholder engagement may act as drivers for CE implementation in SMEs (Caldera et al., 2019;Torres-Guevara et al., 2021). In the case of potentials for industrial symbiosis in SMEs, three groups of problems were identified; namely, organisational management, related to low IT assistance and lack of data reliability; waste management, related to the weak CE waste policy and poor waste-to-resource strategies; and resource management, related to low coordination and high centralisation of resources (Rinc on-Moreno et al., 2020).In this sense, interaction with other ecosystem actors is fundamental to CE implementation in SMEs.

        <p>In rural SMEs, both in the manufacturing and agriculture sectors, According to Daddi et al. (2019), actions primarily aimed at promoting environmental engagement in EC, such as environmental certifications, are considered proactive strategies to deal with paradoxical tensions faced by SMEs, that is, use of recycled inputs and the consequent potential loss of competitiveness by using recycled materials in specific products, which consumers may perceive as of inferior quality. On the other hand, actions aimed at reducing the "negative" sign of the economic pillar of corporate sustainability, that is, increasing the firm's competitiveness, are considered defensive strategies.In rural SMEs, both in the manufacturing and agriculture sectors, According to Daddi et al.

        <p>Studies also indicate the CBM experimentation as a fundamental capability for sustainable transformations in business (Bocken et al., 2018;Konietzko et al., 2020), also highlighting that collaboration with external partners can ease this process. Konietzko In this sense, the relationship between the manager's interpretation of circularity as an opportunity, the manager's holistic thinking, circular network interactions and the integration of circularity in a company's strategy was analysed by Eikelenboom and de Jong (2021).Studies also indicate the CBM experimentation as a fundamental capability for sustainable transformations in business (Bocken et al., 2018;Konietzko et al., 2020), also highlighting that collaboration with external partners can ease this process.

        <p>The results point to the essential role for managers encouraging the development of circular network interactions, while the manager's level of holistic thinking may be a supporting factor in this process. It is also noted that collaboration with customers improves the impact of the internal environmental management and eco-design on economic and environmental performances. In contrast, collaboration with the supplier through green purchasing can only improve the effect of eco-design on environmental performance (Susanty et al., 2020). Other authors also analysed the alignment of CE principles in agriculture. In the Tuscany Region, the compatibilities between wineproduction entrepreneurial strategies and the principles of CE were studied (Borrelli, 2018). Entrepreneurs try to create synergies with the landscape, are concerned with heredity and biodiversity, and get closer to organic production. They are also concerned with energy efficiency and installing PV and wind farms. Zhu et al. (2019) also show that environmental, economic and social objectives can be achieved by implementing circular agriculture. The study analysed a pig breeding farm case that has searched for alternatives for byproducts. Although the project started as a government initiative through financial incentives, it requires the ability of the entrepreneur to provide economic viability. A production pattern is also required for the economic viability of the project. Some farmers opt for an adaptative approach, relying first and foremost on technological solutions to address circular challenges. Other farmers adopt an alternative approach, stating that making a profit, whatever the costs, and growing production, whatever the inputs required, is no longer indisputable (Dagevos &amp; Lauwere, 2021).The results point to the essential role for managers encouraging the development of circular network interactions, while the manager's level of holistic thinking may be a supporting factor in this process.

        <p>Studies also investigate the implementation of CBM based in a product-service system (i.e., it involves the producer retaining ownership of the product after-sale and during use) in SMEs. Linder and Williander (2017) observed that several hitherto described challenges of CBM can at least sometimes be overcome in practice (including channel resilience, ensuring return flow and likely fashion vulnerability and operational risk), but validating a CBM also takes longer than the corresponding linear business model. Pieroni et al. (2019b) similarly found that the new capabilities required by these solutions would be realistic to achieve, despite already challenging for their context. The implementation of this type of CBM can also influence internal To explain internal differences in countries at the firm level, factors such as size, total turnover, percentage of turnover dedicated to R&amp;D and type of activity are observed (Bassi &amp; Dias, 2019). Microfirms are the least involved in CE practices. Particular involvement with waste minimisation and resource use optimisation is related to small firms, and medium-sized firms reflect ongoing CE activities or full involvement (Katz-Gerro &amp; L opez Sintas, 2019). According to Bassi and Dias (2020), four classes of SMEs are observed: companies with no interest in CE; companies in the process of introducing CE, which is the smallest group; firms interested in specific CE practices only (e.g., minimising waste and redesigning products to use recycled materials), which is the largest group; and firms with a very positive attitude towards the green economy that already implement the CE practices analysed. Waste minimisation is the most likely practice to be adopted, followed, in descending order, by energy use replanning, product and service eco-design, and finally renewable energy use and water use replanning (Katz-Gerro &amp; L opez Sintas, 2019).Studies also investigate the implementation of CBM based in a product-service system (i.e., it involves the producer retaining ownership of the product after-sale and during use) in SMEs.

        <p>When addressing the level of implementation of CE in SMEs, naturally, these studies are based on quantitative methodological approaches. Dey et al. (2020) and Mura et al. (2020) further employ mixed approaches, incorporating components of qualitative analysis.When addressing the level of implementation of CE in SMEs, naturally, these studies are based on quantitative methodological approaches.

        <p>These studies are focused only on the European context and analyse the level of implementation of CE in SMEs based on different dimensions (e.g., take, make, distribute, use, and recover; Dey et al., 2020;Ormazabal et al., 2018), and replanning of water, replanning energy use, renewable energy use, minimising waste and redesigning products and services (Bassi &amp; Dias, 2019, 2020;Demirel &amp; Danisman, 2019;Katz-Gerro &amp; L opez Sintas, 2019).These studies are focused only on the European context and analyse the level of implementation of CE in SMEs based on different dimensions (e.g., take, make, distribute, use, and recover; Dey et al., 2020;Ormazabal et al., 2018), and replanning of water, replanning energy use, renewable energy use, minimising waste and redesigning products and services (Bassi &amp; Dias, 2019, 2020;Demirel &amp; Danisman, 2019;Katz-Gerro &amp; L opez Sintas, 2019).</p>
        <p>The last subgroup studying growing circular SMEs includes four studies focused on tools and methodologies to help SMEs transition to CE. Pigosso et al. (2018) The challenges encountered in CBMs of start-ups may include factors such as the unprepared market for a particularly sustainable product or service, problems with escalation activities and the potential source of mission deviation in the process of business expansion, raw material variability and product volatility given informal contracts and ad-hoc arrangements with suppliers (Cullen &amp; De Angelis, 2021;Rok &amp; Kulik, 2021). Kahupi et al. (2021) report how investors are more doubtful about sustainability-based innovations due to their costs, the returns and risks associated with investments, which ends up hindering the financing of new sustainable businesses. Furthermore, consumers emerge as increasingly receptive to this type of innovation.The last subgroup studying growing circular SMEs includes four studies focused on tools and methodologies to help SMEs transition to CE.

        <p>Therefore, sustainable entrepreneurs should certify their business plans can produce the products and services able to attract investors and, to this end, may also count on support from incubators. Furthermore, Guldmann and Huulgaard (2020) suggest that the divergences found within circular start-ups for CBM innovation go beyond size, industry and segment, and may be related to factors such as the level of ambition for the business model innovation process, the internal configurations of the company, the level of management attention, the available resources, which internal and external stakeholders were involved in the process, and their attitudes towards the CBM. From the study of a born-circular, Ünal, Urbinati, and Chiaroni (2019) highlight the importance of managerial commitment as a key moderating factor between the value network and the costumer value proposition and interface dimensions. These dimensions should interact, through managerial commitment, to allow the transfer of value from producer to customer. De Angelis and Feola (2020) presented the case of an academic spin-off, which is based on a CBM that capture value from the combination of reduced expenditure, use of secondary raw materials, recovered resources and low transportation costs, and the existence of a premium price and potential additional revenues arising from a new product line.Therefore, sustainable entrepreneurs should certify their business plans can produce the products and services able to attract investors and, to this end, may also count on support from incubators.

        <p>In this group, studies are dedicated to understanding the role and characteristics of social entrepreneurs working in the CE. Even while poorly explored in the literature, social entrepreneurship represents a potential influence over introducing sustainable and innovative business models (Dentchev et al., 2018). Social entrepreneurs maintain their place in the chain of value to support movements within the direction of a CE even if, in the meanwhile, there is a lack of visibility among these entrepreneurs as regards other stakeholders in the ecosystem (Staicu &amp; Pop, 2018). These social entrepreneurs attain greater renown for their products, based upon validation by consumers, and for their social causes.In this group, studies are dedicated to understanding the role and characteristics of social entrepreneurs working in the CE.

        <p>By optimising the ecological and social well-being dimensions, ethical entrepreneurship incorporates CE practices. From the social perspective, especially in agriculture, demarginalisation and motivation are crucial, rendering the ecological production of vegetable produce viable, while in ecological terms, the focus is on the gradual regeneration of the soil while maximising production (Reckinger, 2018).By optimising the ecological and social well-being dimensions, ethical entrepreneurship incorporates CE practices.

        <p>Social entrepreneurship can foster positive social impacts through raising income and working opportunities for marginalised groups, with training and the development of skills in local communities coupled with the potential empowerment of women and improvements in terms of gender equality. Environmental benefits may arise from transforming materials, which would otherwise have been disposed of in a landfill, dumped on wasteland or burned, into products with aggregate value as observed in social companies with recycling-based activities in Sri Lanka (Conlon et al., 2019). From the economic point of view, the incentive for the development of local businesses, the reduction of costs to the community, the increase in purchasing power and the creation of innovative chains of value all help drive greater economic activities at the local level (Conlon et al., 2019). 2020) highlight how social entrepreneurs in the textile sector need to pay attention when choosing convivial technologies, focusing on more user-friendly technologies to ensure the appropriate scale of productions while simultaneously nurturing accessibility and adaptability. Other challenges also arise from this social dimension, including the management of fair practices for staff members, facilitating transparent governance processes and empowering co-producers, users and consumers in sustainable behaviours. As regards the interaction with the regional metabolism, its business models remain capped by the existing local political structures and with these initiatives involving, in addition to their own "project perimeters," through different regional groups, networks of interested parties and intermediaries specialising in textiles. This group highlights that social entrepreneurs are able to embrace CE principles, especially collaborating for positive social outcomes. Again, qualitative methods predominate among the studies, which investigate the textile, agriculture and water supply sectors, except two conceptual studies (Dentchev et al., 2018;Smitskikh et al., 2020).Social entrepreneurship can foster positive social impacts through raising income and working opportunities for marginalised groups, with training and the development of skills in local communities coupled with the potential empowerment of women and improvements in terms of gender equality.

As regards the interaction with the regional metabolism, its business models remain capped by the existing local political structures and with these initiatives involving, in addition to their own "project perimeters," through different regional groups, networks of interested parties and intermediaries specialising in textiles. This group highlights that social entrepreneurs are able to embrace CE principles, especially collaborating for positive social outcomes. Again, qualitative methods predominate among the studies, which investigate the textile, agriculture and water supply sectors, except two conceptual studies (Dentchev et al., 2018;Smitskikh et al., 2020).</p>

        <p>Studies in this group analyse the interaction between firms and other ecosystem actors as a fundamental path to fostering CE. Regarding collaboration between firms, Veleva and Bodkin (2018) explore the collaborations between entrepreneurs and corporations to advance with the CE, finding that corporations hold the motivation to collaborate with entrepreneurs over their sustainability commitments, where state or European Union mandated opportunities to cut costs and gain reputation and other benefits. Corporations and other large organisations become the suppliers for entrepreneurs to the extent that the latter handle significant quantities of expired stock, packaging and waste. Entrepreneurs may take advantage of technology and strategic partnerships with large corporations to create value for their partners and communities, reducing risks and costs and improving the reputation of the company and its social impacts. The geographic proximity of the actors facilitates the establishment of mutual circularity among participants, as observed in a network of Brazilian businesses made up of small companies, individual entrepreneurs and farmers forming a cooperative regime (Silva et al., 2019).Studies in this group analyse the interaction between firms and other ecosystem actors as a fundamental path to fostering CE.

        <p>The digital platforms, in turn, as observed by Del Vecchio et al. ( 2021) in an Italian case study, enable the highlighting of opportunities and inter-sectorial challenges through means of providing a meeting point where interested parties may share their solutions and work in conjunction in specific challenges, interconnecting existing initiatives and supporting the CE at the national, regional and local levels. Hence, such platforms hold an influence on establishing CE focused ecosystems of innovation.The digital platforms, in turn, as observed by Del Vecchio et al.

        <p>From another perspective, Cramer (2020) addressed the role of transition brokers as intermediaries in the regional governance in implementing CE. In that case, the intermediary becomes the person or organisation that develops proper interfaces between the triple-helix actors (business, research, and government). They facilitate both the transition process (learning, communication) and content (feeding new information and seeking ambitious solutions). Regarding the universities' role, Poponi et al. (2020) explore the potential of academic spinoffs as drivers for the CE and find that these may be an alternative tool for fostering the transfer of technology and/or knowledge to the commercial and productive sector and nurturing the circular process. Sukiennik et al. (2021) presented the results of the Limbra Project, focused on strengthening entrepreneurship in Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic, in line with the recommendations of the "Green action plan for SMEs" in a way to meet the requirements of the CE. Findings highlight the role of universities in raising awareness of the participants and leading to building a permanent pro-environmental attitude and to supporting the raw material market in Poland.From another perspective, Cramer (2020) addressed the role of transition brokers as intermediaries in the regional governance in implementing CE.

        <p>The importance of clusters is also studied (Razminiene, 2019;Refsgaard et al., 2021). Examples of high levels of cooperation between diverse actors arise in Nordic countries. Countries such as Iceland, Denmark, and Sweden convey the importance of regional and local levels in establishing new institutional structures for cooperation between companies and public authorities capable of paving the way to synergetic clusters that foster the founding of new companies, and new jobs while also nurturing sustainable development. One such cluster in Denmark displays how its success is related to the human factor, a history of trust and entrepreneurial trial and error (Refsgaard et al., 2021).The importance of clusters is also studied (Razminiene, 2019;Refsgaard et al., 2021).

        <p>This group is composed of studies that analyse the effects of regional governance and determinants in CE establishment, focusing especially on the importance of governmental support. Some authors study the emergence of CE related sectors. Lazarevic et al. (2020) argue that the wood-frame multistorey construction (WMC) in Finland, as an alternative for the established construction sector, has been driven by governmental programmes that have set targets and guided the direction of search. The study highlights the importance of creative destruction as a motor for innovation in science and technology and the role of government in stimulating this process. On the other hand, it is observed that entrepreneurs of the Water, Energy, Food and Waste (WEFW) sector in Romania cannot fully capture market opportunities due to the lack of a coherent legislative framework (Petrariu et al., 2021). The lack of efficient policies is that decision-makers do not completely understand the interconnectedness and transdisciplinary factors in WEFW sectors. In the case of Taiwan's recycling sector, Wu et al. (2021) argue that institutional governance, in the form of efforts of various levels of government to initiate and organise events and networking activities and to facilitate dialogue among stakeholders, was an essential factor for the successful establishment of an industrial-level CE. Under this framework, entrepreneurs have identified, selected, and acquired usable materials and connected and recombined them into fit resources through collective bricolage. The institutional governance approach has led to the emergence of a lively ecosystem of institutional entrepreneurship in Taiwan. This furthermore questions government participation in CE incubators in this particular context, probably due to the lack of trust in the government, a frequent factor faced by developing countries (Hull et al., 2021).This group is composed of studies that analyse the effects of regional governance and determinants in CE establishment, focusing especially on the importance of governmental support.

        <p>Technology and industry 4.0 In this group, the studies investigate issues associated with technology and industry 4.0 for entrepreneurship in CE. Specifically, the authors explored the adoption of 3D printing (Despeisse et al., 2017), I4.0 technologies (Kumar et al., 2020), fintech (Pizzi et al., 2021), and artificial intelligence (Wilson et al., 2022). A series of obstacles are faced by entrepreneurs seeking to explore the potential for 3D printing in the CE (Despeisse et al., 2017). Among these challenges, there is the lack of knowledge among potential clients about the technology and its applications, the limitations to increasing scale, the dual challenge of marketing and communicating the advantages of utilisation, and the importance of applying recycled materials in addition to the investment barriers due to the technological and market uncertainties.
