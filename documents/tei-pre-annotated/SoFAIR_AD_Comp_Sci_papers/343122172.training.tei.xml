        <p>A recent industrial survey provided guidance on which aspects industry should focus on to ensure AR implementation success with following conclusions (Masood and Egger 2019): (i) technology context and organisational fit are key success factors for the AR implementation, (ii) user barrier and external support do not significantly influence the AR implementation success, (iii) while technological aspects are important, organisational issues are more relevant for industry.

        <p>At the present time, many companies see AR as an important tool to provide new services related to their products (Zubizarreta et al. 2019). By providing flexible real-time information and the possibility of obtaining information hands-free IAR can offer a substantial efficiency benefit (Guo et al. 2014;Hou and Wang 2013) by decreasing the error rate (Wang et al. 2016), like picking or assembly errors and it provides easy ways to communicate with experts in maintenance tasks (Mourtzis and Vlachou et al. 2017).At the present time, many companies see AR as an important tool to provide new services related to their products (Zubizarreta et al. 2019).

        <p>IAR can be used for assembly operations, either in training (Werrlich et al. 2017;Hahn et al. 2015) or as a live guidance system for operators (Blattgerste et al. 2017;Funk et al. 2017). In logistic, 'pick-by-vision' is a prominent concept utilising IAR to indicate picking locations and quantities (Hanson et al. 2017;Renner and Pfeiffer 2017;Guo et al. 2014;Reif et al. 2009). Another area of logistics where IAR can be used are general warehouse operations (Stoltz et al. 2017). Additional prominent fields of applications include quality assurance (Antonelli and Astanin 2015;Segovia et al. 2015) and maintenance (Martinetti et al. 2017;Masoni et al. 2017;Mourtzis and Zogopoulos et al. 2017;Palmarini et al. 2017;Zhu et al. 2012). As soon as operators depend on or can profit from (real-time) information, IAR can be used to intuitively display this information on site.IAR can be used for assembly operations, either in training (Werrlich et al. 2017;Hahn et al. 2015) or as a live guidance system for operators (Blattgerste et al. 2017;Funk et al. 2017).

        <p>The basic components of an AR system are the visualisation technology, a sensor system, a tracking system, a processing unit, and the user interface (Wang et al. 2016). The interaction between those components, their function, and the technologies used are shown in Figure 1.The basic components of an AR system are the visualisation technology, a sensor system, a tracking system, a processing unit, and the user interface (Wang et al. 2016).

        <p>When relating the industrial application to the visualisation technology, a significant difference can be observed. Static screens or projectors are used for stationary applications, like assembly operations (Funk et al. 2017). Projection-based solutions utilise projectors to display information onto the workspace (Funk et al. 2017;Funk et al. 2016). Static screens can be used to display, e.g. interactive standard operating procedures (SOPs) (Holm et al. 2017) for the current status of the assembly and animate the next assembly step. They enable operators to move around and access and read information hands-free, speeding up operations (Syberfeldt et al. 2016).When relating the industrial application to the visualisation technology, a significant difference can be observed.

        <p>Despite the advantages and the broad applicability, literature has identified a variety of different challenges, which are discussed in the following sections.Despite the advantages and the broad applicability, literature has identified a variety of different challenges, which are discussed in the following sections.</p>
        <p>In general, IAR for assembly training and for assembly guidance shows promising results in laboratory environments. While the extent to which the IAR system increased the efficiency through a decreased task completion time (TCT) and a decreased error rate depends on the task complexity (Syberfeldt et al. 2016;Henderson and Feiner 2011), several studies confirm the superiority of IAR supported assembly over conventional methods, like paper-based instructions in laboratory experiments (Uva et al. 2018;Bosch et al. 2017).In general, IAR for assembly training and for assembly guidance shows promising results in laboratory environments.

        <p>However, the participants in the studies mentioned above were recruited from an academic background. It was hypothesised in literature that this selection can influence the results (Sanna et al. 2015). This was confirmed by a long-term study conducted at an automotive factory (Funk et al. 2017). While the projection-based IAR system was useful in the learning phase for untrained workers, it slowed down expert workers. Expert workers also perceived a higher cognitive workload using the IAR system as untrained workers. Hence, the experience and the background of the users themselves influence the effect of IAR solutions.However, the participants in the studies mentioned above were recruited from an academic background.

        <p>Shop-floor and organisational processes would need to be adapted in order to gain a significant advantage by supporting the task by IAR. Integration conflicts and possible disruptions have been mentioned in literature (Funk et al. 2017;Espíndola et al. 2013;Gavish et al. 2013;Porcelli et al. 2013). Porcelli et al. (2013), for example, point out, that when using IAR in maintenance, the training and work organisation of technicians needs to change.Shop-floor and organisational processes would need to be adapted in order to gain a significant advantage by supporting the task by IAR.

        <p>In a variety of studies, the usability and ergonomics of the IAR system is a dependent variable (Kretschmer et al. 2018;Uva et al. 2018;Espíndola et al. 2013). Often, the weight of HMDs and the field of view of those devices is a point of criticism (Holm et al. 2017;Schlagowski et al. 2017;Makris et al. 2016). However, ergonomics incorporates more aspects than wearability. Murauer et al. (2018) showed that use over a work day of IAR systems can cause visual fatigue and impact concentration performance. In addition, the design of the user interface can lead to distraction or disorientation (Funk et al. 2017;Hou et al. 2013).In a variety of studies, the usability and ergonomics of the IAR system is a dependent variable (Kretschmer et al. 2018;Uva et al. 2018;Espíndola et al. 2013).

        <p>No industry-wide standard has been established yet on how to design user interfaces and user interaction for augmented reality devices. Compared to touch devices, there is no common framework on how the user can give the system feedback intuitively. Different systems on gesture recognition use different hand-gestures (Saxen et al. 2017;Wang et al. 2016;Rodriguez et al. 2015).No industry-wide standard has been established yet on how to design user interfaces and user interaction for augmented reality devices.

        <p>Most of the functionality of IAR systems is related to the software. One focus area of research is the tracking technology (Blanco-Novoa et al. 2018;Kretschmer et al. 2018;Tong et al. 2016). When placing digital content in the real world, reliable tracking of the physical world is essential to provide a coherent user experience, but hard to achieve.Most of the functionality of IAR systems is related to the software.

        <p>As the technology matures, the integration of IAR solutions into the current IT infrastructure, like product lifecycle or quality management tools is of importance (Mourtzis and Zogopoulos et al. 2017;Flatt et al. 2015;Havard et al. 2015;Serván et al. 2012). As industrial systems become digitally enabled, interfaces and content creation (authoring) need to follow certain standards (Flatt et al. 2015;Havard et al. 2015). While there is a vast number of standards available (Trappey et al. 2017), none of them is dominant yet.As the technology matures, the integration of IAR solutions into the current IT infrastructure, like product lifecycle or quality management tools is of importance (Mourtzis and Zogopoulos et al. 2017;Flatt et al. 2015;Havard et al. 2015;Serván et al. 2012).

Due to the nature of PCBs, the use of 3D holograms is not necessary. Similarly, Funk et al. (2017) utilised in-site projection to indicate parts necessary for an assembly step.

In addition, the H&amp;S aspect was included, as it was specifically highlighted during the experiments. Table 4 sums up the key-takeaways according to four of the high relevance success factors. Table 4 also provides relevant use cases.</p>
        <p>In this section, the results of the experiments are discussed, compared, and related to the literature and industrial survey (Masood and Egger 2019). Then, implications for academia and industry are outlined as well as limitations of the study and possibilities for further work.In this section, the results of the experiments are discussed, compared, and related to the literature and industrial survey (Masood and Egger 2019).

        <p>The THR is important according to the quantitative part, however not as important as the SC and the TC. This is also supported by the qualitative results, as hardware robustness and battery life are lowly ranked success factors. There are three main reasons why THR is not as important as SC and TC.The THR is important according to the quantitative part, however not as important as the SC and the TC.

        <p>1) IAR hardware is commercially available, which indicates that a certain level of maturity has been reached. This is confirmed by the experimental feedback session (see Table 3 andTable 4), where the hardware is suitable for industrial use according to the test subjects.1) IAR hardware is commercially available, which indicates that a certain level of maturity has been reached. This is confirmed by the experimental feedback session (see Table 3 andTable 4), where the hardware is suitable for industrial use according to the test subjects.</p>
        <p>2) The most significant advantage of IAR according to the survey is the effective access to information (Masood and Egger 2019). To make the information accessible on an IAR device and, thus, materialise the advantage of effective information access, the system has to be integrated into the existing IT infrastructure. Hence, the IAR system has to be (made) compatible with the current IT system (part of TC). However, compatibility with current IT system is not an important success factor according to the survey. Hence, the lack of compatibility is a challenge to overcome.2) The most significant advantage of IAR according to the survey is the effective access to information (Masood and Egger 2019).

        <p>3) Lastly, the second most important advantage is the efficiency improvement through IAR. The system needs to be correctly configured to perform. Hardware and pilot tests with the users can uncover initial problems, like low visibility of the virtual content, especially as the visualisation device and technology itself has an influence on how well the IAR system performs (Renner and Pfeiffer 2017). Hence, the SC is a crucial success factor for achieving an efficiency increase. This fact aligns with the highly ranked success factor of visibility.3) Lastly, the second most important advantage is the efficiency improvement through IAR.

        <p>The second measure of SC is the system configuration according to health and safety (H&amp;S) standards. Not only can IAR be distracting, it can also collide with regulations governing the existing (H&amp;S) system (see Table 3). Especially when users wear prescription safety glasses, the use of 3D AR HMDs, like the HoloLens, is an issue.The second measure of SC is the system configuration according to health and safety (H&amp;S) standards.

        <p>A challenge that emerged is the ability to scale the solution up easily. This challenge was confirmed in the feedback discussion after the experiment (see Table 3). While the cost of hardware is no issue, the ability to scale the software applications up efficiently is as system integration and content authoring are difficult (see Table 3 andTable 4). Currently, it takes programming experience to develop for every new task (for example a change in the maintenance procedure), which scales with a large-scale implementation.A challenge that emerged is the ability to scale the solution up easily.

        <p>From experiments, it is evident that the user acceptance is an important challenge and a significant success factor respectively. The experiments show that introducing the technology to operators can decrease the user barriors (UB) challenge if the technology is easy to use and demonstrates capabilities useful for users. It was stated by several operators after the experiment that their reservations towards AR were alleviated through the process of introducing them to the technology and gathering their feedback (see Table 3 andTable 4).From experiments, it is evident that the user acceptance is an important challenge and a significant success factor respectively.

        <p>While the NASA TLX results do not indicate a significant difference in perceived workload between operators and non-operators (see Figure 0), the TCT differs significantly (see Figure 9). Non-operators were on average 110s faster than operators. These results contrast a longterm study where untrained workers report a lower NASA TLX and have a similar TCT (Funk et al. 2017). This could be explained by the knowledge and experience non-operators have of IAR compared to operators (see Table 2) within this research. This highlights the importance to educate and include operators early on in the implementation project to gain the expected benefits.While the NASA TLX results do not indicate a significant difference in perceived workload between operators and non-operators (see Figure 0), the TCT differs significantly (see Figure 9).

        <p>In general, the qualitative results indicate that most of the challenges industry is concerned with stem from an organisational point of view in contrast to academic research, which tends to have a technological focus. Yet, this is no indication that academia is not concerned with the organisation context, as the challenge categories are outlined in the literature. The survey data shows that 70% of the pilot and implementation project have started within the last three years (Masood and Egger 2019). Thus, it is possible that academic research has not sufficiently tackled the problem yet.In general, the qualitative results indicate that most of the challenges industry is concerned with stem from an organisational point of view in contrast to academic research, which tends to have a technological focus.

        <p>The quantitative part of the survey was used to prioritise the challenges and success factors, which are validated through the qualitative part of the survey. Despite the fact that UB was not significantly correlated to IS, user acceptance is on top of the success factors and the challenges, as the qualitative part indicates that user acceptance is a key challenge and success factor. In addition, the qualitative part was used to differentiate between challenges and success factors and to uncover challenges not mentioned in the studies reviewed in the systematic literature review.The quantitative part of the survey was used to prioritise the challenges and success factors, which are validated through the qualitative part of the survey.

        <p>It has to be noted that focusing on the identified challenges and success factors does not guarantee success when implementing IAR. Some factors were unveiled in the qualitative part, but it is unclear how strong their influence is. In addition, other factors related to different contexts might exist.

        <p>Academic and industrial research on AR is quite different, the former looks for new science, more robust algorithms and faster response, while industry wants solutions to their problems, to increase productivity and shorten learning curve. It is important to address how a balance can be achieved in getting the most out of AR research and applications. This article is a step forward in achieving a balance by providing insights from academic literature and linking those with industrial thinking while also providing evidence through industrial experiments.Academic and industrial research on AR is quite different, the former looks for new science, more robust algorithms and faster response, while industry wants solutions to their problems, to increase productivity and shorten learning curve.

        <p>IAR is a fairly new technology in industry without widespread adoption. The capabilities of the technology are still important and will be important in future, especially in support of achieving Industry 4.0 objectives, as it has not reached maturity yet. However, the technology tends to be not as important as organisational issues when implementing IAR. This shift from a technology focus to an organisational focus is not reflected in the IAR research. Due to the significant implications of the organisational fit and the compatibility of the technology towards IS, future research can focus on how to adapt processes for IAR, how to align it with the current systems, or how to ensure the operator's health and safety when using those systems.IAR is a fairly new technology in industry without widespread adoption.

        <p>User acceptance is not only a success factor, but a lack of it is a serious challenge to overcome. Despite the latent variable UB not correlating significantly with the IS of IAR, the qualitative and experimental findings show the importance of users conclusively. Educating users and showing use cases relevant to them can alleviate this challenge. Additionally, the lack of the fragmented ecosystem leads to upscaling issues, as no easy way of content creation exists. It is the authors opinion that this challenge will diminish over time, as a dominant and easy way to create content will arise eventually.User acceptance is not only a success factor, but a lack of it is a serious challenge to overcome.
