        <p>The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) has introduced the paradigm of Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) to enable efficient and fast data processing in mobile networks. Among other technological requirements, security and privacy are significant factors in the realization of MEC deployments. In this paper, we analyse the security and privacy of the MEC system. We introduce a thorough investigation of the identification and the analysis of threat vectors in the ETSI standardized MEC architecture. Furthermore, we analyse the vulnerabilities leading to the identified threat vectors and propose potential security solutions to overcome these vulnerabilities. The privacy issues of MEC are also highlighted, and clear objectives for preserving privacy are defined. Finally, we present future directives to enhance the security and privacy of MEC services.The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) has introduced the paradigm of Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) to enable efficient and fast data processing in mobile networks.

        <p>Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) is a nascent paradigm proposed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to overcome the issues exerted from intricacies in highly evolving mobile and wireless communication networks. The underlying principle of MEC is to extend the cloud computing (CC) capabilities to the edge of the mobile network to curtail the attributed constraints on existing cloud infrastructure [1]. More anecdotally, MEC complements the corporate data and processing centres, providing compute, storage, networking, and data analytic resources at locations in the proximity of the data source [2]. The impending fifth generation (5G) mobile technology is one of the rationales for the emergence of MEC. The guaranteed performance metrics of 5G are: data rates up to 10 GB/s, service level latency below 1 ms, ultra-high reliability of 99.99999%, reduced energy consumption of 90%, and support for 300,000 devices within a single cell [1], [3]. In order to meet these requirements, migrating the service infrastructure to a proximate location is a critical approach. Thus, the MEC paradigm is formed and designed with the above considerations.Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) is a nascent paradigm proposed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to overcome the issues exerted from intricacies in highly evolving mobile and wireless communication networks.

The resource availability in the in-proximity edge servers of MEC deployments are elevating the feasibility of launching realtime applications with improved autonomy. Thus, connectivity to the centralized cloud infrastructure is not required for multitudes of functions in applications hosted on current smart devices.

        <p>In the existing CC service architecture depicted in Fig. 1, all the emanated service requests in the Radio Access Network (RAN) are traversed to the cloud servers, which are located at different global locations due to the non-existent storage and processing platform at the BS. The subscribers are unaware of the exact locations of the servers due to the outsourcing process. This fact is raising security and privacy concerns, as the personal data of the subscribers are handled by third parties without any concrete assurances. The channel conveying the elevated service requests and data to the cloud servers is bound to form a bottleneck in the network traffic in addition to the RAN access interface [4]. Therefore, CC-based services are expected to endure latency issues, jitter, and unresponsiveness in addition to the security ramifications from service interruption-based attacks perpetrated by adversaries. These factors prove the improbability of successfully deploying impending applications with 5G technology such as Ultra High Definition (UHD) video streaming, Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Mixed Reality (MR), Tactile internet, Machine Type Communication (MTC), Machine-to-Machine (M2M), Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2E). The storage and processing infrastructure facilitated by MEC deployments, however, are ensuring the benefits of ultra-low latency, locational awareness, proximate data outsourcing, and improved capacity in the edge devices. These features enable higher bandwidth and real-time responsiveness to the subscriber applications. Moreover, MEC-based services within the RAN enhance computational processing power to avoid bottlenecks with directed mobile traffic [5]. These factors are making MEC the preeminent technology behind 5G deployment.In the existing CC service architecture depicted in Fig. 1, all the emanated service requests in the Radio Access Network (RAN) are traversed to the cloud servers, which are located at different global locations due to the non-existent storage and processing platform at the BS.

        <p>Security is a broader concept that extends to the notions of information security, cyber-security, forensic security, and network security. Information security was defined as the preservation of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (also referred as the CIA triad) of information under the standard ISO/IEC 27002 in 2005 [6]. The information under this definition is applicable to physical or electronic/digital forms of data that are subject to be documented, stored, in transit, or conversed. Forensic security covers acts committed against the laws and statutes in the governing domain. In the IT domain however, digital forensic methods are used for ensuring security. A more nascent definition for cybersecurity is presented in [7] as the approaches and actions associated with security management processes followed by organizations and states for protecting CIA of data and assets in cyber-space-though latest requirements of cyber-security are going beyond CIA aspects. Factors such as traceability, authentication, authorization, anonymization, granularity, localization, and trust are novel requirements for systems where cyber-security is applicable.Security is a broader concept that extends to the notions of information security, cyber-security, forensic security, and network security.

        <p>Initially, network security was defined as the means to secure the communication networks from possible intrusions and vulnerabilities. Those attacks and threats were limited to the intervening and masquerading attacks such as Man-in-the-Middle (MitM), Relay, and spoofing. With adequate levels of encryption and cryptography primitives, probable attacks were plausibly mitigated. However, novel communication services are prioritizing the data rate of the network to serve more subscribers. Thus, cumbersome cryptographic primitives are imprudent. Moreover, softwarized approaches of Software Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), and Network Slicing demand more requirements for security assurance as presented in [8]. Most of the emerging systems are Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) that integrate computation, networking, and physical processes to create an environment extending to cyber and physical spaces. Thus, security for a CPS represents an extensive domain for cyber, information, forensic, and network security contexts.Initially, network security was defined as the means to secure the communication networks from possible intrusions and vulnerabilities.

        <p>Privacy is an individual's right to act or behave independent of any records or surveillance activity conducted without their consent. In the digital context, personal data cannot be mishandled by service providers without their consent, and measures should be taken to keep safe a user's identity, while the user actions should be untraceable. Irresponsible entities possessing personal data of their consumers, might opt to outsource them to an external institution for deriving personal intents, behaviours, or interests to expand their commercial market. Furthermore, adversaries are capable of extracting personal credentials from weakly protected system to violate their privacy. These acts are recognized as unlawful practices, and novel legislations are focused on mitigating these occurrences. Advancement of sensory devices appended to both human and non-human entities are increasing the possibility of privacy leakages [9].Privacy is an individual's right to act or behave independent of any records or surveillance activity conducted without their consent.

        <p>The edge of the mobile network is the access point to all the services emanated in the RAN. This critical juncture is one of the weakest points in the entire network in terms of security. The majority of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in the market are produced with economically manufactured circuitry that employs weak encryption/encoding schemes and other security measures for maintaining an affordable price range in order to compete. Most such devices are vulnerable to cloning and physical tampering, imperilling the entire mobile network for countless attacks. Verifying the credibility of these devices at the edge is a major concern. In addition, the distributed nature of the MEC paradigm is broadening the avenues for adversaries, due to the migration of storage and processing service infrastructure to a proximate radio access range. Even a service impeding attempt intimidates the purpose of MEC, for attaining ultra-low latency to provision real-time 5G based services.The edge of the mobile network is the access point to all the services emanated in the RAN.

        <p>Impending applications and services are demanding the handling of personal credentials/information at the edge of the network for realizing the service requisites. Privacy, integrity, and trust management assurances are prime requirements with MEC deployments, despite the attributed locational and contextual awareness facilitated for the users. It is evident that virtualization technologies are vital for realizing the MEC paradigm and for creating a serviceable platform with dynamic resource allocation capability. Security of the virtualized platforms are still a gray area, due to lesser deployments. The vulnerabilities and attacks plausible on Virtual Machines (VMs) are unique and cause significant consequences to the MEC system. Similar to CC, outsourcing MEC subscriber data to a remote storage and processing environment creates a predicament in terms of privacy rights. Establishing boundaries regarding the extent of authorized conduct on service providers capabilities is imperative for guaranteeing the trust of MEC consumers. Considering all these facts, security and privacy are important for realizing a pragmatic MEC paradigm deployment. Since security is a vast concept, a proper classification is required to simplify the various aspects that apply to the MEC context. In this paper, security is mainly classified under conventional security aspects and MEC specific security issues as depicted in the Fig. 2. Under conventional or classical security aspects (in Section III), the Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Authentication, and Authorization aspects are considered. The MEC specific security issues specified in Section IV, are derived based on their threat applicability. Threat Vectors (TVs) are formed to identify the vulnerabilities/flows associated with MEC deployments. These TVs are further categorized into locational, architectural, and other aspects for better clarity.Impending applications and services are demanding the handling of personal credentials/information at the edge of the network for realizing the service requisites.

        <p>MEC is a paradigm that depends entirely on mobile network deployment. Due to this dependency, integrating upcoming 5G technology to MEC should be approached with caution. Thus, materials available for the MEC paradigm are limited and more generic in terms of certain aspects. Security is one such aspect that has not been addressed by existing research, specifically in relation to standardization, due to the heterogeneous deployment scenarios applicable in the radio access network. Therefore, the prime motivation of this paper is to identify the threat vectors of the MEC system in accordance to the ETSI standards and to investigate the integration technologies for proposing solutions for the security issues.MEC is a paradigm that depends entirely on mobile network deployment.

The papers [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [16], [17], [21], [22], and [23] did not address security as a key aspect of MEC. Certain surveys, such as [1], [25], [20], [9], and [5] focus heavily on security and privacy although the context is not concurring to the ETSI standardized MEC architecture and its components. Additionally, prevailing literature does not consider the privacy aspect of MEC based deployments that extend to identifying related issues nor goals to preserve the subscriber trust. To the best of our knowledge, there is not a single study that investigates the security and privacy aspects of MEC in accordance to the ETSI standards.Roman et al. in [25] conducted a comprehensive survey on security aspects of edge computing paradigms, identifying their threat models.

        <p>The formation of edge computing paradigms began in the 1990s when Akamai technologies launched a Content Delivery Network (CDN) as an approach to disperse the data centre functionalities infracting against the centralized system [42]. Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC), fog computing, and cloudlets are other edge paradigms recognized in the scientific research community apart from MEC [1]. The motivation behind edge computing technologies is to extend the constricted CC functionalities and reinforce the service access infrastructure. Thus, some attributes of these paradigms resemble each other, apart from subtle differences. Divergence in the architecture, however, limits the deployment options for certain applications and technologies.The formation of edge computing paradigms began in the 1990s when Akamai technologies launched a Content Delivery Network (CDN) as an approach to disperse the data centre functionalities infracting against the centralized system [42].

        <p>The main concept of MCC is to augment the computing capabilities of mobile devices for extending battery life and storage capacity, while offering adaptability, scalability, mobility, availability, and self-awareness in mobile computing environments [29]. Later, the intention was revised to execute mobile devices at the edge as an alternative to the centralized architecture [25]. The approach offloads the mobile process as a clone or a partial migration of the mobile agent to be executed at the edge entity, leaving the cloud infrastructure intact. The program portioning and the thread migration scenarios of the mobile device cloning process engaging various elasticity patterns as presented by Khan et al. in [43] are the prime examples of the deployment models in MCC. In spite of facilitation on deploying m-learning, m-gaming, m-healthcare, AR, and crowd-sourcing applications, public clouds fails to fulfill the latency requirements of the centralized cloud architecture that affect the end user Quality of Experience (QoE) [3]. Thus, employing MCC for real-time applications catered by 5G technology is improbable.The main concept of MCC is to augment the computing capabilities of mobile devices for extending battery life and storage capacity, while offering adaptability, scalability, mobility, availability, and self-awareness in mobile computing environments [29].

        <p>Fog computing was introduced by the Cisco systems in 2012, envisioning an infrastructure formed by a collaborative cloud network that facilitates services performed by geographically dispersed edge nodes equipped with similar but limited resources comprising the main cloud. OpenFog Consortium, an association that promotes fog computing, defines fog computing as "a system-level horizontal architecture that distributes resources and services of computing, storage, control and networking anywhere along the continuum from cloud to Things" [27]. In this concept, cloud services are deployed at the edge of the network with the Internet Protocol (IP) or Multi-protocol Label Switching (MPLS) backbones in close proximity to the IoT devices. Even though the initial understanding was to make fog computing a mere extension of cloud computing, later research has defined it to be a paradigm of its own, which would be a platform to orchestrate the deployment of heterogeneous IoT applications. Fog computing forms a three-tier architecture within the strata: cloud, fog, and end user stratums [30]. Fog nodes that are formed on the virtualized technology and operate in the fog stratum link the end devices to the cloud data centre while maintaining the fog-to-fog connections that expand the fog network. The flexibility of fog node deployment enables the application of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) using wireless electroencephalogram (EEG) headsets, AR, real-time video analytics, cyber-physical systems, and V2E [25]. The fog nodes, which attribute comprehensive resources and functions, form a holistic and dispersed service infrastructure that realizes 5G use cases.Fog computing was introduced by the Cisco systems in 2012, envisioning an infrastructure formed by a collaborative cloud network that facilitates services performed by geographically dispersed edge nodes equipped with similar but limited resources comprising the main cloud.

        <p>The cloudlet concept was first proposed by Satyanarayanan et al. in 2009 as a small cloud infrastructure located near mobile users, which could be used at small businesses or industries [28]. They are also referred as Micro Data Centers (MDCs), proposed by Microsoft Research in 2015 as an extension of traditional data centers used in cloud computing [10]. The cloudlet architecture resembles the fog computing three-tier model, where the end devices, cloudlet-based edge cloud platform, and centralized data centre form the system structure [3]. Cloudlets are deployed as VMs that facilitate a transient environment for users in a local vicinity. Offloading and caching tasks are probable with the small scale cloudlets, where face recognition and video streaming applications are ideal deployments that emulate the scaled virtual environment [30]. In addition, approaches such as Hyrax, FemtoClouds, Superfluid clouds, Edge-Centric computing, Mist computing, Cloud of Things (CoT) and Edge Cloud (EC) are alternative edge technologies proposed for various deployments that operate at diverse scales [25] [10]. Table III summarizes the comparative factors of the discussed edge paradigms.The cloudlet concept was first proposed by Satyanarayanan et al. in 2009 as a small cloud infrastructure located near mobile users, which could be used at small businesses or industries [28].

        <p>The scope of possibilities has been expanded with the advent of Integrated Circuits (ICs) as a paradigm shift that produced the third generation of Personal Computers (PCs) in the 1980s, which revolutionized industries from mechanical processing to electronic-based processing systems. After almost four decades, 5 nm silicon chips are produced to miniaturize computers into smart devices that produce a higher processing power than that of early PCs. Hence, means of computational processing capabilities, which were once deployed by cumbersome PCs, have been drastically reduced to handheld devices at present, and possibly way diminutive in the future. Thus, management of data storage, networking resources, battery lifetime, computational power, and memory limitations in handheld devices is disconcerting to Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) [3]. The data storage and processing services have evolved from mainframes (BITNET-1981) to dedicated servers and cloud computing, while networking services advanced from Advance Research Project Agency Network (ARPANET-1961) to Internet (1969), to Ethernet, to SATNET, to IPv4 based TCP/IP, to IPv6, to 802.11 Wi-Fi, to 802.11a, to 802.11g, and to 802.11n. Moreover, mobile networks evolved from 1G, to 2G -Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM), to 3G, to 3.5G -High Speed Packet Access, to 4G and to 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE).The scope of possibilities has been expanded with the advent of Integrated Circuits (ICs) as a paradigm shift that produced the third generation of Personal Computers (PCs) in the 1980s, which revolutionized industries from mechanical processing to electronic-based processing systems.

        <p>The emergence of the IoT paradigm envisioning the anytime, anywhere connectivity for myriad versatile and comparatively miniaturized smart devices was first mentioned by Kevin Ashton in 1999 at MIT while Chana Schoenberger and Bruce Upbin published the paper titled 'The Internet of Things' in Forbes' 2002 issue, documenting the concept for the first time. However, the drawbacks and limitations in cloud computing that are exacerbated by the 3.9 billion current internet users present a significant scarcity for capacity in the MNO perspective. Even though the capacity of the core network and cloud infrastructure is upgraded, the existing mobile network limits the accessibility of increasing the number of IoT devices and launching impending applications. Thus, the novel approach of MEC is proposed as a paradigm shift to the processing and storage solutions that are amalgamated with the 5G mobile technology. The networking infrastructure for IoT, integrated with the MEC and other edge computing paradigms, are envisioned by Tactile Internet which guarantees ultra-low latency, extreme availability, reliability, and security provisioned from 5G and beyond 5G technologies [1].The emergence of the IoT paradigm envisioning the anytime, anywhere connectivity for myriad versatile and comparatively miniaturized smart devices was first mentioned by Kevin Ashton in 1999 at MIT while Chana Schoenberger and Bruce Upbin published the paper titled 'The Internet of Things' in Forbes' 2002 issue, documenting the concept for the first time.

        <p>The IBM and Nokia Siemens network introduced MEC in 2013 as a platform that could execute applications within a mobile base station, where the aspects of application migration and interoperability were not considered [25]. Later in 2014, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) launched the Industry Specification Group (ISG) for standardizing Mobile Edge Computing, which describes the operation of MEC as such: "Mobile edge computing provides an IT service environment and cloud computing capabilities at the edge of the mobile network, within the RAN and in close proximity to mobile subscribers" [26].The IBM and Nokia Siemens network introduced MEC in 2013 as a platform that could execute applications within a mobile base station, where the aspects of application migration and interoperability were not considered [25].

        <p>Pioneers in mobile network solution providers, such as Nokia Networks, Intel, Vodafone, IBM, Huawei, and NTT DOCOMO, were leading the ISG representation, while European 5G Infrastructure Public Private Partnership (5G-PPP) acknowledged MEC as a prime emerging technology for 5G networks [5]. The goal of ETSI MEC ISG was to facilitate an open environment for multiple vendors, providing diverse applications and services at the edge of RAN merely to overcome the limitations of existing centralized cloud computing deployments [3]. A Proof of Concept (PoC) framework for MEC was published by ETSI ISG in 2015 to highlight the rationale, roles, responsibilities, and the activity processes of the PoC framework. In the same year, another white paper was released for evaluating the business value of MEC service scenarios such as AR, intelligent video acceleration, connected cars, and IoT gateways to identify the market drives. The MEC framework and reference architecture was published in 2016 by ISG for formulating the entities in the MEC system and to define their intended function [44]. The potential of the MEC paradigm is reaching beyond mobile networks to Wi-Fi and fixed access technologies. ETSI ISG has renamed the concept "Multi-Access Edge Computing" which conveniently justifies the acronym MEC [1]. Additionally, a 2018 ISG release accentuates the deployment scenarios and use case exemplifications of MEC with 5G integration [45]. This white paper investigates the deployment of MEC and 5G components in actual use cases with traffic steering, mobility, offloading, charging, and regulatory requirement considerations. An extension of the same directive was presented in [46] as the 2nd specification release that expands the scope of MEC use cases for camera as a service (also known as video surveillance as a service), video delivery, future factories, multi-radio access technology (multi-RAT), Internet Protocol television (IPTV), in-vehicle systems, and 5G use cases.

        <p>User Equipment (UE) is the devices that connect to the MEC edge through the access network.

        <p>The connectivity of UE Apps to the MEC host level, however, is commandeered by the User Application Life-Cycle Management Proxy (UALCMP). UALCMP handles the initial UE App requests for subscriptions. Though UALCMP is located at the mobile edge system level, subscription requests conveyed through the access network are forwarded to it from the edge network. A similar function is performed by the Customer Facing Service (CFS) Portal for third-party customers of the MEC service provider or the mobile operator for facilitating the MEC services. Operation Support System (OSS) is the entity that handles the user access authorization and subscription elapsing duration distinguishing the service types forwarded from UALCMP and CFS portal. Additionally, connections are maintained with the mobile edge platform manager and the mobile edge orchestrator for virtual resource allocation to subscribed UE Apps and provisioning service logs, respectively. The Mobile Edge Orchestrator (MEO) is the principal entity at a mobile edge system level that governs single or several mobile edge host levels. The MEO is linked to the OSS and UALCMP entities operating at the MEC system level, while connections are extended to the mobile edge platform manager and virtualization infrastructure manager in the MEC host level. The holistic management of operating MEC hosts, catered services with resource utilization and employability of the standardized topologies, are administered by the MEO.The connectivity of UE Apps to the MEC host level, however, is commandeered by the User Application Life-Cycle Management Proxy (UALCMP).

        <p>2) Mobile Edge Host Level Mobile Edge Platform Manager (MEPM) acts as the orchestrator for the mobile edge host level. MEPM manages the rules, requirements, and life-cycle of mobile edge applications by handling the storing, configuring, and running functions of software images in the host virtual environments. Virtualization Infrastructure Manager (VIM) governs the virtualized resources in every mobile edge host launched at the mobile edge host level. It is connected to the virtualization infrastructure of each mobile edge host, while the status of the virtual resources is updated to the MEO [45]. The Mobile Edge Platform (MEP) dispenses the provisions to launch the ME Apps while creating an environment to discover, advertise and consume mobile edge services. The MEPM-condoned traffic rules are notified to the LADN at the MEH by the traffic rules controller, where DNS and proxy functions are administered based on the MEPM records. Virtualization Infrastructure (VI) is the platform on which the ME App VMs are functioning. The VI comprising the LADN is commandeered by the VIM and MEP for managing virtual resources and enforcing traffic rules, respectively. In relation to the MEC system, a Mobile Edge Service (MES) is defined as a service originated or facilitated by either the MEP or ME Apps. All the provisioned services are registered under the MEP through the Mp1 interface, where the ME App is subscribing to the relevant authorized services. More details regarding the interfaces in Fig. 3 are explicated in [44].2) Mobile Edge Host Level Mobile Edge Platform Manager (MEPM) acts as the orchestrator for the mobile edge host level.

        <p>Confidentiality is the act of preventing unauthorized entities from reading or accessing sensitive materials [48]. This aspect of security obscures information by encrypting the payload with a considerable level of cryptography. At the design stages, obscuring information that ingresses, egresses, and traverses within the MEC system is a critical requirement.

        <p>1) Possible Availability Violations: DoS-adjacent attacks that impede services are the main cause for availability disruptions in communication channels. In the existing LTE network model, the Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection status creates issues with validating the eNodeB for the UE [59]. Thus, it creates opportunities for DoS attacks, compromising the availability of eNodeBs. Since the UE requests are directed to the UALCMP initially, its capacity for serving UE should improve significantly to cater to the 5G based applications. Once the service request is granted, UE establishes a direct link with the MEC edge for instigating its service. This channel is formed via the RAN and connects to the MEH via the UPF instance in the LADN. Thus, the N3 interface of the 5G service architecture should feature adequate capacity to handle minimum UE requirements [45]. Failing to integrate these requirements to the novel networking interfaces compromises the network flow and results in inaccessibility. Further, the nature of service denial attacks has evolved drastically over the years, delivering distributed attacks with a multitude of bots. These bot-net type attacks limit the accessibility of legitimate users, compromising their availability.1) Possible Availability Violations: DoS-adjacent attacks that impede services are the main cause for availability disruptions in communication channels.

Thus, light-weight primitives as indicated in the study by Chen [80] or QR crypto approaches [68] can be engaged to heighten the complexity of the security schemes. Another way to reduce the load of the application layer is to embed the security mechanisms into the PHY layer as in PLS approaches specified above. However, these approaches are diverse and reliant on the communication device (i.e. vendor architecture), medium (i.e. wireless/ wired, FO), and the technology (i.e. BLE, Wi-Fi, Zigbee, or Lo-RaWAN). Therefore, a compliance on the PLS primitives to be employed should be established to prevent interoperability and compatibility issues with PHY layer protocols. 5G-based RF networks are still at an experimental stage. Both channel models and network architectures should be specified and standardized for each 5G-based use case to avoid discrepancies after deployment. Security and privacy should also be considered primary requirements when forming such standardization.The usage of conventional security primitives, though they are enhanced, aggregate unwanted burden on the application layer payload space of the traffic delivery. Despite the improved BW and multiple channel support furnished by 5G and MEC, these cumbersome approaches are limiting the extent of novel applications, such as autonomous vehicles, to broaden their features.

        <p>2) A2: Ad-hoc connectivity between User Equipment The threats on A2 are associated with the links that are established between UEs in an ad-hoc manner. These links employ short range communication channels that are used for data transferring purpose under the influence of specific UE Apps. The connectivity type is Device-to-Device (D2D) that establishes a direct communication link between two devices, without requiring any BS for connectivity [81]. Short range communication technologies such as Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Near Field Communication (NFC), ZigBee, Wi-Fi direct, narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), SIGFOX or any technology which could form a Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) are capable of deploying connections between UEs [1], [25], [55]. Moreover,

        <p>Most of such attacks are feasible due to the nature of the communication protocols embedded within short range communication technologies. These technologies prioritize leveraging the bandwidth for D2D execution rather than employing security measures. • D2D traffic offloading: The method of offloading cellular traffic to the UEs by the MNO is an example of a D2D instance [81]. In this approach, MNO only transmits content to specific UEs considered as cluster heads, and those UEs are multi-casting the content to respective UEs in the scope of the cluster. Moreover, use cases, such as extending the coverage through D2D connectivity for rural areas and establishment of critical communication channels for disaster or terrorist situations (where the cellular network is disabled), envision future potential for D2D-based services. In these use cases, connectivity between a UE cluster head and the MEC servers is maintained for content sharing under the supervision of the MNO. Thus, this scenario opens up new possibilities for adversaries to exploit the cluster head UEs for manipulating the service offered from them. Existing Solutions: Ensuring D2D security mainly involves authentication, while the intervening attacks can be mitigated through a layered security model.Most of such attacks are feasible due to the nature of the communication protocols embedded within short range communication technologies.

        <p>• Authentication mechanisms: In order to overcome the possible vulnerabilities of the ad-hoc link, an autonomous authentication mechanism is an intrinsic necessity, prior to establishing the D2D link.

Thus, lightweight approaches are essential to conserve energy, while security keys, hashes, and authentication codes should be generated in an optimal way. As these protocols are mostly autonomous, authentication credentials are computed in an algorithmic manner which can be replicated by a resourceful adversary. Thus, PUF fulfills a lacking aspect of M2M communication by employing unique and non-crypt analytic parameters to secure the D2D channels. However, in authentication stages or in a layered security circumstance, the repeated message flows included with encapsulation, coding, and modulation constructs consume energy that does not contribute to the throughput.

The UE contains information related to various aspects of the daily life of a person, such as private information (photos, medical reports, medical statistics, and CCTV footage), location (GPS), daily routines (shopping and transportation), enterprise information, critical infrastructure information (energy consumption, financial, banking, and emergency service status) and online account statistics-where divulging such credentials and parameters could be fatal for one's well-being [25]. Thus, threats to mobile users' privacy is of great concern [17], [5]. The resources embedded to a UE in terms of processing power, storage capacity, and battery life are the most significant factors for this threat vector [76]. Certain softwareized and virtualized attacks require a minimum level of resources to launch in an executable platform. Thus, enhanced processing and storage resources in the current UEs improve the possibility of launching such attacks that are capable of hindering detection by conventional means.

        <p>Summary: The higher resources and functions available for mobile devices are attracting novel, application-level threats, in addition to the typical malware, SCA, physical, or cloning attacks. In fact, adversaries can combine the method of attacking, where both malware and SCA type attacks can be perpetrated in a single threat attempt. A typical IDS is not adequate to detect all such novel attacks. Thus, applicationlevel security features should be embedded into mobile devices in their design stages to detect and prevent them. Though there are techniques for detecting SCAs currently, novel side channels are determined by adversaries from time to time. The processors, circuitry, and TRX interfaces should be subject to extensive security tests prior to releasing the product.

An application of MEC-based Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) vehicular use case is modeled to the proposed framework. A LTE/System Architecture Evolution (SAE) network inclusive of the MEC edge level is mapped to the security chain enabled domain, while MEC-based ITS system level is mapped to the security chain controller. The proposed system, however, is only applicable to a scenario where the MEC subscribed services are operated by servers or clouds deployed external to the MEC system level entities, and the network traffic is forwarded and monitored from the SDN based MEC edge level. Thus, such an approach is applicable to E7 for securing the network traffic extended to the third party service infrastructures. • SCA detection on VMs and clouds: Zhang et al. [103] introduced a SCA detection method for clouds called 
            <rs type="software">CloudRadar</rs>. The SCAs are detected as anomalies in the cache behaviour of VMs operating in the edge environment. Summary: Determining the novel threats possible on an edge platform formed with virtualization technologies is a challenge that should be addressed prior to deploying MEC. TPMs offer the ability to attest the connecting UEs to determine their legitimacy. This is an important fact that leads to preventing the edge platform from malicious penetrations. Furthermore, VMIs are key tools for determining anomalous behaviour of virtual entities. These two technologies together form a protective shell to prevent malicious injections from ingressing to the MEC edge level. A VMI can be attached to the VIM that monitors the VM performance, while a TPM can be connected with the MEPM for distinguishing malicious ME Apps from the legitimate ones. In addition, security mechanisms can be embedded into the virtual infrastructure when forming virtual entities or VMs. However, light-weight virtualization or containerization technologies are attributing lesser securing mechanisms. Thus, security constructs should be implemented at the VM or hypervisor platform level. Furthermore, orchestration function of the MEPM should be designed with the security-aware features.

        <p>• TCP/IP attacks on the channel linking MEO and the 5G core: It is more common to use separate physical hosts for 5G core network and MEO [105]. In that case, the control traffic will be transferred between two entities via an open 5G backhaul network. Therefore, the interface between MEO and 5G core will be vulnerable to typical TCP/IP attacks such as eavesdropping, spoofing, DoS, replay, and reset attacks. It is mandatory to enable proper security mechanisms, such as mutual authentication, E2E encryption, or Challenge-Response Procedures (CRPs), to mitigate these issues. The impact of these attacks will be minimum if both MEO and 5G core are deployed in the same physical host. • Lack of a standard interface: Another challenge is to properly define an interface between 5G Core and MEO [106]. It is challenging to define a proper and unified security mechanism without a standard interface. However, this challenge is somewhat relaxed since ETSI [107] is leading both 5G and MEC standardization tasks.• TCP/IP attacks on the channel linking MEO and the 5G core: It is more common to use separate physical hosts for 5G core network and MEO [105].

        <p>• Nature of softwarized core: In contrast to pre-5G networks, 5G networks have a softwarized or virtualized core [108]. Here, all the core network functions are implemented as VNFs. However, several security concerns are observable in the functionality of VNFs. The hardware based pre-5G core network had natural protection against many attacks due to its closed, complex, and vendorspecific nature [109]. However, the NFV base 5G core network is open and software controllable. It is comparably easy to manipulate a software-based system than a hardware-based system. • Typical VNF based attacks: VNFs are vulnerable to attacks such as interoperability issues [110], VM escape [111], VNF Manipulation [69] and VNF location shift attacks [69]. • Mismatching policies: Different VNFs are developed by different VNF providers, and they attribute different levels of security polices. The mismatch between these differences can lead to vulnerabilities when they are deployed in the same system [110]. • VNF based service denying attacks: A variety of DoS/DDoS attacks on targeted services is possible when VNFs are hosted in the cloud, e.g attack on Bitbucket [112]. The impact of DDoS is even greater for virtualized networks, since this attack could spread to untargeted VNFs that are hosted on the same physical host [113]. • VNF software flaws: Since VNFs are software, they are vulnerable to software flaws which can lead to unintended behaviour. For instance, these software flaws can be used to bypass firewall restrictions or perpetrate buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code [113]. • Hypervisor flaws: A malicious VM can escape from the virtualization environment and execute arbitrary code within the hypervisor to compromise it [111]. An attacker misuses the privileges of a compromised hypervisor to install kernel root kits in VNF's OS and to manipulate the VNF [69]. • Issues in migration: An attacker can migrate from a compromised VNF to a different location where fewer security or privacy policies are enforced to gain additional access to the system [69]. Existing Solutions related to the Core network: Since the core network or MEC system level forms a virtualized infrastructure, certain solutions applicable to MEN also apply here.• Nature of softwarized core: In contrast to pre-5G networks, 5G networks have a softwarized or virtualized core [108].

        <p>• Updating security credentials: As the MEO is the main hypervisor at the system level of the MEC deployment, it is critical to update the security patches timely while activating remote access services such as Secure Shell (SSH) only when required [69]. A strong password policy is also required for cloud and system level administrators. • Kernel hardening tools: The use of Security Enhanced 
            <rs type="software">Linux</rs> (SELinux) for the ME system level would benefit from the kernel hardening tools such as secure virtualization (
            <rs type="software">sVirt</rs>) or hidepd, where the separation between data files and the processes are instigated. Thus, the infrastructure of 
            <rs type="software">Linux</rs> kernels would enhance the possibility for counterattacking the external or internal impregnation attempts at each entity at system level. • Hypervisor introspection: Hypervisor introspection [121] could be used at system level for detecting anomalous behavior. • Remote attestation: Linking the remote attestation server with the edge and system levels would provide the MEO with the capability to visualize the subscribed processes transparently for verification [97].

        <p>Vulnerabilities: Most of the threats directed toward the network slicing technique exist through the network's vulnerabilities; these include the non-existent mutual authentication schemes between the entities in different slices; insecure communication among Network Slice Instances (NSIs) and Network Slice Managers (NSMs); incompatibility of diverse security protocols and policies at different slices; different security levels at different slices which could permit an attacker to exhaust the resources a secure slice gaining the access from a low security slice; and attachment of UE to multiple slices which increases the tendency for blending of information flaws in case of an infected UE App [125].Vulnerabilities: Most of the threats directed toward the network slicing technique exist through the network's vulnerabilities; these include the non-existent mutual authentication schemes between the entities in different slices; insecure communication among Network Slice Instances (NSIs) and Network Slice Managers (NSMs); incompatibility of diverse security protocols and policies at different slices; different security levels at different slices which could permit an attacker to exhaust the resources a secure slice gaining the access from a low security slice; and attachment of UE to multiple slices which increases the tendency for blending of information flaws in case of an infected UE App [125].</p>

        <p>• Auditing and validation of NSIs: The NSIs that execute virtual functions or VMs should be audited and validated periodically to prevent VM-based attacks. • Security differentiation and slice isolation: Different security levels should be applied to network slices with adequate isolation so that the reach of the malicious agents is restricted. • Authentication framework: Ni et al. [122] proposed a service-oriented authentication framework to support NS in 5G-enabled IoT services. The proposed framework focuses on fog computing architecture for describing the authentication sequences. However, the deployment of network slices in the proposed framework is adaptable to both fog and MEC paradigms considering the resem-blance in the service structure in the access network entities, while the core network is served by the 5G technology for both cases. The framework establishes the goals of privacy, preserving slice selection, serviceoriented anonymous authentication, and service-oriented key agreement. Summary: The NS paradigm is a means of simplifying complexities among heterogeneous networks by partitioning the network slices. The standards for NS are quite novel, and its integration into prevailing networks including MEC is in a questionable state. Even then, definition of a slice is a complex dilemma that should mitigate interoperability and compatibility concerns. Authentication among the NSIs lying in the same slice or among the slices is a challenge that should be commandeered by the NSM. In the MEC context, the edge platform acts as an intermediary in a considered slice extending from a UE to a cloud platform. Diverse security policies should be applicable for different slices, while an entity should trace the actions of NSIs for auditing purposes. MEC entities can be utilized to perform security, auditing, and monitoring functions.• Auditing and validation of NSIs: The NSIs that execute virtual functions or VMs should be audited and validated periodically to prevent VM-based attacks. • Security differentiation and slice isolation: Different security levels should be applied to network slices with adequate isolation so that the reach of the malicious agents is restricted. • Authentication framework: Ni et al. [122] proposed a service-oriented authentication framework to support NS in 5G-enabled IoT services. The proposed framework focuses on fog computing architecture for describing the authentication sequences. However, the deployment of network slices in the proposed framework is adaptable to both fog and MEC paradigms considering the resem-blance in the service structure in the access network entities, while the core network is served by the 5G technology for both cases. The framework establishes the goals of privacy, preserving slice selection, serviceoriented anonymous authentication, and service-oriented key agreement. Summary: The NS paradigm is a means of simplifying complexities among heterogeneous networks by partitioning the network slices. The standards for NS are quite novel, and its integration into prevailing networks including MEC is in a questionable state. Even then, definition of a slice is a complex dilemma that should mitigate interoperability and compatibility concerns. Authentication among the NSIs lying in the same slice or among the slices is a challenge that should be commandeered by the NSM. In the MEC context, the edge platform acts as an intermediary in a considered slice extending from a UE to a cloud platform. Diverse security policies should be applicable for different slices, while an entity should trace the actions of NSIs for auditing purposes.

        <p>The traffic steering of the MEC platform is conveyed by the Mp2 reference point (connection between the MEP and the data plane of the VI in a MEH). The configuration of the data plane is managed by the MEC platform, where it conveys traffic steering requests to Policy Control Function (PCF). PCF sends the corresponding traffic steering rules to the Session Management Function (SMF), where SMF handles the corresponding Protocol Data Unit (PDU) sessions [45] [73]. Moreover, Service Function Chaining (SFC) is a technique which facilitates the traffic steering policing adapting SDN and NFV constructs [127]. SFC forms the middleboxes (MBoxes) or Service Functions (SF) such as firewalls, Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) entities, Access Control Lists (ACLs), Intrusion Detection / Prevention Systems (IDS/ IPS) or Network Address Translation (NAT) [128]. As SDN and NFV are forming the MEC infrastructure for interconnecting the system level, host level, and access network, SFC is viable traffic steering technique for MEC deployments.

        <p>3) AR 3: Service Migration Service migration is the process of transferring executable content configured to offer a specific MES, either between edge levels or between cloud and the edge [18]. This process could expose unprecedented vulnerabilities and flaws in an MEC environment. In a CC-based service migration, services originally hosted at cloud environments are migrated to the edge servers located proximate to the mobile devices. This reduces latency and improves the capacity of the access network. Thus, as the services are executable programs, tools or software running on a virtualized platform, the code of that particular software should be migrated to the edge in such circumstances. There are four approaches being considered for code migration by Rodrigo et al. [25]: 1) migrating only part of the code; 2) migrating an exact replica or a clone of the entire execution environment with the memory and CPU images; 3) migrating mobile agents created by mobile devices to the edge; and 4) amalgamating process cloning and mobile agents at the edge. The MEC services are typically launched as VMs in the VI of MEHs. VM migration is conducted as either live or non-live approaches [19]. In a non-live migration, the entire VM with its running states are encapsulated and transferred to the migrating vicinity, while the local operation suspends completely. In live migration, VMs are orchestrating simultaneously at different edge platforms without suspension, while multiple VM migrations are plausible via Local Area Network (LAN) or Wide Area Network (WAN) coverage. Other than services, migrating computational processes are viable applications for MEC deployments where the network controller acts as the resource selector for utilizing the computation power. The computational migration models could be formulated using the Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem based on a random-walk mobility model or a thresholdbased model such as the Lyapunov optimization technique [17], [20].3) AR 3: Service Migration Service migration is the process of transferring executable content configured to offer a specific MES, either between edge levels or between cloud and the edge [18].

        <p>Vulnerabilities: The migration of services means migrating an entire serviceable platform or a part of it to the mobile edge hosts operating at the edge. Still, the security of the migration process is a grey area due to the diversity of utilized resources and the scope of the services. The migration process begins with a service operated within a single MEH or multiple MEHs. The unauthentic nature of the Internet-based connectivity among MEC edge entities poses security issues extending to VIM, UEs, and the migration data traversing channels [19].Vulnerabilities: The migration of services means migrating an entire serviceable platform or a part of it to the mobile edge hosts operating at the edge.

This leads to the exploitation of communication links between the edge service infrastructure and the cloud server or core network entities. • Attacks on mobile agents when migrating: In the case of employing mobile agents for service migration at the edge, the probability for an intrusion is higher as the code or the service platform migrated from the access network are subjected to threats under A1. Thus, it is imperative to secure the migration processes with proper security mechanisms for mitigating massive service manipulations at the edge of the MEC deployment regardless of the diversity of the services.

        <p>• Secure migration framework: Machen et al. [130] introduced a layered framework for migrating active services using VMs and containers implemented through 
            <rs type="software">KVM</rs> and LXC technologies, respectively. The proposed layers in the framework base, application, and instance support the MEC system for migrating a service from single MEC system level to another. The framework was tested using applications such as games, RAM simulations, video streaming, and face detection. The container-based model demonstrated peak performance. The authors, however, identified that the security risks are higher with containerbased implementations compared to VMs where the connectivity is solid while migrating. • Blockchain for securing migration: Wang et al. [18] suggest to employ Blockchain for resolving trust issues among entities on different domains while migrating. Summary: Migrating the services from one MEC-based eNB to another is a unique and required function in the Adapting mutual authentication among network slice and host network entities Authenticating NSMs Auditing and validating VM based slice instances Isolation and application of diversified security for different slices [122] Secure service oriented authentication framework [129] SFC based MEC architecture for SFs [128] Reactive security framework for wind farms [130] Layered Framework for VM and container migration [18] Employing Blockchain for establishing trust in migration [131] Dynamic tunneling method for PMIPv6 [132] PMIPv6 based security protocol for SH-IoT [133] Study on PLS random models for mobility MEC context. This phase can be identified as one of the weakest occurrences of edge computing in terms of security. Employing security is questionable for the migration channel due to the latency concerns in live migrations scenarios. As the channel itself conveys executable content, exposure could lead to impregnation of malicious agents into the edge infrastructure. Therefore, a security framework is a requirement to exploit the latency and security trade-off for maximizing efficiency. Further, Blockchain solutions can be employed for securing the states and credentials in the migration process.

        <p>The term 'mobility' can be described as maintaining the connectivity of a UE when roaming from a certain coverage area of a serving BS to another via a handover mechanism to maintain service continuity [16]. The coverage of a BS could vary from multiple macro BS, Small Cell BS (SCBS), Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) to standard RAN BSs. Thus, concerns are raised over security with different capacity BSs offering various coverage and handover models. In a mobile delegation circumstance, where a UE has offloaded its processing to the edge data centers in the previously serving BS, there are two scenarios in which the continuity is established: 1) VM migration where the current VM in the serving BS MEH would be migrated to the roamed BS MEH; 2) selection of a new communication path to the UE App and the serving MEH VM. Under this TV, those issues would be investigated to identify the best strategies to counter prevailing vulnerabilities under mobility scenarios.The term 'mobility' can be described as maintaining the connectivity of a UE when roaming from a certain coverage area of a serving BS to another via a handover mechanism to maintain service continuity [16].

A typical offloading task is different from a data offloading scenario. The raw data to be processed is conveyed to the MEC edge, while the ultimate decision, value, or classification is notified to the UE after the computation. The main benefits of mobile offloading are extension of the battery life of UEs, ability of users to employ sophisticated services that demands beyond their UE specifications, and improved capacity for storage within the edge infrastructure [16]. The intended outcomes of minimizing the energy consumption and offloading time (addition of transmission, execution, and receiving times) form a formidable problem model for offloading tasks in which the security is considered as a secondary goal.3) OTV3: Mobile Offloading Mobile offloading, or computational offloading, is the process of outsourcing heavy computing tasks, which are unfeasible to perform in the UE or the mobile device, to the edge environment [17].

The raw data to be processed is conveyed to the MEC edge, while the ultimate decision, value, or classification is notified to the UE after the computation. The main benefits of mobile offloading are extension of the battery life of UEs, ability of users to employ sophisticated services that demands beyond their UE specifications, and improved capacity for storage within the edge infrastructure [16]. The intended outcomes of minimizing the energy consumption and offloading time (addition of transmission, execution, and receiving times) form a formidable problem model for offloading tasks in which the security is considered as a secondary goal.</p>
        <p>Vulnerabilities: As security is a secondary goal of offloading, an extensive investigation into offloading schemes has not been conducted. There are issues with caching, authenticating the UE, and conveying credentials when offloading and retrieving the processed results. Offloading during a handover situation creates a complex scenario.Vulnerabilities: As security is a secondary goal of offloading, an extensive investigation into offloading schemes has not been conducted.

        <p>• Issues with caching / cache poisoning: The mobile offloading processes intended by the MEC edge deployments require caching functionality in the virtualization infrastructure. The multitude of UE Apps delegated to the edge demand extended caching spaces that would overrun the VM processor caching, resulting in service interruption and major latency. An adversary could target this vulnerability of the caching mechanism to launch cache poisoning attacks. Managing and monitoring the caches are intrinsic to the dynamic memory of the VI and ceasing any feasible attacks. • Authentication credentials: Ensuring the security of sensitive credentials used in authentication schemes established between the edge and mobile devices is imperative for eliminating exposure of the entire system. Compromised credentials grant the perpetrator the ability to launch spoofing, eavesdropping, and data manipulation attacks on the edge system. • Credential transmission: The credentials traversing from the edge to the core network are susceptible to intervening attacks due to the dispersed nature of the two networks. Thus, employing adequate levels of cryptic engagements in the communication channels, along with employing trust management schemes among entities operating on edge and the core, is critical to protecting the confidentiality and integrity of the secure credentials. Existing Solutions: The offloading problems are not only related to security, but also deal with energy, computational, and networking costs that improve the efficiency of the process. Thus, security solutions should be concerned with the efficiency of the offloading task.• Issues with caching / cache poisoning: The mobile offloading processes intended by the MEC edge deployments require caching functionality in the virtualization infrastructure.

        <p>Summary: Mobile or task offloading is one of the reasons for the existence of edge computing paradigms. Thus, there are a considerable number of offloading models proposed and perfected to balance energy and other costs while offloading the content towards the edge platform. For optimizing the energy while applying security, genetic algorithms can be employed. In addition, PLS models can be utilized for securing the offloading channels. However, development of the offloading function from the MEC edge platform perspective becomes complicated due to the engagement of the MEHs and its autonomous nature.Summary: Mobile or task offloading is one of the reasons for the existence of edge computing paradigms.

        <p>4) OTV4: Virtualization and Orchestration at the edge It is evident that edge computing paradigms are reliant on virtualization technologies for deployment. Virtualization offers a dynamic service provisioning functionality that could launch flexible and configurable softwarized executable instances at the edge platform. Prevailing virtualization approaches are combining hypervisor-based and light-weight virtualization technologies to form edge computing platforms [152]. Containers are deployed within a VM to attribute more dynamic governing capabilities. Even though hypervisor-based and container based methods provide an adequate level of isolation, a hybrid system might generate unintended problems that may affect security and performance. Moreover, there are a variety of orchestrating deployment options available, such as OpenNFV, CloudNFV, OpenBaton, Open MANO, Cloudify, and T-NOVA [3]. Interoperability and compatibility among these technologies are vital for creating a virtual ecosystem.4) OTV4: Virtualization and Orchestration at the edge It is evident that edge computing paradigms are reliant on virtualization technologies for deployment.

        <p>• Migration and offloading: A typical virtualized environment is isolated and operates within its boundaries in cloud computing. In MEC or any other edge computing scenarios however, service migration and offloading scenarios are imminent. In these approaches, an adversary could intercept the migration or offloading channel for eavesdropping, relaying, or impeding purposes. • VM based attacks: VM based attacks such as VNF location shift, VM manipulation, privileged escalation, VM sprawl, and VM escape are probable for intercepting the VMs [69]. • Less tolerant containerization: Lightweight virtualization approaches or containers are becoming popular for launching virtual platforms due to their flexibility and dynamic nature. However, they have a greater risk of intrusions than VMs due to their direct link with the kernel. Containers face issues internally for the isolation of processes, file system, network, device, and interprocess communication [153]. • Attacks on software and orchestrators: Softwarized attacks, along with SDN based attacks, can compromise the networking topology of the edge system.

        <p>• Security architectures / models: Wang et al. [147] proposed a novel security service architecture for SDN, contriving a security service orchestration center in the control plane. This security service maintains a rule engine that ensures threat mitigation in terms networkbased attacks towards the edge platforms. Sun et al. [148] proposed a security model called Security Protection of Live Migration (SPLM) for securing migration through security policy transfer and encryption. The proposed model consists of a Centralized Management Platform (CMP), virtual security gateway, security agent (SA), and hypervisor access engine entities, where the CMP and SA are performing the security functions. • Protection for container technology: Yasrab et al. [149] specified the mitigation policies for Docker (i.e. container technology) for attack vectors such as kernel exploits, DoS, container breakouts, poisoned images, MitM, and ARP spoofing. Further, access control policies and secure deployment guidelines are mentioned for enhancing docker execution. Jian et al. [150] proposed a defense mechanism for a Docker escape attack based on detected anomalous behaviour through namespaces. Summary: The lower risk tolerance of containerization technology, combined with the possibility of VM based attacks, extends the threat domains of the MEC edge platform. Further, vendor-based hypervisor specifications create compatibility issues among edge platforms that can be exploited by an adversary. These flaws can be exploited to impact the orchestrator entity at both edge and system levels. Therefore, securing container technologies is critical for virtual deployments.

        <p>1) Data Privacy:1) Data Privacy:</p>
        <p>The confidentiality of user data that is either stored, processed, or traversing is considered data privacy. Any mishandling of such private data is known as a privacy leakage. Enabling Big Data applications, facilitated with high bandwidth and ultra-low latency enhancements of MEC, will generate massive amounts of personal data in the future. Applications such as healthcare, banking, and crowd-sourcing are brimful of such sensitive data [157]. Moreover, a certain dataset of a user is disseminated to server placements administered among various telecom operators due to the open service platform of MEC. This poses a confidentiality issue. In the current era, Artificial Intelligence (AI) based pattern recognition techniques are applied on user data by certain companies to identify trends and interests. As these activities outsource data without user consent, privacy is violated conspicuously. Thus, the preservation of subscriber privacy is a vital concern for launching the MEC paradigm.The confidentiality of user data that is either stored, processed, or traversing is considered data privacy.

        <p>2) Location Privacy: Though Location Based Services (LBSs) enable various applications for MEC subscribers, exposure of the geolocation endangers the financial, entertainment, professional, and secrecy aspects of human life: hijacking, blackmailing, or ransoming situations are possible [158]. The user location could be revealed to the subscribed service legitimately either intentionally or unintentionally as a pop-up service request for location sharing, that the subscriber is consenting without proper assimilation, without the awareness of the consequences. Moreover, secondary mobile channels broadcasting the wireless transmission, apart from the direct channel, are bound for monitoring by eavesdroppers for tracking location [159]. These factors contribute to the violation of location privacy.2) Location Privacy: Though Location Based Services (LBSs) enable various applications for MEC subscribers, exposure of the geolocation endangers the financial, entertainment, professional, and secrecy aspects of human life: hijacking, blackmailing, or ransoming situations are possible [158].

        <p>3) Identity Privacy: Impending tactile Internet and IoT concepts are expanding the scope of the cyber-space. A method is needed to identify the billions of entities and people comprising it via interfacing UEs [157]. Any knowledge-based (username), possessionbased (Random Number Generator [RNG]), inherence-based (bio-metric) cyber-address-or Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) in case of UEs-is adoptable for proving one's identity. Identity is the key to safeguarding private information in the cyber-space. An adversary capable of replicating a user identity could access the entire data cluster mapped to that identity. Attacks such as UE tampering, UE cloning, and masquerading, which commit identity theft, are examples of privacy violations in the access network. In the core network, a cyber-invader capable of exposing identity credentials of the users or entities is presented with the opportunity to exploit the MEC system. Thus, preserving the identity of the users with expedient mechanisms is a principal requisite for MEC deployments.3) Identity Privacy: Impending tactile Internet and IoT concepts are expanding the scope of the cyber-space.

        <p>4) Authorized and Curious Adversaries: An authorized entity that captures disowned data with an honest and curious intent could exist. The extracted data could then be used for usage profiling, location tracking, and disclosing credentials [25]. Thus, user privacy is violated regardless of the motive of the intruder. Such an initiative can be taken by the infrastructure or a third-party service provider that subscribes to an MES. Due to the openness of the edge ecosystem, constricting these legitimate practices is a conundrum. Every entity engaging with the ecosystem should be aware of their responsibility. Moreover, a mechanism should exist to detect any misbehaviour perpetrated by an entity or a user.4) Authorized and Curious Adversaries: An authorized entity that captures disowned data with an honest and curious intent could exist.

        <p>5) Computational Offloading: Computational offloading is an exploitable feature of MEC system that could be monitored by the adversaries to determine the location information [160]. Tracking such intervening attacks are questionable due to the complexity of the offloading process and non-accountability of the attack origination. Moreover, MEC servers inherit the features to track the usage patterns of the subscribers from the contextual information and channel status parameters. This creates a distinct concern with subscribers with respect to their private information [159]. Thus, computational offloading is a feature that risks the privacy of the MEC system.5) Computational Offloading: Computational offloading is an exploitable feature of MEC system that could be monitored by the adversaries to determine the location information [160]. Tracking such intervening attacks are questionable due to the complexity of the offloading process and non-accountability of the attack origination. Moreover, MEC servers inherit the features to track the usage patterns of the subscribers from the contextual information and channel status parameters. This creates a distinct concern with subscribers with respect to their private information [159]. Thus, computational offloading is a feature that risks the privacy of the MEC system.</p>
        <p>Migrating services from one MEH to another at the same edge level or at another edge level is possibly dependent on the scope of the subscribed service and the mobility of the UE. Certain services such as AR or autonomous vehicles demand service migration in order to satisfy service requirements. Thus, a cyber-eavesdropper capable of reviewing the service statistics of the MEH entities is in a position to track the user from the migrating service patterns [158], leading to a violation of location and usage pattern privacy aspects. This vulnerability exists with compromised MEC entities that could monitor service statistics of the VI platform.Migrating services from one MEH to another at the same edge level or at another edge level is possibly dependent on the scope of the subscribed service and the mobility of the UE.

Depending on the specifications of the device, the provided level of privacy guarantees also varies (i.e., a high-end device gets better assurance than a low-end device). Thus, it is vital for MESs to publish the minimum specification requirements for ensuring the guaranteed privacy level.6) O6 -Declaring minimum specification requisites of UE for subscribing MESs Heterogeneous IoT devices subscribing to MEC services inherit varying resources.

        <p>As offloading becomes a common occurrence with MEC, the privacy of the data being conveyed towards the edge infrastructure is a concern addressed above. In 2017, He et al. studied the location privacy and usage pattern privacy of the MEC task-offloading feature [159]. The paper investigated the balance to restore privacy protection while maintaining maximized operational delay and energy consumption performance. A Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) based scheduling algorithm was proposed as an approach to the task offloading process. CMDPs offer a better outcome compared to Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) due to their capability of applying multiple actions via cost parameters, thereby leading to better specification of the model. As most IoT-based privacy discussions are focused on conventional cloud computing deployments, He et al. [160] (2018) identify novel vulnerabilities in MEC-enabled IoT deployments from the wireless offloading feature. An adversary model is formed considering an untrusted/compromised service provider that monitors the UE and MEC server engagements for revealing the location of the UE employing estimation techniques. This offloading problem is formed using MDP. The privacy-aware solution is introduced as a deep Post-Decision State (PDS) learning process formulated by integrating PDS and Deep Q-Network (DQN) techniques that utilize energy-harvesting statistics. The deep PDS approach suggests an offloading strategy to the IoT device faster than the DQN method. Though the offloading scheme follows MDP in contrast to CMDP in the previous solution, the deep PDS strategy is proving viable due to its extended experience-storing feature that converges to a faster outcome to overcome the lapses in the scheduling algorithm.As offloading becomes a common occurrence with MEC, the privacy of the data being conveyed towards the edge infrastructure is a concern addressed above.

        <p>In this approach, data or devices that include information are partitioned into various layers where different privacy preserving techniques can be applied effectively. Chi et al. [161] introduced a novel technique called privacy partitioning which composed a trusted local partition and untrusted remote partition. The proposed method targets privacy preservation of deep learning classification tasks employed in mobile offloading processes. The bipartite topology based on threat modelling and interactive adversarial deep networks is adopted for modelling the threat domain. The intention of the proposed framework is to attenuate the access capacity of the attackers exploiting the internal states of the deep network.In this approach, data or devices that include information are partitioned into various layers where different privacy preserving techniques can be applied effectively.

The extent of the resources required to extract, store, process, and retrieve such a volume creates doubts over the adaptability of privacy preserving mechanisms. Du et al. [162] proposed a privacy preserving method that aims to maximize the query accuracy and minimize the privacy leakage probability for big data and heterogeneous IoT applications. A machine learning-based differential privacy method is adopted by aggregating Laplacian random noise in an output perturbation process. Another method called objective perturbation is employed for forming an objective function to aggregate noise. The amount of noise is dependent on the sensitivity of data. The experimental results suggest that the privacy preserving is feasible with accurate data retrieval.3) Mitigating privacy leakages in big data: Big data is the representation of an extremely large amount of data that cannot be processed by conventional processing techniques.

He et al. [158] proposed a chaff service based approach to preserve the user privacy. In their work, the chaff service is launched by the user or the MEC platform for confusing the eavesdropper. The eavesdropper is modelled as a maximum likelihood detector, while several chaff control strategies are considered for formulating the model. Robustness analysis is conducted for each strategy for determining the defence strategy. Employing chaff services are expensive for the service platform. Thus, the authors conclude that deploying the proposed method should be a second line of defence.4) Chaff service based privacy preserving: Chaff services are launched to confuse the adversary by distracting its focus towards the chaff process, while legitimate services are running simultaneously, obfuscated from the attacker.

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), bilinear pairings, and complexity assumptions are employed for forming the mutual authentication scheme for MEC subscribers. A security analysis and computational cost evaluation are conducted by the authors for proving its applicability.

Data retrieval is only possible at the PCC by possessing the private key. This three-entity system model employs a Bilinear map of composite order groups, and Boneh-Goh-Nissim cryptosystem that inherits homomorphic properties. Five main phases, initialization, registration, encryption, aggregation, and decryption, ensure the privacy of user data traversed from TDs to the PCC.A model for preserving privacy in IoT enabled MEC deployments was proposed by Li et al.

A model is formulated incorporating two BSs within a RAN. Privacy is quantified as a factor cohesive of mobile entity actual location and observed location from peer nodes. The security of the proposed model is examined in terms of anonymity, unlinkability, untraceability, repudiation, and confidentiality. Simulations result in a higher value for the location privacy metric, while performance is visualized as the highest value with least operational cost for MEC and MSS amalgamation.The allowance for higher mobility in future 5G networks creates challenges to ensure the privacy of users due to dynamic network configurations.

The research problems from each previous section/subsection have been identified, and a summary of preliminary solutions is given. The presented insights align with the future directives proposed by emerging research for recognizing the potential for deploying MEC. A. Threat Vectors 1) Access Network Lessons Learned: Technological heterogeneity is the salient inherence of an access network that raises concerns over the deployment scenarios of MEC in terms of scalability and security. Numerous wireless mobile communication technologies, ad-hoc technologies, and technologies engaged with UEs indicated in Section III are manifesting the interoperability and compatibility conundrums of the access network. The extent of RAN coverage and other non-3GPP technologies is confined in MEC due to the migration of storage and processing infrastructure to the edge network compared with prevailing CC deployments. However, this partition of the MEC deployment is the most vulnerable to intrusion or interveningbased security attacks. Thus, meeting confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements is paramount to forming security protocols in the access technologies. Achieving a holistic and generic security solution, however, is inconceivable due to diverse access technologies in this domain.This section provides a concise explanation of insights gained from the survey in terms of security and privacy of MEC systems, as depicted in Fig. 5.

        <p>Security is a prominent investigative topic among research efforts in the access network domain. Thus, various security solutions are proposed-either generic or specific to certain applicable scenarios, though security solutions focused on MEC access network deployments are inconspicuous. In terms of the users or subscribers, measures for securing privacy should be initially launched in the hardware, firmware, and software of the UE to maximize threat mitigation. This enables a first line of defense for sensitive credentials stored in the UE. From the insights we gained from this survey, we gathered that lesser work was focused on solving security issues in UEs. Moreover, employed security mechanisms should be aware of the resource consumption of the UEs to utilize battery life.

        <p>Security of the UEs, gateways, or networking devices engaged in a local networking domain that connect to a MEC edge level is not addressed significantly, according to the current research findings. This is a vital research direction to be considered in the future for developing malicious entity detection, anomalous pattern detection, measures for predicting threat vectors through autonomous threat assessment, and self-healing mechanisms. MEC-enabled mobile delegation approaches for computational task offloading confirm the requirement of a solid security scheme embedded in UE. These offloading mechanisms enable the adversaries to intercept the offloading channels for either retrieving information or injecting malicious content to exploit the edge level entities. Thus, investigating the applicability of mechanisms such as homomorphism and blockchain for securing the offloading protocols-and the development of integrity assurance scenarios for detecting probable violations, while satisfying the transmission efficiency of the communication channel-is an impending directive towards realizing MEC. The diversity among the Operating Systems (OSs) of UEs is forcing the MEC enablers for establishing a generic construct when engaging them. OS and firmware updating strategies are vulnerable to exploitation due to their various inherent security levels. Thus, a minimum level of security policies should be standardized by the ETSI for subscribing MEC services. Finally, as for the GDPR compliance of privacy preservation mechanisms and objectives specified in Section V for MEC enabled UE device-their firmware and software is an achievement for the future.Security of the UEs, gateways, or networking devices engaged in a local networking domain that connect to a MEC edge level is not addressed significantly, according to the current research findings.

        <p>The mobile edge network is the most integral environment of the entire MEC system because of its uniqueness compared to other edge computing paradigms. In contrast, featured technological and device heterogeneity is lesser than the access network. Thus, threats are limited to the comprised MEC architectural components (E1, E2, and E3) and the connections between them (E4, E5, E6, and E7), as illustrated in Fig. 4. However, proximity to the access network elevates the risks of the principal storage and processing platforms of MEC, which adversaries are capable of exploiting. Assuming the physical accessibility to edge level entities is prevented by enforcing intrinsic restrictions, the threats to the mobile edge network could be categorized into three approaches: virtualization protocols targeted attacks (E1, E2, and E3), malicious infiltrations (E1, E2, E3, and E4), and intervening attacks (E5, E6, and E7). In terms of the entities, MEH is the most vulnerable container that stores the traversed data from the access network. ME Apps facilitate an executable platform for malicious agents obscured in the MEH databases. Moreover, seamless operation of the edge network is entirely reliant on the MEH resource utilization and service provisioning.The mobile edge network is the most integral environment of the entire MEC system because of its uniqueness compared to other edge computing paradigms.

        <p>Virtualization and VM-based service deployments are the key enablers of the holistic MEC system. The edge level of the MEC architecture is more reliant on virtual storage and processing infrastructures. Implementing such a virtual environment could be attained via VMs or containers. The containers operate through the utilization of the underlying OS kernel virtualization, while VMs are implemented by hardware virtualization that forms an isolated execution platform with a distinguished OS in each VM [19].

        <p>In retrospect on virtualization technologies, a proper mechanism should be investigated for launching the virtualization platform of MEHs. As explained above, the choice of technology deviates between containers and VMs. The selection criteria should consider efficiency and support for migration, mobility, scalability, and security. VM technologies should employ security measures in their protocols for preventing the addressed attacks. A DMZ approach is a viable scheme for distinguishing security levels in accordance with the priority of the service. In order to negate the effect of malicious activities in the edge, a Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) method could be employed for analyzing the VM hard disk offline for detecting malicious agents [171]. The direct detection of malicious agents from scanning the virtual hard drive is only applicable to the cases of known signatures. Thus, monitoring the usage statistics of memory, storage, network, and hardware is an indirect approach to inspect uncharacteristic behavior of ME Apps. The monitoring agent could be deployed as a part of the hypervisor or as an external entity that operates within or externally to the VM [172]. A direct communicating link, however, should exist between the hypervisor and the monitoring agent in case of external monitoring. Utilizing machine learning techniques provides a unique opportunity for VMI processes to enhance their detection accuracy and reliability as presented in [173].In retrospect on virtualization technologies, a proper mechanism should be investigated for launching the virtualization platform of MEHs.

        <p>The separation of the core network or the system level from the edge network guarantees a significant security assurance for the orchestration entities in the MEC system from malicious content as they navigate the edge network for storage and processing. However, the connectivity between the system level and the edge level entities is critical for the initiation and termination of MESs and ME Apps. Once the MES is approved by the OSS, continuation of the process does not require ubiquitous connectivity to the system level until its termination. The MEO, however, maintains an overall perception of the edge level virtual resource allocation through the VIM. This bi-directional channel is critical to the security perspective due to its capability to detect resource depletion attacks, which are the most probable type of attacks at the MEC system level. Additionally, VM-based exploits are probable on MEO. The service log registry and the troubleshooting mechanism of the MEO are salient for the hypervisor operation.The separation of the core network or the system level from the edge network guarantees a significant security assurance for the orchestration entities in the MEC system from malicious content as they navigate the edge network for storage and processing.

        <p>UALCMP is a critical entity in MEC structure for two reasons: one is the ingress portal to the entire MEC system, while the other is for maintaining the internal addressing scheme for MESs and ME Apps launched at several edge levels under its control. Thus, perpetual functioning of the UALCMP is paramount to the seamless operation of the MEC service platforms, as it acts as a single point of failure. The access capacity of UALCMP, however, could be upgraded as it is located in the core network. Though the addressing (proxy) and the service request handling functions should be isolated to cater parallel processing systems, which persist in executing, even if one system (request handling system) is disrupted. Similarly, the factors applicable to UALCMP are recurrent for CFSP, which performs request handling for thirdparty services provisioned by the MEC infrastructure owner. The approval process, however, should be stern compared with UALCMP, as they are high-level services demanding elevated aggregate of resources and accessibility. The current research does not address guided methodologies to establish invulnerable SLAs or proxy functionality applicable to both UALCMP and CFSP entities. The legitimacy of the UE Apps or services requesting the MEC subscriptions are a vital concern due to malicious intents of the adversaries. Either UALCMP, CFSP, or the OSS entities do not inherit the functionality to evaluate the authenticity of the services requesting access to the system. Thus, an authority should exist to attest the services for prevention of inserting malicious content and masquerading attempts towards the MEC system. The standardization of the interfacing 5G core network and the MEC system level entities is imperative for realizing the MEC as a pragmatic solution that has been developed as an extended mobile solution.

The introspection mechanisms should feature higher scalability and responsiveness in contrast to the edge level VMI systems. These introspection mechanisms are to be independent of the regular orchestration processes conducted by the MEO. Thus, a separate processing platform should be integrated into it. A TPM is a novel method for validating VNFs employing hardware utilization statistics [69]. The Direct Anonymous Attestation with Attributes (DAA-A) and the TPM 2.0 are two such approaches [25]. Recently published patent on TPM, referred in [178], is suggesting various integration options to MEC system for validating the integrity of virtual processes. Remote attestation is another technique proposed by researches for validating the trust status of a NFV based process remotely.

        <p>Apart from the attestation techniques applicable to VNFs operated in a virtual environment, the concept could be extended to UE Apps and MESs. An authority, acting as a Trusted Third Party (TTP) that validates the service requests forwarded to the UALCMP or CFSP of the MEC system level, would unburden the system with legitimacy concerns. Such authorities are capable of acting remotely as the Certificate circumspectly. Various edge levels of MEC might not inherit similar proportions of specifications due to the demand based resource provisioning of mobile networks. Thus, resource availability for the migrating service or application at the migrated MEC edge level is an obvious issue. A mobile UE App is either connected to a cloned VM or the preceding VM connected via the roaming network. In this case, timing and impersonation attacks are probable during a mobility handover. VNF-based location shift attacks are a common occurrence in this scenario. Moreover, a botnet-based attack utilizing numerous infected UE devices to emanate virtual Mobility Management Entities (vMMEs) in the NFVI based edge platform results in DDoS repercussions [69].

        <p>Lessons Learned: MEC architecture provides improved assurance for users regarding their sensitive data compared with cloud computing. Location and context awareness are key factors for MEC subscribers to uphold their trust in Location Based Services (LBSs).

        <p>The EU's GDPR legislation [167] formed a compliance initiative for privacy awareness within the EU domain, which can be extended to the globe. Offloading-based privacy ensuring mechanisms are proposed in the literature [159], [160] that employ MDP-based scheduling for optimizing energy consumption with applied security. Privacy partitioning [161] is a novel approach utilized for applying different privacy mechanisms on various partitions. Privacy models and protocols proposed in [163], [164] could be adopted for the MEC system to ensure anonymity and identity of subscribers. Blockchain [166] is another reliable and trustworthy technology envisioned to be adopted for privacy models. However, solid MEC-based privacy solutions have not been implemented yet due to the lack of standardization in the MEC context.

SDP is focused on solving the privacy violations of intra-host attacks, transborder data flow, unencrypted archived data, data leakages, and data access violations. Addressed privacy concerns, as they resemble the predicaments in MEC, envision SDP integration to MEC for privacy preservation. Privacy by Design (PbD) is a preemptive strategy proposed in case of assuring privacy is no longer sufficient with formed regulations [189]. The concept was formalized by seven foundational principles to be integrated throughout the entire design process [190]. This is a preferable starting point for IoT device manufacturers to guarantee privacy for their subscribers. Enabling privacy mechanisms in VM-based operations is a directive vital for MEC system, due to its wide adaptation of virtual processing platforms. A checkpointing approach to monitor the status of VM operation is capable of achieving that aspect [191].

        <p>C. Future Technologies to enhance security in MEC 1) Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) AI, ML, and Deep Learning (DL) approaches combined with data mining are frequently utilized for static/dynamic malware analysis and anomaly detection in the current information systems [192]. It is evident that adversaries possessing legitimate credentials pose a significant threat to the MEC system, where the critical operations are autonomous and virtualized [47]. The heterogeneity of IoT devices requesting the MES subscriptions might deceive the ingress entities, such as UALCMP and CFSP. Once the approval is granted, malicious executable content could effectively exploit the system, resulting in repercussions to the entire system. Thus, detecting the anomalous behaviour of ME Apps operating in MEHs is a paramount necessity. DL methods are ideal for such detection. Employing AI and ML approaches guarantee a softwarized security mechanisms to be deployed with 5G related technologies in conjunction with MEC such as NFV, SDN, ICN, and NS [193]. Moreover, honeypots deployed with AI and ML platforms act as cyber defenders for deceiving the attackers [54], [192].C.

        <p>2) Reinforcement Learning (RL) RL is a technique inspired by behavioral psychology for making decisions with continuous feedback extracted from the surrounding environment [194]. This method is different from its predecessor ML, as RL fails to learn from data-it is intended for learning from the experience. The main operation of a RL scheme is to maximize the cumulative reward at different states of the system from a suitable action. MDP is used as the typical mathematical formulation of RL, while Q-Learning method is ideal for exploring an optimum action on a MDP environment through trial and error. RL is adaptable to MEC intelligent offloading schemes [195]. From a security perspective, RL techniques enable IoT devices to select the optimal security protocols based on experience, which is more effective than learning methods based on data [196]. Thus, RL provides a distinct autonomous security solution for MEC deployments.2) Reinforcement Learning (RL) RL is a technique inspired by behavioral psychology for making decisions with continuous feedback extracted from the surrounding environment [194].

In order to evaluate the compatibility of the application to the microservice architecture, a pattern language is used. However, the microservice architecture does not simplify the process. It disseminates the application logic into multiple smaller components, resulting in a much more complex network interaction model between components [201]. In the context of MEC, UE Apps and ME Apps could be seen as microservices. As these microservices are linked with each other for realizing various processes involved in the MEC operation, the security could be employed as a service.

Since MEC proposes to move cloud computing features to the edge, blockchain will be important in the MEC domain as well. Specifically, blockchain can fuel the integration of MEC and IoT to 5G, by offering higher level of security and privacy [206]. There are some research works related to blockchain based Fog systems to improve the security and privacy along with resource and energy management [207], [208].

        <p>The attributed features of the MEC paradigm-imparted by the serviceable platform launched at the edge of the mobile network-improve the realization of 5G and its impending use cases. The existing literature covers the aspects of communication, offloading, service migration, and IoT integration of the nascent MEC paradigm in a significant manner, considering its novelty and contemporary development in terms of standardization. However, security and privacy considerations are not investigated comprehensively in other work. Thus, this survey addressed the security and privacy aspects of the MEC paradigm in relation to the ETSI standards to direct the research communities on the path towards a feasible MEC deployment. In order to forecast the security vulnerabilities in the MEC system, revealing the threat vectors (TVs) of the entire architecture in addition to the classical security requirements is a cardinal requisite. We considered an MEC deployment scenario which expanded to two edge / host levels governed by a single MEC system level to identify and present TVs. The classified TVs into four categories: Access, Edge, Core, and Architectural, depending on their vector location and functioning. Furthermore, TVs that cannot be classified under the previous 4 cases were specified as other TVs. Plausible attack vectors were drawn from the identified TVs, while countermeasures were proposed from the prevailing literature. The privacy aspect of MEC is a vital contribution of this survey, which outlines the privacy enhancements that are possible with MEC architecture. We established privacy preservation objectives/goals for MEC after studying privacy concerns inherited by the MEC deployments. Moreover, the future directives that extend to diverse avenues of MECenabled technologies were also presented. Due to variant security vulnerabilities revealed from this survey, it is evident that proposing a universal security solution for the holistic system is improbable. Thus, intricate differences could be mitigated in employing security and privacy preservation mechanisms specific to each unique MEC use case.The attributed features of the MEC paradigm-imparted by the serviceable platform launched at the edge of the mobile network-improve the realization of 5G and its impending use cases.

        <p>The NS concept is still in its inception stages, in terms of standardization for supporting heterogeneous services, though integration of NS concept to MEC deployments is imminent. Thus, identifying the MEC components capable of performing the functions perpetrated by NS functional entities is a goal for the future. 5G core network components, however, are already mapped with a published 5G network-slicing architecture [124]. Incompatibility of different slices to communicate to each other is a major concern for NSIs. If NSIs are represented by MEHs in the MEC system, incompatibility could be mitigated with the generic virtual protocol adaptation. Integrating the NS MANO formation into the MEC system level is probable with the MEC-NFV MANO integration achieved elsewhere [31]. In terms of security, impersonation attacks are plausible, due to the inadequacy of mutual-authentication schemes within inter-slice entities.

        <p>• How to establish communication between network slices securely? Preliminary Solutions: Authentication is a key mechanism that appears in multiple instances of NS applications due to its diverse technology dispersed into many slices. Thus, an authentication framework [122] is a necessity to conduct access control for a holistic NS-based network. Furthermore, proper slice isolation [180] is leading to counter many security attacks perpetrated at NSIs.

        <p>Future Directives: Mapping the NS architectural layers: business (slice management), NS service instance (out of eMBB, eMTC, and URCC services), NS instance (VNF slices), and resource (NFVI based radio, network, storage, and computing) layers to the MEC architecture is critical for realizing the integration of these two concepts [124]. The protocols should be standardized to enable inter-slice communication among NSIs with embedded security mechanisms. The interfaces should be varied for diverse slice interaction in UEs for restricting the shifting ability from one slice to another. This will require the users to authenticate themselves with varied credentials to improve the security in inter-slice communication. Implementing a security function in each slice with adequate level of isolation leads to safeguarding privacy in addition to security [181]. An approach, as proposed elsewhere [126], to enhance the robustness of NS from an algorithm for slice recovery and reconfiguration is a novel initiative to counter invalidating flaws in inter-slice communication. A viable network slice selection mechanism, as patented in [182], is a major requirement for deploying NS in an MEC-enabled environment.Future Directives: Mapping the NS architectural layers: business (slice management), NS service instance (out of eMBB, eMTC, and URCC services), NS instance (VNF slices), and resource (NFVI based radio, network, storage, and computing) layers to the MEC architecture is critical for realizing the integration of these two concepts [124].

        <p>The MEC paradigm is formed combining the edge computing concept with mobile technologies, where traffic is steered utilizing mobile network-based components. MEC-generated traffic steered from UE to the edge and core networks are orchestrated by 5G core network entities such as PCF and SMF NFs. The LADN of the MEH is directly communicating with the UPF NF to enforce steering policies. As the majority of MEC-based traffic is traversed via the mobile network, engagement of the 5G entities is imminent. Thus, the security of traffic steering processes is dependent on these core network entities and their protocols. A merger between SDN and NFV technologies is envisioned to form the networking infrastructure of MEC. Thus, SFC is a method that elaborates the potential for adapting in MEC traffic steering constructs, as it is based on SDN and NFV. However, traffic steering security is not considered significantly.The MEC paradigm is formed combining the edge computing concept with mobile technologies, where traffic is steered utilizing mobile network-based components.

        <p>Future Directives: SFC is a technique to be further investigated for its adaptability to MEC systems. However, standardizing the 5G core network entities interfacing specifications with the MEC components is critical for proposing pragmatic security solutions. The patent [183] explicates a traffic steering scenario in wireless communication that conveys assisting information from the eNodeB via a dedicated signaling channel. This method is optimal for MEC-enabled UEs to steer the traffic through a less occupied channel, optimizing the holistic traffic profile of the serving BS. Traffic steering methods such as load aware and heterogeneous mechanisms are proposed as viable options for MEC deployment [184]. In terms of security, Soft-VPMS-based adaptation to the networking infrastructure of the MEC system represents great potential for traffic steering management.Future Directives: SFC is a technique to be further investigated for its adaptability to MEC systems.

        <p>c) Service Migration Lessons Learned: Versatility to migrate a service from one functioning infrastructure to another is a feature that improves the realization of MEC in the current heterogeneous IoT market, which solves the demand for a ubiquitous connectivity to service access in a geographically dispersed context. Maintaining the service continuity subject to mobility-based 5G guarantees, however, challenges the deployment of migrating schemes for operating seamlessly [18]. A particular migration process might range from traversal of a single executable file to a cloning of an entire serviceable platform. Thus, a proper scheduling mechanism that confiscates a recording scheme for state logs is a major requirement. In addition, suspensions during the migration process are inevitable due to connectivity failures, bandwidth restrictions, or intended service disruption attacks perpetrated by adversaries. The resumption of service and retrieval of stateful logs are entirely reliant on the scheduling mechanism. Moreover, scheduling mechanisms that embed migration protocols are critical for ensuring security and restoring the service in an unintended intermittent circumstance.c) Service Migration Lessons Learned: Versatility to migrate a service from one functioning infrastructure to another is a feature that improves the realization of MEC in the current heterogeneous IoT market, which solves the demand for a ubiquitous connectivity to service access in a geographically dispersed context.

        <p>The migration process is dependent on the virtualization technology (i.e., either containers or VMs [19]). Containers are lightweight in comparison to VMs that are best suited for resource scarce environments. The reason for convenience is also the pitfall of containers on self-reliance in the perspective of migration, due to the requirement of OS libraries to operate on a migrated environment. VMs are capable of executing on any host due to the migration of the entire executable constructs onto the foreign vicinity. Thus, establishing security protocols on container based deployments are restricted from the resource availability and compatibility of the local and migrating service platforms.The migration process is dependent on the virtualization technology (i.e., either containers or VMs [19]).
