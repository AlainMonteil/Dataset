        <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) has been rapidly evolving towards making a greater impact on everyday life to large industrial systems. Unfortunately, this has attracted the attention of cybercriminals who made IoT a target of malicious activities, opening the door to a possible attack on the end nodes. To this end, Numerous IoT intrusion detection Systems (IDS) have been proposed in the literature to tackle attacks on the IoT ecosystem, which can be broadly classified based on detection technique, validation strategy, and deployment strategy. This survey paper presents a comprehensive review of contemporary IoT IDS and an overview of techniques, deployment Strategy, validation strategy and datasets that are commonly applied for building IDS. We also review how existing IoT IDS detect intrusive attacks and secure communications on the IoT. It also presents the classification of IoT attacks and discusses future research challenges to counter such IoT attacks to make IoT more secure. These purposes help IoT security researchers by uniting, contrasting, and compiling scattered research efforts. Consequently, we provide a unique IoT IDS taxonomy, which sheds light on IoT IDS techniques, their advantages and disadvantages, IoT attacks that exploit IoT communication systems, corresponding advanced IDS and detection capabilities to detect IoT attacks.The Internet of Things (IoT) has been rapidly evolving towards making a greater impact on everyday life to large industrial systems.

        <p>Internet of Things (IoT) are interconnected systems of devices that facilitate seamless information exchange between physical devices. These devices could be medical and healthcare devices, driverless vehicles, industrial robots, smart TVs, wearables and smart city infrastructures; and they can be remotely monitored and regulated. IoT devices are expected to become more prevalent than mobile devices and will have access to the most sensitive information, such as personal information. This will result in increasing attack surface area and probabilities of attacks will increase. As security will be a vital supporting element of most IoT applications, IoT intrusion detection systems need also be developed to secure communications enabled by such IoT technologies (Granjal et al., 2015).Internet of Things (IoT) are interconnected systems of devices that facilitate seamless information exchange between physical devices.

        <p>In the last few years, advancement in Artificial Intelligent (AI) such as machine learning and deep learning techniques has been used to improve IoT IDS (Intrusion Detection System). The current requirement is to do an up-to-date, thorough taxonomy and critical review of this recent work. Numerous related studies applied different machine learning and deep learning techniques through various datasets to validate the development of IoT IDS. But, it's still not clear that which dataset, machine learning or deep learning techniques are more effective for building an efficient IoT IDS. Secondly, the time consumed in building and testing IoT IDS is not considered in the evaluation of some IDSs techniques, despite being a critical factor for the effectiveness of 'online' IDSs (Khraisat et al., 2019a).In the last few years, advancement in Artificial Intelligent (AI) such as machine learning and deep learning techniques has been used to improve IoT IDS (Intrusion Detection System).

        <p>During the last few years, several surveys on IoT IDS have been published. Table 1 shows the IDS techniques and datasets covered by this survey and previous survey papers. The comparison that in this table discusses the contributions of each survey related to the develop intrusion detection system for IoT. The survey on intrusion detection systems and taxonomy by Axelsson (Axelsson, 2000) classified intrusion detection systems based on the detection methods. The highly cited survey by Debar et al. (Debar et al., 2000) surveyed detection methods based on the behaviour and knowledge profiles of the attacks. A taxonomy of IoT intrusion systems by Liao et al.

        <p>The highly cited survey by Alvarenga et al. (Zarpelao et al., 2017) reviews the IoT security issues in general. Attacks against IoT devices are not discussed in their studies, such as Denial of Service (DoS) Attack and attack on RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks). Critical Infrastructure such as power systems, transport, the internet, air traffic control, railways and power plants could all be disrupted by an IoT attacker. The authors reviewed intrusion detection in IoT, and they presented a great taxonomy to classify the IoT IDSs based on detection method, IDS placement strategy, and security threat and validation strategy. It was also indicated by Alvarenga et al. (Zarpelao et al., 2017) in 2017 that intrusion detection for IoT is still in an initial stage and that the existing IDSs do not enough for a wide variety of IoT attacks. This paper explored and discussed if the recent IoT IDSs are enough to deal with different IoT attacks.The highly cited survey by Alvarenga et al.

        <p>IoT Intrusion is defined as an unauthorised action or activity that harms the IoT ecosystem. In other words, an attack that results in any kind of damage to the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information is considered an intrusion. For example, an attack that will make the computer services unavailable to its legitimate users is considered an intrusion. An IDS is defined as a software or hardware system that maintains the security of the system by identifying malicious activities on the computer systems (Liao et al., 2013a). The main aim of IDS is to identify unauthorised computer usage and malicious network traffic which is not possible while using a traditional firewall. This results in making the computer systems highly protective against the malicious actions that compromise the availability, integrity, or confidentiality of computer systems. IDS system has two main sub-categories: Signature-based Intrusion Detection System (SIDS) and Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection System (AIDS).IoT Intrusion is defined as an unauthorised action or activity that harms the IoT ecosystem.

        <p>Signature intrusion detection systems (SIDS) utilize pattern matching techniques to find a known attack; these are also known as Knowledge-based Detection or Misuse Detection (Khraisat et al., 2018). In SIDS, matching methods are used to find a previous intrusion. In other words, when an intrusion signature matches the signature of a previous intrusion that already exists in the signature database, an alarm signal is triggered. For SIDS, the host's logs are inspected to find sequences of commands or actions which have previously been identified as malware. SIDS has also been labelled in the literature as Knowledge-Based Detection or Misuse Detection (Modi et al., 2013).Signature intrusion detection systems (SIDS) utilize pattern matching techniques to find a known attack; these are also known as Knowledge-based Detection or Misuse Detection (Khraisat et al., 2018).

        <p>Figure 2 demonstrates the conceptual working of SIDS approaches. The main idea is to build a database of intrusion signatures and to compare the current set of activities against the existing signatures and raise the alarm if a match is found. For example, a rule in the form of "if: antecedent -then: consequent" may lead to "if (source IP address=destination IP address) then label as an attack ".Figure 2 demonstrates the conceptual working of SIDS approaches.

        <p>SIDS usually gives an excellent detection accuracy for previously known intrusions (Kreibich &amp; Crowcroft, 2004). However, SIDS is unable to detect zero-day attacks as the database does not contain a matching signature until the signature of the new attack is extracted and stored. SIDS is employed in a number of common tools, such as 
            <rs type="software">Snort</rs> (Roesch, 1999) and 
            <rs type="software">NetSTAT</rs> (Vigna &amp; Kemmerer, 1999).
        </p>
        <p>Traditional methods of SIDS have difficulty in identifying attacks that span multiple packets as they examine network packets and perform matching against a database of signatures. With the increased sophistication of modern malware, extracting signature information from multiple packets may be required. With this, IDS needs to bring the contents of earlier packets as well. For creating a signature for SIDS, generally, there have been several methods where signatures are created as state machines (Meiners et al., 2010), formal language string patterns or semantic conditions (Lin et al., 2011).Traditional methods of SIDS have difficulty in identifying attacks that span multiple packets as they examine network packets and perform matching against a database of signatures.

        <p>With the increasing rate of zero-day attacks (Symantec, 2017), SIDS techniques have become progressively less effective because of the absence of signature for any such attacks. The other factors such as the polymorphic variants of the malware and the rising amount of targeted attacks also add up in compromising the adequacy of this traditional model. A potential solution to this problem would be to use AIDS techniques. AIDS works by differentiating between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour rather than profiling what is anomalous, as described in the next section, as described in the next section.With the increasing rate of zero-day attacks (Symantec, 2017), SIDS techniques have become progressively less effective because of the absence of signature for any such attacks.

        <p>AIDS has attracted a lot of scholars because of its feature to overcome the limitation of SIDS. In AIDS, a normal model of the behavior of a computer system is created using machine learning, statistical-based or knowledge-based methods. Any significant deviation between the observed behavior and the model is regarded as an anomaly, which can be interpreted as an intrusion. This kind of technique works on the fact that malicious behaviour is different from typical user behaviour. The behaviour of abnormal users that differentiates from the standard behaviour is defined as an intrusion. There are two phases in the development of AIDS: the training phase and the testing phase. In the training phase, the normal traffic profile is used to learn a model of normal behaviour. In the testing phase, a new data set is used to develop the system's capacity to generalise to previously unseen intrusions. AIDS can be sub-categorized based on the method used for training, for instance, statistical-based, knowledge-based and machine learning-based (Butun et al., 2014).AIDS has attracted a lot of scholars because of its feature to overcome the limitation of SIDS.

        <p>The main advantage of AIDS is the ability to identify zero-day attacks because recognizing the abnormal user activity does not rely on a signature database (Alazab et al., 2012). AIDS triggers a danger signal when the examined behavior deviates from normal behavior. Furthermore, AIDS has a number of benefits. First, they can discover internal malicious activities. If an intruder starts making transactions in a stolen account that are unidentified in the typical user activity, it creates an alarm. Second, it is challenging for a cybercriminal to recognize what is a normal user behavior without producing an alert as the system is constructed from customized profiles.The main advantage of AIDS is the ability to identify zero-day attacks because recognizing the abnormal user activity does not rely on a signature database (Alazab et al., 2012).

        <p>Table 2 presents the differences between signaturebased detection and anomaly-based detection. The main difference between these two is that AIDS can discover zero-day attacks, whereas SIDS can only detect previously known intrusions. However, AIDS can result in a high false-positive rate because anomalies may just be new normal activities rather than genuine intrusions.Table 2 presents the differences between signaturebased detection and anomaly-based detection.

        <p>Some prior research has examined the use of different techniques to build AIDSs.

        <p>Supervised learning-based IDS techniques detect intrusions by using labeled training data. A supervised learning approach usually consists of two stages, namely, training and testing. In the training stage, relevant features and classes are identified and then the algorithm learns from these data samples. In supervised learning IDS, each record is a pair, containing a network or host data source and an associated output value (i.e., label), namely intrusion or normal. Next, feature selection can be applied to eliminating unnecessary features. Using the training data for selected features, a supervised learning technique is then used to train a classifier to learn the inherent relationship that exists between the input data and the labelled output value. A wide variety of supervised learning techniques have been explored in the literature, each with its advantages and disadvantages. In the testing stage, the trained model is used to classify the unknown data into intrusion or normal class. The resultant classifier then becomes a model that, given a set of feature values, predicts the class to which the input data might belong. Figure 5 shows a general approach for applying classification techniques. The most existing IDSs proposed are trained in a supervised way. It implies that the cybersecurity professional need to label the network traffic and revise the model manually from time to time.Supervised learning-based IDS techniques detect intrusions by using labeled training data.

        <p>There are many classification methods such as decision trees, rule-based systems, neural networks, support vector machines, naïve Bayes and k-nearest neighbour. Each technique uses a learning method to build a classification model. However, a suitable classification approach should not only handle the training data, but it should also identify accurately the class of records it has not ever seen before. Creating classification models with reliable generalization ability is an important task of the learning algorithm.There are many classification methods such as decision trees, rule-based systems, neural networks, support vector machines, naïve Bayes and k-nearest neighbour.

        <p>Decision trees A decision tree has three basic components. The first component is a decision node, which is used to identify a test attribute. The second is a branch, where each branch represents a possible decision based on the value of the test attribute. The third is a leaf that comprises the class to which the instance belongs (Rutkowski et al., 2014). There are many different decision tree algorithms, including ID3 (Quinlan, 1986), C4.5 (Quinlan, 2014) and CART (Breiman, 1996).Decision trees A decision tree has three basic components.

        <p>Naïve Bayes This approach is based on applying Bayes' principle with robust independence assumptions among the attributes. Naïve Bayes answers questions such as "what is the probability that a particular kind of attack is occurring, given the observed system activities?" by applying conditional probability formulae. Naïve Bayes relies on the features that have different probabilities of occurring in attacks and normal behavior. The naïve Bayes classification model is one of the most prevalent models in IDS due to its ease of use and calculation efficiency, both of which are taken from its conditional independence assumption property (Yang &amp; Tian, 2012). However, the system does not operate well if this independence assumption is not valid, as was demonstrated on the KDD'99 intrusion detection dataset, which has complex attribute dependencies (Koc et al., 2012). The results also reveal that the Naïve Bayes model has reduced accuracy for large datasets. A further study showed that the more sophisticated Hidden Naïve Bayes (HNB) model can be applied to IDS tasks that involve high dimensionality, extremely interrelated attributes and high-speed networks (Koc et al., 2012).Naïve Bayes This approach is based on applying Bayes' principle with robust independence assumptions among the attributes.

        <p>Genetic algorithms (GA) Genetic algorithms are a heuristic approach to optimization, based on the principles of evolution. Each possible solution is represented as a series of bits (genes) or chromosomes, and the quality of the solutions improves over time by the application of selection and reproduction operators, biased to favour fitter solutions. In applying a genetic algorithm to the intrusion classification problem, there are typically two types of chromosome encoding: one is according to clustering to generate binary chromosome coding method; another is specifying the cluster center (clustering prototype matrix) by an integer coding chromosome. Murray et al. have used GA to evolve simple rules for network traffic (Murray et al., 2014). Every rule is represented by a genome and the primary population of genomes is a number of random rules. Each genome is comprised of different genes that correspond to characteristics such as IP source, IP destination, port source, port destination and 1 protocol type (Hoque &amp; Bikas, 2012).Genetic algorithms (GA) Genetic algorithms are a heuristic approach to optimization, based on the principles of evolution.

        <p>Artificial neural network (ANN) ANN is one of the most broadly applied machine-learning methods and has been shown to be successful in detecting different malware. The most frequent learning technique employed for supervised learning is the backpropagation (BP) algorithm. The BP algorithm assesses the gradient of the network's error with respect to its modifiable weights. However, for ANN-based IDS, detection precision, particularly for less frequent attacks, and detection accuracy still need to be improved. The training dataset for lessfrequent attacks is small compared to that of morefrequent attacks, and this makes it difficult for the ANN to learn the properties of these attacks correctly. As a result, detection accuracy is lower for less frequent attacks. In the information security area, huge damage can occur if low-frequency attacks are not detected. For instance, if the User to Root (U2R) attacks evade detection, a cybercriminal can gain the authorization privileges of the root user and thereby carry out malicious activities on the victim's computer systems. In addition, less common attacks are often outliers (Wang et al., 2010). ANNs often suffer from local minima and thus learning can become very time-consuming. The strength of ANN is that, with one or more hidden layers, it can produce highly nonlinear models that capture complex relationships between input attributes and classification labels. With the development of many variants such as recurrent and convolutional NNs, ANNs are powerful tools in many classification tasks including IDS.Artificial neural network (ANN) ANN is one of the most broadly applied machine-learning methods and has been shown to be successful in detecting different malware.

        <p>This technique is based on the degrees of uncertainty rather than the typical true or false Boolean logic on which the contemporary PCs are created. Therefore, it presents a straightforward way of arriving at a conclusion based upon unclear, ambiguous, noisy, inaccurate or missing input data. With a fuzzy domain, fuzzy logic permits an instance to belong, possibly partially, to multiple classes at the same time. Therefore, fuzzy logic is a good classifier for IDS problems as the security itself includes vagueness, and the borderline between the normal and abnormal states is not well identified. In addition, the intrusion detection problem contains various numeric features in the collected data and several derived statistical metrics. Building IDSs based on numeric data with hard thresholds produces high false alarms. An activity that deviates only slightly from a model could not be recognized, or a minor change in normal activity could produce false alarms. With fuzzy logic, it is possible to model this minor abnormality to keep the false rates low. Elhag et al. showed that with fuzzy logic, the false alarm rate in determining intrusive actions could be decreased. They outlined a group of fuzzy rules to describe the normal and abnormal activities in a computer system, and a fuzzy inference engine to define intrusions (Elhag et al., 2015).This technique is based on the degrees of uncertainty rather than the typical true or false Boolean logic on which the contemporary PCs are created.

        <p>Support vector machines (SVM) SVM is a discriminative classifier defined by a splitting hyperplane. SVMs use a kernel function to map the training data into a higher-dimensioned space so that intrusion is linearly classified. SVMs are well known for their generalization capability and are mainly valuable when the number of attributes is large and the number of data points is small. Different types of separating hyperplanes can be achieved by applying a kernel, such as linear, polynomial, Gaussian Radial Basis Function (RBF), or hyperbolic tangent. In IDS datasets, many features are redundant or less influential in separating data points into correct classes. Therefore, feature selection should be considered during SVM training. SVM can also be used for classification into multiple classes. In the work by Li et al., an SVM classifier with an RBF kernel was applied to classify the KDD 1999 dataset into predefined classes (Li et al., 2012). From a total of 41 attributes, a subset of features was carefully chosen by using a feature selection method.Support vector machines (SVM) SVM is a discriminative classifier defined by a splitting hyperplane.

        <p>Hidden Markov model (HMM) HMM is a statistical Markov model in which the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process with unseen data. Prior research has shown that HMM analysis can be applied to identify particular kinds of malware (Annachhatre et al., 2015). In this technique, a Hidden Markov Model is trained against known malware features (e.g., operation code sequence) and once the training stage is completed, the trained model is applied to score the incoming traffic. The score is then contrasted to a predefined threshold, and a score greater than the threshold indicates malware. Likewise, if the score is less than the threshold, the traffic is identified as normal.Hidden Markov model (HMM) HMM is a statistical Markov model in which the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process with unseen data.

        <p>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier: The k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) technique is a typical non-parametric classifier applied in machine learning (Lin et al., 2015). The idea of these techniques is to name an unlabelled data sample to the class of its k nearest neighbors (where k is an integer defining the number of neighbors to be considered). Figure 6 illustrates a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier where k = 5. The point X represents an instance of unlabelled data that needs to be classified. Amongst the five nearest neighbors of X, there are three similar patterns from the class Intrusion and two from the class Normal. Taking a majority vote enables the assignment of X to the Intrusion class.K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier: The k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) technique is a typical non-parametric classifier applied in machine learning (Lin et al., 2015).

        <p>Ensemble methods Multiple machine learning algorithms can be used to obtain better predictive performance than any of the constituent learning algorithms alone (Vasan et al., 2020a). Training several classifiers at the same stage to detect different attacks, and then uniting their result to increase the detection rate. Typically, the ensemble's ability is better than a single classifier's, as it can enhance weak classifiers to produce better results than can a solitary classifier (Aburomman &amp; Reaz, 2017). Several different ensemble methods have been proposed, such as Boosting, Bagging and Stacking. Researchers have revealed that the combination of different classifier techniques is an effective way to resolve the shortcomings traditional IDSs have when they are applied for IoT. Jabbar et al. proposed an ensemble classifier that is built using Random Forest and also the Average One-Dependence Estimator (AODE which solves the attribute dependency problem in the Naïve Bayes classifier. Random Forest (RF) enhances precision and reduces false alarms (Jabbar et al., 2017). It is combining both approaches in ensemble results in improved accuracy over either technique applied independently.Ensemble methods Multiple machine learning algorithms can be used to obtain better predictive performance than any of the constituent learning algorithms alone (Vasan et al., 2020a).

        <p>Unsupervised learning is a kind of machine learning that makes use of input datasets without class labels to extract interesting information. The input data points are normally treated as a set of random variables. A joint density model is then created for the data set. In supervised learning, the output labels are given and used to train the machine to get the required results for an unseen data point. In contrast, in unsupervised learning, no labels are given, and instead, the data is grouped automatically into various classes through the learning process. In the context of developing an IDS, unsupervised learning means, use of a mechanism to identify intrusions by using unlabelled data to train the model. IoT network traffic is clustered into groups, based on the similarity of the traffic, without the need to predefine these groups.Unsupervised learning is a kind of machine learning that makes use of input datasets without class labels to extract interesting information.

        <p>As shown in Fig. 7, once records are clustered, all of the cases that appear in small clusters are labeled as an intrusion because the normal occurrences should produce sizable clusters compared to the anomalies. In addition, malicious intrusions and normal instances are dissimilar, thus they do not fall into an identical cluster.As shown in Fig. 7, once records are clustered, all of the cases that appear in small clusters are labeled as an intrusion because the normal occurrences should produce sizable clusters compared to the anomalies.

        <p>The K-means technique is one of the most prevalent techniques of clustering analysis that aims to separate 'n' data objects into 'k' clusters in which each data object is selected in the cluster with the nearest mean. K means it is an iterative clustering algorithm that aids to obtain the highest value for every iteration. It is a distance-based clustering technique and it does not need to compute the distances between all combinations of records. It applies a Euclidean metric as a similarity measure. The number of clusters is determined by the user in advance. Typically, several solutions will be tested before accepting the most appropriate one. Annachhatre et al. used the K-means clustering algorithm to identify different host behaviour profiles (Annachhatre et al., 2015). They have proposed new distance metrics that can be used in the k-means algorithm to relate the clusters closely. They have clustered data into several clusters and associated them with known behaviour for evaluation. Their outcomes have revealed that k-means clustering is a better approach to classify the data using unsupervised methods for intrusion detection when several kinds of datasets are available.

        <p>Deep reinforcement learning is the application of reinforcement learning to train deep neural networks. It has an input layer, an output layer, and multiple hidden layers same as prior deep neural networks. However, our input is the state of the environment. For instance, a bus is trying to get its passengers to their destination. The inputs are the position, speed, and direction; our output is a series of possible actions like speed up, slow down, turn left, or turn right. In addition, we're feeding our rewards signal into the network so that we can learn to associate what actions produce positive results given a specific state of the environment.Deep reinforcement learning is the application of reinforcement learning to train deep neural networks.

        <p>The recurrent neural network can function efficiently on a series of data with variable input length. This means that RNNs use the information of its prior state as an input for their current prediction, and we can repeat this process for an arbitrary number of steps allowing the network to propagate information via its hidden state through time. This is essentially like giving a neural network a short-term memory. This feature makes RNNs very effective for working with sequences of data that occur over time. Yin, et al.

A convolutional neural network contains an input and an output layer, as well as multiple hidden layers. The hidden layers of a CNN typically contain a sequence of convolutional layers that convolve with a multiplication. A CNN receives a 2-D input and abstracts high-level features via a sequence of hidden layers. CNN's, which better upon the architecture of the common neural networks, benefit from spatial features (Vasan et al., 2020c). Spatial features are usually applied types of traffic features in the area of IDS. When applying spatial features, network traffic is reformed into traffic images; it follows that the image classification technique is used to categorize the traffic images, which also ultimately achieves the objective of detecting the intrusion traffic. This technique is comparatively recent, but then numerous recent research results prove its great potential. For example, Vasan, et al. (Vasan et al., 2020b) adopted CNNS techniques and transformed the raw malware binary into both grayscale and colour images and apply the fine-tuned CNN architecture.Neural Network is contained of one or more convolutional layers and then linked by one or more fully connected layers as in a standard multilayer neural network (Vasan et al., 2020b).

        <p>Several IDS deploy distributed architectures. This includes a subset of the network checking the other nodes. Distributed IDS offers the incident analyst many advantages over centralized IDS. The main benefit is the capability to identify attack forms across a whole IoT ecosystem. This might increase prompt IoT attack prevention and detection. The additional supported benefit is to allow early detection of an IoT Botnet creating its way through corporate IoT devices. This data could then be used to detect and clean systems that have been infected by the IoT Botnet and stop further spread of the Botnet into the IoT ecosystem consequently take down any IoT devices damaged that would otherwise have occurred. Furthermore, the advantage of distributed IDS rather than centralized IDS computing resources also implies reduced control over those resources.Several IDS deploy distributed architectures.

        <p>In the centralized IDS location, the IDS is placed in central devices, for instance, in the boundary switch or a nominated device. All the information that the IoT devices collect and then send to the network boundary switch passes through the boundary switch (Benkhelifa et al., 2018). Consequently, the IDS positioned in a boundary switch can check the packets switched between the IoT devices and the network. Despite this, checking the network packets that pass through the boundary switch is not adequate to identify anomalies that affect the IoT devices. The network traffic is monitored in centralized IDS. This traffic is extracted from the network through different network data sources such as packet capture, 
            <rs type="software">NetFlow</rs>, etc. The computers connected in a network can be monitored by Network-based IDS. Moreover, NIDS is also capable of monitoring the external malicious activities that could have been commenced from an external threat at an earlier stage, before these threats expand to other computer systems. However, NIDS comes with some limitations such as its restricted ability to inspect the whole data in a high bandwidth network because of the volume of data passing through modern high-speed communication networks (Bhuyan et al., 2014). NIDS deployed at several positions within a particular network topology, together with HIDS and firewalls, can provide a concrete, resilient, and multi-tier protection against both external and insider attacks. Table 6 shows a summary of comparisons between IDS deployment strategies.

        <p>Cho et al. proposed a methodology for checking packets that are passing through the border router for communication between physical and network devices. Their methodology is based on the botnet attacks by checking the packet length (Cho et al., 2009). However, no information is presented about the technique employed to create a normal behaviour profile. It is also not clear how the proposed IDS techniques would work on resource constraints nodes in the IoT. Rathore et al. proposed semi-supervised Fuzzy learning-based distributed attack detection framework for IoT (Rathore &amp; Park, 2018). The evaluation was done proposed a threat analysis of IoT using ANN to detect DDoS/DoS attacks. A multi-level perceptron, a type of supervised ANN, is trained using internet packet traces and then the model is assessed on its ability to thwart (DDoS/DoS) attacks (Hodo et al., 2016). Hoda et al. did not consider effectiveness after the deployment of the proposed IDS in the IoT ecosystem on low-capacity devices. According to their experimentation, the system achieved an accuracy of 99.4% for DDoS/DoS. However, no details of the dataset are provided. Diro et al. developed an IoT network attack detection system based on distributed deep learning. Their work showed that distributed attack detection could identify IoT attacks better than a centralized strategy with a 96% detection rate. Their approach was evaluated using the NLS-KDD dataset. Even though this dataset is another version of the KDD data set, it still suffers from various issues reviewed by McHugh (McHugh, 2000). We believe this dataset should not be used as a practical benchmark dataset in the IoT as this data was collected from the traditional network (Diro &amp; Chilamkurti, 2018). This leads us to develop IDSs that take into consideration the specific requirement of IoT protocol such as (Low-power Wireless Personal Area Networks) 6Low-PAN. Hence, the Intrusion detection system that is created for the IoT ecosystem should operate under rigorous settings of low processing ability, high-speed connection, and big capacity data processing. Moustafa et al. proposed an ensemble of IDSs to detect abnormal activities, in specific botnet attacks against Domain Name System (DNS), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) (Moustafa et al., 2019). Their ensemble methods are based on the 
            <rs type="software">AdaBoost</rs> learning method and they used three machine learning techniques: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Decision Tree (DT) and Naive Bayes (NB) to evaluate their methodology (Moustafa et al., 2019). The proposed IDS result in significant overhead which degrades its performance.

However, their approach has not been evaluated for other types of attacks in the IoT. Khraisat, et al.

        <p>Transmission of data takes place at the network layer where the security issues occur and may lead to the attacks taking place. These attacks may be Eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, DoS attacks, storage attacks, exploit attacks, spoofing attacks, etc. IoT attacks comprise different forms of information security attacks that could be targeted on the specific components, network, or data sets. The devices present in the IoT networks may be targeted and physical security attacks may be executed. The majority of the IoT attacks are networkbased or are conducted to cause damage to the specific information properties. These are usually deliberate attacks to cause damage to the availability of the IoT application or cause an impact on the confidentiality of the data. Some of the significant threats at the network layer include: Man-in-the-middle (MITM)attack-Wireless communications of sensors may be in danger to the man in middle attacks that threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the IoT communicant (Neshenko et al., 2019). Wireless attacks could be encryption cracking, rogue wireless devices, Eavesdropping, MAC Spoofing, Packet sniffing, etc. A MITM attack occurs where the attacker without the permission of the authentication user alter the communications between two parties who think that they are secretary communicating with each other. It is just like an eavesdropping attack in which the attacker can insert into the communication of two parties. There is various type of MITM attack which are email hijacking, WIFI eavesdropping, Session Hijacking, DNS spoofing and IP spoofing. For example, an attacker can put in network spyware (a sniffer) on a computer or a server to carry out a spying attack and capture the packet during transmission. Moreover, any device in the network between the transmitting device and the receiving device are vulnerable to attackers, as are the initial and terminal devices themselves.Transmission of data takes place at the network layer where the security issues occur and may lead to the attacks taking place.

        <p>A denial of service attack prohibits the regular availability of the services that were being provided in a system. Legitimate users of the system are deprived of the resources. If this attack is launched by numerous malicious nodes, then it is called Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). A DOS attack will cost time and money to the victim rather than losing information due to service holders switching the services from the original provider concerning the security concerns. DoS attacks can impact network resources, bandwidth, and CPU time (Sherasiya et al., 2016). As the IoT devices and equipment are connected with the internet for 24 h and always on power-on mode, there is a high chance of an attack on the IoT network. Malware payloads can be sent at any time in the home or office IoT network. For instance, 'Mirai' is a botnet that mounted a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, which left much of the network unapproachable (Khraisat et al., 2019b).A denial of service attack prohibits the regular availability of the services that were being provided in a system.

        <p>Routing Protocol for Low-Power and lossy devices transmitter broadcasts the DODAG Information Object (DIO) during Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) formation. The receiver transmits its updated parent list, sibling list, rang and sends DAO message with route information after receiving the DIO (Mayzaud et al., 2016). After receiving the DIO message, the malicious nodes do not update; rather it always advertises a fake rank. The other non-malicious node receives the DIO message from the malicious node and updates its rank based on the fake rank. After the formation of DODAG, if the node that is transmitting the packet has a malicious node as the preferred parent, transmits the packet to it but the malicious node instead of transmitting the packet to its parent simply drops the packet resulting in zero throughputs.Routing Protocol for Low-Power and lossy devices transmitter broadcasts the DODAG Information Object (DIO) during Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) formation.

        <p>The low-cost and low-power intensive resource nodes capable of wireless networking allow the viability of new applications such as smart electricity grids as well as mobile health solutions. These power-efficient network devices could be combined with the existing network infrastructure so that they could utilize services already available, including the node's ability to control and datagathering. A node calculates its rank in the DODAG based on the objective code point specified in a received DIO message. If the node receives multiple DIO messages from its neighbors, then the neighbor that providing the best rank is chosen to be the parent. This way, it forms upwards routes towards the root. The DAO message that contains all possible routable prefixes is sent up the tree to create routes (Khraisat et al., 2019a) downwards. Each node receiving the DAO message aggregates the prefixes and propagates them further upwards, thereby making downwards routes available to parents.The low-cost and low-power intensive resource nodes capable of wireless networking allow the viability of new applications such as smart electricity grids as well as mobile health solutions.

        <p>RPL uses three control message types to create and maintain its graph topology and route table. The control messages include the DODAG Information Object (DIO), DODAG Advertisement Object (DAO) and DODAG Information Solicitations (DIS). The creation, maintenance, and discovery of the DODAG topology are done by using DIO. Nodes exchange DODAG messages while the RPL network is being initiated through DIO. The nodes select preferred parents with the help of DIO. RPL uses DAO messages for transmitting the prefix of a node to its ancestor nodes for downward routing purposes. Any unattached node uses the DIS message in the network for soliciting potential parent nodes. When a node cannot obtain DIO, DIS is triggered by a node after a certain time interval. RPL instance is the creation of an RPL network in a DODAG. These RPL instances can have their object functions and can consist of a DODAG.

Sybil attacks, where a sensor node claims multiple fake identities, could be highly damaging in the context of an e-health system. Through these attacks, an intruder could use pretend identities to send false information. Consequently, either a real emergency condition is missed.

        <p>The main issue in the KDD data set is a large number of duplicate packets. Tavallaee et al. analysed KDD training and test sets and revealed that approximately 78% and 75% of the network packets are duplicated in both the training and testing dataset (Tavallaee et al., 2009). This huge quantity of duplicate instances in the training set would influence machine-learning methods to be biased towards normal instances and thus prevent them from learning irregular instances that are typically more damaging to the computer system. Tavallaee et al. built the NSL-KDD dataset in 2009 from the KDD Cup'99 dataset to resolve the matters stated above by eliminating duplicated records (Tavallaee et al., 2009).

        <p>The most popular public datasets used for IDS research have been explored and their data collection techniques, evaluation results, and limitations have been discussed. There is a requirement for newer and more comprehensive datasets that consist of a broad spectrum of malware activities because the normal activities are changing frequently and might not remain effective over time. A new malware dataset is required, as most of the existing machine learning techniques are trained and evaluated on the knowledge provided by the old dataset such as DARPA/ KDD99, which do not include newer malware activities. Therefore, testing is done using these datasets collected in 1999 only, because they are publicly available and no other alternative and acceptable datasets are available. While widely accepted as benchmarks, these datasets no longer represent contemporary zero-day attacks and the IoT ecosystem (Venkatraman &amp; Alazab, 2018). Though the ADFA dataset contains many new attacks, it is not adequate. For that reason, testing of AIDS using these datasets does not offer a real evaluation and could result in inaccurate claims for their effectiveness.The most popular public datasets used for IDS research have been explored and their data collection techniques, evaluation results, and limitations have been discussed.

        <p>The main challenge for SIDS and AIDS is to detect attacks masked by evasion techniques. The ability of evasion techniques would be determined by the ability of IDS to bring back the original signature of the attacks or create new signatures to cover the modification of the attacks.

For example, SIDS in regular expressions can detect the deviations from simple mutations such as manipulating space characters, but they are still useless against several obfuscation techniques usually used by hackers to conceal malware such as encryption and packing.The main challenge for SIDS and AIDS is to detect attacks masked by evasion techniques.

Third, be able to detect zero-day attacks as new vulnerabilities are exposed. Fourth, be autonomous IDS and use contemporary techniques of machine learning and deep learning that can learn from the big IoT data. In addition, Future IoT IDS should have features including selfconfiguration, self-optimization, self-protection, and self-healing.To develop reliable IoT IDS based on heterogeneous device categories, a novel IDS must be developed.
