        <p>We are on the cusp of a new era of connected autonomous vehicles with unprecedented user experiences, tremendously improved road safety and air quality, highly diverse transportation environments and use cases, as well as a plethora of advanced applications. Realizing this grand vision requires a significantly enhanced vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication network which should be extremely intelligent and capable of concurrently supporting hyper-fast, ultra-reliable, and low-latency massive information exchange. It is anticipated that the sixth-generation (6G) communication systems will fulfill these requirements of the next-generation V2X. In this article, we outline a series of key enabling technologies from a range of domains, such as new materials, algorithms, and system architectures. Aiming for truly intelligent transportation systems, we envision that machine learning will play an instrumental role for advanced vehicular communication and networking. To this end, we provide an overview on the recent advances of machine learning in 6G vehicular networks.

        <p>I n recent years, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication has attracted significant research interest by both academia and industry. As a key enabler for intelligent transportation systems (ITS), V2X encompasses a broad range of wireless technologies including vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, and vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) communications), as well as communications with vulnerable road users (VRUs), and with cloud networks (V2N) [1]. The grand vision is that V2X communications, supported by the sixth generation (6G) of wireless systems [2], will be an instrumental element of future connected autonomous vehicles. Furthermore, V2X communications will bring far-reaching and transformative benefits such as unprecedented user experience, tremendously improved road safety and air quality, diverse transportation applications and use cases, as well as a plethora of advanced applications.I n recent years, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication has attracted significant research interest by both academia and industry.

        <p>So far, there have been two main technologies for V2X communications: 1) DSRC (Dedicated Short Range Communication)-based vehicular network and 2) the cellular-based vehicular network [3]. Standards laying the foundation of DSRC include IEEE 802.11p for Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) and IEEE 1609.1.4 for resource management, security, network service, and multichannel operation [4]. For many years, DSRC was the only technology for V2X communication. In dense and high-mobility environments, however, DSRC suffers from major drawbacks such as limited coverage, low data rate, limited quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees, and unbounded channel access delay. Leveraging standard cellular technologies, 3GPP has been developing a cellular vehicular communications standard, known as C-V2X. C-V2X enables every vehicle to communicate with different entities of a V2X network (such as V2V, V2I, V2P, and V2N) [5]. In March 2017, 3GPP Release 14 proposed LTE V2X communication with two air interfaces: a wide area network LTE interface (LTE-Uu) and a direct communications interface (PC5, also known as LTE side-link). The LTE-Uu is responsible for vehicle to network (V2N) communication, while the LTE side-link is responsible for V2V and V2I communications, which may operate without support from cellular network infrastructure [6]. The main focus of Release 14 is to deliver data transport services for fundamental road safety services such as cooperative awareness messages (CAM), basic safety messages (BSM), or decentralized environmental notification messages (DENM).So far, there have been two main technologies for V2X communications: 1) DSRC (Dedicated Short Range Communication)-based vehicular network and 2) the cellular-based vehicular network [3].

        <p>In Release 15 (announced in 2018), 5G New Radio (5G NR) V2X technology was introduced to support advanced V2X services such as vehicle platooning, advanced driver assistance, remote driving, and extended sensors [7], [8]. In addition, the performance of the PC5 interface has been enhanced in Release 15 (known as LTE-eV2X) in terms of higher reliability (employing transmit diversity), lower latency (with the aid of resource selection window reduction), and higher data rates (using carrier aggregation and higher order modulation e.g., 64-QAM), while retaining backward compatibility with Release 14 LTE-V2X. In 2020, 3GPP announced the second phase of 5G NR in Release 16, which aims at bringing enhanced ultra reliable low latency communication (URLLC) and higher throughput. Note that 3GPP is currently working on Release 17, which aims to provide architectural enhancements to support advanced V2X services. The evolution of V2X communications is summarized in Fig. 1.In Release 15 (announced in 2018), 5G New Radio (5G NR) V2X technology was introduced to support advanced V2X services such as vehicle platooning, advanced driver assistance, remote driving, and extended sensors [7], [8].

        <p>From an industry standpoint, there has been a major debate on which V2X technology should be adopted. Government regulations and public acceptance are two additional major factors which affect the real roll out of V2X technologies. Take the United States (US) as an example, during the Obama administration, a mandate was proposed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to support DSRC in all new vehicles, but no progress has been made during the Trump administration. Although Europe and Japan are in favour of DSRC, C-V2X has received tremendous support from the US and China, mainly driven by large telecommunication companies such as Qualcomm and Huawei, respectively. As a result, automakers may need to investigate and accommodate different V2X technologies according to their market-shares in different jurisdictions as well as the inter-working of both DSRC and C-V2X [9]. For instance, although Toyota was the first global automaker to sell connected vehicles equipped with DSRC technology, it is also testing C-V2X in China, and both DSRC and C-V2X in Australia [10]. In 2019, Volkswagen, a German motor vehicle manufacturer, made a move to fully embrace DSRC [11], while Ford in the US plans to enable all of its new vehicles to be able to "Talk and Listen" by 2022 through 5G NR based C-V2X [12]. Road safety and traffic efficiency are two important aspects for public acceptance. Albeit autonomous vehicles have been actively studied and tested by companies like Tesla, Uber, Waymo, and Toyota, the safety of driver-less cars remains of utmost concern for the public, especially after the pedestrian death caused by a self-driving Uber car in 2018 and the Tesla car crash in 2021. Therefore, it is pressing for V2X to evolve to facilitate advanced orchestrations of communication, sensing, learning and decision making.From an industry standpoint, there has been a major debate on which V2X technology should be adopted.

        <p>Although 5G-NR V2X offers improved performance with advanced services, its improved performance is achieved through investing more in spectral and hardware resources while inheriting the underlying mechanisms and system architectures of LTE-based V2X [14]. Meanwhile, it is anticipated that the number of autonomous vehicles will grow rapidly in the future due to urbanization, increased living standards, and technological advancements. This will drive an explosive growth of communications devices and digital applications to enable intelligent autonomous vehicles. In addition, the rising demand for many emerging services in autonomous vehicles ranging from 3D displays that offer more depth and more natural viewing experience and free-floating, to holographic control display systems, to immersive entertainment, to improved in-car infotainment, will bring forth new communication challenges to the V2X network [14]- [18]. All these advances will drastically push the capacity limits of existing wireless networks, posing new scientific and technical challenges for vehicular networks in terms of data rate, latency, coverage, spectral/energy/cost efficiency, intelligence level, networking, and security, among others.Although 5G-NR V2X offers improved performance with advanced services, its improved performance is achieved through investing more in spectral and hardware resources while inheriting the underlying mechanisms and system architectures of LTE-based V2X [14].

        <p>With this vision in mind, 5G NR-based V2X networks may be unable to meet such a wide range of requirements and use cases. Moreover, while the concepts associated with ITS have been studied for many years, legacy V2X communication systems can only provide limited intelligence. Therefore, a significant paradigm shift away from traditional communication networks to more versatile and diversified network approaches is needed. It is anticipated that such a transformation will start from the recently proposed 6G wireless communication network, which aims to combine terrestrial and several non-terrestrial communication networks such as satellite and unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) communication networks. This will enable genuinely intelligent and ubiquitous V2X systems with significantly enhanced reliability and security, extremely high data rates (e.g., Tbps), massive and hyper-fast wireless access (i.e., down to sub-milliseconds with billions of communications devices connected), as well as much smarter, longer, and greener (energy-efficient) three-dimensional (3D) communication coverage [2]. Because of the extremely heterogeneous network composition, diverse communication scenarios, and stringent service requirements, new techniques are needed to enable adaptive learning and intelligent decision making in future V2X networks. It is foreseen that 6G will work in conjunction with machine learning (ML) not only to unfold the full capability of the radio signals by evolving to intelligent and autonomous radios, but also to bring a series of new features such as enhanced context-awareness, self-aggregation, adaptive coordination, and self-configuration [14].With this vision in mind, 5G NR-based V2X networks may be unable to meet such a wide range of requirements and use cases.

        <p>To achieve the aforementioned ambitious goals, 6G will require the integration of a range of disruptive technologies including more robust and efficient air interfaces, resource allocation, decision making, and computing. Fig. 2 illustrates such a 6G-V2X system where a range of vehicular communication technologies are adopted to serve various advanced use cases.

        <p>There are a range of key technologies that we believe will enable the future vision of 6G-V2X as an intelligent, autonomous, user driven connectivity and service platform for ITS. We will introduce these technologies in the following with more detail in the subsequent sections. We classify these technologies into two categories: revolutionary V2X technologies and evolutionary V2X technologies. Strength, open challenges, maturity, and enhancing areas of these technologies are summarized in Table I. First, we consider technology areas such as intelligent reflective surfaces (IRSs), a range of new ML techniques, and brain-vehicle interfacing as key enablers (from the perspectives of new materials, algorithms, and neuroscience, respectively) for more intelligent V2X, which will further enhance and revolutionize evolving V2X technologies. Tactile communication will provide drivers and passengers with an unprecedented travel experience in the future by exchanging sensory information such as haptics anytime and anywhere. Emerging quantum computing technology will endow 6G-V2X systems with superior computational capabilities, while we will also see significantly enhanced security along with the use of blockchain technologies. Furthermore, terahertz (THz) communications will enable ultra high data rates never experienced before.There are a range of key technologies that we believe will enable the future vision of 6G-V2X as an intelligent, autonomous, user driven connectivity and service platform for ITS.

        <p>Here, the various technologies listed in Table I may interact with each other to deliver unprecedented driving experience, especially for fully autonomous vehicles. First, many gigabit per second data rates can be enabled via millimeter wave communication, VLC, and THz communications, whereas ultra-low latency and reliable information exchange can be supported by multiple radio access technologies, new multi-carrier scheme, and advanced resource allocation. For massive and ubiquitous vehicular access, NOMA and satellite/UAV aided V2X are two promising wireless paradigms. Additionally, integrated sensing, localization and communication will contribute to cm-level positioning and cm/s-level velocity estimation accuracy; artificial intelligence and brain-vehicle interfacing will lead to augmented awareness of both the complex physical and electromagnetic environments.Here, the various technologies listed in Table I may interact with each other to deliver unprecedented driving experience, especially for fully autonomous vehicles.

        <p>For example, NOMA has been employed in [19] to support low-latency tactile internet for autonomous vehicles, thanks to its enabling of massive connectivity and thus faster random access. In NOMA-based V2X, data security is a real issue as one user's decoding often involves the decoding of other users. Such an issue may be addressed by utilizing blockchain for secured networking, as reported in [20]. On the other hand, the low latency nature of NOMA may help tackle the slow access problem in blockchain based V2X networking, imposed by the inherent algorithm in attaining consensus among decentralized entities such as vehicles and infrastructure. Also, to realize both the orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and sparse-code multiple access (SCMA) [21] (one of the typical code-domain NOMA schemes [22]) according to the requirements of specific V2X use cases, a highly flexible and scalable multi-carrier system is preferred. The selection of new multicarrier waveform for OMA or SCMA and with respect to different QoS requirements (e.g., mobility, spectral efficiency, error rate performance) is of strong interest for reliable, ubiquitous, fast, and efficient wireless access in 6G V2X. Enhanced integrated sensing, localization and communication for autonomous vehicles may also be carried out with the aid of IRS and THz mapping [23]- [25]. Additionally, enhanced vehicular message dissemination is also expected to transform the future of electric vehicles (EVs), which are the automotive industry's response to address fossil fuel depletion and environmental pollution [26]. It is anticipated that 6G V2X will significantly improve both the driving efficiency and battery efficiency of EVs. As the road conditions and the best routes are predictable, optimized driving modes for EVs can be applied for battery and travel time-saving [27], [28]. With 6G V2X, the EV battery status can be better monitored and configured through cloud-based computation or machine learning [29], [30]. EV charging times can also be optimized as 6G V2X can guide an EV to find the most convenient charging stations at different periods of a day/season. In this case, a nearest charging station may not be the best as there might be many EVs queuing for charging and also the driving time to that charging station may be long during peak-hour periods.For example, NOMA has been employed in [19] to support low-latency tactile internet for autonomous vehicles, thanks to its enabling of massive connectivity and thus faster random access.

        <p>In conventional communication theory, wireless channels are regarded as a destructive and adversarial entity, yielding distorted received signals, causing excessive training overhead, yet having limited channel capacity. One of the most destructive wireless channels is called doubly selective channel (i.e., time-and-frequency selective) which widely appears in vehicular communication systems due to the mobility of transmitter and/or receiver. Furthermore, V2X communication signals may experience significant shadowing effects due to high-rise buildings in urban areas or hills and major vegetation in rural environments. To achieve robust information flow in high mobility channels, LTE and 5G NR-based V2X systems are configured with large subcarrier spacing 1 as well as dense pilot placement. However, this may result in a considerably reduced spectral efficiency, not to mention very complex signal processing algorithms at the receiver.In conventional communication theory, wireless channels are regarded as a destructive and adversarial entity, yielding distorted received signals, causing excessive training overhead, yet having limited channel capacity.

        <p>More recently a disruptive communication technique called intelligent reflective surfaces (IRSs) [31], [32] has attracted increased attention, aiming at creating a smart radio environment by customizing the propagation of radio wavefronts. Specifically, IRSs are man-made programmable metasurfaces (consisting of a vast amount of tiny and passive antenna-elements with reconfigurable processing networks), which can effectively control the phase, amplitude, frequency, and even polarization of the incident wireless signals to overcome the negative effects of natural wireless propagation. As such, IRSs allow the environment itself to be considered as an element of the communication system, whose operation can be optimized to enable higher rates, enlarged coverage and 1 A relatively large subcarrier spacing is needed in high mobility channels due to the frequency dispersion incurred by the Doppler spread; or the V2X communication system could suffer from substantial increase of inter-carrier interference which in turn leads to drastic deterioration of the error rate performance.

        <p>6G-V2X can take advantage of IRS in coverage-limited scenarios (e.g., V2X communications operating at millimeter-wave (mmWave) or THz bands) or unfavorable propagation conditions (e.g., non-line-of-sight communication links). In such scenarios, the use of an IRS can enhance the vehicular channel conditions by introducing enhanced multi-path propagation which will result in larger transmission coverage. An out-of-coverage traffic intersection is an ideal use case scenario for using an IRS, because the V2V communication links may be blocked by buildings and other obstructions. Measurements have shown that the strength of the received V2V signal power reduces quickly over distance away from the intersection due to such blockages [34], [35]. As such, vehicles located in perpendicular streets may not communicate with each other very well, which could result in significant degradation of V2V communication performance. To mitigate this issue, IRS may be installed on the surfaces of buildings around the intersection. The communication coverage of transmitting vehicles in the perpendicular streets can thus be enhanced by fine tuning the reflecting elements of IRS. An IRS-assisted vehicular communication scenario is illustrated in Fig. 4. It is interesting to point out that IRS can be employed for mitigation/suppression of the Doppler effect and multi-path fading, making IRS an appealing research direction for significantly enhanced V2X communication in 6G. Specifically, recent work [36] has shown that 1) the rapid fluctuations in the received signal strength due to the Doppler effect can be effectively reduced by using real-time tunable IRS and 2) for more general propagation environments with several interacting objects, even a few real-time tunable IRS can remarkably reduce the Doppler spread and the deep fades in the received signal. For a high mobility wireless channel, a Doppler mitigation method by novel transmission protocol and real-time phase control of IRS has been developed in [37]. To efficiently integrate with 6G-V2X, IRS needs to overcome some fundamental challenges such as reflection optimization, optimal placement of IRS, channel estimation in a highly dynamic vehicular environment and adaptation to different spectrum ranges.6G-V2X can take advantage of IRS in coverage-limited scenarios (e.g., V2X communications operating at millimeter-wave (mmWave) or THz bands) or unfavorable propagation conditions (e.g., non-line-of-sight communication links).

        <p>Tactile communication is a revolutionary technology, which enables a paradigm shift from the current digital content-oriented communications to a steer/control-oriented communications by allowing real-time transmission of haptic or sensual information (i.e., touch, motion, vibration, surface texture) [38]. By integrating human sensual information, tactile communication in 6G-V2X is expected to provide a truly immersive experience for on-board vehicle users [39]. In addition to traditional applications of multimedia communications (e.g., on-board meetings/demonstrations, infotainment), tactile communication will enhance vehicular specific applications such as remote driving, vehicle platooning, and driver training by enabling fast and reliable transfer of sensor data along with the haptic information related to driving experience and trajectories. Several haptic-based warning signals (e.g., waking up drowsy drivers or catching distracted drivers' attention) have been developed and tested for automotive applications to improve driving safety [40]- [42]. On the other hand, tactile-based V2X can be extremely helpful to vulnerable road users by providing them with appropriate haptic signals that will enhance their safety and activity. For instance, authors in [43] used haptic signals to combine cycling with cooperative driving while supporting cyclists moving in a platoon. The authors observed that the proposed system enhanced cycling behavior without negatively impacting concentration levels.Tactile communication is a revolutionary technology, which enables a paradigm shift from the current digital content-oriented communications to a steer/control-oriented communications by allowing real-time transmission of haptic or sensual information (i.e., touch, motion, vibration, surface texture) [38].

        <p>Despite tactile communication's immense potential, there are still many challenges. For example, tactile communication requires extremely high-speed and extremely low-latency communication to ensure reliable and real-time exchange of large volumes of haptic information [19]. These stringent connectivity constraints are very difficult to meet in high mobility vehicular environments. This is because they require higher frequencies (e.g., mmWave or even THz) to meet their data demand. However, those higher frequencies are not very reliable particularly in mobile environments. For example, in [44], we showed that even in an indoor environment THz networks may not be able to provide highly reliable high-rate communications. This, in turn, motivates research to develop a new breed of services called highly reliable high rate low latency communications (HRLLC) that can provide a combination of traditional 5G services (e.g., enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services that ignore reliability and URLLC services that ignore rate). Apart from the above challenges, tactile communication poses several fundamental challenges including design of application-specific control and communication protocols, development of human-to-machine interfaces for wireless haptic interactions, and design of suitable haptic codecs to capture and represent the haptic data, and exact reconstruction of received haptic data.Despite tactile communication's immense potential, there are still many challenges.

        <p>In a brain-controlled vehicle (BCV), the vehicle is controlled by the human mind rather than any physical interaction of the human with the vehicle. For people with disabilities, BCV may offer great potential for improved independence by providing an alternative interface for them to control vehicles [45]. On the other hand, brain-vehicle interfacing may lead to an improvement in manual driving by predicting a driver's actions and detecting discomfort [46]. Although the current vision is for fully automated vehicles, the adaptability of humans will play an irreplaceable role in managing the uncertainties and complexity of autonomous driving [47]. By keeping humans in the loop, a BCV is expected to mitigate the limitations of autonomous driving in challenging and uncertain environments such as rural and unstructured areas. Current wireless communication (e.g., 5G) and computation technologies are not able to realize BCV as services related to brain-machine interactions will require simultaneously ultra-high reliability, ultra-low latency, and ultra-high data rate communication and ultra-high-speed computation. For example, a coarse estimation of the whole brain recording demand is about 100 Gbps [48], the transmission of which is not supported by existing wireless technologies. However, through full-phased brain-vehicle interfacing and machine learning techniques, 6G-V2X must support the learning and adapting to the behaviour of human drivers.In a brain-controlled vehicle (BCV), the vehicle is controlled by the human mind rather than any physical interaction of the human with the vehicle.

THz communications can be a potential solution to enable high-throughput and low-latency brain-vehicle interfacing. Fundamentally different performance metrics (e.g., quality of physical experience (QoPE)) need to be introduced and quantified to capture the physiological characteristics and then map into the conventional wireless QoS metrics [48].

        <p>The widespread deployment of V2X networks very much relies on significantly enhanced security for large scale vehicular message dissemination and authentication. The consideration for this imposes new constraints for resource allocation in V2X networks. For example, mission critical messages should have ultra-resilient security to deal with potential malicious attacks or jamming, whilst multimedia data services may require only lightweight security due to the large amount of data. These two types of security requirements lead to different frame structures, routing/relaying strategies, and power/spectrum allocation approaches. 6G-V2X can adopt a blockchain system that is viewed as a disruptive technology for secured de-centralized transactions involving multiple parties. Compared to traditional security and privacy techniques, the use of blockchain can provide a wide range of enhanced security and privacy services without requiring any third parties [51]. Through the inherent distributed ledger technology of blockchain, 6G-V2X communication can perform distributed security management, offloading certain tasks with mobile cloud/edge/fog computing, and content caching. A blockchain-based security solution (e.g., smart contract or consensus mechanism) in 6G-V2X is expected to not only allow verification of the authenticity of a message, but also preserve the privacy of the sender [52], [53]. Moreover, the characteristics of blockchains are of interest for management of unlicensed spectrum, which allows different users to share the same spectrum. 6G-V2X may also utilize a blockchain-based spectrum sharing approach, which has the potential to provide secure, smarter, low-cost, and highly efficient decentralized spectrum sharing [54].The widespread deployment of V2X networks very much relies on significantly enhanced security for large scale vehicular message dissemination and authentication.

        <p>THz communication, which operates at terahertz bands (0.1-10 THz), is envisioned as a promising approach to alleviate increasingly congested spectrum [16], [55] at lower frequencies. Leveraging the availability of ultra-wide bandwidth, THz communication will be able to provide transmission rates ranging from hundreds of Gbps to several Tbps. Such an extremely high throughput will enable a plethora of new V2X application scenarios such as ultra-fast massive data transfer between vehicles and haptic communications. Since THz communication is able to provide fiber-like data rates without the need for wires between multiple devices at a distance of a few meters, it may also be used in on-board use cases such as the BCV scenario, where extremely high throughput and low latency wireless communication is required.THz communication, which operates at terahertz bands (0.1-10 THz), is envisioned as a promising approach to alleviate increasingly congested spectrum [16], [55] at lower frequencies.

In particular, it is essential to characterize and understand THz radio propagation in different V2X scenarios such as highway, urban, and in-vehicle. One of the main challenges in THz-assisted 6G-V2X will be the effective use of traditional cellular and new THz bands. As such, suitable dynamic resource scheduling is required to exploit their unique benefits.

Moreover, quantum domain security is based on the quantum key distribution (QKD) framework that allows to detect any malicious eavesdropping attempt. For example, the use of quantum federated learning to securely execute learning tasks among vehicles can be an important use case [59].If available, we can envision that quantum computing will offer enhanced security in V2X communications.

        <p>In 6G-V2X, it is expected that the vehicle and its occupants will be served at extraordinarily high data rates and with extremely low latency. However, this feature may not be feasible with standalone radio-frequency (RF)-based V2X communication as conventional RF-based vehicular communication often suffers from high interference, large latency, and low packet delivery rates in highly dense scenarios [61], [62]. One alternative approach may be the combination of RF and visible light communication (VLC)-based V2X communications, where along with radio waves, visible light can be used as a medium of communication in vehicular networks. A hybrid RF-VLC-based V2X communication scenario is shown in Fig. 5. The ultra-high data rate (potentially up to 100 Gbps) achieved by light emitting diode (LED) or laser diode (LD)-based VLC [63] and its inherent features (such as low power consumption, enhanced security, and anti-electromagnetic interference), make VLC technology an ideal candidate for future ITS. Moreover, a VLC-based V2X communication system will require minimum setup cost as VLC-based V2X can be implemented by using the existing LEDs/LDs in vehicle headlights or pre-installed street/traffic lights.In 6G-V2X, it is expected that the vehicle and its occupants will be served at extraordinarily high data rates and with extremely low latency.

        <p>In V2X networks, VLC can be mainly used in the following three scenarios: V2V communication through headlights/backlights, V2X communication through traffic lights, and V2X communication through street lights. Note that the traffic/street lights can be used to establish backhaul links with one another by using free-space coherent optical communications [55]. In addition to enhancing the data rate, VLC can boost the performance of V2X networks by eliminating the limitations of traditional RF-based V2X communications. For example, in the presence of big vehicle shadowing, RF-based V2V communication suffers from severe packet drop due to high path-loss and packet collision [64]. In this scenario, the transmitting vehicle can communicate with the big vehicle through VLC and then the big vehicle can relay the messages to the vehicles in the shadow region. Similarly, using VLC, traffic/street lights can also be used in the urban intersections to relay the messages to facilitate communication between vehicles from perpendicular streets, where traditional RF-based V2V communication often suffers from severe packet loss. Note that while RF-based solutions (e.g., big vehicle or roadside unit (RSU) relaying) of the above problems are studied in the literature, such solutions can cause severe interference in the high-density scenarios due to the RF-based re-transmissions [34].In V2X networks, VLC can be mainly used in the following three scenarios: V2V communication through headlights/backlights, V2X communication through traffic lights, and V2X communication through street lights.

        <p>Although extensive research has been carried out on VLC-based V2X communication in the past decade, VLC has not been included in the 5G-V2X standard. Several open issues still need to be solved for enabling hybrid RF-VLC V2X. These include interoperability between VLC as well as RF technologies and deployment issues. In an outdoor environment, the performance of VLC degrades due to the interference caused by natural and artificial light sources. On the other hand, the received signal strength in VLC may dramatically vary due the vehicles' mobility [65], [66]. Hence, ambient lighting induced interference and mobility induced channel variations need to be properly addressed before deploying VLC in 6G-V2X systems.Although extensive research has been carried out on VLC-based V2X communication in the past decade, VLC has not been included in the 5G-V2X standard. Several open issues still need to be solved for enabling hybrid RF-VLC V2X. These include interoperability between VLC as well as RF technologies and deployment issues.

        <p>6G-V2X will require massive connectivity for timely, reliable, seamless and ubiquitous exchange of V2X messages. This is to allow connected vehicles to constantly sense and interact with the environments for full situational awareness and hence considerably improved safety. A key enabling technology for 6G-V2X networks to meet these requirements is NOMA. Compared to traditional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes, NOMA allows multiple users to utilize time and frequency resources concurrently for both random access and multiplexing [67], [68]. There are two main types of NOMA: power-domain NOMA [69], [70] and code-domain NOMA [22], [71], such as SCMA [21], [72]- [74] and resource spread multiple access [75], in which multiple users are separated by different power levels and different codebooks/sequences, respectively. In recent years, NOMA has been proposed for grant-free access to achieve ultra-low latency massive connectivity whilst achieving superior spectrum efficiency.6G-V2X will require massive connectivity for timely, reliable, seamless and ubiquitous exchange of V2X messages.

        <p>As a matter of fact, NOMA can be a strong complement to other aforementioned 6G-V2X enabling technologies for use in both V2V and V2I communications. For example, NOMA can be used for distributed V2V autonomous scheduling, where connected vehicles need to contend for the random access control channel to reserve resources for data packet transmissions. In large scale 6G-V2X networks, the control channel with traditional random access schemes may be saturated, leading to severe collisions on scheduling assignment packets and significant loss of data packet reliability. With the application of NOMA (e.g., SCMA) for control channels, collisions of scheduling packets can be significantly reduced and the reliability of data packets can thus be improved. NOMA can also be applied in large scale 6G-V2X networks to achieve efficient data packet transmission. This requires multiple communication modes, such as unicast and multicast, which have been added for V2X communications (in addition to broadcast) since Release 15. These multiple communication modes pave the way for the application of NOMA, where broadcast packets may be superimposed by unicast or multicast packets targeting very close neighboring vehicles [76]. In this scenario, power domain NOMA, in which a large portion of transmit power is allocated to broadcast packets and the remaining for unicast or multicast packets, may be used.As a matter of fact, NOMA can be a strong complement to other aforementioned 6G-V2X enabling technologies for use in both V2V and V2I communications.

        <p>Exploiting the higher frequency spectrum in the mmWave and THz range is vital to achieve the 6G KPIs (e.g., Tbps data rates, billions of connected devices, sub-milliseconds of access latency). The rich frequency resources at mmWave and THz bands can provide larger bandwidth (e.g., multi-Gigabits and 10s GHz for mmWave and THz, respectively) than the one available at sub-6 GHz, which is highly congested in existing cellular systems. These rich frequency resources are needed to enable high data rates and low latency for 6G-V2X communications. Extensive research has been carried out studying infrastructure-based 5G mmWave communications, such as channel modelling and massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) beamforming. However, V2X communications in mmWave and THz frequency bands suffer from excessive propagation loss and susceptibility to blockage by obstacles such as vehicles and buildings.

        <p>In order to address the above challenges of supporting multi-radio technologies and increased algorithm complexity, advanced resource allocation schemes are needed, which could be built with the support of context awareness and cross-layer design. A hybrid RRM framework can be created, in which both dedicated radio resources and a shared resource pool are allocated to the connected vehicles for V2V and V2I communications. The dedicated radio resources to the individual CAVs ensure a basic but critical level of QoS is guaranteed for various CAV applications. The shared resource pools are then provided to flexibly accommodate the temporary loss of mmWave or THz connections and adapt to fast changing network conditions. The allocation can be adjusted adaptively according to the QoS feedback and the context. Context awareness of the communication system and the driving environment could be pivotal for cross-layer design of RRM solutions. For instance, in [85], we showed how one could use such smart multi-radio solutions (at mmWave and sub-6 GHz) with context-awareness to provide a reliable video performance at high mobility. To deal with the very large action space and time complexity of RRM and QoS control problems, distributed intelligent solutions over multi-radios that are able to dynamically allocate resource blocks (RBs) and power should be designed following the hybrid RRM framework. Reinforcement learning could be applied to design such intelligent solutions.

Connected vehicles and high-speed trains, moving at speeds of 1000 km/h or even higher [16], [54], will communicate with each other and the surroundings including various sensors, infrastructure nodes (e.g., roadside units, base stations, robots), satellites, and the internet cloud. Such high speeds may lead to significantly reduced channel coherence time and as a result, the vehicular channel fading coefficients are rapidly time-varying. Considering the effects of large Doppler and multipath propagation, innovation is needed to cope with the increased interference seen by the receiver [86]. In both LTE and 5G NR, OFDM and its variants are adopted for high-rate transmissions [87], [88]. Nevertheless, OFDM is very sensitive to the Doppler effect which may destroy the multi-carrier orthogonality and result in increased amounts of inter-carrier interference and inter-symbol interference. To overcome this drawback, some advanced multicarrier waveforms [89] may be excellent candidates to 6G V2X. A promising multicarrier waveform is filter-bank multicarrier (FBMC) which enjoys tight spectrum containment as well as relatively strong resilience to carrier frequency offsets and Doppler spreads.

        <p>Recently, orthogonal time-frequency-space (OTFS) has emerged as an effective multi-carrier scheme by spreading each information symbol over a two dimensional (2D) orthogonal basis function spanning across the time-frequency domain [91]- [93]. In principle, OTFS is capable of converting a time-varying multipath channel into a relatively static delay-Doppler image of the constituent reflectors. The 2D basis function in OTFS, called discrete symplectic Fourier transform (DSFT), is essentially an orthogonal precoding transform to harvest the diversity gain from time, frequency, and space domains. Thus, it would be interesting to investigate new multicarrier transforms with reference to OTFS for enhanced performance in high mobility environments.

        <p>Attaining improved situational awareness for connected vehicles is dependent on not just rapid and reliable communication, but also high-resolution sensing and high-accuracy localization (or positioning/mapping). While sensing helps extract key information (such as ranges, speeds, moving directions, etc) of vehicles, pedestrians, obstacles, and infrastructure, localization permits every vehicle to acquire its precise position which is of utmost importance for safe manoeuvring of vehicles (especially autonomous vehicles). The improved situational awareness will in turn facilitate the exploration of endless opportunities of position-based services as well as advanced V2X applications such as real-time 3D mapping for building an accurate environment model. Like communication, both sensing and localization rely on electromagnetic radio waves to measure, track and interact with the driving surroundings. Hence, it is worthy to explore the natural synergy of sensing, localization and communication by observing the fact that they share similar signal processing operations (e.g., carrier modulation/demodulation, synchronization) as well as hardware implementation. Very recently, in the 6G research community, there has been a strong voice to integrate these three into one converged RF system for higher spectrum-and energy-efficiencies, lower hardware cost/storage, as well as mutually enhanced functionalities [24], [25].Attaining improved situational awareness for connected vehicles is dependent on not just rapid and reliable communication, but also high-resolution sensing and high-accuracy localization (or positioning/mapping).

        <p>Among others, there have already been tremendous research attempts concerning the integration of sensing and communication (ISAC) [103] and integrated localization and communication (ILAC) [17]. ISAC, also known as fusion of radar and communication (RadCom) [104] and dual-function radar and communication (DFRC), has emerged recently as a disruptive design paradigm for 6G mobile networks with an important application for connected vehicles. For example, in [105], the preambles of the single-carrier 802.11ad system have been exploited to carry out long-range radar sensing in the 60 GHz unlicensed band. It is shown in [105] that a gigabits-per-second data rate is achieved simultaneously with cm-level range accuracy and cm/s-level velocity accuracy for a single-target scenario. An architecture for an OFDM based RadCom system has been studied in [104] with unique advantages to the radar application, such as, very high dynamic range, independence from the transmitted user data, the enabling of relative velocity estimation, and efficient implementation based on fast Fourier transform.Among others, there have already been tremendous research attempts concerning the integration of sensing and communication (ISAC) [103] and integrated localization and communication (ILAC) [17].

        <p>Similar to the state-of-the-art of ISAC, centimeter-level localization accuracy is expected by leveraging ultra massive MIMO, mmWave technologies, and UAV/satellite networks. On the other hand, the vehicles' location information can assist wireless networks with a wide range of information such as location-aided channel state information, beam processing, routing, network design, operations, and optimization to effectively utilize network infrastructure and radio resources. Research has already started in this direction. In [106], location information has been used in cognitive radios and for network optimization applications, whereas in [107], [108] resource allocation utilizing location information has been proposed for a multi-user and multi-cell system. A comprehensive survey can be found in [109] on location-aware communication across various layers of the protocol stack. In [110]- [114], joint localization and data transmission have been studied for 5G networks using different beamforming schemes. A key challenge here is how to allocate the radio resources effectively between localization and communication while maintaining their QoS requirements. To tackle this problem, ML-based approaches can be used since ML can unfold the full capability of the radio resources intelligently [17]. In both ISAC and ILCA, optimal waveform design with ultra-high spectral efficiency is another challenge, which can be solved through effective spectrum sharing techniques or by properly sharing one waveform. The unified design of transceivers also needs to be considered for the seamless integration of localization and communication.Similar to the state-of-the-art of ISAC, centimeter-level localization accuracy is expected by leveraging ultra massive MIMO, mmWave technologies, and UAV/satellite networks.

        <p>The key benefits of vehicle platooning include increased road capacity, a rise in fuel efficiency and comfortable road trips. Each vehicle in the platoon must know its relative distance and velocity with its neighboring vehicles in vehicle platooning to coordinate their acceleration and deceleration. Most of the prior works in this direction are either communication-centric [118]- [120] or control centric [121]- [123]. The former entirely abstracts the control mechanism, while the latter assumes that the performance of the communication networks is deterministic. However, such an assumption can impair the performance of the system. For example, if the exchange of the information is delayed, which can be caused by the uncertainty of the wireless channel, the stable operation of the platoon will be jeopardized. Therefore, to enable autonomous platooning, integrated communication and control will play an important role. Few studies have been reported in the literature such as [124], [125], which jointly studied the communication and control systems in a V2X network, particularly for vehicle platooning. Although control and communication theories are well studied in the past, existing tools are not yet adequate for analysing integrated control and communication design [126]. For example, the fundamental limits of wireless control in real-time applications (e.g., vehicle platooning) are still unknown. On the other hand, the tight interaction between vehicle control and wireless networks is not yet well-understood.

        <p>The design of traditional wireless communication systems heavily relies on model-based approaches in which various building blocks of communication systems are judiciously modeled based on analysis of measurement data. While these model-based approaches have demonstrated their successes in traditional communication system design, there may be some scenarios in 6G-V2X in which accurate modelings (e.g. interference model, accurate channel estimation, etc.) are unlikely [127]. Since ML is capable of extracting the characteristics and identifying (even certain deeply hidden) relationships between input and output data, it can be adopted as a powerful tool in the aforementioned scenarios where traditional communication system design may suffer from model mismatches. Additionally, the data-driven nature of ML can help inferences and predictions about channel dynamics, user behaviour, network traffic, application requirements and security threats, thus leading to better resource provisioning and improved network operation [127]. In addition to the key role that ML plays in improving road safety and driver experiences, the latest progress in ML techniques is advancing the realisation of the autonomous cars [130]. For instance, the data streams of the observed information from cameras, LiDAR's, GPS units, and sensors, can be processed, with which data-driven intelligent decision making takes place through modular perception-planning-action or by end-to-end learning methods for autonomous driving [131]. As far as vision-based ML is concerned, multi-modal reasoning by fusing camera frames and LiDAR scans is investigated in [132] for better object detection to help autonomous driving. While numerous ML-based smart driving applications are expected for future driving, we focus in this paper on the network perspective and highlight the impact of ML in 6G-V2X networks. We discuss the grand vision, significant opportunities, and major challenges of ML, with a key focus on the physical layer, radio resource allocation, and the system security.

        <p>The large Doppler spread may cause very rapid channel fading due to the high mobility, preventing accurate channel estimation. Although linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimation produces optimal performance for linear and stationary channel environments [133], it may not be effective for complicated channel conditions especially in highly dynamic environments. Moreover, since conventional methods generally estimate the channel state information first and then recover the transmit signals, excessive signal processing latency at the receiver may be incurred [134]. From this point of view, ML is envisaged to help improve channel estimation in future 6G-V2X networks. In [135]- [137], deep learning has been adopted to optimize the channel estimation through the training of neural networks. However, due to long training period and large training data, the learning based channel estimation in [135]- [137] includes offline training. In this case, the potential mismatch between the real channels and the channels considered in the training phases could result in performance degradation [128].

        <p>Furthermore, the design of channel codes such as low-density parity-check (LDPC) or polar codes, for example, is usually handcrafted with a relatively simple channel model (e.g. Gaussian or Rayleigh). Such a handcrafted channel code may lead to compromised error correction capabilities when it is adopted over a high mobility V2X environment. In such a scenario, a connected vehicle may experience a rapid variation of interference when it moves from one location to another at a high-speed. Therefore, it is of strong interest to investigate how to efficiently generate channel code on-the-fly for more flexible rates, lengths, and structures which are well adaptive to the rapidly-varying communication environments.Furthermore, the design of channel codes such as low-density parity-check (LDPC) or polar codes, for example, is usually handcrafted with a relatively simple channel model (e.g. Gaussian or Rayleigh).

        <p>The high heterogeneity and dynamics of vehicular networks will increase the complexity of the environment including the varying wireless channels. As discussed, in legacy communication systems, different blocks of the PHY layer are usually optimized independently for ease of design. Such a design paradigm may not be optimal when different QoS requirements (e.g., latency, reliability, spectrum-and energy-efficiencies, and implementation cost) have to be met, particularly over very complex vehicular channels. Different functional blocks at the PHY layer would need to be configured jointly and adaptively according to the dynamically varying environment [128]. For instance, ML-based enhanced adaptive coding and modulation (ACM) is likely for significantly reduced communication latency as well as improved robustness [141], [142]. ML can also be applied to jointly optimize multiple configurations. In this case, an ML-based joint optimization needs to be developed while taking into account the entire end-to-end physical layer architecture [143]. Radio resource allocation, as a classical problem in wireless networks [144], has received tremendous research attention in the past years. Although numerous radio resource allocation approaches (e.g., based on greedy algorithm, game theory and optimization) have been investigated, investigations on RRM are needed to satisfy certain new features of 6G-V2X networks such as high mobility, heterogeneous structure and various types of QoS requirements.The high heterogeneity and dynamics of vehicular networks will increase the complexity of the environment including the varying wireless channels.

        <p>First, the mobility of vehicles leads to fast handovers over the links, leading to frequent resource allocation.

For example, in [147], the prediction capability of ML is adopted to facilitate rapid response to dynamic change of traffic loads. Their proposed ML-based approach is able to predict the future traffic load (about bursty traffic patterns) and assign the available channel to certain links, thus helping avoid potential network congestion as well as rapid channel allocation.First, the mobility of vehicles leads to fast handovers over the links, leading to frequent resource allocation.

        <p>The scarcity of qualified real datasets for vehicular networks is considered as a big challenge for the use of ML [148]. Reinforcement learning (RL) may be exploited when pre-labeled datasets are not available.

Without prior knowledge of handoff behaviour, their proposed RL-based method can achieve rapid and accurate handoff to ensure seamless mobility management. In [150], RL is employed for a user association solution in heterogeneous vehicular networks (i.e., macro, pico and femto cells). It is shown that high data rate with load balancing is attainable by learning an enhanced association policy based on the data of traffic loads and the pilot signal strengths received at vehicles. As indicated in [149] and [150], RL, which does not require prior knowledge of vehicular environment, is expected to attract increasing research attention compared to learning approaches requiring data sets obtained in advance (i.e., supervised and unsupervised learning).The scarcity of qualified real datasets for vehicular networks is considered as a big challenge for the use of ML [148].

        <p>To use RL for radio resource management problems, it is imperative to seek RL solutions that can quickly converge. In this regard, one of the major challenges in RL is the so-called exploration and exploitation dilemma [151]. Specifically, an RL agent has to decide between exploration or exploitation, i.e., whether to explore the unknown states and try new actions in search for better ones for future adoption or to exploit those examined actions and adopt them. While exploration increases the flexibility of the agent to adapt in a dynamic environment at the expense of a possible degradation in the agent's learning accuracy, exploitation drives the agent's learning process to local optimal solutions [152]. When resource allocation problems are modeled with the large state/action space, finding a good tradeoff between exploration and exploitation is indispensable in order to improve computational time and convergence speed [153]. For a large-scale network with multiple vehicles, the state and action space in RL may grow very large. In this case, it is likely that a large number of states are not frequently visited and therefore a much longer time would be required for convergence.To use RL for radio resource management problems, it is imperative to seek RL solutions that can quickly converge.

        <p>To alleviate this problem, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been investigated recently. In [154], multiple parameters of local observations, including channel information of V2V and V2I links and interference levels, are considered to manage the sub-band and power allocation issue. With their problem modeled with a large state/action space, DRL is adopted to extract the mapping relationship between the local observations and the resource allocation-and-scheduling solution. Moreover, DRL is particularly effective in dealing with the high complexity of joint optimization problems that often arise when dealing with wireless V2X resource allocation [155].To alleviate this problem, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been investigated recently.

        <p>It is worth mentioning that a single-agent learning framework is considered in prior art (e.g., see [154]), where each agent in the same network may take its action without collaborating with any of the others [156]. Such independent choice of actions could influence other agents' rewards, hindering the convergence of the learning process [157]. Thus, when ML is applied to a vehicular network with multiple agents, the challenge of competitive collaboration should be considered for effective multi-agent learning. As an example, in [158], the problem of joint channel assignment and power allocation in C-V2X networks is studied with multi-agent learning. When dealing with multi-agent RL, it is often meaningful to use game-theoretic tools [159] to provide fundamental and rigorous analysis of the RL process.It is worth mentioning that a single-agent learning framework is considered in prior art (e.g., see [154]), where each agent in the same network may take its action without collaborating with any of the others [156].

        <p>ML can be adopted for detection and prevention of intrusions. In [162] and [163], supervised learning with classification capability is proposed as an effective mean to identify vehicles' abnormal behavior. It is noted that the training and detection process relies on existing labeled data, and therefore such a supervised learning may be incapable of detecting novel/unknown attacks. In [164] and [165], unsupervised learning which is capable of clustering and does not require labeled data, is considered for real-time detection. Specifically, an intrusion detection by using K-means clustering is proposed for vehicular networks in [164]. To deal with attacks which can dynamically in real-time, anomaly detection using unsupervised learning is studied in [165]. However, since these approaches consider either misuse detection or anomaly detection, they may not be effective in a real scenario where known and unknown attacks can take place at the same time. In addition, reactive detection is mainly considered in the existing detection approaches to save communication cost. However, in a 6G-V2X network where the communication resources are relatively abundant, proactive exploration-based security approaches are expected to be useful for enhanced security level [129]. For example, in [166], a proactive anomaly detection approach is adopted to connected cars for cyber-threat prevention.ML can be adopted for detection and prevention of intrusions.

Specifically, an intrusion detection by using K-means clustering is proposed for vehicular networks in [164]. To deal with attacks which can dynamically in real-time, anomaly detection using unsupervised learning is studied in [165]. However, since these approaches consider either misuse detection or anomaly detection, they may not be effective in a real scenario where known and unknown attacks can take place at the same time. In addition, reactive detection is mainly considered in the existing detection approaches to save communication cost. However, in a 6G-V2X network where the communication resources are relatively abundant, proactive exploration-based security approaches are expected to be useful for enhanced security level [129]. For example, in [166], a proactive anomaly detection approach is adopted to connected cars for cyber-threat prevention.</p>
        <p>Security issues in wireless communication are usually managed in the upper layers of the protocol stack using cryptographic-based methods. However, the management and exchange of secret keys will be challenging in heterogeneous and dynamic V2X networks in which vehicles may randomly access or leave the network at any time [167]. In this regard, one can complement standard cryptographic approaches with physical layer security (PLS) solutions [168]. While PLS techniques exploit the randomness and the physical characteristics of wireless channels to thwart eavesdropping, these methods can be sensitive to channel modeling accuracy. Due to the high mobility and consequently the channel variations in a V2X scenario, ML can be useful for accurate channel estimation and tracking which may benefit the design of more effective PLS-based techniques. Furthermore, depending on the scenarios and services, different security levels are expected. For example, consider two vehicles which follow each other either on a deserted road or at an busy intersection. Due to the vehicles' movement, the latter has a higher amount of factors which may affect the decision making, resulting in stringent security requirements [169]. ML may be employed in the latter case to dynamically decide the required security level as well as the most appropriate PLS solution.Security issues in wireless communication are usually managed in the upper layers of the protocol stack using cryptographic-based methods.

        <p>When ML is adopted to improve the security, ML-based solution needs to be validated with respect to the end-to-end network performance. As already mentioned, ML can be used in functional modules in multiple layers of the networks. Thus, the use of ML should be synchronized across the network [171] to ensure overall secure communications [172].When ML is adopted to improve the security, ML-based solution needs to be validated with respect to the end-to-end network performance.

        <p>A critical issue for efficient applications of ML is the training of ML models, which may be used at the base stations or in the vehicles. The training of large ML models in remote clouds is an obvious solution but could be time consuming. One problem is that the fast changing vehicular network and communication conditions may lead to a slow response to environment changes, thus resulting in degraded performance. Furthermore, most training samples are generated at the network edges such as base stations and vehicles and hence the cost and latency of transferring such data to a remote cloud could be very high. Against this background, local training of ML models is a desirable solution in 6G-V2X networks. As each base station or vehicle may hold only a small number of training samples, joint training of ML models with shared training samples is a potential way to improve ML model accuracy and generalization of performance. However, a major concern for the joint training is privacy, in which base stations and vehicles may not want to compromise by sharing training samples. Federated learning, emerged in recent years to address the privacy and communication overhead issues associated to the training of ML models, has attracted extensive research interests for enhanced wireless networks [173]- [176].A critical issue for efficient applications of ML is the training of ML models, which may be used at the base stations or in the vehicles.

        <p>In the existing research works on federated learning of wireless networks, supervised learning is mainly considered. As reinforcement learning models are more likely to be used, a scalable federated reinforcement learning framework which can cover many different 6G-V2X use cases is needed. In addition, since many V2X applications are mission-critical, it is often not possible to allow federated reinforcement learning to learn from scratch to avoid an unstable phase at the beginning of the learning process. Another challenge of federated learning involving vehicles is the short inter-connectivity between the vehicles. The vehicles may be out of communication range with the base stations or other vehicles which are involved in the federated learning. Hence, the vehicles may need to participate in federated learning while they are parked. Finally, the impact of the wireless channel on the federated learning performance deserves a deeper investigation. As shown in [174], wireless errors and delays can affect the accuracy of federated learning. This effect can be further exacerbated in a mobile V2X network due to the high-speed mobility of the vehicles and the dynamics of the channel. Further research on the joint design of wireless and learning mechanisms for V2X is needed.In the existing research works on federated learning of wireless networks, supervised learning is mainly considered.
