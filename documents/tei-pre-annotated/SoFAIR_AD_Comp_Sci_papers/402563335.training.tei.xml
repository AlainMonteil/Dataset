        <p>Blockchain is one of the disruptive technical innovation in the recent computing paradigm. Many applications already notoriously hard and complex are fortunate to ameliorate the service with the blessings of blockchain and smart contracts. The decentralized and autonomous execution with in-built transparency of blockchain based smart contracts revolutionize most of the applications with optimum and effective functionality. The paper explores the significant applications which already benefited from the smart contracts. We also highlight the future potential of the blockchain based smart contracts in these applications perspective.</p>
        <p>The blockchain is a decentralized, distributed and immutable ledger comprised of a cryptographically linked chain of record collection. The collection of records referred as blocks and the records called transactions or events. The decentralized ledger is shared within all contributory members in the blockchain network. These transactions add to the ledger upon verification and agreement process between the parties on-board in the blockchain. The important features associated with blockchain are the decentralization, immutability and cryptographic link.</p>
        <p>Decentralization:The decentralization of blockchain delegate the authority among the contributors of the network. It is a distinction of the blockchain which ensure redundancy in contrast with the centralized systems operated by a trusted third party. The decentralization ensures the service availability, reduce the risk of failure and eventually improve the trust of service with guaranteed availability.</p>
        <p>Immutability: The records of transactions in the ledger, which remain distributed between the nodes are permanent and unalterable. The immutability is a distinguishing feature of the blockchain from the centralized database systems which elevates to the next level for the integrity of data on the ledger.</p>
        <p>The records are computationally tamper resistant with the existence of the cryptographic links.</p>
        <p>Cryptographic Link: The cryptographic link between each record sorted in the chronological order and the block builds the chain of integrity in the entire blockchain. The digital signature verifies the integrity of each record using hashing techniques and asymmetric key cryptography. The alteration of block or transaction record violate the integrity and eventually make the record and block invalid.</p>
        <p>In addition, cryptocurrencies enable seamless peer to peer payments and proliferate the financial context accentuating as the first generation of blockchain to the world. Cryptocurrencies are virtual and digital currencies secured with digital signatures. Bitcoin [1] is the first prominent cryptocurrency in the world which enables the peer-to-peer financial transactions without the intervention of trusted third party such as international payment channels. The system operates without a third party and the transactions committed to the network are verified by dedicated nodes called miners using the cryptographic techniques.</p>
        <p>Smart contracts are self-enforcing and self-executing programs which actuate the terms and conditions of a particular agreement or contract using software codes and computational infrastructure. Buterin et al. [2] instigated the concept of smarts contract emphasizing the key features with the inaugural deployment in the financial industry. The smart contracts are an extension of the utilization of distributed ledger. The smart contract operates as decentralized programs on the blockchain network. The program is immutable and cryptographically verified the immutability to ensure the trust of the program. The key features of the smart contracts are execution in peer to peer mode without the intervention of a centralized third party and service availability without any centralized dependency. The autonomous execution aligned to the predefined conditions makes the contracts smart rather than paper condition. The smart contracts' features enable the pertinence of them to diverse domains. Many of such features inherited from the underlying blockchain technology. The key features of blockchain based smart contracts can be categorized as follows.</p>
        <p>The blockchain is capable to operating in collaboration with decentralized nodes. The smart contracts enable autonomous execution within predefined conditions. These are the key features to resolve most of the limitations in centralized applications. The decentralization eradicates the single point of failure which ensures the ceaseless service availability. The decentralization also eliminates the extensive data consumption and latency in operations when comparing with the round trip requests of the centralized systems. The decentralization provides transparency in the computational logic eliminating the centralized "Black Box" concept transferring the accountability to all the members.</p>
        <p>The integrity of each transaction and block in the distributed ledger verified with the digital signatures. The forge resistance is a key distinguishing feature which augments the value of blockchain. The transaction record and the computational logic of execution are cryptographically verified and remain persistently over the network.</p>
        <p>Transaction transparency is another significant benefit of blockchain based smart contracts. The blockchain ledger and smart contract logic is visible to all parties in the blockchain ecosystem. The transparency is a differentiating feature of the blockchain which makes it lucrative among the centralized databases.</p>
        <p>The programmed condition and flow of events defined to accomplished execute once the blockchain system reached to the triggering state. The triggering state can be defined in the smart contract upon agreement of all parties in the blockchain network. It can be any condition such as reduced funds, a node reaches a particular geographical location or the system receives a payment. The significant feature is that the execution is automatic and triggered on a condition of the peer without intervening a centralized third party. The service availability is guaranteed since the operation does not rely on a centralized third party.</p>
        <p>The programmed conditions in the smart contracts are immutable and verified prior to the deployment in nodes in the blockchain network. The execution is automatic once the condition is met. The accuracy is guaranteed without any human or any other error on the execution. The autonomous accurate execution eliminates the biased operation and improves the trust through transparent accurate execution.</p>
        <p>The smart contracts facilitate the enforcement of contractual agreements with in-built transparency and forge resistance. The distinguishing features of smart contracts make it pertinent into many applications. A lot of research conducted in the industry as well as academia in order to investigate the strengths and applicability of smart contracts in different application domains. Furthermore, the improvements of technical aspects highly focused to fine tune the smart contracts for the enhancement of compatibility of the smart contracts. There are many smart contract platforms emerging in the market with associated distinguishing features which suits for specific applications.</p>

[15] proposed SMARTPOOL which is a novel protocol design for a decentralized mining pool. The authors implemented and deployed SMARTPOOL on Ethereum and Ethereum classic networks with constructive experimental results. Dai et al. [16] proposed Qtum-framework for a novel smart contract and blockchain-technology solution which uses Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validation. The framework aligned to the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model which used in Bit-Coin. In contrast with Ethereum's account-based model since they highlighted that Ethereum's account-based model has scalability limitations.</p>

        <p>Smart contracts can transform the business rules into the computer programs. Different smart contract platforms have developed to address specific requirements in each industry. Each smart contract platform includes a set of specific features targeted to the particular application. For an instance, Ethereum is mainly developed for the applications which require tokenization. Almost all platforms contain the basic features of a smart contract system including the immutable program code, the decentralized ledger, and the consensus layer. Figure 1 reflects a few leading smart contract platforms. Table 3 summarizes the main application contexts and related works. Table 4 includes a relative comparison of the features of each smart contract platform.</p>
        <p>Ethereum [47] is defined as a distributed computing platform which is composed of a network of computers operating in a de-</p>
        <p>Ethereum Virtual Machine Gas â¢ DigitCoin [37] â¢ Bankera [38] â¢ Pantos [39] â¢ Verses [40] Stellar</p>
        <p>â¢ Tempo [42] â¢ TillBilly [43] Waves â¢ Customized asset trading â¢ Ride sharing</p>
        <p>â¢ TokenEconomica [44] â¢ TradiSys [45] â¢ Multi Chain Ventures [46] centralized, self-governing and democratic manner. Ethereum executes smart contracts and deploys decentralized applications which is called 
            <rs type="software">dApp</rs>. The front-end can be deployed as web application with associated backend as a solidity smart contract. Ethereum uses token such as ERC-20 and ERC-721 to operate with the smart contracts. Ethereum Gas is the unit to measure the computational overheads in the smart contract execution. Gas cost is the monetary value to be spent by the user for a smart contract execution. Gas limit is the maximum price which is the blockchain platform user willing to pay for the smart contract execution.
        </p>
        <p>â¢ Open source system: The governing body of Ethereum does not charge for the source codes. The source codes available publicly and open for the contribution of developers around the world.</p>
        <p>â¢ A worldwide developer community in contribution:</p>
        <p>Huge community of developers contribute to the evolution of Ethereum. The issues and improvements can be publicly handled with the involvement of different developers worldwide.</p>
        <p>â¢ Availability in private and public mode: The Quorum is the private mode of Ethereum blockchain. The users have the capability to decide the operational mode of blockchain as per their requirements.</p>
        <p>â¢ Availability of native cryptocurrency : The native cryptocurrency Ether is available to trade as well as incentivize the members as per the different requirements.</p>
        <p>â¢ Public ledger storage overheads : The public ledger is expected to download when a member node required to connect the network. However, the storage is growing continuously which incur some overheads in the storage for the member nodes.</p>
        <p>â¢ Transaction approval time : The transaction approval time varies from seconds to minutes which will be not supportive to the realtime requirements of transaction processing. For an instance, the retail payments are hard to accept using the Ethereum due to the transaction time.</p>
        <p>â¢ Transaction cost: The computational overheads of smart contract execution determined as the gas cost. The gas cost eventually incur financial overheads to the members in the network.</p>
        <p>â¢ Single programming language support: The programming language of the smart contract limits to Solidity, which is mostly similar to Javascript. The single programming language restricts the experts of other programming languages.</p>
        <p>â¢ Integration limitations:The integration support of the Ethereum yet to be further evolved with different application contexts such as IoT.</p>
        <p>Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned blockchain platform which is designed for the enterprise-grade usage. Hyperledger Fabric was adopted to a micro-service based architecture for convenient deployment. The ledger developed on top of CouchDB no-sql database. The smart contract called Chain-Code in Hyperledger terminology can develope using Java, NodeJs and GoLang programming languages. The microservices of a Hyperledger blockchain network includes peer, Certification Authority (CA) , CouchDB, orderer, and chaincode. Each microservice deployed as a docker container. They are interconnected using remote procedure calls. 
            <rs type="software">Hyperledger</rs> presents an array of specialized versions and utilzation tools for the blockchain platform. Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Indy, and 
            <rs type="software">Hyperledger Sawtooth</rs> are the significant examples. Each version has developed with specialization in different contexts.
        </p>
        <p>â¢ Permissioned operational capability: The permissioned operational capability provides a flexibility of the stakeholders to select which nodes to be operated, scope of ledger, and improved privacy. In contrast, the public blockchain platforms like Ethereum add transactions to the public ledger to make them publicly accessible which will raise privacy flaws.</p>
        <p>â¢ Different modes of consensus (Solo, RAFT, Kafka):</p>
        <p>The 
            <rs type="software">Hyperledger</rs> provides different consensus mechanism integration capability which provides the flexibility to the users. The public blockchain frameworks such as Ethereum do not support custom consensus mechanisms as it will require to customize other member nodes.
        </p>
        <p>â¢ No transaction costs: There are no transaction costs for the Hyperledger blockchain. In contrast with public blockchain such as Ethereum, the transactions will not charge from the members as the blockchain will be deployed on the members' infrastructure.</p>
        <p>â¢ Different programming language support (Java, JS, Go): The 
            <rs type="software">Hyperledger</rs> provides SDK for a flexible integration in different applications.
        </p>
        <p>â¢ Microservice adopted architecture: The microservice architecture provides simplicity and flexibility with the containerization. The containerization provides convenience in the version controlling and other related operations. In contrast, the public blockchain networks are hard to upgrade upon identification of the software issues.</p>
        <p>â¢ Rich queries in the ledger: The transaction data stored in the CouchDB database. The ledger inherits a rich querying capability from the CouchDB.</p>
        <p>There is no native cryptocurrency in the Hyperledger blockchain platform. If it is required, the cryptocurrency should be developed by the smart contracts.</p>
        <p>â¢ Complexity in deployment : The deployement of blockchain platform is relatively complicated in contrast to the platforms like Ethereum.</p>
        <p>â¢ Number of proven usecases are relatively low: The Hyperledger blockchain platform is still evolving by addressing different requirements.</p>
        <p>R3 Corda is a permissioned blockchain platform which can utilize to deploy legalized contracts with privacy preservation. The transactions of Corda platform performed in a legally enforceable manner. The platform is used in a vast variety of applications such as financial, healthcare and so on. The flows, which are the sequences of steps leading to a ledger update define the execution routing of the smart contract.The state of the R3 Corda platform represents the smart contract which corresponds to the real world contracts.</p>
        <p>â¢ Extended privacy prservation: Corda was initially designed to cater the banking industry. The concept of notaries was intended to be operated by the banks. In contrast with the Ethereum, the notaries are the miners who verify the transactions.</p>
        <p>â¢ A broad industrial compatibility: Corda supports for different industrial applications with capability to enforce ordinary contracts as smart contracts.</p>
        <p>â¢ Regulatory and supervisory node support: Corda supports regulatory and supervisory nodes to align with the existing banking ecosystems.</p>
        <p>â¢ Realistic contractual enforcement capability: The corda is convenient for the enforcement of business logic as the smart contract. The platforms</p>
        <p>â¢ Different consensus mechanism support: Corda supports pluggable consensus mechanisms to enhance the flexibility of operations. The consensus mechanism of Corda is twofold, as transaction validity consensus and transaction uniquness consensus.</p>
        <p>There is no native cryptocurrency included in Corda.</p>
        <p>â¢ Verification only through trusted notaries: The trusted notary service aligns the Corda system with the financial services requirements. It can be argued that notaries may drive the system towards trusted third party features, which is expected to be eliminated in blockchain principle.</p>
        <p>The NEM is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency platform which is associated with significant value-added features. NEM has the extra capabilities such as identity proof, timestamping documents, and creation of customized digital assets. The NEM has strong potential to use in industrial applications when comparing with other cryptocurrencies. There are many potential usecases with NEM beyond peer-to-peer value transfer.</p>
        <p>â¢ Built in cryptocurrency: The NEM has its own cryptocurrency XEM which can be used as an asset, like Ethereum.</p>
        <p>â¢ High transaction throughput: The transaction throughput of NEM is relatively higher than Ethereum and Hyperledger.</p>
        <p>â¢ Improved Proof of Importance consensus algorithm:</p>
        <p>The consensus algorithm Proof of Importance is encouraging the participants buy cryptocoins and remain active fort the contribution.</p>
        <p>â¢ Delegated harvesting usage: Delegated harvesting enables more members to contribute for the functioning of network</p>
        <p>â¢ Limitations of the documentation: The documentation and other materials for the NEM blockchain are relatively low when compared with Hyperledger and Ethereum.</p>
        <p>â¢ Comparably less number of tools available: The number of tools for the NEM blockchain is relatively low when compared with the other platforms like Hyperledger Fabric. The Hyperledger platform provides a vast array of tools such as 
            <rs type="software">Hyperledger</rs> composer to easily created blockchain solutions.
        </p>
        <p>â¢ Lacking of community contribution:The developer community of the NEM is relatively low when comparing with the leading platforms like Ethereum and Hyperledger.</p>
        <p>Stellar is a blockchain platform that enables financial transactions beyond frontiers. The Stellar platform provides faster transaction processing time compared with other cryptocurrency platforms. The native cryptocurrency of Stellar is called Lumen. The transaction processing time in association with the concept called Anchors is always less than 5 seconds. The invention utilized the Stellar consensus based on the Ripple consensus algorithm. Even though the smart contract programming language is not Turing complete, the smart contracts can be used to multi-signature transactions and future executions. Turing completeness limitation was explicitly imposed in order to mitigate the security risks of Turing complete programming languages.</p>
        <p>â¢ Cryptocurrency support : Stellar has its own cryptocurrency called Lumen which supports the different operations</p>
        <p>â¢ Pre-generated cryptocurrency : Stellar Lumens are pregenerated. Hence, there is no computataional overhead for mining, such as Bitcoin which will be more beneficial for the users</p>
        <p>â¢ Faster transaction processing time: The transaction confirmation time is 3-5 seconds, which makes it easy to integrate for retail payments</p>
        <p>â¢ Enhanced security through non-Turing complete smart contract language : The capabilities of the non-Turing complete smart contracts are limited.</p>
        <p>â¢ Integration issues with the existing banking systems:</p>
        <p>The Stellar originally intended to use for the financial transactions. There are difficulties with the integration of blockchain with the existing systems such as SWIFT.</p>
        <p>â¢ Regulatory difficulties with the legal frameworks: Since the blockchain is still not evolved technology, there are some regulatory limitations as most of the legal systems do not define blockchain based transactions.</p>
        <p>The 
            <rs type="software">Waves</rs> smart contract platform is a Scala programming language based open-source blockchain platform. It allows users to launch their own cryptocurrency token and facilitates with Decentralized EXchange (DEX). They have introduced the concept of custom application tokens, which is tailor-made for the user requirement. The platform enables users to create, issue, transfer assets, and exchange custom tokens within 5 minutes. The smart contract language used in 
            <rs type="software">Waves</rs> platform is a non-Turing complete language. [48], [49], [50], [51] 15min

        <p>â¢ Custom token creation capablity: The capability to create custom wallets simplify the tokenization market to the new entrants. In contrast with the platforms such as Ethereum, the custom token creation is a distinguishing benefit of Waves.</p>
        <p>â¢ Non-Turing complete language for better security : The Non-Turing complete smart contract language limits the risk of utilization of smart contracts for attacks.</p>
        <p>â¢ Exposed to volatility in the monetary system through custom tokens: The concept of custom tokens may create an artificial volatilty in the market.</p>
        <p>The key application areas and the role of smart contracts are presented in this section. Figure 2 illustrates a quick overview of different smart contract based applications.</p>
        <p>The self-executory, immutable, and distributed nature of the smart contracts revamp the financial industry in a few dimensions by solving many existing issues. Smart contracts guarantee the defined operation to be executed on a certain state of the system and it will be executed without any error. The competitive advantages of the blockchain-based smart contracts for the financial companies are highlighted in [59]. Figure 3 reflects these benefits of the smart contracts in the financial applications. Moreover, Table 5 summarizes the key challenges related to each financial applications and benefits of smart contracts to resolve them.</p>
        <p>Currency is one of the most important elements in the financial industry. Currencies which are declared by a legal tender and controlled by a national central bank are called Fiat currencies. United State Dollars and Euro are well-known examples. Usage of Fiat currencies incurs the stakeholders a lot of overheads such as storage and transportation with high level of security. In the consumer's perspective, the centralized link with the central bank in fiat currency exposes the financial strength of each individual to the government. The government or bank can reverse a committed transaction without consumer's consent too. In addition to that, identity theft has become a major Cryptocurrency is a revolutionary innovation of recent years to address most of these aforesaid issues. Powered by the blockchain technology, cryptocurrency is a digital asset secured with cryptographic techniques and operable with the smart contracts. Since the cryptocurrency is a "digital" asset, robust physical security is not required as the Fiat currency. Cryptocurrency transactions considered as psuedo-anonymous, since the complete identity of the sender and receiver not revealed by a third party, in contrast with the transactions routed through banks. Once committed, the transaction be recorded on a block and distributed among all the nodes in the blockchain ensures that any party cannot reverse the transaction as centralized banking transactions. The cryptocurrency transactions cannot be replayed when comparing with the credit card transactions.</p>
        <p>Bitcoin by Satoshi Nakamoto is the first successful cryptocurrency in the world [1]. Eventhough Bitcoin does not di-rectly support smart contracts, there are several approaches followed by researchers to incorporate smart contracts, such as [60] and [61]. Ethereum [47] is another prominent cryptocurrency innovation. Ethereum is not only a platform which provides a virtual computing environment called Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), but also Turing complete programming language to write smart contracts to run on the blockchain. In currency perspective, Ethereum declares its native token called "Ether" which is a bearable digital asset.</p>
        <p>Hu et. al [62,63] proposed Ethereum based payment solution for rural areas with non-persistent internet connectivity. The transactions were handled by the nodes connected to a local base station and transactions were processed by the miners and periodically connects to the synchronization of balances. Bowe et al. presented ZCash [64], which is an anonymous decentralized payment scheme that allows private transactions on a public blockchain using cryptocurrency. Duffield et al. [65] illustrated Dash which is a privacy-centric cryptocurrency based on Bitcoin. There are significant improvements in Dash when compared with Bitcoin, such as a two-tier incentivized network and which enables private transactions and instant transfers. Rosner et al. [66] identified Ripple as a seamless payment scheme that enables cross-border transactions seamlessly. The authors pointed out the significance of regulatory authorities to regulate the transactions committed on decentralized payment systems.</p>
        <p>Anonymous customers are restricted in almost all banks in the world to prevent money laundering and other illegal activities. Preliminary information such as names, addresses, social security numbers and contact numbers recorded by the banks after a formal customer screening process. If spurious activities are committed by the customers, those activities can trace and map along with their identities for further investigations. Every bank adhered to their own specification of Know Your Customer (KYC) process. This process includes a lot of paperwork and usually does not have a standardize way for cross-bank verification of an individual. The people conceal their identities in money laundering activities due to non-standardization and most of the times banks will be penalized for such criminal activities. In addition to that, the customers do not have authority to control the ownership of data.</p>
        <p>In this regards, the incorporation of smart contracts can emancipate most of the awkward manual operations while enhancing the privacy preservation. Data alterations are traceable by both the bank and customers through the distributed ledger. Customers will have the ownership of data and can control the access to data to eliminate misuse of data. Anyone who need to access the data, has to request permission from the customer. Smart contracts can be used to enable such access dynamically. In addition, the distributed data storage enhances the single point of failure and risk of data loss as well. The blockchain based data storage ensures the availability of the service with its distributed service architecture.</p>
        <p>Ye and Liang [67] discussed the benefits and how the smart contract transformation will revolutionize the banking indus-try. The author suggested that all data should store in the financial institutions in encrypted form and a summarized version of data should be shared to the public ledger. Moyano and Ross [68] proposed a Ethereum based KYC system to reduce the operational cost and enhance the customer experience. The authors also discussed the capability to incorporate permissioned blockchain such as Corda for the system. Alex et al. [69] proposed privacy preserving KYC scheme on Ethereum, which leverages the customer onboarding with compliance to the regulatory requirements. The system defined two smart contracts naming KycProvider and KyceToken. Each smart contract maintains access related information and functioning as standard ECR -20 token for the KYC checks.</p>
        <p>Escrow is an essential service in the online international trading marketplaces. Escrow is a widely used technique to exchange funds in the international transactions. It acts as the trusted mediator in classical international trade ecosystems. Since there is no face-to-face meetings and physical contract establishment in the online international transactions, a trusted intermediary is a mandatory service. Escrow services require a service charge which a certain percentage of the transaction value. The present escrow services have non-realtime settlement processes with non-standardized dispute resolution mechanisms.</p>
        <p>This requirement of a trusted third party in the escrow service is fueling the use of autonomous platforms such as blockchain based smart contracts. Application of the smart contract eliminates the transaction delays. The smart contracts enable near real-time settlements and the embedded rules will charge the penalties for delayed payments and delivery. The distributed service architecture of the smart contract will eliminate the single point of failure and ensure the service availability to streamline the business.</p>
        <p>Peters [70] discussed the blockchain technology, smart contracts and its application in the global money remittance. The author discussed the possibility of multi-signature escrow services with smart contracts. The author also highlighted the key requirement of the smart contracts anticipated in the escrow including accuracy and trust. Bogner et al. [71] demonstrated a decentralized Ethereum based application for sharing tangible objects in everyday use. The solution implemented associating a web application and a mobile application that is capable of reading a QR code displayed on the objects. The system utilizes an escrow service to hold the associated fees as per the requirement.</p>
        <p>Insurance is an essential service to the people for centuries. People insured numerous assets such as properties, vehicles, businesses and their own lives. Any insurance agreement composed of an insurer, organization which provides the insurance and the policy which are often formed as paper contracts have a longer process in agreements. In addition to that, the insurance frauds are accountable as more than 40 billion dollars a year, according to Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) statistics [72].</p>
        <p>The claiming and settlement process takes time which is unfair customer experience.</p>
        <p>The use of smart contracts in the insurance industry will be beneficial in multiple dimensions. The smart contract can be utilized to establish insurance policy terms and conditions in an immutable manner. No human intervention is required to settle a claim. Smart contract based auditing and verification process will be straightforward than the manual process with the globally distributed public and immutable ledger.</p>
        <p>Hans et al. [73] emphasizes the usefulness of blockchain based smart contracts in the insurance industry. Authors stated that smart contacts can speeds up the claim processing and eliminate the administrative costs. The authors also highlighted that still there are some aspects including scalability, flexibility, and permissioned operation to be improved before integrate the smart contract into the insurance industry. B3i [74] is one of the most significant innovations to the insurance industry in collaboration with fifteen giants in the sector. The smart contract based systems improve the insure and re-insure value chain as well as improve customer experience in KYC process.In [75], authours illustrated the possible improvements in the insurance industry by using blockchain based smart contracts. The authors highlighted the enhanced customer satisfaction through unified KYC process, fraud detection since each claim transaction requires to verify by the number of parties to being approved, automation of claim processing, and innovative product integration capability such as micro insurance.</p>
        <p>Guo et al. [76] proposed WISChain, which was intended for web identity security. They provide two insurance service models for web identity security and commercial website security, which enables the claim evidences to be uploaded automatically to the blockchain. [77] illustrated a convenient crop insurance for farmers in Ghana. The smart contracts have been defined to compensate the policyholders due to certain conditions such as drought or rainfall utilizing high resolution satellite images to identify the weather conditions to eliminate fraudulent claims. [78] illustrated Etherisc, which is a decentralized and smart contract based insurance system which defines two types of tokens for economic incentivization and to represent risks respectively. It was utilized Ethereum smart contracts to establish a standardized set of rules to define how stakeholders should function in the system. Vo et al. [79] presented a permissioned blockchain-based solution for the data provenance in car insurance. The system was implemented using the 
            <rs type="software">Hyperledger</rs> Fabric platform. The smart contracts were invoked in capturing events such as weather events, location variations of the car, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>Lending, borrowing and loans are significant economic activities of a civilized nation which are important in the economic development. The economic development made the human needs sophisticated. The lending methods also diversified among different avenues as per the human needs. Peer to peer lending was a famous mode since the ancient economic ecosystems. This was transformed into flexible syndicated products presented by major financial institutions. Here, banks act as trusted third parties. Banks are the only authorized repository of money for lending and dominate the lending market. The current mortgage and loan processing often spans about 60 days [80]. This arduous process includes ascertaining loan applicants' credit scoring, and underwriters' profile verification. [73], [74], [75], [76], [77], [78], [79] â¢ Immutable policies Auditing: [85], [86] â¢ Improved accuracy â¢ Automated audit process â¢ Elimination of specialized human intervention Time and cost intensive verification processes Credit scoring is a manual and non-transparent process Administrative costs Stock Trading: [87], [88], [89], [90], [91] â¢ Transaction transparency In addition to that, the loans were subject to processing fees and few other surcharges imposed by the bank. Some hidden charges can surprise the customers too. Borrowers sometimes escape and refuse to pay back the loan.</p>
        <p>The smart contracts circumvent the existing issues and promise a trust based ecosystem which streamlines the application and payment with automatic execution. The smart contracts can automate the different manual processes which hinder the loan processing, utilizing the distributed ledger. Credit scoring, expense history analysis are few possible solutions which can be ideally replaced with the smart contracts to improve the process. Salt Lending [81] is world's one of the largest lending platforms with market capital of USD 126 millions. The borrowers send collateral to Salt's multi signature wallet in according to enforced conditions automatically. EthLend [82] is an Ethereum based lending platform. The important attributes such as loan terms, fund transferring conditions, and collateral are being handled by smart contracts with ERC-20 tokens. Everex [83] is a Singapore based lending and remittance service. Everex provides a transparent platform for the unbanked customers in South East Asian countries. It uses ERC-20 token which can be pegged with fiat currencies. Debitium [84] is one of the Ethereum based crowdfunding platforms. It facilitates cross border deals and connects borrowers and investors.</p>
        <p>The Auditing is a significant activity in an organization. Due to regulatory requirements, the organizations have to undertake the audit through a trusted independent third party organizations. These organizations charge explicitly for their operations. The audit operation is a tedious manual process which requires substantial human intervention. The derived insights from the audits will depend on human accuracy.</p>
        <p>Audit procedures associated with smart contracts automate the audit procedures and eliminate the additional costs and human errors. The accuracy is guaranteed by the autonomous execution of smart contracts in real-time. Due to the distributed and transparent nature of the smart contract, the regulatory authorities can trust the executory conditions are not being tampered. Also the smart contracts can customize to derive deeper insights for data analytics.</p>
        <p>Zou et al. [85] proposed a blockchain based audit scheme to eliminate forging of audit records. Rozairo et. al. [86] explained the applicability of smart contracts in the auditing procedures. Still the auditing require some more contribution of the blockchain based solutions.</p>
        <p>Stock exchange is one of the most prominent activity in a financial structure. Most of the countries trade stocks valued in millions of dollars per day within traders. These traders are ranging from individual investors to multi millionaire public listed companies. Each transaction executes by intervention of different parties including brokers of the buyer and the seller, clearing houses and transferring agents. The current setup imposes commissions and charges on each player and prone to human errors. Sometimes the settlement is not realtime. Further-more, the fiat currency based architecture operates with centralized governance architecture which limits the market access restricted to the people. The stock trading market access controlled through the registered brokers, which introduced additional overheads of time and cost to the people who are interested in trading.</p>
        <p>The centralized trading architecture can be eliminated by incorporating smart contracts and will enable peer to peer transaction capability for the traders. The terms and conditions can be established transparently by using smart contracts. There is no centralization of trust is required since the ledger is decentralized and the network guarantees the conditions are immutable over the network. Therefore, smart contracts will empower the next generation stock exchanges eliminating human errors, centralization and additional charges incurred on traders along with faster settlement.</p>
        <p>Yermack [87] discussed the advantages of blockchain based smart contracts for corporate governance and how financial asset trading will be benefited from smart contracts. The author emphasized that the improvement of tracking the ownership with public ledger will be accurate in financial recordkeeping with greater transparency as well as improve the liquidity. The author elaborated that countries including the USA and Australia started experimenting with smart contract powered security trading platforms. [88] presented TITA which is an Ethereum blockchain based system which supports commodity trading for manufacturers and consumers. The system defines a token to enable purchases and transfers and incentivizes the token generating contributors of the network. Smart contracts transfer assets or establish escrow conditions as required. [89] is a prominent application of permissioned blockchain based smart contract application for stock exchange in Australia. It provides automated clearing and settlement by smart contracts along with some significant post-trade activities. They provided Digital Asset Modeling Language (DAML) and run privately on a defined set of nodes. [90] and [91] in Hong Kong developed by following the Australian Stock Exchange implementation.</p>
        <p>The research and development in the health care domain have increased the life expectancy. As a result, the number of elderly people in the world who will require periodical medical attention is gradually increasing. New insurance schemes such as Affordable Care Act enrollment in the USA increased the number of patients seeking preventive medicine who were previously reluctant on medical care due to financial constraints. These reasons increased the volume of patients significantly over the the past few decades. Handling such an unprecedented volume of patient data manually is a cumbersome process. Manual processes incur significant administrative overheads and prone to life critical human errors. The digital transformation will eliminate these issues associated with the manual process but exposed to an array of data security threats. If these information systems integrated with prescription drug operations, the complexity and security requirement of the ecosystem will be increased drastically. Therefore, incorporation of the smart contracts to the health care ecosystem will be significantly effective in different dimensions. A quick overview of smart contract applications on healthcare displayed on Figure 4. Table 6 summarizes the applications of smart contracts in the healthcare context along with the benefits and challenges. Candereli et. al [92] explored the opportunities in healthcare with a scientometrics analysis. McGhin et al. [93] presented a comprehensive review on research challenges and opportunities in the blockchain in the healthcare context.</p>
        <p>Modern medical institutions are mostly empowered with automation techniques to handle the myriad volume of patients. The IoT integration is a wider domain including remote treatments and real-time monitoring. These systems generate a massive amount of patient data which is confidential and life critical. But most of the systems in some countries are not compliant with international standards such as the Health Insurance Portability and Privacy Act (HIPAA). Some systems are still rigid and still may require some paperwork. The health information system must ensure data privacy and integrity, as well as availability. These services are indispensable in the health context rather than the other industries because the medical information is highly relevant in invaluable life assets. The blockchain technology and smart contracts can be applied to enable the health information management systems to ensure privacy, integrity and access control to achieve regulatory compliance along with the enhanced patient experience.</p>
        <p>Azaria et al. presented MedRec [94] , a decentralized electronic health record management system which enables the patients to access their medical records across multiple treatment sites. The system is being leveraged by the blockchain and smart contracts, developed on Ethereum platform and manages authentication, confidentiality, accountability and data sharing with a crucial consideration on sensitive patient information. The system is interoperable with existing medical record ecosystems. Nichol and Brandt [95] presents a concept for cocreation of trust in healthcare, using three conceptualized pos-tulations as interoperability, security, and payment. The authors explained with examples clearly how the blockchain based smart contracts will solve different problems in healthcare including the trust establishment and frauds. The authors defined blockchain based smart contracts will be a game changer in future of healthcare.</p>
        <p>Kuo and Lucila [96] presents Modelchain, an adaptation of blockchain based smart contracts for the privacy preserving healthcare predictive modeling framework. The authors designed a framework to integrate online machine learning with blockchains and utilized transaction metadata for the predictive model dissemination. The authors designed a new proofof-information algorithm on top of proof-of-work conesus algorithm to determine the order of online machine learning on blockchain. Dagher et al. [97] proposed 
            <rs type="software">Ancile</rs>, which enables secure, interoperable, and an efficient access control framework to medical records by the patients along with privacy preservation using Ethereum smart contracts. The solution transfers the ownership and control of the patient himself. The system developed with six smart contracts for operations including consensus, classification, ownership of data, permissions and re-encryption and maintains hashes of the records for integrity. The system enables data ownership transfer permission to the patient and compliant with HIPAA requirements. Yue et al. [98] proposed Healthcare Data Gateway (HDG), which is a blockchain powered mobile application allows patients to control the access of medical data by his own to ensure patient data privacy. The authors portrayed the application of Secure Multi-Party Computation on patient data to enable untrusted parties to compute patient data within privacy limits defined. The system used blockchain storage platform to manage data by the patient and the authors discussed about new hopes on 5G to faster data manipulation with enhanced network speed.
        </p>
        <p>Novikov et al. [99] presents a blockchain based smart contract based distributed data register for creation of electronic medical card and an algorithm for the use of smart contracts. The authors have highlighted the establishment of reliability and transparency through blockchain and its significance on the medical information system. The authors suggested Ethereum platform for development of the suggested Integrated Electronic Medical Record register. Alexaki et al. [100] presented a conceptual medical record access and sharing mechanism powered by blockchain based smart contracts. The authors suggested development of the system based on either Ethereum or Quorum, which is the permissioned version of Ethereum blockchain. The authors applied smart contracts for significant roles including identity registration, patient record management and electronic patient record access agreement. Kuo et. al [101] presented an open discussion on the benefits, pitfalls and latest applications of blockchain based smart contracts to the biomedical and healthcare domain. The authors discussed the key benefits including improved medical record management, enhanced interfacing with insurance systems for the claiming process, accelerated clinical and biomedical research and data transparency and enhanced medical ledger with robustness and security. The authors discussed the key challenges of blockchain in healthcare is the publicly available health records.</p>
        <p>Health Information Management: [94], [95], [96], [97] , [98], [99], [100], [101] â¢ Accuracy of life critical operations</p>
        <p>The data integrity of clinical trials is a major concern in medicine. The data integrity defined as the extent which the electronic and paper based data are complete, consistent, accurate, trustworthy, and reliable throughout the data lifecycle. There are guidelines such as International council for harmonization guideline for good clinical practice established to regulate the data integrity in different perspectives. The significant problems of the credibility of scientific data are data loss, endpoint switching, data dredging and selective publication. The treatments due to distorted data will expose the patients into a life risk. The paper based systems do not guarantee the integrity of data. The risk exists of losing the printed or hand-written papers where the data rests. Eventhough the computer systems utilized, still some robust security measures should be applied to prevent data loss and theft. Sometimes, the digital form of data will be more vulnerable than paper written data. The clinical research data repositories associated with smart contracts will be the ideal solution to enforce access control and regulatory compliance.</p>
        <p>Nugent et al. [102] signified the enforcement of regulatory requirements and trust in clinical research data by blockchain based smart contracts using Ethereum platform. The smart contracts, naming as regulator contract and the trial contracts acted as trusted administrators of the system. The authors utilized two smart contracts. The regulator contract holds a data structure for clinical trial authorization while the trial contract is built using functions within the authorization contract. Zhang et al. [103] proposed a framework on managing and sharing electronic medical records of cancer patient care using Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform along with symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques as well as proxy reencryption. The authors proposed that privacy, security, availability, and fine-grained access control over medical data ensured and mainly focused on the secured sharing of medical data, for research or treatment requirements between medical organizations. The smart contracts eliminated the requirement of trusted third party and ensures privacy and access control policy defined by the patient and used encryption techniques to store the data on the ledger. When comparing [103] with [102] , there are significant differences can be identified. [102] was built on Ethereum smart contract, which is a public blockchain. The public blockchain transactions are cost intensive with account management and mining contribution. In contrast, [103] implemented on Hyperledger Fabric private blockchain which provides flexibility for the stakeholders to regulate. For an instance, 
            <rs type="software">Hyperledger</rs> Fabric enables the nodes to define consensus policy according to their preference.
        </p>
        <p>The IoT and wearable devices have been embraced by people from smartwatch to Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN). The WBAN leverages IEEE 802.15.6 and IEEE 802.15.4j standards which were specifically standardized for medical WBANs. The core objective of WBAN is to improve the communication speed, accuracy, and reliability of sensors attached in the immediate proximity to the human body. The WBAN sensors may generate a massive amount of data such as blood glucose level, the pulse rate, blood pressure, and so on. The expansion of such systems raised the requirement of privacy, access control and integrity of data. Each device should be operated with robust automated access control mechanism to eliminate the risk of the patient. Rogue access to the automated patient monitoring and treatment system can kill the patient within few seconds by jamming the treatments. The smart contracts will be the next generation solution to eliminate the risks by controlling access and autonomous safe execution of the treatments in automated patient monitoring and treatment systems.</p>
        <p>Griggs et al. [104] proposed a system which utilizes private Ethereum blockchain and master-slave modeled medical device deployment model. The sensors connected with the smart device, such as either a smartphone or tablet. The sensors can connect to apparatus such as insulin actuators and blood pressure monitors to execute smart contracts and eventually the records will transfer to the immutable ledger. The data received by the smart device is sent to the smart contract, along with the customized threshold values and smart contracts evaluate the data and trigger alerts to the patient, healthcare provider and instructs to the actuator nodes for automated treatment if required.</p>
        <p>Identity management and access control are essential services in every enterprise. The classical identity management systems are mostly centralized and associated with expensive hardware such as smart cards and hardware security modules. Centralised systems will elevate the risk single point of failure and require a robust backup, recovery and disaster management procedures. There are scalability limitations exist in the centralized systems. Sometimes the latency in identity management and access control can be observed when they were connected to IoT devices due to computational power limitations.</p>
        <p>The distributed ledger technologies will be the next generation of identity management and access control systems. Smart contracts based access control systems promise accuracy, high availability, and fault tolerance. Table 7 summarizes the applications of smart contracts in the identity management and access control context along with the benefits and challenges.</p>
        <p>The value of personal identity information is proliferating with the association of modern technologies to the human life. The devices such as smartphones, wearables generate enormous amount of personal data such as location, identity information and so on. Most of the leading applications, including social media used by the people are centralized and the user has minimal rights to control the data. Still most of the users are unaware of the significance of their personal information. The incidents like Cambridge Analytica Scandal reflect that the capability to abuse the personal data without the owners' consent [105]. Data owners should be capable of controlling the access of their data to avoid such incidents.</p>
        <p>The smart contracts are a blessing solution for the access control of identity information and eliminate data theft. The decentralized nature of smart contracts will enable the data owners to control the access of their own data with decentralized and transparent nature. The distributed ledger is applicable to record the access of the individual personal data, which ensures that the data did not access unnecessarily, such as for a third party.</p>
        <p>Banerjee et al. [106] proposed a novel framework associated with blockchain based smart contracts for users to track how is their personal identity information is stored, used and shared by the service provider. The authors developed an automated access control and audit mechanism which enforces users' data privacy when sharing data across third parties. The authors also mentioned that their system can be adopted by big data users to automatically apply their privacy policy on the data flow and track operations. Ouaddah et al. [107] present a blockchain based privacy preserving authorization management framework which enables users to control their own data. The authors implemented the initial implementation on the typical IoT use case on Raspberry Pi. There are few types of transactions used to grant, get, delegate, and revoke access.</p>
        <p>Classical identity management and access control systems such as LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol), IAM(Identity and Access Management) and PKI(Public Key Infrastructure) are aligned with common centralized architecture. The centralized identity management systems developed with privileged access management to the administrator(s) which enable the administrators to manipulate data, central point of failure and expensive perimeter security requirements for compliance. The access credentials associated with private keys will be vulnerable if they are stored in a centralized server, probably in the cloud. Perimeter security requirements will incur costs to the organizations to deploy expensive Hardware Security Modules and tokens with extensive administration and maintenance overheads. If a rogue user disables the centralized service, entire system will be affected.</p>
        <p>Instead of the centralized access control systems, the decentralized system will heal many pains of centralized access control. The smart contracts will provide access to the individual user without invocation of centralized service and in network efficiency perspective, optimal than the centralized systems. The smart contract logic will be transparently deployed and the users can guarantee that their access control or identity information not manipulated by a privileged access management personal. The distributed nature will ensure the service is up and running and cannot be halted by attacking a single server.</p>
        <p>Zhang et al. [108] investigated critical access control issues in IoT and proposed a smart contract based access control system with multiple access control contracts. The authors defined three contract types, as the access control contract, judge contract and register contract. The authors demonstrated the framework using IoT system and a desktop computer. Es-Samaali et al. [109] proposed a blockchain based access control framework to reinforce the security of bigdata platforms. The key features included the distributed nature and lack of central authority with transparency, light weight, fine granularity. They authors defined an authorization token which defines the access right by the creator of the smart contract. SCPKI [110] is an alternative PKI system with decentralized and transparent design used with smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain. The main advantage of the system is to identify the rogue certificates with he web-of-trust model when they are published. The model enables an entity or authority in the system can verify fine-grained attributes of another entity's identity.</p>
        <p>Blendcac [111] is decentralized smart contract based access control solution for devices, services and information in large scale IoT systems. The authors proposed a robust capability token management strategy which utilizes smart contracts for registration , revocation and propagation of access authorization. The authors developed a PoC on private blockchain on the resource constrained devices which is raspberry pi and laptops and demonstrated the feasibility. Lin et al. [112] presented a blockchain based fine-grained access control framework for the Industry 4.0.</p>
        <p>Ali et. al [113] proposed a decentralized access model using blockchain for IoT data using a network architecture naming as modular consortium architecture. The architecture has in-built privacy with adaptability for various IoT use cases. The feasibility and deployment considerations for the implementation analyzed in a performance evaluation of existing blockchain development platforms including Ethereum and Monax. Lee et. al [114] pointed that in the IoT environment, when data or device authentication information appended to the blockchain, there is a risk of the information leakage through proof-of-work process or address searching. They authors applied a zero-knowledge proof to a smart meter system and enabled the transaction processing through disclosing the information such as public key. They authors also studied the avenues to enhance the anonymity of blockchain for privacy protection.</p>
        <p>Security policy is a core regulatory component in any organization as well as Internet applications. The security policy defines the required security controls aligned with the organization's strategic rules and regulations. The depth of access of the users for the infrastructure or resources will depend on the security policy. The centralized security policy and governance architecture is one of the mostly adopted architecture for most of the organizations. With the centralized security policy management, the capability to customization is cumbersome. For an instance, if the employee promoted to the next level, the scope of accessible resources required to expand. Customization of the centralized security policy incurs additional overheads. If the organization deployed beyond frontiers, the overheads will be more. Furthermore, there is a risk of manipulation of centralized security policy without user's consent. [108], [109], [110], [111] , [113], [114] â¢ Privacy enforcement of clinical research data The smart contracts promise the autonomous execution of the program once the predefined conditions met and an ideal solution for decentralized security policy management. The security controls can define as programs and deploy in the smart contracts. The autonomous execution eliminates the overhead of human intervention in the security policy. The distributed nature of the blockchain based smart contract guarantees that the execution logic is not being manipulated by either an administrator or any rogue user within the organization. The decentralization ensures the transparency as well as the availability of the security policy management system.</p>
        <p>Cruz et al. [115] presented a role based access control using Ethereum smart contracts. The smart contracts used for the creation of user role assignments and eventually published to the blockchain. The smart contract provides significant features including managing and modifying information as required in a transparent manner. Outchakoucht et al. [116] proposed dynamic and fully distributed security policy implemented with smart contracts. In addition to that, the authors proposed to apply machine learning algorithms, particularly on reinforcement learning for dynamic, optimized and self-adjusted security policy. The smart contract learns from prior experience to adjust the optimal security policy. Lyu et al. [117] proposed blockchain based access control mechanism in the information centric networking context. Ali et al. [118] proposed blockchain based access control mechanism for conflict of interest domain.</p>
        <p>Commercial real estate industry composed of various transaction types such as leasing, rental and purchases with different asset classes including commercial properties, houses, lands and so on. The government authorities such as national land registry handle all information of the real estate ownership, leasing and so on. Transferring ownership and leasing transactions performed with the intervention of few trusted third parties. Such operations are manual and exposed to human errors, data manipulation risks and extensive processing time.</p>
        <p>Smart contracts will be the next generation solution which will revolutionize the real estate trading industry by a storm with enhanced security and optimized processing time. An overview of smart contracts in real estate context displayed in Figure 5. Table 8 summarizes the applications of smart contracts in the real estate context along with the benefits and challenges.</p>
        <p>Multiple fraudulent transactions can be identified in the real estate industry. When the title of the asset, either a land or house is represented by a printed document, the authenticity of document cannot be easily verified. There are cases where a person can fraudulently duplicate the title document and submit to multiple banks as security asset to obtain a loan. The authenticity of paper title cannot verify in realtime by the current centralized systems. There are cases the land owner sells a land to multiple people using the duplicated paper titles. The key problem is that the authenticity of paper title issued by a trusted third party cannot be verified by the individuals.</p>
        <p>Smart contracts eliminate the lead time for a title transfer and the transparent conditions will hiccup the fraudulent ownership transfer approaches. The ownership information stored in the public ledger and the parties such as banks can verify the ownership of the security.</p>
        <p>Karamitsos et al. [119] examined design of Ethereum smart contract for the use cases of real estate, which is renting residential and business buildings. The authors proposed that the smart contract created between landlords/real estate owners and tenants which verifies that the rental agreement is signed, rental amount paid on time, and the contract terminated correctly. The authors also highlighted the improvement of the invoicing process through the smart contracts and stated that they need to asses the same use case with Hyperledger Fabric. Spielman [120] presented the blockchain application for the land title registry. The key advantages discussed the elimination of the centralized database in the land registry with enhanced security. Since all parties are involved in the consensus, the incapability of fraudulent transactions in the land title ledger was highlighted. Dijkstra [121] presented different possibilities and constraints for the blockchain in the real estate management process. The research conveys that blockchain is still required to improve different dimensions such as government regulation, standardization and so on. The interviews conducted in the research reflect significant insights such as digitally signing the lease contracts and monitoring the obligations via smart contracts are the most important applications of blockchain in the real estate management process.</p>
        <p>The trust establishment of real estate industry accomplished with the intervention of few trusted third parties such as government bodies and banks. These organizations incur processing fees and commissions such as stamp duties for their maintenance. The fees are not negligible when the transaction value is million dollars.</p>
        <p>Improved Secure Transaction Process: [119], [120], [121] â¢ Transaction authenticity Smart contracts eliminate the requirement of a trusted third party since the transfer executes the smart contract itself. Elimination of the trusted third party executes the ownership transfer in real time without processing fees and will reduce unnecessary costs to the consumers.</p>
        <p>Oparah [122] highlighted the importance of smart contracts for elimination of costs incurred by the trusted third party. The cost is around 1-2% of the total value of the property which is not negligible. The importance of smart contract and the enablement to transfer the ownership between two homeowners legitimately without paying for third party verification.</p>
        <p>Current systems are mostly oriented with the centralized authorities. The centralized organizations handle the documents related to the ownership of lands such as titles. Sometimes the documents reside on owner's district or state local authority. This type of architecture consume time to deliver documents to each local authority and update information. In contrast, the smart contracts will execute in real-time or near real-time to transfer ownership which eliminates logistics problem and reduce costs.</p>
        <p>Fernandaz et al. [123] proposed Evareium, which is a smart contract system for trading commercial property.

        <p>Transformation of the government services and legal enforcement into the electronic genre grabbed attention by most of the nations including Europe, Asia, and many other regions. From the electronic services of government, the stakeholders anticipate different features. These include trust, accuracy and improved efficiency as well as user satisfaction. The increased population and complexity of the human needs escalated the requirement of automation to cope with enormous demand volume. Regardless of the service type, the eGovernment solutions handle personal data of the civilians. Uninterrupted service availability is also expected by the stakeholders. Blockchain based smart contracts are one of the most promising solution with significant features for eGovernment services as well as legal enforcement. Table 9 summarizes the applications of smart contracts in the eGovernment and Law context.</p>
        <p>The legal system of any country is complicated and consists of numerous terms and conditions. In a broader view, almost all conditions executed with the direct intervention of judicial personal after a certain assessment. For an instance, if a driver exceeded 10 percent of the speed limit, there is a predefined penalty. If he exceeded 20 percent, the penalty is even higher. The conditional execution intervened with a human. For more complicated cases, the assessment duration is exorbitant which can drag upto years. The human intervention exposes decision to human error. Therefore incorporation of the smart contract for legal enforcement is important because it enables the autonomous and accurate legal execution. However, all the legal terms cannot develop directly as smart contracts. Some straightforward terms are possible to deploy as smart contracts.</p>

        <p>Enforcement of Law by Smart Contracts: [124], [125], [126], [127], [128], [129], [131], [132]</p>
        <p>A contract is an agreement made between two or more parties with legal binding and enforceable by law. Contractual agreements in the business are composed with precisely defined terms and conditions. The terms and conditions are significant to the parties on the contract because they will set rights and obligations as well as price variation clauses for each. Classical contracts formed with the intervention of a trusted third party such as the notary. The on boarding of the trusted third party to form a contract incurs service charges. Most of the times, the trusted third party is a human and hence the risk of human error also exists. The terms and conditions can be manipulated by the third party if required.</p>
        <p>The smart contracts are applicable to solve few issues associated with classical contracts. The smart contracts eliminate the requirement of trusted third party and it will eliminate the service cost of the notary. The terms and conditions can convert into programmable codes and deployable publicly. Terms and conditions are transparent and guarantee that they have not been manipulated. Furthermore, smart contracts can take their decisions of their own. For instance, the imposing penalties can be defined if the terms and conditions breached. Smart contracts are an ideal solution to replace the classical contracts and improve efficiency, effectiveness and security.</p>
        <p>Frantz et al.

        <p>eGovernment refers to electronic implementation of a broader spectrum of public services provided by the government to the citizens. eGovernment services include issuance of identification documents, taxation, insurance, utilities, border control and so on. To establish the trust, most of the eGovernment services developed adapting to a centralized architecture. For an instance, PKI is a vital component in most of the classical eGovernment service. PKI establish the root of trust as the root CA. The centralized eGovernment systems have all of the common issues associated with any centralized systems, including administrative overheads, the central point of failure, expensive perimeter security requirements and so on. The smart contracts will eliminate the major issues mentioned and will provide a decentralized highly available eGovernment system with extended transparency.</p>

        <p>Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the hottest research areas in the recent ear of computer networking history. It is anticipated that billions of devices will be connected in future industries. Many new requirements are identified in different dimensions to facilitate these IoTs. The automation is an essential requirement with the IoT devices in future networks. Improvement of security is also challenging. The requirement of autonomous resource sharing will be a key feature of the next-generation autonomous systems. Blockchain based smart contracts will address many of these challenges in the future IoT systems with its in-built automated and decentralized nature. Smart contracts can be applied to fulfill many security requirements of IoT context. Fotiou et al. [143] illustrated the opportunities and challenges of the smart contracts for the Internet of Things. Figure 6 illustrates the applications of the smart contracts in IoT context.

        <p>Resource sharing is a significant requirement in the IoT network. The resource restrictive infrastructure arises the necessity of optimal resource sharing service. The resource sharing service should not be a resource intensive process. If so, the resource sharing process will incur another overhead on the system. The cloud-based resource sharing mechanism will incur additional network traffic and computational cost. The smart contracts will enable peer to peer resource sharing which is optimal in computation-wise as well as in the network traffic. Thus, smart contracts can be the next-generation resource sharing approach in the IoT context.</p>

The authors developed a prototype which can record transactions in an auditable, transparent and immutable manner. The prototype developed using Ethereum blockchain.
        </p>
        <p>Edge computing enriches the IoT systems in the restricted environment. The Edge nodes associated with IoT systems are capable of being offloaded with computationally expensive operations of IoT into themselves. In contrast with cloud computing, edge computing promises more resource economic operations. The centralized architecture of cloud computing generates more network traffic and contains latency. The blockchchain and smart contracts which operate in a decentralized architecture fit into the Edge computing context for future IoT systems. The peer to peer connectivity eliminates extensive network traffic and latency. The throughput can be increased with the deployment of blockchain based smart contracts with Edge computing deployment model.</p>
        <p>Xiong et al. [148] introduced an economic approach empowered with a novel concept of edge computing for mobile blockchain.

            <rs type="software">Hyperledger Composer</rs>.
        </p>
        <p>Security is a crucial requirement in the IoT context. With the resource restricted hardware, it is extremely hard to enforce security by increasing the key sizes with multiple cryptographic operations. The devices are constrained in the form of computational power as well as memory. Hence utilization of publickey certificates will be an expensive operation to the IoT devices. The PKI systems may require verification through the requests sent to the cloud servers which will generate the network traffic. The access control and privilege definition on the centralized servers will be vulnerable. Overall, the blockchain enables the stakeholders to embed access control policy on the smart contracts and deploy in a decentralized manner. The code is immutable and free of being modified in contrast with the cloud computing environment. The decentralized operation ensures that no extensive network traffic will be generated when the security is being enforced.</p>
        <p>The trust management of IoT ecosystem is vital security consideration. The mission critical application contexts such as healthcare, smart cities, and vehicular networks require high end trust establishment for the IoT nodes in operation. The trust management includes the different services such as the trust establishment, realtime trust assessment, trust withdrawal upon the malicious practices and so on. The future IoT infrastructure will connect billions of devices in realtime and the trust management frameworks expected to scale up aligning the massive connectivity requirement. The centralized trust management is challenging with the future demand expectations. In addition to that, the computational resource restrictions shift the highlevel IoT infrastructure design decisions towards decentralized architectures such as edge and fog computing based designs. The distinguishing features of the blockchain based smart contracts promise significant value additions to the classical trust architecture, addressing the limitations of classical trust ecosystems in IoT.</p>

        <p>The data privacy is a vital concern in almost all applications. The core principles of blockchain include the public decentralized ledger which includes transaction data. However, these public transaction data may raise privacy issues in the perspective of data owners. These privacy requirements need to be addressed carefully without impact on the other features of blockchain, including performance requirements.

        <p>The performance factors are essential considerations in the application perspective. The performance requirements of high volume transaction processing are mandatory for applications such as digital payment systems. The transaction verification times for the major blockchain platforms such as Ethereum and Bitcoin hindered the applicability to the retail payments. In contrast, the payment networks such as Visa provides 7000 transactions per second. However, a lot of research in progress to investigate techniques to enhance the performance features of blockchain.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The previous section discussed the significant technical aspects and features of smart contracts based applications. This section extends that discussion by elaborating learned lessons and future research directions for further improvements. The Figure 8 portraits an overview of the flow of lessons learned and future works. Different applications of blockchain based smart contracts in the financial context was discussed previously. However, several aspects of blockchain based smart contracts are still required to be improved further. Governments and governing institutes still do not fully recommend smart contracts for the utilization of fund transfers. The lack of regulating capability in decentralized systems is the main reason for the government bodies reluctant to fully approve the smart contracts in the financial context. Escrow services also have the same decentralization features and still not adopted by the government bodies for International fund transfers. Eventhough the Bitcoin and Ethereum are not fully adopted by the government bodies for fund transfers, the smart contract platforms like Stellar is still working for the fund transfers beyond borders.</p>
        <p>It is essential to reduce the transaction processing time if the blockchain is used for retail merchant payments. For instance, Bitcoin and Ethereum take a few minutes for the completion of transactions which is not preferred to experience in the quick merchant transactions. The transaction validation time has to be retained as minimal as possible eventhough the ledger is evolving with the transaction count. It is mandatory to integrate blockchain platform with mobile devices in order to adopt more users. For the merchant retail payment systems with smart contracts, it has to compete with Visa or MasterCard like centralized high-end payment processing systems. Therefore, the further optimization of transaction completion requires to be considered before integrating the smart contracts for financial transactions. However, the smart contracts will be ideal for the financial transaction enablement of closed-loop financial ecosystems such as rural and undeveloped regions.</p>
        <p>The decentralized smart contract based KYC systems will be attracted by the future banks as a single customer data sharing platform. However, if the legal policies can be defined to regulate the customer data, the trust of the decentralized KYC systems will be elevated and more customer satisfaction can be anticipated. For the stock exchange, the smart contracts will be an ideal candidate since it enables the autonomous operation. The improvement of the transaction processing time is required for further adaptation.</p>
        <p>For lending and borrowing, smart contract systems can play a vital role since lending and borrowing does not require a realtime operation. The autonomous settlement which can be enabled with the smart contracts will be value addition and eliminates fraud. The insurance also will be benefited by the smart contracts by executing the claims autonomously by data inputs and eliminating frauds. The transparency of the transaction records will be advantageous when the auditing procedure of the smart contract integrated systems is considered. The trans-parency can be a drawback also to the financial context since the transaction records are visible to the public and some customers can be discouraged to share the personal transaction details with the public. The traceability and autonomous execution will make the audit procedure independent and transparent. The main features of the smart contract systems are autonomous execution, elimination of third party intervention and transaction transparency in the financial context.</p>
        <p>The future of financial transactions requires a robust intervention of the governing bodies to regulate the smart contract based financial transactions. Eventhough the decentralized nature preferred by the stakeholders, the government requires to monitor and establish rules and regulate to make the smart contract based financial transactions acceptable by the citizens. The improvements on the consensus anticipated when the smart contracts on board for the financial transactions. The transaction delays such as Bitcoin and Ethereum has required to eliminate if the smart contract based transactions are applying to retail merchant transactions. The computational resource consumption requires to optimize to eliminate the mining overheads in the financial transaction context. The future smart contract based financial systems required to design with formal auditing procedures and compliant with PCI-DSS(Payment Card Industry -Data Security Standards) and PA-DSS(Payment Application-Data Security Standards) standards for global acceptance. However, operating the smart contract based financial systems in a closed loop system such as a village, within an unbanked customer segment will help to identify the drawbacks in the real world operation. These drawbacks required to correct before the operation of smart contract based globally accepted payment systems.</p>
        <p>The different applications of smart contracts in the healthcare context discussed previously. The patient data protection and health information management have a lot of inspirations on smart contracts. The access control to the patient data can implement with the smart contracts with decentralization. Elimination of the central point of failure is beneficial for the mission-critical healthcare systems. Health-information management applications with the smart contract incorporation must comply with health data protection standards such as HIPAA. Privacy highly considered in health data management systems. In addition to that, the data integrity of protected data required to ensure utilizing smart contract systems.</p>
        <p>The smart contract based data sharing mechanisms must ensure privacy and integrity for the data in transit. The accuracy of the operation of automated patient monitoring and treatment systems required to improve since the smart contract applied with life critical operations. The smart contract developed for healthcare systems must be checked for the bugs, vulnerabilities, and accuracy. The formal verification can utilize to verify the operational accuracy of smart contracts for the healthcare systems. The different aspects of the smart contracts must consider such as the stability of the operations on a load, memory usage on the execution of the contract and so on. The smart contract systems for the future healthcare systems mostly expected to operate on private mode rather than public blockchain operation. The data integrity and immutability of transaction data are the major expectations of smart contracts for the healthcare systems.</p>
        <p>The future research of smart contracts focused on the improvement of privacy of health information management systems. The compliance with regulations is a major consideration of the incorporation of smart contract systems for healthcare. The privacy improvement along with the transparency requirement of blockchain based smart contracts is an important research direction. The secure data sharing schemes between third party organizations such as insurance companies required to improve the techniques such as oblivious transfer, secret sharing schemes. The next generation healthcare systems require synergestic operation with the services of smart city such as secured data sharing and eGovernment services. The data provenance respect to the sharing of private medical data is achievable with the immutable ledger. Since the accuracy of smart contracts developed for patient monitoring and treatment is highly anticipated, the applicability of formal verification was highlighted previously. The specialized formal verification methods for the healthcare systems are an important research area in the future.</p>
        <p>Identity management and access control contexts have numerous applications with smart contracts. The data currently stored in centralized systems that have many issues associated. Elimination of the centralization is the main advantage that attracts smart contracts for identity management. The users' capability to control the access of their own data improves trust. The hardware costs for centralized systems such as HSMs can eliminate through the decentralization. However, the incorporation of national identity management systems with smart contracts will require further amendments in the legal systems. The legal systems which recognize the digital signatures and electronic identification are not compatible with decentralized smart contract-based identity management and access control systems. Therefore, the regulatory bodies required to enrich with the operational capabilities, strengths and weaknesses of the smart contract-based access control system and define them legally. Then the smart contract based access control systems are extensible even internationally. The identity data protection solutions empowered with smart contracts require to ensure that they have aligned with local identity management standards. The security policy definitions with the smart contracts are the ideal use cases since through decentralization, the trust can establish. The consensus mechanisms and other dependencies required to be further improved for the efficient operation of identity management systems with smart contracts.</p>
        <p>The Identity management system will be capable of automated identity management and access control in future. The synergetic operation with PKI based existing identity management systems will eliminate integration and adaptation hurdles. The decentralized identity management and access control systems must ensure the alignment with existing legal requirements in identity data protection. The data privacy must be guaranteed and it may be required to integrate with existing PKI systems which attached with HSMs. The smart contract based identity management systems are extensible as the national identity data repository of citizens. The access can be controlled by the users and the service providers such as banks, telecommunication services, and insurance can retrieve the data from the repository with the data owner's consent. The data usage records must transparently available in the ledger to ensure the data owner that his data was not transferred to third parties such as trade promoters and so on. The identity management systems must interface with the mobile devices which will enhance the usability of decentralized access control systems. The data access policy is a subject to define by the data owners. The consensus and storage systems must design with scalability provisions since the identity management systems will expand along with the number of users.</p>
        <p>The main objectives of smart contracts in the real estate domain are to eliminate the trusted third party and reduce the transaction time. The centralized automated systems may currently in use and the smart contract-based real estate systems required to integrate with the existing legacy systems. However, the real estate information owned by the property owners must restrict in availability to the public. The property ownership transfer operations required to execute immediately but do not require to be realtime such as retail merchant transactions. Thorough attention may not require to optimize the consensus for the enhancement of realtime transfers of property as per the merchant transactions.</p>
        <p>However, the extensive transaction processing time in some of the legacy systems in the present required to eliminate. More improvements required on the enhancement of data privacy, secure data sharing with third parties such as banks and other regulatory authorities as well as customer-oriented decentralized access control to the property data. Since the systems are operating in decentralized mode, the computational and storage overheads as per the centralized systems required reduced and this advantage should be beneficial to the system users. The service fees required to reduce as encouragement to the customers for the usage of proposed decentralized systems. The legal recognition and regulation with the government body without charging fees will encourage the users to adopt the system. The smart contract systems for the next generation real estate domain may require to incorporate with PKI based eGovernment systems currently in use for the legal recognition.</p>
        <p>The smart contract based real estate systems may need legal recognition in order to operate as a national real-estate management system. To legalize, the existing definitions must be identified and the smart contract system must be designed with the provisions for the legal recognition. The integration with existing PKI based electronic identity is a prudent solution to legally onboard the smart contract-based real estate system. The gap between the smart contract system and mobile devices required eliminated to increase usability. The mobile devices should be capable of instant verification of the property record such as the title report. However, the applicable use cases of mobile devices should be identified. Eventhough the system is decentralized, multiple ownership transfers required to eliminate. The response to the attacks and the availability of the system should ensure before deployment. The data backup and recovery procedures must verify for the functionality when the system is deployed in a production state.</p>
        <p>The utilization of smart contracts for the eGovernment and Law related services is advantageous in different dimensions. Transformation of government services into the electronic form is one of the key strategic decisions in the national authorities in order to enhance efficiency and improve data security. The costintensive centralized solutions can eliminate with blockchainbased smart contracts integrated solutions. The distinguishing features such as transparency, fairness and autonomous execution will ensure the trust and attract the users as well as regulatory authorities for the smart contracts for eGovernment services.</p>
        <p>The privacy of data requires to enforce and the access control policy to the data required to be controlled by the users to obtain true decentralization. The scalability of the system is essential consideration since the eGovernment services are national scale solutions. The systems require to design with the regulatory bodies also including the service nodes of the blockchain system. Furthermore, the branches of government authorities can further continue with their decentralized domination with the contribution of block generation. Since transparency is a major consideration in the smart contracts for eGovernment services, the programs must be developed with simplicity for a clear understanding of the users and regulatory authorities.</p>
        <p>The future of smart contracts for eGovernment services will improve the quality of human life in different aspects. Essentially, with the development of smart cities in the future, the blockchain-based eGovernments services will operate in association with the smart cities. The integration of mobile devices will be a major design principle in the future. The decentralization will enable the peer to peer operational modes for the simple services. The transparent distributed ledger will eliminate the requirement of auditing as an explicit attempt. The citizens will have a unique decentralized identity management system that can be interfaced with other eGovernment services such as utility services, transport, banking. From the users' perspective, user experience requires improvement without repeating the data capture before a government service. The transparency of smart contracts is the most prominent feature of smart contracts for the enforcement of law. Through transparency, citizens can establish trust. Furthermore, through automation of smart contracts, will be the most promising solution for automated fine calculation in legal violations.</p>
        <p>IoT will be one of the most prominent application contexts in the Industry 4.0 revolution. Billions of devices will connect in future industrial ecosystems. Blockchain-based smart contracts integrated architectures add a lot of values to the next generation IoT ecosystems which cannot be obtained by the centralized services. The scalability and decentralization anticipated in the future IoT systems. When the smart contracts integrated with the systems, the computational overheads required to reduce since the resources are constrained in IoT devices. The consensus functions required further optimization for the smart contract integration of IoT systems. The integrations of Edge computing nodes for the smart contract service deployment are an optimal and secured design principle. Furthermore, the security requirements including privacy should be properly identified and addressed for the massive data volume generated by the IoT systems. The robust security measures required to established on the IoT systems such as UAVs in operation to prevent the cyber attacks and eventually with optimal security.</p>
        <p>The smart contracts with Edge computing nodes will be a significant design principle in future IoT ecosystems. The computational overheads of a smart contract system, such as block generation require to handle on the Edge computing infrastructure. The future blockchain systems required to design with enabling provisions for the Edge node connectivity. Edge computing integration interfaces should be designed with compatible protocols such as COAP for the existing blockchain systems. The existing connectivity protocols must be diversified with optimal protocols such as gRPC. The integration compatibility of future IoT systems must improve since IoT will be a major contributor in future smart cities.</p>
        <p>The applications for the blockchain-based smart contracts for the telecommunication industry still require maturity. The computational overheads and the limitations of the real-time operation deviate the applicability of smart contracts for telecommunication. However, some services such as slice leasing, spectrum sharing mechanisms are still applicable since they are onetime operations. The smart contracts require further optimization if it requires to execute on the resource-constrained devices such as smartphones. Since the telecommunication services are large scale operational services, the reliability of the smart contract system requires proper testing. Once the realtime operational capability of the smart contract systems achieved, more opportunities can open in the telecommunication context for the blockchain-based smart contracts.</p>
        <p>The blockchain-based smart contracts are a blessing solution for the future of telecommunication since the exponential growth of subscribers is anticipated with the industrialization. The enormous volume of mobile subscribers including the industrial sensors requires the scalability of communication infrastructure. Access control to the user data can ensure through blockchain based smart contracts. The access control system will enhance the user satisfaction of users. The data repositories are extensible as the globally accepted identity information system for telecommunication service in the future. If so, multiple MNOs can utilize the smart contract-based user data repository to eliminate repetitions in customer data capturing. This data repository can integrate with a smart city ecosystem and usable to track and trace the activities of users on-demand for scenarios such as legal actions. The 6th Generation (6G) is emerging with the promises of higher bandwidth and microsecond latency. The 6G will embrace the blockchain technology to utilize the decentralization and immutability of ledger in different use cases. The scalability requirements in the future 6G context will expect to divert from the centralized computational service architectures.</p>
        <p>The main features of the blockchain-based smart contracts for the logistics and supply chain industry are the data provenance and decentralized autonomous operation. The data provenance is important to evaluate the alignment of the delivery with the regulatory requirements of a particular commodity beyond frontiers. The emergence of IoT infrastructure will increase the usability of blockchain based smart contracts in the logistics industry. The blockchain based smart contract systems required to improve further in order to integrate with the logistics systems. The systems required to incorporate with mobile applications to improve usability. For instance, the supply chain milestones of agricultural products such as vegetables, fruits, and fish can store in the blockchain and view the supply chain to the customers via mobile application. Instead of developing the blockchain alone, the integration is required to consider. The efficiency of smart contracts requires optimization in the autonomous execution enablement of smart contracts in the logistics context.</p>
        <p>The blockchain-based smart contracts widely applied for the data provenance of the logistics and supply chain industry.

Cross Industry 5.9.1. Lessons learned Data provenance and autonomous execution are significant features that utilized widely in the industry. The blockchain based smart contracts and their utilization for IT security is a vital application. The decentralized operational capability distinguishes the blockchain-based smart contracts from centralized security solutions such as intruder detection and prevention systems. The failure risk is minimal with the smart contract integrated systems in contrast with the centralized solutions. The energy industry has a significant adaptation of blockchain based smart contracts since the autonomous execution can utilize for a lot of use cases such as smart metering, energy trading and so on. The supply chain use cases such as automotive industry and environmental protection are mostly dependent on IoT infrastructure. The improvements required for IoT will be effective for the agricultural and special commodity supply chain traceability and data provenance use cases. The lower response time with highest accuracy is required when the smart contracts are applicable to mission-critical services like aviation. The testing procedures such as formal verification, load testing, vulnerability assessment requires to conduct thoroughly when the smart contracts are incorporated to the industry like aviation.</p>
        <p>There are more opportunities in the industry for the blockchain based smart contracts. A lot of research-in-progress to explore more avenues of smart contract applicability. The improvements of smart contracts such as reduced latency, higher throughput and scalability will attract smart contracts to many industries. The industries such as space research and the military will have more opportunities for blockchain based smart contracts.</p>
        <p>The applicability of smart contracts in the different sectors is an interesting research topic. The features of blockchain based smart contracts enable a great number of applications to be integrated with in future. The applications which have potential in future blockchain integration discussed. The Figure 9 portraits the future context of smart contracts.</p>
        <p>The blockchain based smart contracts have a disrupting applicability to the transport industry. The taxi and ride sharing is a significant example. When comparing with the centralized taxi services, the decentralized operational capabilities of the smart contracts provide scalability of the service with ensured service availability. The decentralized distributed ledger provides transparency of events which is eventually usable in dispute resolution. The autonomous execution provides efficiency and minimizes the human intervention in most of the operations such as booking and settlement processes. The transparent ledger provides accountability which is expected in the transport sector in some cases. However, the privacy and access control required to be implemented in the integration of the blockchain for ride sharing.</p>
        <p>The trade prediction plays a vital role in the international foreign exchange and commodity markets. The prediction frameworks developed with the market insights and mostly integrated with machine learning techniques. The centralized machine learning techniques have limitations in the scalability and there are privacy concerns in the training data. The smart contracts can be incorporated for the trade prediction frameworks in future to eliminate most of the drawbacks encounter in the centralized techniques. The decentralization enhances the depth of crowdsourcing insights for sharp prediction frameworks. Furthremore, with the incorporation of decentralized machine learning techniques such as federated learning, the prediction frameworks can be further fine tuned for accurate predictions in the future.</p>
        <p>There are diverse hidden opportunities in the sports which can be utilized with the smart contracts for the improvement of service. The blockchain and smart contracts are applicable to the data provenance of the sports memorabilia, such as authentic jersey and head gears . The authenticity is verifiable using blockchain. The Non Fungiable Token (NFT), which is a non-interchangeable token is usable to represent the authentic assets. The blockchain based smart contracts are further applicable to store the historic performance data of the players. This is important when the players transform from the national contests to the international events such as Olympic games. The historic records of the performance in games with ensure the compliance on the drug testing history of players along with the access control mechanisms powered by the blockchain based smart contracts. The indirect services, such as telecasting access rights can be managed through the smart contracts in sports.</p>
        <p>Charitable organizations operate to improve the social wellbeing for the needful people in the world. Mostly, the cost intensive requirements such as subsidizing the poor people, needs of the children fulfilled by the donations of the public. Public donations such as automated credit of the accumulated loyalty points is currently a widespread approach in fundraising for the charity. However, the blockchain based smart contracts improve the transparency in the automated credit of the loyalty points for charity. Furthermore, the blockchain provides fundraising through ICO (Initial Coin Offering) for the charity organizations. The establishment of smart contracts to utilize cryptocurrency for the expenses improve the transparency. The transparency is one of a major advantage in the smart contracts in the application perspective of charity since the public owes a right to transparently oversee the expenses of charitable organizations as the public funded them. In the form of dispute resolution and fraudulent commits of the charitable organizations can be eliminated through the blockchain based smart contracts.</p>
        <p>The capabilities of blockchain and smart contracts for the context of human resource management eliminate most of the current issues exist . The distributed ledger provides a ondemand accessible transparent record repository to track the significant events of the employees. The employers have ondemand access to the repository for the background checks of employees in the recruitment process. The access control to the data can be established using the smart contracts. Furthermore, the employee payments can be handled through the smart contracts with transparency and accuracy. The employee payment handling through the smart contract enhances the value of employee contracts based on commissions or any other performance evaluation criteria. Through the smart contracts, the employees and employers are visible on the evaluation criteria with convenience in dispute resolution requirements. The integration of in-house payment systems with the smart contracts streamlines the human resource and financial management workflow with guaranteed accuracy.</p>
        <p>Eventhough the world is moving towards the digital era, the reading of books remains sticked with the lifestyle of most of the people. The libraries play a vital role globally to enhance the reading. The libraries lend the books to the readers to share the knowledge. The blockchain based smart contracts have potential to enhance the value of services such as lending. Incorporation of blockchain based smart contracts can enable the peer to peer book sharing between members without the intervention of centralized authorities. The compensation for the delayed returns can be handled by the smart contracts transparently. The authors are capable of being rewarded as per the popularity of the publications. The inter-library lending processes can be enhanced with the incorporation of blockchain based smart contracts.</p>
        <p>The application of blockchain based smart contracts open up many opportunities for the photography. Especially, in the digital era, almost all the photographs uploaded and shared over the internet. The blockchain is applicable to store the metadata of photographs, such as location information, capturing hardware, and resolution of the photographs transparently. The smart contracts are applicable to access control the metadata for on-demand retrieval and exchanging as per the requirement, such as for the competitions. Furthermore, the photographs can be monetized by the integration of smart contracts and enable to trade in the marketplaces along with processes like auctioning.</p>
        <p>The video content and their sizes expected to be exponentially expand in the future with emerging technologies such as VR(Virtual Reality), 360 degree videos and ultra high definition in future. The number of video streaming service subscribers will be increased with diversified video content in the future. The centralized video streaming servers will have limitations in the scalability to serve the future requirements. The streaming from centralized servers will incur costs for the internet service providers. The streaming lags from the centralized servers may reduce the nature of the content. Furthermore, the access control and rights management of the content creators from centralized servers will expose to central point of failure.</p>
        <p>The blockchain based smart contracts can facilitate the service with decentralization with efficient data consumption in streaming. The content rights management and subscription of the premium content are easily manageable with the decentralized smart contracts. The customized advertising based on user preference and the location efficiently managable through blockchain based smart contracts.</p>
        <p>The eSports market is expected to boom with millions of users in future. The eSports will encounter the scalability limitations in the incentivization, user identity management, and access control related operations with the rapid growth of demand. The blockchain based smart contracts will improve the player identity management, access control and provide transparency to eliminate dispute resolution in any case. The fan incentivization can be handled easily with the tokens supported by the blockchain. The tokens can be used to trade the monetized components of eSports. Furthermore, the entertainment techniques such as casinos can be regulated and audit with the incorporation of smart contracts. The dispute resolution is straightforward when the smart contracts incorporated.</p>
        <p>Weapons and ammunition is utilized in domestic and national scale in some countries. The accountability of guns, volume of ammunition, their licensing information and the usage statistics are significant information on the establishment of national security. The blockchain based smart contracts provide transparency in the license information, usage statistics, ownership information of the guns with decentralized access control to the regulatory authorities such as Police, government administrative authorities and so on. The regulation of the usage in the national and international scope is also possible with the blockchain based smart contracts. The authorities such as United Nations can define the smart contracts to regulate the usage of ballistic missiles and rocket launchers as an international governing body.</p>
        <p>The paper provides an extensive survey on applications of blockchain based smart contacts. The significance of smart contracts is distinguished due the rich set of features such as decentralization, forge resistance, transparency, autonomous execution, and accuracy. As a result, blockchain based smart contracts are used in wide rage of applications domains such as financial, healthcare, eGovernment, IoT, telecommunication, logistics, and different industrial contexts. Several blockchain platforms such as Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, Corda, NEM, Stellar, and Waves are available to deploy smart contacts with unique applicability features into the industry. Moreover, it is expected that more platforms will be emerged targeting specialized application domains. However, there are few challenges that smart contracts have to resolved before the large scale deployments. These challenges includes scalability, data privacy, lack of governance, computational overheads, storage overheads, and network overheads. Future research on smart contracts should be focusing on these challenges. The future research avenues are available to investigate the optimizations of consensus mechanisms, data usage efficiency, lower latency, minimal storage overheads with extremely lower latency in transaction processing.</p>
