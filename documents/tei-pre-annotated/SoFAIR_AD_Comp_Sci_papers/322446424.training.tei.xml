        <p>Background: Web-based sources are increasingly employed in the analysis, detection, and forecasting of diseases and epidemics, and in predicting human behavior toward several health topics. This use of the internet has come to be known as infodemiology, a concept introduced by Gunther Eysenbach. Infodemiology and infoveillance studies use web-based data and have become an integral part of health informatics research over the past decade.Background: Web-based sources are increasingly employed in the analysis, detection, and forecasting of diseases and epidemics, and in predicting human behavior toward several health topics.

        <p>Of the 338 studies, the vast majority (n=282, 83.4%) were published with JMIR Publications. The Journal of Medical Internet Research features almost half of the publications (n=168, 49.7%), and JMIR Public Health and Surveillance has more than one-fifth of the examined studies (n=74, 21.9%). The interest in the subject has been increasing every year, with 2018 featuring more than one-fourth of the total publications (n=89, 26.3%), and the publications in 2017 and 2018 combined accounted for more than half (n=171, 50.6%) of the total number of publications in the last decade.

        <p>The field of infodemiology is becoming increasingly popular, employing innovative methods and approaches for health assessment. The use of web-based sources, which provide us with information that would not be accessible otherwise and tackles the issues arising from the time-consuming traditional methods, shows that infodemiology plays an important role in health informatics research.The field of infodemiology is becoming increasingly popular, employing innovative methods and approaches for health assessment.

        <p>Infodemiology (ie, information epidemiology) is a field in health informatics defined as "the science of distribution and determinants of information in an electronic medium, specifically the Internet, or in a population, with the ultimate aim to inform public health and public policy" [1]. The first official mention of infodemiology according to a search in PubMed (ie, baring the term on the title) was by Gunther Eysenbach in 2002 [2]. However, infodemiology studies (ie, assessment of health-related topics using web-based data [3]) can be traced all the way back to 1996. Two more studies in the 2000s use the term (PubMed): one in 2004, where the quality of hospitals' websites was assessed [4], and one in 2006, showing that flu data from Google correlated with influenza cases [5].Infodemiology (ie, information epidemiology) is a field in health informatics defined as "the science of distribution and determinants of information in an electronic medium, specifically the Internet, or in a population, with the ultimate aim to inform public health and public policy" [1].

        <p>The large corpus of publications in infodemiology were present after 2009, with the first complete presentation and assessment of the subject being found in the scoping review of Bernardo et al [6] published with JMIR Publications-the main publisher of infodemiology and infoveillance studies.The large corpus of publications in infodemiology were present after 2009, with the first complete presentation and assessment of the subject being found in the scoping review of Bernardo et al [6] published with JMIR Publications-the main publisher of infodemiology and infoveillance studies.</p>
        <p>Social media and search queries are the most popular sources for retrieving information from web-based sources. The use of social media is constantly expanding [7], with more users and including more features. Search query data is also of significant value, as they take into account the revealed and not the stated users' preferences [8,9], but methodology should be designed with caution to ensure the validity of the results [10].Social media and search queries are the most popular sources for retrieving information from web-based sources.

        <p>Popular social media data sources in infodemiology include Twitter [11][12][13][14][15][16][17], Facebook [18][19][20][21][22], and Instagram [23,24]. Queries from search engines are mostly retrieved by 
            <rs type="software">Google Trends</rs> [25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32], as well as Yandex [33][34][35], Baidu [36,37], Bing [38], Yahoo [39], and Daum [40,41]. Other popular sources include websites and platforms [42][43][44][45]; blogs, forums, and online communities [46][47][48][49][50][51][52]; and, what has received attention lately, mobile apps of certain health categories (eg, asthma [53] and heart failure self-care management [54]). Significant focus has been shown in combining two or more sources such as Facebook and Instagram [55], Facebook and Twitter Posts [56], US newspaper media and Facebook [57], and Google and Wikipedia [58].
        </p>
        <p>The use of web-based sources offers an assessment of real-time information, whether it is from Twitter, Google, or other social media and search queries. For health data retrieved through traditional methods such as registries, questionnaires, or surveys, analysis and assessment can take time to perform. Thus, nowcasting using said methods is not trivial. However, web-based (real time) data has been shown to significantly contribute to the analysis and forecasting of certain diseases, outbreaks, and epidemics. Therefore, this specific part of health informatics has benefitted from infodemiology. In particular, one of the most studied diseases is influenza, and several data sources have been employed to predict and assess flu-related topics [39,40,[59][60][61][62][63][64][65][66][67][68][69][70][71][72][73][74][75][76]. Epidemics and infectious diseases that have been analyzed and assessed using infodemiology and infoveillance approaches include HIV/AIDS [77][78][79], measles [80][81][82][83], and the Zika virus [84][85][86][87].The use of web-based sources offers an assessment of real-time information, whether it is from Twitter, Google, or other social media and search queries.

        <p>Infodemiology topics have also been the subject of research for several reviews on various topics like curable sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) [88] and mental health disorders [89], and for data sources like search queries, social media [6], mobile phone apps [90], Twitter [91], and Google Trends [92].Infodemiology topics have also been the subject of research for several reviews on various topics like curable sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) [88] and mental health disorders [89], and for data sources like search queries, social media [6], mobile phone apps [90], Twitter [91], and Google Trends [92].</p>
        <p>Infodemiology has contributed to health assessment with the analysis of a range of topics. In specific, popular categories in the field of infodemiology and infoveillance include drugs [39,93,94], marijuana [95][96][97], depression and suicide [98][99][100][101][102][103][104][105][106][107][108], smoking and tobacco [109][110][111][112][113][114][115][116], electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) [117][118][119][120][121][122][123][124][125][126], and hookahs [127][128][129][130]. As far as chronic diseases are concerned, the assessment of diabetes [131][132][133][134][135][136] and multiple sclerosis [137,138] has benefitted from infodemiology and infoveillance studies. Other topics include breast cancer [139][140][141][142]; fitness and diet [143][144][145][146]; health care performance, evaluation, and dissemination [147,148]; and human papillomavirus (HPV) [149][150][151][152][153][154].Infodemiology has contributed to health assessment with the analysis of a range of topics.

        <p>This review aims to update and expand the 2013 scoping review of Bernardo et al [6]. The authors of said review provided a well-structured outline of how infodemiology was employed in health informatics research up to that point, but as is evident, the large corpus of studies in the field have been published within the last couple of years. This update on the subject is important in identifying how infodemiology has contributed to health informatics over the past decade compared with traditional surveillance methods, the main web sources used, and the individual health categories and topics that have been explored. Apart from identifying the "metrics" of infodemiology studies (ie, numer of publications, thematic topics, journals and publishers, and data sources), this review aims to identify the advantages, disadvantages, and value and validity of infodemiology and infoveillance.This review aims to update and expand the 2013 scoping review of Bernardo et al [6].

        <p>In the JMIR Publications database, all papers from the two relevant electronic collections (e-collections) were retrieved: 225 documents from the "Infodemiology and Infoveillance" [157] e-collection in the Journal of Medical Internet Research and 185 from the "Infodemiology, Infoveillance, and Digital Disease Surveillance" [158] e-collection in JMIR Public Health and Surveillance. After removing the duplicates and 2 documents for article type eligibility, 227 documents were extracted in total. Next, 66 documents were handpicked from the JMIR publications database based on searches of data sources (ie, "Twitter," "Google Trends," and "Google Flu Trends"). After 10 documents were excluded based on article type, a total of 56 documents were handpicked from the JMIR database. Next, the term "infodemiology" was searched for in the PubMed database from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2018, in the search field "Title-Abstract." The search returned 94 documents. The term "infoveillance" was then entered for the same period and in the same field, and the search returned 51 documents. The duplicates were 39 in total, and 2 documents were excluded based on article type; a total of 104 documents were extracted from the PubMed database. The terms "infodemiology" and "infoveillance" were then independently searched for in the Scopus database in the "Article title, Abstract, Keywords" field for the full years 2009-2018. The search returned 88 and 43 documents, respectively (ie, a total of 131).

        <p>Based on the results, the use of web-based data in health informatics is significantly increasing year by year, with half of the publications from 2009 to 2018 being in the last couple of years. The JMIR Publications database is the most significant contributor in terms of the number of publications on the subject (n=282/338, 83.4%), especially given that the most significant infodemiology-oriented journal (ie, JMIR Public Health and Surveillance) is published with JMIR Publications. The concept of infodemiology, introduced by Gunther Eysenbach in 2002, has been gaining significant recognition since its birth, and it is evident that it will play an even more significant role in health informatics in the years to come, especially as internet penetration increases along with the average age of the users.Based on the results, the use of web-based data in health informatics is significantly increasing year by year, with half of the publications from 2009 to 2018 being in the last couple of years.

        <p>Despite the increasingly large number of users and the fact that Twitter is used significantly more than Google, Twitter has the limitation of not being universal. Its pros include that it is an outlet for official reports and news (eg, governmental, politicians), but a significant con is that it is not used by all; furthermore, not everyone interacts on the site (ie, tweets or retweets).

            <rs type="software">Yahoo</rs>)-is more universal in the sense that internet penetration has increased to a point where the large majority of people have access to and use the internet and searching for keywords in search engines is the most used internet feature. Apart from this, it also ensures anonymity, deeming it more reliable, as it uses the revealed and not the stated users' preferences. However, the choosing of the keywords (queries) as well as the methodology for selecting the retrieved data is much more complicated than with Twitter. In addition, more than one search engine exists, and thus, not all queries (data) on the respective selected topic can be retrieved.
        </p>
        <p>On the other hand, there is a significant rise in the percentage of publications in the last couple of years using data from other social media such as Facebook and Instagram. This could be showing that younger internet users' preferences in the use of social media may be revealing a trend of said platforms over original search queries and websites. Researchers in this field should closely follow any potential shifts in internet use, along with the correspondence and age of users, to ensure-to the point that is possible with web-based data-that the sample is representative and the research aims to change along with what is trending. The latter is crucial for infodemiology research to continue to be valid, and it should be given significant focus.On the other hand, there is a significant rise in the percentage of publications in the last couple of years using data from other social media such as Facebook and Instagram.

        <p>As is evident, there is a wide variety of topics that have been studied up to this point. The most popular topics identified in this review were illegal drugs, breast cancer, smoking, fitness, HIV/AIDS, depression, diabetes, influenza, HPV, multiple sclerosis, Zika virus, suicide, STDs, and e-cigarettes, and significant attention has been given to the evaluation of health care such as hospital ratings and patients' experiences and health topics' and medical institutions' dissemination strategies.As is evident, there is a wide variety of topics that have been studied up to this point.

        <p>Approaches include nowcasting epidemics and outbreaks, surveillance of infectious diseases, assessment of chronic conditions, and basically everything traditional surveillance methods have aimed to do. Thus, the results of this review show not only the increasing popularity of web-based data but also their significant contribution to the existing literature, as well as the value of infodemiology in health informatics.Approaches include nowcasting epidemics and outbreaks, surveillance of infectious diseases, assessment of chronic conditions, and basically everything traditional surveillance methods have aimed to do.

        <p>The difference in using web-based data-infodemiology's main advantage-is that it tackles the issue of traditional surveillance methods not providing real time assessments. Even in the health sector, where data are generally available compared to other topics, the gathering, assessing, and publishing of health data can sometimes take years to process. This is less of an issue for topics such as chronic diseases that are not infectious, but it makes the assessment and forecasting of epidemics and outbreaks much more complicated.The difference in using web-based data-infodemiology's main advantage-is that it tackles the issue of traditional surveillance methods not providing real time assessments.

        <p>Another significant advantage of infoveillance compared to traditional surveillance methods is the anonymity that web-based data offers. Online search traffic data are completely anonymous, and in most social media and forums, an individual has the option of anonymity. In this way, data retrieved from said sources are the revealed and not the stated preferences, which can be a plus for sensitive topics such as AIDS or STDs.Another significant advantage of infoveillance compared to traditional surveillance methods is the anonymity that web-based data offers.

        <p>Despite the many advantages that web-based data sources have to offer, several limitations have been identified in the use of infodemiology sources. The main disadvantage of using web-based sources is that the data can be affected by sudden incidents or events, which, especially in nowcasting or when the number of observations is low, could provide biased results. Similarly, the sample cannot be shown to be representative, especially in the assessment of online search traffic data; although, this is less of an issue as internet penetration increases.Despite the many advantages that web-based data sources have to offer, several limitations have been identified in the use of infodemiology sources.

        <p>With real time data that can be retrieved from web sources, disease surveillance has become much faster than with traditional methods, and web sources also have the benefit of assessing large populations, which contrasts with most traditional methods that are based on data retrieved from significantly smaller groups, such as with interviews or questionnaires. Overall, what health informatics should aim toward in the future is to combine web-data sources with traditional data assessment to provide an even more complete assessment.With real time data that can be retrieved from web sources, disease surveillance has become much faster than with traditional methods, and web sources also have the benefit of assessing large populations, which contrasts with most traditional methods that are based on data retrieved from significantly smaller groups, such as with interviews or questionnaires.

        <p>The main limitation of this scoping review was that not all infodemiology papers could be included. Though the selection of publications for this work was thorough and followed the guidelines for proper selection and included the main outlets for infodemiology papers (ie, JMIR Publications and PubMed), some publications may have been left out; a limitation that all reviews have. Specifically, articles using the two most popular infodemiology sources (ie, Twitter and Google) were only searched for in the JMIR database. Studies using, for example, Google Trends and Twitter constitute a large body of the relevant literature, and a significant number of said studies were not included as they did not use the specific searched for terms (ie, infodemiology and infoveillance); the latter being the main difference from the original Bernardo et al [6] scoping review. However, despite the possible reduced number of included publications that use infodemiology and infoveillance sources but not the infodemiology or infoveillance terms, as JMIR is the main outlet for such themed publications, this scoping review gives a valuable qualitative and quantitative overview of how the concept has progressed over the last decade, as well as identifying the main sources and topics that have been used and assessed. Future work should focus on expanding the present results, as well as recording infodemiology papers based on tools used. As the search by source yields many results, focus should be given to future systematic reviews on the subject by source as has been done, for example, for the use of Google Trends [92].The main limitation of this scoping review was that not all infodemiology papers could be included.

        <p>Using web-based sources in epidemiology and disease surveillance has shown to be valuable and valid over the past decade, and the results of this scoping review clearly point to this direction. Data sources cover a wide variety of tools, social media, platforms, websites, blogs, and search engines, and the topics that are the most studied vary from chronic disease prevalence to nowcasting epidemics. Infodemiology and infoveillance tackle several of the issues that arise with traditional assessment methods, and, as internet penetration increases, employing web data sources for health assessment could be the future in health informatics.Using web-based sources in epidemiology and disease surveillance has shown to be valuable and valid over the past decade, and the results of this scoping review clearly point to this direction.
