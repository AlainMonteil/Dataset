        <p>In the last decade, a combination of novel computational approaches, increases in available computing capacity, and availability of training data, have facilitated the application of powerful mathematical algorithms in the field of artificial intelligence. This has led to dramatic advances in the performance of computers in tasks that have previously only been possible for humans. Methods that are able to make predictions of data without direct human intervention in the training process are referred to as machine learning. Image classification has been at the forefront of machine learning research, and as visual pattern recognition plays a larger role in dermatology than perhaps any other medical specialities, early clinical applications of machine learning have been within this speciality.</p>
        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is difficult to define precisely. In Alan Turing's seminal paper 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence', he proposes the well known Turing test, whereby a machine is deemed intelligent if it's indistinguishable from a human in conversation by an impartial observer. 1 In modern parlance, Artificial General Intelligence refers to the ability of a machine to communicate, reason and operate independently in both familiar and novel scenarios in a similar manner to a human. This remains far beyond the scope of current methods and is not what is being referred to when the term 'AI' is commonly used. Most references to AI now are often as an interchangeable term to 'machine learning' or 'deep learning', the latter being a specific form of machine learning that is discussed in more detail below (see Table 1 for a glossary of terms). Machine learning refers to algorithms and statistical models that learn from labelled training data from which they are able to recognise and infer patterns (Figure 1A). Table 1: essential terminology in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence Artificial Intelligence (AI)</p>
        <p>The ability of machines, such as computers, to simulate human intelligence Machine learning Algorithms and statistical models that are programmed to learn from data, therefore recognising and inferring patterns within it. This enables computers to perform specific tasks without explicit instructions from a human operator.</p>
        <p>Refers to machine learning tasks whereby the goal is to identify a function that best maps a set of inputs (e.g. image) to their correct output (label). This is based learning or training on pre-matched pairs. This is in contrast to unsupervised learning, where novel patterns such as groups or 'clusters' are identified in data without influence from prior knowledge or labelling.</p>
        <p>A common problem in machine learning where the model has high accuracy when tested on data from the same source as its training data, but its performance doesn't generalise to novel sources of data.</p>
        <p>Neural network A form of supervised machine learning inspired by biology whereby data passes through a series of interconnected neurons, which are individually weighted to make predictions. During training, the data passes through the network in an iterative manner and the weightings are continually adjusted to optimise its ability to match label to data.</p>
        <p>Refers to a neural network with multiple layers of 'neurons' that have adjustable weights (mathematical functions).</p>
        <p>Refers to a type of neural network whereby the layers apply filters for specific features to areas within an image Generally, during the training of a machine learning model a subset of the data is 'held back' and then subsequently used for testing the accuracy of the trained model. The accuracy of the model is assessed on this test dataset according to its accuracy in correctly matching an image to its label, for example melanoma or benign naevus. In any classification system there will be a trade off between sensitivity and specificity; for example an AI system may output a probability score for melanoma between 0 and 1 and this would require the operator to set a threshold for the decision boundary. At a low threshold, a higher proportion of melanomas will be captured (high sensitivity) but there is a risk of classifying benign naevi as malignant (low specificity). As the threshold is increased, this would decrease the sensitivity, but increase the specificity (i.e. fewer benign naevi classified as melanoma). The behaviour of a machine learning classifier in response to changing the threshold can be visualized as a receiver operating curve (ROC). The greater the area under the curve (AUROC), the more accurate the classifier (Figure 1B).</p>
        <p>Figure 1: A) Schematic depicting how a machine learning algorithm trains on a large dataset to be able to match data to label (supervised learning), the performance of which can then be assessed. B) Schematic of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve, which is a way of visualising the performance of a trained model's sensitivity and specificity. Typically, machine learning studies will use ROC curves and calculations of the Area Under the Curve (AUC or AUROC) to quantify accuracy. The dashed line represents the desired perfect performance, when sensitivity and specificity are both 100%; in this scenario, the AUC would be 1.0. In reality, there is a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, which gives rise to a curve. C) Schematic depicting how classification tasks are performed in convolutional neural networks. Pixel data from an image is passed through an architecture consisting of multiple layers of connecting nodes. In convolutional neural networks, these layers contain unique 'convolutional layers', which operate as filters. These filters work because it was recognised that the location of a feature within an image is often less important than whether that feature is present or absentan example might be (theoretically) the presence or absence of blue-grey veiling within a melanoma. A convolutional 'filter' learns a particular feature of the image irrespective of where it occurs within the image (represented by the black squares). The network is composed of a large number of hierarchical filters that learn increasingly high level representations of the image. These could in principle learn dermoscopic features similar to those described by clinicians, although in practice the precise features recognised are likely to differ from classic diagnostic criteria.</p>
        <p>Neural networks (Figure 1C) pass input data through a series of interconnected nodes (analogous to biological neurons). Each node functions as a mathematical operation (addition, multiplication etc) and a group of interconnected nodes within the network is referred to as a 'layer' within a network, with the overall structure of the layers being referred to as the 'architecture'. During training, every node is adjusted and optimised through an iterative process called backpropagation 2,3 , allowing the neural network to improve its classification accuracy.</p>
        <p>Neural networks with multiple 'hidden layers' of nodes (Figure 1C) are referred to as 'deep' neural nets and perform 'deep learning'. Although the concept of deep neural networks was described decades ago, lack of affordable and efficient computing power was a major limitation in being able to train them effectively. However, in 2013 it was recognised that graphical processing units (GPUs), originally designed for 3-dimensional graphics in computer games, could be repurposed to power the repetitive training required for neural networks 4,5 . Of note, convolutional neural networks are a specific form of deep learning architecture that have proven effective for the classification of image data. Convolutional neural networks have massively increased in popularity as a method for computer-based image classification after the victory of the GPU-powered CNN AlexNet in 2012, which won the ImageNet competition with a top 5 error rate of 15.3%, which was a remarkable 10% improvement on the next best competitor 5 .</p>
        <p>In the past few years, use of convolutional neural networks in classification tasks has exploded due to demonstrable and consistently superior efficacy, as well as availability. Novel CNN architectures have been developed, improved and made available for public use by institutions with a high level of expertise and computational resources; examples of these include 'Inception' by Google, and 'ResNet' by Microsoft. These architectures can be accessed using software such as 
            <rs type="software">TensorFlow</rs> (developed by 
            <rs type="creator">Google</rs>) or 
            <rs type="software">PyTorch</rs> (developed by 
            <rs type="creator">Facebook</rs>) and then trained further for a specific purpose or used in a novel application. A common approach would be to take a pre-trained image recognition network architecture such as 'Inception' by Google, and specialise its application by inputting a specific type of image data. This process is referred to as transfer learning.
        </p>
        <p>Classifying data using CNNs is now relatively accessible, computationally efficient, and inexpensive; hence the explosion in so-called 'artificial intelligence'. In medicine, to date the main areas of application have been the visual diagnostic specialties of dermatology, radiology and pathology. Automating aspects of dermatology with computer-aided image classification has been attempted in dermatology for over 30 years [6][7][8] ; however previous efforts have achieved only limited accuracy. Although attempts have been made in recent years to use neural networks to diagnose or monitor inflammatory dermatoses 9,10,11 , these have generally not been as successful or impressive as the networks constructed to diagnose skin lesions, particularly melanoma. Melanoma is therefore the focus of the remainder of this review, and supplementary figure 1 summarises these head-to-head comparison studies [12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21] .</p>
        <p>In 2017, Esteva et al published a landmark study in Nature which was notable for being the first to compare a neural network's performance against dermatologists. 14 They used a pre-trained 
            <rs type="software">GoogLeNet</rs> Inception v3 architecture and fine-tuned the network (transfer learning) using a dataset of 127,463 clinical and dermoscopic images of skin lesions (subsequent studies have shown it is possible to train networks on significantly smaller datasets, numbering in the thousands). For testing, they selected a subset of clinical and dermoscopic images confirmed with biopsy and asked over 20 dermatologists for their treatment decisions. Dermatologists were presented with 265 clinical images and 111 dermoscopic images of 'keratinocytic' or 'melanocytic' nature, and asked whether they would advise (a) biopsy/further treatment or (b) reassure the patient. They inferred a 'malignant' or 'benign' diagnosis from these management decisions, and then plotted the dermatologists' performance on the network's ROC curves with regards to classifying the keratinocytic or melanocytic lesions (which were subdivided as dermoscopic or clinical) as 'benign' or 'malignant' (Figure 2A). In both 'keratinocytic' and 'melanocytic' categories, the average dermatologist performed at a level below the CNN ROC curves, with only one individual dermatologist performing better than the CNN ROC in each category. This suggests that in the context of this study, the CNN has superior accuracy to dermatologists.
        </p>
        <p>A recently published large study detailed in two papers by Brinker et al. 19,20 involved training a 'ResNet' model on the publically available International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) database 22 , which contains in excess of 20,000 labelled dermoscopic images, which is required to meet some basic quality standards. This network was trained on over 12,000 images to perform two tasks: the first was to classify dermoscopic images of melanocytic lesions as benign or malignant (Figure 2B), and the second was to classify clinical images of melanocytic lesions as benign or malignant (Figure 2C). The dermatologists were assessed using 200 test images, with the decision requested mirroring that of the Esteva study: to biopsy/treat or to reassure. Additionally, the dermatologists demographic data, such as experience and training level, were requested. The method used to quantify the relative performance also consisted of drawing a mean ROC curve by calculating the average predicted class probability for each test image (Figure 2B-C). The dermatologists' performance for the same set of images was then plotted on the ROC curve. Barring a few individual exceptions, the dermatologists' performance fell below the CNN ROC curves in both the clinical and dermoscopic image classifications. The authors also used a second approach, whereby they set the sensitivity of the CNN at the level of the attending dermatologists, and compared the mean specificity achieved at equivalent sensitivity. In the dermoscopic test, at a sensitivity of 74.1%, the dermatologists' specificity was 60% whereas the CNN achieved a superior 86.5%.</p>
        <p>As part of an international effort to produce technology for early melanoma diagnosis, in 2016 an annual challenge was established to test the performance of machine learning algorithms using the image database from the ISIC. 22 A recent paper by Tschandl et al 21 summarises the performance of the most recent competition in August-September 2018, and also compares the performance of the submitted algorithms against 511 human readers recruited from the World Dermoscopy Congress who comprised a mixture of board-certified dermatologists, dermatology residents and general practitioners (Figure 2D). Test batches of 30 images were generated to compare the groups, with a choice of 7 diagnoses as multiple choice questions (MCQs) provided. When comparing all 139 algorithms to all dermatologists, dermatologists on average achieved 17/30 on the image MCQs, whereas the algorithms on average achieved 19. As expected, years of experience improved the probability for making a correct diagnosis. Regardless, the top 3 algorithms in the challenge outperformed even experts with &gt;10 years experience and the ROC curves of these top 3 algorithms sit well above the average performance of the human readers.</p>
        <p>Figure 2: Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves from studies by Esteva, Brinker and Tschandl. Most often, the dermatologists' comparative ROCs are plotted as individual data points; lying below the curve means that their sensitivity and specificity and therefore accuracy, is considered inferior to the model in the study. The studies all demonstrate that on average, dermatologists sit below the ROC curve of the machine learning algorithm. It is noticeable that the performance of the clinicians in Brinker's studies (B-C), for example, is inferior to clinicians in the Esteva study(A). Although there is a greater spread of clinical experience in the Brinker study, you could also hypothesise the discrepancy may be related to methods how the clinicians were tested. In both Brinker and Tschandl's studies, some individual data points represent performance discrepancy that is significantly lower than data would suggest in the real world, which could suggest that the assessments may be biased against clinicians.</p>
        <p>Given that, remarkably, all of the published studies indicate superiority of machine learning algorithms to dermatologists, it is worth exploring the biases commonly found in these study designs. These can be categorised into biases which favour the networks and biases which disadvantage clinicians. With regards to the first category, it is first worth noting that in the studies described, the neural networks are generally trained and tested on the same dataset. This closed-loop system of training and testing highlights a common limitation within machine learning called 'generalisability'. On the occasions that generalisability has been tested, neural networks have often been found lacking. For example, Han et al released their neural network, which was a Microsoft ResNet-152 architecture trained on nearly 20,000 skin lesion images from a variety of sources as a web application 15 . When Navarette-Dechent et al. tested the network on data from the ISIC dataset, which the network had not previously been exposed to, its performance dropped from a reported AUC of 0.91, to achieving the correct diagnosis in only 29 out of 100 lesions, which would imply a far lower AUC 23 . As algorithms are fundamentally a reflection of their training data, this means that if the input image dataset is biased in some way, this will have a direct impact on algorithmic performance, which will only be apparent when they are tested on completely separate datasets,.</p>
        <p>Another important limitation of the methodology used to compare AI models with dermatologists is that ROC curves, although a useful visual representation of sensitivity and specificity, do not address other important clinical risks. For example, in order to capture more melanomas (increased sensitivity), the algorithm may incorrectly misclassify more benign naevi as malignant (false positives). However, this could potentially lead to unnecessary biopsies for patients, which asides from patient harm, would create additional demand on an already burdened healthcare system. There is evidence that dermatologists have improved 'number need to biopsy' (NNB) metrics for melanoma in comparison to non-dermatologists. 24 . The reporting of NNB would be a useful addition to studies such as Esteva's, as it would aid in the estimation of potential patient and health economic impact.</p>
        <p>It is also worth noting that these datasets are retrospectively collated and repurposed for image classification training; this means that the images captured may not be representative in terms of proportion of diagnoses, or in terms of having typical features. As neural networks are essentially a reflection of their labelled data input, this will undoubtedly have consequences on how they perform. However, given the lack of 'real-world' studies, it is difficult to know how significant this is. When it comes to assessing clinicians using images from these datasets, this may also introduce an element of bias that disadvantages clinicians too, as lesions that were deemed worthy of capturing via photograph or being biopsied may not be representative of the lesion type, resulting in the sensitivity of clinicians diagnostically may be lower than in a normal clinic. This hypothesis for discrepancy in diagnostic accuracy is borne out in a recent Cochrane review, where the diagnostic sensitivity of dermatologists examining melanocytic lesions with dermoscopy is 92% 25 , which is significantly higher than typically found in neural network studies. For example in Tschandl's web-based study of 511 clinicians, the sensitivity of experts was 81.2%. The manner in which clinical decisions are inferred as 'benign' or 'malignant' also makes some assumptions that may not be accurate; for example, a dermatologist's decision to biopsy a lesion is a reflection of risk, not an outright 'malignant' classification.</p>
        <p>From a safety perspective, there are two considerations that have yet to be addressed thus far in studies. Firstly, in order to 'replace' a dermatologist, an algorithm must be able to match the current gold standard for screening a patient's skin lesions. Currently, this is a clinical assessment by a dermatologist, who examines the lesion in the context of patient history and the rest of their skin. Published studies do not compare neural networks to this standard of assessment; they are only compared to dermatologists presented with dermoscopic or clinical images, sometimes with limited additional clinical information. This not only biases the studies against dermatologists, who are not trained or accustomed to make diagnoses without this information, it also represents a limiting factor in justifying their deployment in a clinical setting as a replacement for dermatologists. Fundamentally, it has not yet been demonstrated that they are equivalent to the standard of dermatological care currently provided to patients. A second important consideration is the fact that training data lack sufficient quantities of certain types of lesions, particularly the rarer presentations of malignancy, such as amelanotic melanoma. 15 It is not yet clear how algorithms perform when presented with entirely novel, potentially malignant, lesions; this has rare but significant safety implications for patients.</p>
        <p>From a legal perspective, an issue that has yet to be fully addressed is the lack of explainability by neural networks. Currently, it is not possible to know what contributes to their decisionmaking process. This has led to criticisms and concerns that neural networks function as 'black boxes' with potential unanticipated and hard to explain failure modes. The European Union's General Data Protection Requirement (GDPR) specifies explainability as a requirement for algorithmic decision-making, which is currently not achievable 26,27 . Algorithmic decision-making also has uncertain status in the USA; where the Food and Drug Administration have advised that until there exists a body of evidence from clinical trials, clinical decisions suggested by AI ought to be considered AI-guided, not AI-provided, and liability would still rest with the clinician 28 .</p>
        <p>There are attempts to deploy 'AI' technologies within the healthcare space within two main scenarios: direct to consumer/public and as a decision aid for clinicians.The direct to consumer model already exists in some fashion; there are smartphone apps such as 
            <rs type="software">SkinVision</rs>, which enable individuals to assess and track their skin lesions. However, currently such apps do not make accountable diagnoses and usually explicitly state in their terms and conditions that they do not provide a diagnostic service nor do they intend to replace or substitute visits to healthcare providers. At present, it is not clear yet what the benefits and risks of such a tool are in terms of how frequently it provides false reassurance, and how frequently it recommends referral when this is not needed. Although health data democratisation has benefits from the perspective of patient autonomy, it may be that this does not translate to better health outcomes and might instead lead to unnecessary concern and investigations. Moreover, fundamentally, healthcare is currently structured in such a way that responsibility and liability are carried by the provider and not the patient, and as such these apps do not have a clear-cut position in healthcare infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>The current social and legal framework of healthcare is better primed for incorporating AI as a decision aid for clinicians, particularly in enhancing decision-making by non-specialists (Figure 3). This could potentially be of great use in dermatology services due to the ever-growing burden of skin cancer. In the UK, there is a longstanding shortfall of consultant dermatologists, and current workforce planning is insufficient to address this. The volume of skin cancers has a knock-on effect on patients with chronic inflammatory skin diseases, essentially reducing their access to dermatologists. Dermatologists are also aware that generally, a high proportion of referrals to dermatology with suspected skin cancer on the urgent 'two-week wait' pathway do not require further investigation and are actually immediately discharged. Many of the lesions falling into this category are easily recognised by dermatologists, but are not easily recognised by non-specialists. One could hypothesise that CNN-based applications can aid a GP service to triage skin lesions more effectively, and ensure that patients are managed by the appropriate clinical services. Having a clinical user also mitigates many of the risks and limitations inherent to CNN-based technologies, improving both safety profile and patient experience. The recently published Topol Review on 'Preparing the healthcare workforce to deliver the digital future' states that 'to reap the benefits, the NHS must focus on building a digitally ready workforce that is fully engaged and has the skills and confidence to adopt and adapt new technologies in practice and in context'. It also concludes that the 'adoption of technology should be used to give healthcare staff more time to care and interact directly with patients'. 29 In the context of dermatology, this very much holds true. Technology adoption could improve clinical pathways, and enable our neediest patients to access dermatology services more efficiently. It is unlikely that they will threaten our profession; in reality they represent an opportunity for personal learning, service improvement and leadership that could be transformative for our future healthcare system.</p>
