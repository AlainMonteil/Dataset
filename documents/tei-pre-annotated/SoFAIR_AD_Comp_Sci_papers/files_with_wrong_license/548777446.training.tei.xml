        <p>Recently, building an accurate mathematical model with the help of the experimentally measured data of solar cells and Photovoltaic (PV) modules, as a tool for simulation and performance evaluation of the PV systems, has attracted the attention of many researchers. In this work, Coyote Optimization Algorithm (COA) has been applied for extracting the unknown parameters involved in various models for the solar cell and PV modules, namely single diode model, double diode model, and three diode model. The choice of COA algorithm for such an application is made because of its good tracking characteristics and the balance creation between the exploration and exploitation phases. Additionally, it has only two control parameters and such a feature makes it very simple in application. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value between the data based on the optimized parameters for each model and those based on the measured data of the solar cell and PV modules is adopted as the objective function. Parameters' estimation for various types of PV modules (mono-crystalline, thin-film, and multi-crystalline) under different operating scenarios such as a change in intensity of solar radiation and cell temperature is studied. Furthermore, a comprehensive statistical study has been performed to validate the accurateness and stability of the applied COA as a competitor to other optimization algorithms in the optimal design of PV module parameters. Simulation results, as well as the statistical measurement, validate the superiority and the reliability of the COA algorithm not only for parameter extraction of different PV modules but also under different operating scenarios. With the COA, precise PV models have been established with acceptable RMSE of 7.7547×10 -4 , 7.64801×10 -4 , and 7.59756 × 10 -4 for SDM, DDM, and TDM respectively considering R.T.C. France solar cell.</p>

        <p>Due to the availability of solar energy (SE) at a very high rate, the exploration and investigation of the solar energy systems are extensively performed to achieve the best exploitation of this kind of renewable energy sources [1]. As the SE The associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and approving it for publication was Diego Oliva . is a clean source, so it contributes effectively in reducing the pollution rates around the earth, besides that it helps to reduce the burdens on the traditional nonrenewable energy systems used for generating the electricity such as steam power stations and hydroelectric power stations [2], [3]. Based on this, plenty of research studies have been carried out for solving the problems appeared as a result of the increased progress in the field of SE [2]. The majority of the presented studies have concerned with analyzing the performance of the photovoltaic (PV) modules which are consisting of groups of solar cells (SC) [4]. By the end of the last decade, the demand for the PV modules witnessed a remarkable rising, and at the same time, their prices reduced noticeably.</p>
        <p>Despite the fact that the PV has brought great benefits to the grid/micro-grid [5]- [7] and the electricity markets, it suffered from a remarkable challenge related to the operating efficiency which varies according to the weather conditions under which the SC works [8], [9]. This is in addition to its high maintenance cost as reported in Ref. [10], [11]. According to these shortages; robust designing techniques have to be developed to realize the optimal operation of the PV modules and solar cells under different operating conditions. The design procedure for the SC is mainly depending on the equivalent mathematical model of the SC itself. The importance of the SC model is obvious through its ability to stimulate all variables, which manage the dynamic behavior of the real SC. Moreover, through analyzing the behavior using the mathematical model, the current-voltage (I-V) curve can be easily obtained, which contributes effectively in understanding the behavior of SC and PV systems under different weather conditions.</p>
        <p>The main two models, which have been used for modelling the SC are the Single-Diode (SD) model and Double-Diode (DD) model. The two models are consisting of electronic elements, which form a circuit that can analyze and incorporate the nonlinearities of the real SC. Both the SD and DD models include a set of components, which are the diodesaturation current, the photo-generated current, the series resistance, and the ideality factor pertinent to the diode. For the SD model, five parameters are utilized to represent the SC operation. Meanwhile, for the DD model, it employs about seven parameters. The key point about deriving an efficient mathematical model depends entirely on the estimation of these parameters, and thus the parameters have to be properly and precisely extracted to achieve a correct balance between the current (I) and voltage (V) for the SC and PV modules as well.</p>
        <p>Despite the ability of these modules (SD and DD) to provide better analysis of the SC or PV systems, their utilization had been restricted to the domestic use, which means that their dynamic performance had been tested for a limited number of operating conditions. To overcome this shortage, the Three-Diode (TD) model has been presented [12]. The TD model incorporates nine parameters in order to model and stimulate the behavior of the SC and PV modules. Utilizing the nine parameters of the TD model has enabled the modeling of the real industrial applications of the SC and PV modules with high accuracy and improved efficiency. In general, using the diode models require the configuration of parameters set to achieve the desired performance, and this is considered as a challenge. However, this issue can be treated and formulated in the form of an optimization problem.</p>
        <p>Plenty of numerical methodologies are applied to explore the finest model parameters, which achieve the best performance of the PV systems. In [13], a nonlinear least-squares algorithm with the utilization of the Newton model has been implemented to estimate the SC unknown parameters.</p>
        <p>Analytical methods and techniques have been applied for introducing I-V characteristics using a co-content function as stated in [14]. In [15], three analytical algorithms have been introduced and compared with each other for extracting the SC parameters depending on the SD model; the conclusion stated that the curve-fitting technique had the best result. In [16], A proposed RMSE expression based on Lambert W function has been proposed as an exact solution for RMSE of 5-parameter single diode PV models. However, in [16], there is no exact analytical solution based on Lambert W function has been reached for DDM or TDM yet because of the high nonlinearity of the current expressions of these models [16]. Lambert W-function was reported in [17], which has been utilized to extract the parameters of the DD model. In [18], Tabular techniques have been adopted for the PV systems with accurate results; however, the computational burden was high. In [19], a detailed comparison between the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and the Newton-Raphson technique has been presented for estimating the parameters of PV modules. These types of optimization techniques were called deterministic techniques, which can consider several boundary conditions such as convexity and differentiability to ensure proper implementation. Unfortunately, this action resulted in introducing local optima due to the dependency of the outputs on the primary solutions. The last fact can be investigated in [20], where the Newton-Raphson technique was used to extract the unknown parameters of the DD model. The results introduced a remarkable deviation between the real and estimated values of voltage and current [21], [22]. This is in addition to the high computational burdens of these methodologies.</p>
        <p>In the last decade, the evolutionary computation algorithms have been presented and implemented for extracting the model parameters of PV modules and SC. Such algorithms possess various advantages such as they do not need anticipated information about the search space, and they have the ability to carry out a multidimensional exploration in the search spaces using different arrangements until the best solution has appeared [23]. Based on the merits of evolutionary computation algorithms, various approaches have been proposed. In [24], the genetic algorithms (GA) have been utilized to enhance the accuracy of parameters estimation for the DD model of the PV modules and SC. In [25], the particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been adopted to evaluate the parameters of solar cells using both the SD and DD models. An efficient technique has been proposed in [26]. This algorithm is called the Simulated Annealing (SA) method, which has been utilized to determine the parameters of the SD and DD model of SC and PV modules. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the meta-heuristic (MH) optimization techniques allow building an effective PV modulator according to various criteria such as precision, consistency, convergence speed, calculation efficiency and the reduced number of control parameters [23], [27]- [36]. These algorithms can be classified into four categories, evolutionary algorithms (Genetic Algorithm (GA), differential Evolution (DE), and Confidence-Weighted (SCW), physics-based algorithms (Wind Driven Optimization (WDO), Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA), and Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA)), swarm-based algorithms (Artificial bee colony (ABC), particle swarm optimization (PSO), Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), and human-based algorithms (HBA). The following points can be concluded from the introduced review: The influence on the performance of these techniques by noise and change in irradiation and temperature should be taken into account. To find the optimal solution, it is suggested to evaluate the impact of various objective functions on the performance of the MH methods: the error of calculation and estimating energy, the root mean square error, relative mistakes, etc.</p>
        <p>To improve the performance of the MH, it is advisable to make combinations between the MH methods and other alternative methods. These combinations include; the chaotic maps methods, opposite learning method, quantum methods, and the hybridization of different MH methods. For example, this helps the MH methods to discover the search area and improve their robustness, behavior, and time complexity; study the impact of the metaheuristic method control parameters on their operation and effectiveness. As most parameters are random, selecting the optimal value will improve the shape of the convergence behavior and prevent the local point from being stuck. The new methods of metaheuristic proposed for extracting the ideal PV cell parameters should reduce their time complexity. Further experiments with different MH methods are required in the three-diode model.</p>
        <p>From the abovementioned review, it can be realized that the studies in the literature with regards to parameters' estimation accuracy for the SC and PV modules have been limited to the SD and DD models and they were rarely treated with the TD model, and for this purpose, the current paper introduces a comprehensive study about the estimation of the design parameters of SD, DD and TD models for the SC and PV modules using different optimization algorithms. From this context, Coyote Optimization Algorithm (COA) [37] is applied in this paper to address the problem of optimal estimation of the unknown parameters for different models of SCs and PV modules.</p>
        <p>The paper is organized as follows; Section II introduces and analyzes the different diode models for the SC and PV modules. Moreover, section II illustrates the methodology of applying the optimization algorithm to estimate the model parameters of SC. In section III, the proposed optimization technique is introduced and explained. The tests are carried out and discussed in section IV. Finally, the conclusions and outcomes are discussed in section V.</p>
        <p>In order to design the SC and PV modules, a mathematical model has to be used to extract the SC parameters analytically. Based upon this, electronic circuits consisting of diodes are used to model the SC. The SD and DD models are the most items used for evaluating the parameters of the SC and PV modules, this is in addition to the TD circuit which is introduced recently [12].</p>
        <p>As shown in Fig. 1, the model has only one diode used for parallelizing the current source I ph that presents the photogenerated current. The diode acts as a half-wave rectifier. The model considers also the non-physical ideality factor of the diode [26]. The model has a very simple form, and thus it is easy to be implemented. The main issue with this simple model is that it contains only five unknown parameters, which have to be precisely determined. In Fig. 1, the SC current I t can be identified from the following expression;</p>
        <p>where I t , I ph , I sd and I sh refer to the output, photo-generated, diode, and parallel resistance currents, respectively. It is possible to use the equivalent diode equation developed by Shockley in order to develop a more precise model for the internal parameters of the diode. Thus, (1) can be reformulated by,</p>
        <p>where V t is the output cell voltage and I sd is the diode saturation current. R s is the series resistance and R sh represents the shunt resistance; while n refers to the non-physical ideality factor. Moreover, q refers to the charge magnitude on an electron, and q = 1.602 × 10 -19 Coulombs (C). k is the Boltzmann constant and k = 1.380 × 10 -23 (J /K ).</p>
        <p>T is the solar cell temperature in Kelvin (K ). Thus, the proper operation of the model can be achieved through the accurate estimation of these parameters, which will be performed using different optimization algorithms in the next sections.</p>
        <p>The SD model is not usually a suitable selection for different applications [36]; and for this reason, the double diode (DD) model is proposed as presented in Fig. 2. From Fig. 2, it can be noticed that there are two diodes; the first is acting as a rectifier while the other is used to take into consideration the effect of current results from the recombination and the impact non-idealities of the SC [36]. The current balance in the equivalent circuit of Fig. 2 can be represented by:</p>
        <p>where I d1 , I d2 represent the first and second diode currents, respectively. The Shockley equivalence is utilized in order to update the internal arrangement of the two diodes. Accordingly, Eq. ( 3) can be reformulated as follows,</p>
        <p>where I sd1 , I sd2 are the diffusion and saturation currents for each diode (D 1 and D2). n 1 and n 2 are the diffusion and re-combination ideality factors of the diodes. The rest of the parameters in (4) are previously presented and defined by (2), and thus the DD model will have seven unknown parameters that need to be estimated R s , R sh , I ph , I sd1 , I sd2 , n 1 and n 2 .</p>
        <p>An accurate model for SC and PV modules is essential for energy system analysis. The three diodes (TD) model is more appropriate for industrial applications [38]. The variable values of n 1 and n 2 illustrate that the DD model is not enough to represent the different current components of SC. The impact of gain boundaries and current losses due to leakage in the circuit have been considered with the TD model. Hence, the equivalent circuit of the TD model after the parallel connection of the third diode is shown in Fig. 3.</p>
        <p>For the first diode, the current diode I d1 is represented by recombination and diffusion processes in the near-neutral region with a volume of n 1 = 1 and the second diode with a new diode, I d2 , as the space area is replicated to n 2 = 2. Due to the recombination that has occurred inside the defect areas, the objective of the addition of a third diode along with both diodes is to consider the contribution of the current diode element I d3 . The performance current will be based on the KCL for the previous estimate.</p>
        <p>So,</p>
        <p>where, I d1 is the current of diffusion, and I d2 is the current of recombination. The current recombination contributes to I d3 in the region of a defect while n 1 , n 2 and n 3 are non-physical ideality factors. So, the TD model will have nine parameters that need to be extracted (R s , R sh , I ph , I sd1 , I sd2 , I sd3 , n 1 , n 2 and n 3 ).</p>
        <p>Through using the mathematical model of the SD, DD and TD, it is possible to address each of them as an optimization problem and its solution is the optimal values of the unknown model parameters. At first, a cost function has to be used to check if the estimated parameters are matching their actual values or not. The validity of the estimation procedure can be also investigated through checking the matching degree between the I-V characteristics given in the datasheet of a real solar cell and that estimated based on the optimized parameters of the mathematical empirical model solved based on Newton-Raphson method. Then, for the SD, the objective function can be represented by [39], [40] as follows, While, for the DD model, the error function is represented by,</p>
        <p>Whereas, for the TD model, the error function can be represented by, The values of V t and I t are measured values from a real solar cell. In (7), x = R s , R sh , I ph , I sd , n is the solution vector. The solution vector in the case of the DD model is</p>
        <p>The functions f SD , f DD and f TD ) check and measure the similarity rate of the outputs from each circuit regarding the experimentally measured ones. Then, the cost function is formulated on the base of finding the parameters that result in the minimum error between the actual I t (obtained from measurements) and the estimated I t (obtained by the diode models). A set of N E samples is necessary to be used in order to widen the search until the global optima appears, and then the cost function can be defined by,</p>
        <p>where the abbreviation RMSE denotes the root mean square error and M helps in identifying which diode model is to be utilized. COA technique will be used for identifying the optimal values of the unknown parameters of different solar cells and PV modules, which result in the minimum value of the objective function.</p>
        <p>Pseudo-code for calculating the RMSE using Newton-Raphson method may be written as the following: % calculating the RMSE using Newton-Raphson; Input k = 1.3806503E-23; q = 1.60217653E-19; T= 273.15+33; V_t = k * T/q; Read TOLER; tolerance to stop iterating Input the measured voltage vector Input the measured current vector Initialize estimated current to zero Read model parameters I_ph; I_sd; R_s; R_sh; n from the COA optimizer for J = 1 to size of measured voltage vector iniEal guess (I0(J)) while (f&gt;TOLER -tolerance to stop iterating) f (J) = f(I,J) f1(J) = f'(I,J) I1(J) = I (J)-f(J)/f1(J) I(J) = I1(J) end while end for calculate of RMSE between measured currents and estimated currents print the RMSE, estimated currents plot (measured voltage, estimated currents)</p>
        <p>Coyotes are Canis Latrans species, particularly in North America. The coyote optimization algorithm (COA) is considered as a population-based algorithm that mimics the way that coyotes follow in an adaptation to the surrounding environment and social behaviors. In its operation. COA makes combinations between the swarm intelligence and evolutionary heuristic. For optimization processes, COA provides equilibrium between discovery and development. The COA differs from the gray wolf optimization algorithm [37], [41]. The GWO describes the entire attacking cycle of the prey while the COA represents the social structure and shared understanding between the coyotes [37]. The population in this algorithm is divided into N P groups, with N c coyotes in each group. The coyote solution is a candidate and fitness costs are their social behavior. The social behavior of the c-th coyote in p-th group at a time t is presented by a vector of development variables [37].</p>
        <p>The value of the fitness feature is taken into account when adapting a coyote with its environment. The coyotes or agents are pseudo-random within the search area during the COA start process, and the following are formulated:</p>
        <p>where LB j is the lower limit of the variable j, UB j denotes the upper limit of the design variable j, and r j is an arbitrary number ranges between [0, 1]. Therefore, the fitness value of each coyote is calculated according to the following expression: The Coyotes participate randomly in groups at the beginning of the COA but sometimes they switch from group to group. This coyote departure is linked to a probability PL, which is formulated as follows:</p>
        <p>The suggested mechanism helps to change the culture of coyotes between the groups. In each group, the leader of the coyotes called the Alpha coyote is known as the most environmentally responsible coyote. The mathematical identification of the alpha coyote can be described as follows:</p>
        <p>The COA believes that coyotes are arranged in groups to share the social behavior and to share in the maintenance of the system due to the obvious signs of swarm-intelligence in this species. The COA, therefore, ties all coyote data and estimates it as a cultural trend in the pack.</p>
        <p>where O p,t is the listed social conditions of the group p coyotes at t factor J size Coyotes such as birth and death are taken into account in the COA life cycle. The development of coyotes is a mixture of two parents social conduct, which is randomly selected within the search area plus an environmental factor. The following is written for this life event:</p>
        <p>where, R j denotes a randomly distributed number within the boundaries of the design variable, while, r 1 and r 2 are the random coyote unit p, j 1 and j 2 , two random design variables, P s and P a are the scatter plate and association probability, and R j is the arbitrary number between 0 and 1. These probabilities indicate the cultural diversity of group coyotes and the following equations determine their values:</p>
        <p>where D is the development variables dimension. The COA uses two factors δ 1 and δ 2 to evaluate the cultural interaction between the different groups. This behavior can be mathematically formulated as follows: δ 2 = cult p,t soc p,t cr2 (21) where δ 1 denotes the culture deviation between a random coyote (cr 1 ) and alpha one in the same group and δ2 denotes the culture difference between a randomly selected coyote (cr 2 ) and the cultural tendency of the corresponding group.</p>
        <p>Then the social behavior of the coyote is revised, and the group control is modified as follows:</p>
        <p>where r 1 and r 2 are arbitrary numbers that range between [0, 1]. The new value of the fitness function of the coyotes is calculated as follows:</p>
        <p>If the social behavior in the present iteration is better than that of the last one, the current behavior will take place the previous one and mathematically presented as In the last stage of the process, the best environmental adaptation social behavior is chosen as the best solution. A flowchart describing the operation of the COA optimization technique is shown in Fig. 4.</p>
        <p>The applied COA optimization algorithm has been validated by estimating the optimal parameters of the different models of SCs and PV modules. The estimating models SDM, DDM, and TDM have been used for computing the PV characteristics as curves of power via voltage and current via voltage. The estimated performance (I/V) of each model has been compared with those of the datasheet of the tested cells and modules. The COA optimization algorithm has been applied to estimate the design parameters for models of the following commercial cells and PV modules; a typical (RTC France) silicon solar cell, (Photo Watt-PWP 201) PV module, Mono-crystalline SM55 module, Thin-film ST40 module, and Multi-crystalline module. The measured data and characteristics of the tested SCs and PV modules have been reported from several manufacturer's datasheets and Refs. [42]- [46]. For the applied optimization technique, the maximum number of iterations is adjusted at 1000 iterations while each population consists of 5 packs with 20 coyotes in each group. For each model, the optimization program has been implemented 30 times. The validation of the used optimization techniques has been taking place using the platform of MAT-LAB R2018a. Figure 5 shows the flow process of the application of COA for extracting the model parameters of SCs and PV modules. The results of the applied COA algorithm have been compared with those of other techniques based on the criterion of the best optimal value of the objective function.</p>
        <p>In this case of the study, the applied COA optimization algorithm was utilized to extract the parameters of the three proposed models of R.T.C. France solar cell. The measured data of the (I-V) characteristic curves of R.T.C. France solar cell are reported in [42], [43]. The optimization algorithm of COA is applied for extracting the parameters of the SDM, DDM, and TDM. The results of the optimized parameters based on the COA-based SDM model are listed in Table 1. Table 1 also includes the results of the estimated parameters based on COA and those estimated based on other optimization techniques such as ABSO [40], HS [36], PSO [25], GA [47], An.5-Pt. [48], LW [49], Newton [50], CM [51], and PS [52]. From this table, it can be noticed that for the SDM model, the application of the proposed COA algorithm results in the minimum value of the RMSE that is equal to 7.75470161606E-04.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Table 2 listed the results obtained from the application of the COA technique for extracting the parameters of DDM of the R.T.C. France solar cell. For validating the applied technique, the table also introduces the results of the application of other techniques of ABSO [53], HS [36], PSO [25], GA [47], ABC [42], SBMO [43], SSO [54], MSSO [54]. The table shows that the applied COA optimization technique has the best results with the minimum objective function of the RMSE that is 7.648012794E-04.</p>
        <p>For more validation, the COA algorithm has been applied for extracting the parameters of the TDM. The results of the TDM have been listed in Table 3. The results of the applied COA algorithm have been compared with those of other techniques of ABC [42], OBWOA [55], STBLO [48]. The recorded results of Table 3 validate that the applied COA optimization algorithm is better than the other techniques. The value of RMSE using the applied COA algorithm is the minimum and equals to 7.59756935254174E-04.</p>
        <p>Moreover, a comparison between the results of the three different models of SDM, DDM, and TDM based on the COA optimization technique has been introduced. Fig. 6 shows the convergence trends of the objective function (RMSE) for R.T.C. France solar cell based on COA for the three models (SDM, DDM, and TDM). From Fig. 6 and Tables 1, 2 and 3, it is noticeable that the convergence curve of the TDM is better than those of SDM and DDM. However, the results of the SDM and DDM are better than those of the reported methods from literature as listed in Figs. 1 and2.</p>
        <p>Error curves of the estimated and measured current data of RTC France solar cell for the three models based on the indices of individual absolute error (IAE) values and relative error (RE) values have been shown in Fig. 7 in order to confirm the precision of the optimized parameters and power of the applied optimization technique. Furthermore, the characteristics of the tested solar cell have been plotted based on the estimated parameters for the three different models compared with the measured ones as presented in Figs 8,9, and 10 for SDM, DDM, and TDM, respectively.</p>
        <p>Statistical analysis should be performed in order to trust the performance of the optimization technique and evaluate the robustness behavior of the COA. So, the optimization algorithm of COA has been executed for 30 implements. For each run, the best minimum objective function has been recorded and reported. Moreover, statistical indices such as the mean, standard deviation, relative error, the minimum and maximum over the 30 runs have been computed. The results of the statistical analysis of the application of the applied COA for the three different models have been listed in Table 4. The end values of the objective function over the 30 runs are shown in Fig. 11. The results of the statistical analysis prove that the COA algorithm is an effective algorithm for solving the optimization problem of parameters' identification of various mathematical models of R.T.C. France solar cell.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test has been applied for more validation of the applied algorithm. The results have been shown in Table 4. From the table, the P-value of the results for the SDM, DDM, and TDM are 1.7344E-06, 1.7344E-06, and 1.7344E-06, respectively while the Ranke is 1 for the three models. At the default 5% significance level, the value h = 1 indicates that the test rejects the null hypothesis of zero medians. The results of the P-values in Table 4 generated from the Wilcoxon test show that the results of COA are statistically significant.</p>
        <p>For more validating of the applied COA technique, the Effectiveness of the COA is assessed with the estimation of the optimal parameters of different models of the Photowatt-PWP201 PV module, which consists of 36 series connected silicon cells under operating condition of 1000 W/m 2 solar radiation and cell temperature of 45 • C [42], [43]. In this case of study, to validate the effectiveness and precision of the applied methodology, the obtained results have been compared with those reported in literature based on other techniques.</p>
        <p>The superior performance of the COA optimization algorithm has been tested for determining the parameters of the SDM regarding such module. The results have been listed in Table 5. The table also introduces a comparison with the results of other techniques of Newton [13], PS [52], OIS [56] and 1DAB [49]. The comparison validated the effectivity of the COA with respect to the other techniques. The RMSE based on the application of COA for extracting the parameters of SDM equals 2.94960692837E-3 which is the best one.</p>
        <p>For more validating, the COA is applied for estimating the parameters of the DDM and TDM models of Photowatt-PWP201 PV module. The optimized parameters of the DDM and TDM based on COA have been introduced in Table 6 and Table 7, respectively. Table 6 is also for comparing the results of the DDM-based COA with other techniques of WDOWOAPSO [50], GCPSO [57], TVACPSO [58], and ABC-DE [59]. The table validates the superiority of the applied COA algorithm with respect to the minimum value of the RMSE which equals 2.40412239424184E-3. Moreover, Table 7 shows the results of the COA for extracting the parameter of the TDM model for the Photowatt-PWP201 PV module and the value of the RMSE is 2.07378235398E-03. All results which are presented in Table 5 to Table 7 prove that the COA is effective with high accuracy to estimate the parameters of the different models of the Photowatt-PWP201 PV module, which is reflected in the reduction of RMSE value as the objective function. The convergence characteristics of the RMSE for the Photowatt-PWP201 module based on COA optimization method according to the three applied models have been illustrated in Fig. 12. Also, Fig. 12 shows the best value of the cost function for 30 separately run of the estimation process.</p>
        <p>The optimized parameters for the SDM, DDM, and TDM have been applied to plot the estimated I-V and P-V curves of the Photowatt-PWP201 module. The measured and the estimated curves based on COA have been visualized in Figs 13 to 15 for SDM, DDM and TDM models, respectively. The figures show that the estimated curves based on COA agreed with the experimental data. Moreover, the regression between the computed and experimentally measured curves is 1, which validates the COA based methodology. The statistical analysis has been applied to prove the robustness of COA optimization technique. The results of the statistical analysis have been listed in Table 8.

        <p>From the results, it is shown that the WDOWOAPSO [44], GCPSO [50] and TVACPSO [51] algorithms have RMSE values, which are better than that of COA with the DDM for Photowatt-PWP201 module. This may be one of COA limitations. However, the results of the COA are the best with the cases of SDM andi TDM.</p>
        <p>For this case study, the parameters of SDM, DDM and TDM have been estimated based on the COA optimization algorithm for three different PV modules of Mono-crystalline SM55, Thin-film ST40 and Multi-crystalline KC200GT. The estimated parameters have been extracted for the three PV modules under different operating conditions of solar radiation ranges between 200 W/m 2 and 1000 W/ m 2 while the cell temperature is kept constant at 25 • C. To further investigate effectiveness, the applied COA algorithm was utilized to estimate the parameters of the SDM, DDM and TDM of the 9. The table shows that under each intensity of solar radiation, the COA optimization algorithm is capable to estimate the parameters of SDM with acceptable values of RMSE for each PV module. The characteristics of the three different PV modules have been shown in Fig. 16. The figure shows a good agreement between the actual and estimated curves for the current and the power against voltage. For further validation of the COA based estimator; a comparison of the statistical results of the COA method for the three PV modules under study at various solar radiations and cell temperature of 25 • C according to the SDM have been listed in Table 10. The results prove that the COA can be used for extracting the PV For DDM, Table 11 shows the extracted parameters of the DDM of the three PV modules under different intensities of solar radiation and temperature of 25 • C. Moreover, Fig. 17 shows the characteristics of the PV modules based on the estimated parameters.

        <p>Furthermore, the parameters of TDM for each PV modules have been estimated based on the optimization algorithm of COA. The results of the TDM parameters have been listed in Table 13. Moreover, Fig. 18 shows that the estimated characteristics of each PV modules have a good agreement with actual characteristics under the different intensities of solar radiation.

        <p>In this paper, a recent coyote optimization algorithm has been utilized for tackling with the optimization problem of parameters' identification of solar cells and various PV modules. To evaluate the power of the applied optimization method, data from the datasheet of the manufacturer and measured data obtained from the literature for different solar cells and PV modules at various intensities solar radiations and temperature have been used. Three different models of solar cells and PV modules, namely single diode model (SDM), double diode model (DDM), and three diode model (TDM), have been involved in this study. The results obtained from the application of the COA have been compared with the results reported in the literature for other optimization methods, where the applied COA achieves the best values of the objective function (RMSE). In addition, three different types of PV modules; mono-crystalline, thin-film, and multi-crystalline have been used for the validation of the applied technique under different intensities of solar radiation and module temperature. Furthermore, parametric and non-parametric statistical study of the results of the optimization of the parameters of solar cells and PV modules have been conducted in order to ensure the accurateness and stability of the COA in solving the optimization problem. Accordingly, the simulation results proved the good agreement between the V-I characteristics based on the optimized parameters and the corresponding ones reported in the datasheet of the manufacturer. Finally, the applied COA successes to introduce itself as a competitor to other optimization algorithms for parameter extraction of different solar cells and PV modules. The application of COA for extracting the maximum power point of PV under partial shading may be considered in the future work. Moreover, the COA can be applied to optimize other engineering problems in numerous research areas such as smart grids and other renewable energy systems.</p>
