        <p>Quantum computers hold promise to enable efficient simulations of the properties of molecules and materials; however, at present they only permit ab initio calculations of a few atoms, due to a limited number of qubits. In order to harness the power of near-term quantum computers for simulations of larger systems, it is desirable to develop hybrid quantum-classical methods where the quantum computation is restricted to a small portion of the system. This is of particular relevance for molecules and solids where an active region requires a higher level of theoretical accuracy than its environment. Here, we present a quantum embedding theory for the calculation of strongly-correlated electronic states of active regions, with the rest of the system described within density functional theory. We demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the approach by investigating several defect quantum bits in semiconductors that are of great interest for quantum information technologies. We perform calculations on quantum computers and show that they yield results in agreement with those obtained with exact diagonalization on classical architectures, paving the way to simulations of realistic materials on near-term quantum computers.Quantum computers hold promise to enable efficient simulations of the properties of molecules and materials; however, at present they only permit ab initio calculations of a few atoms, due to a limited number of qubits.

        <p>In the last three decades, atomistic simulations based on the solution of the basic equation of quantum mechanics have played an increasingly important role in predicting the properties of functional materials, encompassing catalysts and energy storage systems for energy applications, and materials for quantum information science. Especially in the case of complex, heterogeneous materials, the great majority of first-principles simulations are conducted using density functional theory (DFT), which is in principle exact but in practice requires approximations to enable calculations. Within its various approximations, DFT has been extremely successful in predicting numerous properties of solids, liquids, and molecules, and in providing key interpretations to a variety of experimental results; however it is often inadequate to describe so-called strongly-correlated electronic states 1,2 . We will use here the intuitive notion of strong correlation as pertaining to electronic states that cannot be described by static mean-field theories. Several theoretical and computational methods have been developed over the years to treat systems exhibiting strongly-correlated electronic states, including dynamical mean-field theory 3,4 and quantum Monte-Carlo 5,6 ; in addition, ab initio quantum chemistry methods, traditionally developed for molecules, have been recently applied to solid state problems as well 7 . Unfortunately, these approaches are computationally demanding and it is still challenging to apply them to complex materials containing defects and interfaces, even using highperformance computing architectures.In the last three decades, atomistic simulations based on the solution of the basic equation of quantum mechanics have played an increasingly important role in predicting the properties of functional materials, encompassing catalysts and energy storage systems for energy applications, and materials for quantum information science.

        <p>Quantum computers hold promise to enable efficient quantum mechanical simulations of weakly and strongly-correlated molecules and materials alike [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17] ; in particular when using quantum computers, one is able to simulate systems of interacting electrons exponentially faster than using classical computers. Thanks to decades of successful experimental efforts, we are now entering the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era 18 , with quantum computers expected to have on the order of 100 quantum bits (qubits); unfortunately this limited number of qubits still prevents straightforward quantum simulations of realistic molecules and materials, whose description requires hundreds of atoms and thousands to millions of degrees of freedom to represent the electronic wavefunctions.

        <p>In this work, we present a quantum embedding theory built on DFT, which is scalable to large systems and which includes the effect of exchange-correlation interactions of the environment on active regions, thus going beyond commonly adopted approximations. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the theory, we compute ground and excited state properties of several spin-defects in solids including the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center [24][25][26][27][28][29][30] , the neutral silicon-vacancy (SiV) center [31][32][33][34][35][36] in diamond, and the Cr impurity (4+) in 4H-SiC [37][38][39] . These spin-defects are promising platforms for solid-state quantum information technologies, and they exhibit stronglycorrelated electronic states that are critical for the initialization and read-out of their spin states [40][41][42][43][44][45] . Our quantum embedding theory yields results in good agreement with existing measurements. In addition, we present theoretical predictions for the position and ordering of the singlet states of SiV and of Cr, and we provide an interpretation of experiments that have so far remained unexplained.In this work, we present a quantum embedding theory built on DFT, which is scalable to large systems and which includes the effect of exchange-correlation interactions of the environment on active regions, thus going beyond commonly adopted approximations.

        <p>We summarize our strategy in Fig. 1. Starting from an atomistic structural model of materials (e.g., obtained from DFT calculations or molecular dynamics simulations), we identify active regions with strongly-correlated electrons, which we describe with an effective Hamiltonian that includes the effect of the environment on the active region. This effective Hamiltonian is constructed using the quantum embedding theory described below, and its eigenvalues can be obtained by either classical algorithms such as exact diagonalization (FCI) or quantum algorithms.We summarize our strategy in Fig. 1.

        <p>Embedding theory A number of interesting quantum embedding theories have been proposed over the past decades 52 . For instance, density functional embedding theory has been developed to improve the accuracy and scalability of DFT calculations [53][54][55][56][57] . Density matrix embedding theory (DMET) [58][59][60] and various Green's function based approaches 61,62 , e.g., DMFT, have been developed to describe systems with strongly-correlated electronic states. At present, ab initio calculations of materials using DMET and DMFT have been limited to relatively small unit cells (a few tens of atoms) of pristine crystals, due to their high computational cost 63,64 . In this work, we present a quantum embedding theory that is applicable to strongly-correlated electronic states in realistic heterogeneous materials and we apply it to systems with hundreds of atoms. The theory, inspired by the constrained random phase approximation (cRPA) approach [65][66][67] , does not require the explicit evaluation of virtual electronic states 68,69 , thus making the method scalable to materials containing thousands of electrons. Furthermore, cRPA approaches contain a specific approximation (RPA) to the screened Coulomb interaction, which neglects exchangecorrelation effects and may lead to inaccuracies in the description of dielectric screening. Our embedding theory goes beyond the RPA by explicitly including exchange-correlation effects, which are evaluated with a recently developed finite-field algorithm 70,71 .Embedding theory A number of interesting quantum embedding theories have been proposed over the past decades 52 .

        <p>We first performed spin-restricted DFT calculations using hybrid functionals 73 to obtain a mean-field description of the defects and of the whole host solid. The spin restriction ensures that both spin channels are treated on an equal footing and that there is no spincontamination when building effective Hamiltonians. Based on our DFT results, we then selected active spaces that include singleparticle defect wavefunctions and relevant resonant and band edge states. We verified that the size of the chosen active spaces yields converged excitation energies (see SI). We then constructed effective Hamiltonians (Eqs. ( 1)-( 2)) by taking into account exchange-correlation effects, and we obtained many-body ground and excited states using classical (FCI) and, for selected cases, quantum algorithms (PEA, VQE). All calculations were performed at the spin triplet ground state geometries obtained by spinunrestricted DFT calculations, thus obtaining vertical excitation energies (equal to the sums of zero phonon line (ZPL) and Stokes energies). It is straightforward to extend the current approach to compute potential energy surfaces at additional geometries 1 , so as to include relaxations and Jahn-Teller effects 36,72 . In Fig. 2 we present atomistic structures, single-particle defect levels, and the many-body electronic structure of three spin-defects.

        <p>Despite significant efforts [33][34][35][36] , several important questions on the singlet states of SiV remain open. These states are crucial for a complete understanding of the optical cycle of the SiV center. Our predicted ordering of singlet states of SiV is shown in Fig. 2b. We find the vertical excitation energies of the 1 A 1u state to be slightly higher than that of the 3 A 2u -3 E u triplet manifold, suggesting that the intersystem crossing (ISC) from 3 A 2u or 3 E u to singlet states may be energetically unfavorable (first-order ISC to lower 1 E g and 1 A 1g states are forbidden). We note that the 1 E u and 1 A 2u states are much higher in energy than 1 A 1u and are not expected to play a significant role in the optical cycle. In addition the first-order ISC process from the lowest energy singlet state 1 E g to the 3 A 2g ground state is forbidden by symmetry. Overall our results indicate that the 3 A 2g state is populated through higher-order processes and therefore the spin-selectivity of the full optical cycle is expected to be low. While more detailed studies including spinorbit coupling are required for definitive conclusions, our predictions shed light on the strongly-correlated singlet states of SiV and provide a possible explanation for the experimental difficulties in measuring optically-detected magnetic resonance of SiV.Despite significant efforts [33][34][35][36] , several important questions on the singlet states of SiV remain open.

        <p>We now turn to Cr in 4H-SiC, where we considered the hexagonal configuration. We constructed effective Hamiltonians with the half-filling e level in the band gap and states near the conduction band minimum including resonance states. Upon solving the effective Hamiltonian, we predict the lowest excited state to be a 1 E state arising from e → e spin-flip transition, with excitation energy of 1.09 (0.86) eV based on embedding calculations beyond (within) the RPA. Results including exchange-correlation effects are in better agreement with the measured ZPL of 1.19 eV 37 , where the Stokes energy is expected to be small given the large Debye-Waller factor 39 . There is currently no experimental report for the triplet excitation energies of Cr in 4H-SiC, but our results are in good agreement with existing experimental measurements for Cr in GaN, a host material with a crystal field strength similar to that of 4H-SiC 38 . We predict the existence of a 3 E + 3 A 1 manifold at ≃ 1.4 eV and a 3 E 0 þ 3 A 0 2 manifold at ≃ 1.7 eV above the ground state (Fig. 2c), resembling the 3 T 2 manifold (1.2 eV) and 3 T 1 manifold (1.6 eV) for Cr in GaN observed experimentally 74 . We note that in many cases it is challenging to study materials containing transition metal elements with DFT 75 . The agreement between FCI results and experimental measurements clearly demonstrates that the embedding theory developed here can effectively describe the strongly-correlated part of the system, while yielding at the same time a quantitatively correct description of the environment.We now turn to Cr in 4H-SiC, where we considered the hexagonal configuration.

Results including exchange-correlation effects are in better agreement with the measured ZPL of 1.19 eV 37 , where the Stokes energy is expected to be small given the large Debye-Waller factor 39 . There is currently no experimental report for the triplet excitation energies of Cr in 4H-SiC, but our results are in good agreement with existing experimental measurements for Cr in GaN, a host material with a crystal field strength similar to that of 4H-SiC 38 . We predict the existence of a 3 E + 3 A 1 manifold at ≃ 1.4 eV and a 3 E 0 þ 3 A 0 2 manifold at ≃ 1.7 eV above the ground state (Fig. 2c), resembling the 3 T 2 manifold (1.2 eV) and 3 T 1 manifold (1.6 eV) for Cr in GaN observed experimentally 74 . We note that in many cases it is challenging to study materials containing transition metal elements with DFT 75 . The agreement between FCI results and experimental measurements clearly demonstrates that the embedding theory developed here can effectively describe the strongly-correlated part of the system, while yielding at the same time a quantitatively correct description of the environment.</p>
        <p>The results presented in the previous section were obtained using classical algorithms. We now turn to the use of quantum algorithms. To perform quantum simulations with PEA and VQE, we constructed a minimum model of an NV center including only a 1 and e orbitals in the band gap. This model (four electrons in six spin orbitals) yields excitation energies within 0.2 eV of the converged results using a larger active space. In Fig. 3 we show the results of quantum simulations.The results presented in the previous section were obtained using classical algorithms. We now turn to the use of quantum algorithms.

As shown in Fig. 3a, PEA results converge to classical FCI results with an increasing number of ancilla qubits.We first performed PEA simulations with a quantum simulator (without noise) 46 to compute the energy of 3 A 2 , 3 E, 1 E, and 1 A 1 states.

To obtain the M S = 0 ground state, we used a closed-shell Hartree-Fock state aae x e x j i as reference; the M S = 1 ground state is itself an open-shell Hartree-Fock state, so we started with a higher energy reference state ae x e x e y in the 3 E manifold. We used unitary coupled-cluster single and double (UCCSD) ansatzes 49 to represent the trial wavefunctions. Fig. 3b andc shows the estimated ground state energy as a function of the number of VQE iterations, where VQE calculations performed with the quantum simulator correctly converges to the ground state energy in both the M S = 1 and M S = 0 case. Despite the presence of noise, whose characterization and study will be critical to improve the use of quantum algorithms 76 , the results obtained with the quantum computer converge to the ground state energy within a 0.2 eV error.

        <p>With the goal of providing a strategy to solve complex materials problems on NISQ computers, we proposed a first-principles quantum embedding theory where appropriate active regions of a material and their environment are described with different levels of accuracy, and the whole system is treated quantum mechanically. In particular, we used hybrid DFT for the environment, and we built a many-body Hamiltonian for the active space with effective electron-electron interactions that include dielectric screening and exchange-correlation effects from the environment. Our method overcomes the commonly used random phase approximation, which neglects exchange-correlation effects; importantly it is applicable to heterogeneous materials and scalable to large systems, due to the algorithms used here to compute response functions 70,71 .

        <p>We presented results for spin-defects in semiconductors obtained with both classical and quantum algorithms, and we showed excellent agreement between the two sets of techniques. Importantly, for selected cases we showed results obtained using a quantum simulator and a quantum computer, which agree within a relatively small error, in spite of the presence of noise in the quantum hardware. We made several predictions for excited states of SiV in diamond and Cr in SiC, which provide important insights into their full optical cycle. We also demonstrated that a treatment of the dielectric screening beyond the random phase approximation leads to an accurate prediction of excitation energies.We presented results for spin-defects in semiconductors obtained with both classical and quantum algorithms, and we showed excellent agreement between the two sets of techniques.

        <p>The method proposed in our work enables calculations of realistic, heterogeneous materials using the resources of NISQ computers. We demonstrated quantum simulations of stronglycorrelated electronic states in considerably larger systems (with hundreds of atoms) than previous studies combining quantum simulation and quantum embedding [19][20][21][22][23] . We have studied solids with defects, not just pristine materials, which are of great interest for quantum technologies. The strategy adopted here is general and may be applied to a variety of problems, including the simulation of active regions in molecules and materials for the understanding and discovery of catalysts and new drugs, and of aqueous solutions containing complex dissolved species. We finally note that our approach is not restricted to stronglycorrelated active regions and will be useful also in the case of weakly correlated systems, where different regions of a material may be treated with varying levels of accuracy. Hence we expect the strategy presented here to be widely applicable to carry out quantum simulations of materials on near-term quantum computers.The method proposed in our work enables calculations of realistic, heterogeneous materials using the resources of NISQ computers.

        <p>Construction of effective Hamiltonians is performed with the WEST code 69 , starting from wavefunctions of spin-restricted DFT calculations. For this step, we remark that the use of hybrid functional is important for an accurate mean-field description of defect levels, even though the geometry of defects are well represented at the PBE level. We used a dielectric dependent hybrid (DDH) functional 73 which self-consistently determines the fraction of exact exchange based on the dielectric constant of the host material. In particular, 17.8% and 15.2% of exact exchange were used for the calculations of defects in diamond and 4H-SiC, respectively. The DDH functional was shown to yield accurate band gaps of diamond and silicon carbide, as well as optical properties of defects 41,42,[80][81][82] . After hybrid functional solutions of the Kohn-Sham equations are obtained, iterative diagonalizations of χ 0 are performed, and density response functions and f xc of the system are represented on a basis consisting of the first 512 eigenpotentials of χ 0 . Finite field calculations of f xc are performed by coupling the WEST code with the Qbox 83 code. FCI calculations 84 on the effective Hamiltonian are carried out using the
