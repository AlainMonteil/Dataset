        <p>We propose a simple scheme to reduce readout errors in experiments on quantum systems with finite number of measurement outcomes. Our method relies on performing classical postprocessing which is preceded by Quantum Detector Tomography, i.e., the reconstruction of a Positive-Operator Valued Measure (POVM) describing the given quantum measurement device. If the measurement device is affected only by an invertible classical noise, it is possible to correct the outcome statistics of future experiments performed on the same device. To support the practical applicability of this scheme for nearterm quantum devices, we characterize measurements implemented in IBM's and Rigetti's quantum processors. We find that for these devices, based on superconducting transmon qubits, classical noise is indeed the dominant source of readout errors.We propose a simple scheme to reduce readout errors in experiments on quantum systems with finite number of measurement outcomes.

Due to the advent of quantum cloud services (IBM [2,3], Rigetti [4], DWave [5]), any researcher has a possibility to perform experiments on actual quantum devices.

Hence, to properly characterize noise occurring in the devices and to develop error correction and mitigation schemes that may help to fight it have become tasks of fundamental importance [9,10,11,12,13,14,15].

        <p>In theoretical considerations about quantum information tasks, a quantum device is often assumed to perform perfect measurements. In practice, this assumption may be significantly violated due to experimental imperfections and noise. Specifically, a broad class of errors occurring in quantum devices may be described as State Preparation And Measurement (SPAM) errors [16,17]. It follows that if state preparation errors are negligible, one is able to reconstruct a POVM (Positive-Operator Valued Measure) associated with a given measurement device, and therefore to infer measurement errors. A standard method of such reconstruction is to perform Quantum Detector Tomography (QDT) [18]. Results of the QDT may be used to compare the reconstructed POVM with the ideal one [18] and to analyze the nature of measurement errors [19,20,21,22]. In this work, we propose to do more -we show how to use the knowledge about the POVM associated with a measurement device to correct the results obtained in further experiments performed on this device. Such a correction is possible provided the noise which affects the measurement is of a classical stochastic type and non-degenerate (invertible). In other words, such type of noise is equivalent to invertible classical post-processing of experimental statistics, and it may also be inverted solely by classical post-processing. The general idea of mitigating the effects of such a noise is the following. Assuming that one has access to the aforementioned invertible stochastic map describing a noise, it is straightforward to use the (generally non-stochastic) inversion of this map to classically reverse effects of noise simply by multiplying the vector of experimental statistics (obtained in a further experiment) by this inverted matrix, see Fig. 1. The main aim of this work is to present such a classical correction scheme together with the analysis of its accuracy. Specifically, we show how the deviations from classical noise model and finite-size statistics affect our procedure, by providing upper bounds for the distance of the corrected probability distribution from the ideal noise-reversed scenario.In theoretical considerations about quantum information tasks, a quantum device is often assumed to perform perfect measurements.

        <p>Besides the theoretical description, we also test our procedure experimentally. First, we present data that suggests that IBM's and Rigetti's quantum processors are affected by a significant readout noise that can be described (to a good approximation) by the classical model characterized above. Both architectures consist of superconducting transmon qubits [23], which may suggest that the classical noise may be the dominant form of measurement noise in such devices.

        <p>We will now comment on related works. There is a variety of recent research concerning the mitigation of different types of errors in contemporary quantum devices [9,10,11,12,13,14,15]. In particular, in the Appendix of work [12], authors assume the uncorrelated, classical noise model for readout errors and state that they use measurement calibration data to correct 'assignment errors'. We believe that this might refer to procedure-related to ours (under aforementioned assumptions). Similarly, in work [11] authors mention in the Appendix that they use 'readout calibration' to correct expectation values for assignment infidelity.We will now comment on related works.

        <p>Characterization of quantum devices requires knowledge of the POVM associated with a given measurement performed by the device. The procedure for obtaining this is known as Quantum Detector Tomography (QDT) [18]. The general idea of QDT is as follows. Recall that Born's rule associates the probabilities of particular outcomes with the expectation values of effects. If one performs multiple experiments on the set of quantum states which form a basis for Hermitian operators, then one may use the obtained statistics to decompose all effects on that basis via Born's rule. In the case of a d-dimensional Hilbert space, such a basis is d2 dimensional, and this is the minimal number of different experiments (different quantum states) that must be performed to reconstruct a POVM.Characterization of quantum devices requires knowledge of the POVM associated with a given measurement performed by the device.

        <p>Naturally, in practice one will not have access to perfect statistics, nor to the perfectly prepared quantum states. This may cause that the simple tomographic method returns nonphysical, non-positive POVM elements. To cope with this issue, the method of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) may be used, which asserts the positivity of the reconstructed quantum measurements [28,29]. In order to reconstruct POVMs from experimental data, we have thus implemented an iterative algorithm from [28] which converges to the MLE estimator.Naturally, in practice one will not have access to perfect statistics, nor to the perfectly prepared quantum states.

        <p>After reconstructing the POVMs, it is useful to have a distance measure between them in order to compare the reconstructed quantum measurements with the ideal detectors and, naturally, to compare detectors with each other. Distances between quantum measurements are usually closely related to the probability distributions that they generate via Born's rule. Therefore, first, we need a measure of the distance between classical probability distributions.

        <p>Now we will describe the model of classical noise that we are considering in this work. Let us denote by M ideal an n-outcome quantum measurement that in theory should be associated with our measurement device. In practice, due to the presence of noise, real measurement describing our device is some POVM M exp . In this model, we assume that the relation between M ideal and M exp is given by a (left) stochastic, invertible map Λ, whose element Λ i,j := p (i|j) ∈ [0, 1] are defined by equationNow we will describe the model of classical noise that we are considering in this work.

        <p>The left-stochastic property of Λ means that i Λ i,j = i p (i|j) = 1. Note that this property asserts that M exp is a proper POVM. The above equation is somewhat abstract since it provides a description of the noise on the measurement operators level. In order to find its operational interpretation, let us use the fact that since the noise affects only the measurement process, Eq. ( 7) is fulfilled for an arbitrary quantum state which is measured on the noisy device. For an arbitrary quantum state ρ, let us denote the ideal vector of probabilities that one would've obtained in the ideal device as p ideal , which should be understood as in Eq (5). Due to the linearity of Born's rule, from Eq. (7) it follows that the vector of probabilities p exp obtained in an experiment on a noisy device is given byThe left-stochastic property of Λ means that i Λ i,j = i p (i|j) = 1.

        <p>This allows us to give an intuitive interpretation of classical noise. Namely, the application of such noise is equivalent to the classical post-processing of the statistics that one would have obtained in an ideal scenario [36].

The experimental results presented in this work were obtained on publicly available devices. For this reason, it was not possible to perform all the experiments during a single calibration period. Consequently, the data presented throughout the paper may consist of values obtained in experiments performed on different days.

        <p>In order to be able to perform reliable Quantum Detector Tomography, one needs to assure accurate state preparation. Since the tensor product of single-qubit quantum gates suffices to prepare quantum states spanning the whole operator space, it is enough to analyze only single-qubit gate errors. Randomized benchmarking experiments [39,40] allow for inferring such errors in a manner approximately independent on state-preparation and measurement errors. In Table 1 we list average gate fidelities F RB for ibmqx4 device. The errors are relatively small (i.e., 1 -F RB is of order 0.1%) which indicates that the assumption of perfect state preparation is reasonable. The average gate fidelities in Rigetti's device are, however, worse, which makes it difficult to precisely gauge the errors introduced by our error-mitigation procedure.In order to be able to perform reliable Quantum Detector Tomography, one needs to assure accurate state preparation.

First, readout noise is significant for both platforms. We note that although it cannot be directly compared to the single-qubit gate errors from RB experiments, in the case of IBM ibmqx4 average gate fidelities are so large that the readout-noise can be considered as the predominant type of noise on the level of individual qubits (at least for short quantum circuits). Second, the distance between actual POVM and its diagonal form is in all cases small, which confirms the assertion that classical noise is the dominant type of noise in both devices. Lastly, we observe that the upper bound for our correction error ||Λ -1 || 1→1 D op M exp , ΛM ideal (see Eq.

[59] two-qubit quantum states using error-mitigation procedures based on a) uncorrelated single-qubit QDTs and b) correlated two-qubit QDT. The convention for presenting data is analogous to that of Fig. 9. Each tomography experiment consisted of 9 quantum circuits, corresponding to local measurements performed in different Pauli bases. Each quantum circuit was implemented 8192 times. Furthermore, each tomography experiment was repeated 5 times in order to estimate statistical errors, the corresponding 3σ intervals are shown on the barplot as black lines. The QDT used in the error-mitigation procedure was implemented using an over-complete set of states (all Pauli eigenstates), with each circuit implemented 32768 times.</p>
        <p>For the implementation of non-projective measurements via Naimark's extension, we observe the general improvement of the quality of reconstructed POVMs when the error-mitigation scheme is used (see Fig. 11). Moreover, the difference between error-mitigation procedure based on the non-correlated and on correlated detector tomography is negligible this time. However, we can offer a simpler explanation than in the case of two-qubit QSTs described above. Namely, at the time when those particular experiments were performed, correlations between errors for pair q 2 q 1 were relatively small (compared to data regarding quantum process tomography and quantum detector tomography). This points to the importance of performing systematic device characterization and calibration. The first bar in each pair depicts the operational distance between the to-be-implemented POVM and the one obtained in the measurement tomography based on uncorrected statistics (Dop); while the second bar shows the distance between the ideal POVM and the one reconstructed from a tomography based on statistics corrected by our scheme (D corr op ). The three regions separated by dashed lines correspond to different to-be-implemented POVMs: the Haar-random 4-outcome POVM, the tetrahedral measurement, and the trine measurement [59]. Each POVM reconstruction required 4 quantum circuits (Pauli 'x+','y+','z+' and 'z-' states) and each quantum circuit was implemented 8192 times. Reconstructions were repeated 5 times in order to estimate standard deviations, the corresponding 3σ intervals are shown here as black bars. The mitigation or measurement errors by our method was done based on a) separate single-qubit QDTs, and b) joint two-qubit QDT.

        <p>The probability distributions tested here were generated by performing a simple circuit (acting on the standard input state |0 ⊗5 ) followed by a measurement in the computational basis. We have chosen to implement the following three probability distributions: The first distribution was the uniform one and was implemented by the tensor product of five Hadamard gates. The second probability distribution, named 'NOT ', was implemented by the product of five X gates. For the last probability distribution, named by us 'Mixed ', the circuit consisted of two X gates on q 0 and q 2 , two Hadamards on q 3 and q 4 , and identity gate on q 1 . Results of the correction of the probability distributions are presented in Tab. 5. There are a few interesting features to be observed. First, let us note that in the case of the uniform probability distribution, our correction procedure is ineffective if we do not account for correlations between qubit readout errors. However, if we do account for such correlations in only a single pair of qubits (the highly correlated pair q 2 q 1 ), it is clear that correction procedure provides a high improvement 9 . Second, in the case of the 'NOT' probability distribution, the correlation-ignorant correction has attained the perfect estimation -yet with remarkably high distance α between first-guess non-physical probability vector and its closest physical neighbor. This moves us very close to the regime in which the correction is unreliable according to the criterion given in Eq. (29). Accounting for correlations this time proves to improve results also remarkably highly, this time with only slightly distant firstguess non-physical distribution. Finally, the method provides an advantage for the 'Mixed' distribution in both cases. However, interestingly, this time the difference of improvement after accounting for correlations is negligible.The probability distributions tested here were generated by performing a simple circuit (acting on the standard input state |0 ⊗5 ) followed by a measurement in the computational basis.

Our method uses solely classical post-processing that depends on the results obtained in the course of Quantum Detector Tomography. In principle, it can be applied on any quantum hardware provided the readout errors are classical and one has access to approximately perfect detector tomography. We have analyzed how our error-mitigation procedure is affected by non-classical noise and finite statistics (at the stage of estimation of probability distributions). We have also presented a comprehensive study confirming the (approximate) validity of the classicality of errors in the publicly available prototypes of quantum chips based on architectures with superconducting transmon qubits.In this work, we have presented a scheme for the mitigation of readout errors which is suitable for noisy and imperfect quantum devices.

Moreover, in the case of uncorrelated errors, such physical correction is in principle possible for an arbitrary number of qubits (provided that readout errors dominate over gate errors).

In particular, we have pointed out that the procedure is highly on the quantum state being measured.

        <p>In what follows we provide provide numerical arguments for approximate correctness of the above rule for single-qubit detectors and two-qubit uncorrelated detectors. First, let us note that the above inequality is in fact comparison of two bounds. On the LHS, we have the upper bound for the error for our mitigation procedure, i.e., the upper bound on TV-distance (Eq. (3)) between postprocessed statistics p * exp and the ideal statistics p ideal that one would have obtained on the non-noisy detector. On the RHS, we have an upper bound for TV-distance between non-post-processed statistics p est exp , and the p ideal . This is the worst possible error one would expect on the noisy detector without mitigation. Of course, in the real experiment, we do not have access to any particular p ideal , which makes such general figures of merit particularly useful. However, in the case of numerical simulations, when p ideal can be computed, we can use a quantum state sensitive criterion analogous to Eq.

(48) It is now natural to ask how often the above criterion is satisfied, when Haar-random quantum states are measured by the noisy detector M. To address this question, we perform the following numerical procedure. 47) is satisfied, the mitigation was successful in that case.In what follows we provide provide numerical arguments for approximate correctness of the above rule for single-qubit detectors and two-qubit uncorrelated detectors. First, let us note that the above inequality is in fact comparison of two bounds. On the LHS, we have the upper bound for the error for our mitigation procedure, i.e., the upper bound on TV-distance (Eq. (3)) between postprocessed statistics p * exp and the ideal statistics p ideal that one would have obtained on the non-noisy detector. On the RHS, we have an upper bound for TV-distance between non-post-processed statistics p est exp , and the p ideal . This is the worst possible error one would expect on the noisy detector without mitigation. Of course, in the real experiment, we do not have access to any particular p ideal , which makes such general figures of merit particularly useful. However, in the case of numerical simulations, when p ideal can be computed, we can use a quantum state sensitive criterion analogous to Eq. (47), namely D T V p * exp , p ideal &lt; D T V p est exp , p ideal ⇒ mitigation succesful .

        <p>We have studied how fraction f changes with growing ratio δ+α Dop(M,P)+ in the case of single-qubit detectors. To this aim, we have implemented the above algorithm for the range of magnitudes of off-diagonal terms of POVM's elements, while keeping diagonal terms from actual IBM's data. Results are shown in Fig. 12. For all qubits the fraction of corrected statistics crosses 50% in the region in which δ + α ≈ D op (M, P) + , which backs up rule give in Eq. (47). Furthermore, the fraction of successful error mitigations for actual experimental data lies between 88% and 99%, which suggests that for single-qubit experiments our protocol should be helpful in most cases. 1.0 f q 0 q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 For the two-qubit case we have tested POVMs created via the tensor product of single-qubit POVMs with increasing off-diagonal terms, again leaving diagonal terms from experimental data. Results of simulation are shown on Figure 13. Similarly to single-qubit case, fraction of successful mitigations crosses 50% around the regime where Eq. (47) becomes unsatisfied. Furthermore, for actual experimental data f takes values between 98.86% and 99.99%, which suggests that for uncorrelated pairs of qubits our mitigation procedure should be successful for generic quantum states.We have studied how fraction f changes with growing ratio δ+α Dop(M,P)+ in the case of single-qubit detectors.

        <p>Upon completion of this manuscript, we became aware of a recent work [62] that proposed an analogous scheme for the mitigation of readout errors. Furthermore, we note that 
            <rs type="creator">IBM</rs>'s 
            <rs type="software">qiskit</rs> package has been recently updated to include the readout error correction scheme, which seems to rely on an analogous procedure.
        </p>
        <p>We are making Python 
            <rs type="software">code</rs> implementing the ideas presented in this work publicly available in the form of GitHub repository: 
            <rs type="url">https://github.com/fbm2718/ QREM</rs>. We intend to further develop the repository in the future, adding new functionalities and tutorial Jupiter notebooks, which we hope will make our method more useful in practice.
