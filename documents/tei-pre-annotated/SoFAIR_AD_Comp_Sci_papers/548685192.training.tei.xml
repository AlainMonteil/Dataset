        <p>With advanced digitalisation, we can observe a massive increase of user-generated content on the web that provides opinions of people on different subjects. Sentiment analysis is the computational study of analysing people's feelings and opinions for an entity. The field of sentiment analysis has been the topic of extensive research in the past decades. In this paper, we present the results of a tertiary study, which aims to investigate the current state of the research in this field by synthesizing the results of published secondary studies (i.e., systematic literature review and systematic mapping study) on sentiment analysis. This tertiary study follows the guidelines of systematic literature reviews (SLR) and covers only secondary studies. The outcome of this tertiary study provides a comprehensive overview of the key topics and the different approaches for a variety of tasks in sentiment analysis. Different features, algorithms, and datasets used in sentiment analysis models are mapped. Challenges and open problems are identified that can help to identify points that require research efforts in sentiment analysis. In addition to the tertiary study, we also identified recent 112 deep learning-based sentiment analysis papers and categorized them based on the applied deep learning algorithms. According to this analysis, LSTM and CNN algorithms are the most used deep learning algorithms for sentiment analysis.With advanced digitalisation, we can observe a massive increase of user-generated content on the web that provides opinions of people on different subjects.

        <p>Sentiment analysis or opinion mining is the computational study of people's opinions, sentiments, emotions, and attitudes towards entities such as products, services, issues, events, topics, and their attributes (Liu 2015). As such, sentiment analysis can allow tracking the mood of the public about a particular entity to create actionable knowledge. Also, this type of knowledge can be used to understand, explain, and predict social phenomena (Pozzi et al. 2017). For the business domain, sentiment analysis plays a vital role in enabling businesses to improve strategy and gain insight into customers' feedback about their products. In today's customer-oriented business culture, understanding the customer is increasingly important (Chagas et al. 2018).Sentiment analysis or opinion mining is the computational study of people's opinions, sentiments, emotions, and attitudes towards entities such as products, services, issues, events, topics, and their attributes (Liu 2015).

        <p>The explosive growth of discussion platforms, product review websites, e-commerce, and social media facilitates a continuous stream of thoughts and opinions. This growth makes it challenging for companies to get a better understanding of customers' aggregate opinions and attitudes towards products. The explosion of internet-generated content coupled with techniques like sentiment analysis provides opportunities for marketers to gain intelligence on consumers' attitudes towards their products (Rambocas and Pacheco 2018). Extracting sentiments from product reviews helps marketers to reach out to customers who need extra care, which will improve customer satisfaction, sales, and ultimately benefits businesses (Vyas and Uma 2019).The explosive growth of discussion platforms, product review websites, e-commerce, and social media facilitates a continuous stream of thoughts and opinions.

        <p>Sentiment analysis is a multidisciplinary field, including psychology, sociology, natural language processing, and machine learning. Recently, the exponentially growing amounts of data and computing power enabled more advanced forms of analytics. Machine learning, therefore, became a dominant tool for sentiment analysis. There is an abundance of scientific literature available on sentiment analysis, and there are also several secondary studies conducted on the topic.Sentiment analysis is a multidisciplinary field, including psychology, sociology, natural language processing, and machine learning.

        <p>A secondary study can be considered as a review of primary studies that empirically analyze one or more research questions (Nurdiani et al. 2016). The use of secondary studies (i.e., systematic reviews) in software engineering was suggested in 2004, and the term "Evidence-based Software Engineering" (EBSE) was coined by Kitchenham et al. (2004). Nowadays, secondary studies are widely used as a well-established tool in software engineering research (Budgen et al. 2018).

        <p>• Systematic Literature Review (SLR): An SLR study aims to identify relevant primary studies, extract the required information regarding the research questions (RQs), and synthesize the information to respond to these RQs. It follows a well-defined methodology and assesses the literature in an unbiased and repeatable way (Kitchenham and Charters 2007). • Systematic Mapping Study (SMS): An SMS study presents an overview of a particular research area by categorizing and mapping the studies based on several dimensions (i.e., facets) (Petersen et al. 2008).• Systematic Literature Review (SLR): An SLR study aims to identify relevant primary studies, extract the required information regarding the research questions (RQs), and synthesize the information to respond to these RQs.

        <p>SLR and SMS studies are different than traditional review papers (a.k.a., survey articles) because we systematically search in electronic databases and follow a well-defined protocol to identify the articles. There are also several differences between SLR and SMS studies (Catal and Mishra 2013;Kitchenham et al. 2010b). For instance, while RQs of the SLR studies are very specific, RQs of SMS are general. The search process of the SLR is driven by research questions, but the search process of the SMS is based on the research topic. For the SLR, all relevant papers must be retrieved, and quality assessments of identified articles must be performed; however, requirements for the SMS are less stringent.SLR and SMS studies are different than traditional review papers (a.k.a., survey articles) because we systematically search in electronic databases and follow a well-defined protocol to identify the articles.

        <p>When there is a sufficient number of secondary studies on a research topic, a tertiary study can be performed (Kitchenham et al. 2010a;Nurdiani et al. 2016). A tertiary study synthesizes data from secondary studies and provides a comprehensive review of research in a research area (Rios et al. 2018). They are used to summarize the existing secondary studies and can be considered as a special form of review that uses other secondary studies as primary studies (Raatikainen et al. 2019).When there is a sufficient number of secondary studies on a research topic, a tertiary study can be performed (Kitchenham et al. 2010a;Nurdiani et al. 2016).

        <p>Although sentiment analysis has been the topic of some SLR studies, a tertiary study characterizing these systematic reviews has not been performed yet. As such, the aim of our study is to identify and characterize systematic reviews in sentiment analysis and present a consolidated view of the published literature to better understand the limitations and challenges of sentiment analysis. We follow the research methodology guidelines suggested for the tertiary studies (Kitchenham et al. 2010a).Although sentiment analysis has been the topic of some SLR studies, a tertiary study characterizing these systematic reviews has not been performed yet.

        <p>Sentiment analysis and opinion mining are often used interchangeably. Some researchers indicate a subtle difference between sentiments and opinions, namely that opinions are more concrete thoughts, whereas sentiments are feelings (Pozzi et al. 2017). However, sentiment and opinion are related constructs, and both sentiment and opinion are included when referring to either one. This research adopts sentiment analysis as a general term for both opinion mining and sentiment analysis.Sentiment analysis and opinion mining are often used interchangeably.

        <p>Sentiment analysis is a broad concept that consists of many different tasks, approaches, and types of analysis, which are explained in this section. In addition, an overview of sentiment analysis is represented in Fig. 1, which is adapted from (Hemmatian and Sohrabi 2017;Kumar and Jaiswal 2020;Mite-Baidal et al. 2018;Pozzi et al. 2017;Ravi and Ravi 2015). Cambria et al. (2017) stated that a holistic approach to sentiment analysis is required, and only categorization or classification is not sufficient. They presented the problem as a three-layer structure that includes 15 Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems as follows:Sentiment analysis is a broad concept that consists of many different tasks, approaches, and types of analysis, which are explained in this section.

        <p>Sentiment analysis models can adopt different pre-processing methods and apply a variety of feature selection methods. While pre-processing means transforming the text into normalized tokens (e.g., removing article words and applying the stemming or lemmatization techniques), feature selection means determining what features will be used as inputs.

        <p>One of the most widely known and researched tasks in sentiment analysis is sentiment classification. Polarity determination is a subtask of sentiment classification and is often improperly used when referring to sentiment analysis. However, it is merely a subtask aimed at identifying sentiment polarity in each text document. Traditionally, polarity is classified as either positive or negative (Wang et al. 2014). Some studies include a third class called neutral. Cross-domain and cross-language classification are subtasks of sentiment classification that aim to transfer knowledge from a data-rich source domain to a target domain where data and labels are limited. The cross-domain analysis predicts the sentiment of a target domain, with a model (partly) trained on a more data-rich source domain. A popular method is to extract domain invariant features whose distribution in the source domain is close to that of the target domain (Peng et al. 2018). The model can be extended with target domain-specific information. The cross-language analysis is practiced in a similar way by training a model on a source language dataset and testing it on a different language where data is limited, for example by translating the target language to the source language before processing (Can et al. 2018). Xia et al. (2015) stated that opinion-level context is beneficial to solve polarity ambiguity of sentiment words and applied the Bayesian model. Word polarity ambiguity is one of the challenges that need to be addressed for sentiment analysis. Vechtomova (2017) showed that the information retrieval-based model is an alternative to machine learning-based approaches for word polarity disambiguation.One of the most widely known and researched tasks in sentiment analysis is sentiment classification.

        <p>Subjectivity classification is a task to determine the existence of subjectivity in the text (Kasmuri and Basiron 2017). The goal of subjectivity classification is to restrict unwanted objective data objects for further processing (Kamal 2013). It is often considered the first step in sentiment analysis. Subjectivity classification detects subjective clues, words that carry emotion or subjective notions like 'expensive', 'easy', and 'better' (Kasmuri and Basiron 2017). These clues are used to classify text objects as subjective or objective.Subjectivity classification is a task to determine the existence of subjectivity in the text (Kasmuri and Basiron 2017).

        <p>The growing popularity of e-commerce websites and review websites caused opinion spam detection to be a prominent issue in sentiment analysis. Opinion spams also referred to as false or fake reviews are intelligently written comments that either promote or discredit a product. Opinion spam detection aims to identify three types of features that relate to a fake review: review content, metadata of review, and real-life knowledge about the product (Ravi and Ravi 2015). Review content is often analyzed with machine learning techniques to uncover deception. Metadata includes the star rating, IP address, geo-location, user-id, etc.; however, in many cases, it is not accessible for analysis. The third method includes real-life knowledge. For instance, if a product has a good reputation, and suddenly the inferior product is rated superior in some period, reviews of that period might be suspected.The growing popularity of e-commerce websites and review websites caused opinion spam detection to be a prominent issue in sentiment analysis.

        <p>Implicit language refers to humor, sarcasm, and irony. There are vagueness and ambiguity in this form of speech, which is sometimes hard to detect even for humans. However, an implicit meaning to a sentence can completely flip the polarity of a sentence. Implicit language detection often aims at understanding facts related to an event. For example, in the phrase "I love pain", pain is a factual word with a negative polarity load. The contradiction of the factual word 'pain' and subjective word 'love' can indicate sarcasm, irony, and humor. More traditional methods for implicit language detection include exploring clues such as emoticons, expressions for laughter, and heavy punctuation mark usage (Filatova 2012).Implicit language refers to humor, sarcasm, and irony.

        <p>Aspect extraction refers to retrieving the target entity and aspects of the target entity in the document. The target entity can be a product, person, event, organization, etc. (Akshi Kumar and Sebastian 2012). People's opinions on various parts of a product need to be identified for fine-grained sentiment analysis (Ravi and Ravi 2015). Aspect extraction is especially important in sentiment analysis of social media and blogs that often do not have predefined topics.Aspect extraction refers to retrieving the target entity and aspects of the target entity in the document.

        <p>Multiple methods exist for aspect extraction. The first and most traditional method is frequency-based analysis. This method finds frequently used nouns or compound nouns (POS tags), which are likely to be aspects. A rule of thumb that is often used is that if the (compound) noun occurs in at least 1% of the sentences, it is considered an aspect. This straightforward method turns out to be quite powerful (Schouten and Frasincar 2016). However, there are some drawbacks to this method (e.g., not all nouns are referring to aspects).Multiple methods exist for aspect extraction.

        <p>Syntax-based methods find aspects by means of syntactic relations they are in. A simple example is identifying aspects that are preceded by a modifying adjective that is a sentiment word. This method allows for low-frequency aspects to be identified. The drawback of this method is that many relations need to be found for complete coverage, which requires knowledge of sentiment words. Extra aspects can be found if more sentiment words that serve as adjectives can be identified. Qiu et al. (2009) propose a syntax-based algorithm that identifies aspects as well as sentiment words that works both ways. The algorithm identifies sentiment words for known aspects and aspects for known sentiment words.Syntax-based methods find aspects by means of syntactic relations they are in.

        <p>The unsupervised learning methods group unlabelled data into clusters that are similar to each other. For example, the algorithm can consider data as similar based on common words or word pairs in the document (Li and Liu 2014).The unsupervised learning methods group unlabelled data into clusters that are similar to each other. For example, the algorithm can consider data as similar based on common words or word pairs in the document (Li and Liu 2014).</p>
        <p>Semi-supervised learning uses both labeled and unlabelled data in the training process (da Silva et al. 2016a, b). A set of unlabelled data is complemented with some examples of labeled data (often limited) included building a classifier. This technique can yield decent accuracy and requires less human effort compared to supervised learning. In cross-domain and cross-language classification, domain, or language invariant features can be extracted with the help of unlabelled data, while fine-tuning the classifier with labeled target data (Peng et al. 2018). Semi-supervised learning is especially popular for Twitter sentiment analysis, where large sets of unlabelled data are available (da Silva et al. 2016a, b). Hussain and Cambria (2018) compared the computational complexity of several semi-supervised learning methods and presented a new semi-supervised model based on biased SVM (bSVM) and biased Regularized Least Squares (bRLS). Wu et al. (2019) developed a semisupervised Dimensional Sentiment Analysis (DSA) model using the variational autoencoder algorithm. DSA calculates the sentiment score of texts based on several dimensions, such as dominance, valence, and arousal. Xu and Tan (2019) proposed the target-oriented semi-supervised sequential generative model (TSSGM) for target-oriented aspect-based sentiment analysis and showed that this approach outperforms two semi-supervised learning methods. Han et al. (2019) developed a semi-supervised model using dynamic thresholding and multiple classifiers for sentiment analysis. They evaluated their model on the Large Movie Review dataset and showed that it provides higher performance than the other models. Duan et al. (2020) proposed the Generative Emotion Model with Categorized Words (GEM-CW) model for stock message sentiment classification and demonstrated that this model is effective. Gupta et al. (2018) investigated the semi-supervised approaches for low resource sentiment classification and showed that their proposed methods improve the model performance against supervised learning models.Semi-supervised learning uses both labeled and unlabelled data in the training process (da Silva et al. 2016a, b).

They evaluated their model on the Large Movie Review dataset and showed that it provides higher performance than the other models. Duan et al. (2020) proposed the Generative Emotion Model with Categorized Words (GEM-CW) model for stock message sentiment classification and demonstrated that this model is effective. Gupta et al. (2018) investigated the semi-supervised approaches for low resource sentiment classification and showed that their proposed methods improve the model performance against supervised learning models.</p>
        <p>The most widely known machine learning method is supervised learning. This approach trains a model with labeled source data. The trained model can subsequently make predictions for an output considering new unlabelled input data. In most cases, supervised learning often outperforms unsupervised and semi-supervised learning approaches, but the dependency on labeled training data can require lots of human effort and is therefore sometimes inefficient (Hemmatian and Sohrabi 2017).The most widely known machine learning method is supervised learning.

        <p>Machine learning methods are increasingly popular for aspect extraction. The most commonly used approach for aspect extraction is topic modeling, an unsupervised method that assumes any document contains a certain amount of hidden topics (Hemmatian and Sohrabi 2017). Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm, which has many different variations, is a popular topic modeling algorithm (Nguyen and Shirai 2015) that allows observations to be explained by unsupervised grouping of similar data. LDA outputs some topics of a text document and attributes each word in the document to one of the identified topics. The drawback of machine learning methods is that they require lots of labeled data.Machine learning methods are increasingly popular for aspect extraction.

        <p>After investigating these above-mentioned survey and highly cited articles, we searched in 
            <rs type="software">Google Scholar</rs> by using our search criteria (i.e., "deep learning" and "sentiment analysis") to reach the recent state-of-the-art deep learning-based studies published in 2020. We retrieved 112 deep learning-based sentiment analysis papers published in 2020 and extracted the applied deep learning algorithms from these papers. In Appendix (Table 16), we present these recent deep learning-based sentiment analysis papers. In Table 3, we show the distribution of applied deep learning algorithms used in these 112 recent papers.

        <p>According to this table, the most applied algorithm is the LSTM algorithm (i.e., 35.53%) and the second most used algorithm is CNN (i.e., 33.33%). The other widely used algorithms are GUR (i.e., 8.77%) and RNN (i.e., 7.89%) algorithms. However, the other well-known deep learning algorithms such as DNN, Recursive Neural Network (ReNN), Capsule Network (CapN), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Deep Q-Network, and Autoencoder have not been preferred much and used only in a few studies. Most of the hybrid approaches also combined the CNN and LSTM algorithms and therefore, they were represented under these categories. As this analysis indicates, most of the recent deep learning-based studies followed the supervised learning machine learning approach.According to this table, the most applied algorithm is the LSTM algorithm (i.e., 35.53%) and the second most used algorithm is CNN (i.e., 33.33%).

        <p>The traditional approach for sentiment analysis is the lexicon-based approach (Hemmatian and Sohrabi 2017). Lexicon-based methods scan through the documents for words that express positive or negative feelings to humans. Negatives words would be 'bad', 'ugly', 'scary' while positive words are, for example, 'good' or 'beautiful'. The values of these words are documented in a lexicon. Words with high positive or negative values are mostly adjectives and adverbs. Sentiment analysis shows to be extremely dependent on the domain of interest (Vinodhini 2012). For example, analyzing movie reviews can yield very different results compared to analyzing Twitter data due to different forms of language used. Therefore, the lexicon used for sentiment analysis needs to be adjusted according to the domain of interest. This can be a time-consuming process. However, lexicon-based methods do not require training data, which is a big advantage (Shayaa et al. 2018).The traditional approach for sentiment analysis is the lexicon-based approach (Hemmatian and Sohrabi 2017).

        <p>There are two main approaches to creating sentiment lexicons: dictionary-based and corpus-based. The dictionary-based approach starts with a small set of sentiment words, and iteratively expands the lexicon with synonyms and antonyms from existing dictionaries. In most cases, the dictionary-based approach works best for general purposes. Corpus-based lexicons can be tailored to specific domains. The approach starts with a list of general-purpose sentiment words and discovers other sentiment words from a domain corpus based on co-occurring word patterns (Mite-Baidal et al. 2018).There are two main approaches to creating sentiment lexicons: dictionary-based and corpus-based.

        <p>There are different hybrid approaches in the literature. Some of them aim to extend machine learning models with lexicon-based knowledge (Behera et al. 2016). The goal is to combine both methods to yield optimal results using an effective feature set of both lexicon and machine learning-based techniques (Munir Ahmad et al. 2017). This way, the deficiencies and limitations of both approaches can be overcome.There are different hybrid approaches in the literature.

        <p>Recently, researchers focused on the integration of symbolic and subsymbolic Artificial Intelligence (AI) for sentiment analysis (Cambria et al. 2020). Machine learning (also, deep learning) is considered to be a bottom-up approach and applies subsymbolic AI. This is extremely useful for exploring a huge amount of data and discovering interesting patterns in the data. Although this type of bottom-up approach works quite well for image classification tasks, they are not very effective for natural language processing tasks. For effective communication, we learn many issues such as cultural awareness and commonsense in a top-down manner instead of a bottom-up manner (Cambria et al. 2020). Therefore, these researchers applied subsymbolic AI (i.e., deep learning) to recognize patterns in text and represented them in a knowledge base using symbolic AI (i.e., logic and semantic networks). They built a new commonsense knowledge base called SenticNet for the sentiment analysis problem and concluded that coupling symbolic AI and subsymbolic AI is crucial to passing to the natural language understanding stage from natural language processing. Minaee et al. ( 2019) developed an ensemble model using LSTM and CNN algorithm and demonstrated that this ensemble model provides better performance than the individual models.Recently, researchers focused on the integration of symbolic and subsymbolic Artificial Intelligence (AI) for sentiment analysis (Cambria et al. 2020).

        <p>Sentiment analysis can be implemented at the following three levels: document, sentence, and aspect level. We elaborate on these in the next paragraphs.Sentiment analysis can be implemented at the following three levels: document, sentence, and aspect level.

        <p>Document-level analysis considers the whole text document as a unit of analysis (Wang et al. 2014). It is a simplified task that presumes that the entire document originates from a single opinion holder. Document analysis comes with some issues, namely that there could be multiple and mixed opinions in a document expressed in many different ways, sometimes with implicit language (Akshi Kumar and Sebastian 2012). Typically, documents are revised on a sentence or aspect level before determining the polarity of the entire text document.Document-level analysis considers the whole text document as a unit of analysis (Wang et al. 2014).

        <p>Sentence-level analysis considers specific sentences in a text and is especially used for subjectivity classification. Text documents typically consist of sentences that either contain opinion or not. Subjectivity classification analyses individual sentences in a document to detect whether the sentence contains facts or emotions and opinions. The main goal of Fig. 2 Milestones of sentiment analysis research for the last decade subjectivity classification is to exclude sentences that do not contain sentiment or opinion (Akshi Kumar and Sebastian 2012). This analysis often includes subjectivity classification as a step to either include or exclude sentences for analysis.Sentence-level analysis considers specific sentences in a text and is especially used for subjectivity classification.

        <p>Aspect-level analysis is a challenging topic in sentiment analysis. It refers to analyzing sentiments about specific entities and their aspects in a text document, not merely the overall sentiment of the document (Tun Thura Thet et al. 2010). It is also known as entity-level or feature-level analysis. Even though the general sentiment of a document may be classified as positive or negative, the opinion holder can have a divergent opinion about specific aspects of an entity (Akshi Kumar and Sebastian 2012). In order to measure aspect-level opinion, aspects of the entity need to be identified. Valdivia et al. (2017) stated that aspectbased sentiment analysis is beneficial to the business manager because customer opinions are extracted in a transparent way. Also, they reported that ironic expression detection in 
            <rs type="software">TripAdvisor</rs> is still an open problem and also, labeling of reviews should not only focus on user ratings because some users write positive sentences on negative user ratings and vice versa. Poria et al. (2016) proposed a new algorithm called Sentic LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and improved the LDA algorithm with semantic similarity for aspectbased sentiment analysis. They concluded that this new algorithm helps researchers to pass to the semantics analysis from the syntactical analysis in aspect-based sentiment analysis by using the common-sense computing (Cambria et al. 2009) and improves the clustering process (Poria et al. 2016).

        <p>Several survey articles discussed the popular lexicons used in sentiment analysis. Dang et al. (2020) 2020) explained the following datasets used for sentiment analysis: Yelp, IMDB, Movie Review, SST, MPQA, Amazon, and aspect-based sentiment analysis datasets (SemEval 2014 Task-4, Twitter, and SentiHood). Researchers who would like to perform a new study are suggested to look at these articles because links and other details per lexicon are presented in detail in these articles.Several survey articles discussed the popular lexicons used in sentiment analysis.

        <p>Several studies have been performed to compare the performance of existing models for sentiment analysis. Each model has its own advantages and weaknesses. For the aspectbased sentiment analysis, Do et al. (2019) divided models based on the following three categories: CNN, RNN, and Recurrent Neural Networks. The advantages of CNN-based models are fast computation, the ability to extract local patterns and represent non-linear dynamics. The disadvantage of the CNN-based model is the high demand for data. The advantages of RNN-based models are that they do not require a huge amount of data, they have a distributed hidden state that stores previous computations, and they require fewer parameters. The disadvantages are that they cannot capture long-term dependencies, and they select the last hidden state to represent the sentence. The advantages of Recurrent Neural Networks are their simple architectures and their ability to learn tree structures. The disadvantages are that they require parsers that might be slow, and they are still at early stages. It was reported that RNN-based models provide better performance than CNN-based models, and more research is required for Recurrent Neural Networks. Yadav and Vishwakarma (2019) reported that deep learning-based models are gaining popularity for different sentiment analysis tasks. They stated that CNN followed by LSTM (an RNN algorithm) provides the highest accuracy for document-level sentiment classification, researchers focused on RNN algorithms (particularly, LSTM) for sentence-level sentiment classification and aspect-level sentiment classification, and RNN models the bestperforming ones for multi-domain sentiment classification. They also discussed the merits and demerits of CNN, Recursive Neural Networks (RecNN), RNN, LSTM, GRU, DBN models.Several studies have been performed to compare the performance of existing models for sentiment analysis. Each model has its own advantages and weaknesses. For the aspectbased sentiment analysis, Do et al. (2019) divided models based on the following three categories: CNN, RNN, and Recurrent Neural Networks. The advantages of CNN-based models are fast computation, the ability to extract local patterns and represent non-linear dynamics. The disadvantage of the CNN-based model is the high demand for data. The advantages of RNN-based models are that they do not require a huge amount of data, they have a distributed hidden state that stores previous computations, and they require fewer parameters. The disadvantages are that they cannot capture long-term dependencies, and they select the last hidden state to represent the sentence. The advantages of Recurrent Neural Networks are their simple architectures and their ability to learn tree structures. The disadvantages are that they require parsers that might be slow, and they are still at early stages. It was reported that RNN-based models provide better performance than CNN-based models, and more research is required for Recurrent Neural Networks.

(2018) research opinion mining of hotel reviews specifically aimed at sustainability practices aspects. Limited information on used features is available. The following sections dive into the different models that are used in sentiment analysis, including adopted features, approaches, and datasets.</p>

        <p>Table 10 depicts the common input and output features that articles present for the sentiment analysis approach. Checkmarks indicate that the features are explicitly discussed in the referred article. Traditional approaches commonly use Bag-Of-Words (BOW) method. BOW counts the words, referred to as n-grams, in the text and creates a sparse vector with 1 s for present words and 0 s for absent words. These vectors are used as input to machine learning models. N-grams are sets of words that occur next to each other that are combined into one feature. This way, the order of words will be maintained when the text is vectorized. Part-Of-Speech (POS) tags provide feature tags for similar words with a different part of speech in the context. The term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) method highlights words or word pairs that often occur in one document but are low in frequency in the entire text corpus. Negation is an important feature to include in lexiconbased approaches. Negation means contradicting or denying something, which can flip the polarity of an opinion or sentiment.Table 10 depicts the common input and output features that articles present for the sentiment analysis approach.

        <p>Word embeddings are often used as feature learning techniques in deep learning models. Word embeddings are dense vectors with real numbers for a word or sentence in the text based on the context of the word in the text corpus. This approach, although considered promising, is only discussed to a limited extent in the selected articles.Word embeddings are often used as feature learning techniques in deep learning models.

        <p>Output variables differ per sentiment analysis task. Output classes of the identified secondary studies are polarity, subjectivity, emotions classes, or spam identification. Polarity indicates the extent to which the input is considered positive or negative in sentiment. In most cases, the output is classified in a binary way, either positive or negative. Some models include a neutral class as well. Multiple classes of polarity are shown to drastically reduce performance (Al-Moslmi et al. 2017) and are, therefore, not frequently used. One study (Madhala et al. 2018) focuses specifically on emotion classification, with up to 51 different classes of emotions. Some studies (Ahmed Ibrahim and Salim 2013; Kasmuri and Basiron 2017) include subjectivity analysis as part of sentiment analysis. Finally, spam detection is an important task in sentiment analysis, referring to extracting illegitimate means for a review. Examples of spam are untruthful opinions, reviews on the brand instead of on the product, and non-reviews like advertisements and random questions or text (Jindal and Liu 2008).Output variables differ per sentiment analysis task.

        <p>A clear pattern exists in the use of input and output features. Traditional machine learning models commonly use unigrams and n-grams as input. Variable features are TF-IDF values and POS-tags. Not every feature extraction method is as effective in differing domains. Combinations of input features are often made to reach better performance. Word embeddings are upcoming input features. The most recent articles (Kumar and Garg 2019; Kumar and Jaiswal 2020) explicitly discuss them. Text classification with word embeddings as input is considered a promising technique that is often combined with deep learning methods like recurrent neural networks. The output shows a similar pattern with common and variable features. The common feature is polarity, and variable output features include emotions, subjectivity, and spam type. 4.2 RQ2 "What are the adopted approaches in sentiment analysis?"A clear pattern exists in the use of input and output features.

        <p>Different tasks in sentiment analysis require different approaches. Therefore, it is important to note which task requires which approach. Table 11 shows the categories that are used throughout different sentiment analysis tasks.Different tasks in sentiment analysis require different approaches.

        <p>Traditional ML algorithms are still widely used in all kinds of sentiment analysis tasks, including sentiment classification. While deep learning is a promising field, in many cases, traditional ML performs sufficiently well or even better for a specific task compared to deep learning methods, usually on smaller datasets. The traditional supervised machine learning algorithms are Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Neural Networks (NN), Logistic Regression (LogR), Maximum Entropy (ME), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Trees (DT).Traditional ML algorithms are still widely used in all kinds of sentiment analysis tasks, including sentiment classification.

        <p>Lexicon-based learning is a traditional approach to sentiment analysis. Lexicon-based methods scan through the documents for words that express positive or negative feelings to humans. Words are defined in a lexicon beforehand, so no learning data is required for this approach.Lexicon-based learning is a traditional approach to sentiment analysis.

        <p>Ensemble classifiers approach adopts multiple learning algorithms to obtain better performance (Behera et al. 2016). Three main types of ensemble classification methods are bagging (bootstrap aggregating), boosting, and stacking. The bagging method independently learns homogeneous algorithms with data points randomly picked from the training set, following a deterministic averaging process. Boosting learns homogeneous algorithms in a sequential and adaptive way before following an averaging process. Stacking learns heterogeneous classifiers in parallel and combines them to predict an output. An overview of ensemble classifiers is shown in Table 13. Support Vector Machines (SVM) is the dominant algorithm in the field of sentiment classification. All selected papers include SVM for classification purposes, and in most cases, this technique yields the best performance. Naive Bayes is the second most used algorithm and is praised for its high performance despite the simplicity of the technique. Besides these two dominant algorithms, methods like NN, LogR, ME, kNN, RF, and DT are used throughout different tasks of sentiment analysis. A popular unsupervised approach for aspect extraction is LDA. Hybrid approaches to sentiment classification have been effective by using domain-specific knowledge to create extra features that enhance the performance of the model. Ensemble and hybrid methods often improve the performance and reliability of predictions.Ensemble classifiers approach adopts multiple learning algorithms to obtain better performance (Behera et al. 2016).

        <p>Deep learning algorithms are rising techniques in sentiment analysis. Especially, RNNs and the more complex RNN architecture, LSTM, are increasing in popularity. Even though deep learning is promising for increasing the performance of NLP and sentiment analysis models (Al-Moslmi et al. 2017;Kumar and Garg 2019;Kumar and Jaiswal 2020;Socher et al. 2013), the selected papers only discuss deep learning to a limited extent. The papers that discuss deep learning algorithms are recent papers published in 2018 and 2019, which stresses that sentiment analysis is a timely research subject and that the state-of-the-art is evolving rapidly.

        <p>Datasets for sentiment analysis are typically user-generated textual content. The text differs a lot depending on the domain and platform that the content is derived from. For example, social media data is usually very subjective and full of informal speech, whereas news article websites are mostly objective and formally written. Twitter data is limited to a certain number of characters and contains hashtags and references, whereas product review websites take a specific product into account and describe this in-depth. ML models trained on a specific domain provide poor performance when tested on a dataset from a different domain. Different domains have different language use and, therefore, require different methods for analysis. Table 14 depicts the domains of the adopted datasets per study. Checkmarks indicate that datasets from the domain are explicitly mentioned in the referred article. Social media data is the most widely used source of data. This data is usually easy to obtain through APIs. Especially, tweets are popular because they are relatively similar in format (e.g., a limited number of characters). Twitter has an API where tweets can be scraped on specific subjects, time range, hashtags, etc. Tweets contain worldwide realtime information on entities. Furthermore, scraped tweets contain information about the location, number of retweets, number of likes, and much more. Some reviewed articles focus specifically on Twitter data (Ahmed Ibrahim and Salim 2013;Kumar and Jaiswal 2020).

        <p>Reviews of products, hotels, and movies are also commonly used for text classification models. Reviews are usually combined with a star rating (i.e., label), which makes them suitable for machine learning models. Star ratings indicate polarity. This way, no laborintensive manual labeling process or predefined lexicon is required.Reviews of products, hotels, and movies are also commonly used for text classification models.

        <p>Table 15 shows the challenges that are explicitly described in the papers. These challenges are categorized and sorted by the number of selected papers that explicitly mention the challenge. Domain dependency is a well-known challenge in sentiment analysis; most of the models that we build are dependent on the domain it was built in. Linguistic dependency is the second most stated and well-known challenge that originates from the same deeper problem. Specific text corpora per domain or language need to be available for the optimal performance of the ML model. Some studies investigate multi-lingual or multi-domain models.Table 15 shows the challenges that are explicitly described in the papers.

        <p>Most papers use English text corpora. Spanish and Chinese are the second most used languages in sentiment analysis. Limited literature is available in other languages. Some studies attempted to create a multi-language model (Al-Moslmi et al. 2017), but this is still a challenging task (Kumar and Garg 2019;Qazi et al. 2017).

        <p>Deep learning is a promising but complex technique where syntactic structures and word order can be retained. Deep learning still poses some challenges and is not widely researched in the selected articles. Opinion spam or fake review detection is a prominent issue in sentiment analysis where the internet has become an integral part of life, and false information spreads just as fast as accurate information on the web (Vosoughi et al. 2018). Another major challenge is the multi-class classification. In general, more output classes in a classifier reduce the performance (Al-Moslmi et al. 2017). Multiple polarity classes and multiple classes of emotions (Madhala et al. 2018) have been shown to dramatically reduce the performance of the model.Deep learning is a promising but complex technique where syntactic structures and word order can be retained.

        <p>The goal of this study is to present an overview of the current application of machine learning models and corresponding challenges in sentiment analysis. This is done by critically analyzing the selected secondary studies and extracting the relevant data considering the predefined research questions. This tertiary study follows the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham and Charters (2007) for conducting systematic literature reviews. The study initially selected 16 secondary studies. After the quality assessment, 14 secondary papers remained for data extraction. The research methodology is transparent and designed in such a way that it can be reproduced by other researchers. Like any secondary study, there are also some limitations to this tertiary study.The goal of this study is to present an overview of the current application of machine learning models and corresponding challenges in sentiment analysis.

        <p>The SLRs included in this study have their specific research focus on sentiment analysis. Even though the methodology of the 14 secondary studies is similar, the documentation of techniques and methods differs a lot. Besides that, some SLR papers are more comprehensive than others. This made the data extraction process harder and prone to mistakes. 1 3The SLRs included in this study have their specific research focus on sentiment analysis.

        <p>Another limitation concerns the selection process. The criteria for inclusion are restricted to SLR and SMS papers. Some other studies chose to include non-systematic literature reviews as well to complement results, but we did not include traditional survey papers because they do not systematically synthesize the papers in a field. The first threat to validity is related to the inclusion criteria for methods in research questions. Checkmarks in the tables of RQ2, RQ3, and RQ4 are placed when something is explicitly mentioned in the referred paper. The included secondary studies have their specific research focus with different sentiment analysis tasks and corresponding machine learning approaches. For instance, Kasmuri and Basiron (2017) discuss subjectivity classification, which typically uses different approaches compared to other sentiment analysis tasks. This variation in research focus influences the checkmarks placed in the tables.Another limitation concerns the selection process. The criteria for inclusion are restricted to SLR and SMS papers.

It is likely that papers with a higher number of included primary articles mention more different techniques and challenges, and thus, more checkmarks are placed in the tables compared to papers with a lower number of primary articles included.Another threat related to inclusion criteria is that some secondary studies have more included papers than others.

        <p>A different number of input and output features could be identified. Interestingly, some features appeared to be described in all the secondary studies, while other features were more specific to a selected set of secondary studies. The results further indicate that sentiment analysis has been applied in various domains, among which social media is the most popular. Also, the study showed that different domains require the use of different techniques.A different number of input and output features could be identified.

        <p>There also seems a trend towards using more complex deep learning techniques, since they can detect more complex patterns in text and perform particularly well with larger datasets. In some use cases like, for example, advertisement, slight improvements in performance that can be obtained through deep learning can have a great impact. However, it should be noted that traditional machine learning models are less computationally expensive and perform sufficiently well for sentiment analysis tasks.

        <p>This study showed that the most prominent challenges in sentiment analysis are domain and language dependency. Specific text corpora are required for differing languages and domains of interest. Attempts for cross-domain and multi-lingual sentiment analysis models have been made, but this challenging task should be explored further. Other prominent challenges are opinion spam detection and the application of deep learning for sentiment analysis tasks. Overall, the study shows that sentiment analysis is a timely and important research topic. The adoption of a tertiary study showed the additional value that could not be derived from each of the secondary studies.This study showed that the most prominent challenges in sentiment analysis are domain and language dependency.

        <p>The following future directions and challenges have also been mainly discussed in deep learning-based survey papers: New datasets are required for more challenging tasks, common sense knowledge must be modeled, interpretable deep learning-based models must be developed, and memory-efficient models are required (Minaee et al. 2020). Domain adaptation techniques are needed, multi-lingual applications should be addressed, technical requirements such as a huge amount of labeled data requirement must be considered, and linguistic complications must be investigated (Do et al. 2019). Popular deep learning techniques such as deep reinforcement learning and generative adversarial networks can be evaluated to solve some challenging tasks, advantages of the BERT algorithm can be considered, language structures (e.g., slangs) can be investigated in detail, dynamic sentiment analysis can be studied, and sentiment analysis for heterogeneous data can be implemented (Habimana et al. 2020a). Dependency trees in recursive neural networks can be investigated, domain adaptation can be analyzed in detail, and linguistic-subjective phenomena (e.g., irony and sarcasm) can be studied (Rojas-Barahona 2016). Different applications of sentiment analysis (e.g., medical domain and security screening of employees) can be implemented, and transfer learning approaches can be analyzed for sentiment classification (Yadav and Vishwakarma 2019). Comparative studies should be extended with new approaches and new datasets, and also hybrid approaches to reduce computational cost and improve performance must be developed (Dang et al. 2020).The following future directions and challenges have also been mainly discussed in deep learning-based survey papers: New datasets are required for more challenging tasks, common sense knowledge must be modeled, interpretable deep learning-based models must be developed, and memory-efficient models are required (Minaee et al. 2020).
