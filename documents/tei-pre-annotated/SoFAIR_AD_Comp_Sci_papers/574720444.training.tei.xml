        <p>This paper reports the development, evaluation and validation of DosiTag, a dosimetric platform based on Near Field Communication (NFC) technology. The designed system comprises two main parts: a passive NFC sensing tag as the dosimeter unit, which includes a commercial P-channel MOSFET transistor as radiation sensor; and an NFC-enabled smartphone running a custom-developed application as the reader unit. Additionally, a cloud service based on the messaging protocol 
            <rs type="software">Message Queue Telemetry Transport (</rs>MQTT) has been implemented using a broker/client architecture to allow the storage and classification of the patient's data. The dosimeter tag was designed using commercial low-power integrated circuits (ICs) and it can operate without any external power supply or battery, being supplied by the smartphone through the radio frequency (RF) energy harvested from the NFC link. The radiation dose is measured through the increase of the DMOS transistor source voltage using the smartphone as the reader unit. Two tag prototypes have been characterized with a 6 MV photon beam and radiation doses up to 57 Gy and 42 Gy, respectively. The achieved average sensitivity is (4.37 ± 0.04) mV/ Gy with a resolution of 2 cGy, which goes beyond the state-of-the-art of previous NFC dosimeters and places DosiTag as a low-cost promising electronic platform for dose control in radiotherapy treatments.
        </p>
        <p>In an effort to improve the quality of the medical use of ionizing radiation, in vivo dosimetry (IVD) emerged as a direct method of measuring the radiation doses received by patients during their radiotherapy sessions. The use of IVD has become more widespread since the World Health Organization (WHO) and other entities considered it an effective way of checking the quality of the entire radiotherapy process [1,2]. Current solutions for such dose measurements are based on detectors like diodes, thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs), metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs), film badges or optically stimulated luminescence dosimeters (OSLDs) [3]. In the case of MOSFETs, the p-type devices generate during irradiation electron-hole pairs proportional to the delivered dose, which can be later read using an appropriate metering system [4]. Their advantages include good linearity, very compact size, immediate readout and easy calibration, thus becoming increasingly popular both commercially [5,6] and in research [7][8][9]. To further improve the sensitivity, transistors with thick gate oxides specially designed for radiation detection have been manufactured, known as RADFETs (Radiation-Sensitive Field Effect Transistors) [10][11][12]. However, for radiation doses used during typical radiotherapy sessions, the possibility of using commercial MOSFETs as dosimeters instead of RADFETs can greatly reduce the cost of the dosimetry system [13]. Nevertheless, achieving such a dosimetry system with commercial MOSFETs [14][15][16][17] requires a reader unit implementing the necessary signal conditioning stages in terms of amplification, filtering and compensation of the temperature effect [7,13,18]. The reader units for these dosimetric systems are usually desktop-based devices [7], which require the use of cables connected to the sensor modules placed on the patient, thus making the process cumbersome and uncomfortable for the patient. To make the system more comfortable for the patient and user-friendly for the healthcare personnel, wireless RFID or NFC-based systems have been proposed [7,[19][20][21]. With this approach, only the NFC dosimetric sensing tag and a smartphone with a custom application are required.</p>
        <p>A smartphone can be currently purchased for a relatively low price and developing a custom smartphone application is feasible with the completely accessible integrated development environments (IDE's) provided by the main mobile software distributors (
            <rs type="software">Android</rs> and 
            <rs type="software">iOS</rs>). Therefore, the implementation of this type of systems is a very costeffective solution with great potential for market access [22]. In addition, if NFC technology [23] is used and the tag's power consumption is sufficiently low, no batteries are required and consequently the cost, maintenance and complexity of the system will greatly decrease. For this reason, several examples of NFC sensing tags can be found in the literature [24][25][26][27]. Since the power consumption of the MOSFET-based dosimeters is usually low , it is possible to implement a battery-less NFC dosimeter.
        </p>
        <p>In this work, we present the development, characterization and validation in hospital facilities of DosiTag, an enhanced NFC-based dosimeter for ionizing radiation with wireless power and communication. The system is composed of a credit-card size NFC tag that incorporates a MOSFET-based sensor module and a smartphone to supply the system and read out the dose measurements. The presented system is an enhanced and redesigned version of a previous NFC-based dosimeter from our research group [7], where a number of novelties and improvements have been implemented. Firstly, the inclusion of a microcontroller unit (MCU) allows the full control of the measurement variables (e.g., measurement time, start/end control, etc.), the possibility to endow the pins with new and diverse functionalities (e.g., turn on/off the sensor module) as well as the use of several Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) modules and the full implementation of bidirectional communication between the microcontroller and the smartphone. Secondly, a new amplification stage has been designed to increase the system resolution. Additionally, the new version allows the irradiation of the complete dosimeter tag, not only the sensor module, and the total irradiation dose has been increased. The new compact design allows the possibility of tag encapsulation, so that the dosimeter tag can be sterilized or submerged in liquids. Regarding the reader unit, a new smartphone app has been developed from scratch and Internet-of-Things (IoT) capabilities have been included thanks to the implementation of a cloud service based on MQTT protocol [30][31][32][33] which allows storage, distribution, and classification of the patient's data.</p>
        <p>For thermal characterization of the radiation sensor, the device was entered into a climatic test chamber VCL4006 (Vötoshch Industrietechnik, Germany) and the electrical characterization was conducted using a custom-developed reader based on 12-bit ADC model MCP3208 (Microchip, Chandler, Arizona, USA). Numerical simulations for the optimization of the tag antenna design were conducted using ADS, i.e., 
            <rs type="software">Advanced Design Simulator</rs> software (
            <rs type="creator">Keysight Technologies</rs>, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The final prototype of the PCB (Printed Circuit Board) was fabricated on 1.5-mm FR-4 substrate. For NFC antenna characterization, the precision impedance analyzer model Agilent 4294 A (Keysight Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA) was employed. 
            <rs type="software">Android Studio</rs>
            <rs type="version">2021.1.1</rs> was the IDE employed to program the custom smartphone application. The app was designed and validated with 
            <rs type="software">Android</rs>
            <rs type="version">10</rs> QKQ1 (API level 29). However, the app supports diverse 
            <rs type="software">Android</rs> versions since the lowest API level supported is 21 (
            <rs type="software">Android</rs>
            <rs type="version">5.0</rs>). The smartphone model used as the NFC reader was the Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 Pro (Xiaomi, Beijing, China).
        </p>
        <p>A Linear Accelerator (LINAC) Siemens Artiste (SiemensAG, Germany) was employed to irradiate two replicas of the prototype based on the commercial p-type MOSFET ZVP3306 (Diode Inc., Plano, TX, USA). The total area of each tag was irradiated in sessions of 3 Gy with a 20 × 20 cm 2 field and 6 MV photon beams. The isocenter of the irradiation source was placed on the zone of the tag where the pMOSFET sensor is located. To measure in electronic equilibrium condition in the sensor, a 1.5-cm thick solid water layer was located on top of the PCBs, and 5 cm thick solid water was placed below it. For this purpose, a 3D-printed holder for the boards was designed and fabricated with PLA using a 3D printer model Creality cr-x (Shenzhen Creality 3D Technology Co., Ltd, Shenzhen, China). With this methodology, a total dose of 57 Gy was irradiated for the first tag and 42 Gy for the second tag.</p>
        <p>To test and evaluate the response of the DosiTag, the obtained results have been compared with our previously developed NFC dosimeter [7] as well as with our desktop dose reader [34] using the same pMOSFET as radiation sensor. As usual in this kind of sensors, to evaluate the increment of the threshold voltage shift, a constant current drain and a diode configuration (drain short-circuited with the gate) were used to measure this increment on the source terminal of the transistor [8,10,[35][36][37][38].</p>
        <p>The functional block diagram of the dosimetric system is depicted in Fig. 1a, including all the functional blocks of the NFC tag; the wireless connection to the smartphone through the NFC link for RF power supply and communication; and the IoT integration by means of the cloud architecture based on the MQTT broker/client protocol. As shown in Fig. 1a, the NFC sensing tag consists of an RFID chip and antenna, an ultra-low power MCU to acquire the measurements, a voltage regulator to provide a regulated voltage reference for the ADC of the microcontroller, a charge pump to double this voltage as supply voltage, a current source, conditioning circuitry, a temperature sensor, an instrumentation amplifier (IA) to increase the resolution of the system, and the radiation sensor module, composed of a pMOSFET and a JFET. The different components of the tag and the IoT integration will be explained in the next subsections. On the other hand, Fig. 1b shows a photograph of the final DosiTag prototype (dimensions of 76 ×40 mm 2 ) with the physical functional blocks.</p>
        <p>The NFC chip M24LR64E (STMicroelectronics, Geneva, Switzerland) along with an ad-hoc designed planar antenna was used as energy harvester to enable the development of battery-less design, data storage, and communication between the MCU and the smartphone [39]. This NFC chip operates in the High Frequency band (HF, 13.56 MHz) and it includes an I 2 C serial communication port. Since this RFID chip does not directly provide a regulated voltage in the energy harvesting mode, a low dropout voltage regulator (LDO) (2.5 V regulator MCP1824T-2502E, Microchip, Chandler, Arizona) was included to supply the system. When correctly coupled to the reader (i.e., the user's smartphone), the NFC chip is able to provide a maximum current that is selectable (300 µA, 1, 3, or 7 mA) according to the harvested electromagnetic (EM) field, which is enough to power the additional circuitry. In the case that the EM field is not sufficient to provide the required power, the chip cuts off the output voltage so that the system does not turn on. This is an advantage in terms of repeatability since the delivered power to the system will be always the same as long as the coils of the tag and the smartphone are correctly overlapped.</p>
        <p>The custom-designed tag antenna is a planar coil based upon the internal capacitance of the M24LR64E NFC chip (Fig. 1b). This antenna has a dual purpose, since it is used to establish bidirectional communication with the smartphone and also to harvest the RF energy to supply the tag. The internal tuning capacitor of the NFC chip has a value of 27.5 pF at 13.56 MHz. Therefore, we require a coil of 5.01 μH to get a parallel LC resonant circuit at the desired HF frequency. The final dimensions and number of turns obtained after numerical simulations were 38 mm × 19 mm and N = 10 turns, being 250 µm both the interspacing between the conductor lines and their width.</p>
        <p>An ultra-low power microcontroller PIC16LF1703 (Microchip, Chandler, Arizona) is used to acquire the measurements from the different sensors, storing the data in the EEPROM memory of the NFC chip through the I 2 C port. The microcontroller uses three ADCs for this task, whose range is the same than the supply voltage range, i.e., from 0 up to 2.5 V. Firstly, after setting the cut off frequency of the Low Pass Filter (LPF) in the amplification stage, the direct pMOSFET source voltage is measured, and subsequently the amplified source voltage is measured. For this purpose, conditioning circuitry was designed to adapt the source voltage of the sensor to the common-mode rejection ratio of an ultra-low power rail-to-rail instrumentation amplifier INA321 (Texas Instruments, Dallas, TX, USA). A Pulse Waveform Modulation (PWM) signal is generated with the Capture/Compare/PWM (CCP) module of the MCU, which is low-pass filtered (see Fig. 1a) to assure a constant voltage, restart the measurement and prevent the output voltage from trespassing the ADC range limits [28]. Finally, since MOSFET threshold voltage is highly temperature-dependent, the temperature sensor MCP9701A (Microchip, Chandler, Arizona) was included in the tag design to monitor the temperature with a resolution of 0.125 • C, which is used for thermal compensation (see Section 3.2).</p>
        <p>The most straightforward way to measure the threshold voltage shift of the transistor is to bias it at constant drain current and to set up the pMOSFET in diode configuration (short-circuiting drain and gate) [36,13,28]. For this purpose, the tag conditioning circuit includes a current source and a buffer to avoid the loading from the conditioning circuitry. The implementation of the current source was conducted using the temperature-compensated circuit LM334 from Texas Instruments (Dallas, TX, USA) using the topology suggested by the manufacturer to reduce the output current thermal drift [7]. The buffer is a general-purpose bipolar transistor BC848C (Infineon AG, Germany), whose role is to prevent the subtraction of the drain current by the emitter resistor and the ADC, and it is also used for thermal drift correction, as shown in the previous work [7]. The selected collector current is dependent on the value of the collector resistor, the source voltage (V s ) and the selected drain current, all of which will be described in the next subsections for the pMOSFET ZVP3306. The output voltage of the conditioning circuit must be between 0 and 2.5 V to accommodate the ADC input voltage range. However, to take advantage of the Common Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR) of the INA321 instrumentation amplifier and to achieve constant gain, the output must lie approximately between 0.8 and 1.5 V. Thus, a reference voltage (V ref ) was included to decrease the voltage value before the ADC input and the V in+ of the IA. In accordance with the conditioning circuitry shown in Fig. 1a, the ADC input voltage and the instrumentation amplifier is given by Eq.</p>
        <p>(1):</p>
        <p>where V S (sensor source voltage), V BE (bipolar transistor base-emitter voltage), and V ref voltages are shown in Fig. 1a. The chosen reference voltage was the model LM385-1.2 from Texas Instruments, which is capable of providing a stable voltage of 1.23 V with a thermal drift of typically 20 ppm/ • C. The major constraint is that the reverse current needs to lie in the range from 10 μA to 20 mA. Considering that the collector voltage of the buffer was around 2.1 V at the selected bias current of the ZVP3306, that is, approximately 0.9 V after the V ref , a 7.5 kΩ collector resistor was included to ensure a reverse current of 120 μA, which lies within the adequate range of this reference voltage.</p>
        <p>On other hand, the instrumentation amplifier INA321 was included to increase the accuracy and resolution of the system. The inverter input (V in-) is controlled by a PWM signal generated by the microcontroller and doubly low-pass filtered to ensure a constant voltage in the input [36,40]. The voltage after the conditioning circuitry is directly measured by the ADC of the microcontroller and is the non-inverter input (V in+ ) of the IA (see Fig. 1a). The signal is amplified by a gain of 45 and measured by other ADC input of the MCU. Thus, the resolution was considerably increased, obtaining 2.44 mV/count in the direct voltage source ADC channel and 0.05 mV/count in the amplified ADC channel (see Fig. 1a). It is worth mentioning that a voltage ripple below 1 mV was obtained at the output of the INA321, which is lower than the accuracy of the ADC, so it does not affect the measurement.</p>
        <p>The energy harvested by the tag antenna is firstly rectified by the NFC chip and then regulated using the voltage regulator. The resulting power is finally used to supply the DC-DC voltage pump, which is based on the ADM660 IC (Analog Devices, USA). This IC was selected because of its low quiescent current of only 600 μA, and because its implementation only requires two external capacitors, thus implying a reduced number of components in the PCB and easier implementation. Thus, the regulated voltage of 2.5 V is augmented up to 5 V in order to achieve a higher maximum value of the drain-to-source voltage. Assuming the ADM660 has the efficiency of a usual DC-DC converter (80 %) and taking into account the quiescent current of 600 μA and the voltage regulator MCP1824T-2502 quiescent current (120 μA), a total power around 3.3 mW must be provided by the M24LR64E IC.</p>
        <p>Finally, to supply the INA321 in the voltage range specified by the manufacturer (2.7-5.5 V), four 1N4148 diodes (Onsemi, Phoenix, Arizona) were used to reduce the voltage from the charge pump down to 3 V. In this way, when the instrumentation amplifier is saturated at high voltage, it does not exceed the input span of the microcontroller ADC.</p>
        <p>The radiation sensor is based on the general-purpose DMOS transistor model ZVP3306, which we had already tested and evaluated with our desk reader unit [40]. The module sensor also includes a P-channel JFET that avoids the potential damage during the storage and irradiation process caused by electrostatic discharge (Fig. 1a) by connecting the drain and source terminals of the pMOSFET. This configuration was validated in the previous NFC-based dosimeter [7] with the J175 JFET (Eindhoven, Netherlands), similar to the sensor module for the desk reader [36], where an N-channel JFET was used. However, for this work the J177 (NXP Semiconductors, Eindhoven, Netherlands) was chosen. In the present work, the gate was directly connected to the charge pump supply voltage, which was sufficient to disconnect the JFET. Finally, during the storage and irradiation period, the voltage in the gate of the JFET is 0 V, so the transistor is ON and prevents the electrostatic discharges in the pMOSFET sensor. Moreover, this sensor module can be controlled by an output pin of the microcontroller to perform several measurements without the need to power the board multiple times.</p>
        <p>The NFC chip M24LR64E-R is compliant with the 
            <rs type="software">Android</rs> NFC-V standard and compatible with the ISO15693 RFID specification. On this basis, the smartphone application was built on the ISO15693 specification and uses specific NFC commands to communicate and control the device. The commands can be executed via RF by the smartphone or via I 2 C by a microcontroller. Fig. 2a,b show some screenshots of the application user interface. Before approaching the smartphone to the 
            <rs type="software">DosiTag</rs>, the user has to fill several fields of personal data related to the patient, as shown in Fig. 2a. Then, the next screen is shown (Fig. 2b), which is composed of text fields that show information such as the tag UID, ambient temperature, date of the measurement, duty cycle of the PWM for the IA, and direct and amplified voltage shift of the pMOSFET source.
        </p>
        <p>The user can now approach the smartphone to the DosiTag to trigger the NFC link. At this point, the system is powered by the EM field harvested from the smartphone and one second later the measurements of the temperature and the direct and amplified source voltage are taken by the microcontroller. 1024 measurements are taken at the maximum sample frequency of the ADC, averaged by the microcontroller and recorded in the NFC EEPROM to be subsequently sent to the smartphone. The delay of one second is necessary for the system to correctly stabilize so that the measurements are always taken at the same time. This is an important issue because an initial decay of the source voltage takes place when a pMOSFET is biased due to the activation of the interface state. We can minimize the effect of this decay by always using the same time during which the pMOSFET is biased prior to conducting the source voltage measurements. The acquired ADC measurements are read and displayed by the smartphone when the user presses the "READ" button. This process must be repeated two times, before and after the irradiation, to calculate the increment of the voltage source. Finally, the source voltage shift is displayed on the screen. Once this process has been completed, the user can publish the final value of the voltage source shift in the MQTT broker to be read by another MQTT client to store and graph each patient's data.</p>
        <p>The fabricated planar coil was characterized over the frequency before and after attaching the NFC chip. In the first case, the obtained inductance value and quality factor (Q) of the coil is shown in Fig. 3a.</p>
        <p>The inductance value at 13.56 MHz is 4.86 μH, which is very close to the desired inductance of 5.01 μH. The achieved quality factor is higher than 50, adequate for an efficient energy harvesting. The LC resonant circuit is completed once the M24LR64E NFC chip is attached to the PCB. Consequently, a new frequency sweep was conducted to measure both the phase and impedance of the resonant circuit. As can be observed in Fig. 3b, the antenna resonates at a frequency of 13.62 MHz, close enough to the designed frequency of 13.56 MHz so that a parallel tuning capacitor was not necessary to adjust the frequency of resonance.</p>
        <p>The designed circuitry for thermal compensation and conditioning is similar to the one shown in our previous NFC dosimeter unit [7] (see Fig. 1a). As in the previous work, to bias the device for reading out and reducing the thermal coefficient of the drain voltage, the BJT collector and pMOSFET drain currents were properly selected. A linear model is assumed for the thermal behavior as already assumed in previous works with good results [7]. Therefore, the thermal voltage drift can be expressed as follows:</p>
        <p>where α is the thermal coefficient of the direct input voltage of the ADC, G • α is the thermal coefficient of the amplified ADC input voltage, α S is the thermal coefficient of the pMOSFET source voltage, and α BE is the linear temperature coefficient of the BJT base-emitter voltage. Since the thermal drift of the voltage reference is small, it can be neglected, so the thermal drift in the ADC voltage is given by the following Eq. ( 3):</p>
        <p>Therefore, if α S and α BE are very close, the thermal coefficient of the input voltage of the ADC is greatly minimized. In a previous work [40], we characterized the thermal drift of the ZVP3306 for multiple currents. With these results, in the previous NFC reader [7] we used a current value of 220 μA for the ZVP3306 in the saturation region with the gate and source short-circuited, and collector current of the buffer of 30 μA to improve the thermal dependence. However, for this DosiTag, it has been necessary to readjust these currents due to the addition of the IA and the MCU. Finally, to improve the thermal dependence, we used a drain current of 190 μA for the ZVP3306 in the saturation region with the gate and source short-circuited, obtaining a thermal coefficient of α S = ( -2.20 ± 0.12)mV/ • C and a collector current for the buffer of 120 μA, so the thermal coefficient was α BE = ( -2.21 ± 0.01)mV/ • C. It should be noted that the temperature dependence of the LM334 current source was measured in the previous work [7] with a 12 kΩ resistor, a resistance that is equivalent to the ZVP3306 at 220 μA. The experiment concluded with a very low thermal drift of 70 nA/ • C.</p>
        <p>To conduct the DosiTag thermal dependence characterization, the tag was powered up using a DC power source at 5 V and it was located inside the climate chamber, where the temperature was swept from 10 up to 50 • C in increments of 5 • C. The source voltage of the pMOSFET transistor (V S ), the amplified source voltage of the pMOSFET transistor (V S_AMP ), and the emitter voltage of the bipolar transistor (V E ) were measured and the corresponding linear temperature coefficients were calculated. The direct thermal coefficient was reduced from α S = ( -1.76 ± 0.33)mV/ • C down to (0.45 ± 0.08)mV/ • C, which is in good agreement with our previous work [7]. If we normalize dividing by the gain the output signal of the IA, the thermal coefficient results in α = (0.32 ± 0.05)mV/ • C, which is considerably lower than the direct thermal coefficient of the previous NFC dosimeter. The reduction of the thermal coefficient in the amplified channel is mainly due to the IA having a negative thermal dependence. Finally, a reduction of 75 % in the direct thermal coefficient and 82% in the amplified normalized thermal coefficient was obtained.</p>
        <p>Two replicas of the developed DosiTag system were irradiated using the experimental setup described in Section 2.1.2. The first one was used to check the durability and the resistance of the electronics against the ionizing radiation, and only measured the direct source voltage of the pMOSFET. It was experimentally checked that the system was still working properly after an irradiated dose of 57 Gy. In the second prototype, the instrumentation amplifier was employed to improve the accuracy and the resolution of the dosimeter. In both cases, the source voltage was measured three minutes after each irradiation to minimize short-term fading effect. Therefore, this DosiTag has been designed in order to have one channel with lower resolution for the measurement of high doses (e.g., 10 Gy) and a channel with much higher resolution for the measurement of low doses (e.g., 3 Gy) so that the increase of the amplified source voltage does not exceed 0.7 V (see Section 2.2.4) as this is the range where the ADC and IA operate with higher linearity. As shown in Fig. 4, very good linearity was obtained in the increase of both the direct and amplified normalized source voltage as a function of the received dose.</p>
        <p>The obtained average sensitivity of the low-resolution channel (LRC) of the DosiTag unit was (4.35 ± 0.17) mV/Gy, while the sensitivity of the high-resolution channel (HRC) was (4.37 ± 0.04) mV/Gy with a resolution of 79 cGy and 2 cGy, respectively. The achieved results are in good agreement with the average sensitivity measured in previous studies of the DMOS transistor ZVP3306 [13,41] including the previous NFC dosimeter [7], which was (4.75 ± 0.15) mV/Gy with a resolution of 17 cGy. This means that we have achieved an improvement of the resolution by a factor of 8. Finally, it should be noted that each sample plotted on the Fig. 4 is the mean of three measurements taken after each irradiation.</p>
        <p>Source voltage recovery after irradiation was studied using a new sample of the system. This prototype was irradiated in three batches of 3 Gy, and after the last irradiation, the source voltage was measured every 10 min for two hours. According to Fig. 5, the source voltage decays with an average slope of (-6.3 ± 0.4) µV/min, which is in agreement with a previous study [42]. This recovery implies a dose underestimation of (-1.62 ± 0.06) mGy/min. Therefore, the error due to source voltage recovery can be considered negligible if the measurement is performed in the first 10 min after irradiation.</p>
        <p>To evaluate the response of the DosiTag at low doses and to determine the system resolution, a set of 4 irradiation sessions of 50 mGy was performed. A thermal correction was applied using the thermal coefficient obtained in Section 3.2 and the temperature measured with the temperature sensor included in the prototype. In the last session (0.2 Gy in Fig. 6), the DosiTag was cooled by 1.7 • C before irradiation to study the thermal correction during irradiation. The obtained results are shown in Fig. 6, where thermal correction reduced the error due to the thermal shift in the last irradiation session, thus allowing the system to detect irradiation doses of 5 cGy.</p>
        <p>As previously stated, DosiTag is an enhanced design of an earlier version of NFC dosimeter developed in our research group [7]. As a summary, Table 1 shows the main improvements and/or novelties of DosiTag system compared to the previous version. Apart from these advantages, the system also presents some limitations that deserves a mention. In particular, the inclusion of the amplification stage entails the inconvenience of the establishment time of the low pass filter for fixing the inverting input to the desired voltage. Therefore, the system must wait a minimum of one second before making the measurement. On the other hand, a correct alignment between the tag and the smartphone coils is required so that enough energy is harvested to power the system up. This means that the smartphone must be held in the correct position (i.e., correctly aligned with the tag and at a short distance) for at least one second while it is placed on the patient.</p>
        <p>A battery-less and wireless dosimetric system composed of an NFC tag with a pMOSFET-based dosimeter, a smartphone as the reader unit, and a cloud service based on MQTT protocol has been developed and evaluated in hospital facilities with potential application in dosimetry control of radiotherapy treatments. This DosiTag system is based on a previous NFC dosimeter that has been redesigned and improved in several aspects. In particular, the system resolution has been improved by a factor of 8 thanks to the use of an instrumentation amplifier. Moreover, the thermal drift has been further reduced using a commercial bipolar buffer, obtaining a reduction of the thermal coefficient by 82 %. The measurement process, data storage and cloud publication are conducted through a custom-developed smartphone application. The inclusion of the MQTT broker to upload the measured data enables the classification of the dosimetry data and the identification of the NFC reader unit used for each patient, thus allowing a personalized follow-up and individual control of the patients. The integration of the sensor module on the PCB allows the board to be encapsulated and sterilized. The dosimetric characterization was conducted using a LINAC in hospital facilities, obtaining a sensitivity of (4.35 ± 0.17) mV/Gy for the low resolution channel and (4.37 ± 0.04) mV/Gy for the high resolution channel. The resolution of the LRC and HRC was 79 cGy and 2 cGy. The results are in good agreement with previous works and the system is still accurate after high radiation doses despite the entire area of the tag is irradiated. In conclusion, the achieved improved features of the developed DosiTag system support its potential use for clinical dose measurement in radiotherapy treatments.</p>
