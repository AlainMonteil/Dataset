        <p>Here we show that higher-order interactions between coupled phase oscillators, encoded microscopically in a simplicial complex, give rise to added nonlinearity in the macroscopic system dynamics that induces abrupt synchronization transitions via hysteresis and bistability of synchronized and incoherent states. Moreover, these higher-order interactions can stabilize strongly synchronized states even when the pairwise coupling is repulsive. These findings reveal a self-organized phenomenon that may be responsible for the rapid switching to synchronization in many biological and other systems that exhibit synchronization without the need of particular correlation mechanisms between the oscillators and the topological structure.Here we show that higher-order interactions between coupled phase oscillators, encoded microscopically in a simplicial complex, give rise to added nonlinearity in the macroscopic system dynamics that induces abrupt synchronization transitions via hysteresis and bistability of synchronized and incoherent states.

        <p>T he collective dynamics of network-coupled dynamical systems has been a major subject of research in the physics community during the last decades [1][2][3][4] due to a wide range of applications including cardiac rhythms 5 , power grid dynamics 6 , and proper cell circuit behavior 7 . In particular, our understanding of both natural and man-made systems has significantly improved by studying how network structures and dynamical processes combine to shape overall system behaviors. This interplay gives rise to nonlinear phenomena like switch-like abrupt transitions to synchronization [8][9][10] and cluster states 11,12 . Recent work in physics and neuroscience have specifically highlighted the importance of higher order interactions between dynamical units, i.e., three-and four-way interactions in addition to pairwise interactions, and their role in shaping collective behavior [13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20] , prompting the network science community to turn its attention to higher order structures to better represent the kinds of interactions that one can find beyond typical pairwise interactions [21][22][23] . These higher order interactions are often encoded in simplicial complexes 24 that describe the different kinds of simplex structure present in the network: a filled clique of m + 1 nodes is known as an m-simplex, and together a set of 1-simplexes (links), 2-simplexes (filled triangles), etc. comprise the simplicial complex. While simplicial complexes have been proven to be very useful for analysis and computation in high dimensional data sets, e.g., using persistent homologies 17 , little is understood about their role in shaping dynamical processes, save for a handful of examples [25][26][27][28][29] .T he collective dynamics of network-coupled dynamical systems has been a major subject of research in the physics community during the last decades [1][2][3][4] due to a wide range of applications including cardiac rhythms 5 , power grid dynamics 6 , and proper cell circuit behavior 7 .

        <p>In parallel to the previous developments, there has been also a lot of attention on another phenomena related to the collective dynamics of network-coupled oscillators namely the explosive synchronization phenomenon, see 10 and references therein. Explosive synchronization consists of an abrupt switch between incoherent and synchronized states, that can be achieved by the interplay between the network structure and the oscillators dynamics, being the most simple prescription that of each oscillator having a natural frequency proportional to the number of connections in the network. This mathematical finding is becoming particularly important in neuroscience, where bistability and fast switching of states are very relevant to understand, bistable perception 30 , epileptic seizures in the brain 31,32 , or hypersensitivity in chronic pain of Fibromyalgia patients 33 . However, the mechanisms for this abrupt switching to happen are still unclear. The specificities of the networks should not be the most relevant parameter, given that human wiring is not equivalent between individuals 34 , and then we rely on another aspect, the higher order (beyond pairwise) interactions in the network. In previous work investigating the effects of 2-simplex coupling we showed that such interactions suffice to give rise to abrupt desynchronization transitions 9 . The collective dynamics of sources and loads in large-scale power grids provides another important application where abrupt synchronization transitions play an important role 35 .In parallel to the previous developments, there has been also a lot of attention on another phenomena related to the collective dynamics of network-coupled oscillators namely the explosive synchronization phenomenon, see 10 and references therein.

        <p>Here we study the dynamics of heterogeneous phase oscillators with higher order interactions on simplicial complexes with 1-, 2-, and 3-simplex interactions. Specifically, we aim to understand the effect of higher order interactions that combine simplex interactions of multiple orders in the emergence of synchronization. In contrast to our previous work in 9 , where we demonstrated that 2-simplex interactions alone did not lead to any synchronization transition (i.e., they do not destabilize the incoherent state), here we show that the combination of multiple higher order interactions gives rise to both abrupt synchronization and desynchronization transitions, allowing the system to easily switch between incoherent and synchronized states with relatively small changes to system parameters. We use the celebrated Kuramoto model 36 to scrutinize the higher order dynamics in complex networks. Previous studies already revealed a rich phase diagram where nonpairwise interactions are considered, showing multi-stability 37 , quasiperiodicity 38 , and even chaos 39 . Our contribution aligns with these previous works and demonstrates that higher order interactions provide a natural mechanism for the emergence of explosive synchronization.Here we study the dynamics of heterogeneous phase oscillators with higher order interactions on simplicial complexes with 1-, 2-, and 3-simplex interactions.

        <p>The results presented above illustrate two critical findings using a real brain dataset. First, the presence of higher order interactions, i.e., 2-and 3-simplexes, can induce abrupt synchronization transitions without any additional dynamical or structural ingredients. Incoherent and synchronized states have been mapped to resting and active states of the brain 43 , respectively, with abrupt transitions representing quick and efficient mechanisms for switching cognitive tasks. However, previous work has shown that in the presence of only 1-simplex coupling, properties such as time delays 44 or degree-frequency correlations 8 are needed to induce such transitions. Second, the presence of higher order interactions can create and stabilize a synchronized state even when 1-simplex coupling is negative, i.e., repulsive. Thus, higher order interactions nonlinear effects that support synchronization on the macroscopic scale. To emphasize the broader implications of this finding, we plot in Fig. 1(d) the synchronization profile of the order parameter r vs 1-simplex coupling K 1 (again both increasing and decreasing K 1 to highlight the explosive transitions and bistability) for higher order coupling strengths K 2 = 2.2 and K 3 = 3.3 on the UK power grid network 6 . Here, since the network is strongly geometric and adjacent nodes are geographically close to one another, and therefore likely similarly affected by local events, we identify 2-simplexes as 3-paths (i.e., paths of three connected nodes, a.k.a., wedges) and 3-simplexes as 4-paths and 4-stars (i.e., three nodes all connected to a fourth central node). The qualitatively similar behavior displayed here demonstrates a wide range of important synchronization applications where higher order interactions may significantly affect the dynamics.The results presented above illustrate two critical findings using a real brain dataset.

We now show that the all-to-all case illustrates, in an analytically tractable setting, all the dynamical phenomena observed in the Macaque example (see Fig. 1). First, in Fig. 2a we plot steady-state solutions of the order parameter r as a function of the 1-simplex coupling strength K 1 for a variety of higher order coupling strengths K 2+3 = 0, 2, 5, 8, and 10 (blue to red). Analytical predictions given by Eq. ( 5) are plotted as solid and dashed curves (for stable and unstable branches, respectively), and circles represent results from direct simulation of Eq. ( 1) with N = 10 4 oscillators. For sufficiently small higher order coupling (e.g., K 2+3 = 0) the transition to synchronization is second-order, occurring via a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. However, as K 2+3 is increased through a critical value of K sync 1 ¼ 2 the synchronized branch folds over itself, giving rise to hysteresis and abrupt transitions between incoherence and synchronization for larger values of higher order coupling (e.g., K 2+3 = 5, 8, and 10). In this regime the pitchfork bifurcation at K , where the synchronized branch first appears. These two bifurcations correspond to the abrupt transitions observed in Fig. 1. We also observe that for K 2+3 ≥ 8 the synchronized branch stretches into the negative region K 1 &lt; 0 (e.g., K 2+3 = 10), again demonstrating that higher order interactions can stabilize synchronized states even when pairwise interactions are repulsive.

In particular, aiming for such a multiplex with mean degrees 〈k 1 〉, 〈k 2 〉, and 〈k 3 〉, we construct each layer randomly, placing M 1 = N〈k 1 〉/2 1-simplexes (i.e., links) in the first layer, M 2 = N〈k 2 〉/3 2-simplexes (i.e., filled triangles) in the second layer, and M 3 = N〈k 3 〉/4 3-simplexes (i.e., filled tetrahedra) in the third layer. (Note that the first layer is a classical Erdős-Rényi network 46 and the second and third layers are the generic extensions using 2-and 3-simplexes instead of typical links.) In Fig. 3a,b we plot the the order parameter r vs 1-simplex coupling K 1 and higher order coupling K 2+3 , respectively, for a multiplex network of N = 10 4 oscillators with mean degrees 〈k 1 〉 = 〈k 2 〉 = 〈k 3 〉 = 30 in circles. Similar to Figs. 2(a) and (b), solid and dashed curves represent the analytical results for the mean-field approximation from the all-to-all case. These results illustrate that the mean-field approximation accurately describes the dynamics of such randomly generated simplicial complexes.Having demonstrated the synchronization dynamics that arise from higher order interactions in simplicial complexes in a real brain dataset and the all-to-all scenario, we lastly turn to a synthetic network example, constructing a simplicial complex via a three-layer multiplex, where the qth layer consists of qsimplexes. In particular, aiming for such a multiplex with mean degrees 〈k 1 〉, 〈k 2 〉, and 〈k 3 〉, we construct each layer randomly, placing M 1 = N〈k 1 〉/2 1-simplexes (i.e., links) in the first layer, M 2 = N〈k 2 〉/3 2-simplexes (i.e., filled triangles) in the second layer, and M 3 = N〈k 3 〉/4 3-simplexes (i.e., filled tetrahedra) in the third layer. (Note that the first layer is a classical Erdős-Rényi network 46 and the second and third layers are the generic extensions using 2-and 3-simplexes instead of typical links.) In Fig. 3a,b we plot the the order parameter r vs 1-simplex coupling K 1 and higher order coupling K 2+3 , respectively, for a multiplex network of N = 10 4 oscillators with mean degrees 〈k 1 〉 = 〈k 2 〉 = 〈k 3 〉 = 30 in circles.

        <p>The results presented above demonstrate that higher order interactions in networks of coupled oscillators, which are encoded on the microscopic scale of by a simplicial complex, give rise to added nonlinearities in the macroscopic system dynamics. These nonlinearities give rise to two important phenomena that are not present in the absence of higher order interactions, i.e., when interactions are solely pairwise. First, these nonlinearities induce Fig. 2 Abrupt synchronization in simplicial complexes: All-to-all case. Synchronization profiles describing the macroscopic system state: (a) the order parameter r as a function of 1-simplex coupling K 1 for higher order coupling K 2+3 = 0, 2, 5, 8, and 10 (blue to red) and (b) the order parameter r as a function of higher order coupling K 2+3 for 1-simplex coupling K 1 = -0.5, 1, 1.8, 2, and 2.2.

For K 2+3 &lt; 2 and K 2+3 &gt; 2 the pitchfork bifurcation is supercritical and subcritical, respectively. abrupt transitions between incoherent and synchronized states without additional characteristics such as time delays or networkdynamics correlations. In the context of brain dynamics, incoherent and synchronized states correspond to resting and active states, with abrupt transitions facilitating efficient switching between cognitive tasks 43 . Second, when nonlinearities are sufficiently strong they create and stabilize synchronized states even when pairwise coupling is repulsive. Thus, even as certain kinds of coupling may degrade over time due to synaptic plasticity, the presence of other kinds of coupling may be enough to sustain bistability regimes between incoherence and synchronization. We note that in this paper we have taken brain dynamics as our primary motivating example due to the existence of direct evidence of higher order interactions in a system with synchronization properties 13,14,16,19 . However, more general results suggest that higher order interactions may be important in broader classes of physical systems 15,20 including large-scale power grids 47 , indicating that the nonlinear phenomena observed in this context may point to other nonlinear behaviors that arise from such interactions in different contexts.The results presented above demonstrate that higher order interactions in networks of coupled oscillators, which are encoded on the microscopic scale of by a simplicial complex, give rise to added nonlinearities in the macroscopic system dynamics.
