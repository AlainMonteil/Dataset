        <p>Online education is a hot topic that is widely concerned in various countries today. In the era of mobile internet, countries around the world have made various effective attempts at online education, but online education is more of a supplement to school education, and largescale normal online education lacks cases. The "School's Out, But Class's On" campaign launched by the Chinese government during the COVID-19 epidemic created a large-scale, normal online education application. We analyzed the background of this large-scale online education, clarify the foundation of large-scale online education, and reveal the impact of the largest online education activities on society and education.Online education is a hot topic that is widely concerned in various countries today.

        <p>The outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, was a major public health emergency that had the fastest spread, the widest scope of infection, and the most difficult to prevent and control in China since its establishment (Xinhuanet, 2020). Affected by the epidemic, the government requires departments at all levels to organize forces to limit or stop crowd gathering, and requires non-essential enterprises to suspend production and business operations, and normal economic and social activities were greatly affected (Guangming.com, 2020). The World Health Organization-China Joint Expert Expedition calls the powerful public health measures China has taken in response to the COVID-19 epidemic, which may be "the most ambitious, flexible and active disease control in human history" (People's Network, 2020).The outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, was a major public health emergency that had the fastest spread, the widest scope of infection, and the most difficult to prevent and control in China since its establishment (Xinhuanet, 2020).

        <p>While blocking the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic to schools, in order to reduce the impact of the epidemic on education, since February 4, 2020, the Leading Group of the Ministry of Education of China to respond to the COVID-19 epidemic has issued the "About Guiding Opinions on Online Teaching Organization and Management of General Colleges and Universities during the Period, Notice on Supporting Education and Teaching with Information Technology during Epidemic Prevention and Control, and Several Suggestions on Targeted Teacher Work during Epidemic Prevention and Control Notice". It is proposed here that during the COVID-19 epidemic, schools use internet platforms to guide students to realize "School's Out, But Class's On", i.e., "School is closed, but student learning is continuing online" or "Online Home Study" (This refers to the Official Website of the Chinese Ministry of Education: http://en.moe.gov.cn/).While blocking the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic to schools, in order to reduce the impact of the epidemic on education, since February 4, 2020, the Leading Group of the Ministry of Education of China to respond to the COVID-19 epidemic has issued the "About Guiding Opinions on Online Teaching Organization and Management of General Colleges and Universities during the Period, Notice on Supporting Education and Teaching with Information Technology during Epidemic Prevention and Control, and Several Suggestions on Targeted Teacher Work during Epidemic Prevention and Control Notice".

        <p>Although the Chinese government's decision is an education measure that must be taken as a last resort, the activity itself has had a profound impact. According to the official data of the Ministry of Education in 2019, China has 270 million students at all levels and nearly 20 million faculty members at all levels (Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, 2019). So many teachers and students carry out educational activities through the Internet for a period of more than six weeks, which is a great initiative of online education in the world. Based on the implementation status of "School's Out, But Class's On", we are trying to summarize the reasons for the smooth development of large-scale online education activities based on the development results of modern education in China. The effective implementation of the preface provides reference and inspiration.Although the Chinese government's decision is an education measure that must be taken as a last resort, the activity itself has had a profound impact.

        <p>China's education informatization exploration initially participated in the education and teaching reform in the form of "electronic education". In 1978, the Ministry of Education issued the "Preliminary Plan on E-education Work" (discussion draft), which is the first time to deploy education informatization at the national level (Hu, 2019). Subsequently, the Ministry of Education successively introduced such strategic plans as the "National Ninth Five-Year Plan" for electrification education, the "Action Plan for the Revitalization of Education for the 21st Century", and the "Tenth Five-Year Development Plan (Outline) for Education Informatization". This means that China is progressing from the initial stage to the rapid development stage (Zhong, et al., 2017).China's education informatization exploration initially participated in the education and teaching reform in the form of "electronic education".

However, since the emergence of online learning in 2013, online learning has not become one of the popular teaching formats in China (Wang, 2019). The successful launch of this large-scale online education activity provided valuable experience for the further implementation of online education, enriched people's understanding of online education, and increased the stickiness between educational technology and education and teaching. It is foreseeable that after the normal start of school, the use of the Internet for autonomous learning and after-school supplementary learning will become an important way for students to learn. Online teaching through the Internet will become an important form of teacher teaching, and teaching management using the Internet will also become an important form of school management.</p>
        <p>The implementation of this large-scale online education objectively proves the effectiveness of China's education reform. The implementation of "School's Out, But Class's On" made all the people who are connected with education and rely on determination and inertia to stop at the old track (Wang, 2020). It changes the teaching environment under normal conditions, allowing teaching activities to move from offline to online, teacher's teaching from face-to-face to online cloud teaching, and student's learning from classroom listening to home-based autonomous learning. "School's Out, But Class's On" has completely changed the learning methods of students and the teaching methods of teachers, and has overturned the traditional teacher-centered teaching model in traditional teaching. "School's Out, But Class's On" is not simply transplanting normal classroom teaching or offline education scenarios to the Internet platform. Its essence is a largescale and far-reaching education and teaching practice in China. Online education is a combination of modern education technology, education concepts and traditional education to form a new model suitable for educational needs (Ji &amp; Sun, 2019). In order to ensure the quality and effectiveness of online teaching, it is not only necessary to change the form of learning and teaching, but also to redesign the online teaching model (Wang, 2020). In the teaching process, taking the student as the center and the goal of promoting student development, teachers should select the corresponding digital education resources according to the nature of the discipline and the needs of student development, appropriately intervene and regulate the student's learning process, and rationally design and use learning activities to guide students to learn independently.The implementation of this large-scale online education objectively proves the effectiveness of China's education reform.

        <p>Therefore, the large-scale online education activities under the background of "School's Out, But Class's On" have stimulated the exploration of online teaching models and promoted the reconstruction of ecological teaching models. For students, online education promotes the transformation of learning models. Students have a more autonomous and personalized learning experience, allowing students to grasp the learning progress and choose the learning environment according to their own knowledge and ability level. For teachers, there is a need to rebuild the curriculum structure, improve teaching methods, and diversify classes. For schools, the new technology makes teaching management more effective, and also blurs the school's geographical boundaries, changes the structure of the school's curriculum, and makes it have the characteristics of "lead teacher + teaching assistants + technical staff".Therefore, the large-scale online education activities under the background of "School's Out, But Class's On" have stimulated the exploration of online teaching models and promoted the reconstruction of ecological teaching models.

        <p>Affected by the epidemic, during the "School's Out, But Class's On" period, the teacher-student relationship and parent-child relationship encountered the modern dilemma with discrete time and space. Students cannot go to school to receive teacher guidance. In order to cooperate with their children's autonomous learning, many parents have supervised their children to study instead of teachers. Parents became important partners of students' autonomous learning during this special period. In this process, the relationship between parents and teachers was closer, and school education and family education were further integrated. "School's Out, But Class's On" really opened the way for family-school co-education.Affected by the epidemic, during the "School's Out, But Class's On" period, the teacher-student relationship and parent-child relationship encountered the modern dilemma with discrete time and space.

        <p>Online learning during "School's Out, But Class's On" is not only an academic education, but also a "life education, belief education, science education, moral education" (Zheng, 2020). During the growth of students, 'School's Out, But Class's On' is not eager to master new knowledge of subjects in online courses, nor is it eager to take the opportunity to "overtake the peers", but to comprehensively improve the quality education of students to meet Students need to grow. At this stage, schools strengthen home-school ties, guide parents to establish a scientific concept of child rearing, learn scientific child rearing methods, and establish harmonious family relationships. Through home-school collaborative management, guide students to learn self-planning, independent learning, and self-management to achieve more valuable autonomous growth (Yu, 2020)."Online learning during "School's Out, But Class's On" is not only an academic education, but also a "life education, belief education, science education, moral education" (Zheng, 2020).

        <p>Schools and families are indispensable subjects in the healthy growth of children. Building a harmonious home-school relationship and forming a pattern of cooperative education can guarantee children's healthy growth (People's Daily, 2019). The implementation of "School's Out, But Class's On" has provided more time and space for teacher-student relations and parent-child relationships, and has closer links between schools, families and students. This really promotes the integration of home education and school education, creates a good environment for students to learn independently, and promotes students to achieve more valuable growth.Schools and families are indispensable subjects in the healthy growth of children.

        <p>In this sudden epidemic, the implementation of "School 's Out, But Class 's On" enabled 270 million students in China to learn online. Many places and schools across the country actively use the "cloud" technology to independently choose online live classrooms, online on-demand teaching, TV video learning and other methods for online teaching. Make full use of relevant national, local, and school-related teaching resources to provide online learning with rich, diverse, selectable, and high-quality online teaching resources covering all regions.In this sudden epidemic, the implementation of "School 's Out, But Class 's On" enabled 270 million students in China to learn online.

        <p>Such a large-scale, established system of online teaching activities is a test of China's education system facing major emergencies. The test results prove that China has basically completed the infrastructure of the Internet through the construction of informatization and education informatization in the past three decades. This provided the basic technical guarantee and resource guarantee for this large-scale online education. At the same time, through continuous deepening of education reforms, education and teaching concepts have been improved, and a "student-centric" education model has been basically established, creating possibilities for the occurrence of this online learning. Through the implementation of "School's Out, But Class's On", it has provided valuable experience for accelerating the integration of technology and education and for reforming the teaching methods of education in the new situation.Such a large-scale, established system of online teaching activities is a test of China's education system facing major emergencies.

        <p>However, in the implementation process, online teaching also reflects some problems. For example, in online teaching, some teachers copy classroom teaching content to online teaching courses, ignoring subjective guidance, lacking teacher-student interaction, and poor teaching results. At the same time, some students, due to lack of self-control and self-learning ability, lacked face-to-face teacher or even parental supervision, online learning became a form, and the autonomous learning effect was not satisfactory.
