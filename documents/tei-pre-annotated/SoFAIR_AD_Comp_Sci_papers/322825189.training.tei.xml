        <p>With the exponential growth in the mobile device market over the last decade, chatbots are becoming an increasingly popular option to interact with users, and their popularity and adoption are rapidly spreading. These mobile devices change the way we communicate and allow everpresent learning in various environments. This study examined educational chatbots for Facebook Messenger to support learning. The independent web directory was screened to assess chatbots for this study resulting in the identification of 89 unique chatbots. Each chatbot was classified by language, subject matter and developer's platform. Finally, we evaluated 47 educational chatbots using the Facebook Messenger platform based on the analytic hierarchy process against the quality attributes of teaching, humanity, affect, and accessibility. We found that educational chatbots on the Facebook Messenger platform vary from the basic level of sending personalized messages to recommending learning content. Results show that chatbots which are part of the instant messaging application are still in its early stages to become artificial intelligence teaching assistants. The findings provide tips for teachers to integrate chatbots into classroom practice and advice what types of chatbots they can try out.With the exponential growth in the mobile device market over the last decade, chatbots are becoming an increasingly popular option to interact with users, and their popularity and adoption are rapidly spreading.

        <p>A chatbot is a software tool that interacts with users on a certain topic or in a specific domain in a natural, conversational way using text and voice. For many different purposes, chatbots have been used across a wide range of domains, including marketing, customer service, technical support, as well as education and training. Current developments in this area suggest that interaction with technologies, either by natural language or by speech, is possible because technology develops, and users become more used to interacting with digital entities. Rather than creating a human-like smart machine application, it is about creating effective digital assistants who are able to provide information, answer questions, discuss a specific topic, or perform a task.A chatbot is a software tool that interacts with users on a certain topic or in a specific domain in a natural, conversational way using text and voice.

        <p>Personal digital assistants like Siri from Apple, Alexa from Amazon, Microsoft's Cortana or Assistant from Google are at the forefront of technology of voice recognition and artificial intelligence. These digital assistants use machine-learning techniques and are able to manage some day-to-day tasks of traditional assistants or secretaries (such as email prioritization, highlighting the most important content and interactions) to help their users become more effective. A vast number of simpler and more domain-specific text-based chatbots complement target-specific functionalities such as raising support tickets to leave feedback, disseminating content for publishing sites, booking a hotel room, making a restaurant reservation, etc. Text-based chatbots typically follow a set of established rules or flows to respond to questions posted by a user (Budiu, 2018) Social media and networking service Facebook opened up its Messenger platform to let chatbots into the application in April 2016. Since then, the Facebook Messenger platform has over 1.3 billion monthly users (Constine, 2018), accounts with over 300,000 chatbots, as well as businesses and customers that exchange 8 billion messages a day (Johnson, 2018). The major advantage of using a Facebook Messenger chatbot is a low barrier to entry for the creator and his target audience. 
            <rs type="software">Facebook Messenger</rs> is the third most-used mobile application in the world, used by 68 percent of users (Hartmans, 2017). Benefits for the users are using a familiar interface, no need to download and install extra application, 24/7 availability. Drawback includes interference from other conversations in the instant messaging application (Pereira &amp; Dı ́az, 2018). There are several advantages for the chatbot creator: using the existing infrastructure of social platform, personalization of the conversation, presence on mobile and web. Chatbots can be developed in any programming language or use a third-party no-code platform that uses a visual development environment. Issues with chatbots are that users are not familiar with a chatbot experience, poor mechanisms for discoverability and limitations based on policy and usage guidelines.

        <p>Compared with applications stores like Apple's App Store, Microsoft Store or Google Play there is no single space where users can filter or discover educational chatbots. If we want to find a chatbot directly on the Facebook Messenger, we need to search the name of the brand or chatbot in the search bar. However, users would rather look for a specific service than the exact name or brand. There are independent web directories like Chatbottle (chatbottle.co) or Botlist (botlist.co) that find bots. Botlist directories list chatbots from various platforms (e.g. Amazon Echo, 
            <rs type="software">Skype</rs>, Slack, and others), with over 2000 Messenger chatbots in 29 categories.
        </p>
        <p>Screening and assessment of chatbots for study inclusion were guided by a systematic review process and restricted to the Botlist directory (Fig. 1). The directory was inventoried during the period of March-April 2018, resulting in the identification of 121 total chatbots (N ¼ 121). Chatbots meeting the following inclusion criteria were analyzed further: (a) education category, (b) available to the public, (c) chatbot for Facebook Messenger. However, 32 bots were found inactive or not available, resulting in 89 unique chatbots (N ¼ 89).Screening and assessment of chatbots for study inclusion were guided by a systematic review process and restricted to the Botlist directory (Fig. 1).

        <p>A coding instrument was developed to identify chatbots in the following categories: language, subject matter, and platform (Table 1). Each chatbot was first classified by Language, in which the bot communicated with the user. The majority of the chatbots used English as a communication language (89%). Other languages included French (N ¼ 8, 9%) and Arabic (N ¼ 7, 8%). Altogether, 11 languages were identified through conversation with the chatbots, with a group of chatbots being designed to communicate with more than one language (N ¼ 9, 10%). Each chatbot was then classified by Subject matter. Within this classification, twelve areas were identified. The majority of the bots were classified as "Information" (N ¼ 42, 47%), and their educational content was questionable. These chatbots often only use automated answers or button-based browsing, which lead to website links outside the chatbot interface, and lack any discussion techniques or simulation of the human conversation. Therefore only chatbots classified as Language, Economics, Math, Multiple subject matter, Religion, Literature, History, Nature, Programming, Psychology, or Design will be used (N ¼ 47, 53%) for the evaluation of their quality. Finally, each chatbot was classified by Platform. There are two options on how to create a chatbot on Facebook Messenger platform: with coding using the Messenger Platform and sets of APIs, or without coding using chatbot building tools that offer the ability to set up a chatbot and connect it to a Facebook Page. Over 55% of the chatbots used a platform Multiple subject matter which could not be identified from the user's perception. However, the Chatfuel service was identified as the most common platform (N ¼ 36, 40%) used between building tools.A coding instrument was developed to identify chatbots in the following categories: language, subject matter, and platform (Table 1).

        <p>In general, when having a conversation with a chatbot, users expect that chatbots will be able to answer questions and process orders, whilst also allowing for the automation of certain types of routine, repetitive, time-consuming communication. Interactions with a chatbot in Messenger tend to be more natural than with a mobile application or a website. People tend to ask the question they have in mind and expect to get an answer. Yet Weinberg (Weinberg, 2017) reports Facebook has seen 70% of its chatbot interactions fail, meaning that the artificial intelligence could not understand what users were saying and humans had to step in, according to a news report.In general, when having a conversation with a chatbot, users expect that chatbots will be able to answer questions and process orders, whilst also allowing for the automation of certain types of routine, repetitive, time-consuming communication.

        <p>Radziwill and Benton (Radziwill &amp; Benton, 2017) proposed a quality assessment method for evaluating the quality of chatbots and intelligent conversational agents. Based on literature reviews of quality issues and attributes, they recommend a method based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). This approach is suitable for solving multicriteria decision-making problems. Radziwill and Benton summarized the quality attributes from previous studies as a checklist for chatbot analysis. The quality attributes include the effectiveness (functionality, humanity), efficiency (performance), and satisfaction (accessibility, affect, behavior and ethics).Radziwill and Benton (Radziwill &amp; Benton, 2017) proposed a quality assessment method for evaluating the quality of chatbots and intelligent conversational agents.

        <p>For our study, we used this checklist to limit the subjective factor of the decision-maker.

        <p>The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a structured technique for organizing and analyzing complex decisions that involve both qualitative and quantitative considerations. The AHP is a group decision-making method originally developed by prof. Thomas L. Saaty (Saaty, The Analytic Hierarchy Process, Saaty, 1980). It is a method for ranking and prioritizing alternatives where it is necessary to consider multiple criteria (Saaty, Relative measurement and its generalization in decision making why pairwise comparisons are central in mathematics for the measurement of intangible factors the analytic hierarchy/network process, Saaty, 2008). Firstly, one decomposes their decision problem into a hierarchy of quality attributes and select metrics. Secondly, the decision makers evaluate various elements by comparing them to each other two at a time, with respect to their impact on an element above them in the hierarchy. Finally, numerical priorities are calculated for each of the decision alternatives to determine which option best satisfies the hierarchy of quality attributes.The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a structured technique for organizing and analyzing complex decisions that involve both qualitative and quantitative considerations.

        <p>The Analytic Hierarchy Process (Saaty, How to make a decision: The analytic hierarchy process, Saaty, 1990) can be described as a method of decomposition of unstructured situations into a simpler one. This method assigns a value to each variant based on the use of the subjective evaluation of the pairwise comparison. Subsequent synthesis identifies the alternative with the highest priority. The aim of the authors is to include into the model as much relevant information as possible, own goals, criteria, and variants and to determine the optimal solution.The Analytic Hierarchy Process (Saaty, How to make a decision: The analytic hierarchy process, Saaty, 1990) can be described as a method of decomposition of unstructured situations into a simpler one.

        <p>The target of our research is to compare the Facebook Messenger chatbots suitable for learning in the selected areas. The methodology of the chatbots selection is described in Sections 2.2 and 2.3.

        <p>We assigned a rating to each variant (47 chatbots) for all formulated quality attributes (Table 2). The evaluation was conducted as a chat conversation: a single evaluator rated in a 1-100 scale answers by the chatbot. The evaluator had scripted questions for the chatbots, but he had to adapt them during the conversation according to the topic or chatbot style of dialogue (e.g., whether the chatbot was able to answer open questions or just used predefined navigation buttons). The hierarchical structure of the model is shown in Table 3.We assigned a rating to each variant (47 chatbots) for all formulated quality attributes (Table 2).

        <p>The next step is to construct a set of pairwise comparison matrices between all criteria and subcriteria. We assign relative ranking to each pair of criteria and subcriteria to determine priorities. An approach based on the Saaty scale was used to compare the criteria (Saaty, The Analytic Hierarchy Process, Saaty, 1980). The relative importance between two criteria is measured according to a numerical scale, as shown in Table 4. If the criterion is more important than the second one, we assign it the value s ij 2 f1; 3; 5; 7; 9g otherwise s ij ¼ 1 sji . By this mutual comparison, we constructed the matrix of pairwise comparisons. Table 5 shows the final comparison matrix for criteria where each cell indicates how much more important the criteria is in the row in comparison to the criteria in the column. For example, the comparison between Humanity and Teaching -Teaching is preferred strongly (5 times) over Humanity, so the value 5 is entered in the position (1,2) and the reciprocal value 1/5 is automatically entered in the transpose position (2,1).The next step is to construct a set of pairwise comparison matrices between all criteria and subcriteria.

        <p>From the matrix, we determine the principal eigenvalue, eigenvector and by its normalization we get the required weights (the scale of priorities). The computed priority vectors represent the relative weights among the criteria that we compared. One can see (Fig. 2) that Teaching is 57%, Humanity is 23%, Affect is 15%, and Accessibility only 5% for educational chatbots. It is visible that the criterion Teaching is the most important for our study. We can say that Teaching is 2.48 times more important than Humanity (3.8 times more important than Affect and 11.4 times more than Accessibility).From the matrix, we determine the principal eigenvalue, eigenvector and by its normalization we get the required weights (the scale of priorities).

        <p>Having analyzed 47 chatbots using human-chatbot conversations, we concluded that the model is too complicated and is not appropriate for the relevant decision. Therefore, we modified the model so that we chose 10 chatbots, which obtained the highest score from the all 47.

        <p>The influence of each criterion on the top ten chatbots is shown in Fig. 4. Illustrating the priority alternatives, it details the contribution of each criterion in the final priority score. Obviously, the influences of the criteria are different from one another. The criterion of Humanity was a very important ability for users using the chatbots that took the top two places (AskFrank and IFRS-Rookies). The Wordsworth and EnglishWithEdwin chatbots were better suited to users who mainly required teaching properties (setting goals, monitoring the learning process, feedback, etc.). Only two of the top ten chatbots (AskFrank and IFRSRookies) were primarily focused on the criterion of Humanity (able to respond to specific questions, able to maintain themed discussion).The influence of each criterion on the top ten chatbots is shown in Fig. 4.

        <p>The value of the consistency ratio is close to 10%. It means that our evaluation of chatbot preference should be consistent and acceptable. One way we can achieve better consistency is a deletion of Accessibility property or to reassess the subjective judgment.The value of the consistency ratio is close to 10%.

        <p>The purpose of the present research was to investigate the current availability of educational chatbots on the Facebook Messenger platform and examine their quality. Although web-based chatbots have been available for several decades, a big step forward comes from chatbots moving to an instant messaging environment. Beyond texting, an instant messaging application can include additional features and capabilities: voice and video messages, calling, gaming, e-commerce, media sharing, animated GIFs, stickers, advertisements or chatbots. Downloading and installing a single-purpose application is not necessary. Using an instant messaging platform Extreme importance such as Facebook Messenger for hosting a chatbot brings the benefits of a familiar user interface and utilization of existing mobile infrastructure. This research was the first to review educational chatbots on the Facebook Messenger platform and examines them based on the subject matter, conversation language and development platform. The findings from our research show that the majority of the chatbots (89%) used English as a communication language. Results also showed, nearly half of chatbots (46%) were lacking any discussion techniques or simulation of the human conversation and used button-based browsing or automated answers with additional information on websites outside the chatbot interface. Based on subject matter analysis, chatbots mostly deal with learning languages, economic topics or multiple subject matter. From the developer's point-of-view, the Chatfuel service was identified as the most common platform (40%) used between building tools.The purpose of the present research was to investigate the current availability of educational chatbots on the Facebook Messenger platform and examine their quality.

        <p>With the exponential growth of chatbots, we can ask how intelligent chatbots are? According to the report (Weinberg, 2017), 70% of Facebook Messenger chatbots were failing to fulfil user requests. Therefore, rather than building a large chatbots ecosystem, Facebook started to train Messenger chatbots to deal with a narrower set of cases so users would not be disappointed by the automation limitations. Next step for chatbots was recent progress in natural language processing and machine learning. They are constantly learning and improving from conversations with users and do generate responses based on collections of known conversations saved in databases. This is perhaps an appropriate occasion to raise the question, if chatbots are built to process a large amount of data, why not use them as teaching assistants? In 2016, Professor Ashok K. Goel developed chatbot called Jill Watson for students enrolled in a Georgia Institute of Technology's Master program (Eicher, Polepeddi, &amp; Goel, 2018). This virtual teaching assistant is based on IBM's Watson and is able to answer routine, frequently asked questions on the class discussion forum. Lars Satow (Satow, 2017) developed a model for the future, which describes the levels of learning facilitation by artificial intelligence teaching assistants:With the exponential growth of chatbots, we can ask how intelligent chatbots are?

        <p>� Level 1: Personalized messages from the teaching assistant welcomes new learners. � Level 2: Teaching assistant advises learning materials, suggests following steps, possible collaborators and professionals for cooperative learning. � Level 3: Teaching assistant responses to usual questions posted by students. � Level 4: Teaching assistant establishes the steps to meet learning objectives and supervises the improvement of learning. � Level 5: Teaching assistant gives personalized comments. � Level 6: Teaching assistant offers individualized comments and endorsements, analyzes individual learning requests and provides tutoring instructions.� Level 1: Personalized messages from the teaching assistant welcomes new learners. � Level 2: Teaching assistant advises learning materials, suggests following steps, possible collaborators and professionals for cooperative learning. � Level 3: Teaching assistant responses to usual questions posted by students. � Level 4: Teaching assistant establishes the steps to meet learning objectives and supervises the improvement of learning. � Level 5: Teaching assistant gives personalized comments. � Level 6: Teaching assistant offers individualized comments and endorsements, analyzes individual learning requests and provides tutoring instructions.</p>

        <p>With the exception of two (Ask Frank, IFRSRookies), most chatbots are mechanic in their behavior and answers, they lack basic interaction and communication patterns, their responses are based on button-based navigation, and they miss the skills of text-based command recognition. There was no significant difference in accessibility between educational chatbots and reactions were generally weak. Only Ask Frank was able to respond to a simple questions, such as "How are you?", "Can we chat?" or "What is your name?". Conversational style, tone, and attitude of the chatbotthe personality is critical to the success of natural dialogue between human and computer. Due to data provided by Facebook developers can easily personalize the greeting text using the person's name. We found that (N ¼ 23, 49%) of educational chatbots were able to greet the user with a person's name. The Facebook Messenger platforms also support rich media, like images, animated GIFs and videos. These dynamic elements go a long way towards imbuing chatbots with personality. They make the conversation more enjoyable, more immersive, and more visually engaging. Emojis are another way to add personality in an entertaining and evocative way.With the exception of two (Ask Frank, IFRSRookies), most chatbots are mechanic in their behavior and answers, they lack basic interaction and communication patterns, their responses are based on button-based navigation, and they miss the skills of text-based command recognition.

        <p>Based on the Lars Satow's model of learning facilitation, educational chatbots on Facebook Messenger platform vary between Level 1 and Level 4. Personalized welcome messages are simple to implement. Learning content is part of the chatbot knowledgebase, could be obtained from the web sources (e.g. a computational knowledge engine like Wolfram Alpha for Ask Frank), as well as providing links to websites. Chatbots are using pattern matching to classify text and produce a response. To be able to answer typical questions asked by learners, the intelligence of a chatbot depends on how these predefined patterns are defined and how well the text is analyzed and processed. Another way is to use a generative model with support of a neural network. This self-learning chatbot is trained using a large number of previous conversations with the users. It is always ready to have a response but this could be random and not always make a sense. Implementing a Question &amp; Answer system to a chatbot looks like a default setting, but it requires a critical amount of data and expertise to create a conversational flow. Findings demonstrated, however, that all of the top ten educational chatbots were using quizzes or a Question &amp; Answer module, which can help during the learning process for users. Gamification is a great way to engage students. Supporting this, results showed a game element, like a point system, was applied in four chatbots (Feed.Mind, Kuni, NELA, Mastermind Games Bot) out of the top ten. A broadcast functionality in a chatbot is able to send users reminders and keep them engaged with the chatbot. Users of the Wordsworth chatbot can sign up for a daily lesson or take a fun quiz to test their vocabulary skills.Based on the Lars Satow's model of learning facilitation, educational chatbots on Facebook Messenger platform vary between Level 1 and Level 4.

        <p>The present research was bound by several limitations, pointing out the directions for future improvement. For chatbot developers and even users, discoverability is one of the biggest challenges. There is no single place, where can we find chatbots on Facebook Messenger. One limitation was that chatbots for our research were selected from the bot-listed website (Botlist.com) using the Messenger and Education category as a filter. It is important to bear in mind that the scope of this research simulates possible user's searching strategy. These chatbots are promoting themselves as educational, no matter what is the actual content. Therefore, they come into sight of users using common search terms. Furthermore, the findings of this research provide insights for the limited view of publicly accessible and user-marketed educational chatbots from a time period of March-April 2018. We may obtain different results of the equivalent study when repeated at a different time.The present research was bound by several limitations, pointing out the directions for future improvement.

        <p>The study examined the educational chatbots in the instant messaging application Facebook Messenger with focus to identify discoverability and characteristics as language, subject matter and developer's platform. The study also focused on the evaluation of selected chatbots to describe their current stage of learning facilitation using artificial intelligence. Educational chatbots on the Facebook Messenger platform vary from the basic level of sending personalized messages, to recommending learning content. These findings provide further evidence to suggest that chatbot programming (especially on the Facebook Messenger) is still in its early stages. Further features include artificial intelligence teaching assistants answering typical questions posted by learners, setting learning goals, and monitoring learning progress. The future research can be divided into two fields. The first field is to focus on the developers support to create and offer tools that allow any teacher to integrate chatbots into their classes without difficulty, and provide educational chatbot guidelines to successfully support coaching methods and students' learning. The second field is a content analysis of the actual conversations with students. It is technically possible to store, collect and analyze conversations from both macro and micro angles.The study examined the educational chatbots in the instant messaging application Facebook Messenger with focus to identify discoverability and characteristics as language, subject matter and developer's platform.
