        <p>This study provides an overview of state-of-the-art research on Artificial Intelligence in the business context and proposes an agenda for future research. First, by analyzing 404 relevant articles collected through Web of Science and Scopus, this article presents the evolution of research on AI in business over time, highlighting seminal works in the field, and the leading publication venues. Next, using a text-mining approach based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation, latent topics were extracted from the literature and comprehensively analyzed. The findings reveal 18 topics classified into four main clusters: societal impact of AI, organizational impact of AI, AI systems, and AI methodologies. This study then presents several main developmental trends and the resulting challenges, including robots and automated systems, Internet-of-Things and AI integration, law, and ethics, among others. Finally, a research agenda is proposed to guide the directions of future AI research in business addressing the identified trends and challenges.This study provides an overview of state-of-the-art research on Artificial Intelligence in the business context and proposes an agenda for future research.

        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping business, economy, and society by transforming experiences and relationships amongst stakeholders and citizens. The roots of AI may lie in ancient cultures of Greek (e.g., the mythological robot Talos), Chinese (e.g., YueyingArtificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping business, economy, and society by transforming experiences and relationships amongst stakeholders and citizens.

Yet, the term emerged in a workshop at Dartmouth College (United States) in 1956 (Nilsson, 2010), which is dubbed the birth of AI.</p>
        <p>Since then, research on AI has stemmed from different fields of knowledge. Social scientists have been discussing ethical and legal implications of AI (Cath, 2018), computer scientists have developed advanced deep learning algorithms (LeCun, Bengio, &amp; Hinton, 2015), while researchers in business management have studied the impacts of AI on customers, firms, and stakeholders in an increasingly automated and interrelated business world (Huang &amp; Rust, 2018). However, such advances in AI research have mainly been done in isolated silos with few interdisciplinary exchanges. Similarly, a unique and consensual definition of AI has been hard to get. Recently, Russell and Norvig (2016) summarize the various definitions of AI systems into four categories along two dimensions: reasoning-behavior dimension and human performance-rationality dimension. These are: (1) systems that think like humans, (2) systems that act like humans, (3) systems that think rationally, and (4) systems that act rationally. AI systems should have the following capabilities: natural language processing to communicate in a natural language, knowledge representation to store information, automated reasoningthe use of the stored information to answer questions and to draw new conclusions, and machine learning to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns (e.g., Russell &amp; Norvig, 2016;Huang &amp; Rust, 2018). Yet, the lack of a consensual definition has not prevented the spread of research for new applications of AI in the world.Since then, research on AI has stemmed from different fields of knowledge.

        <p>The worldwide spending on cognitive and AI systems has been growing steadily for the past years with $24.0 billion being spent in 2018. Such investment is expected to grow to $77.6 billion in 2022 (IDC, 2019). In order to encourage further advancements in research on business applications of AI, which often require a multidisciplinary perspective, AI practitioners and researchers will benefit from a comprehensive knowledge about what has been investigated and applied in different business domains (i.e., from manufacturing to services) and in different disciplinary fields, such as marketing, tourism, management, sociology, psychology, and so on. Such a comprehensive knowledge will provide researchers a foundation to prioritize research foci and practitioners to guide effective investment in important aspects of AI for business.The worldwide spending on cognitive and AI systems has been growing steadily for the past years with $24.0 billion being spent in 2018.

        <p>Notably, several researchers have attempted to conduct a comprehensive literature review on the use of AI in business. For example, Côrte-Real, Ruivo, and Oliveira (2014) perform a systematic mapping of the diffusion stages of business intelligence and analytics (BI&amp;A) implementation, proposing a future research in the then rather neglected post-adoption stages. Moro, Cortez and Rita (2015) conduct a literature analysis between 2002 and 2013 focused in Business Intelligence (which uses some AI algorithms for predictive analysis) in Banking. Tkáč and Verner (2016) review two decades of research on the application of artificial neural network in business and found most of the examined articles discussing expert systems with applications. Finally, Duan, Edwards, and Dwivedi (2019) analyze relevant articles published in International Journal of Information Management to identify issues and challenges around AI for decision making in the era of big data, proposing theoretical development and AI implementation. While these efforts present useful knowledge about the advancements in AI and business research, they focus either on specific applications (e.g., artificial neural network, BI&amp;A) or domains (e.g., decision support system). To address this gap, the current paper aims at providing an overview of extant research on AI in business by comprehensively analyzing the evolution and state-of-the-art research on AI, as well as identifying future trends in order to provide useful directions for future research in the field. Specifically, the current study uses (1) a graph mining analysis to map citations of prominent studies in the relevant literature and (2) a text mining approach similar to the ones used by Loureiro et al. (2018), Guerreiro et al. (2016), Moro et al. (2017) and Cortez et al. (2018) to classify the extant studies into latent topics and evaluate how such research has evolved over time.Notably, several researchers have attempted to conduct a comprehensive literature review on the use of AI in business.

        <p>In order to identify the most relevant literature for this review, a set of articles discussing AI was collected from both Web of Science and Scopus online libraries. Papers that had the terms "artificial intelligence" or "artificial-intelligence" in their title, abstract, and keywords, that were published in peer-reviewed journals in business-related categories were selected. Table 1 shows the query terms per each online library. A total of 805 articles were extracted from journals indexed in Web of Science and 900 papers were extracted from the Scopus database. A first look at the 1488 papers revealed that there is a big dispersion of the papers among many different journals and topics. Even after restricting the query to Business related articles, there were many papers in other related topics. After a manual review of the abstracts, 903 articles were excluded because they were discussing technical issues (and not business implications) around engineering issues, 29 articles were excluded because they were more focused on algorithm development, and 27 papers were excluded due to being too much focused on other related topics such as applications on pedagogical education. After this initial screening, the full text of 529 potentially relevant articles were analyzed using a systematic analysis approach. Four criteria were used for the full text screening process: validity, reliability, credibility, and integrity (Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, Altman, &amp; Altman, 2009;Nill &amp; Schibrowsky, 2007). Two researchers conducted an independent identification of the relevant articles following the quality criteria suggested by Macpherson and Holt (2007) and classified the papers according to the topic intended for the investigation: AI in Business (see Appendix A). Conflicts between researchers were discussed to reach an agreement with Cohen's Kappa coefficient &gt;0.85. A final group of 404 articles was identified for a final analysis (see figure 1).In order to identify the most relevant literature for this review, a set of articles discussing AI was collected from both Web of Science and Scopus online libraries.

        <p>The literature on AI in business-related categories started in 1977 with a first paper published in Futures journal that addresses how AI was applied to problems in medicine (Coles, 1977). In fact, Futures is the journal that gathers the greatest number of papers discussing the implications of AI in business categories (20), followed by the Journal of Operational Research Society (19), and Expert Systems with Applications journal (10). Coles's (1997) Articles were also classified according to the business applications that have received an impact from AI. Figure 3 shows the most impacted business applications.The literature on AI in business-related categories started in 1977 with a first paper published in Futures journal that addresses how AI was applied to problems in medicine (Coles, 1977).

        <p>In order to identify seminal works on AI in business, reference network or citation analysis was conducted. First, the references cited in each paper were collected in order to create a network of citations; citations to webpages without any authors and identified title were removed. Each paper (a node) was linked to its cited references using the 
            <rs type="software">Gephi</rs> software (Bastian et al., 2009). Such links (the edges) were then optimized. Duplicate citations were merged so that one distinct source paper is linked to all its target citations.
        </p>
        <p>The final directed graph had 13,241 nodes and 13,869 edges. Unconnected nodes were also filtered using the Gephi's "giant component" filter. Finally, the in-degree (the number of citations from the collected papers pointing to each referenced paper) for each node was calculated.The final directed graph had 13,241 nodes and 13,869 edges.

        <p>Results show that there is a very scattered network of paper citations. Despite a large number of citations, not many seminal references were cited in most papers. Table 2 shows the top citations sorted by in-degree scores. The reference with the highest indegree score is a book from Russel and Norvig (1995), which was cited 17 times in the dataset collected for the purposes of this study (around 4% of the 404 initial papers).Results show that there is a very scattered network of paper citations.

        <p>A topic analysis was conducted on the paper abstracts to uncover latent discussions in the identified literature. The 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> software was used to transform the text into a corpora, using the 
            <rs type="software">tm</rs> and 
            <rs type="software">topicmodels</rs> packages. Text was converted into lower case and whitespaces; numbers and stop-words were removed. The remaining text was tokenized into unigrams and bigrams and converted into a document-term matrix (DTM). To select the number of latent topics, measures taken from Griffiths and Steyvers (2004) and Cao et al. (2009) were used. Figure 4 shows the set of possible topics ranging from K=2 to K=60.

In the current case, the posterior probabilities associated with each paper are not very high, which may be due to the correlations between the topics (see table 3).LDA is based on a hierarchical Bayesian analysis and calculates the posterior probability of each word found in the text and of each document (in the current case, each paper) to belong to a latent topic.

        <p>The profiling of each topic was drawn up by analyzing the papers with the highest posterior probability of belonging to each topic and performing a discussion on the findings of those papers. After analyzing the 18 topics, some groups of discussions emerged as related to how AI may influence the overall society in a broader sense, how it impacts the organizations, what types of systems have been used and what methodologies are employed. Therefore, in order to classify the representative research domains within the field of AI in business, the identified topics are organized into four main clusters: societal impact of AI, organizational impact of AI, AI systems, and AI methodologies.

        <p>A number of articles discuss the topic associated with the use of AI robot, especially in the service context, and its implications for society. Robots are machines capable of handling complex series of actions (Singer, 2009). Service robot systems are autonomous and adaptable interfaces that interact, communicate, and deliver services to an organization or customers (Ashrafian 2014;Wirtz, Patterson, Kunz, Gruber, Lu, Paluch, &amp; Martins, 2018). These systems can learn from past experiences (Pagallo, 2013;Wright &amp; Schultz, 2018) and become connected and embedded into a bigger system via knowledge bases and cloud-based systems (e.g., Wirtz et al., 2018). Service robots can integrate local input (e.g., through cameras, microphones, and sensors), data from a wide range of other sources, such as the internet and organizational knowledge system, as well as biometrics information of customers (e.g., through facial and voice recognition systems) to identify a customer and provide him/her with highly customized and personalized services (e.g., Keisner, Raffo, &amp; Wunsch-Vincent, 2016;Cockshott &amp; Renaud, 2016;Gonzalez-Jimenez, 2018). In this cluster, articles on integrated robot and artificial intelligence (AI robots) (Kamishima, Gremmen, &amp; Akizawa, 2018) compare person-to-person service encounters with those involving the use of AI robots, highlighting which tasks are most appropriate for humans and which can be delivered by machines (e.g., Glushko &amp; Nomorosa, 2013;Huang &amp; Rust, 2018). There are emerging studies discussing the hypotheses that, in the near future, the use of AI robots may become dysfunctional and may cause mental disorders and other psychiatric issues in humans (e.g., Ashrafian, 2017;Wright &amp; Schultz, 2018). In sum, as a warning, researchers and thinkers argue that the use of AI robots can have a huge impact in society, not only because they will be more embedded in service encounters, but they can also put themselves and human beings at risk, become capable of performing creative tasks (thus leave nothing for human beings), and achieve the same level of intelligence of human beings (e.g., Brundage, 2015;Ashrafian, 2017;Wright &amp; Schultz, 2018).A number of articles discuss the topic associated with the use of AI robot, especially in the service context, and its implications for society.

        <p>From the 1980's, continuous work has been done to develop legal expert systems, raising the number of researches on legislation and regulations of AI (e.g., Sehrawat, 2017;Greenleaf, Mowbray, &amp; Chung, 2018). Other studies examine the right to be forgotten in AI memory (i.e., whether or not individuals can request that information made public about themselves be deleted (Gustavsson, 2005), how AI can be associated with public relations, as well as how human-like technologies can operate without human intervention, making their own decisions and acting proactively (Galloway &amp; Swiatek, 2018), thus changing the relationship between firms (machines substituting frontline employees) and customers.From the 1980's, continuous work has been done to develop legal expert systems, raising the number of researches on legislation and regulations of AI (e.g., Sehrawat, 2017;Greenleaf, Mowbray, &amp; Chung, 2018).

        <p>Work impact. This topic is associated with studies that suggest how work will be transformed using AI and other technologies and how such technological innovation generates impact to the organization. As suggested by Lee, Shin, and Baek (2017), organizations should fully utilize and support employees to become fully engaged in their work by establishing general roles and specific tasks. Other studies claim the importance of incorporating AI in organizational decision, project, and enterprise contexts (e.g., Danila, 1989;Jankovi, Cardinal, &amp; Bocquet, 2015), and how AI transforms the nature of work and the employee-machine relationships (e.g., Li Manufacturing. With the fourth industrial revolution, marked by the use of AI and other technologies, production (industrial) may become the main source of prosperity and creation of new jobs in developed countries (Vasin, Gamidullaeva, Shkarupeta, Palatkin, &amp; Vasina, 2018), such as the case of the Russian Federation. AI contributes to optimizing the quality of production system and consequently the quality of products (Olsson &amp; Funk, 2009;Wu, Ren, Zhang, Fan, Liu, Fu, &amp; Terpenny, 2012;Dassisti &amp; Giovannini 2012); AI also allows for production of highly customizable products (Wu, Ren, Zhang, Fan, Liu, Fu, &amp; Terpenny, 2018;Tao, Qi, Liu, &amp; Kusiak, 2018). From this topic emerge the concept of case-based experience reuse, which refers to systems that facilitate experience reuse for different individuals working with standardized production models, or to an efficient experience transfer system, which contributes to more time savings, higher predictability, and less risk (e.g., Dietrich, Kozlenkov, Schroeder, &amp; Wagner, 2003;Olsson &amp; Funk, 2009). As an example, when employees retire or companies need to downsize, organizational knowledge is often lost. New employees require training and they can repeat past mistakes. Using an AI agent enterprises can avoid such situation (e.g., Dietrich, Kozlenkov, Schroeder, &amp;Wagner, 2003;Olsson &amp; Funk, 2009). Russel and Norvig (1995) claim that an agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through effectors. Thus, an agent can be a computer system that interacts with employees, having properties, such as autonomy, social abilities, reactivity, and proactiveness.Work impact.

        <p>Knowledge management. This group of articles deals with systematic management systems of organization's knowledge to create value through initiatives, processes, strategies, and systems that sustain and enhance the storing, sharing, refining, and creating of knowledge (Davis, 1989;Paradice &amp; Courtney, 1989;Smith, Dykman, &amp; Davis, 1989;Shadbolt &amp; Milton, 1998;Siurdyban, Møller, Cheung, Lee, &amp; Wang, 2015). Within an organization, AI is intervening in such systems as lean supply chain (e.g., Choy &amp; Lee, 2003;Liu, Leat, Moizer, Megicks, &amp; Kasturiratne, 2013), quality management systems (Srdoc, Sluga, &amp; Bratko, 2005), and crowdsourcing systems (Bradeško, Witbrock, Starc, Herga, Grobelnik, &amp; Mladenić, 2017).Knowledge management.

        <p>Fuzzy logic approach and risk management. The last topic in the organizational impact cluster aggregates papers focusing on fuzzy logic approach under AI technology to improve the quality of industrial products and reduce failures (e.g., Geramian, Mehregan, Mokhtarzadeh, &amp; Hemmati, 2017;Tsang, Choy, Wu, Ho, Lam, &amp; Koo, 2018). Fuzzy logic is an approach to computing based on degrees of truth rather than the usual true or false (1 or 0) Boolean logic. That is, using the Fuzzy logic, the truth value of a variable may be any real number between 0 and 1 (e.g., Novák, Perfilieva, &amp; Močkoř, 1999). The applications of fuzzy logic are found in automobile industry (Geramian, Mehregan, Mokhtarzadeh, &amp; Hemmati, 2017) and health care sector (Choy, Siu, Ho, Wu, Lam, Tang, &amp; Tsang, 2018). The papers suggest that the fuzzy logic approach contributes to the overall process of quality improvement through risk analysis, risk evaluation, and risk control (e.g., Taylan &amp; Darrab, 2012;Tsang, Choy, Wu, Ho, Lam, &amp; Koo, 2018).Fuzzy logic approach and risk management.

        <p>Expert system. This topic focuses on expert system, which is the knowledge base consisting of facts and heuristics. Facts are information that are publicly available and widely shared and discussed. The performance level of an expert system is a function of the quality and size of its knowledge base. The basic knowledge rule employs if-then statements. The "if" is the premise and represents a group of conditions; when the conditions are satisfied, the "then" (i.e., the conclusion) is inferred (Gupta, 1990). Thus, these articles deal with the development and improvement of algorithms of AI.Expert system. This topic focuses on expert system, which is the knowledge base consisting of facts and heuristics.

        <p>Systems design. This topic deals with the design of flexible manufacturing systems where AI is integrated (e.g., Aiken, Sheng, &amp; Orl, 1991;Chan, Jiang, &amp; Tang, 2000). Intelligent tools, such as expert systems, fuzzy systems, and neural networks, are developed for supporting the flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) or for group decision support systems (GDSS) (Aiken &amp; Orl, 1991). For example, in the automotive industry, nuclear power plants, or other industries, the use of visual interactive simulations and AI simulated representations allow companies to predict the performance of operational systems under different decision-making strategies and to search for improved strategies (Yang, Jeong, &amp; Park, 1994;Chan, Jiang, &amp; Tang, 2000;Robinson, Alifantis, Edwards, Ladbrook, &amp; Waller, 2005;Chakraborty &amp; Boral, 2017).Systems design.

        <p>Information infrastructure. The articles within this topic discuss the creation of expert systems for the interface between industry (a firm) and the public (external to the firm), such as consumers and a wider society. To this end, AI is categorized into four sub-technological fields: problem reasoning and solving (comprising a specific circuit arrangement for performing approximate reasoning where truth values and quantifiers are represented by possibility distributions), machine learning (a system having the capability to automatically add to its current integrated collection of facts and relationships), network structures (the system contains construction details of processors or their interconnections), and knowledge processing systems (a system comprising specific domain data that is integrated as a collection of facts and relationships [knowledge representation] and applies a reasoning technique) (Tseng &amp; Ting, 2013, p.464-465). As AI contributes to the knowledge economy in a network of several countries, the roles of each country in the network can be determined by their performance in the four subtechnological fields of AI, such as disseminators and catch-up players (e.g., Peña, 1998;Antonescu, 2018).

        <p>However, despite the big data being collected and stored, in the end of 2018, 87% of organizations worldwide were still considered as having low analytics maturity (Gartner, 2018). Skilled resources, such as Data Scientists -the professionals that know how to analyze the big data and use it to improve the business-are still scarce (Statista, 2019). In contrast, data mining algorithms have become more accurate and faster in processing data. Although traditional analytical algorithms -such as artificial neural networks (ANN)-are still being successfully implemented in businesses to address problems such as fraud detection (Zakaryazad &amp; Duman, 2016), the recent advent of new algorithms based on deep learning networks and convolution neural networks (Krizhevsky, Sutskever, &amp; Hinton, 2012), have allowed companies to handle complex predictive problems (e.g., image and video processing) (Pouyanfar et al., 2018). Some examples include driver behavior intention to improve how self-driving cars adapt to the consumers' individual characteristics (Shahverdy, et al., 2020), or learning algorithms to predict project profitability (Bilial &amp; Oyedele, 2020).

        <p>AI is often referred to when discussing the future of the working environment. AI agents will someday take over repetitive tasks and maximize efficiency (Huang, Rust &amp; Maksimovic, 2019). As a result, millions of jobs will be lost while new types of jobs will be created due to automation (Ford, 2013;Pueyo, 2018). In the first round of AI impact on work, creative jobs are projected to be safe from AI replacement. In fact, some researchers argue that AI will always fail to recognize and use human creativity (e.g., Holford, 2019) and that a new type of Feeling Economy (based on emotions, empathy and interpersonal relations) will drive job creation (Huang, Rust &amp; Maksimovic, 2019).AI is often referred to when discussing the future of the working environment.

        <p>Yet, recent examples also show AI systems that perform "creative" tasks by producing their own art (Christies, 2018) and music (Guardian, 2018). Just as human beings AI agents are influenced by their experience when developing their creative ideas. AI agents will have more power to learn from their human ancestors to develop new creative and innovative concepts that may be applied in the workplace. This can also contribute to the creation of smart workplaces as AI systems could assist in providing safer working conditions and convenience due to a better understanding of patterns of task fulfillment and creative processes. For example, Hyundai and Mercedes-Benz are already using AI embedded in exoskeletons to help human workers to perform better most repetitive tasks (Wilson &amp; Daugherty, 2018).Yet, recent examples also show AI systems that perform "creative" tasks by producing their own art (Christies, 2018) and music (Guardian, 2018).

        <p>Smart systems are also revolutionizing manufacturing. In fact, Industry 4.0 is already a reality in many medium-to-large companies (Diez-Olivan et al., 2019;Ghobakhloo, 2018). Smart manufacturing, with its roots dating back to the works of Kusiak (1990;2018), represents integrated systems that respond in real-time to the demand of the factory, the supply network, and the customer. The Internet of Things (IoT) will assist companies in measuring their operational performance by implementing connected sensors to track most of their activity (Turner et al., 2019). A company that is already using the benefits of embedding IoT with AI is Nature Fresh Farms, which has reduced packaging times from more than 35 seconds to just 8 seconds by improving the way it screens its fresh products (Forbes, 2018). Furthermore, AI systems will be able to learn from past successes and failures in all the decision layers and come up with better solutions such as lighter and more creative ways to produce airline components or completely new conceptual designs (as the ones developed by PTC-Frustum's AI systems) (PTC, 2018).Smart systems are also revolutionizing manufacturing.

Smart manufacturing, with its roots dating back to the works of Kusiak (1990;2018), represents integrated systems that respond in real-time to the demand of the factory, the supply network, and the customer. The Internet of Things (IoT) will assist companies in measuring their operational performance by implementing connected sensors to track most of their activity (Turner et al., 2019). A company that is already using the benefits of embedding IoT with AI is Nature Fresh Farms, which has reduced packaging times from more than 35 seconds to just 8 seconds by improving the way it screens its fresh products (Forbes, 2018). Furthermore, AI systems will be able to learn from past successes and failures in all the decision layers and come up with better solutions such as lighter and more creative ways to produce airline components or completely new conceptual designs (as the ones developed by PTC-Frustum's AI systems) (PTC, 2018).</p>
        <p>Today, robots can sense their surrounding environment to learn how to interact in the real-world. AI agents embedded in robotic systems are thus evolving as they are learning to walk, to avoid obstacles, and to master complex human skills (Fevre, Goodwine &amp; Schmiedeler, 2019;Singh &amp; Bera, 2020). There has also been an increasing development in human-AI interactions to help AI agents learn faster by asking for (human) help when confronted with a limitation, just like a human does in its evolution (Silva, Faria, Melo, &amp; Veloso, 2017). The proliferation of automated systems that are using AI to execute complex tasks, such as self-driving cars and customer service bots, will eventually lower the cost of producing such systems, making them more readily available (Ivanov and Webster, 2019). In addition, as AI agents are integrated into daily experiences (e.g., as customer assistants or factory workers), and particularly in tasks where they take the master role in the human-object relationship, as put forward by Schweitzer et al. (2019), they will also become a new type of buyer. An example would be an AI system embedded in a smart device or an AI-embedded robot that would search, filter, select and buy a set of goods on behalf of their owners without explicit consent other than following its owner patterns of behavior.Today, robots can sense their surrounding environment to learn how to interact in the real-world.

        <p>The implications of a hybrid working environment are humans and AI systems working together and changing how managers and owners need to act to ensure a healthy working balance between multiple different needs (Kaplan &amp; Haenlein, 2018). Today, companies are already using AI systems to help managers decide who to hire. Unilever, for example, has been using HireVue to successfully analyze and survey thousands of potential candidates for internships, while L'Oreal has been using a similar approach to recruit international candidates and the time needed to screen a candidate has decreased by 90% (Black &amp; van Esch, 2020). Such automated systems based on AI, although still in its infancy, are known to be much less biased and much more objective than traditional Human based recruiting (Van Esch, Black, &amp; Ferolie, 2019). A more distant future trend may rise from the use of brain-computer interfaces to enhance cognitive skills for both managers and employees.The implications of a hybrid working environment are humans and AI systems working together and changing how managers and owners need to act to ensure a healthy working balance between multiple different needs (Kaplan &amp; Haenlein, 2018).

        <p>Although DBS is not a new field in cognitive neuroscience and has been used to treat neurological conditions and in neuroprosthetics (Rouse et al., 2011;Horch &amp; Dhillon, 2004), its maturation has allowed its use to extend to other fields, such as immersive realities or memory enhancement (Cangelosi &amp; Invitto, 2017). Yet, despite the evident benefits of using BCI for commercial applications, the future and potential applications will face numerous ethical challenges (Glannon, 2016), especially because of the possibility of such systems creating a new type of hybrid humans (Humans 2.0) with levels of intelligence much higher than their older, "natural" generation. Such cognitive difference will have significant business implications as more intelligent workforce may dominate society.Although DBS is not a new field in cognitive neuroscience and has been used to treat neurological conditions and in neuroprosthetics (Rouse et al., 2011;Horch &amp; Dhillon, 2004), its maturation has allowed its use to extend to other fields, such as immersive realities or memory enhancement (Cangelosi &amp; Invitto, 2017).

        <p>The integration of neurostimulators and nanochips into the brain enhances the human organism toward transhumanism (Bostrom, 2005a;Bostrom, 2014), and eventual creation of the hybrid humans (e.g., Kumar, Dixit, Javalgi, &amp; Das, 2016;Rust &amp; Kannan, 2002;Ng &amp; Wakenshaw, 2017). Transhumanism is a movement that "understands and evaluates the opportunities for enhancing the human condition and the human organism opened up by the advancement of technology" (Bostrom, 2005b, p. 3). Transhumanists believes that the actual biological condition of humans limits them to a range of feelings, thoughts and experiences, which may be leveraged by incorporating technology. The goal of such improvement of human capabilities is their subjective well-being and for organizations to enhance employees' job performance. The meaning behind subjective well-being comprises personal traits of individuals, their positive and negative affect, and life events (e.g., Headey &amp; Wearing, 1989;Myers &amp; Sweeney, 2004;Dodge et al., 2012).The integration of neurostimulators and nanochips into the brain enhances the human organism toward transhumanism (Bostrom, 2005a;Bostrom, 2014), and eventual creation of the hybrid humans (e.g., Kumar, Dixit, Javalgi, &amp; Das, 2016;Rust &amp; Kannan, 2002;Ng &amp; Wakenshaw, 2017).

For example, advanced AI assistants capable of proactively taking actions for their users, as demonstrated by Google Assistant calling a restaurant to schedule a reservation (BBC, 2018), will become the norm in the near future, presenting new ways of delivering and consuming services. Following the self-expansion model (Aron &amp; Aron, 1986) and the extended-self proposed by Belk (2013) we suggest that consumers will increasingly adopt AI technologies (even BCI to enhance their cognitive skills) to reduce repetitive tasks while enhancing hedonic/aesthetic experiences.

        <p>The evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) coupled with AI to form intelligent cyberphysical systems will also bring new implications for how we live our lives. In the near future, it is expected that everything we use in our daily lives will be connected (Leminen et al., 2018). Such networked devices will generate significant amount of realtime behavioral data, which may only be analyzed using AI algorithms to uncover latent knowledge that can be used to help cities becoming better managed and more sustainable (O'Dwyer, 2019). As AI becomes more intelligent, it is expected that smart systems will find ways to optimize the daily lives of city dwellers in ways we have never thought about before. The relationship between companies and suppliers will also need to address the ever increasing need to integrate Big Data information to better serve the consumer and improve production efficiency.

        <p>Deep learning was developed to accurately predict a given outcome by learning from the environment. However, with hidden layers embedded in the networks, they are largely black-boxes (Pouyanfar, et al., 2018). However, recent AI techniques framed under the eXplainable AI (XAI) algorithms are paving the way for future transparent applications based on AI (Arrieta, 2020). However, despite studies conducted to bring transparency to the complex learning procedures that are inherent to AI (Miller, 2019), more research is needed to translate AI language to human language. Yet, not only the communication process between AI systems and humans needs to be settled, a whole AI systems and robots rights charter with duties and obligations should emerge and be approved by an international governing body, such as the United Nations. Current laws governing citizens on tort and liability should be reviewed and potentially extended to include AI systems to regulate who will be liable, for instance, if AI systems and robots caused bodily harm to others (e.g., humans, AI agents, and hybrid beings). In the same line of thoughts, when AI systems produce products/experiences or when they receive and use them, they should be entitled to intellectual property and have the duty to pay taxes. Despite some initiatives are already in place to develop some of these best practices, such as AI for Humanity or the Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence (Nebeker et al., 2019), there is a growing concern that, as AI becomes more intelligent, humans would be unable to control its evolution. A super intelligent society based on AI agents and hybrid humans may bring both enormous benefits and challenges in terms of environmental and societal changes (Pueyo, 2018). Singularity, commonly referred as a state of super intelligence where AI overcomes HI, may occur in the next decades (Turchin, 2018). However, risks and contingencies should be discussed today to prepare for the future. Such risks include lack of safety of future AI systems, lack of transparency, a potential biased and unfair treatment from self-learning systems which may deepen socio-economic inequalities and the degree of dependency of HI from such intelligent systems (Green, 2018). So far, recommendations of how machine Ethics should be imposed on future systems have been focused mainly on a two-way approach that should drive the discussions in the next decade. The first posits that such Ethics should be derived from learning systems that use past moral behaviors and rules from the current society (Bello &amp; Bringsjord, 2012), while the second proposes the definition of a new set of agreed-upon moral rules that should be embedded in every AI system from its inception (Arkoudas et al., 2005). Recent trends suggest a mix of both approaches under a set of hard and soft ethics standards (Floridi et al., 2018). Following such predicted advancements in the literature, we frame the fourth AI trend under AI integration, and Law and Ethics (see table 5).
