        <p>With the outbreak of COVID-19, contact tracing is becoming a used intervention to control the spread of this highly infectious disease. This study explores an individual's intention to adopt COVID-19 Digital Contact Tracing (DCT) apps. A conceptual framework developed for this study combines Procedural Fairness Theory, Dual Calculus Theory, Protection Motivation Theory, Theory of Planned Behaviour, and Hofstede's Cultural Dimension Theory. The study adopts a quantitative approach collecting data from 714 respondents using a random sampling technique. The proposed model is tested using structural equation modeling. Empirical results found that the perceived effectiveness of privacy policy negatively influenced privacy concerns, whereas perceived vulnerability had a positive influence. Expected personal and community-related outcomes of sharing information positively influenced attitudes towards DCT apps, while privacy concerns had a negative effect. The intention to adopt DCT apps were positively influenced by attitude, subjective norms, and privacy self-efficacy. This study is the first to empirically test the adoption of DCT apps of the COVID-19 pandemic and contributes both theoretically and practically towards understanding factors influencing its widespread adoption.With the outbreak of COVID-19, contact tracing is becoming a used intervention to control the spread of this highly infectious disease.

        <p>Contact tracing involves identifying and informing individuals who have come in contact with a COVID-19 positive patient. Manual procedures for contact tracing are not efficient enough to control the spread of the virus. Globally governments have resorted to technology to provide an innovative solution to this problem [3]. Therefore, with smartphone usage becoming ubiquitous, there is an opportunity to leverage this technology for Digital Contact Tracing (DCT). DCT would allow for an almost instantaneous alert to be sent to close contacts of the diagnosed patients to self-isolate. This system would utilize location data obtained through Bluetooth from smartphones to trace individuals and their interactions [4]. Despite this method having the potential to reduce the inefficiency of manual contact tracing, it has given rise to significant privacy concerns. For the successful implementation of DCT apps, a higher "transmission rate" than COVID-19 is required for DCT apps to assist in fighting this pandemic.Contact tracing involves identifying and informing individuals who have come in contact with a COVID-19 positive patient.

        <p>Privacy decision making was found to be a rational process of weighing the costs and benefits [9,10]. However, studies are producing contradictory findings relating to privacy and information disclosure. Barth and De Jong [11] found the decision-making process to be irrational with individuals giving minimal to no consideration to privacy risk factors. This highlights the contextual nature of privacy decision making [12] and suggests the requirement for further studies in different contexts [13,14].Privacy decision making was found to be a rational process of weighing the costs and benefits [9,10].

        <p>A review of the privacy literature highlights that minimal studies have been undertaken to date in developing countries. This study is the first to consider the privacy and information sharing dilemma in Fiji. Fiji is an island country located in the South Pacific. The two major islands of the country are Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. The capital city of Suva is located on the island of Viti Levu [17]. The country has a population of approximately 750,000 [18]. Despite Fiji being the most developed country in the South Pacific, it differs from other developed countries in terms of their economy, cultural and technological infrastructure, and legal environment [19].A review of the privacy literature highlights that minimal studies have been undertaken to date in developing countries.

        <p>This study offers important managerial insights. First, it it beneficial to app developers and those in-charge of its successful implementation in realizing issues influencing the adoption of DCT apps. Second, the study assists app developers in their efforts to develop DCT apps that individuals are more likely to adopt. Third, the study offers insights for government departments charged with the implementation of DCT apps to formulate strategies that would be most effective in reducing an individual's concerns towards these apps. This can be in terms of helping individuals realize the personal and community benefits of adopting DCT apps.This study offers important managerial insights.

        <p>Information disclosure is defined as individuals revealing personal information voluntarily and intentionally to others [20]. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, information disclosure by individuals can help automate the contact tracing efforts. Several different countries have various methods and apps for contact tracing. For example, in March 2020, Singapore developed and implemented an app called 
            <rs type="software">TraceTogether</rs>. The app uses Bluetooth technology to collect information regarding users who have been in close proximity to one another. This information is used by the health ministry to track and contact all individuals who have come in contact with a COVID-19 patient. However, the country has seen a low uptake of this application by citizens [21]. Australia launched its DCT software named 
            <rs type="software">COVIDSafe</rs>, in late April 2020. The app allows smartphones to perform a "digital handshake" when it comes within five feet of another device and notifies users if they have come into contact with a diagnosed person for more than 15 minutes. A similar app was expected to be launched by New Zealand in early May 2020. The country is relying on the citizens' voluntary adoption of this app.
        </p>
        <p>Privacy Foundation Chair, Gehan Gunasekara, has stated that trust in the government's commitment towards data protection is vital to ensure the successful adoption of this app [22].Privacy Foundation Chair, Gehan Gunasekara, has stated that trust in the government's commitment towards data protection is vital to ensure the successful adoption of this app [22].</p>
        <p>France has also launched a location tracing app called 
            <rs type="software">StopCovid</rs> in June. This app uses Bluetooth technology to track users who have been in close contact for more than 15 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>The French app uploads the collected data on centralized government servers [23]. A similar app called Corona-Warn-App has abeen launched in Germany. The app does not log the location of individuals and also recognizes other users of the app in close proximity [24]. This was done to reduce the privacy concerns of individuals.

        <p>
            <rs type="software">CareFiji</rs> [25]. The technology giants Apple and Google have formed an alliance to develop a similar app that would be part of the mobile-phones operating systems by mid-May 2020. This will be a significant step in DCT efforts as together, both companies own about 99 percent of the smartphone market share. Thus it can be seen that the governments of several countries have identified the potential for DCT apps in the fight with COVID-19. As such, this study provides initial empirical evidence regarding individual's factors influencing their privacy concerns and intention to adopt DCT apps.
        </p>
        <p>The privacy calculus theory has been used extensively to investigate concerns relating to privacy [10]. According to this theory, individuals are more likely to disclose personal information if the risk-benefit analysis is favorable [26]. However, there are certain limitations of this theory. First, the risk-benefit assessment of information disclosure is contextual [27].The privacy calculus theory has been used extensively to investigate concerns relating to privacy [10]. According to this theory, individuals are more likely to disclose personal information if the risk-benefit analysis is favorable [26]. However, there are certain limitations of this theory. First, the risk-benefit assessment of information disclosure is contextual [27].</p>
        <p>Second, this theory ignores the antecedents of privacy concerns. To address these gaps, Li [28] proposed a dual calculus model. The dual calculus model assumes that the risk calculus influences the privacy calculus, which impacts on information disclosure. The risk calculus is based on balancing the expected risk and coping effectiveness of individuals [10]. The coping mechanisms reduce privacy concerns while the expected risk increases [28].Second, this theory ignores the antecedents of privacy concerns.

        <p>Therefore, based on the risk calculus theory, this study considers perceived severity and perceived vulnerability as threats to information disclosure in DCT apps, while privacy selfefficacy would be used to measure coping effectiveness. Based on the privacy calculus theory, the benefits of DCT apps would be expected personal outcomes of sharing information and potential community-related outcomes of sharing information while the risk would be the privacy concerns of adopting DCT apps.Therefore, based on the risk calculus theory, this study considers perceived severity and perceived vulnerability as threats to information disclosure in DCT apps, while privacy selfefficacy would be used to measure coping effectiveness.

        <p>According to the TPB, an individual's intention to adopt DCT apps is driven by their attitude, perceived behavioral control (PBC) and subjective norms. Attitude is defined as an individual's overall assessment of the intended behavior that is formed based on their evaluations and perceived outcomes [29]. In this study, attitudes towards contact tracing apps are influenced by expected personal outcomes of sharing information, expected community-related outcomes of sharing information, and privacy concerns. Subjective norms are an individual's perception of significant others' beliefs or socially imposed normative pressure that leads them to act [29].According to the TPB, an individual's intention to adopt DCT apps is driven by their attitude, perceived behavioral control (PBC) and subjective norms.

        <p>Culture concerns shared societal perceptions, beliefs, and values. The information systems literature highlights culture at various levels, such as national, organizational, group, and individual [19]. The societal norms and practices have a profound impact on societal acceptance and adoption of technology [19,30]. This study explores the cultural dimensions at an individual level to moderate the impact between information privacy concerns and attitude towards DCT apps using the dimensions of culture proposed by Hofstede [31]. According to Hofstede [32], national culture scores should not be used to understand an individual's behavior [32]. National cultural dimensions are exhibited through an individuals' espoused cultural values [33]. This study adopts two dimensions of culture proposed by Hofstede, namely collectivism and uncertainty avoidance. These are the two most applied and relevant dimensions of culture to understand technology adoption [19].

        <p>Extant literature on privacy states that personal information shared by individuals can be collected by institutions or organizations if individuals have given consent [34,35]. For an organization to extract and use an individual's data, the organization must have a privacy policy that highlights the use of data and how the information will be safeguarded [36]. Individuals who are willing to use the services must agree to the terms and conditions of the privacy policy and provide consent to use their personal information.Extant literature on privacy states that personal information shared by individuals can be collected by institutions or organizations if individuals have given consent [34,35].

        <p>The perceived effectiveness of privacy policy is an individual's understanding of a set of written statements obtainable during user registration, which highlights an organization's or developer's intention to use the personal information extracted and how this data will be safeguarded [37]. In a mobile phone application context, Zhao et al. [38] elucidated that privacy policy explains to the users how their data will be used by the business. The privacy policy only becomes effective when the users of the product or service believe in the commitment of the organization to protect their information [36]. According to a study on the motivation to self-disclose personal information in mobile applications, the privacy policy is an effective strategy to address privacy concerns due to the existence of a negative relationship between the two constructs [39]. This indicates that individuals are more likely to share their personal information if they feel the information is protected and will not be misused [40].

The display of such seals encourages individuals to register for products and services with the assurance that the information they provide will not be misused. For mobile applications, it becomes the responsibility of the developers to safeguard the personal information provided by the users [41]. The independent certifying agencies will then monitor whether the developers are abiding by the industry regulations [37]. This reduces the information privacy concerns of users. Gong et al.

        <p>Such actions are driven by the perceived negative consequences and impact of losing personal or private data [43]. These concerns are magnified for mobile phone users due to the interconnectedness of individuals, things, and objects. Wang et al.

A further study on the privacy concerns of sharing health information in online health communities stated the deep concern of privacy relating to the sharing of health information being influenced by a high degree of perceived severity of the information being misused [10]. Privacy concerns have become greater for some individuals due to the increase in negative activities such as identity theft and internet fraud [44]. Thus, in the context of the contact tracing application, individuals who perceive that the information gathered from this mobile phone application will be misused, are more concerned about the privacy of their personal health information.

        <p>Perceived vulnerability is an individual's evaluation of possibly encountering a threat [45]. An individual's perception of the negative consequences of sharing personal information is described as vulnerability. The vulnerability of individuals increases when they perceive that disclosure of personal information will lead to potential threats such as abuse or misuse of information [46]. Dinev and Hart [46] study on antecedents and privacy concerns of sharing information on the internet highlighted a positive relationship between perceived vulnerability and privacy concern. Additionally, Mohamed and Ahmad [43] carried out a study in Malaysia that confirmed perceived vulnerability as an antecedent of privacy concerns in sharing information on social networking sites.

        <p>Self-efficacy is a key contract of the social cognitive theory as it evaluates an individual's ability to organize and perform actions that will enable them to achieve the desired performance [47,48]. This solely depends on the individual's self-judgment of their ability to perform an activity. In the context of privacy concerns, privacy self-efficacy is an individual's judgment and confidence of oneself to manage privacy issues [28] and safeguard personal information or data [49]. More knowledge or information regarding a specific activity (high self-efficacy) leads to fewer privacy concerns as individuals become confident in dealing with privacy issues.Self-efficacy is a key contract of the social cognitive theory as it evaluates an individual's ability to organize and perform actions that will enable them to achieve the desired performance [47,48].

Chung [53] explained the expected personal outcome as a way of sharing personal information to assist others. In return, feelings of self-satisfaction and the importance of assisting the greater community are common self-benefits attained from sharing personal information. Additionally, Atkinson et al.

        <p>Another construct explored in the privacy calculus model is the expected community-related outcome of sharing personal information. This construct explains that the community will benefit from the shared personal information [55]. In the virtual environment, seeking and providing social support will only be possible when individuals share their personal information and experiences to make a meaningful impact in the broader community [56]. In the context of this study, it is expected that individuals use the contact tracing application to assist the greater community and prevent the spread of COVID-19. Individuals with a high level of emotional attachment to communities are likely to provide emotional support and assist communities to combat issues [55]. Nevertheless, the intention to use this application to benefit the community depends on an individual's attitude towards the contact tracing application itself and how comfortable one is to share personal information regarding their health and location.Another construct explored in the privacy calculus model is the expected community-related outcome of sharing personal information.

A privacy study on Hofstede's culture theory found that collectivists have a higher rate of acceptance of sharing personal information as these individuals value societal welfare [61]. This is because collectivists are less concerned about information privacy and want the community to benefit from the sharing of information. As such, this study suggests that collectivists will boost the effectiveness of contract tracing application as collectivists are less concerned about information privacy, thus, a positive attitude towards sharing personal information.

They would feel that their knowledge of mobile phones would ensure that their privacy is protected, and they would be able to delete the application when the COVID-19 pandemic is over.</p>
        <p>This study is the first to combine Procedural Fairness Theory, Dual Calculus Theory, Protection Motivation Theory, Theory of Planned Behavior, Hofstede's Cultural Dimension Theory to test an individual's intention to adopt DCT apps empirically. Due to the differences in emphasis of these theories, a study incorporating multiple theories could lead to a more holistic understanding of the phenomenon [28,81]. The resulting model provides a comprehensive understanding of privacy concerns in a time when the world is faced with a global pandemic.This study is the first to combine Procedural Fairness Theory, Dual Calculus Theory, Protection Motivation Theory, Theory of Planned Behavior, Hofstede's Cultural Dimension Theory to test an individual's intention to adopt DCT apps empirically.

        <p>This study takes into account both the antecedents to privacy concerns, which remain an underresearched area in the literature [10], and the consequences of privacy concerns that lead to the adoption of DCT apps.

        <p>Contradictory findings have resulted from studies relating to privacy and information disclosure. While individuals are engaged in rational decision making when it comes to weighing the cost and benefits of disclosing information [9,10], other studies have derived irrational decision making where individuals have given little to no regard to the risk of disclosures [11]. The findings of this study highlight the contextual nature of privacy-related decision making and provide the first empirical evidence regarding individuals' decision making during the COVID-19 pandemic. This research has also contributed theoretically to understanding information disclosure and privacy dilemma in the context of developing countries where research is limited. Such contextual differences are essential to understand information systems behavior as developing countries like Fiji differ in terms of economic, cultural, and technological infrastructure, and legal environment [19]. Studies have highlighted the importance of culture and personality traits in influencing individuals' privacy concerns [9]. This study was able to contribute to this understanding by incorporating cultural dimensions of collectivism and uncertainty avoidance to test privacy concerns and attitudes towards DCT apps. Thus, this study responds to calls of researchers to incorporate cultural values to further understand privacy concerns. Theory building literature has highlighted the importance of testing models and instruments in different country contexts to effectively understand the role of context and its influence on theories [82][83][84]. This study has provided novel empirical evidence from a developing country perspective that provides an improved understanding of how decision making in technology acceptance is influenced by factors such as economy, cultural, technological infrastructure, and the legal environment. This will help to understand the difference in adoption of DCT apps in different countries globally.Contradictory findings have resulted from studies relating to privacy and information disclosure.

        <p>This study has multiple practical implications that would effectively assist policymakers in DCT development in various countries and cultures. Results demonstrate that perceived effectiveness of privacy policy negatively influences privacy concerns. Therefore, the privacy statement regarding the DCT app needs to be transparent and informative. It should stipulate exactly when the collected data will be accessed and how it will be used. Results from this study have shown that this will reduce privacy concerns for individuals. The second dimension of procedural fairness theory about industry self-regulation was not found to be significant.This study has multiple practical implications that would effectively assist policymakers in DCT development in various countries and cultures.

        <p>Looking at the influence of threat appraisals on privacy concerns, only perceived vulnerability was found to be significant. This implies that individuals perceived that their information collected by DCT apps is likely to be misused. However, as a result, it demonstrates that perceived severity was not found significant; this could imply that individuals do not perceive the negative concerns of severity to be an issue. As such, app developers could decrease privacy concerns by ensuring that DCT apps keep data stored on individuals' phones rather than the cloud and only access data if an individual is found to be infected by COVID-19.Looking at the influence of threat appraisals on privacy concerns, only perceived vulnerability was found to be significant.

        <p>The findings of this study highlight that both expected personal outcome and expected community outcomes positively influences attitude towards DCT apps. However, upon closer inspection of the results, it is apparent that the benefit of personal outcomes is far more substantial than community outcomes. This implies the need for governments that are looking to implement DCT apps to highlight both the personal and community benefits of adopting this app. The results of this study have illustrated privacy concerns regarding DCT apps. This highlights the requirement to consider the antecedences giving rise to privacy concerns. App developers and those charged with its successful implementation should appreciate that privacy concerns are the only barrier that needs to be addressed to automate contact tracing efforts.The findings of this study highlight that both expected personal outcome and expected community outcomes positively influences attitude towards DCT apps.

        <p>Cultural differences play an essential part in privacy and information disclosure concerns. This has been confirmed by the results of this study. It has been found that with cultures that are high in collectivism, there is a decreased impact of privacy concerns on attitude towards DCT apps. This implies that implementation of DCT apps would be faced with less resistance in collectivist countries like Brazil, China, India, Japan, Korea, and those in the Pacific when compared to countries with a more individualistic culture like in the USA, Europe, and Australia.Cultural differences play an essential part in privacy and information disclosure concerns.

        <p>The results of this study have shown that attitude is a significant predictor of DCT app adoption intention. This implies the need for app developers and implementors to form a favorable attitude towards these apps to increase adoption intention. The antecedents of perceived personal and community-related outcomes, together with privacy concerns, could highlight the factors that need to be considered when developing a favorable attitude. Subjective norms were also found to influence adoption intention towards DCT apps. This shows the importance of word-of-mouth in encouraging adoption intention. Privacy self-efficacy was also found to influence adoption intention for DCT apps positively. This result highlights the importance of individuals believing in their ability to protect their information privacy before intending to adopt this app. Therefore, the app developers and implementors need to inform potential users of how privacy will be protected as well as for instructions on uninstalling the app when this pandemic has passed.The results of this study have shown that attitude is a significant predictor of DCT app adoption intention.
