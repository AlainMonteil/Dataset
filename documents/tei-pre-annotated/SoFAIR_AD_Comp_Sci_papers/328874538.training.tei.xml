        <p>The spread of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus [1], caused substantial changes in the lifestyle of communities globally. By mid August 2020, over twenty million positive cases in total were identified affecting more than 180 countries and resulting over 750,000 deaths. World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic due to its alarming level of global spread. Healthcare sectors of the countries were affected immediately, urging governments to take immediate control actions, such as isolating highly affected regions, ceasing the cross border traffic between countries, closing the schools, workplaces, and common places, restricting the movements of general public by advising them to stay at home as much as possible. These control actions had a significant impact on the social life and the economies.The spread of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus [1], caused substantial changes in the lifestyle of communities globally.

        <p>Presently, countries are putting their strategies into action to return to the regular lives step by step. However, many countries still have unresolved COVID-19 cases, and report new cases in a daily basis. Therefore, governments must ensure that the "re-opening" will not result in a "re-emergence" of COVID-19 disease.Presently, countries are putting their strategies into action to return to the regular lives step by step.

        <p>Under the prevailing conditions and in a post COVID-19 world, societies face numerous challenges in different sectors including healthcare, education, manufacturing, supply chain management, service delivery, travel and tourism. For instance, overload of healthcare facilities due to exponential increase of COVID-19 patients and inability to provide regular patients with medical assistance due to restricted movements are important obstacles for the healthcare sector's battle against COVID-19. Similarly, delays and the increased resource requirement for manual contact tracing, and unavailability of efficient and automated contact tracing applications hinder the actions for controlling the spread. It is the duty of multiple parties including engineers, technology managers, healthcare workers, government authorities, students, researchers and the general public to act with their fullest potential to control the prevailing situation. Digitalization and the application of information and communication technologies will be imperative to not only to safeguard, but also to manage the post COVID-19 world. The novel technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data, 5G communications, cloud computing and blockchain can play a vital role to facilitate the environment fostering protection and improvement of people and economies. To implement these promising solutions and realize their benefits, technology and engineering managers will have to tackle important challenges and carry out elaborate managerial duties regarding cost, scope, quality, resource and risk management. The wide spectrum of challenges due to COVID-19 under each sector that can be addressed using 5G based solutions are explained in Table I.Under the prevailing conditions and in a post COVID-19 world, societies face numerous challenges in different sectors including healthcare, education, manufacturing, supply chain management, service delivery, travel and tourism.

In the post COVID-19 era, restrictions of public movements may still be in place and governments/authorities will recommend utilizing remote solutions to maintain the social distancing. Existing services should be tailored to cater future needs while developing novel solutions to address the specific issues originated with the pandemic. Since 5G plays a major in providing remote solutions, the paper discusses how different elements in 5G technology can be effectively utilized in developing solutions in a post COVID-19 era. Technical requirements of the usecases are presented in Table II. The table presents relevant 5G applications, expected capacity and latency to deliver a smooth service, number of devices that shall be used and other technical requirements. However, satisfying these requirements to seamlessly provide the services impose a new set of challenges as discussed in Section III.This section elaborates on 5G based use cases of different sectors as depicted in Figure 2, which could be used to manage the post COVID-19 era.

        <p>Remote patient monitoring allows healthcare professionals to monitor conditions of patients at their residence or in a remote facility. Data gathered from different sources such as wearable devices attached to the patient's body [14], patient's own smart mobile device and sensors placed in the patient's room can be used for monitoring. The aggregated data from different sources is examined by the healthcare professional to make a judgement on the patient's condition and take relevant actions. Telemedicine provides remote clinical services to patients with the use of high-quality audio and video streams. Remote surgery is extremely useful in a pandemic which enables a surgeon to perform surgical procedures from a remote facility with his surgical console. Actions of the surgeon are replicated on a patient residing in a different location. A robotic mechanism executes the surgical procedure on the patient and proper haptic feedback is sent back to the surgeon. The feedback can be enhanced by integrating the data from different sensors at the operating theatre to ensure the accuracy. Augmented Reality (AR) technology is useful in telesurgery where experienced surgeons guide other surgeons who perform the surgery next to the patient. Robots deployed at the hospitals minimize the human involvement in treating the hospitalized patients, distributing essential items, performing periodic monitoring. AR technology can be utilized to increase the productivity of the service by providing remote guidance.Remote patient monitoring allows healthcare professionals to monitor conditions of patients at their residence or in a remote facility.

        <p>Role of 5G: 5G enables direct integration of heterogeneous IoT devices into the network via mMTC service, without WiFi or additional IoT gateways. It also supports 10x longer battery life for devices in mMTC and 100x higher device density. Since the remote monitoring of patients requires integration of various low power devices, 5G services can be effectively utilized to build a proper remote monitoring infrastructure for patients. A remote clinical service (telemedicine) which requires 4K video streaming at 25 fps (frames per second) needs a data rate of 8-16 Mpbs. This is realizable with 5G networks via eMBB which supports an average data rate of 100 Mbps. A Local 5G Operator (L5GO) deployment at the healthcare premise is suitable for catering URLLC use case like remote surgery. The ultra-low End-to-End (E2E) latency requirement of a use case like remote surgery [15] is achievable with 5G networks making the application viable. An AR assisted telesurgery require both high bandwidth and ultra-low latency. To avoid cyber-sickness of AR communication, E2E latency should be less than 50 ms [16]. Defining a network slice for AR ensures the service levels and adds extra privacy and security to the data stream. Utilizing robots to assist the patients in hospitals requires precise coordination with a controlling server and between robots, calling for mMTC services of 5G. The coordination and communication between robots happen locally and exact details are mostly irrelevant beyond the premises. Establishing a MEC server to manage the robots guarantees the service levels, provides ultra-low latency, adds extra security and privacy, and reduce congestion in the infrastructure network beyond the MEC server. Figure 2 -A illustrates the possible deployment of L5GO and MEC servers at the hospital premises to support remote surgery, remote patient examinations and treatments, AR applications and robot control. L5GO deployment allow to deploy the core and access networks within the hospital premises.Role of 5G: 5G enables direct integration of heterogeneous IoT devices into the network via mMTC service, without WiFi or additional IoT gateways.

        <p>From a managerial perspective, the implementation of such a telehealth infrastructure is practically challenging in terms of complexity and cost. The engineering management should adopt a total life-cycle approach not just considering the capital expenses for such implementations, but operational costs which can be burdensome in the long term. Moreover, the stringent QoS requirements for telehealth applications require a very integrated and pervasive monitoring and management framework.From a managerial perspective, the implementation of such a telehealth infrastructure is practically challenging in terms of complexity and cost.

        <p>BLE based contact tracing is a better alternative for manual contact tracing which requires a lot of human involvement. A BLE based wearable device advertises an ID periodically and the other compatible devices capture and store with the important details such as timestamp, GPS location data. Once an infected COVID-19 patient is detected, the BLE solution provides the IDs of the close contacts over a defined period. BLE based solutions identify the contacts in the range of few meters, whereas pure GPS based solutions cannot [17]. Mobile device based self-isolation monitoring ensures that the traced contact or the infected COVID-19 patients follow the guidelines. Once the authorities have the knowledge of selfisolation location, random location data using GPS can be captured and analysed to verify the person is following the guidelines during his period of self-isolation. Unmanned Ariel Vehicles (UAV) based solutions can monitor patient condition and self-isolation compliance from a distance. Measuring body temperature via infrared thermography, identifying the person via face recognition algorithms can be used in UAV based solutions.BLE based contact tracing is a better alternative for manual contact tracing which requires a lot of human involvement.

        <p>Role of 5G: BLE based IoT devices can be directly connected to 5G network using 
            <rs type="software">mMTC</rs> services rather than connecting via intermediate gateways, making contact tracing applications more efficient. The longer battery life supported by the 5G network for 
            <rs type="software">mMTC</rs> provides an advantage for lowpower IoT devices. A MEC server deployed at the base station can process the contact tracing data locally. A summarized data set can be sent to the cloud servers for the use of central authorities. A dedicated 5G network slice-based implementation preserves privacy and adds security for the sensitive data.

Moreover, it shows how 5G IoT devices establish the direct connectivity with the 5G network.UAVs directly connected to 5G networks via mMTC service can be controlled by a MEC server [18] deployed at the 5G base station, increasing the scalability.

        <p>In addition to conventional management challenges, the main implication for contact tracing and self isolation for engineering managers is the proper and adequate handling of privacy and security issues, and then the clear communication of how they are handled to the public and public bodies, i.e., communication management. The privacy-protection regulations such as GDPR in Europe are also important factors on how these systems are implemented and managed.In addition to conventional management challenges, the main implication for contact tracing and self isolation for engineering managers is the proper and adequate handling of privacy and security issues, and then the clear communication of how they are handled to the public and public bodies, i.e., communication management.

        <p>The technical managers responsible for the implementation and operational management of such solutions have to be diligent about the user experience since online education has to serve a diverse user base with different levels of technical knowledge and connectivity capabilities. Additionally, the incumbent education practices are heavily geared towards presence based teaching and rely on infrastructure and content appropriate for that mode. Therefore, integration management for legacy systems is an important requirement for realizing online education in 5G ecosystem.The technical managers responsible for the implementation and operational management of such solutions have to be diligent about the user experience since online education has to serve a diverse user base with different levels of technical knowledge and connectivity capabilities.

        <p>IoT based supply chains enable easy identification, tracking and distribution of goods from the manufacturer to the end customer. IoT tags attached to goods update the information on the current status to the central supply chain management system automatically. These are effective to reduce the human involvement in the intermediate distribution centers. Moreover, robots in the warehouses automatically handle the goods at the distribution centers. The final delivery of the items is made with UAVs making it a fully automated supply chain. Blockchain based supply chains [21] will further increase the readability, transparency, security and decrease the cost. This ensures proper delivery of the goods to the final destinations without uneven distribution.IoT based supply chains enable easy identification, tracking and distribution of goods from the manufacturer to the end customer.

Blockchain based supply chains [21] will further increase the readability, transparency, security and decrease the cost. This ensures proper delivery of the goods to the final destinations without uneven distribution.</p>
        <p>Role of 5G: 5G mMTC services support direct connectivity of heterogeneous IoT devices into the network enabling fully automatic IoT based supply chains. MEC is a suitable platform to process data locally to improve the scalability of the systems, security and privacy of collected data. Goods equipped with special tags connect directly to 5G system increasing the transparency. A decentralization of the blockchain can be implemented easily with the MEC [22]. Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) drones [23] connected to 5G network can deliver the goods to the final destinations from a distribution point. The control functions of such UAVs can be placed at the MEC to satisfy required E2E latency. The use of 5G in retail and supply chains is depicted in Figure 2 -D where manufacturer, distributor, end consumer are connected to 5G network and the final delivery is made via 5G drones whenever possible.

        <p>The implementation and management of a 5G and IoT based end-to-end supply chain itself is a challenging task due to the large number of actors and the data. Entities of the entire supply chain should have the technological readiness to realize this and the technology managers must put significant effort at both planning and execution of the deployment projects. UAV based delivery of goods to geographically distributed end consumers is a multifaceted endeavor due to limitations of the drones, regulations in place, security issues, which calls for the design of solid monitoring and management framework to minimize relevant issues on a regular basis.The implementation and management of a 5G and IoT based end-to-end supply chain itself is a challenging task due to the large number of actors and the data.

        <p>For engineering managers, one key aspect is the right scope management for the creation and deployment of these 5Genabled digital services: In order to make them useful and adopted to the greatest extent, the right scope definition (which services targeting which users with what costs) is necessary with the most beneficial and popular ones being deployed first and then gradually extending to less used ones. With this phased approach, the technology and engineering management actors should incorporate the 5G technological concerns such as availability and bandwidths in a location-driven context.For engineering managers, one key aspect is the right scope management for the creation and deployment of these 5Genabled digital services: In order to make them useful and adopted to the greatest extent, the right scope definition (which services targeting which users with what costs) is necessary with the most beneficial and popular ones being deployed first and then gradually extending to less used ones.

        <p>A video recording of a telemedicine activity may contain personal information which the patient would disclose only to the medical professional. In addition, automated contact tracing applications aggregate sensitive location data without the owners' knowledge. Sharing such sensitive user data with unauthorized parties such as third-party advertisers is a serious privacy violation [37]. Drones may capture additional information of bystanders without their knowledge. Attempts by adversaries to attack the databases containing sensitive information pose security risks. The integration of IoT networks increases security risks because such low-end devices are comparably easy to hack and vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks [38]. Massive number of connected devices increases the number of entry points for attackers to perform unauthorized operations, i.e. increases the attack surface of the systems [39].A video recording of a telemedicine activity may contain personal information which the patient would disclose only to the medical professional.

        <p>Possible Solutions: To address the privacy challenge, solutions like Privacy-by-Design [40], software defined privacy [41], privacy preserving protocols for for sink node location in telemedicine [42], must be deployed with 5G applications at the design phase. New privacy preserving protocols for contact tracing which utilizes minimal personal data can be introduced. In addition, lightweight and scalable security mechanisms must be designed to secure MIoTs. Encrypted data transmission and distributed security solutions such as blockchain can prevent attackers gain access to the network and protect the collected user data [22]. For a holistic security and privacy framework, these solutions can be built upon and/or integrated into a smart and trustworthy 5G security platform for the overall 5G ecosystem [43]. Such an inherent security platform embedded in 5G can also alleviate security issues for different use-cases in different network segments.Possible Solutions: To address the privacy challenge, solutions like Privacy-by-Design [40], software defined privacy [41], privacy preserving protocols for for sink node location in telemedicine [42], must be deployed with 5G applications at the design phase.

        <p>Rapid deployment of new applications such as new mobile services, drone based services, online educational platforms will increase the number of 5G users who access such services while adding extra traffic. This will lead to increased network congestion (e.g. 
            <rs type="software">hologram</rs> or 
            <rs type="software">Zoom</rs> software for remote meetings [31]). AR based applications require high bandwidth and low latency. However, a congested network fails to satisfy the service levels required by such applications. This is also valid for drone based video delivery over the network. Manufacturing plants may have to increase the production of specific goods, yearning for the need of quick deployment of extra network resources. Moreover, it is challenging to manage billions of MIoTs [44]. When large number of IoT devices generate ad-hoc data transfers, the network should be scalable to cope with the increased number of traffic events. Possible Solutions: NS in 5G with dynamic scalability is a possible solution to address this problem. The slices serve similar type of services and they can be made adaptive based on the various parameters such as network traffic load, number of IoT devices presently connected. Deployment of virtual NF based on demand at the MEC servers will provide a solution to the congestion due to sudden increase of localized demands. Dynamic deployment of virtual NF in MEC can modify and manage the resources easily in cases where a certain service is no longer required, and a new service has a higher demand locally.
