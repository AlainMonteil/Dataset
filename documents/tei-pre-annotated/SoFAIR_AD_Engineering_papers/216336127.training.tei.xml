        <p>One of the most common plastics in the marine environment is polystyrene (PS) that can be broken down to micro sized particles. Marine organisms are vulnerable to the exposure to microplastics. This study assesses the effects of PS microplastics in tissues of the clam Scrobicularia plana. Clams were exposed to 1 mg L -1 (20 µm) for 14 days, followed by 7 days of depuration. A qualitative analysis by infrared spectroscopy in diffuse reflectance mode period detected the presence of microplastics in clam tissues upon exposure, which were not eliminated after depuration. The effects of microplastics were assessed by a battery of biomarkers and results revealed that microplastics induce effects on antioxidant capacity, DNA damage, neurotoxicity and oxidative damage. S. plana is a significant target to assess the environmental risk of PS microplastics.</p>
        <p>Plastics are used in everyday life and in several items: cars, electronic equipment, furniture, footwear, construction, food packages, among others. The largest plastics producers are the sectors of packaging (39%) and construction (21%), followed by transportation, agriculture, household and electronics (Pinto, 2012). The annual production of plastics increased considerably from 1.5 million tons in 1950 (decade where the commercial development of polyolefins, polypropylene and polyethylene started), to approximately 322 million tons in 2015 (PlasticsEurope, 2015;Wright et al., 2013b), representing an increase of 9% per year, approximately. This production volume, coupled with their high durability, resistance to degradation, low weight and low recycled volume, leads to the widespread and accumulation of discarded plastics in landfills and, as litter, in terrestrial and aquatic habitats worldwide (Derraik, 2002;Moore, 2008;Thompson et al., 2004). The consumption of plastics in many European countries indicates that the plastic resins most used since 2007 are low density polyethylene (LDPE), high density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polystyrene (PS).</p>
        <p>It is not possible to obtain reliable estimates of the amount of plastic debris reaching the marine environment, but they are, however, quite substantial (Derraik, 2002). The major sources of plastic materials and debris in the sea are fishing fleet (Cawthorn, 1989), and marine recreational activities (Pruter, 1987;Wilber, 1987). Plastic also reaches the sea as litter from land-based sources, carried by rivers and municipal drainage systems (Derraik, 2002;Williams &amp; Simmons, 1997). In the sea, these versatile and non-biodegradable polymers are found in the form of larger items (macroplastics), including hulls of boats and fishing nets many meters long, and tiny fragments (Browne et al., 2008;Canesi et al., 2015). When exposed to UV-B radiation, to the oxidative properties of the atmosphere and to the hydrolytic properties of seawater, these plastics brittle and break into smaller pieces, until they reach micrometres in length (microplastics), and potentially, also the nano-scale level (nanoplastics) (Browne et al., 2008;Canesi et al., 2015).</p>
        <p>Microplastics are defined as particles with less than 5 mm in diameter, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the United States of America (NOAA, 2015). Their presence in the ocean is distributed according to the currents (Lusher, 2015). The distinction between primary and secondary microplastics is based on whether these particles were originally manufactured to be that size (primary) or whether they resulted from the breakdown of larger items (secondary) (Kershaw, 2015). The primary source of microplastics includes different typology; polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) from cleaning products or cosmetics (Fendall &amp; Sewell, 2009), or from industries or industrial effluents (Lusher, 2015). The secondary source is the degradation of plastics under marine conditions, that dramatically reduces the molecular weight of these polymers (Andrady, 2011). Ideally, these particles may also undergo further degradation by microbial action, releasing carbon (Andrady, 2011).</p>
        <p>Although microplastics greatly exceed large plastic items in marine systems, they are still only a small proportion of the total mass of plastics in the ocean. Therefore, microplastics became a growing issue in such a way that the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD Nº 2008/56/EC) highlights microplastics and their associated chemicals as one of the major policy descriptors whose impact need to be assessed in the marine environment (Zarfl et al., 2011).</p>
        <p>The presence of microplastics is documented in most habitats in the open ocean, seas and beaches, surface waters, the water column and in the deep ocean (Lusher, 2015), and recently, in freshwater systems (Eerkes-Medrano et al., 2015). In Portugal, 62% of microplastics were identified in the North Atlantic by trawling, with a density of 580 000 particles per km 2 . 61% of the water samples collected in the Portuguese coast contained microplastics and the concentration was higher in the Vicentina Coast and Lisbon (0.036 and 0.033 particles m -3 , respectively) than in the Algarve and Aveiro areas (0.014 and 0.002 particles per m 3 , respectively) (Lusher, 2015).</p>
        <p>The occurrence of plastic in the ocean and the potential impact to marine organisms are of growing concern (Canesi et al., 2015). The fact that microplastics have such a small size and different shapes actively contributes to their bioavailability and accumulation in organisms of lower trophic levels. As the particles interact with plankton and sediments, both organisms that feed on suspended particles and the ones that feed on the bottom are at risk of, accidentally or selectively, ingesting plastic (Lusher, 2015).</p>
        <p>Particles with less than 20 µm are likely to be ingested and egested (Lee et al., 2013) by small organisms (Thompson et al., 2004;Wright et al., 2013b). Microplastics with size between 1 and 5 mm can compromise the nutrition and digestion (Codina-García et al., 2013). The ingestion of plastics with a greater size can cause serious external and internal injuries, ulcers, digestive tract blockage, false sense of fullness, loss of feeding capacity, impairment and inability to avoid predators or death (Gall &amp; Thompson, 2015).</p>
        <p>Microplastics ingestion was documented for a wide range of marine vertebrates and invertebrates for wild populations (Table 1). Whilst it is apparent that microplastics have become widespread and ubiquitous in the marine environment, the information on accumulation, mode of action and biological impact of this emerging contaminant in marine organisms is still scarce (Wright et al., 2013b). Microparticles are inert and, after ingestion, pass through the cell membrane and are incorporated into tissues, particularly in the gut cavity (Wright et al., 2013b). After passing to the circulatory system they are transferred to other organs, via hemolymph, where they are retained for several weeks in several organs and cause adverse effects (Browne et al., 2008). Experiments with different sizes (Mazurais et al., 2015), shapes (Graham &amp; Thompson, 2009) and types (Green et al., 2016) were conducted in order to mimic a more realistic scenario and truly assess the effects of microplastics. Table 2 summarizes the information about the ecotoxicological effects of microplastics in several bivalves that include weight loss, reduced feeding activity, increased phagocytic activity, transference to the lysosomal system, accumulation and inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity (e.g. Avio et al., 2015a;von Moos et al., 2012;Van Cauwenberghe et al., 2015).</p>
        <p>The aim of this study was to investigate the presence and mode of action of polystyrene microparticles (one of the most largely used plastic worldwide, with a density of 1.09 g cm -3 ) in different tissues of the peppery furrow shell Scrobicularia plana and assess the potential ecotoxicological risk of this emerging contaminant in this species.</p>
        <p>The presence of microplastics in gills and digestive gland of S. plana was evaluated by infrared spectroscopy in diffuse reflectance mode and their effects by using a battery of biomarkers of oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidases (GPx), biotransformation (glutathione-S-transferases (GST)), genotoxicity, neurotoxicity and oxidative damage.</p>
        <p>Monodisperse PS microplastics were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Germany) with the particle size 20 µm and density 1.05 g cm -3 . Two stock solutions (100 mg L -1 ) were prepared: one in ultrapure water (18 MΩ/ cm) and another in natural seawater (S = 35), both maintained in constant aeration.</p>
        <p>The microplastics size was determined by optical microscopy (OM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS), and the surface charge (zeta potential) by electrophoretic light scattering (ELS), for both PS solutions. The zeta potential of the microparticles was determined by electrophoresis mobility measurements at 25ºC using a DLS particle sizer (ZetaSizer Nano ZS90, Malvern Inc.) in a disposable polycarbonate capillary cell (DTS1061).</p>
        <p>The sedimentation rate (SR) was measured by the change of turbidity with time (0-24 h), as described in Sousa and Teixeira (2013). The SR relates to the normalized microparticle turbidity C/C0, where C is the turbidity at time t and C0 the initial turbidity at time 0. Then, the SR is given by the expression δ(C/C0)/δt, estimated from the decrease in turbidity (C/C0), which occurred within the first two hours for the fast sedimentation (fast SR) conditions and within 3-24 h for slow sedimentation (slow SR) conditions (Keller et al., 2010).</p>
        <p>Scrobicularia plana (38 ± 5 mm shell length) were collected in Cabanas de Tavira, Ribeira do Almargem (South of Portugal) (N 37º7'59.75'' W 7 36'34.95'') and transferred to the laboratory, where they were acclimated for 7 days at constant aeration, with a photoperiod of 12h light and 12h darkness. Three replicate aquaria were used for each control and exposed group to 1 mg L -1 of PS microplastics which corresponded to around 4 particles ml -1 . This value is below the concentrations used in previous laboratory exposure experiments (summarized in Table 2) although higher than environmentally relevant concentrations of microplastics found in seawater in regions highly contaminated, e.g. ~0.5 particles mL -1 in South Korea (Song et al., 2014) or 0.1 particles mL -1 (Norén, 2007).</p>
        <p>Sixty clams were placed in each glass aquaria filled with 20 L of natural seawater with constant aeration and no sediments were added. Glass Pasteur pipettes were used to provide aeration and the use of plastic material was avoided during the experiment.</p>
        <p>Exposure ran for 14 days, followed by 7 days of depuration. The water was changed every 24 hours with subsequent addition of PS microplastics. Immediately before addition of PS microplastics, the 100 mg L -1 stock solution in ultra-pure water was sonicated for 30 minutes (Ultrasonic bath VWR International, 230 V, 200 W, 45 kHz frequency). During the experiment abiotic parameters were checked in all tanks by measuring temperature (18.0 ± 1 ºC), salinity (35 ± 0.2), percentage of oxygen saturation (93.0 %) and pH (7.8), with the multiparametric probe TRIPOD (from PONSEL). Clams were not fed to avoid any interaction of microplastics and food.</p>
        <p>Unexposed and exposed clams were collected after 0, 3, 7 and 14 days of exposure, and after the 7 days of depuration. The hemolymph was immediately collected by gently prying the shell open approximately 2 to 3 mm with a scalpel and the shell was held open with forceps. Then, the posterior adductor muscle of the S. plana was gently penetrated with a sterile hypodermic syringe 1 ml (12 mm x 12:33) and the hemolymph easily collected using intermittent suction. To avoid potential contamination of the haemolymph, the water inside the shell was drained from each clam prior to hemolymph extraction, and a new syringe was used for each replicate of each treatment and each sampling day. Gills and digestive gland were dissected and stored at -80 ºC until analysis.</p>
        <p>No significant mortality was observed between treatments, during the accumulation and depuration periods (p &gt;0.05).</p>
        <p>A qualitative assessment of microplastics accumulation and transport to different tissues was conducted by optical microscopy (OM) analysis of the hemolymph of control and exposed clams at day 14. In addition, gills and digestive gland tissues collected at different times of exposure were lyophilized at -40 ºC, during approximately 48 hours with a Modulyo freeze dryer and analysed by infrared spectroscopy. This analysis was performed in a Mattson RS1 Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer, with a wide band MCT (mercury cadmium telluride) detector, in the range 400-4000 cm -1 , at 4 cm -1 resolution. Since the samples were powders, in order to avoid compressing the tissues to the high pressures needed to prepare disks, the most convenient mode for obtaining the spectra was in diffuse reflectance (DRIFT). Each lyophilized sample was diluted (~1:4) in KBr (from Aldrich, FTIR grade) and finely grinded in an agate mortar, to reduce particle size and thus decreases diffuse Fresnel reflectance. This mixture was placed in a 11 mm diameter sample cup and pressed to obtain a very smooth surface. The cup was filled, in order to attain a so-called infinite thickness (all the light is reflected or absorbed by the sample) and mounted in a Graseby/Specac Selector accessory, to collect all the diffusely reflected radiation, excluding specular reflection. Each DRIFT spectrum resulted from the ratio of 500 single-beam scans obtained for the sample to the same number of background scans for pure KBr.</p>
        <p>The spectra in reflectance (R∞) were transformed into Kubelka-Munk units [f(R∞)] using the 
            <rs type="software">FIRST</rs> software, according to the Kubelka-Munk equation (Mitchell, 1993;Stuart, 2005)
        </p>
        <p>The spectra were baseline corrected, normalized to a typical band of the tissues not overlapped with a PS band, and the average of 10 samples was calculated.</p>
        <p>To assess the physiological status of control and PS exposed clams, soft tissues and shells were weighted, and the condition index (CI) determined as the percentage (%) of the ratio between drained weight of the soft tissues (g) and total weight (g), according</p>
        <p>to Gomes et al. (2013).</p>
        <p>Prior to the analysis of the enzymatic activities, the tissues (gills and digestive glands) of control and microplastic exposed clams (6 replicates of individual tissues) were weighed and rapidly buffered in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 250 mM Sucrose, 5mM MgCl2, 1mM DTT, pH=7.6) (the tissue-to-buffer ratio was 1:3 wet weight tissue/volume of buffer), homogenized in an ice bath and centrifuged at 10000 g, for 10 minutes, at 4 ºC, using a biofuge stratus 230 V centrifuge (Thermo scientific, Germany).</p>
        <p>Both the soluble and pellet fractions were stored at -80 ºC for future analysis. Enzyme activities were measured in the cytosolic fraction. To determine SOD activity, the reduction of cytochrome c by the system xanthine oxidase/hypoxanthine was measured at 550nm (McCord &amp; Fridovich, 1969) and results expressed in U mg -1 of total protein concentration. CAT activity was determined by the decrease in absorbance at 240nm due to H2O2 consumption, with a molar extinction coefficient of 40 M -1 cm -1 (Greenwald, 1987) and results expressed as µmol min -1 mg -1 of total protein concentration. GPX activity was measured through NADPH oxidation in the presence of excess glutathione reductase, reduced glutathione and hydroperoxide as substrate, at 340nm (Lawrence &amp; Burk, 1978) and results expressed as nmol min -1 mg -1 of total protein concentration. GST activity was measured by the conjugation of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) with reduced glutathione (GSH) and the increase of absorbance measured at 340 nm (Ԑ 340 (CDNB) = 9.6 mM -1 cm -1 ) (Habig et al., 1974). The results are expressed in µmol CDNB min -1 mg protein -1 .</p>
        <p>Before the analysis of oxidative damage, gills and digestive gland (6 replicates of individual tissues per treatment) were weighed and rapidly buffered in 0.02M Tris-HCl (0.1 M HCl, 0.2 M Tris, pH=8.6) (the tissue-to-buffer ratio was 1:3 wet weight tissue/volume of buffer). Then, 10 µl of BHT (Butylated hydroxytoluene) was added, per each ml of Tris-HCl [0.02M]. The samples were homogenized in an ice bath and centrifuged at 30000 g, for 45 minutes, at 4 ºC, using a biofuge stratus 230 V centrifuge (Thermo scientific, Germany). Both the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were stored at -80 ºC for future analysis. Lipid peroxidation (LPO) was quantified based on the method described by Erdelmeier et al. (1998) -determining malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxyalkenals (4-HNE) concentrations upon the decomposition by polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxides. The tissue supernatant (200 μL) was incubated at 45 ºC, for 60 minutes, with 650 μL of 1-methyl-2-phenylindone diluted in methanol and 150 μL of methanesulfonic acid. The absorbance was measured at 586 nm and LPO levels are expressed as nmol malondialdehyde (MDA) + 4-HNE g -1 per mg of protein.</p>
        <p>Gills (6 replicates of individual tissues per treatment) were homogenized on ice in five volumes of a Tris-HCl buffer (100 mM, pH 8.0) containing 10% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 12000g, for 30 minutes, at 4º C. Anti-cholinesterase activity was measured by the modified Ellman's colorimetric method (Ellman et al., 1961), assessed by the addition of Ellman's reagent -DTNB -using AChEI (acetylcholine) as substrate, for the estimation of respective thiocholine (ChE). The absorbance is measured, at 405 nm (coefficient of extinction of  = 13.6 mM -1 .cm -1 ), to estimate the amount of ChE liberated by the reaction, which is proportional to the AChE activity (Colovic et al., 2013). The results are expressed by nmol AChEI min -1 mg protein -1 .</p>
        <p>Genotoxicity was estimated using the comet assay in a slightly modified version of Singh et al. (1988) and described in Almeida et al. (2011). Microscopic slides were coated with 0.65% normal melting point agarose (NMA), in Tris-acetate EDTA. After collection, hemolymph cells were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 3 min (4 ºC), and the pellets with isolated cells suspended in 0.65% low melting point agarose (LMA) in Kenny' s salt solution, and casted on the microscope slides. Afterwards, the slides with the embedded cells were immersed in a lysis buffer (2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris, 1% Triton X-100, 10% Dimethylsulfoxide, 1% Sarcosil, pH 10, 4 ºC), for the diffusion of cellular components and DNA immobilization in agarose. Following the lysis step, slides were placed in an electrophoresis chamber containing electrophoresis buffer (300 mM NaOH, 1 mM EDTA, adjusted at pH 13, 4 ºC), gently submerged and left in this solution for 15 minutes, to permit DNA unwinding. The electrophoresis was carried out and, once concluded, the slides were removed and immersed in a neutralizing solution (0.4 mM Tris, pH 7.5) and rinsed with ultrapure water. Then, the slides were allowed to dry for 48 hours, from which the analysis in fluorescence microscope was possible. The slides were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1 mg mL -1 ) and the presence of comets analysed using an optical fluorescence microscope (Axiovert S100) coupled to a camera (Sony). Fifty randomly chosen cells for each slide (25 in each gel from each organism) of nine organisms were scored with the Komet 
            <rs type="version">5.5</rs> image analysis system (
            <rs type="creator">Kinetic Imaging Ltd</rs>) at a total magnification of x400. Different parameters of the comet, including the olive tail moment (OTM), comet tail length and amount of DNA in the comet tail (Tail DNA %) were measured, and results are expressed as mean ± STD.
        </p>
        <p>Statistical differences between treatments, time of exposure/depuration and tissues were assessed using parametric tests (two-way ANOVA, followed by the Tukey's test) and non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis, followed by multiple comparisons), after normality (Shapiro-Wilk W test) and homogeneity of variances verified (Levene's test).</p>
        <p>Principal component analysis (PCA) for gills and digestive gland was used to evaluate the influence of PS microplastics in the determined biomarkers, in exposed clams, along the period of exposure and assess the overall results. Statistical significance was defined at p &lt;0.05.</p>
        <p>PS microplastics characterization is summarized in Table 3. DLS measurements show that dh (hydrodynamic diameter) of PS microplastics is 18.4 ± 1.33 µm, which is similar to the size specified by the manufacturer. ζ -potential measurements show that PS microplastics have highest negative surface charge in seawater (-12.4 ± 2.36 mV) than in Milli-Q water (-52.6 ± 2.34 mV) (p &lt;0.05), showing the tendency of these PS microplastics to aggregate in seawater.</p>
        <p>Turbidity (C/C0) of PS microplastics suspension was measured to assess the sedimentation rate (SR) (Figure 1). The SR is faster during the first two hours, estimated from the initial 5% decrease in normalised particle turbidity and slows down after this period of time. No significant differences in turbidity decrease were observed between Mili-Q water (97.94%) and seawater (94.65 %) over time (24 h) (p &gt; 0.05). However, a sharp decrease in turbidity is observed in MQ water during the first 2 hours (1.68 x 10 -1 h -1) although higher when compared to seawater (1.04 x 10 -1 h -1 ) (p &lt;0.05), while for the last 22 hours there is a higher decrease in SR for MQ water (3.05 x 10 -4 h -1 ) compared to seawater (1.16 x 10 -3 h -1 ) indicating that, after the initial time, PS microplastics tend to sediment faster in natural seawater (p &lt; 0.05).</p>
        <p>The condition index at the beginning of the experiment (time 0) was 36.01 ± 4.04 %. No significant changes were observed between unexposed and exposed organisms after 14 days (unexposed: 33.05 ± 4.76 %; exposed: 31.53 ± 5.30 %; p&gt;0.05) and in the elimination period (unexposed: 31.31 ± 4.58 % exposed: 31.83 ± 4.72 %; p&gt;0.05), indicating that the organisms were in good health throughout the duration of the experiment.</p>
        <p>In order to corroborate the presence of PS in the clams exposed to the aquatic environment containing microplastic, optical microscopy and infrared data were analysed.</p>
        <p>The PS microplastics present in the hemolymph observed under the OM are in Figure 2. The presence of a small aggregate of PS microplastics is observed in image A and two polystyrene particles in image B (highlighted by circles) indicating that, like for seawater, there is a tendency for the PS microplastics to form small aggregates/agglomerates in the hemolymph.</p>
        <p>The diversity of the tissue samples implies variations of the infrared spectra from individual specimens in the same conditions. Moreover, due to the amount of PS microplastics expected to accumulate during a 14 days exposure, the spectral analysis is not intended as quantitative, but only as a proof of detection of PS in the gills and digestive gland of the clams. It consisted in a comparison of the average spectra of unexposed clams with clams exposed to PS microplastics.</p>
        <p>In Figure 3, the DRIFT spectra of digestive gland and gills from clams not exposed to PS microplastics (DG T0 and Gills T0, respectively) are compared to that of digestive gland from specimens into which microplastics were directly added in vitro, in a known amount (50 µl). The spectrum of the same PS microplastics is also included in Figure 3 for comparison. In order to allow the comparison of the relative intensities of the bands, the spectra were normalized to the amide II mode (C-N stretching), at 1543 cm -1 (Matthäus et al., 2008), common to all of them, and not overlapped with any PS band or the water deformation mode. The average spectra of the digestive gland and gills are similar, with some features specific to the gills: a small band at 3060 cm -1 , a clear splitting of the bands at 1082/1047 cm -1 and at 609/588 cm -1 . On the other hand, the region below 1200 cm -1 is much stronger (relatively to the amide II band) for the digestive gland. The average spectrum of digestive gland with added microplastics (DG Added PS) shows a general increase of relative intensities in the regions overlapped with PS bands; new small bands appear at 696 and 737 cm -1 that may be assigned to the strongest bands of the polymer, slightly shifted due to interactions with the specimen tissues. In the spectrum of PS microplastic these bands appear at 700 and 756 cm -1 , and are related to out of plane C-H deformation modes of the benzene rings (Holland-Moritz &amp; Siesler, 1976;Koenig, 1999;Liang &amp; Krimm, 1958).</p>
        <p>The average DRIFT spectra of samples obtained before exposure to PS microplastics (T0) were compared to those exposed for 14 days (T14) and after 7 depuration days (T21) (Figures 4A andC for gills and digestive gland, respectively). Both for gills and digestive gland the spectral region where PS absorbs mostly is stronger after the exposure period and decreases during depuration, not achieving the initial relative intensities.</p>
        <p>The spectral subtractions (T14-T0) and (T21-T0) were calculated and compared to the spectrum of PS microplasctics (Figures 4B andD for gills and digestive gland, respectively). The differences (T14-T0) are generally positive for both tissues, evidencing the accumulation of PS microplastics during exposure. For the gills, the region where PS absorbs more strongly (below 1000 cm -1 ) corresponds to larger differences between T14 and T0, and some relative maxima observed in the high wavenumber region are coincident with (or slightly shifted from) PS bands. For the digestive gland, clear maxima in T14-T0 differences are coincident with PS bands, at 1725, 1590, 1435, 1360 and 1275 cm -1 . In the low wavenumber region, the spectra at 0 and 14 days are both strong, rendering the definition of eventual PS bands more difficult. A partial elimination of PS during the depuration period is unambiguous from the spectral differences (T21-T0) that remain positive for both tissues, although smaller than (T14-T0).</p>
        <p>The antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GPx) and GST activities in the gills and digestive gland of S. plana are presented in Figure 5. Only CAT shows a tissue specific response with higher activity in the digestive gland when compared to the gills (p &lt;0.05).</p>
        <p>In the gills, the exposure to PS microplastics induces a significant increase in SOD activity after 7 days of exposure that continues in the depuration period (p&lt;0.05) (Figure 5A), while for CAT activity there was a significant increase only after three days of exposure (p&lt;0.05)(Figure 5B). Similarly, in PS exposed clams, GPx activity increases in clams exposed to PS microplastics after the 3 rd day of exposure (p &lt;0.05) and similarly to SOD, GPx continues to increase at the end of the depuration period (p &lt;0.05) (Figure 5C). Moreover, exposure to PS microplastics induces an enhancement of GST activity at the end of the exposure period (p &lt;0.05), but it decreases in the depuration period (p &lt;0.05) (Figure 5D).</p>
        <p>In the digestive gland, the SOD activity, like in the gills, increases with time of exposure, but this increase was only significant at the end of the exposure period (day 14, p &lt;0.05). Similarly to the gills, SOD activity in the digestive gland also increases at the end of the depuration period (p &lt;0.05) (Figure 5E). On the other hand, CAT activity in PS contaminated clams decreased (p &lt;0.05) with no differences in the depuration period (p &gt;0.05) (Figure 5F). GPx activity, however, showed a bell shape behaviour with a significant increase after the 3 rd day of exposure and a decrease in the remaining period (Figure 5G). In clams exposed to PS microplastics, GST activity only significantly decreased after the 3 rd day of exposure (p &lt;0.05). This decrease was similar at the end of the depuration period (p &lt;0.05) (Figure 5H).</p>
        <p>Genotoxic effects for both treatments (CTR and PS exposed clams), analysed by the comet assay and expressed as % of tail DNA and Olive Tail Moment are in Figure 6A-B, respectively. No significant changes were observed for the % of tail and OTM between controls and exposed clams except for day 7 where a significant increase occurred for OTM in exposed clams (p &lt;0.05). In the depuration period, significant differences were detected between control and clams previously exposed to PS microplastics (p &lt;0.05) for both parameters.</p>
        <p>The activity of AChE in the gills is in Figure 7. In PS exposed group the AChE activity significantly decreased (p &lt;0.05) on day 3 when compared to T0. AChE activity was also significantly lower on day 3 and 14 of exposure and after the depuration period, when compared to non-exposed clams (p &lt;0.05).</p>
        <p>LPO levels were significantly higher in the digestive gland then in the gills ((p &lt;0.05; Figure 8A-B). In the gills of PS exposed clams, although LPO levels remained unchanged through time, they significantly decreased compared to those at the beginning of the experiment (day 0) and to the other sampling days (p &lt;0.05) while in the digestive gland, in PS exposed clams, LPO levels significantly increased after 7 days of exposure compared to controls (p &lt;0.05). In the elimination period, in the digestive gland of PS exposed clams LPO levels significantly decreased when compared to controls (p &lt;0.05).</p>
        <p>PCA was applied to all the data for the gills and digestive gland to explain the effects of PS microplastics on biomarkers responses (Figure 9). Regarding the gills, the two principal components represent 72.7 % of total variance, with PC1 representing 53.4 % and PC2 19.3 % (Figure 9 A). PCA indicates a clear separation between the initial time of the experiment (T0) and the remaining days, between exposed clams and controls and also a clear separation of the depuration period in exposed clams (T21) comparing to others. SOD, CAT, GPx and the genotoxic parameters are in the positive part of PC1, closely related with PS exposed clams, principally after 7 days of exposure (MICR 7).</p>
        <p>LPO and AChE are negatively related to the other biomarkers in PC1 and are more influenced by non-exposed clams. In PC2, SOD, LPO, AChE and genotoxicity are in the negative part, with SOD and genotoxic parameters being more influenced by exposed clams on day 7 and after depuration (MICR 21). CAT, GPx and GST are in the positive part of PC2, with particularly GST being more influenced by exposed organisms at days 3 and 14.</p>
        <p>In the digestive gland, the two principal components represent 75.2 % of total variance, with PC1 representing 53.4 % and PC2 21.8 % (Figure 9 B). In this case, there is a clear separation between unexposed and exposed clams, where all the non-exposed clams are in the positive part of the PC1. SOD and the genotoxic parameters are in the negative part of PC1 and more related to exposed clams at days 7 and 14 together with the MICR 21, while CAT, GPx, GST and LPO are on the positive side and more related to non-exposed clams. PC2 clearly isolates exposed clams at day 3 (MICR 3) from the rest, although exposed clams from day 7 also fall in the negative part of PC2. Also in the negative part of PC2 are LPO and GPx, with GST, CAT and SOD and Tail DNA in the positive side.</p>
        <p>The presence and mode of action of polystyrene microparticles in the gills and digestive gland of the peppery furrow shell S. plana and the potential ecotoxicological risk of this emerging contaminant was evaluated by characterizing the type of microplastics used and identifying their presence using infrared spectroscopy in diffuse reflectance mode, and by assessing their effects using a battery of biomarkers. These biomarkers were chosen to evaluate the possible effects that come from the physical damage caused by the microparticles, namely: oxidative stress and oxidative damage (through enzymatic activity and LPO), which in turn can lead to genotoxicity and/or neurotoxicity (analysed through the comet assay and the AChE activity).</p>
        <p>One of the questions that arise from laboratory experiments is whether they are able to really mimic the natural environment (Phuong et al., 2016) in terms of environmental relevant exposure concentrations. Higher concentrations of microplastics have been found in sediments, 3.3 particles g -1 (Rhine estuary; Leslie et al., 2013) or 62 particles g -1 (Wadden sea islands; Liebezeit &amp; Dubaish, 2012). A major concern is the lack of information on the environmental concentrations for plastic particles smaller than 50 µm, with only a few exceptions reported and where it was noted that the smaller particles were much more abundant than the larger ones (Song et al., 2014). For these reasons, it was considered that the concentration of 1 mg L -1 (4 particles ml -1 ) was a good compromise between measured environmental concentrations taking into account, both the water and sediment compartments, acknowledging also the lack of data on the concentration for smaller sized particles and their potential to exist in the environment in higher concentrations than those currently detected for larger particles.</p>
        <p>The combination of multiple analytical techniques (OM, DLS, ELS) to characterize PS microplastics using both natural seawater and ultrapure water (Milli-Q) (Table 3 andFigure 1) provide an insight about the hazard and risk of these microparticles in the aquatic environment. Size and density are important proxies for microplastics bioavailability that can also be enhanced by biological factors (Wright et al., 2013b). The PS microplastics used had a density of 1.09 g/cm 3 and took 24 hours to sediment. Data indicated that the particles start reaching the bottom after 2 hours of exposure and thus are available to the organisms present therein. The PS microparticles used in this assay are spherical in shape and of the same size (20 µm) and tend to form small aggregates in seawater (Table 3). Similarly, the ingestion of PS spheres (100 nm) in suspension-feeders bivalve molluscs increased when they were fed with microplastics aggregates generated manually in the laboratory (Wright et al., 2013a). Therefore it is hypothesised that the effects of PS microplastics might be caused by the formation of aggregates when accumulated in clam tissues, although it could be different if the microparticles were heterogeneous and not of the same shape and size (Frias, 2015). Most of the microplastics found in the marine environment are secondary microplastics, resulting from the degradation of larger pieces, and thus, with different sizes, shape and sharp edges, that may contribute to injuries in the digestive tract (Browne et al., 2008;von Moos et al., 2012).</p>
        <p>S. plana is able to accumulate PS microplastics from seawater in the gills and digestive gland (Figures 3 and4). Bivalves are able to select particles before ingestion but not after ingestion (Wright et al., 2013b). The presence of microplastics in the gills was noted after 14 days of exposure, with a partial recovery during the depuration period. This suggests that PS microplastics are trapped in this organ, the first in contact with the polymer. The microparticles are also ingested through the inhalant siphon and subsequently transported to the mouth and to the digestive gland for intracellular digestion (Hughes, 1969). This was noted by the presence of PS microparticles in S. plana digestive gland (Figures 4 C-D), where they are likely not digested, and some of them were eliminated. The presence of small aggregates of microplastics in the haemolymph (Figure 2) indicates that PS microplastics were transported into the circulatory system, indicating a possible translocation, where they can be retained for several weeks and then transported to several tissues where they can cause harm. But, the question is if the translocation really occurred or was it a contamination by microplastic while sampling haemolymph? Lambert et al. (2014) discuss whether the presence of microplastics in the circulatory system is due to translocation or contamination due to sampling technique. PS microplastics in M. edulis persisted in the circulatory system for 48 days (Browne et al., 2008), giving an evidence of microplastic translocation. The accumulation, upon ingestion, of 2 µm and 4-16 µm PS fluorescently labelled microplastics (0.51 µg L -1 ) in the gut cavity and digestive tubules of Mytilus edulis was also observed by Browne et al. (2008), after 12 hours of exposure. The same author identified PS microparticles in the haemolymph and haemocytes of the same mussel species although no toxicity effects were observed. Conversely, in mussels exposed for 48h to microplastics (1-80 µm) an increase in haemocytes and a decrease in lysosomal membrane stability was observed in the same mussel species, indicating the presence of an inflammatory process (Bowmer &amp; Kershaw, 2010). Also, von Moos et al. (2012) shows that HDPE particles (0-80 µm) were transported to the digestive gland where they accumulated in the lysosomal system of M. edulis. However, in oysters C. gigas exposed to fluorescent microplastic beads (of 2 and 6 µm), microplastics were only present in the digestive gland (Sussarellu et al., 2016), existing no evidence of transfer from the digestive track to the circulatory system.</p>
        <p>Although there is some controversy about the translocation of microplastic in the haemolymph of bivalve molluscs, the data reported is only on filter-feeders (Browne et al., 2008;von Moos et al., 2012). It might occur that in the case of suspension-feeders like S. plana, microplastics tend to translocate in the circulatory system but this needs to be confirmed in future studies. In S. plana exposed to gold nanoparticles (Au NPs), nanoparticles were accumulated almost exclusively in the digestive gland, although they were also present in gills. These results highlight the accumulation of both nano and microparticles essentially in the digestive tract of this clam species. The accumulation of microplastics in this tissue might impair the digestive system with a consequent decrease of feeding behaviour. There is very limited information regarding the capacity of aquatic organisms to eliminate microplastics. The present results indicated that after a week of depuration, microplastics were still present in both tissues (Figure 4). Future studies that quantify the amount of microplastics accumulated in clam tissues and assess whether microplastics are eliminated in the pseudo-faeces of S. plana are necessary, in order to increase the knowledge about the accumulation, metabolism and elimination of PS microplastics in this species.</p>
        <p>A battery of biomarkers was used to assess the biological effects and toxicity of PS microplastics in the gills and digestive gland of S. plana. Results indicate an oxidative stress response in gills and digestive gland cells that are tissue and exposure time dependent (Figures 5A-E). SOD is the first defence line to protect these tissues against oxidative stress probably caused by injuries of PS microplastics in the tissues. SOD activity enhanced in both tissues in the presence of PS microplastics reflects the need to balance the excess of superoxide radical (O2 • -) into the less damaging hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and thus, contribute to prevent cellular oxidative damage (Jo et al., 2008). The same response occurred in marine mussels Mytilus spp. exposed to 32 µg L -1 of PS microplastics (2 and 6 µm) after 14 days (Paul-Pont et al., 2016). CAT is involved in the removal of H2O2 -the main precursor of hydroxyl radical in aquatic organisms -and acts as a defence mechanism toward the exogenous source of H2O2 (Regoli &amp; Giuliani, 2014). However, CAT activity was only enhanced in the gills after three days of exposure and inhibited in the digestive gland after 7 days of exposure (Figure 5B, F) and is apparently not the antioxidant defence mechanism used by S. plana to respond to PS microplastics toxicity. Avio et al. (2015) also noted an inhibition of CAT activity in the digestive tissue of the marine mussel M. galloprovincialis exposed to microplastics. CAT and GPx are both involved in the removal of H2O2. Regarding GPx, an increase in activity after 3 days of exposure, suggests a defence mechanism, but the posterior reduction in GPx activity, particularly in the digestive gland (Figure 5G), may be an indication of an inhibition triggered by excess of ROS and the incapacity to deal with the negative effect of this stressor. Glutathione peroxidases are known to be particularly sensitive in revealing the early onset of a pro-oxidant challenge, even at low levels of environmental disturbance (Regoli &amp; Giuliani, 2014). In S. plana exposed to mercury, a decrease in GPx activity in the whole soft tissues occurred due to the higher toxicity of mercury (Ahmad et al., 2011). Such ROS perturbations were also observed in mussels (M. galloprovincialis) exposed to PS and PE microplastics alone or in combination with pyrene (Avio et al., 2015). The pro-oxidant challenge induced by microplastics on mussels was supported by the lack of significant variation of malondialdehyde, lipofuscin and neutral lipids in digestive tissues.</p>
        <p>The ROS production led to an inhibition of CAT and Se-GPx in M. galloprovincialis exposed to PS and PE microplastics (Avio et al., 2015). Browne et al. (2013) showed that PVC microparticles induced an oxyradical production in Arenicola marina, and lugworms that ingested sediments with PVC reduce the capacity by more than 30% to deal with oxidative stress. PS microbeads also led to an increase in ROS production in haemocytes and to the enhancement of anti-oxidant and glutathione-related enzymes in mussel tissues (Paul-Pont et al., 2016).</p>
        <p>GST is usually associated with phase II biotransformation, involved in the metabolism of lipophilic organic compounds by catalysing the conjugation of the reduced form of glutathione (GSH) to xenobiotic substrates, and has also a protective role against oxidative stress (Lesser, 2006). S. plana may be using this detoxification mechanism to deal with the exposure to PS microplastics, by catalysing the conjugation of the reduced form of glutathione (GSH) to xenobiotic substrates, playing a significant role in the detoxification of the reactive products from lipid peroxidation (Lesser, 2006). Gills showed an increase in GST activity after 14 days of exposure (Figure 5D). Similar results were found in gills of M. galloprovincialis after exposure to organic persistent pollutants, such as pp'DDE (2,2-bis-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichlorethylene) (Hoarau et al., 2002;Khessiba et al., 2001). In the digestive gland, GST activity decreased (Figure 5H), as was previously observed in mussels after PS-exposure for 14 days (Avio et al., 2015).</p>
        <p>In the depuration period, SOD activity continued to increase in both organs (Figure 5A,E). The increase in enzymatic activity at the end of the depuration period can be due to an impairment of the filtration activity or to the presence of remaining microparticles in the gills and digestive gland, that still induce an enzymatic response (Paul-Pont et al., 2016), suggesting the inability of S. plana to eliminate microplastics, by the mechanical damage caused by the release of the particles from the tissues, or even the lack of capacity to recover after this elimination period. Nevertheless, 7 days of depuration might not be enough for S. plana to completely recover from the exposure of PS microplastics as suggested by the present results (Figure 5). In conclusion, it can be hypothesized that ROS are produced as a result of PS microplastics uptake, and possibly cause injury of gills and/or internalization in the digestive gland cells, since it is known that these microparticles are able to cross cell membranes, leading to cell damage (Browne et al., 2008;Rosenkranz et al., 2009;Van Cauwenberghe et al., 2015).</p>
        <p>The levels of oxidative damage to lipids decreased in the gills in the PS exposed clams (Figure 8A). This could be linked to antioxidant defences, which consequently limit the attack of ROS to membrane lipids. In the digestive gland, there is a tendency of LPO levels to increase (from day 0 to day 7), but no significant differences were noted (Figure 8B). The enzymatic activities measured in this tissue were always lower on day 7, with a recovery after one week of depuration, with the exception of GPx. A significant enhancement of ROS in digestive gland haemocytes of Mytilus spp. after 7 days of micro-PS exposure (mixture of 2 and 6 µm) was previously reported but no antioxidant markers were activated and no sign of lipid peroxidation was observed (Paul-Pont et al., 2016). Ahmad et al. (2011) showed an increase in LPO levels in both gills and digestive gland of S. plana exposed to mercury. When enzymatic defences do not actively respond to the presence of PS microplastics this may result in an inflammation response and a lysosomal membrane destabilization, as a cellular response observed in mussels (M. edulis) exposed to 2.5 g L -1 of a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) particles (&gt; 0-80 µm) for 96 hours (von Moos et al., 2012). Future exposure experiments with S. plana should look at this aspect.</p>
        <p>The Comet assay is a sensitive, rapid and economic technique for the detection of DNA strand breaks and can be regarded as a good method to assess genotoxicity in aquatic species (Jha, 2008). Moreover, Petridis et al. (2009) demonstrated that the blood cells of S. plana are suitable for screening genotoxic effects, using this method. DNA strand breaks induced in PS exposed haemocytes of S. plana (Figure 6 A,B) are similar to mussels treated with PE microplastics where a significant enhancement of DNA strand breaks was detected (Avio et al., 2015). Regarding the elimination period, there was an increase of both Tail DNA (%) and OTM, in PS exposed organisms. The mechanism of genotoxicity of PS microplastics remains unknown, but it is suggested that it can be related to ROS production and oxidative stress, not handled by the antioxidant defence mechanism, as occurs with nanoparticles (Rocha et al., 2014). Hence, causing damage by covalently binding to DNA (Hossain &amp; Huq, 2002) or by inhibiting DNA synthesis (Hidalgo &amp; Dominguez, 1998) and thus preventing cell division and DNA replication (Singh et al., 1988).</p>
        <p>PS microplastics inhibit the AChE activity in clam gills at different times of exposure with this effect remaining even after 7 days of depuration (Figure 7). The ability of microplastics to inhibit AChE activity was previously described in juveniles of the common goby Pomatoschistus microps exposed to 18.4 and 184 µg L -1 of PE microspheres (1-5 µm) for 96 hours, alone or in combination with pyrene (Oliveira et al., 2013) or in combination with chromium (Luís et al., 2015).</p>
        <p>PCA for the gills and digestive gland show different responses that reflect the distinct physiological and metabolic functions of the two tissues (Figure 9A-B). Exposure to PS microplastics in the gills was positively related to an increase in the activity of oxidative stress enzymes and DNA damage, although negatively related to the oxidative damage and to the activity of AChE (inhibition), meaning that there is an inflammation process and a neurotoxic effect and validating the hypothesis that gills had a more effective response against oxidative stress than digestive gland (Figure 9A). In the case of the digestive gland, SOD is the biomarker that best relates to exposure to PS microplastics. As gills are the main tissue involved in filtration, they are in direct contact with the PS microplastics, being more susceptible to oxidative stress than the digestive gland (Figure 9B). Despite existing data about the increasing occurrence of PS microplastics in the marine environment (Andrady, 2011;Cole et al., 2011;Wright et al., 2013b), there is still much to understand about their biological effects. Further studies are needed to investigate the capacity to recover from the potential effects of PS and other microplastics in marine organisms beyond 7 days of depuration. The evaluation of the biological effects of microplastics also requires a molecular-level to understand how they interact with cells in a physiological environment, but up to date the functional implications at cellular level still remains to be elucidated.</p>
        <p>PS microplastics were taken up by clams, mainly by the gills where they tend to accumulate, but they were also present in the digestive gland where they seemed to be stored. Tissue-specific sensibility is involved in the clams response to PS exposure by inducing oxidative stress, with the gills providing a more effective response than digestive gland. The genotoxicity of PS microplastics increased with time. Furthermore, the detoxification process of PS microplastics in clams tissues was inefficient for the 7 days duration tested, indicating their potential trophic transfer.</p>
