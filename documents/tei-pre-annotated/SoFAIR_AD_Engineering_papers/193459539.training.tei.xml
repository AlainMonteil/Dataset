        <p>In recent years, several numbers of nature inspired optimization techniques have been developed. These include Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Gravitational Search algorithm (GSA), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Evolutionary Algorithm (EA), Deferential Evolution (DE), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Biogeographically Based Optimization (BBO), Firefly algorithm (FA), and Bat algorithm (BA). The common goal of these algorithms is to find the best quality of solutions and better convergence performance.

        <p>Exploitation is the convergence capability to the most excellent result of the function near a good result and exploration is the capability of a variant to find whole parts of function area. Finally the goal of all nature inspired variants is to balance the capability of exploration and exploitation capably in order to search best global optimal solution in the search space. As per Eiben and Schippers [1], exploitation and exploration in nature inspired computing are not understandable due to lack of a usually accepted opinion and on the other side, with increase in one capability, the other will weaken and vice versa.Exploitation is the convergence capability to the most excellent result of the function near a good result and exploration is the capability of a variant to find whole parts of function area.

        <p>The PSO algorithm was firstly introduced by Kennedy and Eberhart in [32] and its fundamental judgment was primarily inspired by the simulation of the social behavior of animals such as bird flocking and fish schooling. While searching for food, the birds are either scattered or go together before they settle on the position where they can find the food. While the birds are searching for food from one position to another, there is always a bird that can smell the food very well; that is, the bird is aware of the position where the food can be found, having the correct food resource message. Because they are transmitting the message, particularly the useful message at any period while searching for the food from one position to another, the birds will finally flock to the position where food can be found. This approach is learned from animal's behavior to calculate global optimization functions/problems and every partner of the swarm/crowd is called a particle. In PSO technique, the position of each partner of the crowd in the global search space is updated by two mathematical equations.

        <p>In GWO, the crowd is split into four different groups such as alpha, beta, delta, and omega which are employed for simulating the leadership hierarchy. Grey wolf belongs to Canidae family. Grey wolves are measured as apex predators, meaning that they are at the top of the food chain. Grey wolves mostly prefer to live in a pack. The leaders are a female and a male known as alphas. The alpha (𝛼) is generally liable for making decisions about sleeping, time to wake, hunting, and so on.In GWO, the crowd is split into four different groups such as alpha, beta, delta, and omega which are employed for simulating the leadership hierarchy.

        <p>In this text, we hybridize Particle Swarm Optimization with Grey Wolf Optimizer algorithm using low-level coevolutionary mixed hybrid. The hybrid is low level because we merge the functionalities of both variants. It is coevolutionary because we do not use both variants one after the other. In other ways, they run in parallel. It is mixed because there are two distinct variants that are involved in generating final solutions of the problems. On the basis of this modification, we improve the ability of exploitation in Particle Swarm Optimization with the ability of exploration in Grey Wolf Optimizer to produce both variants' strength.In this text, we hybridize Particle Swarm Optimization with Grey Wolf Optimizer algorithm using low-level coevolutionary mixed hybrid.

        <p>Firstly, we tested the ability of HPSOGWO, PSO, and GWO variant that were run 30 times on each unimodal function. The HPSOGWO, GWO, and PSO algorithms have to be run at least more than ten times to search for the best Parameter space numerical or statistical solutions. It is again a general method that an algorithm is run on a test problem many times and the best optimal solutions, mean and standard deviation of the superior obtained results in the last generation, are evaluated as metrics of performance. The performance of proposed hybrid variant is compared to PSO and GWO variant in terms of best optimal and statistical results. Similarly the convergence performances of HPSOGWO, PSO, and GWO variant have been compared on the basis of graph; see Figures 1(a)-1(g). On the basis of obtained results and convergence performance of the variants, we concluded that HPSOGWO is more reliable in giving superior quality results with reasonable iterations and avoids premature convergence of the search process to local optimal point and provides superior exploration of the search course. Further, we noted that the unimodal problems are suitable for standard exploitation. Therefore, these results prove the superior performance of HPSOGWO in terms of exploiting the optimum.Firstly, we tested the ability of HPSOGWO, PSO, and GWO variant that were run 30 times on each unimodal function.

It is again a general method that an algorithm is run on a test problem many times and the best optimal solutions, mean and standard deviation of the superior obtained results in the last generation, are evaluated as metrics of performance. The performance of proposed hybrid variant is compared to PSO and GWO variant in terms of best optimal and statistical results. Similarly the convergence performances of HPSOGWO, PSO, and GWO variant have been compared on the basis of graph; see Figures 1(a)-1(g). On the basis of obtained results and convergence performance of the variants, we concluded that HPSOGWO is more reliable in giving superior quality results with reasonable iterations and avoids premature convergence of the search process to local optimal point and provides superior exploration of the search course. Further, we noted that the unimodal problems are suitable for standard exploitation. Therefore, these results prove the superior performance of HPSOGWO in terms of exploiting the optimum.</p>
        <p>Secondly, the performance of the proposed hybrid variant has been tested on six multimodal benchmark functions. In contrast to the multimodal problems, unimodal benchmark problems have many local optima with the number rising exponentially with dimension. This makes them appropriate for benchmarking the exploration capability of an approach. The numerical and statistical results obtained from HPSOGWO, PSO, and GWO algorithms are shown in Tables 6 and7.Secondly, the performance of the proposed hybrid variant has been tested on six multimodal benchmark functions.

        <p>Experimental results show that the proposed variant finds a superior quality of solution without trapping in local maximum and to attain faster convergence performance; see Figures 2(a)-2(f), respectively. This approach outperforms GWO and PSO variants on the majority of the multimodal benchmark functions.

        <p>Thirdly, the suitable solutions of fixed-dimension multimodal benchmark functions are illustrated in Tables 8 and9. The fixed dimensional benchmark functions have many local optima with the number growing exponentially with dimension. This makes them fitting for benchmarking the exploration capacity of a variant. Experimental numerical and statistical solutions have shown that the proposed variant is able to find superior quality of results on maximum number of fixed dimensional multimodal benchmark functions as compared to PSO and GWO variants. Further, the convergence performance of these variants has been plotted in Figures 3(a)-3(j).

        <p>Finally, the accuracy of the newly hybrid approach has been verified using starting and ending time of the CPU (TIC and TOC), CPU time, and clock.

        <p>To sum up, all simulation results assert that the HPSOGWO algorithm is very helpful in improving the efficiency of the PSO and GWO in terms of result quality as well as computational efforts.To sum up, all simulation results assert that the HPSOGWO algorithm is very helpful in improving the efficiency of the PSO and GWO in terms of result quality as well as computational efforts.</p>
