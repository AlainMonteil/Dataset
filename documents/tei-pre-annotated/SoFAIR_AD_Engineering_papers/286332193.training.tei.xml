        <p>Nowadays, three-dimensional printing is one of the fastest developing branch of technology, art and science, and still broadens the applications. The term three-dimensional printing was defined by International Standard Organization (ISO) as: Bfabrication of objects through the deposition of a material using a print head, nozzle, or another printer technology^. In contrast to commonly used subtractive and formative manufacturing methodologies, this technique is one of the methods of additive manufacturing (AM) in which the parts are prepared from 3D model data in the process of joining materials layer by layer. The practical approach of AM is called rapid prototyping (RP) (1) and its advantages include the reduction of prototyping time and costs, easy modifications of a product at a designed level, the possibility of manufacturing of small objects, individualized product series or structures impossible to be formed with subtractive techniques (2).Nowadays, three-dimensional printing is one of the fastest developing branch of technology, art and science, and still broadens the applications.

        <p>The idea of 3DP has evolved from early 70′ of the twentieth century when Pierre A. L. Ciraud described the method of application of powdered material and subsequent solidification of each layer through the action of high energy beam. In this case meltable materials such as plastics or metals can be theoretically used for object preparation. In early 80′ in a patent entitles: BA molding process for forming a threedimensional article in layers^, Ross Housholder described an idea of sand binding by different materials and Carl Deckard developed a method of solidification of powdered bed by laser beam called selective laser sintering (SLS).The idea of 3DP has evolved from early 70′ of the twentieth century when Pierre A.

        <p>The first 3DP method used in the development of pharmaceutical dosage forms was based on the idea presented in patent entitled BThree-dimensional printing techniques^ (3). The printing process mode of action is similar to desktop inkjet printers and is called drop on solid deposition -DOS or powder bed jetting. Droplets of ink sprayed from print head bind the layer of free powder bed while unbound powder particles act as a support material preventing from collapsing of overhang or porous structures. After each step the formed object is lowered and a layer of free powder is applied by roller or powder jetting system and process is proceeded (Fig. 6).The first 3DP method used in the development of pharmaceutical dosage forms was based on the idea presented in patent entitled BThree-dimensional printing techniques^ (3).

        <p>The first printers were equipped with commercially available thermal or piezoelectric print heads that delivered bonding agent. Active pharmaceutical ingredients as well as modifying agents can be either dissolved or dispersed in ink or distributed in powder bed. This method was used due to its similarity to classical formulation processes as wet granulation and the ability to apply the excipients commonly used in the field of pharmaceutical technology, especially in solid dosage form formulations. One of the advantage of this method is possibility of precise location of exact dose of drug or modifying excipients within powdered bed to obtain several compartments with different composition or mode of action. The product quality attributes are influenced by powder and ink properties. The layer height is mainly influenced by particle size and flowability of powder bed as well as cohesion force between particles and part of the printer or powder wettability. Lower layer height and subsequent layer application result in more detailed and precise fabrication of objects with minor mass and dose variations. The ink constituents as solvents, APIs or modifying excipient can change viscosity, droplet size and influence the efficiency of powder binding. The process parameters as printing speed, droplet volume, distance from powder bed also play an important role in the product development and can have an impact on the powder bonding especially between layers in Z axis. They may negatively affect the mechanical strength of the printlets. After printing, additional steps as drying, residual solvents and unbound powder removal should be performed. The DOS method was used in preparation of various solid systems such as implants with levofloxacin (16) or in combination with rifampicine (41), rifampicine and isoniazid (42) exhibiting modified or pulsatile release of APIs. The chlorpheniramine tablets with modified release () and acetaminophen tablets with linear release profiles () were developed as well.The first printers were equipped with commercially available thermal or piezoelectric print heads that delivered bonding agent.

        <p>The DOS method is suitable for preparation of easily disintegrating tablet with porous structure. The development in this filed have led to the commercialization of ZipDose ® technology by Aprecia ® Pharmaceuticals and the first 3D-printed drug Spritam ® which was approved in 2015 by FDA (43). The orodispersible tablets which disintegrate within seconds in aqueous solution contain antiepileptic drug levetiracetam. In case of orodispersible tablets high dose of APIs usually results in technological problems in manufacturing and quality control (44). Application of 3DP techniques allowed to prepare fast disintegration tablets with dose up to 1000 mg (45).The DOS method is suitable for preparation of easily disintegrating tablet with porous structure.

        <p>Example of Spritam ® showed that DOS can be used in a large scale manufacturing of highly porous ODTs. Nevertheless, preparation of multicomponent modified release tables on large production scale with sufficient repeatability of quality attributes can be challenging with regard to more dense structure of this tablets compared to ODT. Variations in porosity resulted from the differences in adhesion between layers can influence the APIs dissolution profile. The application of higher amount of binder prolongs drying time and increases the risk of limited removal of residual solvent.Example of Spritam ® showed that DOS can be used in a large scale manufacturing of highly porous ODTs.

        <p>A powder can be also solidified by applying the beam of high energy. The basic construction assumptions of selective laser sintering or selective laser melting (SLM) are similar to DOS method. Powdered bed is transferred from one compartment to another by levelling system and layers are formed by sintering (heating just below melting temperature) or melting the polymeric or metallic powdered bed by laser beam (Fig. 7).A powder can be also solidified by applying the beam of high energy.

Powdered bed is transferred from one compartment to another by levelling system and layers are formed by sintering (heating just below melting temperature) or melting the polymeric or metallic powdered bed by laser beam (Fig. 7).</p>
        <p>In this process the high energy beam is created usually by laser and applied power varies depending on powder properties. While 5 W laser is sufficient in case of polyamide, even 1 kW laser is required for metal melting. Powder bed must be heated before printing in the printer chamber to the temperature adequate to the process parameters. After printing the fabricated objects are imbedded in powder and the bed should be slowly cooled down to avoid stress. These steps are time consuming and depends on printer chamber volume. Another drawback is the risk of API decomposition after exposure to laser beam. Despite all the disadvantages, the SLS method is under consideration as a way of solid dosage form formulation. Fina et al. () used SLS for preparation of paracetamol tablet with Kollicoat ® IR or Eudragit ® L100-55. Additionally, Candurin ® gold sheen was added to aid the sintering process. The produced printlets were characterized by good mechanical properties -low friability in the range of 0.02-0.56% and high crushing strength -from 284 N to over 485 N. The drug content was equal to the theoretical value. The pH-independent release characteristics with the release rate dependent on the drug content were observed for Kollicoat ® -based formulations whereas Eudragit®-based formulations showed pH-dependent and modified-release profiles not correlated with the drug loading. The application of another polymers i.e. hydroxypropyl methylcellulose or Kollidon ® VA 64 and optimization of printing parameters influenced printlets characteristics. Increased laser scanner speed resulted in more porous structure and decreased mechanical strength. In case of Kollidon ® VA 64 printlets showed fast dissolution characteristics (over 90% after 5 min) and rapid disintegration time -4 s (7). SLS technology can be a promising method to obtain porous, rapid disintegrating as well as modified release dosage forms without binding agent. The decomposition of APIs may be induced by high energy beam especially during preparation of more dense form. The stability issues and production time seem to be important challenges in SLS application. Sintering speed influencing the porosity of the printlets and effectiveness of printing process can be increased by multiplication of laser beams like in metal sintering 3D printers.In this process the high energy beam is created usually by laser and applied power varies depending on powder properties.

        <p>The idea of object manufacturing by solidification of liquid is similar to powder solidification technique. Droplets of Binkŝ prayed from the nozzle are deposited on the thin layers and cured by cooling air or in presence of high energy light. Due to the absence of powdered bed the drop on drop (DOD) or Polyjet technology requires the use of additional material to create support for overhang geometries. The print head moves along X and Y axes during printing, the print platform bed is lowered along Z axis by the height of the layer after the deposition of each layer of the material (Fig. 8). Different technical solutions applied in this technique resulted in possibility of multi-material full-color printing.The idea of object manufacturing by solidification of liquid is similar to powder solidification technique.

        <p>The quality of printed product as well as curing method depend on properties of spraying material. The first materials used in this techniques were waxes. In pharmaceutical technology they were used in modified release dosage form formulation and at present time also found application in 3DP technology. Molten wax was sprayed on build platform in heated chamber to prevent rapid solidification. Matrix tablets containing beeswax and fenofibrate were prepared by Kyobula et al. (11) by means of 3D material jetting of molten wax and the influence of bespoke geometries (honeycomb architecture with different infill ratio) on dissolution profile was revealed. The cell diameter of the honeycomb geometry and material wettability were found to affect the dissolution profile from tablets of constant weight. The amount of released drug increased with honeycomb diameter and surface in case of middle size honeycomb channels. For the smallest dimension of honeycomb, penetration of dissolution medium was insufficient whereas surface of tablets with widest honeycomb was smaller than middle size structure what resulted in decreasing of drug dissolution in both cases. This phenomena can allow the production of personalized medicines when applied with combination of different materials of various geometry.The quality of printed product as well as curing method depend on properties of spraying material.

        <p>Photosensitive polymers can be also used in this techniques and solidification of the layers is achieved by UV light. To assess the possibility of photopolymer resin application in 3D printing of drugs, tablets with ropinirole HCl, poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) and Irgacure 2959 as photoinitiator were prepared in an environment with low content of oxygen which can inhibit the curing transformations. Average printing time of tablets of 14 mg mass having 5.02 mm in diameter and 0.72 mm in height was ca. 4 min. Crosslinking of UV-sensitive material resulted in formation of amorphous solid dispersion of ropinirole HCl exhibiting sustained release of API from tablet up to 6 h (10). In this technique post-process removal of unbounded polymer and photoinitiator is important step. Toxicity of the components should be considered when this process is applied in drug formulation.Photosensitive polymers can be also used in this techniques and solidification of the layers is achieved by UV light.

        <p>This first attempts of DOD method application in drug formulation field revealed that tested matrix materials are suitable in prolonged release dosage forms fabrication. Challenging process of adaptation of a wide range of polymers needs to be evaluated. The modification in wax matrix composition or application of hydrophilic polymers may have a great impact on dissolution behavior. In case of solidification method based on UV light, possibility of APIs decomposition and stability matters should be taken into account.

        <p>Photosensitive liquid polymers are also used in stereolithography. The object is built by solidification of subsequent layers of resin in the presence of high energy light e.g. UV laser beam or light from projector (digital light projector -DLP). Laser beam guided by scanner mirrors precisely Bdraws^layers of the object on build platform by cross-linking of the photopolymer. In DLP techniques projector displays image of the whole layer. Printed object is bound to the build platform which is immersed in the photopolymer and layer is tracing on the surface of the resin. Subsequently, platform descends a distance equal to the thickness of a single layer and sweeper recoats object surface (Fig. 9).Photosensitive liquid polymers are also used in stereolithography. The object is built by solidification of subsequent layers of resin in the presence of high energy light e.g. UV laser beam or light from projector (digital light projector -DLP).

        <p>The fused deposition modelling is based on extrusion of molten thermoplastic material. Dimensions of filaments in the range of 1.75 mm and 2.85-3 mm are adopted to standard commercially available print heads. Standard filaments are made of thermoplastic polymers such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), poly(lactic acid) (PLA), high impact polystyrene (HIPS), polyethylene terephthalate glycol-modified (PET-G), nylon. There are some commercially available high-quality filaments processed from medically grade polymers such as PLA, PVA, nevertheless the filaments prepared from pharmaceutical grade polymers and containing APIs are not commercially available so far. To prepare drug-loaded filaments the thermal stability of impregnated API must be considered. In FDM process the filament guided by gears is moved towards heat end where it is melted and pushed forward through the nozzle orifice by unmelted filament. The diameter of the nozzle orifice varies from 0.2 to 0.4 mm, and has an impact on resolution of printed object. Usually the printed path width is equal to the orifice diameter and the height of the path is a half of its width, however the final settlements can vary depending on the printed material and printer settings. The paths are organized in layers and formed into the object which resolution depends on layer height. The mechanical parameters of the printed object are related to number of outlines which build the external wall of the object and infill parameters ratio and type (e.g. honeycomb or rectilinear).The fused deposition modelling is based on extrusion of molten thermoplastic material.

        <p>The filament quality attributes like constant dimension, elasticity, stiffness, homogenous drug distribution are of the key importance in the development of printed dosage form by using FDM method. Nowadays, HME is a main way to obtain good-quality filaments containing APIs, however the first attempts of FDM method application were based on ready-to-use, commercially available filaments for 3D printers. Model drugs were incorporated into the filaments by swelling filament in volatile solvent solution of API and drying. This approach allowed to prepare first 3D-printed dosage form by FDM method. Nevertheless, the drug content in the filaments prepared in this way ranged from 0.063 to 0.3% for ethanolic solutions (46) and 1.9% for methanolic soaking solutions (47) what was a limitation in higher dosage form fabrication. The simplest solution of this problem was a reextrusion of shredded or milled commercially available filament with APIs by HME. This process is designed to result in filaments with higher drug content and mechanical properties suitable for 3DP (46,48). Li Q. et al. (14) used this method for preparation of PVA-based filament containing 5% of glipizide. The development of dosage form formulation requires high quality pharmaceutical grade excipients which can be used in extrusion process. The excipients that meet the extrusion requirements should be characterized by proper glass transition temperature (T g ), i.e. lower than drug decomposition temperature, matrix forming capability and good rheological properties. Therefore, the printability of raw materials requires a deep understanding of the printing process, taking into account physical and chemical characteristic changes during its selection. As a result of HME process filaments with sufficient mechanical attributes should be obtained because during printing process filaments are bended and compressed between feeding gear and driving gear. Very brittle filaments can be broken by the gears whereas too soft filaments may be squeezed aside by the feeding gear. Zhang et al. tested different polymers: HPC, HPMC, EC, Soluplus ® , Eudragit ® L100 and combination of thereof as filament formers in HME process. The 3-point bend test was used to assess the mechanical properties of the prepared filaments and the results were compared with data obtained for PLA commercially available filaments. This approach allows to recognize border parameters and indicates which filament can be printable (49). The properties of starting materials for filament fabrication have a great impact on their printability, therefore the selection of appropriate HME-based matrices is required (50). Different matrix polymers, plasticizers and fillers were used to improve printability while lubricants were essentially used to reduce friction between filament and walls of the printing extruder (51). As a result of multicomponent formulation, high drug-load filaments with good mechanical properties can be obtained. Goyanes et al. (52) prepared filaments containing 50% of paracetamol based on HPMCAS with addition of methylparaben as plasticizer and magnesium stearate as lubricant. Drug loading in filaments depends on properties of APIs and excipients as well as the extruder construction and process parameters. High theophylline and metformine-loaded filaments were obtained by Verstraete et al. (). Different grades of hydrophilic and hydrophobic thermoplastic polyurethane were used as a matrix formers and filament with 60% of APIs was obtained. High content of crystalline drug resulted in rough surface of the filament which was reduced by milling of APIs prior to the extrusion process. After milling filament with consistent diameter, smooth surface morphology and good mechanical properties were obtained. The predefine printing parameters were found to influence printlets behavior. The infill ratio which varied from 25 to 100% had an impact on dissolution behavior of API. The decrease in drug dissolution with increased infill ratio was correlated with decreasing porosity. However, layer height from 200 to 400 μm as well as outline counts from 1 to 3 of printed tablets had no influence on drug dissolution profiles. The influence of infill ratio on dissolution profiles were reported in several publications (53). In case of paracetamol 5 and 50%-loaded tablets the influence of infill on dissolution profile was also observed. Additionally, the application of different grades of entering coating polymer (HPMCAS) as matrix forming polymer resulted in delayed dissolution profile characteristics. The drug amount released after 2 h in acidic medium did not exceed 10%. By combination of infill ratio and different grades of polymers the modified release dosage forms with different dissolution profiles were prepared (52).The filament quality attributes like constant dimension, elasticity, stiffness, homogenous drug distribution are of the key importance in the development of printed dosage form by using FDM method.

        <p>One of the advantage of FDM method is the possibility of API amorphization during printing or HME filament preparation.

        <p>Extrusion-based methods are very promising. They provide easy modification of the infill structure of the printlets, whereas other techniques (SLA, SLS) require new 3D models. However, during filament aging undesirable interactions between filament components and variation in moisture content can lead to changes in physical stability e.g. recrystallization of API. This can impact mechanical properties of filament and results in increased fragility or some shifts in melting temperature what can negatively affect the properties of printed dosage form.Extrusion-based methods are very promising.

        <p>The idea of more individualized pharmacotherapy has been developed for many years, however its meaning has never been greater as at present time. The need for developing personalized medicine by rational use of drugs by the patients in right dose is a subject of intensive discussion because heterogeneous nature of diseases is the source of difficulties in therapeutic intervention. The therapy failures or limitations of therapeutic effects are some of the reasons to modify the dosage form as well as dose of the active substance especially for individual age groups. The appropriate dosage forms need to be selected considering not only physicochemical properties but particularly target population and treated disease. The development of pharmaceutical product for pediatric and geriatric population is especially recommended due to the diverse needs and characteristic of each patient group. Due to the dose flexibility and difference in swallowing, tablets subdivision into two or even four parts is a common practice in health care. The problems with scored tablets has been reported in the literature. Unequally breaking and loss of mass after division finally could lead to over-or under dosing (58). Therefore, the implementation of three-dimensional printing may became extremely useful in the development of personalized therapy.The idea of more individualized pharmacotherapy has been developed for many years, however its meaning has never been greater as at present time.

        <p>The 3D printing allows to individualize medicine to the patient body weight and lifestyle by dose and dosage form adjustment, e.g. orodispersible tablets instead of conventional tablets for active or noncompliant patients. The simplicity of preparation of the medicines with different doses is caused by the scalability of the designed objects, thus the dose can be controlled by calculated material consumption during resizing of the printed object already at the design stage. This manufacturing method seems to be especially beneficial in the production of orphan drugs made for small groups of patients. Relatively low cost of production of dosage forms with different doses is one of the major advantage in term of short series of medicinal product (15,57).The 3D printing allows to individualize medicine to the patient body weight and lifestyle by dose and dosage form adjustment, e.g. orodispersible tablets instead of conventional tablets for active or noncompliant patients.

        <p>The 3D printing brings unprecedented opportunities for the development and preparation of personalized medicines at pharmaceutic or industrial scale. The introduction of 3D printers to the hospitals and community pharmacies would raise the pharmaceutical compounding to entirely new level. Especially in case of pediatric patients not only the dose of the active ingredient is important but also the quantity of the administered medicines, their shape, color and taste play a huge role in therapy (59). Moreover, in some 3D printing methods, like fused deposition modelling, where APIs are incorporated into polymer matrix, taste masking is achievable without any further processing such as film coating. Using this 3D printing method Scoutaris et al. () printed taste-masked dosage forms in the shape of Starmix ® Haribo jelly beans with indomethacin with good reproducibility, accuracy, content uniformity, and fast dissolution of the API. The size and the shape of the tablet affect patient acceptability, especially in term of swallowing difficulties. Tablet shape is also of crucial importance to the elderly patients not only due to the swallowing problems but also in accordance with the manipulating problems. Goyanes et al. (60) investigated the influence of different tablet shapes i.e. sphere, torus, disc, capsule and tilted diamond shape on the patients feelings in term of the ease of swallowing and handling. It was found that the easiest to swallow were doughnut shape i.e. torus tablets. The tablets of conventional shape were also defined as acceptable because of their similarity to standard dosage forms. In the previous studies the same team stated that this shape differences slightly influence the dissolution behavior so there should be a freedom of choosing the geometry for individual patients (). The effect of geometry and internal structure on the printed dosage forms properties is a separate issue and it was discussed in the FDM section of this article.The 3D printing brings unprecedented opportunities for the development and preparation of personalized medicines at pharmaceutic or industrial scale.

Using this 3D printing method Scoutaris et al. () printed taste-masked dosage forms in the shape of Starmix ® Haribo jelly beans with indomethacin with good reproducibility, accuracy, content uniformity, and fast dissolution of the API. The size and the shape of the tablet affect patient acceptability, especially in term of swallowing difficulties. Tablet shape is also of crucial importance to the elderly patients not only due to the swallowing problems but also in accordance with the manipulating problems. Goyanes et al. (60) investigated the influence of different tablet shapes i.e. sphere, torus, disc, capsule and tilted diamond shape on the patients feelings in term of the ease of swallowing and handling. It was found that the easiest to swallow were doughnut shape i.e. torus tablets. The tablets of conventional shape were also defined as acceptable because of their similarity to standard dosage forms. In the previous studies the same team stated that this shape differences slightly influence the dissolution behavior so there should be a freedom of choosing the geometry for individual patients (). The effect of geometry and internal structure on the printed dosage forms properties is a separate issue and it was discussed in the FDM section of this article.</p>
        <p>The 3D printing gives the opportunity for producing tablets with more than one active substance characterized by different properties and with different dissolution profiles. Thus, it can result in the reduction of the amount of used products by formulating complex medicines (61). By using of 3D printing technology the precise control over dissolution behavior can be achieved mainly by applying selected soluble or non-soluble excipients but also by designing the specified geometry and internal structure of the printed dosage forms (62). Nevertheless, this opportunity should only be used by healthcare professionals because it requires the knowledge about pharmacokinetics of the active substance and health condition of the patient and it could be applied in hospital pharmacies.The 3D printing gives the opportunity for producing tablets with more than one active substance characterized by different properties and with different dissolution profiles.

        <p>Although the solid oral dosage forms have been the most widely studied, the 3D printing was also utilized to fabricate transdermal drug delivery system. Luzuriaga et al. (63) printed microneedles with fluorescein. Additional etching step was necessary to achieve satisfactory microneedles shape. In the latest research on microneedles stereolithography was applied to obtain needles with appropriate shape and size and inkjet print was carried out to coat the microneedles with insulin formulation. The authors obtained rapid in vitro dissolution of insulin but the most important was the possibility to produce microneedle patches in a simple way (9). The use of microneedles can assure painless transdermal delivery of drugs and vaccines, however the manufacturing technologies are still difficult to apply in pharmaceutical industry (64). Nevertheless, 3D printing is promising method of fabrication of different microstructures.Although the solid oral dosage forms have been the most widely studied, the 3D printing was also utilized to fabricate transdermal drug delivery system.

        <p>The additive manufacturing methods were used to produce other topical delivery systems. Vaginal rings for controlled topical delivery of progesterone were successfully manufactured by J.

        <p>The 3D printing of the medicines in patient facilities is intensively discussed in the scientific communities but additive manufacturing techniques are still rather new for the society and vision that patients will print their medicines in their own houses is rather faraway perspective. The main obstacle to the implementation of this method to the patients is drug quality and safety issue. Patients or their medical care have to be thoroughly trained how to use printer and how to recognize quality defects that may appear in their self-printed drug. However, this approach can be beneficial for the patients as a higher involvement in the treatment process which was found to be clinically beneficial (65). On the other hand, it can also lead to some disadvantages like loss of control over adverse effects when formulating polypills with many active substances within one medication.The 3D printing of the medicines in patient facilities is intensively discussed in the scientific communities but additive manufacturing techniques are still rather new for the society and vision that patients will print their medicines in their own houses is rather faraway perspective.

        <p>As it was mentioned before 3D printing can be relatively easy introduced into the pharmaceutical compounding in the pharmacies. Fused deposition modelling seems to have the nearest way because having good quality of API loaded filament and database with objects to print, medically-educated staff i.e. pharmacist can print the final dosage form with defined architecture and dose of the active substance (65). The manufacturing of API-loaded filaments is not a big challenge for pharmaceutical industry because hot melt extrusion, which is the basic method of filament preparation, is well established in the pharmaceutical manufacturing. Printable filaments have been obtained so far from number of pharmaceutical grade polymers, i.e. cellulose derivatives, methacrylic acid copolymers, poly(ethylene oxide), poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(vinyl alcohol)-poly(ethylene glycol) graft copolymer, poly(vinyl caprolactam)-poly(vinyl acetate)-poly(ethylene glycol) graft copolymer, poly(ethylene glycols), ethylene vinyl acetate and others (12,50,38). One of the advantages of this 3D printing method is the possibility to produce filaments with incorporated API in crystalline state, which can be disordered during extemporaneous 3D printing. This approach can overcome the stability issue of amorphous drugs which are frequently formed during 3D printing because of the mechanism of the 3D printing process which is often based on melting of API with polymer or fast evaporation of the solvent from drug solution (66).As it was mentioned before 3D printing can be relatively easy introduced into the pharmaceutical compounding in the pharmacies.

        <p>The introduction of 3D printing into the pharmaceutical industry as a standard manufacturing method is still far away from present mainly because of the lack of ready-made production equipment. However, trends have been set by the first registered and marketed 3D-printed drug production method developed by Aprecia ® Pharmaceuticals. In this industrial scale pharmaceutical printing technology the formation of tablets is carried out by repeated cycles of building layers by the one feeding, liquid applying system on a conveyor (67). However, this is not the only possibility, other potential method could be the use of a number of print heads, and in case of powder bed bonding powder feeding zones, strictly corresponding to the number of layers of the tablet on a moving platform. In conventional 3D printers single nozzle is used to print whole object. Taking into account that one tablet is printed often for more than 1 min the effectiveness of such method is very limited. In this methods object has to be removed after printing and afterwards the printing process can be repeated. The printing on a conveyor is faster and eliminates the need for moving the nozzle in the Z axis because successive print heads can be fixed higher by layer height. One thing is certain, without developing equipment designed especially for pharmaceutical applications 3D printing will be still in the research phase and will not get to the pharmacotherapy. Tranfield et al. (68) gives directions what should characterize the ideal pharmaceutical 3D printer and emphasizes that only the collaborative work of 3D printer manufacturers, scientists, excipient suppliers and pharmaceutical regulators can result in developing the ideal 3D printer.The introduction of 3D printing into the pharmaceutical industry as a standard manufacturing method is still far away from present mainly because of the lack of ready-made production equipment.

        <p>Three-dimensional printing is rapidly growing technology that is characterized by the high potential from the pharmaceutical point of view Although it is still at the initial stage of considerations, many attempts have been made to scale up this technology and 3DP has become a successful method especially in personalized medicine. However, comprehensive research is still necessary to make the 3DP techniques industrially feasible for dosage form formulation. Nowadays, only one FDA-approved product is on the market. The printable products must comply with the current manufacturing and control standards for the medical products and devices. Current research shows both benefits of 3D printing technology and its limitations. Therefore, due to the large number of the factors affecting the quality of computationally designed dosage forms and safety of their use, the appropriate regulatory requirements are very desirable. Nowadays, there are no valid regulations concerning design, manufacturing process and quality testing considerations. There is a strong need to make some regulations for this particular group of manufacturing methods. Food and Drug Administration guidance released in December 2017, entitled Technical Considerations for Additive Manufactured Medical Devices gives the number of guidelines considering the main aspects from software and hardware requirements, quality control up to process validation procedures (69). As it is highlighted in the FDA document due to variability of additive manufacturing methods there is no possibility to give one universal set of guidelines for all of the 3D printing methods. For example, processes such as SLS and FDM cannot be compared because of different starting materials, i.e. powder for SLS and filament for FDM, different process parameters, i.e. laser beam energy, powder bed temperature etc. for SLS and extrusion and printing platform temperature for FDM technology. There are also some differences in post-processing in the printing methods: some of them, i.e. selective laser sintering, stereolithography or drop on solid methods require removing of manufacturing material residues while the other methods like fused deposition modelling or drop on drop method do not. It seems that every single printing method needs separate regulatory. It has to be underlined that there are still no regulations on medicinal products which are often more demanding than the requirements for medical devices. All of mentioned issues for devices should be considered in case of medicines as well. Moreover, the presence of API makes much more aspects have to be taken into account such as possible incompatibilities, active substance stability during printing process etc. This is of crucial importance because fused deposition modeling method utilizes high temperature twice, i.e. at the filament extrusion stage and even higher temperature during printing. The possibility of active substance amorphization and its stability as well as the influence on the product properties have to be tested and those should be specified in relevant guidelines.Three-dimensional printing is rapidly growing technology that is characterized by the high potential from the pharmaceutical point of view Although it is still at the initial stage of considerations, many attempts have been made to scale up this technology and 3DP has become a successful method especially in personalized medicine.

        <p>Additive manufacturing is of particular attention in craniofacial reconstructive surgery as individual face features can be precisely replicated what strongly affects physical appearance and aesthetic issue. Congenital or traumatic deformities of ears are commonly replaced by silicone prosthesis or patients cartilage, however it is expensive and usually involves several visits in hospital. Moreover, it is difficult to obtain the shape that perfectly fit to the defect site without additional fillers or resection of healthy tissues. The 3D-printed ears were reported in 2014 (74). The main part was printed from polycaprolactone supported by PEG artificial layer and chondrocytes and adipocytes encapsulated in hydrogel. It was proven that the composite structure satisfied expectations for both the anatomy and geometry of the native ear. Fabrication of low cost soft tissue prostheses was described by He, Xue and Fu who applied Scanning Printing Polishing Casting (SPPC) to manufacture artificial ear (75). The tissue casting mold was prepared on the basis of 3D scan, chemically polished and casted with medical grade silicon. The fabrication of smooth prosthesis was estimated to cost ca. $30. Nasal prosthesis was obtained by Unkovskiy et al. who printed two silicon-based prostheses and applied post-process sealing and coloring (76). Both of obtained prostheses fitted well into the patient's defect and set passively in position and both showed an acceptable adaptation to the adjacent skin.Additive manufacturing is of particular attention in craniofacial reconstructive surgery as individual face features can be precisely replicated what strongly affects physical appearance and aesthetic issue.

        <p>Aortic diseases treatment is easier due to the 3D-printed models that precisely reproduce aortic diameters and anatomy (87). Additive manufacturing of phantoms has been successfully introduced in patients with cardiac tumors or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy where the lesion size is the key parameter determining the selection of the surgical strategy, i.e. partial or total resection and heart transplant. This methodology has been implemented in the total resection of right ventricular. Implementation of 3D models is believed to provide rapid understanding of anatomical heart defects, including complex phenomena such as criss-cross atrioventricular connections (88).Aortic diseases treatment is easier due to the 3D-printed models that precisely reproduce aortic diameters and anatomy (87).

        <p>To decrease the risk of rejection of 3D-printed construct autologous source of cell can be used. They may be either taken during biopsies or differentiation of autologous stem cells. The 3D-printed mesenchymal stem cell laden was described in the treatment of myocardial infarctions due to the ability of the cells to reduce the myocardial fate of postinfarction collagen deposition and scar tissue formation (93). However, therapeutic efficacy is limited by restricted transport of cell-secreting therapeutic cytokines at the implantation site. The developed cross-linked poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate-based microchanneled hydrogel patch was found to effectively remove gel-tissue interface being a physical barrier for biomolecular transports thus facilitating the transport of cytokines.To decrease the risk of rejection of 3D-printed construct autologous source of cell can be used.

        <p>Among numerous successful examples of printed bio-based objects, bioprinting still faces several problems. One of the most important issue is long-term viability of the cells. Another one is control of cell proliferation in order to provide sufficient amount of functional and supporting cells and tissue homeostasis. The choice of cell type is also important as they need to be able to reconstruct organ building blocks of various function, architecture and size. Moreover, the tissues used in 3D printing should be able to survive pressure and shear stress during printing, presence of harmful chemical compounds and nonphysiological pH. Beside aforementioned conditions, also scaffold material should meet given criteria such as biocompatibility, non-toxic by-products, appropriate mechanical and structural properties as this can affect cell migration, adhesion and proliferation (96).Among numerous successful examples of printed bio-based objects, bioprinting still faces several problems.
