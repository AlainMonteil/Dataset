        <p>The commercial fifth-generation (5G) wireless communications networks have already been deployed with the aim of providing high data rates. However, the rapid growth in the number of smart devices and the emergence of the Internet of Everything (IoE) applications, which require an ultra-reliable and low-latency communication, will result in a substantial burden on the 5G wireless networks. As such, the data rate that could be supplied by 5G networks will unlikely sustain the enormous ongoing data traffic explosion. This has motivated research into continuing to advance the existing wireless networks toward the future generation of cellular systems, known as sixth generation (6G). Therefore, it is essential to provide a prospective vision of the 6G and the key enabling technologies for realizing future networks. To this end, this paper presents a comprehensive review/survey of the future evolution of 6G networks. Specifically, the objective of the paper is to provide a comprehensive review/survey about the key enabling technologies for 6G networks, which include a discussion about the main operation principles of each technology, envisioned potential applications, current state-of-the-art research, and the related technical challenges. Overall, this paper provides useful information for industries and academic researchers and discusses the potentials for opening up new research directions.The commercial fifth-generation (5G) wireless communications networks have already been deployed with the aim of providing high data rates.

        <p>The global mobile data traffic has increased considerably during the last few years. Assessment of recent statistics collected by International Telecommunication Union (ITU) indicate that global mobile data traffic is expected to grow to 607 Exabytes (EBs) per month by 2025 and 5016 EB by 2030 [1]. The amount of data traffic per subscriber is expected to be around 39 EBs by 2025 and about 257 EBs by 2030. Furthermore, almost 70% of the population is expected to subscribe to mobile services by 2025. Besides this, 60% out of this 70% are estimated to use mobile Internet.The global mobile data traffic has increased considerably during the last few years.

        <p>The huge data traffic demands have been accompanied by increasing requirements for heterogeneous services, full coverage, ultra high-speed wireless communications with ultra high reliability and ultra low-latency. The main drivers of the dramatic growth in data traffic are personal computers (PCs), laptops, tablets, smartphones, sensors and Internet of Everything (IoE) devices/applications.

To date, there are five different generations of mobile communications systems, which belong to different standards and have different techniques and capabilities (see Table 1). The period of each mobile generation in Table 1 is predicted based on references [3], [4]. Notably, each generation of mobile communications networks has been developed roughly every ten years. The evolution from 1G to 6G mobile wireless communications networks is shown in Fig. 3. 1G was introduced in the 1980s to provide voice services. 1G networks provided a data rate of 2.4 kbps. However, 1G was developed based on analog transmission, and was faced challenges such as low capacity, inconsistent delivery and lack of security [5]. To address the issues of 1G, secondgeneration (2G) mobile communications networks based on digital modulation technologies were developed in the 1990s. 2G has been used to provide encrypted data services such as short message services (SMS) in addition to traditional voice communications [6]. The second-generation network was based on the global systems for mobile communications (GSM) and provided a data rate of 64 kbps. The 1G and 2G mobile communications systems are based on public switched telephone network (PSTN), which is considered as a combination of several telephone networks, including telephone lines, switching centers, fiber optic networks, cellular networks and satellites networks.The huge data traffic demands have been accompanied by increasing requirements for heterogeneous services, full coverage, ultra high-speed wireless communications with ultra high reliability and ultra low-latency.

        <p>Around the year 2000, the third generation (3G) of mobile communications networks was introduced to support the increasing demands for different multi-data services such as video calls and internet surfing. Therefore, various technologies such as wideband code-division multiple access (WCDMA), CDMA2000, unpaired spectrum based on time-division synchronous CDMA (TD-SCDMA) with time division duplex (TDD) and worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) have been used in 3G networks [7]. 3G networks provided a data rate up to 2 Mb/s [8], which is achieved using high-speed packet access (HSPA) technology. In 2009, the fourth generation (4G) of mobile communication, which represents the long-term evolution (LTE) network, was launched. LTE networks support both paired and unpaired spectra, i.e., operate in both the time division duplex (TDD) and frequency division duplex (FDD) modes. Different technologies such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), coordinated multiple transmission/reception (CoMP), and multiple-input and multipleoutput (MIMO) techniques have been used in LTE networks. These technologies have been developed to enable a wider transmission bandwidth, to achieve a high data rate, and to allow wider mobile broadband connections. LTE mobile communication system was extended to LTE-Advanced network in 2011, which allows the operation in unlicensed spectrum. 4G LTE network with a 2 × 2 MIMO provides a maximum data rate up to 150 Mb/s while LTE-Advanced networks are able to achieve a maximum data rate of up to 1 Gb/s using a 4 × 4 MIMO system over a 100 MHz aggregated bandwidth [9]. Currently, 5G network is becoming a commercial reality. 5G network can support wide area network (WAN) bands in addition to radios for wireless local area network (LAN) and personal area network (PAN). 5G network has the potential to aggregate spectral, support high-definition (HD) video streaming and several data-hungry applications. Also, 5G network has the ability to achieve faster throughput than the LTE-A system with a maximum data rate of about 20 Gb/s. Furthermore, an advanced multiple access technology termed as beam division multiple access (BDMA) can be exploited in 5G network to increase the system capacity. In this multiplexing technique, an orthogonal beam can be allocated to the users according to their locations [10].Around the year 2000, the third generation (3G) of mobile communications networks was introduced to support the increasing demands for different multi-data services such as video calls and internet surfing.

        <p>Recent advancements in smart devices and applications have promoted the proliferation of IoE networks. IoE networks involve autonomous and flying vehicles, healthcare applications, intelligent services, and other delay-sensitive applications. Such IoE networks would require ubiquitous sensing and computing capabilities that may exceed the capability of 5G networks. Furthermore, the data rate that can be supported by 5G networks is unlikely to sustain the enormous ongoing data traffic explosion. This has motivated research into continuing to advance the existing wireless systems in order to meet the emerging IoE applications and services. Therefore, the research now shifted to 6G wireless communications networks. Unlike previous networks, future 6G wireless communications systems are expected to support IoE applications and services. 6G supports the integration between different networks, e.g., terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks. For example, 6G supports satellite communication to increase connectivity and provide full coverage. To enable efficient integration between different networks, 6G will make use of network slicing and multi-access edge computing with software defined networks. In comparison with previous networks, 6G is expected to fully utilize artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). 6G networks are expected to utilize ultra-high frequencies such as the use of millimeter wave (mmWave) and THz frequencies. The autonomous vehicle is expected to be fully supported by 6G. An extreme densification of the network infrastructure is expected to be deployed by the 6G networks. While the main focus on 5G was given to the massive MIMO technology, the reconfigurable intelligent reflecting surfaces will be the main core transmission technique for 6G networks. Unlike previous networks, 6G aims to fully support the Tactile Internet communication, which needs less than 1 ms delay for being able to perform light surgeries. To sum up, the future vision of 6G wireless communications networks lies in: (a) achieving high data rate/spectral efficiency particularly by moving to higher frequency bands; (b) providing an energy efficiency of 10x higher than 5G networks for green communication; (c) increasing the connectivity and providing full coverage; (d) maintaining security, secrecy and privacy; (e) achieving an ultra-high-reliable and low-latency communication; (f) supporting an externally high mobility of up to 1000 km per hour; and finally (g) realizing intelligence.

        <p>Multiple antenna technology which benefits from beamforming, diversity, and spatial multiplexing gains, has attracted significant research interest due to its powerful capability to increase the data rate and communication reliability [43]. The research studies on multiple antenna technologies initially focused on point-to-point (single-user) MIMO communications where the transceiver has multiple antennas to communicate with each other. Later, the focus shifted to multiuser MIMO systems, which quickly made their way in many communications standards such as IEEE 802.11 (WiFi), IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX), LTE and, LTE-A [44]. Unlike point-to-point MIMO, in multiuser MIMO systems, the spatial multiplexing of different data streams intended for different users can be achieved in the spatial domain through a transmission technique known as spatial division multiple access (SDMA) [45]. Recently a scaled-up version of the SDMA systems, i.e., large-scale multiuser MIMO, was proposed in [46], wherein each transmit base station (BS) is equipped with a relatively large number of transmit antenna elements N , which serve a much smaller number of K single-antenna non-cooperative users. Table 3 summarizes the key differences between the point-to-point MIMO and massive MIMO communications systems.Multiple antenna technology which benefits from beamforming, diversity, and spatial multiplexing gains, has attracted significant research interest due to its powerful capability to increase the data rate and communication reliability [43].

Unlike point-to-point MIMO, in multiuser MIMO systems, the spatial multiplexing of different data streams intended for different users can be achieved in the spatial domain through a transmission technique known as spatial division multiple access (SDMA) [45]. Recently a scaled-up version of the SDMA systems, i.e., large-scale multiuser MIMO, was proposed in [46], wherein each transmit base station (BS) is equipped with a relatively large number of transmit antenna elements N , which serve a much smaller number of K single-antenna non-cooperative users. Table 3 summarizes the key differences between the point-to-point MIMO and massive MIMO communications systems.</p>

        <p>• Related challenges and future research directions From the point of view of information theory, which is considered as the abstract mathematical theory that guides the design and implementation of communication systems, the performance of multiple antennas systems depends strongly on the accuracy of channel state information (CSI) estimation. While CSI estimation may not be problematic in TDD mode, which relies on UL/DL channel reciprocity, it is of critical importance to most of current mobile networks providers that operate in the FDD mode. In addition to this, 6G networks are expected to operate in high mobility environments and high carrier frequencies, and thus, the channel would exhibit a shorter coherence time. Therefore, finding a feasible design that copes with the high-speeds and high frequencies environments is crucial. Furthermore, an opportunistic and low-complexity scheduling procedure with multiple antennas systems is required to alleviate the need for computationally expensive exhaustive users search whose complexity grows exponentially with the user group size [43]. Furthermore, research investigation to address the technical challenges related to the optimum beam selection and reducing the CSI feedback overhead is also required. To achieve this purpose, different CSI feedback compression schemes can be exploited to reduce the CSI overhead, examples of which are discussed in references [80]- [85]. Another challenge related to the use of large antenna arrays is the nonwide sense stationary properties that may appear along with the array. This implies that different parts of the arrays may have different propagation environments, or they exhibit the same channel paths with different power levels [86]. As such, new channel models that capture these propagation effects are required. In addition to this, using large antenna ar- rays might practically increase the computational complexity, cost of hardware design and power consumption [87], [88].• Related challenges and future research directions From the point of view of information theory, which is considered as the abstract mathematical theory that guides the design and implementation of communication systems, the performance of multiple antennas systems depends strongly on the accuracy of channel state information (CSI) estimation.

Besides, mmWave can be efficiently used to support automated vehicular communication, which would allow the vehicles with high speed to exchange information seamlessly [131], [132]. MmWave communication also has the potential to support self wireless backhaul in cellular networks [133]. Experimental results in [134] demonstrate that mmWave has the potential to support both outdoor and indoor communications. The results show that a data rate of about 500 Mb/s can be achieved in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environments and with a mobility of 8 km/h. MmWave can be used with the existing microwave frequencies in cellular communications. In this context, the work in [135] proposes a way of using microwave frequencies to send control information and mmWave frequencies to convey payload data transmission. mmWave communication has the potential to support high-speed data rate for different wireless devices such as smartphones, smartwatches and augmented &amp; virtual realities [136], [137]. However, communication at mmWave frequencies suffers from specific propagation behaviors such as high signal attenuation and absorption as well as high penetration loss. MmWave signals are subject to ordersof-magnitude increase in path loss in comparison to the microwave signals, which are currently used in most cellular systems [138]. However, the short-wavelength range in mmWave communications allows the deployment of smallsized arrays with a large number of antenna elements that can be contained in a small physical dimension. Therefore, using a large number of antenna arrays can achieve a sufficient beamforming gain that is required to overcome the path loss and allow spatial multiplexing of several data streams to further improve the spectral efficiency [138]. Besides that, large beamforming gain provided by mmWave communications has the potential to improve the link quality, extend coverage and reduce interference [139]. The work in [134] demonstrates that using large antenna arrays with mmWave is useful to overcome the high path loss in cellular systems. However, there are fundamental differences between using large antenna arrays in the conventional microwave frequency and mmWave frequency in terms of the propagation channels, hardware design and signal processing algorithms [140]. For example, the existing hardware architecture supports full digital base band beamforming at microwave frequency, which directly controls the phase and amplitude of signals and allows flexible transmission [140]. However, the joint use of analog and digital beamforming is preferable at mmWave frequency to overcome the radio-frequency hardware limitations [138], [141]. It is worth noting that analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) in mmWave systems could be expensive and energy inefficient in comparison to microwave systems [129]. Typically, large base station antenna elements can be easily implemented using fully digital arrays, but the implementation complexity may grow larger with mmWave frequency [140]. Besides, a separate radio-frequency chain for each antenna may be required with mmWave system [129]. In addition, jointly using both analog and digital beamforming in mmWave communication would reduce the multiplexing capability of serving multiple users simultaneously over the same time and frequency, and hence, reduce the spectral efficiency in comparison to full digital beamforming [140]. Therefore, whether mmWave with large antenna arrays will be implemented with full digital or hybrid beamforming remains an open research question [140]. NOMA technique can be combined with mmWave frequencies to improve the data rates, achieve simultaneous multiuser communications and reduce interference [121], [142]- [146]. Furthermore, UAVs communication can benefit sig-nificantly from mmWave frequency to provide high data rates for 6G networks [147], [148].

Furthermore, applying artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms in LiDAR is possible for enhancing the system performance. This could be a possible research direction that is worth investigating in the future. Optical camera communication (OCC), which uses image sensors or cameras for communication, positioning, and navigation, is introduced as a promising technology for wireless communication in the future networks [159], [242]. OCC is considered as a part of OWC that explores the available spectrum regions related to the infrared and ultraviolet frequency bands to provide wireless data communication [243], [244]. Hence, much wider spectrum regions can be occupied by OCC in comparison with the spectrum regions of VLC, hence alleviating some of the currently congested communication traffic [242]. However, since the bit decoding method used for the camera is different from the photodiode method used in VLC, some adjustments are still required with OCC transmission systems. This is attributed to the fact that the output of cameras in OCC are images and not voltages as in most of the VLC systems [242]. OCC has been included in IEEE 802.15.7r1 standard [201], [243]. OCC uses commercial LED lighting sources at the transmitter and image sensors or cameras to decode LED modulated data at the receiver.

IBFD could allow efficient usage of radio resources, reducing the delay between UL and DL [249], and increasing the spectral efficiency in comparison to the conventional duplex operation modes [250]. In IBFD, the transmission and reception are carried out simultaneously at the same time over the same frequency band [251]. Thus, the number of information bits that are reliably transmitted per second per Hz can be doubly increased [252]. IBFD radio transmission can also be beneficial for the access layer, where a node is capable to reliably transmit the outgoing frame while simultaneously receiving the ongoing one [253].While the current wireless communications systems make use of either TDD or FDD duplex operation modes, in-band full-duplex (IBFD) is introduced as a promising operation mode to improve the data rate for future 6G wireless networks.

        <p>• Key points of full-duplex radio communication IBFD technique can support a diverse set of IoT applications. These applications include cognitive radio, smallscale heterogeneous networks, bidirectional communication, cooperative transmission, and relaying networks [97]. Among these applications, IBFD relaying is considered to be the most promising one to achieve the full potential gain of IBFD, which is predicted to double the spectral efficiency [254]. This is attributed to the traffic symmetric pattern of relaying systems, wherein a relatively same amount of data can be transmitted and received over the same frequency band in the full-duplex mode [255]. Therefore, the frequency reuse with relaying systems can be efficiently maximized. In addition, the transmission power of relay systems is relatively small, which makes it more feasible for a full-duplex communication system to mitigate the self-interference [256]. Note that relay networks play an essential role in extending the radio coverage, especially in a strongly shadowed urban environment [257], [258]. Besides, the self-interference can be stronger than the desired signal, thus making it impossible for the receiver to decode the signal of interest. This can severely deteriorate the performance of IBFD systems. Typically, self-interference cannot be perfectly mitigated in practice. As such, effective self-interference mitigation tech-niques are the key to create a pathway for realizing IBFD in practice. Specifically, advanced signal processing techniques could play an essential role in reducing self-interference. Self-interference cancellation is to date considered as an open research problem in IBFD systems, albeit several cancellation techniques have been proposed (see e.g. [253] and the references therein).

Among the above techniques, OFDM has been the dominant modulation technique for multicarrier communications and received significant research attention. This is due to its capability to provide immunity against frequency selective fading, co-channel interference, and impulse noise [264]. OFDM modulation transmission has several advantages such as (a) allowing the use of adaptive modulation schemes to increase the data rate; (b) enhancing spectrum efficiency, i.e., efficient utilization of the available bandwidth, i.e., dividing the available spectrum between users efficiently; (c) providing immunity against intersymbol interference (ISI); and (d) supporting multipath delay spread [266].

        <p>Several alternative multicarrier transmission techniques, which address some of the shortcomings of OFDM, have been proposed as new candidates for the next generation of mobile communications. For example, filter bank multicarrier (FBMC) with an offset quadrature amplitude modulation (OQAM) has been proposed in [268] to provide a higher data rate and reduce the unwanted OOB radiation that faces the OFDM technique. In FBMC transmission, the nonadjacent subcarriers are well separated through the use of a bank of well-designed filters. The FBMC can be well designed to reduce the narrow-band interference and unwanted sidelobes. However, the length of the filter impulse response in FBMC needs to be increased by at least four times the transmit symbols. This design constrain may make the FBMC technique infeasible to be applied to the delay sensitize applications, wherein high spectral efficiency requires to be achieved with short burst transmissions. Therefore, the focus has shifted to the universal filtered multicarrier (UFMC) [269], wherein a group of several subcarriers is filtered together instead of per subcarrier filtering with a larger length using in FBMC. Therefore, by applying the filtering operation to a group of consecutive subcarriers in the UFMC technique, the length of the filter impulse response could be reduced while reducing the unwanted out-of-band radiation. However, the UFMC technique comprises the need for cyclic prefix (CP) insertion, which is typically required in most of the multicarrier waveforms, thus making the UFMC technique more vulnerable to time misalignment in comparison to most CPbased techniques. Also, UFMC is subject to ISI with moderately large delay spreads. Filtered-OFDM (f-OFDM) has been also introduced as a new waveform for future wireless systems [270] to overcome the limitation of the UFMC tech-nique. In contrast to the UFMC, the filtered-OFDM technique allows the filter length to be varied and even exceed the CP length in conventional CP-based techniques to obtain better balancing between the time and frequency localization. However, increasing the CP length is not necessarily a feasible solution for low-latency applications in the future communications networks. A more flexible modulation technique, termed generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) has been proposed in [271], [272] as a candidate waveform for future wireless communications. GFDM technique takes the advantages of both OFDM and single carrier frequency. In GFDM technique, the subcarriers are filtered and combined into blocks and each block is modulated independently. However, such filtering and combining approach could result in non-orthogonal subcarriers, which might lead to increase the inter-carrier interference and ISI. Therefore, efficient receiving techniques are required with GFDM based techniques in order to mitigate the ISI and ICI. Although using such interference cancellation techniques could be useful to obtain a reasonable performance, this comes at the expense of increasing the computational complexity. It is worth noting that FBMC and GFDM are considered as pulse shaping modulation techniques while UFMC and f-OFDM are considered to be subband filtering schemes [273]. Recently, a two-dimensional modulation scheme, which is a generalization of both CDMA and OFDM, termed as orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) has been proposed in [274] to support high-speeds, high frequencies, and large antenna arrays transmissions. OTFS modulation has the ability to covert the time-varying multipath wireless channel into a time-independent channel, which allows each transmitted symbol to be experienced a near-constant channel gain. The results show that OTFS modulation can provide higher diversity gains over time and frequency in comparison to the conventional OFDM modulation scheme. Such constant channel gain overall symbols would allow the system overhead and complexity to be reduced. Analog types of modulations may also be possible for future 6G networks. It is worth noting that the typical key performance indicators that have been used in the performance evaluation of the aforementioned transmission techniques are PARP, design complexity, filter length, power-spectral density (PSD), bit-error-rate (BER), spectral efficiency (SE), and latency.Several alternative multicarrier transmission techniques, which address some of the shortcomings of OFDM, have been proposed as new candidates for the next generation of mobile communications.

        <p>With OMA techniques, the available resource blocks within each cell are divided orthogonally and allocated either in the time, frequency, or code domains, thus reducing the interference among adjacent blocks and allowing simple signal detection. However, OMA techniques serve a single user in each orthogonal radio resource block. Therefore, the number of served users is limited by the number of available radio resource blocks, and thus, the available spectrum might not be efficiently exploited.

        <p>It is worth noting that SDMA, mentioned in subsection II-A, can be considered as a non-orthogonal spatial multiplexing technique because it spatially multiplexes the transmitted data in the spatial domain, i.e., power domain. SDMA uses linear precoding to spatially separate users in the power domain [288]. Massive MIMO system is considered as an extended version of SDMA, as discussed in subsection II-A. Massive MIMO system can be utilized to mitigate the interference. However, the interference management using massive MIMO technology might be insufficient due to the extremely limited spatial resolution of the large antenna arrays, which could occur when the transmit array is far away from the users [97].

With largescale antenna arrays, each antenna element requires a complete radio-frequency chain to produce digital modulation. This implies that a large number of full-active antennas could have large form factors that require high-cost components to guarantee efficient transmission. In addition, it is likely that much of the power consumption will come from RF power amplifiers and the associated baseband signal processing [303], [304], and thus, this might reduce the energy efficiency of 6G networks.

Spatial modulation design paradigm aims to erode the cost and complexity of the large-scale antenna transmissions while maintaining a feasible data rate and endto-end system performance. The basic principle of spatial modulation is to map a block of information bits at the transmitter into two units: 1) an information symbol, which is selected from a constellation diagram, and 2) information over the channel, which is chosen from a set of indices related to unique transmit antennas [197], [305], [306].

        <p>The continuous growth in wireless data traffic, which comes from connecting billions of devices to the Internet, has led to an increase in energy consumption. In addition, network operators have recognized that the traditional approaches of deploying more small cells might not be sufficient to meet the ongoing huge data traffic demands. Besides, one of the significant challenges that face the small cell networks deployment is the considerable amount of intercell interference (ICI) from other cells [308]. Thus, finding feasible energy- efficient designs and operations for future 6G networks with an aim to reduce the undesirable carbon dioxide (CO2) emission per mobile subscriber becomes essential [309]. In addition, finding suitable designs for realizing economically sustainable future wireless communications systems that achieve both spectral and energy efficiencies with low hardware cost are crucial [88], [310]. Therefore, green radio access network concept has been introduced to optimize the spectrum resources and minimize energy consumption. The radio resources in the wireless communications systems can be efficiently allocated to maximize energy efficiency [311]. The metric for calculating the energy efficiency of a communication link is obtained by dividing the number of information bits (over the total consumed energy) by the entire network measured in [bit/Joule] [312]. Energy management is essential for the sustainability of future 6G wireless communications networks [313]. Recently, cloud radio access network (C-RAN) concept [314] is introduced as a promising network infrastructure to overcome the increasing mobile traffic demands in cellular systems [315], [316]. In C-RAN, most of the intensive computational tasks, such as precoding matrix calculation, baseband signal processing, and channel estimation are moved to the cloud [316]. In this regard, C-RAN has the potential to reduce energy consumption in order to achieve green wireless communications systems [317]. However, finding feasible front-haul solutions to centralization the C-RAN network is essential [317]. In addition, the C-RAN network requires a virtualization implementation to realize resource cloudification [317]. Furthermore, energy consumption can be reduced using an efficient network planning scheme [318]. Also, suitable switch-on/switch-off algorithms may be required to control the traffic conditions and reduce the energy consumption [319], [320]. Besides, finding feasible hardware designs that account for energy consumption is essential for energy-efficient wireless communications systems [321]. This includes the design of an efficient radiofrequency chain and the use of simplified transmitter/receiver structures, e.g., one-bit signal quantization and the utilization of hybrid analog/digital beamforming [318]. Mobile cloud computing such as fog and edge computing is another impressive technique for achieving energy efficiency in wireless communications systems [316], [322], [323]. Mobile cloud computing allows users with huge computing demands to offload their intensive tasks to the edge cloud in order to save energy. Further discussion about edge computing is provided in subsection VI-E.

Recently, several studies have investigated the energy efficiency maximizing with large number antennas arrays, see e.g., [67], [326]- [329]. These investigations have focused on exploiting an optimum power allocation, scheduling algorithms, and network topology to reduce energy consumption.

        <p>Energy harvesting is considered one of the most promising techniques to increase energy efficiency in 6G networks. Energy harvesting enables wireless devices to harvest energy from radio-frequency signals using rectenna circuits, which can be used to charge the devices' batteries wirelessly to support their operations [330]. For example, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are widely used for healthcare monitoring. As such, the total power consumption in such networks, which require long-term connectivity and long battery life, is considered a major issue. Therefore, energy harvesting can be efficiently exploited to support WSNs [331].Energy harvesting is considered one of the most promising techniques to increase energy efficiency in 6G networks.

        <p>• Key points of energy harvesting The energy harvesting technique has the potential to reduce the carbon footprint [332]. The energy harvesting technique allows an efficient battery-powered operation for wireless networks. This makes wireless networks to be deployed in remote rural areas and in the human body [332]. Energy harvesting can be used in many medical and safety applications and in remote monitoring with extended battery life and longer communications ranges [332]. Furthermore, the energy harvesting technique allows wireless communications networks to be powered by clean sources of energy [318]. Typically, energy harvesting technique includes wireless power transfer (WPT), wireless powered communication network (WPCN) and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) [330], [333], [334]. Therefore, a special design at the receiver side is required to retrieve the information and energy. In the WPT approach, the power transmitter transfers the energy to user devices without information. The transferred energy is then utilized to charge the devices' batteries. The WPT-based approach has the potential to be used with implant devices for medical purposes, electric cars and wireless grids [335]. In WPCN based approach, the energy is firstly harvested in the user devices and then used to transmit data. Hence, the communication efficiency of wireless devices can be significantly improved [336]. In SWIPT based approach, the power transmitter can simultaneously transfer energy and information to the user devices. Then, the users would either harvest energy or decode the information sent by the power transmitter. As such, an efficient energyinformation transmission can be achieved [337]. SWIPT technique has the potential to achieve the best use of the radio-frequency spectrum/radiation [338]. SWIPT technique allows a massive number of IoT devices to be powered and connected anywhere and anytime [338]. Several studies have investigated the energy harvesting technique for green communications. For example, the trade-off between the energy harvesting and the information rate in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels has been investigated in [339]. This study assumed a realistic receiver, which harvests the energy and decodes the information from the same signal. A more practical scenario with power-splitting (PS) and time-switching (TS) based approaches has been considered in [340]. In PS based technique, the receiver can split the received signal into two diffident parts, one to decode the useful information and one to harvest the energy. In TS, however, the receiver can instantaneously switch between the decoding information and the energy harvesting. The antenna switching (AS) technique, which uses switches to switch between antenna elements to achieve decoding or rectifying, can also be used for SWIPT [340]. A new approach that exploits spatial switching (SS) of the information and energy was proposed in [341]. In SS based approach, the MIMO channel can be efficiently decomposed into parallel channels using singular value decomposition (SVD). In this case, the MIMO wireless channels can carry either information or energy, thereby neither TS nor PS is necessary. A new approach that exploits the generalized triangular decomposition (GTD) structure was proposed in [342]. The proposed GTD approach allows the MIMO channel to be decomposed and jointly used for energy harvesting and information exchange. The energy harvesting and information can be effectively separated at the receiver.• Key points of energy harvesting The energy harvesting technique has the potential to reduce the carbon footprint [332].

For example, the small sizes of UAVs and the variability of positions and speeds make the detection and tracking of UAVs challenging. Therefore, developing a robust mechanism for the identification and tracking of UAVs is essential. Large-scale MIMO systems can be jointly used with radars to increase the probability of UAVs detection [50]. In addition, UAVs are typically consumed high energy to support their movement flexibility and maintain long-distance travel [357]. Therefore, an advanced power management mechanism is required.

        <p>• Key points of the Cell-free communication Cell-free massive MIMO communication system has the potential to achieve spatial diversity by allowing a mobile user to be jointly served on the same time-frequency resource by more than one base station in a coordinated manner. The main difference between cell-free communication and conventional MIMO systems is that instead of allocating each mobile user to a particular cell with a specific base station, which is equipped with a relatively large number of antenna elements, it relaxes the constraint of cell boundaries. Thus, the inter-cell interference caused by mobile users located at cell boundaries can effectively be mitigated or even eliminated. In addition, the disadvantage of poor channel quality that may happen when only one base station is serving can be effectively addressed. Furthermore, the main objective of a cell-free massive MIMO communication system is to achieve coherent processing over large geographically distributed base station antennas. This would allow an enhanced quality of service, nearly uniform achievable rates across the coverage area, and seamless handover across all mobile users regardless of their position in the networks. In cell-free massive MIMO systems, all mobile users have relatively equal distances to the allocated access points. Owing to its capability of exploring the spatial diversity against the fading, cell-free massive MIMO communication can potentially provide a much higher probability of coverage in comparison to the conventional collocated MIMO systems. Using a large number of arbitrarily distributed access points in a cell-free massive MIMO system would offer high multiplexing gain, more degrees of freedom, and high array gain. Cell-free massive MIMO works with any frequency bands, including sub-6 GHz, mmWave bands, and THz frequencies [401]. In addition, cell-free massive MIMO communication is particularly beneficial for cell-edge mobile users that experience severe large-scale fading. Cell-free networks are operated in TDD mode, which relies on UL/DL channel reciprocity to obtain the CSI for DL precoding. Cell-free massive MIMO can also be integrated with aerial systems to efficiently improve energy efficiency and enhance system coverage [402]. Cellfree massive MIMO system allows low-complexity digital signal processing schemes to be implemented in both UL and DL transmissions. Hence, most baseband signal processing can be accomplished locally at the access points and under computational assistance from the CPU [394]. This UPU can be considered as a cloud-edge processor where its design is reminiscent of the framework of C-RAN [118], [403], discussed in III. The results in [394], [395], [404] show that cell-free massive MIMO system outperforms conventional small-cell and cellular massive MIMO systems. The results in [394] demonstrate that cell-free massive MIMO can achieve up to five times improvement in terms of 95%likely per-user data rate in comparison to the conventional small-cell system, and, more importantly, is more robust to undesired fading and interference. Even an enhanced 95%likely per-user data rate performance can be achieved by cellfree massive MIMO when the access points and users are equipped with multiple antennas [405].

        <p>• Related challenges and future research directions Similar to the conventional MIMO systems, the perfor-mance of cell-free massive MIMO relies on the accuracy of the CSI estimation, which is obtained using training sequence transmission between the access points and users. However, since the channels are varied in time and frequency, the pilot resources need to be reused between users. Hence, this pilot reused may cause pilot contamination that reduces the cellfree massive MIMO performance. In addition, CSI estimation may be problematic in FDD operation mode where the channel reciprocity between UL and DL does not hold. The backhaul is another practical constraint that faces the cellfree massive MIMO system, which needs to be investigated. Besides, the system-level performance of cell-free massive MIMO should be thoroughly investigated. For example, developing low-complexity scheduling techniques that achieve fairness across the users are required, especially when a large number of users need to be served simultaneously over the same time and frequency resource block. Finding feasible resource allocation algorithms in cell-free massive MIMO networks is also needed. In addition, optimizing the access point locations and how to efficiently broadcast system information and signals synchronization is also essential. Finding a feasible user-centric approach is still challenging. As such, further investigation in this regard is required. The application of machine learning and deep learning in cell-free massive MIMO systems is also an interesting research topic that needs to be investigated in the future. Furthermore, developing a feasible mechanism for random access and power control algorithms, which balance delay, fairness, and data rate, in cell-free massive MIMO networks is required [396]. NOMAenabled two-step random access channel (RACH) [416] can be used with cell-free massive MIMO networks to enhance resource utilization efficiency and reduce delay [401]. This combination of NOMA and cell-free massive MIMO systems should be further investigated in the future.• Related challenges and future research directions Similar to the conventional MIMO systems, the perfor-mance of cell-free massive MIMO relies on the accuracy of the CSI estimation, which is obtained using training sequence transmission between the access points and users. However, since the channels are varied in time and frequency, the pilot resources need to be reused between users. Hence, this pilot reused may cause pilot contamination that reduces the cellfree massive MIMO performance. In addition, CSI estimation may be problematic in FDD operation mode where the channel reciprocity between UL and DL does not hold.

        <p>While 5G networks support machine-type communication (MTC) and URLLC scenarios, 6G is expected to support massive MTC (mMTC) and massive URLLC (mURLLC) applications. This allows 6G networks to deliver any required performance within the rate-reliability-latency space. The URLLC in 5G networks was specified to limited reliability and latency applications. However, 6G networks with mMTC and mURLLC departs form the limited reliability and latency requirements toward archiving the scalability requirements. Also, 6G aims to achieve the best trade-off between these requirements. These massive services classes of 6G networks will lead to ubiquitous mobile ultrabroadband (uMUB), ultrahigh-speed-with-low-latency communications (uHSLLC), and ultrahigh data density (uHDD) [236]. Emerging uMUB, uHSLLC, and uHDD services will require a new codesign of communication, control, sensing, and computing features that are mostly absent in the 5G networks. As such, 6G aims to fully support these future requirements. 6G networks are expected to evolve toward allowing massive ubiquitous connectivity, integration of different technologies and applications, enabling intelligence, and achieve massive decentralized computation operations [117]. 6G networks also aim to enable machine-to-machine and human-to-machine with real-time interactive applications such as holographic teleportation communications and tactile Internet and haptic, multi-sensory extended reality (XR), which includes augmented reality (AR) mixed reality (MR), and virtual reality (VR), as well as support Internet of smart things (IoST) applications [423].

Hence, future 6G networks need to support these applications with extremely high data rates and diverse quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. The ultra-low transmission latency requirements could be ranging from one to a few milliseconds end-to-end latency while the ultra-reliability communication could be higher than 99.9999%. Age of Information (AoI) is a new concept related to URLLC, which is introduced recently in order to characterize the status update quality of channel information and measure latency as observed by the control layer. AoI can be considered as an efficient indication tool for measuring the delay in real-time applications.

        <p>• key points related to the smart healthcare Smart healthcare systems allow doctors to remotely monitor the patients. Further, the progression of patients' disease can also be monitored [451]. Smart healthcare systems help in disease detection, diagnosis, recognition, prediction, prevention, and treatments. The heterogeneous data collection from different devices and sensors can be stored and analyzed so that the doctors can easily access the patients' records. However, such large amounts of real-time data may lead to what known as a big data challenge [451]. Therefore, new feasible solutions and algorithms are required to deal with such a vast amount of heterogeneous real-time data. In addition, artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques can be exploited to analyze data, increase reliability and accuracy, allow real-time fast processing and make smart decisions [454]. The work in [455] proposes a smart ehealth gateway based on IoT, which can be used to address some of the communication challenges related to healthcare systems such as interoperability, reliability, security, and scalability. Therefore, future 6G networks aim to exploit a smart healthcare system to allow easy remote diagnos-tics where the patients can be diagnosed and treated even though they are physically located far away from hospitals and clinics, i.e., at their homes. Another potential of 6G networks is to allow remote surgery. Future 6G networks are expected to adopt advanced technologies to assist medical care and in-home remote monitoring. Future 6G networks are visioned to advance the current healthcare systems to allow further decentralization, and improve security and privacy performances. Future 6G networks aim to achieve more harmonious human-machine interaction and a more efficient medical process. However, healthcare applications are delaysensitive and require extremely ultra-reliable communications.

Security and privacy issues are essential for IoMT, which is needed to protect the patient's data. However, the use of the IoMT system for diagnosis may raise several challenges related to the accuracy of clinical guidelines, as well as medico-legal and ethical concerns [454]. Fog/edge computing networks are promising techniques that can be used to address some of the challenges in healthcare systems [456]. The Internet of Nano things (IoNT) concept has been introduced in [457], which has the potential to drive innovation in smart healthcare applications [456]. This is attributed to the limited size of devices and sensors, i.e., microscales and nanoscales, which can be easily distributed, implanted, attached on or close to a human body [438]. These IoNT devices and sensors can be cooperated and connected together through a unified network and performed different signal processing tasks. Motivated by the advancement in the field of nanotechnology and synthetic biology, the Internet of Bio-Nano thing (IoBNT) concept has been recently introduced as a viable solution for smart healthcare systems [438]. Therefore, molecular communication has been proposed as a key enabling technique for IoBNT, whereby biochemical molecules can be exploited to encode, transfer and receive information among nanodevices [458], [459].

        <p>• key points related to the edge computing Mobile edge computing (MEC) is considered as an important type of edge computing platform that located on the edge of a cellular network and can rapidly process large amounts of data upon receipt [498], [499]. The key concept of MEC is to move part of the service-specific processing, computing, and data storage from the centralized cloud core network to edge network nodes, which can be located near data providers and end-users [476], [500]. Several intensive computation services can be offloaded to MEC, which consists from network of servers [497]. Thus, MEC is considered as a key enabling technology to achieve URLLC, traffic optimization, enhancing the performance of 6G networks [476]. Using MEC in 6G yields a significant improvement in network capacity completes critical delaysensitive tasks and accomplishes network-intensive computations. MEC can be used as an effective solution to extend the battery life in mobile devices and reduce the network energy consumption since huge mobile applications with highly demanding signal processing can be offloaded to MEC [105]. MEC is responsible for enhancing the network capabilities and management, improving services, achieving energy and resource management, and reducing the load on the backhaul [499]. Cisco has recently introduced the idea of fog computing, which is similar to MEC. In a fog computing network, the definition of edge devices becomes wider [500], [501]. All these essential tasked with MEC can be accomplished based on a virtualized software-based platform that makes use of network functions virtualization (NFV) [502] and software-defined networks (SDN) [503]. NFV allows a single edge computing server to provide several mobile devices with computing services. This is achieved by creating multiple virtual machines that able to conduct several tasks simultaneously or operate various network functions [504]. In addition, NFV has the potential to manage computing services and enhance the reliability, scalability, and flexibility of the network services [502]. On the other hand, SDN allows the MEC network to dynamically managing different services. It also has the potential to decouple control and data plane [503], [505]- [507]. SDN can provide a logically centralized control platform to the edge computing network [508]. Using such centralized control platform would allow easier management of data traffic within the network, achieve optimal resource allocation, address the scalability issue in the network, reduce overhead, improve the reliability of the network, and most importantly reduced the latency.• key points related to the edge computing Mobile edge computing (MEC) is considered as an important type of edge computing platform that located on the edge of a cellular network and can rapidly process large amounts of data upon receipt [498], [499]. The key concept of MEC is to move part of the service-specific processing, computing, and data storage from the centralized cloud core network to edge network nodes, which can be located near data providers and end-users [476], [500]. Several intensive computation services can be offloaded to MEC, which consists from network of servers [497]. Thus, MEC is considered as a key enabling technology to achieve URLLC, traffic optimization, enhancing the performance of 6G networks [476]. Using MEC in 6G yields a significant improvement in network capacity completes critical delaysensitive tasks and accomplishes network-intensive computations. MEC can be used as an effective solution to extend the battery life in mobile devices and reduce the network energy consumption since huge mobile applications with highly demanding signal processing can be offloaded to MEC [105]. MEC is responsible for enhancing the network capabilities and management, improving services, achieving energy and resource management, and reducing the load on the backhaul [499]. Cisco has recently introduced the idea of fog computing, which is similar to MEC. In a fog computing network, the definition of edge devices becomes wider [500], [501]. All these essential tasked with MEC can be accomplished based on a virtualized software-based platform that makes use of network functions virtualization (NFV) [502] and software-defined networks (SDN) [503]. NFV allows a single edge computing server to provide several mobile devices with computing services. This is achieved by creating multiple virtual machines that able to conduct several tasks simultaneously or operate various network functions [504]. In addition, NFV has the potential to manage computing services and enhance the reliability, scalability, and flexibility of the network services [502]. On the other hand, SDN allows the MEC network to dynamically managing different services. It also has the potential to decouple control and data plane [503], [505]- [507]. SDN can provide a logically centralized control platform to the edge computing network [508]. Using such centralized control platform would allow easier management of data traffic within the network, achieve optimal resource allocation, address the scalability issue in the network, reduce overhead, improve the reliability of the network, and most importantly reduced the latency.</p>

        <p>• Key points related to the deep learning technique Deep learning is considered as a special method of machine learning, which makes use of large multi-layers artificial neural networks (ANNs). Deep learning techniques are classified into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning [516], [519], [525]- [527], as shown in Fig. 16. Each one of these techniques has its unique features. For example, in supervised learning, the labeled training data sets, which should be known beforehand, are required. Typically, supervised learning needs a large number of data sets (pairs of input and desired output) to be trained. In contrast, in unsupervised learning, the labeled data sets are not needed, which aims to infer features in the data sets. Finally, data sets that are obtained from implementation rather than historical data sets are needed in reinforcement learning, which allows the learning agents to learn from experience. In reinforcement learning, at every step, the learning agents observe the state of the environment, perform an action or make a satiable decision and then move to the next stage. Reinforcement learning is considered to be more feasible for dynamic wireless communications systems [524], [528]. Deep learning is a powerful technique that can be useful for speech recognition, wireless optimization and image processing [529]. Deep learning can also be efficiently used in numeral recognition, features extraction, and in many signal processing applications [530]- [532]. Furthermore, deep learning can be utilized in joint radar communications sys-tems. It can effectively be used to allocate the required resources dynamically with a reduced overhead [56]. Deep learning has the potential to address the challenges related to the channel estimation in high frequency and high mobility scenarios. Besides, deep learning can be exploited for data compression, dimensionality reduction regression, clustering, classification, density estimation, and data recovery. For example, deep learning can be used in data compression by extracting the most significant features from a specific data. Hence, such efficient features extraction using deep learning method can be utilized to identify the compressed data with high accuracy. As such, the data size and end-toend latency can be significantly reduced. In addition. deep learning is considered an essential tool for addressing many technical challenges related to UAVs-based communications systems. Deep learning is also a promising method for addressing many technical challenges related to wireless AR, MR, and VR. Deep learning technique is expected to play an essential role in the design of mobile edge caching and computing approaches. Deep learning has the potential to encode the data automatically by jointly learning transmitter and receiver implementations [533]. These tasks can be accomplished without any prior knowledge. Deep learning can guarantee performance improvements in complex communications scenarios, which are challenging to be described with tractable mathematical models. For example, deep learning has been considered in [534] for blind detection in MIMO communications systems with low-resolution quantization. In [535], a deep learning method has been used for solving resource management problems in wireless communication systems. Recently, deep learning has been investigated for signal compression [536], channel decoding [537], channel coding [538], improve the estimation quality of a massive MIMO system in single carrier modulation [539] and in multicarrier modulation [540] and modulation recognition networks [541]. Furthermore, in [542]- [544], hybrid precoding for mmWave massive MIMO communications systems has been investigated using a deep learning approach. The results showed that the deep learning approach improves the communication system performance and allows less computation time in comparison with conventional techniques. In addition, deep learning technique can be exploited to accomplish different tasks for compressing sensing [545], [546]. Deep learning technique can also be jointly combined with the traditional optimization theory to speed up the computation of the optimal resources in wireless communications networks.
