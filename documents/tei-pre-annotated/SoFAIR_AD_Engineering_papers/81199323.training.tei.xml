        <p>Results: Resazurin (a redox sensitive dye) microplate assay was used for measuring growth inhibition of bacteria treated with MgO nanoparticles. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of MgO nanoparticles to 10 4 colony-forming unit/ml (CFU/ml) of Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Salmonella Enteritidis were determined to be 0.5, 1 and 1 mg/ml, respectively. To completely inactivate 10 8-9 CFU/ml bacterial cells in 4 h, a minimal concentration of 2 mg/ml MgO nanoparticles was required for C. jejuni whereas E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella Enteritidis required at least 8 mg/ml nanoparticles. Scanning electron microscopy examination revealed clear morphological changes and membrane structural damage in the cells treated with MgO nanoparticles. A quantitative real-time PCR combined with ethidium monoazide pretreatment confirmed cell membrane permeability was increased after exposure to the nanoparticles. In a cell free assay, a low level (1.1 μM) of H 2 O 2 was detected in the nanoparticle suspensions. Consistently, MgO nanoparticles greatly induced the gene expression of KatA, a sole catalase in C. jejuni for breaking down H 2 O 2 to H 2 O and O 2 .Results: Resazurin (a redox sensitive dye) microplate assay was used for measuring growth inhibition of bacteria treated with MgO nanoparticles.

        <p>Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Salmonella are the most common foodborne pathogens responsible for millions of cases of illnesses and hundreds of deaths each year in the United States [1]. C. jejuni is a spiral shaped and oxygen-sensitive microaerophile, whereas E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella are rod shaped and facultative anaerobic bacteria [2]. The main natural reservoirs for these bacteria are intestinal tracts of birds (e.g. chicken) and other animals (e.g. cattle) [3][4][5]. Transmission of these pathogens from animal feces or the environment to food can occur during harvesting, processing, distribution, and preparation of food. Pathogen contamination has been frequently found in various food products including meat, fresh produce, dairy products, and ready-to-eat foods. The sporadic prevalence of microbial pathogens in food and increased incidence of antibiotic resistant strains have posed serious concerns to public health [6,7]. Hence, there is a need to develop alternative strategies for effective control of microbial pathogens in food and the environment.Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Salmonella are the most common foodborne pathogens responsible for millions of cases of illnesses and hundreds of deaths each year in the United States [1].

        <p>Metal oxide nanoparticles such as ZnO, MgO, CuO, CaO, Ag 2 O, and TiO 2 are a new class of antimicrobial agents that have been increasingly studied for their antibacterial properties and potential applications in food, the environment, and healthcare [8,9]. As nanoscale (&lt;100 nm) inorganic materials, metal oxide nanoparticles have distinct features including broad spectrum antibacterial activity, large surface area of interaction with cells, low possibility for bacteria to develop resistance, high stability even under harsh conditions, and tunable sizes, shapes, surface properties, and chemical compositions, which lead to great potential for developing nanomaterials as effective antimicrobial agents. Among these, nanostructured MgO is particularly interesting due to its strong antibacterial activity, but high thermal stability and low cost.Metal oxide nanoparticles such as ZnO, MgO, CuO, CaO, Ag 2 O, and TiO 2 are a new class of antimicrobial agents that have been increasingly studied for their antibacterial properties and potential applications in food, the environment, and healthcare [8,9].

        <p>The mechanism of metal oxide nanoparticle action on bacteria is complicated and not fully understood. It has been reported that the antibacterial activity of MgO nanoparticles is attributed to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which induce lipid peroxidation in bacteria [10]. In contrast, non-ROS mediated bacterial toxicity was also found in MgO nanoparticles, suggesting oxidative stress might not be the primary mechanism of cell death [11]. Furthermore, the antibacterial effect not only depends upon the sizes, shapes, chemical composition, and surface properties (e.g. hydrophobicity) of the nanoparticles, but also varies with bacterial species [12,13]. Several studies have shown that smaller particles have greater antibacterial activity due to higher reactive surface area [9]. However, aggregations of very small nanoparticles (~5 nm) could reduce the efficiency of interaction with bacteria. It also has been reported that MgO and CuO nanoparticles had substantially higher antibacterial activities on Gram-positive (G+) than Gram-negative (G-) bacteria, presumably due to the differences in cell membrane structure between these organisms. Our previous study showed that ZnO nanoparticles displayed extremely strong activity against C. jejuni compared to E. coli O157:H7 or Salmonella likely due to the different tolerances of these organisms to oxidative stress induced by nanoparticles [13].The mechanism of metal oxide nanoparticle action on bacteria is complicated and not fully understood.

        <p>Cytotoxicity is a major concern in the development of antimicrobial agents. MgO has been used as a mineral supplement for magnesium, an essential nutrient for the human body. As a medicine, MgO is used for the relief of cardiovascular disease and stomach problems. At low concentrations (0.3 mg/ml), MgO nanoparticles were reported to not be toxic to human cells [14]. However, toxic effects are greatly dependent on the physical and chemical properties of nanoparticles as well as the types of cells tested [15,16]. Hence, extensive evaluation of nanoparticles on different biological systems is needed to determine the toxicity of nanoparticles. Understanding of the mechanism of nanoparticle action on bacteria could provide useful guidelines for rational design and assembly of effective antibacterial derivatives. Advanced strategies, such as packaging multiple antimicrobial agents into the same nanoparticle, coating nanoparticles with biodegradable materials, and engineering target-specific nanoparticles for delivery to infection site, have emerged to improve antimicrobial activities and reduce undesirable side effects of nanoparticles.Cytotoxicity is a major concern in the development of antimicrobial agents.

        <p>The viability of C. jejuni, E. coli O157:H7, and S. Enteritidis when exposed to varying concentrations of MgO nanoparticles was determined using an oxidation-reduction assay. Resazurin, a redox sensitive dye, was used to indicate cell viability. Metabolically active cells reduce the non-fluorescent blue resazurin to fluorescent red resorufin. Non-living cells do not reduce the resazurin, and thus indicate cell death. This visible change in color and fluorescence indicates the cells are viable. Freshly grown and diluted bacterial cultures in MH broth (approx. 10 4 CFU/ ml) were exposed to MgO nanoparticles at concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 8 mg/ml.

Enteritidis to 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 mg/ml MgO nanoparticles over a set time trial (Fig. 2). Live cells were measured by the colony forming units on MH agar. At a concentration of 2 mg/ml MgO nanoparticles, C. jejuni was reduced 6 orders of magnitude after 2 h and completely killed after 4 h. At 4 mg/ml, C. jejuni was completely killed within 1 h. On the contrary, 8 mg/ ml MgO nanoparticles were required to kill all E. coli O157:H7 and S. Enteritidis cells in 4 h and 4 mg/ml in 6 h. In addition, E. coli O157:H7 could also be killed by 2 mg/ml in 8 h, whereas S. Enteritidis was only reduced 5 logs after the same exposure. This demonstrates again that MgO nanoparticles are effective at killing C. jejuni at low concentrations in short periods of time. They are also advantageous at killing E. coli O157:H7 and S. Enteritidis within 4 h.The observed antimicrobial effect was further investigated by exposing 10 8 CFU/ml C. jejuni and 10 9 CFU/ml E. coli O157:H7 and S.

        <p>To explore antimicrobial mechanism of the nanoparticles, scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the morphological and membrane structure changes of C. jejuni, E. coli O157:H7, and S. Enteritidis induced by MgO nanoparticles. Bacterial cells in late-log growth were treated with sub-lethal doses of MgO nanoparticles (1 and 2 mg/ml) for 4 h and collected for SEM study. Both treated and untreated cells were incubated under the same conditions and analyzed by SEM in parallel in order to observe the differences between the control and cells exposed to nanoparticles. SEM images in Fig. 3 show all of the untreated cells have intact and smooth surfaces. As expected, C. jejuni cells are spiral-shaped, whereas E. coli O157:H7 and S. Enteritidis are rod-shaped. After incubation with a sub-lethal concentration of nanoparticles, C. jejuni cells underwent significant morphological changes from spiral to coccoid form, but E. coli O157:H7 and S. Enteritidis remained rod shaped. Noticeably, all of the treated cells displayed some deep craters on their membrane surface, indicating a degree of membrane structure damage. These cells appear to be shorter and more compact, suggesting there could be some leakage of the cellular contents caused by the treatment. No cell lysis was noticed after the treatment of sub-lethal concentrations of nanoparticles.To explore antimicrobial mechanism of the nanoparticles, scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the morphological and membrane structure changes of C. jejuni, E. coli O157:H7, and S.

        <p>To further investigate the effect of MgO nanoparticles on cell membrane integrity and permeability, ethidium monoazide-qPCR assay was employed. Ethidium monoazide (EMA) is a DNA-binding intercalator that enters cells through compromised membranes. After photo crosslinking, the intercalation between EMA and cellular DNA becomes irreversible due to the formation of intermolecular covalent bonds. The EMA-bound DNA cannot be amplified by PCR, thus indicating membrane damage. The membrane permeability of C. jejuni after exposure to 1 and 2 mg/ml MgO nanoparticles for 4 h was assessed by EMA-qPCR assay. The results in Fig. 4 show that cells exposed to MgO nanoparticles had a nearly 1-log reduction in DNA amplification, indicating EMA penetration via damaged membranes. Similar experiments were performed on E. coli O157:H7 and S. Enteritidis cells after exposure to 2 and 4 mg/ml MgO nanoparticles. The effects of membrane leakage by MgO nanoparticles were less noticeable compared to C. jejuni (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that MgO nanoparticles increase cell membrane permeability and that C. jejuni is more susceptible to the membrane damage than E. coli O157:H7 and S.

        <p>To study the molecular mechanism of MgO nanoparticle action on bacteria, expression of the genes involved in oxidative and general stress defenses was examined in C. jejuni. Late-log phase cells exposed to 1 mg/ml MgO nanoparticles for 30 min were collected for transcription analysis. Transcripts/mRNAs of these genes were prepared and quantified by reverse transcription-qPCR. In response to the treatment, the expression of oxidative stress response genes katA (encoding catalase), ahpC (encoding alkyl hydroperoxide reductase), and dps (encoding bacterioferritin) were upregulated 44-, 5-and 4-fold, respectively (Fig. 5). In addition, general stress response gene spoT [encoding a bifunctional (p) ppGpp synthetase/hydrolase] was also expressed 22-fold higher. As controls, transcriptions of housekeeping genes gyrA, tsf, and 16 s rRNA were not significantly affected. katA is the sole catalase gene present in C. jejuni and is essential for resistance to hydrogen peroxide [22]. spoT is a stringent response gene required for survival under high O 2 [23]. Dramatic increase of the catalase gene (katA) and stringent response gene (spoT) expression in response to treatment strongly suggests MgO nanoparticles induce oxidative stress in C. jejuni cells. To survive, bacteria regulate their detoxification system by increasing their level of oxidative stress defense proteins as well as some of the general stress response proteins.To study the molecular mechanism of MgO nanoparticle action on bacteria, expression of the genes involved in oxidative and general stress defenses was examined in C. jejuni.

        <p>To further investigate the causes of oxidative stress in bacteria by MgO nanoparticles, we measured hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) produced in nanoparticle suspensions by using the highly sensitive Red Hydrogen Peroxide assay kit (with sensitivity as low as 10 pmol). H 2 O 2 contains a highly reactive oxygen species and is able to penetrate into cells to cause oxidative stress. Since H 2 O 2 is the most unstable form of reactive oxygen species, all the nanoparticle suspensions and H 2 O 2 standard solutions were freshly prepared for the study. The levels of H 2 O 2 produced in nanoparticle suspensions were determined by scanning the absorbance of resorufin fluorescence between 475 and 600 nm wavelengths and shown in Fig. 6. Referenced to the fluorescent absorbance of known concentrations of H 2 O 2 standards (0.12, 0.37, 1.1, 3.3 and 10 μM), the H 2 O 2 released in MgO nanoparticle suspension was estimated to be ca. 1.1 μM. In the same assay, a low level of H 2 O 2 (ca. 0.12 μM) was also detected in ZnO nanoparticle suspensions, suggesting the H 2 O 2 generated from MgO/ZnO nanoparticles contributed to antibacterial activity by inducing oxidative stress in cells.To further investigate the causes of oxidative stress in bacteria by MgO nanoparticles, we measured hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) produced in nanoparticle suspensions by using the highly sensitive Red Hydrogen Peroxide assay kit (with sensitivity as low as 10 pmol).

        <p>In this study, we have shown that MgO nanoparticles have a strong antimicrobial activity against three major foodborne pathogens from both the microplate-based resazurin assay and viable cell count method. The use of visible color change of resazurin from blue to red as an indicator of cell growth not only made the detection simple and fast, but allowed us to avoid the turbidity problem of insoluble nanoparticles interfering with cell optical density measurements. By using this assay, we determined that the minimal inhibitory concentrations of MgO nanoparticles against 10 4 CFU/ml of C. jejuni and E. coli O157:H7/Salmonella were 0.5 and 1 mg/ml, respectively. This is reasonably close to the result reported by Krishnamoorthy et al. [24] which showed the MIC of MgO nanoparticles (average size 25 μM) to 5 × 10 5 CFU/ml of E. coli was 0.5 mg/ml. The slight variances of the MICs found in these studies might be due to the size and/or shape variations of the nanoparticles or the different numbers of cells used.In this study, we have shown that MgO nanoparticles have a strong antimicrobial activity against three major foodborne pathogens from both the microplate-based resazurin assay and viable cell count method.

        <p>By viable cell count, we found at least 2 mg/ml nanoparticles (equivalent to 1.3 × 10 14 of 20 nm size and sphere-shaped MgO nanoparticles per ml) were required to completely inactivate 10 8 CFU/ml of C. jejuni, and 4 mg/ml was the minimal amount of nanoparticles needed to kill 10 9 CFU/ml of E. coli O157:H7 or Salmonella. Apparently, higher concentrations of MgO nanoparticles were required to inactivate increased numbers of bacterial cells. Also, C. jejuni cells were found to be more susceptible to the nanoparticles than E. coli O157:H7 or Salmonella.By viable cell count, we found at least 2 mg/ml nanoparticles (equivalent to 1.3 × 10 14 of 20 nm size and sphere-shaped MgO nanoparticles per ml) were required to completely inactivate 10 8 CFU/ml of C. jejuni, and 4 mg/ml was the minimal amount of nanoparticles needed to kill 10 9 CFU/ml of E. coli O157:H7 or Salmonella.

        <p>In this study, we chose C. jejuni, a microaerophilic bacterium, as a model organism to study the expression of stress defense genes. C. jejuni is extremely sensitive to oxidative stress due to the lack of SoxRS and OxyR, the most important regulatory proteins of oxidative stress defense in E. coli and Salmonella. It has been known that C. jejuni uses a number of enzymes including KatA, SodB, AhpC, Dps, Tpx, and Bcp to detoxify a low level of endogenous H 2 O 2 produced during cell metabolism and as a defense to the oxidative stresses potentially encountered in a host and the environment [25]. To better understand bacterial cell responses to the nanoparticle treatment, we selected a number of genes associated with oxidative stress and general stress defenses as targets of transcriptional study. Of the important anti-oxidative stress proteins in C. jejuni, KatA is the only catalase and primary enzyme for decomposing H 2 O 2 to H 2 O and O 2 ; AhpC is the secondary enzyme for reducing H 2 O 2 and is responsible for removal of low level of H 2 O 2 from cells; and Dps protects cellular DNA from oxidative damage [26][27][28].In this study, we chose C. jejuni, a microaerophilic bacterium, as a model organism to study the expression of stress defense genes.

        <p>From transcriptional analysis of the stress response genes, we found the expression of katA, ahpC, and dps were significantly increased in response to a sub-lethal concentration of MgO nanoparticle treatment. Interestingly, the same set of stress response genes (katA, ahpC, and dps) were also found expressed at higher levels in the C. jejuni cells treated with 1 mM H 2 O 2 [29]. H 2 O 2 is highly reactive to cell biomolecules (e.g. DNA, proteins, and lipids) and causes oxidative stress in bacteria when present at high concentrations. Severe or continuous oxidative stress could result in failure of the cellular defense system and cell death. By using a highly sensitive cell-free assay, we detected approximately 0.12 and 1. that the production of H 2 O 2 from nanoparticles is not the sole mechanism for the antibacterial activity of MgO/ ZnO nanoparticles. SEM analysis showed considerable cell morphology change and membrane disruption in the cells treated with MgO nanoparticles. Furthermore, the EMA-qPCR results provided from this study confirmed that MgO nanoparticles increased membrane permeability in the bacteria which likely resulted in the leakage of cell content. Our previous study showed ZnO nanoparticles had remarkable anti-Campylobacter activity with the MIC 8-16 fold lower than E. coli and Salmonella [13] In this study, we did not find significant differences of MgO nanoparticles in inhibiting growth or inactivating cells between C. jejuni, E. coli O157:H7, and S. Enteritidis. However, the effects of ZnO and MgO nanoparticles on triggering cell morphology change, membrane leakage, and oxidative stress, were found to be similar, suggesting the modes of actions of these nanoparticles on bacteria might be similar but not exactly the same.From transcriptional analysis of the stress response genes, we found the expression of katA, ahpC, and dps were significantly increased in response to a sub-lethal concentration of MgO nanoparticle treatment.

        <p>On the basis of these findings, we propose multiple mechanisms for the action of MgO nanoparticles on bacteria: (1) MgO nanoparticles continuously generate a certain level of H 2 O 2 while in suspension, which induces oxidative stress in cells; (2) physical interaction between nanoparticles and cell surface disrupts bacterial membrane integrity and causes membrane leakage; (3) higher concentrations of nanoparticles lead to severe membrane damage, cell content release, irreversible oxidization of biomolecules (e.g. DNA. proteins, and lipids), and ultimately cell death.On the basis of these findings, we propose multiple mechanisms for the action of MgO nanoparticles on bacteria: (1) MgO nanoparticles continuously generate a certain level of H 2 O 2 while in suspension, which induces oxidative stress in cells; (2) physical interaction between nanoparticles and cell surface disrupts bacterial membrane integrity and causes membrane leakage; (3) higher concentrations of nanoparticles lead to severe membrane damage, cell content release, irreversible oxidization of biomolecules (e.g. DNA. proteins, and lipids), and ultimately cell death.</p>
