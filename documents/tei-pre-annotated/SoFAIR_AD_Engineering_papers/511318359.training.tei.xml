[20] Among these polymer-based sensors, hydrogel optical fibers are a promising technology for quantifying glucose for biomedical applications due to their biocompatibility and capability to incorporate functional groups for sensing. [19] For instance, optical polymer fibers based on fluorescent sensing have been reported for quantitative glucose measurements.

        <p>The light-guiding efficiency of an optical fiber is determined by light loss at the interface between the core material and surrounding cladding. To maximize light propagation, the core should possess ha igher RI than the cladding, and both should have high light transmission. The light attenuation and RIs of p(PEGDA), p(AM-co-PEGDA), and Ca alginate were measured. Figure 1a shows the light transmission at 532 nm through hydrated p(PEGDA) matrix (1 × 1 × 1 cm 3 , 10-90 vol%). The minimum of the data points indicated polymerization-induced phase separation due to the immiscibility of PEGDA with water (20-60 vol%) (Figure S1, Supporting Information).

        <p>Monomer solution was injected into a poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) tube that served as a mold (Figure 2a). The monomer solution within the mold was exposed to a UV light for crosslinking (Figure 2b). Scheme S1 in the Supporting Information shows the polymerization process of the monomer solution. The hydrogel fiber core was ejected from the mold by applying water pressure (Figure 2c). The hydrogel core was submerged in a Na alginate solution, followed by a CaCl 2 solution (100 mmol L -1 ) to form a Ca alginate hydrogel cladding. The fabrication process was ≈5 min, the synthesized hydrogel was immediately ready for use as an optical fiber by coupling with laser light (Figure 2d). The incorporation of fluorescent dye-conjugated red and green beads to the core and the cladding enabled the visualization of the hydrogel fiber assembly (Figure 2e). This fabrication process allowed for synthesizing a range of hydrogel fiber cores with different thicknesses from 200 µm to 2.0 mm (Figure 2f). Hydrogel fibers having 200 µm diameters are thinner than the sensing probe diameters of commercial CGM systems (250-400 µm) (Table S1, Supporting Information). The contraction of the hydrogel fibers upon polymerization ranged from 3.21 to 6.49%. The thickness of Ca alginate cladding (50-100 µm) increased 3.69 ± 3.67 µm as the concentration of Na alginate increased from 1.0 to 4.0 wt% (Figure 2f inset). To analyze the mechanical properties of the hydrogel fibers, the tensile strain was measured (Figure 2g). As the diameter decreased from 2.0 mm to 200 µm, the tensile strain of p(AM-co-PEGDA) (97:3 mol%) and p(PEGDA) fibers increased from 0.13 to 0.74 mm mm -1 and from 0.13 to 0.47 mm mm -1 , respectively. As compared to p(PEGDA), the tensile strain of the fibers (Ø = 200 µm) was higher in p(AMco-PEGDA), where AM comonomer rendered the fiber elastic. As the p(AM-co-PEGDA) diameter decreased from 2.0 mm (4 of 11) 1606380 to 200 µm, the maximum load at maximum tensile stress increased from 2.8 to 9.5 MPa and modulus decreased from 27 to 20 MPa (Figure S4, Supporting Information).

        <p>The effectiveness of Ca alginate claddings for light guiding were tested by measuring the reduction in scattered light intensity over the hydrogel fiber lengths. Laser light (532 nm, 1 mW) was focused on the tip of hydrogel fibers (length = 6 cm) with and without cladding in air (Figure 3a). Noncladded hydrogel cores guided the light with significant scattering (Figure 3b). However, cladded hydrogel fibers efficiently guided the light over 20 cm (Figure 3c). The analysis of light intensity profile of scattered light showed that the light loss of the cladded hydrogel fiber ranged from 1 to 6 dB cm -1 ; however, the bare fiber core light loss was within 2-11 dB cm -1 . Light propagation loss at 532 nm was comparable to 491 nm light (Figure S5, Supporting Information). Figure 3d shows change in light attenuation for different fiber diameters. As compared to the thinner fibers, 2.0 mm core showed higher light transmission, which may be attributed to the longer ray propagation distances before reflecting off light from the core-air interface. Furthermore, light dispersion over fiber distance for the cladded fiber was consistent as compared with the noncladded fiber, which had light intensity fluctuations.The effectiveness of Ca alginate claddings for light guiding were tested by measuring the reduction in scattered light intensity over the hydrogel fiber lengths.

        <p>The light transmission of the hydrogel fibers were tested through gelatin matrices as phantom tissues. Gelatin matrices were used to visualize the light transmission throughout the hydrogel optical fibers. The hydrogel fibers (Ø = 1.0-2.0 mm) were inserted into tissue-mimicking phantom samples and the fibers were illuminated with a laser light source (λ = 532 nm) (Figure 3e). Light attenuation in fibers due to contact with the gelatin matrices was less than 10%. The light attenuation in the p(PEGDA) hydrogel fibers were also evaluated by bending tests. One end of a hydrogel fiber was kept mounted on a stand, and the hydrogel fiber was illuminated with a continuous wave laser light (I i , λ = 532 nm, 1 mW). The intensity of light at the output (I o ) was measured as the tip of the fiber was bent from 0° to 80° (Figure 3f). As the bend angle increased, the intensity of light due to bending decreased 30% at 80° (Figure 3g). The decrease in the intensity of the transmitted light due to bending might be attributed to the increase in the surface roughness, distortions, or fractures in the Ca alginate cladding.The light transmission of the hydrogel fibers were tested through gelatin matrices as phantom tissues.

        <p>The hydrogel fibers were connected to solid-state stepindex multimode fiber optic cables to launch light. Solid-state optical fiber and hydrogel optical fiber connection was created by co-polymerizing the monomer solution and a silica fiber in a PVC mold (Figure 3h). The solid-state optical fiber within the hydrogel optical fiber had a core diameter of 100 µm and NA of 0.37. The inset in Figure 3h shows a silica optical fiber coupled to a p(AM-co-PEGDA) hydrogel fiber. The hydrogelsilica fiber connection was stable when the hydrogel was fully hydrated. The resulting hydrogel optical fiber was integrated within a 21 gauge needle (inner Ø = 514 µm) for implantation in tissue (Figure 3i). The light intensity of the hydrogel fibers in the needles could be finely controlled (Figure 3j). The resulting hydrogel optical fiber was injected within porcine tissue as deep as 3 cm and was retractable after implantation (Figure 3k).

Scheme S2 in the Supporting Information shows the synthetic scheme of p(AM-co-PEGDA-co-3-APBA). As glucose molecules diffuse into the hydrogel fiber and complex (1:1) with PBA derivatives, the Donnan osmotic pressure of the system increases. Variation in the osmotic pressure, hence the hydrogel density changes the RI that affects light propagation through the hydrogel fiber (Figure 4b-d). The measurement of I o as a function of tuning the core RI can be utilized as a sensor to quantify analyte concentrations.Figure 4a shows a hydrogel optical fiber with a tunable p(AM-co-PEGDA-co-3-APBA) core and a Ca alginate cladding.

        <p>PBA derivatives complex with carbohydrates through their cis-diol groups (Scheme S3, Supporting Information). The binding between the anionic boronate species and cis-diol groups of glucose molecules is covalent. For example, polymers fabricated with dynamic covalent boronic esters were shown to undergo reversible bonding with self-healing properties. [23] The complexation equilibrium depends on the pK a of the copolymer. At acidic pH (&lt;7.0), the uncharged trigonal planar form of the PBA does not readily complex with glucose. [24] However, above the pK a point of the PBA (≈8. 6-8.8), its charged tetrahedral state reversibly binds to glucose. Hydrogel fibers consisting of 3-APBA (15 mol%) and PEGDA (3-4 mol%) were fabricated and tested in the presence of glucose in PBS (pH 7.4, 100.0 mmol L -1 , 24 °C). The complexation of the glucose with 3-APBA lowers the apparent pK a of the p(AM-co-PEGDA-co-3-APBA) system. The increase in the concentration of the anionic boronate species increases the free mixing energy and the hydrophilicity. [25] The formation of boronate anions upon glucose-3-APBA complexation increases the Donnan osmotic pressure of the hydrogel fiber. [26] The glucose sensing properties of hydrogel optical fibers were investigated. To test the 3-APBA-glucose complexation dynamics, glucose (100 mmol L -1 ) and 3-APBA (15 mol%) were used. Previously in acrylamide-based hydrogel sensors, 20 mol% 3-APBA was found to be the optimum in hydrogel-based glucose sensors. [27] Figure S8 in the Supporting Information shows that light attenuation did not change between precursors (AM:PEGDA:3-APBA, 77/3/20 mol% in DMSO) before and after filtering (0.22 µm), indicating that 3-APBA completely dissolves in DMSO. The attenuation decreased 4.6% after polymerization in DMSO. After polymerization of the precursor in aqueous solution, the light attenuation decreased by 7.5%. In comparison to 3-APBA dissolved in DMSO, light attenuation of the precursor in DI water decreased ≈24.3%. Hence, ≈15 mol% was the maximum solubility of 3-APBA in the present system in aqueous solutions. The hydrogel fibers containing 3.0 mol% PEGDA was found to be optimum, expanding the hydrogel 8.7% in diameter (Figure 5a). The fibers were fully swollen in The complexation of charged tetrahedral 3-APBA with cis diols of glucose molecules reached equilibrium in 40 min. Hydrogel fibers without the functional group 3-APBA had 0.3% expansion due to nonspecific interaction with glucose. At higher concentrations of PEGDA (3.5, 4.0 mol%), the increase in the crosslinking density decreased the elasticity of the hydrogel optical fiber, limiting the fiber expansion to ~6.7%, in the presence of glucose (100 mmol L -1 ). However, at lower concentrations of PEGDA (1.0, 2.0 mol%), the Donnan osmotic pressure effect due to ionic strength of the buffer did not significantly expanded (0.9 and 1.0%) the hydrogel fiber diameter. As the concentration of glucose within the physiological range was increased from 4.0 to 12.0 mmol L -1 , cross-section area of p(AMco-PEGDA-co-3-APBA) hydrogel fibers expanded by 6% over 1 h (Figure 5b). Figure S9 in the Supporting Information shows the hydrogel fiber diameter expansion in the presence of glucose (0-20 mmol L -1 ).

Previously in acrylamide-based hydrogel sensors, 20 mol% 3-APBA was found to be the optimum in hydrogel-based glucose sensors. [27] Figure S8 in the Supporting Information shows that light attenuation did not change between precursors (AM:PEGDA:3-APBA, 77/3/20 mol% in DMSO) before and after filtering (0.22 µm), indicating that 3-APBA completely dissolves in DMSO. The attenuation decreased 4.6% after polymerization in DMSO. After polymerization of the precursor in aqueous solution, the light attenuation decreased by 7.5%. In comparison to 3-APBA dissolved in DMSO, light attenuation of the precursor in DI water decreased ≈24.3%. Hence, ≈15 mol% was the maximum solubility of 3-APBA in the present system in aqueous solutions. The hydrogel fibers containing 3.0 mol% PEGDA was found to be optimum, expanding the hydrogel 8.7% in diameter (Figure 5a). The fibers were fully swollen in The complexation of charged tetrahedral 3-APBA with cis diols of glucose molecules reached equilibrium in 40 min. Hydrogel fibers without the functional group 3-APBA had 0.3% expansion due to nonspecific interaction with glucose. At higher concentrations of PEGDA (3.5, 4.0 mol%), the increase in the crosslinking density decreased the elasticity of the hydrogel optical fiber, limiting the fiber expansion to ~6.7%, in the presence of glucose (100 mmol L -1 ). However, at lower concentrations of PEGDA (1.0, 2.0 mol%), the Donnan osmotic pressure effect due to ionic strength of the buffer did not significantly expanded (0.9 and 1.0%) the hydrogel fiber diameter. As the concentration of glucose within the physiological range was increased from 4.0 to 12.0 mmol L -1 , cross-section area of p(AMco-PEGDA-co-3-APBA) hydrogel fibers expanded by 6% over 1 h (Figure 5b). Figure S9 in the Supporting Information shows the hydrogel fiber diameter expansion in the presence of glucose (0-20 mmol L -1 ). Increase in the concentration of the glucose in p(AM-co-PEGDA) without the functional group 3-APBA did not significantly change the hydration state of the fiber over 1 h.</p>
        <p>The area expansion of the fiber cross-section and the concentration of glucose at the boundaries C ∞ had a linear relation. Figure 5b shows the relation between ΔØ and C ∞ from 0 to 10 mmol L -1 , followed by saturation of the expansion. To model the time-dependency of the fiber expansion with respect to the concentration at the boundaries, it was assumed that fiber matrix only had charged tetrahedral state of 3-APBA with a saturation trend. By considering a uniform distribution of glucose inside the hydrogel fiber, the diffusion dynamics can be approximated as:The area expansion of the fiber cross-section and the concentration of glucose at the boundaries C ∞ had a linear relation.

        <p>The decay constant α describes the affinity of boronic acid-cis diol complexation and is correlated with the diffusion constant of the glucose-hydrogel fiber system. The α coefficient extracted from the fitted diameter expansion was 37 × 10 -5 s -1 , and the diffusion constant D was 23.75 µm 2 s -1 . This diffusion is ~4 times faster than rhodamine B (model diffusion system) due to its lower molecular weight and hydrophilicity (Figure S7, Supporting Information). Another limiting factor that contributes to the curve saturation is the elastic limit of the hydrogel fiber during expansion. The complexation between the 3-APBA and cis diols of glucose molecules depends on the apparent pK a value of the hydrogel system. To measure the apparent pK a value of the hydrogel fibers, the pH was varied at a fixed glucose concentration. As the pH of the glucose solution (12.0 mmol L -1 ) was increased up to 9.5, the fiber diameter expanded by 19% (Figure 5c).

When immersed in a buffered glucose solution (pH 7.4, 12 mmol L -1 ), the hydrogel fiber containing 3 mol% PEGDA and 15 mol% APBA formed reversible covalent bonds with glucose molecules producing a diameter expansion of 2.5% around 9 min (Figure 5d).

        <p>Potential interferents of 3-APBA-glucose complexation include carbohydrates and l-Lactate. As the buffer solution was replaced with buffered fructose solution (100 mmol L -1 , pH 7.4), the hydrogel fiber diameter linearly expanded by 8% over 2 h, showing a slower binding rate than glucose (Figure 5e). These results agree with the previous studies that showed higher affinity of boronic acid to fructose than glucose under physiological conditions. [28] Fructose blood concentrations in diabetic patients and healthy human subjects are 12.0 ± 3.8 and 8.1 ± 1.0 µmol L -1 , respectively. [29] The blood fructose concentration corresponds to 0.096% expansion over 2 h in hydrogel fibers. Another interferent, l-lactate through its α-hydroxy acids competitively binds to 3-APBA. [30] When the buffer solution was replaced with buffered lactate solution at pH 7.4, the hydrogel fibers expanded 13% over 15 min. As compared to glucose and fructose, rapid expansion of the hydrogel fibers in the presence of l-lactate can be attributed to rapid diffusion induced by its small molecular weight (M W : 90 g mol -1 ) and high affinity through its α-hydroxy acid. The concentration of blood l-lactate in healthy resting adults is 0.36-0.75 mmol L -1 . [31] This concentration corresponds to 0.047%-0.097% hydrogel fiber expansion. Hence, the competitive binding of both fructose and lactate are below 1% error in hydrogel fiber swelling.Potential interferents of 3-APBA-glucose complexation include carbohydrates and l-Lactate.

        <p>The effect of unspecific charge interactions of metal ions (ionic strength) with p(AM-co-PEGDA-co-3-APBA) dynamics were also evaluated. As the concentration of metal ions (Na + , K + , Ca 2+ , and Mg 2+ ) were increased from ion-free solution to 150 mmol L -1 , the hydrogel fiber diameter shrunk 1.5, 2.4, 0.6 and 2.9%, respectively (Figure 5f).

The combined maximum ionic strength effect of blood electrolytes corresponds to ≈1.55% shrinkage in the hydrogel fiber. In the cases of hypo/hypernateremia, the maximal hydrogel diameter changes would be ≈1.55 ± 0.14%. This shrinkage could be attributed to the nonspecific charge interactions between the metal ions and hydrogel fiber matrix, resulting in decrease in Donnan potential.

        <p>As compared to fluorescent boronic acid receptors, the measurement of light transmission based sensing is not prone to photobleaching. [13c] In contrast to the photonic crystal sensors that only expand in z-direction, hydrogel optical fibers expand isotropically. [26] Unlike enzymatic reactions involving glucose oxidase or hexokinase-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, [34] 3-APBA molecules competitively bind to cis diols of carbohydrates (e.g., fructose) as well as lactate through its α-hydroxy acids. [30] While 3-APBA was demonstrated as a model ligand for glucose in the present work, selectivity can be improved by co-polymerizing tertiary/quaternary amine monomers (e.g., (3-acrylamidopropyl)trimethylammonium) with PBA derivatives. [35] Alternatively, PBA derivatives such as 2-acrylamido-5-fluorophenylboronic acid, [8] 2-(acrylamido) phenylboronate, [36] 4-vinylphenylboronic acid (4-VPBA), [37] or their copolymers [38] can be used to enhance the selectivity of the hydrogel fiber sensors to glucose. Electron-withdrawing substituents may increase the sensor response by decreasing the pK a of PBA. [26] One of the factors that affected the sensing time was the diffusion rate of the glucose molecules into the optical hydrogel fibers. Other phenylboronic acid functionalized high-surface area copolymer geometries such as microgel particles [11,39] and porous thin films [40] can be utilized to improve the responsivity to glucose within the hydrogel optical fiber platform for achieving faster equilibrium. Furthermore, co-monomers can be utilized with volume resetting agents to provide linear response to glucose. [41] Additionally, the boric acid group of the hydrogel optical fibers is pH dependent. However, for diagnostics applications, the pH of the interstitial fluid is tightly regulated by bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4). When acid-base homeostasis is not balanced, for example, in acidosis, interstitial pH can decrease below 7.35; and in alkalosis, pH of the interstitial fluid may exceed 7.45. Hence, coupling the phenylboronic acid sensor with a pH sensor may allow the compensation of the pH error in measurements. [42] To improve the mechanical properties of hydrogel optical fibers, highly stretchable alginate-polyacrylamide hydrogels may be adopted. [43] Additionally, the development of robust cladding polymers that can bind to the core covalently will improve the efficiency of light transmission in vivo. [44] Intensity-based readout in quantitative measurements is associated with potential light loss through fiber bending. This may be mitigated by employing sophisticated photonic sensing schemes such as whispering-gallery mode analysis [20a] and diffraction gratings. [45] The glucose-induced swelling of the hydrogel matrix with embedded gratings can change lattice spacing and/ or RI to produce Bragg peak shifts for quantitative analysis. [46] Additionally, the presented hydrogel optical fibers can be functionalized with chelating agents, proteins, oligomers, nanopores, and channel-based membranes to be responsive to a wide range of analytes for sensing and drug delivery applications.

[46] Additionally, the presented hydrogel optical fibers can be functionalized with chelating agents, proteins, oligomers, nanopores, and channel-based membranes to be responsive to a wide range of analytes for sensing and drug delivery applications. [47] Hydrogel optical fibers show potential for label-free optical sensing toward continuous in vivo glucose monitoring systems for diabetes patients at clinical and point-of-care settings.</p>
