        <p>Flamelet based chemical reduction techniques are very promising methods for efficient and accurate modeling of premixed flames. Over the years the Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) technique has been developed by the Combustion Technology Group of Eindhoven University of Technology. Current stateof-the-art of FGM for the modeling of premixed and partially-premixed flames is reviewed. The fundamental basis of FGM consists of a generalized description of the flame front in a (possibly moving) flameadapted coordinate system. The basic nature of the generalized flamelet model is that effects of strong stretch in turbulent flames are taken into account by resolving the detailed structure of flame stretch and curvature inside the flame front. The generalized flamelet model, which forms the basis on which FGM is built, is derived in Part I. To be able to validate numerical results of flames obtained with full chemistry and obtained from FGM, it is important that the generalized flamelet model is analyzed further. This is done by investigating the impact of strong stretch, curvature and preferential diffusion effects on the flame dynamics as described by the local mass burning rate. This so-called strong stretch theory is derived and analyzed in Part I, as well as multiple simplifications of it, to compare the strong stretch theory with existing stretch theories. The results compare well with numerical results for flames with thin reaction layers, but described by multiple-species transport and chemistry. This opens the way to use the generalized flamelet model as a firm basis for applying FGM in strongly stretched laminar and turbulent flames in Part II. The complete FGM model is derived first and the use of FGM in practice is reviewed. The FGM model is then validated by studying effects of flame stretch, heat loss, and changes in elements, as well as NO formation. The application to direct numerical simulations of turbulent flames is subsequently studied and validated using the strong stretch theory. It is shown that the generalized flamelet model still holds even in case of strong stretch and curvature effects, at least as long as the reaction layer is dominated by reaction and diffusion phenomena and not perturbed too much by stretch related perturbations. The FGM model then still performs very well with a low number of control variables. Turbulent flames with strong preferential diffusion effects can also be modeled efficiently with an FGM model using a single additional control variable for the changes in element mass fractions and enthalpy. Finally FGM is applied to the modeling of turbulent flames using LES and RANS flow solvers. For these cases, the flame front structure is not resolved anymore and unresolved terms need to be modeled. A common approach to include unresolved turbulent fluctuations is the presumed probability density function (PDF) approach. The validity of this FGM-PDF approach is discussed for a few test cases with increasing level of complexity.Flamelet based chemical reduction techniques are very promising methods for efficient and accurate modeling of premixed flames.

        <p>Detailed numerical modeling of reacting flows has gained a continuous growth of interest in the last few decades. This is related to the fact that the development of new and the improvement of existing combustion equipment is getting more and more important. It has become strikingly clear that we cannot continue with the emission of undesired polluting combustion-byproducts in the way we have been doing in the last century, as this might lead to the destruction of our complete ecosystem. Engines, gas turbines and industrial furnaces play a major role in this emission and it is therefore of the utmost importance to improve the combustion properties of these systems significantly in the near future to avoid a further pollution of the atmosphere.Detailed numerical modeling of reacting flows has gained a continuous growth of interest in the last few decades.

        <p>However, the improvement of combustion processes is a very difficult task: the improvement of one aspect often leads to a deterioration of other combustion aspects due to the complicated nature of combustion systems. For example, the shift of combustion technology during the last few decades toward much leaner low-NO x premixed combustion processes in many applications has generally evolved in a reduction of the flame stability (leading e.g., to flame oscillations, noise, CO-emissions and even flame quenching). To be able to avoid all these problems, adaptations of combustion systems were needed, and to assist these studies, combustion CFD has become a very important tool. Another example is related to the demand for more sustainable combustion which has introduced a broad range of new fuels, some of which show really different combustion phenomena, for example hydrogen enrichment of fossil fuels from bio-sources introduces preferential diffusion phenomena which may have a huge impact on the structure and dynamics of underlying combustion processes. It is clear that combustion CFD is also very important to guide these developments. Therefore, further improvements by ad-hoc measures are insufficient and we have to rely on an in-depth understanding of the processes to be able to improve these systems significantly. Detailed experiments have to be carried out and detailed numerical modeling is needed to meet this goal. However, the numerical modeling of combustion systems is also very challenging from a scientific point of view. The interaction of the fluid flow, turbulence, chemical reactions and thermodynamics in reacting flows is of exceptional complexity. At the moment it has become within reach to model the most important physical aspects in detail, but this is still limited to small academic combustion problems. The modeling of the full details of practical combustion equipment will remain prohibitive in the next few decades, because of current and future limitations in computing power.However, the improvement of combustion processes is a very difficult task: the improvement of one aspect often leads to a deterioration of other combustion aspects due to the complicated nature of combustion systems.

        <p>This problem asks for special treatments with respect to the modeling of flames. An important way to tackle this problem is by making use of the fact that the chemical time and length scales in most flames are very small. This idea can be exploited in different smart ways to reduce the number of equations to be solved, leading to an enormous reduction in computing effort. In the last decades two main routes have been followed using this idea in combustion science to model the detailed dynamics and structure of chemically reacting flows: chemical reduction techniques and laminar flamelet models.This problem asks for special treatments with respect to the modeling of flames.

        <p>Chemical reduction techniques -such as conventional reduction [1], Intrinsic Low-Dimensional Manifolds (ILDM) [2] and Computational Singular Perturbation (CSP) [3] -are based on the idea that most of the chemical time scales in the system are very small. If all transport processes are neglected, a time-scale analysis can be performed and the fastest time scales are assumed to be in steady-state. Mathematically, this means that all variables can be stored in a database as a function of a few controlling variables and during run-time only the equations for the controlling variables are solved. Large savings in computing time are reported by most methods with a small loss in accuracy.Chemical reduction techniques -such as conventional reduction [1], Intrinsic Low-Dimensional Manifolds (ILDM) [2] and Computational Singular Perturbation (CSP) [3] -are based on the idea that most of the chemical time scales in the system are very small.

        <p>Laminar flamelet methods [4] are based on the idea that flame structures are much thinner than most scales of the distortions in the flow, also implying that the chemical reactions are very fast compared to all other time scales. For that reason, the internal structure of the flame front is almost frozen while it moves around in the flow field. The dynamics of the thin flame front is then predicted by using a kinematic equation for the propagation of the flame front, the mixture fraction equation for the mixing and a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver for the flow [4].Laminar flamelet methods [4] are based on the idea that flame structures are much thinner than most scales of the distortions in the flow, also implying that the chemical reactions are very fast compared to all other time scales.

        <p>In 1999, van Oijen and de Goey proposed a combination of these approaches, referred to as the Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) technique [5,6]. The FGM approach is more accurate than chemical reduction techniques like ILDM and CSP in colder flame parts, because it also takes transport effects into account in the reduction of chemical kinetics. The correct flame dynamics and propagation speed of the flame are only captured by taking into account the balance between convection, diffusion and reaction, which is essentially not taken into account in the chemical reduction techniques like ILDM/CSP, because they are based on chemical kinetics only. In hot flame parts, chemistry dominates and ILDM/ CSP methods are accurate, but transport processes start playing an important role in the colder flame parts where chemical time scales increase, taken into account only with flamelet based methods like FGM. The FGM method is quite promising, both because of the improvement in reduction efficiency as well as in the accuracy of the model. This method is based on a detailed analysis of (partially) premixed flames in the so-called laminar flamelet and thin reaction zones combustion regime. The basis of the FGM approach is the set of strongly stretched flamelet equations and the related strong stretch theory, developed in the last decade.

        <p>In this paper, we will review the essential ingredients of the strong stretch theory and the FGM method, show results, and indicate the relation between the models and with other existing methods. Various other methods have been developed to couple diffusion and chemistry in reduction methods. Bongers et al. [7] introduced the Phase-Space ILDM (PS-ILDM) method, which analyzes the time scales of a linearized form of the flamelet equations. Reaction Diffusion Manifolds (REDIM) were introduced by Bykov and Maas [8]. Like PS-ILDM, REDIM is an extension of the ILDM framework by including diffusion terms. Furthermore, the FGM method is very similar to the Flamelet Prolongation of ILDM (FPI) technique, which was introduced by Gicquel et al. [9] in 2000. Parallel to the development of FGM, the FPI approach has been applied in many numerical combustion studies (e.g., Refs. [10][11][12]). While FGM and FPI were at first developed for premixed flames and only later applied to non-premixed flames [13,14], the Flamelet/Progress Variable (FPV) approach was introduced by Pierce and Moin [15] for application in non-premixed flames. The FPV method is based on the non-premixed flamelet model of Peters [4,16], but uses a reaction progress variable to describe non-equilibrium chemistry. Pitsch, Ihme and coworkers further developed the FPV method focusing on turbulent non-premixed flames (e.g., Refs. [17][18][19][20]). Both FPI and FPV describe the chemical kinetics with a single reaction progress variable apart from variables to account for mixing and non-adiabatic effects, while FGM has been developed to be used with multiple reaction control variables [6,13,21].In this paper, we will review the essential ingredients of the strong stretch theory and the FGM method, show results, and indicate the relation between the models and with other existing methods.

        <p>The main goal of this paper is to form one consistent picture of the FGM approach by reviewing older papers, filling the gaps with new derivations and especially to discuss the main physical consequences, which were less obvious in our previous papers. This paper contains two parts. In Part I the set of strongly stretched flamelet equations is derived on which the FGM model is based. This set of equations is further used to derive and validate the strong stretch theory. This theory is the basic formalism for describing the effects of turbulence generated stretch and curvature on the flame propagation rate and is therefore the essential link to the FGM method described in Part II. Inclusion of strong stretch is the main focus because the FGM approach is intended to predict turbulent (partially) premixed combustion in the corrugated flamelet and thin reaction zones regime of the combustion regime diagram [16].The main goal of this paper is to form one consistent picture of the FGM approach by reviewing older papers, filling the gaps with new derivations and especially to discuss the main physical consequences, which were less obvious in our previous papers.

        <p>Partially premixed flames of hydrocarbon-air mixtures generally propagate as thin layers with a thickness δf mainly determined by the balance of diffusion and reaction in the flame front. Such a thin layer contains an even thinner reaction layer with a thickness δr (with δ δ r f ) mainly determined by chemical kinetics. Turbulent flames can then be regarded as thin reaction-diffusion layers wrinkled by the turbulence, while the internal structure and the propagation speed are perturbed by flame stretch and flame curvature due to the turbulent structures. In most applications, flames are wrinkled by all turbulent scales up to the smallest Kolmogorov eddies with scale η, which can be of the order of the flame thickness δf. We therefore consider partially-premixed flames of which the smallest flow scales η satisfy η δ r while η can be of the same order of magnitude as the flame thickness, typically δ η δ f f ≤ ≤10 . This corresponds to flames in the so-called corrugated flamelet regime or the thin reaction zones regime. For this reason we can assume effectively that the reaction layer is infinitely thin (δ r → 0), while the diffusive layer is resolved.Partially premixed flames of hydrocarbon-air mixtures generally propagate as thin layers with a thickness δf mainly determined by the balance of diffusion and reaction in the flame front.

        <p>It is important to realize that most existing theories to predict the effects of flame stretch and curvature on the flame propagation speed and flame structure, which have been developed over the years [22][23][24], assume that length and time scales of the perturbations are large compared to the flame scales. These so-called weak stretch theories effectively assume that the perturbations are homogeneous on the scale of the flame front and are therefore suited for the wrinkled flamelet regime ( η δ δ f r ), but making predictions about the effects of turbulence in the regime of main practical interest, where η δ ∼ f , probably unreliable. Still, these theories have been 'extrapolated' to the more practical regimes of turbulent premixed flames by most combustion researchers, simply because a theory for the case with η δ ~f was lacking. For that reason, the authors developed an extended theory, referred to as 'strong stretch theory', indicating that the Karlovitz number Ka = τf/τη is no longer small but can be of the order 1, with τf = δf/sL the flame time and τη = η/u ′ the flow time scale, where sL is the laminar burning speed and u ′ is the velocity fluctuation of the surrounding (turbulent) flow.It is important to realize that most existing theories to predict the effects of flame stretch and curvature on the flame propagation speed and flame structure, which have been developed over the years [22][23][24], assume that length and time scales of the perturbations are large compared to the flame scales.

        <p>In the regime with η ≈ δf and δr→0, it is obvious that the flow perturbations cannot be assumed homogeneous inside the diffusive layer. The flame stretch rate and the flame curvature should therefore be resolved inside the flame front. This is the main difference between the existing weak stretch theories and our strong stretch theory. We will not assume that δf→0 thus we cannot treat the flame as an interface as in other models. We will treat the reaction layer as an interface though. There are more differences between the weak and strong stretch theories: weak stretch theories are derived for single-step kinetics between a few major species having a large activation energy while the strong stretch theory is valid for (realistic) multiple-species transport and chemistry as we will see, as long as the reaction chemistry is fast enough so that δ δ r f . This enables application to (numerical) studies of flames using realistic transport and chemistry models, like FGM. To resolve the structure of the diffusive layer, we consider a progress variable and we will evaluate the kinematic evolution of a series of isocontours of the progress variable, thereby taking the detailed interaction of fluid dynamics and transport processes inside the flame front into account. These aspects are the main ingredients of the strong stretch theory developed over the last decades [25], which forms the basis of the FGM method presented in Part II and further.

Using integral analysis we then analyze the influence of strong stretch on the flame propagation rate in Section 2.2, while the theory is validated in Section 2.3.We will first present the equations governing (partially) premixed flames in Section 2.1.2.

        <p>In this section we summarize a mathematical model for laminar, premixed flames. Typically, we consider the combustion of hydrocarbons in air. The species in the flame are numbered 1 through Ns. Species Ns is nitrogen (N2) and is present in abundance.

Here we replaced the gradient of mole fractions by a gradient of mass fractions, assuming that the gradient of mean molar mass is small [28]. For premixed flames burning in air, this is a valid assumption because M is mainly determined by the abundant N2. Furthermore, thermal diffusion is neglected in Eq. ( 2).

This set governs the impact of small and large scale fluctuations in the flow on the flame dynamics, viz. the influence of the K(s) and σ(s)-fields on the mass burning rate. To analyze the effects of stretch, curvature and preferential diffusion further, a strong stretch theory has been derived. This theory makes use of the fact that reaction layers are mostly thinner than all other scales and in the case of an infinitely thin reaction zone, the SSFE set can be used to derive analytical expressions for the influence of perturbations on the mass burning rate. These expressions in turn can be used to validate FGM which solves the SSFE set numerically without assuming that the reaction layer is infinitely thin. This strong stretch theory is derived and analyzed in this section and approximations and comparisons with other stretch theories and with numerical computations using detailed chemistry are presented in Section 2.3. Thus, we will analyze the solution of the SSFE system (29). In Section 2.2.1 we first neglect the Q-terms and the stretch terms (and insert Q = K = 0). The solution for the mass burning rate will be referred to as the mass burning rate of 'stretchless flames'. Note that this is the mass burning rate of a curved flame, since the flamelet path is generally not straight and the flame contours are curved (σ ≠ 1). This does not necessarily represent a physical flame because important stretch terms have been neglected. This procedure will just lead to a mathematical expression for the mass burning rate of stretchless flames and is a first step to derive the physically relevant stretched mass burning rate. Subsequently, in Section 2.2.2, we will analyze how the mass burning rate of stretchless flames changes into the full stretched mass burning rate if the right-hand side stretch terms are included.The SSFE set of equations forms the basis of the FGM formalism for the modeling of flames in the flamelet and thin reaction zones regime and is described further in Part II.

        <p>This approach to compute m b 0 gives the same result as the large activation energy asymptotics (LAEA) approach [27,42]. In that case, a scaling procedure is carried out for the two (preheating and reaction) zones in the flame and after expanding all terms in series of a small parameter ε inversely proportional to the activation energy, i.e., ε ∝ 1/Ea, solutions in the different zones are matched for the different orders of the parameter ε. A similar procedure can be carried out with Eq. ( 35) as follows. The solution in the preheating zone follows from Eq. ( 35) if we set S s ( ) = 0 , leading to expression (39) for the diffusive flux D b of Y at the edge of the diffusive layer and the reaction layer; cf. Eq. (38). Convective transport is small and neglected in the reaction zone. So after setting A s ( ) = 0 and multiplying Eq. (35) with D s ( ) and integrating, we find the expression (40a) for the diffusive flux D b at the edge between the two zones. Matching them gives Eq. ( 41). Physically, this can be interpreted as follows. The square root of the right-hand side integral (39) is proportional to the total amount of Y per unit flame surface area and per unit time produced or consumed in the reaction layer. Equation (39) thus expresses that the total amount of Y produced in the reaction layer leads to a diffusive flux D b of Y at the edge of the reaction layer. This flux of Y into the preheating zone has to be distributed somehow between convection and diffusion, which is expressed by Eq. (40a). Matching them fixes the mass burning rate needed for that.This approach to compute m b 0 gives the same result as the large activation energy asymptotics (LAEA) approach [27,42].

That curvature does not influence the mass burning rate of a flame with infinitely thin reaction layer is also clear from a physical point of view: the production or consumption of Y in the reaction layer leads to a flux D b of Y at the edge of the reaction layer directed toward the preheating zone. If this reaction layer is infinitely thin, this flux cannot be influenced by curvature. Convective and diffusive processes are responsible for the distribution of this 'flux' in the preheating zone. Without 'losses' (like flame stretch) in the preheating zone, this flux is equal to Eq. (40a) and independent of the structure of the preheating zone. This has already been shown by de Goey [32] who proved that the laminar burning velocity is not influenced by transport processes inside the preheating zone, as long as no losses are present. Equation (40a) expresses 'conservation' of Y in the preheating zone. It should be realized that Eq. ( 41) also shows that the way the distribution inside the preheating zone takes place is not relevant, since the expression depends on the diffusivity near the reaction layer but does not depend on the diffusivity inside the preheating zone where the source term is virtually 0. We can conclude from this that the mass burning rate of an unstretched flame is not dependent on curvature, i.e., flat, spherical or cylindrical flames all have the same m b,1 0 at the reaction layer in case of an infinitely thin reaction layer.

As the flux Db into the volume remains the same, while mass is leaking out of the volume element, this requires a smaller convective mass transport mb along the flamelet path to distribute the fuel (see Eq. ( 49)). The mass burning rate thus decreases according to Eq. ( 52). In the remainder we will refer to this as the 'direct' effect of stretch in the flame.

        <p>If we consider the same flame as in Fig. 3a, but now propagating in a mixture having a Lewis number not equal to 1, the situation changes as follows (see Fig. 3b). The amount of mass leaking away out of the volume element around the flamelet is now the same as in the previous case, so the 'direct' stretch effect is also present. However, due to the fact that diffusive fluxes are not the same, this leads to a change in element composition and enthalpy in the preheating zone. This can be understood by the simple example displayed in Fig. 3b, where two diffusive fluxes JF and JT have op-posite directions but a different magnitude. This leads to a change in element composition/enthalpy in the volume element. Diffusive fluxes are all aligned and not responsible for the change of total enthalpy/elements that the volume element and as such the flame front encounters. The local enthalpy increases inside the diffusive layer in the current example of Fig. 3b because there is a larger thermal energy flux JT into the diffusive layer than the energy carried by the flux JT out of the dashed area. Note that this unbalance of diffusive fluxes in stretchless flames leads to a local change in enthalpy/element composition inside the diffusive layer but these quantities remain conserved in a flamelet because there is no loss from the flamelet due to homogeneous flow. Since flame stretch is related to an inhomogeneous flow perpendicular to the flamelet, the non-constant convective flux ρ ξ v 2 in the current stretched flame of Fig. 3b is responsible for the loss/gain of enthalpy/elements out of the volume element through the sides of the red dashed area. Enthalpy and elements are now not conserved along a flamelet. This means that the flame temperature changes and as a result also the amount of mass of fuel consumed in the front changes, which in turn changes the flux Db into the diffusive layer.

( 54) and (55). 0 near the right flamelet, assuming the coordinate ξ 2 increases going from left to right along the flame surfaces. This again introduces a direct gain/ loss, previously indicated as the direct effect of flame stretch. As before, the diffusive fluxes have opposite directions but are of unequal strength, leading to a local change in enthalpy/elements in the diffusive layer. The enthalpy locally increases in the preheating zone in the current example as in the previous example. Again, the non-zero flow along the iso-planes of Y perturbs global con- servation. Enthalpy and flame temperature increase in the left flamelet, while the opposite is true for the right flamelet. This flame thus encounters a 'direct' stretch effect and a 'preferential diffusion' effect, and the mass burning rate is again described by Eqs.

        <p>The examples discussed in the previous subsections indicate how flame stretch influences phenomena taking place inside the diffusive layer of a flame front. It is clear that transport effects inside this layer dominate the physics. Transport effects inside the reaction layer are less important if this layer is much thinner than the preheating zone, simply because there is less time and space for transport phenomena to be of significance. We will validate these phenomena using numerical modeling in the following. However, it must be clear that this is not the first and only analysis of these phenomena, although this description is more detailed than most other theories, which are based on a flame sheet assumption and one-step chemistry (e.g., Refs.

This is indicated in Fig. 5 where the density field ρ(s) and mass burning rate m(s) for a flame with a resolved preheating zone and infinitely thin reaction layer are presented.

        <p>Deviations from this linear behavior arise in the preheating zone due to temperature changes which influence the density. This finally leads to a significant effect near the reaction layer. A similar effect is in principle present when using m m b b 0 in the burnt gases and extrapolating to s = 0. However, this effect is much smaller than in mu because the reaction layer is much thinner than the preheating zone.

        <p>In this section we will validate the flame stretch theory by comparing the expressions for the mass burning rate with numerical simulations. First, methane-air flames are studied in a counterflow configuration. In order to study the behavior at strong stretch, the applied strain rate is increased up to the maximum level at which a steady flame exists. At higher strain rates the flame extinguishes. Second, we will investigate preferential diffusion effects in lean and rich propane-air flames. Different approximations in the theoretical strong stretch model will be assessed. Third, the mass burning rate of stretched lean methane-hydrogen-air flames is investigated to assess the theoretical model for fuels consisting of multiple components with different Lewis numbers.In this section we will validate the flame stretch theory by comparing the expressions for the mass burning rate with numerical simulations.

        <p>The objective of this section is to investigate the accuracy of the flame stretch theory for strongly stretched flames. This is done by comparing results obtained by the expression (52) with results from numerical simulations of back-to-back counterflow flames. Premixed lean methane-air (equivalence ratio ϕ = 0.7) counterflow flames are computed in the back-to-back configuration employing the GRI-Mech 3.0 reaction mechanism [50]. As a first step, we avoid preferential diffusion effects by setting the Lewis numbers to 1 for all species. For methane flames with an effective Lewis number close to 1, this is a valid assumption. Preferential diffusion effects are included in the analysis in the following sections. Steady flames are computed for a range of applied strain rates, a. Starting at a = -100 1 s , the strain is increased until no steady solution can be obtained. The last steady flame is found at a = × -1 65 10 3 1 . s .

        <p>In the previous part of this section we have shown that the linearized strong stretch theory is able to reproduce numerically computed mass burning rates of propane-air flames. The full theory therefore seems to be accurate, but it would be desirable if more simplified versions of the theory could be used, which would make interpretations easier. It was found that rich propane-air flames are governed by multiple Lewis numbers, while lean flames are dominated by the Lewis number of the fuel. On the other hand, simple expressions found in the literature (e.g., Ref. [40]) can only predict the qualitative behavior of these flame parameters. Furthermore, we noticed that if we restrict preferential diffusion effects to temperature variations ΔTb in stretched propane-air flames, the theory is still reasonably accurate. In the following part of this section, we will study different parts of the theory in more detail and for other flames. It is investigated whether temperature changes are dominant also in other flames. It is shown that this is generally not the case, but that the combination of temperature changes and equivalence ratio changes yields much more accurate results.

        <p>The explanation for this behavior can be found in ψ such that the contribu- tion to Eq. ( 74) is visible for each component. For lean flames, the contributions of ZC and ZH are larger than that of ZO, which reflects that m b 0 of a lean flame is more sensitive to changes in the fuel concentration than in the amount of oxidizer. It can be seen in Fig. 9 that the changes in ZC and enthalpy have the largest contributions to Eq. ( 74), while ZO and ZH have negligible effects on mi for these methane-air flames. Furthermore, the effects increase with decreasing equivalence ratio. To a large extent, this is caused by the higher sensitivity at lower ϕ (cf. Table 1). The mass burning rate of lean flames is more sensitive to changes in ϕ than that of stoichiometric ones. Although the separate contributions are comparable to the direct effect of stretch (i.e., the second term in the r.h.s. of Eq. ( 74)), the sum of the contributions is much smaller because the changes in ZC and h have opposite effects.

At higher hydrogen levels, the Markstein numbers increase again. The lines in Fig. 13 correspond to theoretical values of mi. Both the full theory (solid) and the one including ϕ and Ti changes (dashed) agree well with the numerical values for not too large amounts of hydrogen addition ( X H2 0 6 &lt; . ). At higher X H2 the theoretical models follow the trend of the numerical results, but the quantitative agreement is less. The main reason is that for a hydrogen flame ( X H2 1 = ) at low temperatures the heat release ωT as a function of the scaled temperature T is non-zero in a broad region. This means that the assumption that the reaction layer is thin compared to the preheating zone does not hold any more when reaching the pure hydrogen limit. In fact, the reaction layer shifts from the burnt side in the pure methane case to the leading edge of the flame for pure hydrogen. Neither the current theoretical model nor other existing models assuming a thin reaction layer take this behavior into account. The Markstein numbers presented in Fig. 13 correspond to the range of values given in literature. The behavior of M i as a function of X H2 was also observed in Ref. [53]. A quantitative com- parison is, however, not very useful because different configurations and definitions are used in literature.

The Markstein numbers presented in Fig. 13 correspond to the range of values given in literature. The behavior of M i as a function of X H2 was also observed in Ref. [53]. A quantitative com- parison is, however, not very useful because different configurations and definitions are used in literature. The actual value of M is, e.g., sensitive to the position in the flame at which m is evaluated. However, the trends as function of ϕ and X H2 presented here do not change and the conclusions remain the same.</p>
        <p>To conclude, we can say that changes in enthalpy and element mass fractions give rise to significant changes in mass burning rate. Predictions of mi using the full theory correspond well with numerical values. Simplified versions of the theory taking only changes in equivalence ratio or temperature into account are not sufficient to predict the numerical behavior of mi versus Ka i . Therefore, one should be careful applying theories or reduced numerical models that are based on one of these changes only. When variations in both temperature and equivalence ratio are included, the results are acceptable for the present case, though the large change in C to H ratio at the inner layer is not accounted for. This conclusion is not surprising since the burning velocity is to leading order dependent on temperature and equivalence ratio. This has been observed by others as well. However, unlike in previous studies, both separate effects are studied quantitatively here. Moreover, the theoretical model used in this study is able to predict these effects resulting in Markstein numbers that correspond both qualitatively and quantitatively with the numerical results for not too high amounts of hydrogen addition.To conclude, we can say that changes in enthalpy and element mass fractions give rise to significant changes in mass burning rate.

        <p>A generalized formalism has been introduced to split the full set of conservation equations for describing the detailed behavior of flames into a kinematic equation for the motion and dynamics of the flame front and a set of SSFE equations for the internal structure of the flame structure. The full dynamics of the flame can be very well approximated if the SSFE model is further reduced into a model in which the flame structure is split into a preheating zone, where detailed transport phenomena including stretch, curvature and preferential diffusion take place, and a much thinner reaction layer in which only chemical reaction and molecular diffusion take place and balance each other. This is shown in terms of an advanced flame stretch theory for the mass burning rate of flames, which reduces to existing weak stretch theories under certain conditions. The theoretical formalism has shown to be an excellent prediction of the dynamics of numerically modeled flames using detailed transport and chemistry, even in the case of (strong) flame stretch, curvature, elemental/enthalpy effects. This opens the way to formulate flamelet-based reduction techniques in which the chemical source term of the flame is accurately predicted. In such techniques, it is important to include major effects related to molecular diffusion in the chemical source term evaluation, but the inclusion of stretch, and curvature is less important inside the reaction layer, while these effects have to be resolved by the model in the thicker preheating zone. The reproduction of the enthalpy and the elemental composition at the reaction layer is, however, important and has to be included. The FGM model, developed and described in Part II, is based on these ideas.A generalized formalism has been introduced to split the full set of conservation equations for describing the detailed behavior of flames into a kinematic equation for the motion and dynamics of the flame front and a set of SSFE equations for the internal structure of the flame structure.

The applicability of FGM to partially premixed and nonpremixed laminar flames was also tested with success in Refs. [7,12,13,[58][59][60].

This manifold could have a large dimensionality N r N m e = + +1 in general, but it should be realized that Zj and h are often not independent, so that one does not need to treat each conserved quantity as an independent degree of freedom. For instance, the element mass fractions are not independent since ∑ = Z j 1. Furthermore, for fully premixed adiabatic flames (with Le i = 1), h and Zj are all constant and do not have to be treated as degree of freedom. For nonpremixed flames in an adiabatic two-fluid stream, h and Zj are dependent on a single degree of freedom, referred to as the mixture fraction Z, which leaves us with only one single degree of freedom for the conserved variables. So the manifold with the lowest dimensionality for fully premixed flames is a one-dimensional manifold with y1 as degree of freedom. If the accuracy is not good enough also y2 or y2 and y3 can be used. For partially-premixed and nonpremixed flames, one has to treat at least y1 and Z1 as degrees of freedom (see Refs. [59,61]) and if a higher accuracy is desired one could add y2 (or y2 and y3).Depending on the degrees of freedom of the combustion system, the reduced chemistry 'manifold' describes yk, for k r N N = + -1, , … e (and functions thereof) as a function of yi (with i = 1,. . .,r) and Zj, h.

        <p>There are different ways to define or approximate the solution of the manifold describing yk ( k r N N = + -1, , … e ) as a function of yi (i = 1,. . .,r), h and Zj. Let us first look at the full most accurate manifold definition and consider approximations afterwards. To derive the exact manifold equations, we transform the combustion equations to a flame-adapted coordinate system as derived in Section 2.1.3. This thus leads to the set of strongly stretched flamelet equations SSFE (Eq. 29). This set of SSFE defines the inner 'flamelet' structure and the local 'manifold' is governed by the magnitude of the different convective, diffusive and reactive time scales, expressed in the flame-adapted coordinate system. So for any reduced chemistry or flamelet-based model, the SSFE set forms the basis. The exact solution of a combustion CFD problem would be obtained, if the local values of the flame stretch, curvature and Qi-fields along flamelet paths in the CFD problem would be derived and the SSFE set would be solved with those fields, to determine the inner structure in terms of y k ( k r N N = + -1, , … e ). Although the focus has been on premixed flames in the derivation of the flamelet equations, the approach can also be applied to non-premixed flames. The flame coordinate system is then attached to iso-surfaces of the mixture fraction. This is explained in Appendix B.There are different ways to define or approximate the solution of the manifold describing yk ( k r N N = + -1, , … e ) as a function of yi (i = 1,. . .,r), h and Zj.

        <p>There are different ways to combine the manifold with the transport equations. In the G-equation flamelet model (see Ref. [16]), the kinematic equation is solved for the motion of an infinitely thin flame front, while the local mass burning rate m of this front is derived from some approximation of the SSFE set. A more complete model would be to solve the full kinematic equation, Eq. ( 13), and locally derive the mass burning rate m from the full SSFE set. This would mean that the original set of transport equations is solved exactly. This method was used by Groot et al. for modeling the motion of spherically expanding premixed laminar flames, but they found it to be not very stable in a numerical sense [38].There are different ways to combine the manifold with the transport equations.

        <p>To conclude, there are multiple ways to model flames based on the SSFE set. FGM is a promising technique for two reasons: First, it combines the accuracy of dimension reduction methods by solving a set of complete transport equations for y1,. . ., yr together with h and Zj, and second it does not only consider chemical steady-state of the SSFE set, but also takes into account most important transport effects. This is very important since flame structures are dominated by diffusion-reaction balances with a major influence of diffusion effects. This advantage of FGM was demonstrated by van Oijen et al. [6] by comparing a 1D FGM with a 1D ILDM for a premixed hydrogen-air flame. While at high temperatures close to chemical equilibrium the manifolds are similar, the FGM is more accurate in the colder parts of the reaction layer. In practice, it is too expensive to solve the full SSFE set (29) and we therefore approximate it by a representative set of solutions instead. How this is done is explained in the next subsection.To conclude, there are multiple ways to model flames based on the SSFE set.

        <p>In the previous section we explained that the set of SSFE equations forms the basis of the manifold of the FGM method. A local strongly stretched flamelet in a CFD problem may be computed from this set on the basis of local stretch fields K(s) and curvature fields σ(s) as input. Direct computation of this set for each flamelet in the combustion problem is too involved and we therefore restrict to best approximations of this set in practice. Convective, diffusive and chemical source terms are always involved, but some transport, curvature and stretch terms are neglected, depending on the situation. The Qi-terms are always neglected, as explained in Part I.In the previous section we explained that the set of SSFE equations forms the basis of the manifold of the FGM method.

        <p>The following procedure is used to derive the manifold from an approximation of the SSFE set. First, the conserved quantities h and Zj are considered. For the combustion system of interest, the number of independent 'mixing' parameters is evaluated. For instance, in case of a fully premixed system with unity Lewis numbers, Zj is constant, but h might be changing. In case of heat losses, h is changing and this is the only conserved scalar taken into account. To generate a 2D manifold that includes enthalpy variations, a series of 1D representative flamelets is solved with step-wise varying initial temperature to mimic the changes in h in the system. The 2D manifold is now parameterized by two scalars h and y1, while transport equations for h and y1 are solved during run-time. This is quite accurate for problems with constant Zj (See Section 3.3.2). However, in case of strong preferential diffusion effects, Zj and h are changing as well, even in case of a fully premixed combustion system. For that case one should also take into account variations in Zj and h as governed by the preferential diffusion phenomena. It is found that for some cases changes in Zj and h due to preferential diffusion are coupled, so that one may again define a 2D manifold with one parameter for these coupled variations in Zj and h. This is studied in Section 3.3.1. In case of a non-premixed system, at least one mixing parameter Z is needed to predict variations in Zj and h, but this could also increase if the elements and enthalpy are not coupled, e.g., in flames with more than two different inlet streams.The following procedure is used to derive the manifold from an approximation of the SSFE set. First, the conserved quantities h and Zj are considered. For the combustion system of interest, the number of independent 'mixing' parameters is evaluated. For instance, in case of a fully premixed system with unity Lewis numbers, Zj is constant, but h might be changing. In case of heat losses, h is changing and this is the only conserved scalar taken into account.

However, in case of strong preferential diffusion effects, Zj and h are changing as well, even in case of a fully premixed combustion system. For that case one should also take into account variations in Zj and h as governed by the preferential diffusion phenomena. It is found that for some cases changes in Zj and h due to preferential diffusion are coupled, so that one may again define a 2D manifold with one parameter for these coupled variations in Zj and h. This is studied in Section 3.3.1. In case of a non-premixed system, at least one mixing parameter Z is needed to predict variations in Zj and h, but this could also increase if the elements and enthalpy are not coupled, e.g., in flames with more than two different inlet streams.</p>
        <p>In any case, if the number of independent variations of Zj and h is known and parameterized, the principle method is to solve a set of 1D flames which mimic the combustion system best, by varying the inlet and/or boundary conditions according to the variations in conserved quantities. In case of premixed combustion systems, the flame curvature and stretch could be of interest. If that is the case, a series of 1D flamelets is solved with step-wise varying stretch and/ or curvature fields. In case of non-premixed or partially-premixed flames, a series of stagnation flames is solved, where the stagnation flow is governed by the stretch field. Again, boundary conditions are used which mimic the variations in Zj and h, but now on both sides of the flame. Contrary to the classical flamelet method, the solution is not parameterized in terms of mixture fraction Z and scalar dissipation rate χ = ∇ 2 2 D Z but by Z and y1. If auto-ignition and quenching phenomena are present in the combustion system, like in the case of engine combustion, the solution may have to contain unsteady flamelets in order to accurately predict these phenomena [63,64].In any case, if the number of independent variations of Zj and h is known and parameterized, the principle method is to solve a set of 1D flames which mimic the combustion system best, by varying the inlet and/or boundary conditions according to the variations in conserved quantities.

Computing representative flamelets 2. Building a look-up table 3. Coupling the table with a flow solver These three steps will be explained in the following.</p>
        <p>The first step consists of computing flamelets which are representative for the combustion system to which the FGM will be applied. It is obvious that when combustion takes place under (non-)premixed conditions in the application, the most representative flamelet is a (non-)premixed flamelet. The flamelets are computed by solving the flamelet equations (29) under the appropriate conditions. For a premixed flame this means that the boundary conditions correspond to an inflow of the reactants at one side (s → -∞) and an outflow at the other side. When we furthermore assume that σ = 1, K = 0, Qi = 0, and that the time derivatives (∂/∂τ) are zero, the equations describe the most elementary 1D premixed flamelet: an adiabatic, flat, stretchless, steady flame. CHEM1D [65] is a code that can solve the flamelet equations numerically employing detailed chemistry and transport models. The solution consists of the profiles of mass burning rate m, enthalpy h, and species mass fractions Yi as functions of the spatial coordinate s. Note that for this special case m is constant and an eigenvalue of the system. So the 1D flamelet solution yields the thermochemical variables φ parameterized by one variable: the spatial coordinate, φ = φ(s). When more degrees of freedom are required, e.g., to account for changes in Zj, h and p, multiple flamelets have to be computed.The first step consists of computing flamelets which are representative for the combustion system to which the FGM will be applied. It is obvious that when combustion takes place under (non-)premixed conditions in the application, the most representative flamelet is a (non-)premixed flamelet. The flamelets are computed by solving the flamelet equations (29) under the appropriate conditions. For a premixed flame this means that the boundary conditions correspond to an inflow of the reactants at one side (s → -∞) and an outflow at the other side. When we furthermore assume that σ = 1, K = 0, Qi = 0, and that the time derivatives (∂/∂τ) are zero, the equations describe the most elementary 1D premixed flamelet: an adiabatic, flat, stretchless, steady flame. CHEM1D [65] is a code that can solve the flamelet equations numerically employing detailed chemistry and transport models. The solution consists of the profiles of mass burning rate m, enthalpy h, and species mass fractions Yi as functions of the spatial coordinate s. Note that for this special case m is constant and an eigenvalue of the system. So the 1D flamelet solution yields the thermochemical variables φ parameterized by one variable: the spatial coordinate, φ = φ(s). When more degrees of freedom are required, e.g., to account for changes in Zj, h and p, multiple flamelets have to be computed.</p>
        <p>For instance, heat loss to the walls of the combustion chamber decreases the enthalpy h in the computational domain. In order to take this into account in the FGM tabulation process, laminar flamelets have to be solved for different values of enthalpy, introducing enthalpy as an additional degree of freedom. The enthalpy in an adiabatic premixed flame is constant and equal to the enthalpy of the burnt mixture, hb, apart from small local changes due to non-unity Lewis number effects. The enthalpy of the flamelets can be reduced by lowering the temperature of the reactants, dilute them with cold combustion products, computing burner-stabilized flames, by adding a radiation source term, or by rescaling the heat release source term. These different approaches are explained in Refs. [6,21,57,66,67]. With enthalpy as an additional parameter, the thermochemical state is parameterized by two variables: ϕ ϕ = ( ) s h , b .

        <p>The reason for the good agreement between FGM and detailed chemistry results can be found in Fig. 17, in which the chemical source term of the progress variable is plotted as a function of the progress variable for all stretch rates. The flamelet with a = 0 is shown with a red curve, all the other curves are blue. (For interpretation of the references to color in this text, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) It can be observed that the chemical source term is hardly changed by the applied stretch field. Therefore, the source term in the FGM, which was generated with a = 0, can also be used for cases with moderate stretch. At very high stretch rates ( Ka b 1), which may occur in turbulent flames, the reaction layer might be affected by flame stretch and additional degrees of freedom are required for the FGM. The observation that the source term occurs in a thin layer and is hardly changed by stretch when there are no preferential diffusion effects was the very basis of the strong stretch theory and the derivation of Eqs. ( 41) and ( 51) in Part I. The small changes in source term can be accounted for by increasing the dimension of the manifold. This was shown in Ref.

        <p>In Fig. 18 . the enthalpy has been decreased by 180 J/ g, which corresponds to a decrease in flame temperature Tb of approximately 100 K. This lower flame temperature has a direct effect on the reaction rates in the flame. This can be observed in Fig. 19, in which the source term of the progress variable is plotted as a function of the progress variable for flames with different stretch rates. Contrary to the unity Lewis number case shown in Fig. 17, the source term changes significantly. The lower temperature at high strain rates leads to a reduced source term. At the highest strain rate of a = -1000 1 s , the maximum of the source term is reduced by 25% of the value at a = 0.In Fig. 18 . the enthalpy has been decreased by 180 J/ g, which corresponds to a decrease in flame temperature Tb of approximately 100 K.

        <p>To account for this change in source term, the FGM is extended with enthalpy as an additional variable. To do so, a series of flamelets with different enthalpies has to be computed. Here we compare two ways to lower the enthalpy: The first manifold (FGM A) has been created by changing the temperature Tu of the reactants. Since it would require unrealistically low Tu to lower the enthalpy suffi-ciently, an alternative method is needed. This is done by computing 1D burner-stabilized flames [57]. By lowering the inlet gas velocity, the flame temperature and enthalpy are decreased. The second manifold (FGM B) was constructed from flamelets of which the reactants were diluted by cooled combustion products [6].

A third manifold (FGM C) was created in the same way as FGM A, but the flamelets were computed using unity Lewis numbers. Therefore, each flamelet has a constant enthalpy and shows no preferential diffusion effects.

        <p>In many engineering applications of combustion, fuel and oxidizer are not perfectly mixed before entering the combustion chamber and combustion occurs under partially premixed conditions. Since fuel and oxidizer are not perfectly mixed in partially premixed flames, variations in the element mass fractions Zj and enthalpy h are inevitable. The element mass fraction of carbon in a methane/air mixture for instance varies between ZC = 0.75 in pure methane and ZC = 0 in pure air. In non-premixed flames, the local equivalence ratio, which is determined by the local element composition, is usually described by the mixture fraction Z, which is defined in such a way that it is a conserved scalar unchanged by chemical reaction.

        <p>Here we want to isolate the effects of fuel stratification from heat loss effects. Therefore, we discuss the application of FGM to partially premixed flames in the context of triple flames as studied in Ref. [59]. A triple flame is a flame structure generated by flame propagation in a partially premixed system. A schematic representation of such a triple (or tribrachial) flame structure is shown in Fig. 24. In a partially premixed field the mixture fraction determines the local equivalence ratio and thereby the value of the mass burning rate. Since premixed flame speeds reach the maximum for near stoichiometric conditions, a flame in a partially premixed field propagates preferentially along surfaces of stoichiometric mixture, i.e., near Z Z = st . On the fuel-lean side of such a surface there is a lean premixed flame front and on the fuel-rich side there is a rich premixed flame front, both propagating with a lower burning velocity than the leading edge of the flame, called the triple point. Behind the partially premixed flame front, two streams, one containing unburnt intermediates like CO and H2, and the other unburnt oxidant, come together and burn as a diffusion flame.Here we want to isolate the effects of fuel stratification from heat loss effects.

        <p>In Ref. [59] a manifold was constructed from 1D premixed flamelets. Since the mixture fraction in such flamelets is conserved, changes in the mixture fraction as they occur in partially premixed flames have to be taken into account by adding Z as control variable to the manifold. The procedure to add Z as extra control variable is similar to the one described before for adding h as variable to account for enthalpy changes. Because the triple flames considered here are adiabatic, the enthalpy is not used as additional control variable. In order to add the mixture fraction as additional control variable, the 1D flamelet equations are solved for different values of the initial mixture fraction Z Z x -∞ = =-∞ ( ). The value of Z -∞ is simply changed by varying the ratio between fuel and air in the initial mixture. Since unity Lewis numbers are used, there are no differential diffusion effects and Z Z = -∞ in each flamelet.

[59] a manifold was constructed from 1D premixed flamelets. Since the mixture fraction in such flamelets is conserved, changes in the mixture fraction as they occur in partially premixed flames have to be taken into account by adding Z as control variable to the manifold. The procedure to add Z as extra control variable is similar to the one described before for adding h as variable to account for enthalpy changes. Because the triple flames considered here are adiabatic, the enthalpy is not used as additional control variable. In order to add the mixture fraction as additional control variable, the 1D flamelet equations are solved for different values of the initial mixture fraction Z Z x -∞ = =-∞ ( ).

        <p>A straightforward linear interpolation of the species mass fractions and enthalpy between the lean and rich flammability limit and the pure oxidizer and fuel composition, respectively, is commonly used and gives reasonable results (see, e.g., Refs. [85,86]). Linear extrapolation of the density leads to incorrect results because density is a non-linear function of the control variables. Therefore, it is better to calculate the density from the linear extrapolated mass fractions and enthalpy. Details of the numerical set-up of these triple flame simulations can be found in Ref. [59]. Fig. 25 shows iso-contours of temperature T and the species mass fractions Y CH4 , Y O2 , Y CO , YH and Y CH O 2 computed with detailed chemistry [82] and FGM. The lean and rich premixed flame branches of the triple flame (see Fig. 24) can clearly be identified in Fig. 25. The temperature rises from 300 K in the unburnt mixture to approximately 2000 K behind the premixed flame branches depending on the local stoichiometry. The highest temperatures of approximately 2150 K are found in regions of near-stoichiometric mixture. However, since heat is conducted away from the stoichiometric line, these temperatures are almost 100 K lower than the maximum equilibrium temperature of 2240 K.A straightforward linear interpolation of the species mass fractions and enthalpy between the lean and rich flammability limit and the pure oxidizer and fuel composition, respectively, is commonly used and gives reasonable results (see, e.g., Refs.

        <p>The steady propagation speed of this flame structure computed by using detailed chemistry is 44 0 1 . cm s -. When FGM is used, the propagation speed is 44 7 1 . cm s -; a difference less than two percent. For more details, the reader is referred to Ref. [59]. This small difference indicates that FGM yields accurate results for these triple flames. This is confirmed by the temperature and species profiles shown in Fig. 25. For most variables the results of the detailed and reduced chemistry computations agree very well. Since transport processes along the iso-surfaces of Y are not included in FGM, the CO formed on the fuel-rich side cannot diffuse along the premixed flame toward the fuel-lean side. Therefore, the CO concentration in the fuel-rich premixed flame branch is slightly overpredicted by FGM. This effect is very similar to the diffusion of CO toward the burner wall as discussed in the previous section. In this case, however, the variation along the flame surface is caused by a gradient in mixture fraction and, hence, the Q-term is proportional to the scalar dissipation rate χt of Z in the flame surface.The steady propagation speed of this flame structure computed by using detailed chemistry is 44 0 1 . cm s -.

However, when using FGM the results agree well with the results of detailed chemistry computations, though small differences can be observed.

These results have been computed using detailed chemistry, i.e., the GRI-Mech 3.0 reaction mechanism [50]. In the plot for mixture fraction, it can be seen that the inlet composition suddenly changes at t = 0 and t = 0.25 s. While this sudden change in mixture fraction travels with the gas velocity toward the flame front, it is smoothed by molecular diffusion. When this mixture fraction wave travels through the flame front, its wavelength is increased by the increase in gas velocity due to expansion of the reaction products. In the temperature plot, it can be seen that when the mixture fraction wave hits the flame front the temperature rises, because the stoichiometry changes from lean to stoichiometric. When the wave has passed the reaction front, the temperature decreases again since the conditions have changed from stoichiometric to rich. When the mixture fraction is changed back to lean conditions at t = 0.25 s, a similar but reversed process is observed.In Fig. 28 the profiles of mixture fraction Z, temperature T, and NO mass fraction Y NO are shown as a function of space s and time t.

        <p>The profiles of NO mass fraction closely follow the trend in the temperature profiles. When the mixture fraction is close to stoichiometry and the temperature is high, a lot of NO is produced. This results in a growing NO peak which is convected away from the flame front by the flow of burnt gases. This can also be observed in Fig. 29, in which snapshots of the NO profile are shown at three time instants. In the top figures the mixture fraction has just increased, in the middle figures a steady rich condition is obtained, and in the bottom figures the mixture fraction has just changed back to lean conditions.The profiles of NO mass fraction closely follow the trend in the temperature profiles.

        <p>In Fig. 29 the results of FGM simulations with the two different approaches and different values of α are shown as well. The results with α = 10 indicate that adding a small amount of NO to the progress variable does not prevent large interpolation errors. In fact, for this value of α the profile of NO is still not resolved by the grid spacing used in the look-up table. The interpolation errors result in an overestimation of the mass fraction of NO, but an underestimation of its chemical source term. For larger values of α, the results become more accurate. The steady situation at t = 0.25 s is then very well captured by both approaches. However, the unsteady parts of the simulation are more accurately predicted by the approach in which a transport equation for NO is solved. The direct lookup ap-proach gives only acceptable results for α = 10 3 . Note that in the limit α → ∞, both approaches are the same because then the progress variable Y is equivalent to Y NO .

The reaction zone, however, is not significantly affected by the flow structures. This is the typical behavior expected in the thin-reaction zones regime [16]. For case T2, it was found that not only the structure of the preheat zone but also that of the reaction zone was altered by the turbulent flow, which is characteristic for combustion in the distributed-reaction zones regime.

        <p>Due to the large stretch rates observed in these flames, one might wonder whether the 1D FGM model applied in the DNS is valid for these conditions. The fact that the flame stretch theory accurately predicts the mass burning rate may be interpreted as a positive sign because the FGM method is based on the same flamelet equations with similar assumptions. However, in order to assess the accuracy of the FGM model a comparison with simulations employing the full kinetic mechanism is desired. The most direct way would be by performing a DNS of the same case with detailed chemistry. Since such a DNS would require enormous computational power, which is not available to everyone, other approaches have been used. In Ref. [98], the FGM model was validated by comparing it with detailed chemistry solutions of the flamelet equations for the flame paths in the DNS results with the actual flame stretch rate K and surface σ as shown in Fig. 31. Neglecting the unsteady terms and the Q terms, the flamelet equations were solved for O 10 4 ( ) flame paths with a 1D flame code using both FGM and detailed chemistry.Due to the large stretch rates observed in these flames, one might wonder whether the 1D FGM model applied in the DNS is valid for these conditions. The fact that the flame stretch theory accurately predicts the mass burning rate may be interpreted as a positive sign because the FGM method is based on the same flamelet equations with similar assumptions. However, in order to assess the accuracy of the FGM model a comparison with simulations employing the full kinetic mechanism is desired. The most direct way would be by performing a DNS of the same case with detailed chemistry. Since such a DNS would require enormous computational power, which is not available to everyone, other approaches have been used. In Ref. [98], the FGM model was validated by comparing it with detailed chemistry solutions of the flamelet equations for the flame paths in the DNS results with the actual flame stretch rate K and surface σ as shown in Fig. 31.

        <p>Although 3D DNS with detailed chemistry is extremely expensive and only possible with petascale computing power [92], 2D simulations with detailed chemistry are tractable on affordable computer clusters. Despite the fact that 2D turbulence behaves very differently from 3D turbulence, 2D DNS studies can yield very useful information on how vortical flow fields interact with flame fronts and how the internal structure of the flame front in terms of species and temperature profiles is affected by flame stretch and curvature. As an example, we discuss the validation of FGM in a 2D DNS study of lean premixed methanehydrogen-air flame kernels [101]. The fuel mixture consists of 60% methane and 40% hydrogen by volume and is premixed with air at an equivalence ratio of ϕ = 0.7. Apart from the fresh gas mixture and the dimensionality of the problem, the simulation setup is the same as applied in the studies discussed so far in this section [33,98]. However, as it was shown in Section 2.3.2.3, the presence of hydrogen with a Lewis number of 0.3 in the fuel leads to strong preferential diffusion effects, which affect the mass burning rate and hence the dynamics of the flame front. To capture the variations in enthalpy and element mass fractions caused by preferential diffusion effects, the manifold needs to be extended with additional dimensions as explained in Section 3.3.1. There, it was shown that one additional degree of freedom is enough to describe this effect for small Karlovitz numbers. Here we will investigate whether this also holds for the present fuel mixture of methane and hydrogen.Although 3D DNS with detailed chemistry is extremely expensive and only possible with petascale computing power [92], 2D simulations with detailed chemistry are tractable on affordable computer clusters.

        <p>This set of control variables results in a monotonic parametrization of both manifolds. The chemical source term of the progress variable in FGM A is shown in Fig. 34. The source term increases for higher values of Z , which corresponds to an in- creased burning rate at richer conditions. The two flamelet curves demonstrate that a positive stretch rate leads to an increase in Z which is in agreement with the results in Fig. 12. Both manifolds are used to compute strained flames similar to the study in Section 3.3.1. Results obtained with the 2D manifolds are compared with results of calculations using detailed chemistry (GRI-Mech 3.0 [50]) and a 1D FGM. In Fig. 35 the mass burning rate is plotted versus Karlovitz integral. The results computed using detailed chemistry show the strong effect of preferential diffusion. These effects were analyzed in detail in Section 2.3.2.3. Fig. 35 also shows the results of calculations that employ a complex transport model, which solves the Stefan-Maxwell equations and includes thermal diffusion [29]. The results indicate that the simplified transport model with constant Lewis numbers (Eq. 2) is also valid for this fuel with high hydrogen content. The 1D FGM cannot predict the preferential diffusion effects because it does not include changes in hb and Z j,b . Both 2D FGMs, however, predict the correct trend in mass burning rate. This good agreement and the small difference between the two 2D FGMs indicate that one degree of freedom is sufficient to describe the changes in enthalpy and element mass fractions, and that it is not very important how they are imposed.This set of control variables results in a monotonic parametrization of both manifolds.

        <p>The 2D FGM A is used in DNS of an expanding flame kernel and compared with the 1D FGM and the detailed mechanism [50]. Snapshots of the mass fraction of the hydrogen radical, which is an important intermediate in hydrocarbon oxidation and an indicator for the fuel consumption rate, are shown in Fig. 36. The detailed result shows the increased mass fraction of H in parts of the flame front that are curved outward. These parts of the flame are positively stretched and become richer due to preferential diffusion effects (see Section 2.3.2.3). This local increase in stoichiometry leads to an increase in mass burning rate, which attributes to the cellular instability of lean flames with Le &lt; 1 [102]. While the 1D FGM cannot predict the change in Zj, the 2D FGM reproduces the detailed chemistry results very well. The increased H mass fractions in the outward curved parts are very well predicted. At closer inspection, however, one can still find differences. Due to the variations of species mass fractions along isocontours of the progress variable, diffusion in this direction starts to play a role. Delhaye [36] performed a quantitative analysis of all terms in the flamelet equations (29) for a similar DNS of a lean methane-air mixture as shown in Fig. 1. He found that the Q-terms are mostly much smaller than the stretch and curvature terms, but in the part with the highest curvature, where the curvature radius is comparable to the thickness of the reaction layer δr, the Q-terms become comparable in magnitude. Since Delhaye investigated a methane flame with a near unity Lewis number, the variations in Zj along the flame front are not as large as in the present methane-hydrogen mixture. Therefore, the Q-terms are expected to be larger for the present case. For an accurate representation of these tangential diffusion fluxes, additional degrees of freedom have to be added to the manifold.The 2D FGM A is used in DNS of an expanding flame kernel and compared with the 1D FGM and the detailed mechanism [50].

        <p>DNS modeling of lean methane-hydrogen-air mixtures with FGM is extensively described by de Swart et al. [103]. Three different methane-hydrogen ratios were studied in 2D simulations of flamevortex interaction and 3D simulations of statistically planar turbulent flames in the thin reaction zones regime. In this work, a similar flame path analysis was performed as described at the beginning of this section. Stretch and curvature profiles were computed and used to calculate the Karlovitz integrals. From the scatter plots of the scaled mass burning rate m/m 0 versus Karlovitz integrals, Markstein numbers M were obtained using linear least-squares fits. The Markstein numbers were found to decrease with increasing hydrogen content, in line with the results presented in Fig. 13. However, the change in M appeared to be much smaller than in the steady laminar flames. The changes in element mass fractions ΔZ j,b and enthalpy Δhb in flame paths in the DNS were not as large as in steady laminar flames with the same Karlovitz number. This difference can be attributed to the unsteadiness of K and σ. When these variables change in time, the element mass fractions will follow with a finite response time. This is demonstrated in Fig. 37, in which the evolution of ΔZ j,b is shown for a flat flame that is subjected to a sudden change in stretch rate. The flame is initially not stretched and ΔZ j,b = 0, but at t = 0 the stretch rate is increased to K = -10 3 1 s and the element mass fractions start to change. However, it takes about two flame time scales τf = δf/sL before the steady values are reached. This finite response time causes the flame to act as a low band-pass filter, effectively averaging out the effect of the stretch rate fluctuations. Note that expressions (43b) and (43a) for ΔZ j,b and Δhb do not include this transient effect because the unsteady terms ∂/∂τ were ignored in their derivation. In the FGM approach, however, transport equations are solved for Zj and h if they are control variables, which implies that this unsteady effect can be accounted for.DNS modeling of lean methane-hydrogen-air mixtures with FGM is extensively described by de Swart et al.

        <p>The local variations in Zj and h lead to a change in mass burning rate m, which on its turn affects the propagation of the flame front. This effect is not clearly visible in Fig. 36 because only one eddyturnover time was simulated and in this time span the movement of the flame front is mainly determined by the velocity of the gas. The effect of preferential diffusion on the dynamics of the flame was investigated by Vreman et al. [104] by using FGM in DNS. Premixed turbulent flames of lean methane-hydrogen-air mixtures were simulated on a slot burner geometry that was based on the experiments of Filatyev et al. [105] and that was used in earlier FGM-DNS studies of methane combustion [106,107]. In this study the preferential diffusion effects were demonstrated by comparing a 1D FGM without changes in Zj and h, with a 2D FGM that does account for these changes. In Fig. 38, instantaneous contours of the progress variable source term are shown for both cases. The FGM model with preferential diffusion effects (Fig. 38b) shows an increase in the source term in regions of the flame front that are convex with respect to the unburnt mixture and vice versa. Therefore, the flame front becomes more wrinkled than in case of the 1D FGM. This increase in flame surface density leads to an increase in the averaged burning rate and a shorter averaged flame length. In Ref. [104], the turbulent burning velocity was found to increase by 30% when preferential diffusion was included. The change in local equivalence ratio does not only affect the mass burning rate but it also changes the NO production rate, because the flame temperature changes. The NO mass fraction was found to increase by approximately a factor two at the burnt side of the convex flame front in Fig. 38b. Variations in equivalence ratio at the flame front are not only caused by preferential diffusion, but they also arise often due to imperfect premixing of fuel and oxidizer. The effect of such a fuel stratification on the dynamics of the flame was investigated in a similar numerical setup with DNS-FGM by Ramaekers et al. [108].The local variations in Zj and h lead to a change in mass burning rate m, which on its turn affects the propagation of the flame front.

        <p>In the previous section, it was shown that the use of FGM in DNS yields results close to results of detailed chemistry calculations, but at a fraction of the computational cost. This makes it possible to perform DNS of high Reynolds number flows in real burners (see e.g., Moureau et al. [109]). In practice, however, a DNS is still too costly for most applications and RANS or LES approaches have to be used. Typically, two types of models are required in order to close the first moment equations of turbulent reacting flows with flamelet based tables. First, a fluid mechanical model must describe the unresolved stress and flux terms. Usually, eddy-viscosity and gradient transport assumptions are employed to close these terms [26]. Second, a closure method is needed for the mean values of the highly non-linear chemical terms, such as the averaged source term, density, temperature and species mass fractions.In the previous section, it was shown that the use of FGM in DNS yields results close to results of detailed chemistry calculations, but at a fraction of the computational cost.

        <p>First implementations of FGM in RANS of premixed turbulent flames are described in Refs. [12,110]. In these studies, 3D manifolds with Y , Z and h as control variables are used and the chemical closure problem is tackled by describing the control variables in a stochastic way. It is assumed that locally the probability of occurrence of a certain state is described by a presumed shape probability density function (PDF). Usually, the joint PDF of the control variables is written as a product of the marginal PDFs assuming statistical independence of the variables. Beta functions parameterized by the first two Favre averaged moments (mean and variance) are used to describe the marginal PDFs. The combination of a tabulated premixed flamelet with a beta PDF for RANS modeling of turbulent combustion was already introduced by Bradley et al. [111] in 1988. Cook and Riley [112] proposed to use the beta PDF for the modeling of unresolved terms in the context of LES. Since then it has become a standard closure technique in both LES and RANS, although various other PDF shapes have been proposed and used successfully as well [113,114].First implementations of FGM in RANS of premixed turbulent flames are described in Refs.

        <p>The computational cost of LES is much larger than for RANS, because LES is intrinsically unsteady and requires a finer grid to resolve a sufficient part of the turbulent length scales in the flow. However, since a larger part of the turbulent fluctuations is resolved and the modeled terms are much smaller, LES has a superior accuracy compared to RANS. Together with the continuous increase in available computer power, this has led to considerable attention for LES modeling in recent years. FGM or other tabulated chemistry models have been combined with many different approaches to close the unresolved or sub-grid scale terms in LES. An overview of various approaches to couple tabulated chemistry with LES is given in a review by Fiorina et al. [115].

Several of these LES approaches have been used recently by various groups to simulate the turbulent stratified flame experiments performed at TU Darmstadt [126,127]. A comparison of these LES results is described in a joint paper [128]. Good predictions were found for all the models that were based on premixed flamelet tables that included mixture fraction and enthalpy as additional degrees of freedom. Since the premixed flamelet models performed well, it is expected that the diffusion fluxes tangential to the flame front (Qterms in Eq. ( 31)) are relatively small for this mild stratified flame, although a quantitative analysis was not given in Ref. [128]. Including heat loss by adding enthalpy as a control variable was necessary to quench the flame near the cold burner tip leading to a lifted flame as it was observed in the experiments.The computational cost of LES is much larger than for RANS, because LES is intrinsically unsteady and requires a finer grid to resolve a sufficient part of the turbulent length scales in the flow.

Good predictions were found for all the models that were based on premixed flamelet tables that included mixture fraction and enthalpy as additional degrees of freedom. Since the premixed flamelet models performed well, it is expected that the diffusion fluxes tangential to the flame front (Qterms in Eq. ( 31)) are relatively small for this mild stratified flame, although a quantitative analysis was not given in Ref. [128]. Including heat loss by adding enthalpy as a control variable was necessary to quench the flame near the cold burner tip leading to a lifted flame as it was observed in the experiments.</p>
        <p>Another setup, in which the modeling of heat loss has been investigated, is the confined premixed jet experiment performed at the German Aerospace Center (DLR). This geometry was selected and analyzed experimentally in Refs. [129,130] because of the pro-nounced recirculation zone that arises due to the off-center position of the jet-nozzle exit. The strong recirculation of the hot product leads to a large heat loss to the walls of the combustion chamber, effectively lowering the flame temperature. RANS simulations of this setup were presented by Domenico et al. [131] and Donini et al. [132]. In Ref. [132], the FGM method was applied and both adiabatic and non-adiabatic manifolds were used to model the flame. As to be expected, the FGM with enthalpy as additional control variable gave much more accurate results. Excellent agreement was found between the non-adiabatic FGM results and measured temperature and velocity profiles in the region close to the nozzle. At farther distance (more than 10 nozzle diameters) the agreement was found to be less satisfactory. The differences were principally attributed to the RANS modeling, which was not able to predict the extent of the recirculation zone in an accurate way. More recently, Proch and Kempf [66] performed LES of the same setup combining FGM with an artificial thickened flame model. They also investigated the inclusion of heat loss and basically came to the same conclusion. Furthermore, they compared two different ways to lower the enthalpy of the flamelets. It was found that this choice has almost no effect on the result, which is in line with findings of laminar flame studies (see, e.g., Ref. [57], and Section 3.3.1). Although the LES predictions were more accurate than the RANS ones, the flame length was still not in perfect agreement with the measurements. Proch and Kempf attributed the underprediction of the flame length to flame stretch effects.Another setup, in which the modeling of heat loss has been investigated, is the confined premixed jet experiment performed at the German Aerospace Center (DLR).

        <p>The last test case that will be discussed here is a turbulent swirling flame in a laboratory-scale gas turbine combustor developed at DLR. This modified version of a practical gas turbine combustor has been extensively investigated by Weigand, Meier and coworkers [133,134]. This burner setup provides a suitable test case for verification and validation of combustion models, given the challenging complexity of the flow and the availability of a comprehensive set of experimental measurements. Donini et al. [135] applied the FGM method in combination with a presumed PDF approach in an LES of this setup. Since the fuel (methane) is injected separately from the air, the mixture fraction has to be used as additional control variable. Additionally, enthalpy is used as control variable to account for heat losses due to gas radiation and convective cooling at the combustor walls. The complex flow behavior characterized by inner and outer recirculation zones and a precessing vortex core, as well as the stabilization of the flame are accurately predicted by the numerical model. A detailed discussion of the flow pattern and a comparison with measurements is given in Ref. [135]. In Fig. 39, the computed instantaneous and time-averaged distributions of the control variables are shown. High turbulence levels in the shear layers near the inlet lead to fast mixing of fuel and air. At the location of the flame front, they are almost completely premixed and burn in a premixed mode. This is confirmed by an analysis of the resolved scalar dissipation rate χ, which drops from approximately 10 3 near the inlet to values below 1 s -1 at the flame front. The scalar dissipation rate in the flame surface, for which χt ≤ χ holds, is therefore much smaller than the flame time scale sL/δf. The low scalar dissipation rate indicates that the related Q-terms in the flamelet equations can be ignored. Heat loss to the combustor walls leads to a significant enthalpy deficit in the outer recirculation, but the region where the flame stabilizes is nearly adiabatic. Strong enthalpy gradients can therefore be neglected in the FGM modeling of this case. However, when the flame front comes close to the wall, local quenching may occur and the enthalpy gradients will have the same length scale as the flame thickness. In that case, large Q-terms are expected as was demonstrated for the laminar flame in Section 3.3.2.The last test case that will be discussed here is a turbulent swirling flame in a laboratory-scale gas turbine combustor developed at DLR.

        <p>The FGM model was also used to predict NO concentrations in this combustor by solving a transport equation with the source term obtained from the look-up table as discussed in Section 3.3.4. The predicted NO level in the exhaust of the combustor was in excellent agreement with the measured value of 6 ppm. The influence of gas radiation on the NO emission was found to be small, but ignoring heat loss to the walls resulted in an overprediction of 50% due to an overestimation of flame temperature.The FGM model was also used to predict NO concentrations in this combustor by solving a transport equation with the source term obtained from the look-up table as discussed in Section 3.3.4.

        <p>In Part II, the basics of the FGM approach have been presented and its application in laminar and turbulent premixed flames has been discussed. The principle idea of the method consists of a combination of reduced chemistry and laminar flamelet models. It was shown that the FGM method can be derived from the strongly stretched flamelet equations taking the major convective and diffusive effects into account. A complete FGM model is obtained when the actual flame stretch and curvature profiles from the CFD calculation are included in the SSFE, which have to be solved at run time. In practice, this is computationally too expensive and the SSFE are solved in a pre-processing step assuming representative conditions. The representative flamelets constitute a manifold which is parameterized by control variables and stored in a database. Methods to store the manifold and to couple it to a flow solver are presented and discussed.In Part II, the basics of the FGM approach have been presented and its application in laminar and turbulent premixed flames has been discussed.

        <p>The FGM method was further validated and applied step-bystep to various laminar combustion cases. First, the modeling of stretch effects was investigated. It was shown that a manifold constructed from stretchless flamelets can accurately predict the mass burning rate of stretched laminar flames because the chemical source terms are hardly influenced by stretch. Only in combination with preferential diffusion, flame stretch leads to a change in chemical source terms, because the element mass fractions and enthalpy change. When these changes are included in the manifold by adding additional dimensions, the effect of preferential diffusion on the mass burning rate is predicted by FGM. While for low Karlovitz numbers one additional dimension is enough, more degrees of freedom are required at high stretch rates.The FGM method was further validated and applied step-bystep to various laminar combustion cases.

        <p>Second, the modeling of heat loss by using FGM was studied. It was shown that by using a 2D FGM with enthalpy as an additional control variable, the stabilization of a premixed flame on a cooled burner can be accurately modeled. Stretch and curvature effects in the tip of this methane-air flame were accurately predicted by the 2D FGM. Close to the burner wall, where the flame quenches, diffusion along iso-surfaces of the progress variable cannot be neglected leading to small inaccuracies.Second, the modeling of heat loss by using FGM was studied.

        <p>Third, the FGM method was used to simulate triple flames in order to investigate its application in partially-premixed systems. To account for mixture fraction variations in the FGM method, Z was added to the manifold as an additional control variable. The agreement between the detailed chemistry and FGM results was very satisfactory. Since transport of species along iso-surfaces of Y is not included in the FGM computations, differences appear for species, whose concentration changes significantly along the premixed flame front. The differences between FGM and full chemistry results are small for the flames studied here because the length scale of the variations along the flame front is much larger than the premixed flame thickness.

The enhanced accuracy of this combined approach for partially premixed flames, however, did not outweigh the additional complexity of the implementation in their study.1 is in the same order as δf, additional degrees of freedom will be required in the FGM.

        <p>Finally, the modeling of NO formation was discussed in the context of laminar flame simulations. The slow chemical time scales of NO formation (or other slow chemical processes) form a challenge for the FGM method because they result in very steep gradients in the manifold, which lead to severe interpolation errors when NO or its source term is retrieved from the database. Adding NO to the definition of the progress variable results in a smoother mapping of the NO mass fraction and its chemical source term and reduces the interpolation errors. When a transport equation is solved for NO and its source term is well resolved, the FGM results closely match the detailed results. In general, we can conclude that the FGM method can predict accurately and efficiently the structure and dynamics of laminar flames including emission formation.Finally, the modeling of NO formation was discussed in the context of laminar flame simulations.

        <p>In Section 3.4, the application and accuracy of the FGM method in simulations of turbulent flames were investigated. First, the application of FGM in DNS was discussed. Premixed expanding flame kernels were simulated and their interaction with the turbulent flow was analyzed. Turbulent eddies distorted the preheat zone of the flame and lead to large varying flame stretch rates. The accuracy of the FGM approach was assessed by reconstructing flame paths form the turbulent flame and solving the flamelet equations for these paths with detailed chemistry and FGM.

        <p>A direct comparison with detailed chemistry calculations was shown for a 2D DNS of a methane-hydrogen flame kernel. The large preferential diffusion effects caused by flame stretch and curva-ture in this flame require additional dimensions in the manifold to capture changes in enthalpy and element mass fractions. As in the laminar test cases, a 2D FGM reproduces the detailed results very well, while the 1D FGM cannot account for the changes in h and Z j. Small deviations in highly curved regions of the flame are attributed to large Q-terms due to large tangential diffusion fluxes. In order to improve the FGM modeling, these Q-terms might have to be included in the flamelet calculations. The relevance of these preferential diffusion effects was investigated in FGM-DNS of premixed methane-hydrogen-air combustion on a slot burner. The variations in stoichiometry lead to changes in local burning rate that in turn lead to more flame wrinkling and therefore a shorter averaged flame length with an increased turbulent flame speed.A direct comparison with detailed chemistry calculations was shown for a 2D DNS of a methane-hydrogen flame kernel.

        <p>For application in LES or RANS, the FGM method needs to be coupled with a turbulence model that accounts for unresolved terms in the governing equations. Many different approaches exist to close these terms and to couple FGM with LES or RANS. The presumed PDF approach is probably the most widely used method, but more advanced methods are being developed and are gaining interest. Several test cases were discussed, in which the role of fuel stratification and heat loss was investigated. It was found that LES with manifolds based on premixed flamelets with additional degrees of freedom to account for variations in mixture fraction and enthalpy, in general yields satisfactory agreement with measurements. The results obtained for the DLR gas-turbine combustor demonstrate the large potential of FGM in combination with LES for the modeling of combustion in real devices.For application in LES or RANS, the FGM method needs to be coupled with a turbulence model that accounts for unresolved terms in the governing equations.

        <p>State-of-the-art of the Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) technique has been reviewed and consolidated. The FGM technique is one possible solution to the important problem to model the detailed structure of flames described by complex chemistry and transport processes in a much more efficient and fast way. This is not done by solving all transport equations at hand, but by reducing this set to a few equations describing the main progress in the flame, while detailed information on all other relevant parameters is stored in a database, prepared before the actual flame computation. The basic idea of the FGM technique is that the flame structure is a combination of a preheating zone where detailed transport phenomena including stretch, curvature and preferential diffusion effects take place and a much thinner reaction layer in which only chemical reaction and molecular diffusion take place and balance each other. The chemical source term, perturbed and balanced by molecular diffusion effects, is the key information stored in the FGM database. This chemical source is not very sensitive to stretch and curvature, but major effects due to changes in conserved variables like pressure, enthalpy and elemental composition at the reaction layer must be taken into account. This is invoked by creating a multiple-dimensional manifold, generated by choosing a set of appropriate flamelets in which the same or similar perturbations appear. A generalized flame stretch theory, based on these ideas, has been developed to show this and to analyze the flame dynamics. The FGM technique has been applied with success to many DNS studies of laminar and turbulent flames in which all phenomena in the preheating zone are resolved, while the source term has been prepared and stored on the basis of the above principles. Heat loss, fuel stratification, flame stretch and preferential diffusion effects have been accounted for. Diffusion transport along iso-surfaces of the progress variable is, however, not accounted for. This leads to inaccuracies in regions of intense cooling or mixing where large gradients of enthalpy and element mass fractions occur.

        <p>The application of the FGM model in 'unresolved' models using LES or RANS for the flow field is also studied. To cover the unresolved behavior, various approaches exist of which the presumed PDF method is probably the most applied one. This model has appeared to be very promising as well, but there are many open questions to be asked. Important questions are, for instance, what the shape and structure of the PDF should be and how to model accurately the propagation of a flame front which is much thinner than the mesh size. New ideas in the direction of this last problem are currently under investigation, e.g., by the preparation of flamelets, suitably filtered to recover the correct propagation and dynamics of the thin embedded fronts (see e.g., Refs. [107,109,[122][123][124]). Another question is how to include preferential diffusion effects in 'unresolved' models. In DNS the interaction between flame stretch and preferential diffusion was found to play an important role, but in LES this effect happens at the sub-grid scale and requires proper modeling.The application of the FGM model in 'unresolved' models using LES or RANS for the flow field is also studied.

        <p>In Part II the flamelet equations are used to derive reduced chemistry models. While the focus is on premixed flames in the derivation of the flamelet equations (29) in Part I, the approach can also be used for non-premixed flames. It might be confusing to use Eq. ( 29) to derive reduced combustion models for premixed as well as for non-premixed flames, because normally the quantities in this set of equations are typically used for premixed flames and not for nonpremixed flames. For instance, m = ρsd is the mass burning rate which is a quantity normally used to analyze premixed flames. However, in the derivation of the FGM method and the SSFE set, it makes in principle no difference what kind of flame geometry is studied. Therefore, we generalize the concept of m to arbitrary flames and use this quantity to study these flames instead of the so-called scalar dissipation rate χ which has been used in laminar flamelet methods for non-premixed flames so far [16]. The question then is, how should sL or m be interpreted in case of non-premixed flames? To answer this question, let us consider a non-premixed flame defined in terms of the progress variable y1 which might be a reactive progress variable Y . However, to be able to study the relation with existing laminar flamelet models for diffusion flames we chose the mixture fraction Z as first progress variable. The velocity of a point on a flame iso-surface (with Z as constant) in time equals vf, while the local flow velocity equals v giving the kinematic equation: A coordinate transformation as presented in Section 2.1.3 is introduced subsequently and the transformed set of equations again reduces to Eq. ( 29), but now with m given by Eq. (100). A reduced 'manifold' defined by Eq. ( 29) can now be generated in one way or another (e.g., ILDM, FGM, PS-ILDM, etc). For instance, in case of a two-step reduced mechanism applied to a diffusion flame, y1 and Z can be used as the two first control variables in case of ILDM and FGM. In case of traditional laminar flamelet models, Z and the scalar dissipation rate χ = ∇ 2 2 D Z are used instead. m now replaces the role of the scalar dissipation rate as a measure for the importance of diffusive time scales. The relation between these two variables can be written in simple form if ρD is taken constant, σ = 1 and Lewis numbers are equal to unity.

( 29), but now with m given by Eq. (100). A reduced 'manifold' defined by Eq. ( 29) can now be generated in one way or another (e.g., ILDM, FGM, PS-ILDM, etc). For instance, in case of a two-step reduced mechanism applied to a diffusion flame, y1 and Z can be used as the two first control variables in case of ILDM and FGM. In case of traditional laminar flamelet models, Z and the scalar dissipation rate χ = ∇ 2 2 D Z are used instead. m now replaces the role of the scalar dissipation rate as a measure for the importance of diffusive time scales. The relation between these two variables can be written in simple form if ρD is taken constant, σ = 1 and Lewis numbers are equal to unity. We then have:</p>
